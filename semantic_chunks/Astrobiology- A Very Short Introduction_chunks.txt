Behind the name ‘What the hell is astrobiology ?’ an American Secret Service agent cried into his walkie-talkie. He had just been checking the identity of an academic visitor to NASA’s Ames Research Center, near San Francisco. The visitor had said that he was attending NASA’s ﬁ rst astrobiology science conference. Ames has an airstrip that provides a secure landing site for Air Force One, and, in April 2000, President Bill Clinton had just ﬂ own in to visit the San Francisco Bay area, bringing along his Secret Service entourage. The agent’s question was a fair one. It was only in the late 1990s that a scientiﬁ c consensus emerged about the meaning of astrobiology . Few laymen or Secret Service agents would have heard of the term. Back then, NASA began to promote a research programme in astrobiology led by Ames, where I was working as a space scientist. At ﬁ rst, some of my colleagues disliked the literal Greek meaning of the ‘biology of stars’. One noted with a scoff how life couldn’t exist inside the infernos of stars. A less curmudgeonly interpretation is that the ‘astro’ in astrobiology concerns life around stars, including the Sun, or simply life in space. In fact, many astrobiologists are as much concerned with the history of life on Earth as with life elsewhere. Astrobiologists agree that we should have a ﬁ rm understanding of how life evolved on Earth in Astrobiology 2order to ponder the existence of life in outer space. Yet one of the astonishing aspects of modern science is that it has so far failed to answer questions about biology that even a child might ask. How did life on Earth get started?

get started? We have some ideas but the details are unknown. Which special properties of the Earth and the Solar System make our planet habitable? Again, some thoughts but there is still much to learn. And what caused life to evolve into complex organisms instead of remaining simple? Again, we’re uncertain. To ﬁ ll these holes in human knowledge, astrobiology has emerged as a branch of science concerned with the study of the origin and evolution of life on Earth and the possible variety of life elsewhere . This is my own preferred deﬁ nition. NASA has deﬁ ned astrobiology as the study of the origins, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe . Other common deﬁ nitions are the study of life in the universe or the study of life in a cosmic context . Within this purview, astrobiologists pursue the question ‘What’s the history and future of terrestrial life?’ as well as ‘Is there life elsewhere?’ Four developments coincided with the emergence of astrobiology as a discipline in the late 1990s. In 1996, controversial signs of ancient life were described within a Martian meteorite—a 1.9 kilogram piece of rock that had been blasted off the surface of Mars by an asteroid impact and had eventually landed in Antarctica. Whether the interpretation of fossilized microscopic life was correct or not (see Chapter 6 ), it set people thinking. Furthermore, over the preceding two decades, biologists had established that some microbes not only tolerated a much larger range of environments than had previously been thought but actually thrived in extremes of temperature, acid, pressure, or salinity. So it became plausible to contemplate extraterrestrial microbes existing in seemingly hostile places. A third ﬁ nding came in 1996 from pictures taken by NASA’s Galileo spacecraft of the ice-covered surface of Jupiter’s moon, Europa, which revealed
