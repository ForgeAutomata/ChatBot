Edition I have retained the objectives and approaches for teaching materials science and engineering that were presented in previous editions.

previous editions. The first, and primary, objective is to present the basic fundamentals on a level appropriate for university/college students who have completed their freshmen calculus, chemistry, and physics courses. In order to achieve this goal, I have endeavored to use terminologythat is familiar to the student who is encountering the discipline of materials scienceand engineering for the first time, and also to define and explain all unfamiliar terms. The second objective is to present the subject matter in a logical order, from the simple to the more complex. Each chapter builds on the content of previous ones. The third objective, or philosophy, that I strive to maintain throughout the text is that if a topic or concept is worth treating, then it is worth treating in sufficientdetail and to the extent that students have the opportunity to fully understand itwithout having to consult other sources; also, in most cases, some practical relevanceis provided. Discussions are intended to be clear and concise and to begin atappropriate levels of understanding. The fourth objective is to include features in the book that will expedite the learning process. These learning aids include: Numerous illustrations, now presented in full color, and photographs to help visualize what is being presented; Learning objectives; “Why Study . . .” and “Materials of Importance” items that provide rele- vance to topic discussions; Key terms and descriptions of key equations highlighted in the margins for quick reference; End-of-chapter questions and problems;• Answers to selected problems;• A glossary, list of symbols, and references to facilitate understanding the subject matter. The fifth objective is to enhance the teaching and learning process by using the newer technologies that are available to most instructors and students of engineering today. FEATURES THATARENEW TO THISEDITION New/Revised Content Several important changes have been made with this Seventh Edition. One ofthe most significant is the incorporation of a number of new sections, as well1496T_fm_i-xxvi 1/6/06 02:56 Page ixas revisions/amplifications of other sections.

other sections. New sections/discussions are as follows: One-component (or unary) phase diagrams (Section 9.6) Compacted graphite iron (in Section 11.2, “Ferrous Alloys”)• Lost foam casting (in Section 11.5, “Casting”)• Temperature dependence of Frenkel and Schottky defects (in Section 12.5, “Imperfections in Ceramics”) Fractography of ceramics (in Section 12.8, “Brittle Fracture of Ceramics”)• Crystallization of glass-ceramics, in terms of isothermal transformation and continuous cooling transformation diagrams (in Section 13.3, “Glass-Ceramics”) Permeability in polymers (in Section 14.14, “Diffusion in Polymeric Materials”) Magnetic anisotropy (Section 20.8) A new case study on chemical protective clothing (Sections 22.13 and 22.14). Those sections that have been revised/amplified, include the following: Treatments in Chapter 1 (“Introduction”) on the several material types have been enlarged to include comparisons of various property values (as bar charts). Expanded discussions on crystallographic directions and planes in hexagonal crystals (Sections 3.9 and 3.10); also some new related homework problems. Comparisons of (1) dimensional size ranges for various structural elements, and (2) resolution ranges for the several microscopic examination tech-niques (in Section 4.10, “Microscopic Techniques”). Updates on hardness testing techniques (Section 6.10). Revised discussion on the Burgers vector (Section 7.4).• New discussion on why recrystallization temperature depends on the purity of a metal (Section 7.12). Eliminated some detailed discussion on fracture mechanics—i.e., used “Concise Version” from sixth edition (Section 8.5).

(Section 8.5). Expanded discussion on nondestructive testing (Section 8.5).• Used Concise Version (from sixth edition) of discussion on crack initiation and propagation (for fatigue, Section 8.9), and eliminated section on crack propagation rate. Refined terminology and representations of polymer structures (Sections 14.3 through 14.8). Eliminated discussion on fringed-micelle model (found in Section 14.12 of the sixth edition). Enhanced discussion on defects in polymers (Section 14.13). Revised the following sections in Chapter 15 (“Characteristics, Applica- tions, and Processing of Polymers”): fracture of polymers (Section 15.5), deformation of semicrystalline polymers (Section 15.7), adhesives (inSection 15.18), polymerization (Section 15.20), and fabrication of fibers andfilms (Section 15.24). Revised treatment of polymer degradation (Section 17.12).x•Preface 1496T_fm_i-xxvi 01/10/06 22:13 Page xMaterials of Importance One new feature that has been incorporated in this edition is “Materials of Im- portance” pieces; in these we discuss familiar and interesting materials/applicationsof materials. These pieces lend some relevance to topical coverage, are found inmost chapters in the book, and include the following: Carbonated Beverage Containers Water (Its Volume Expansion Upon Freezing)• Tin (Its Allotropic Transformation)• Catalysts (and Surface Defects)• Aluminum for Integrated Circuit Interconnects• Lead-Free Solders• Shape-Memory Alloys• Metal Alloys Used for Euro Coins• Carbon Nanotubes• Piezoelectric Ceramics• Shrink-Wrap Polymer Films• Phenolic Billiard Balls• Nanocomposites in Tennis Balls• Aluminum Electrical Wires• Invar and Other Low-Expansion Alloys• An Iron-Silicon Alloy That is Used in Transformer Cores• Light-Emitting Diodes Concept Check Another new feature included in this seventh edition is what we call a “Concept Check,” a question that tests whether or not a student understands the subject mat-ter on a conceptual level.

conceptual level. Concept check questions are found within most chap-ters; many of them appeared in the end-of-chapter Questions and Problems sectionsof the previous edition. Answers to these questions are on the book’s Web site,www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site). And, finally, for each chapter, both the Summary and the Questions and Prob- lems are organized by section; section titles precede their summaries and ques-tions/problems. Format Changes There are several other major changes from the format of the sixth edition. First ofall, no CD-ROM is packaged with the in-print text; all electronic components arefound on the book’s Web site (www.wiley.com/college/callister ). This includes the last five chapters in the book—viz.

Transportation, housing, clothing, communication, recreation, and food production—virtually every segment of our everyday lives is influenced to one degree or anotherby materials. Historically, the development and advancement of societies have beenintimately tied to the members’ ability to produce and manipulate materials to filltheir needs. In fact, early civilizations have been designated by the level of theirmaterials development (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age). 1 The earliest humans had access to only a very limited number of materials, those that occur naturally: stone, wood, clay, skins, and so on. With time they dis-covered techniques for producing materials that had properties superior to thoseof the natural ones; these new materials included pottery and various metals. Fur-thermore, it was discovered that the properties of a material could be altered byheat treatments and by the addition of other substances. At this point, materials uti-lization was totally a selection process that involved deciding from a given, ratherlimited set of materials the one best suited for an application by virtue of its char-acteristics. It was not until relatively recent times that scientists came to understandthe relationships between the structural elements of materials and their properties.This knowledge, acquired over approximately the past 100 years, has empoweredthem to fashion, to a large degree, the characteristics of materials.Thus, tens of thou-sands of different materials have evolved with rather specialized characteristics thatmeet the needs of our modern and complex society; these include metals, plastics,glasses, and fibers.

and fibers. The development of many technologies that make our existence so comfort- able has been intimately associated with the accessibility of suitable materials.An advancement in the understanding of a material type is often the forerun-ner to the stepwise progression of a technology. For example, automobileswould not have been possible without the availability of inexpensive steel orsome other comparable substitute. In our contemporary era, sophisticated elec-tronic devices rely on components that are made from what are called semicon-ducting materials.Learning Objectives After careful study of this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1.List six different property classifications of materials that determine their applicability. 2.Cite the four components that are involved in the design, production, and utilization ofmaterials, and briefly describe the interrelation-ships between these components. 3.Cite three criteria that are important in the ma- terials selection process.4. (a) List the three primary classifications of solid materials, and then cite the distinctive chemical feature of each. (b) Note the two types of advanced materials and, for each, its distinctive feature(s). 5. (a) Briefly define “smart material/system.”(b) Briefly explain the concept of “nanotech- nology” as it applies to materials. 1The approximate dates for the beginnings of Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages were 2.5 million BC, 3500 BCand 1000 BC, respectively.1496T_c01_01-14 12/20/05 7:11 Page 22nd REVISE PAGES1.2 Materials Science and Engineering •3 2Throughout this text we draw attention to the relationships between material properties and structural elements.1.2 MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING Sometimes it is useful to subdivide the discipline of materials science and engi- neering into materials science and materials engineering subdisciplines. Strictly speaking, “materials science” involves investigating the relationships that existbetween the structures and properties of materials.

of materials. In contrast, “materials engi-neering” is, on the basis of these structure–property correlations, designing or en-gineering the structure of a material to produce a predetermined set of properties. 2 From a functional perspective, the role of a materials scientist is to develop or syn-thesize new materials, whereas a materials engineer is called upon to create newproducts or systems using existing materials, and/or to develop techniques for pro-cessing materials. Most graduates in materials programs are trained to be bothmaterials scientists and materials engineers. “Structure” is at this point a nebulous term that deserves some explanation. In brief, the structure of a material usually relates to the arrangement of its internalcomponents. Subatomic structure involves electrons within the individual atoms andinteractions with their nuclei. On an atomic level, structure encompasses the or-ganization of atoms or molecules relative to one another. The next larger structuralrealm, which contains large groups of atoms that are normally agglomerated to-gether, is termed “microscopic,” meaning that which is subject to direct observationusing some type of microscope. Finally, structural elements that may be viewed withthe naked eye are termed “macroscopic.” The notion of “property” deserves elaboration. While in service use, all mate- rials are exposed to external stimuli that evoke some type of response. For exam-ple, a specimen subjected to forces will experience deformation, or a polished metalsurface will reflect light. A property is a material trait in terms of the kind and mag-nitude of response to a specific imposed stimulus. Generally, definitions of proper-ties are made independent of material shape and size. Virtually all important properties of solid materials may be grouped into six dif- ferent categories: mechanical, electrical, thermal, magnetic, optical, and deteriorative.For each there is a characteristic type of stimulus capable of provoking different re-sponses.

different re-sponses. Mechanical properties relate deformation to an applied load or force; exam-ples include elastic modulus and strength. For electrical properties, such as electricalconductivity and dielectric constant, the stimulus is an electric field. The thermal be-havior of solids can be represented in terms of heat capacity and thermal conductiv-ity. Magnetic properties demonstrate the response of a material to the application ofa magnetic field. For optical properties, the stimulus is electromagnetic or light radia-tion; index of refraction and reflectivity are representative optical properties. Finally,deteriorative characteristics relate to the chemical reactivity of materials. The chaptersthat follow discuss properties that fall within each of these six classifications. In addition to structure and properties, two other important components are involved in the science and engineering of materials—namely, “processing” and“performance.”With regard to the relationships of these four components, the struc-ture of a material will depend on how it is processed. Furthermore, a material’s per-formance will be a function of its properties. Thus, the interrelationship betweenprocessing, structure, properties, and performance is as depicted in the schematicillustration shown in Figure 1.1. Throughout this text we draw attention to the1496T_c01_01-14 11/9/05 17:02 Page 3REVISED PAGESrelationships among these four components in terms of the design, production, and utilization of materials. We now present an example of these processing-structure-properties-performance principles with Figure 1.2, a photograph showing three thin disk specimens placedover some printed matter. It is obvious that the optical properties (i.e., the lighttransmittance) of each of the three materials are different; the one on the left is trans-parent (i.e., virtually all of the reflected light passes through it), whereas the disks in the center and on the right are, respectively, translucent and opaque.All of these spec-imens are of the same material, aluminum oxide, but the leftmost one is what we calla single crystal—that is, it is highly perfect—which gives rise to its transparency.

its transparency. Thecenter one is composed of numerous and very small single crystals that are all con-nected; the boundaries between these small crystals scatter a portion of the light re-flected from the printed page, which makes this material optically translucent. Finally,the specimen on the right is composed not only of many small, interconnected crys-tals, but also of a large number of very small pores or void spaces. These pores alsoeffectively scatter the reflected light and render this material opaque. Thus, the structures of these three specimens are different in terms of crystal boundaries and pores, which affect the optical transmittance properties. Further-more, each material was produced using a different processing technique. And, ofcourse, if optical transmittance is an important parameter relative to the ultimatein-service application, the performance of each material will be different.4•Chapter 1 / Introduction Figure 1.2 Photograph of three thin disk specimens of aluminum oxide, which have been placed over a printed page in order to demonstrate their differences in light-transmittance characteristics. The disk on the left is transparent (that is, virtually all light that is reflectedfrom the page passes through it), whereas the one in the center is translucent (meaning thatsome of this reflected light is transmitted through the disk). And, the disk on the right isopaque—i.e., none of the light passes through it. These differences in optical properties are aconsequence of differences in structure of these materials, which have resulted from the waythe materials were processed. (Specimen preparation, P . A.

AND ENGINEERING? Why do we study materials? Many an applied scientist or engineer, whether me- chanical, civil, chemical, or electrical, will at one time or another be exposed to adesign problem involving materials. Examples might include a transmission gear,the superstructure for a building, an oil refinery component, or an integrated circuitchip. Of course, materials scientists and engineers are specialists who are totallyinvolved in the investigation and design of materials. Many times, a materials problem is one of selecting the right material from the many thousands that are available. There are several criteria on which the finaldecision is normally based. First of all, the in-service conditions must be character-ized, for these will dictate the properties required of the material. On only rareoccasions does a material possess the maximum or ideal combination of properties.Thus, it may be necessary to trade off one characteristic for another. The classic ex-ample involves strength and ductility; normally, a material having a high strengthwill have only a limited ductility. In such cases a reasonable compromise betweentwo or more properties may be necessary. A second selection consideration is any deterioration of material properties that may occur during service operation. For example, significant reductions in mechanicalstrength may result from exposure to elevated temperatures or corrosive environments. Finally, probably the overriding consideration is that of economics: What will the finished product cost? A material may be found that has the ideal set of prop-erties but is prohibitively expensive. Here again, some compromise is inevitable.The cost of a finished piece also includes any expense incurred during fabricationto produce the desired shape. The more familiar an engineer or scientist is with the various characteristics and structure–property relationships, as well as processing techniques of materials,the more proficient and confident he or she will be to make judicious materialschoices based on these criteria. 1.4 CLASSIFICATION OF MATERIALS Solid materials have been conveniently grouped into three basic classifications: met-als, ceramics, and polymers.This scheme is based primarily on chemical makeup andatomic structure, and most materials fall into one distinct grouping or another,although there are some intermediates.

some intermediates. In addition, there are the composites, com-binations of two or more of the above three basic material classes. A brief explana-tion of these material types and representative characteristics is offered next. Another classification is advanced materials—those used in high-technology applications—viz. semiconductors, biomaterials, smart materials, and nanoengineered materials;these are discussed in Section 1.5. Metals Materials in this group are composed of one or more metallic elements (such as iron,aluminum, copper, titanium, gold, and nickel), and often also nonmetallic elements (forexample, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen) in relatively small amounts. 3Atoms in metals and their alloys are arranged in a very orderly manner (as discussed in Chapter 3),and in comparison to the ceramics and polymers, are relatively dense (Figure 1.3).With1.4 Classification of Materials •5 3The term metal alloy is used in reference to a metallic substance that is composed of two or more elements.1496T_c01_01-14 11/9/05 17:02 Page 5REVISED PAGES6•Chapter 1 / Introduction Density (g/cm3) (logarithmic scale)40 20 10 8 6 4 2 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.20.4 0.1Metals Platinum Silver Copper Iron/Steel Titanium Aluminum MagnesiumComposites GFRC CFRC WoodsPolymers PTFE PVC PS PE RubberZrO2 Al2O3 SiC,Si3N4 Glass ConcreteCeramicsFigure 1.3 Bar-chart of room- temperature density values for various metals, ceramics, polymers, and composite materials.

Metallic materials have large numbers ofnonlocalized electrons; that is, these electrons are not bound to particular atoms. Manyproperties of metals are directly attributable to these electrons. For example, metalsare extremely good conductors of electricity (Figure 1.7) and heat, and are not trans-parent to visible light; a polished metal surface has a lustrous appearance. In addi-tion, some of the metals (viz., Fe, Co, and Ni) have desirable magnetic properties. Figure 1.8 is a photograph that shows several common and familiar objects that are made of metallic materials. Furthermore, the types and applications of metalsand their alloys are discussed in Chapter 11. Ceramics Ceramics are compounds between metallic and nonmetallic elements; they are mostfrequently oxides, nitrides, and carbides. For example, some of the common ceramic1496T_c01_01-14 11/9/05 17:02 Page 6REVISED PAGESmaterials include aluminum oxide (or alumina,Al 2O3), silicon dioxide (or silica, SiO 2), silicon carbide (SiC), silicon nitride (Si 3N4), and, in addition, what some refer to as thetraditional ceramics—those composed of clay minerals (i.e., porcelain), as well as cement, and glass.

and glass. With regard to mechanical behavior, ceramic materials are rela- tively stiff and strong—stiffnesses and strengths are comparable to those of the met-als (Figures 1.4 and 1.5). In addition, ceramics are typically very hard. On the otherhand, they are extremely brittle (lack ductility), and are highly susceptible to fracture(Figure 1.6). These materials are typically insulative to the passage of heat and elec-tricity (i.e., have low electrical conductivities, Figure 1.7), and are more resistant tohigh temperatures and harsh environments than metals and polymers. With regard tooptical characteristics, ceramics may be transparent, translucent, or opaque (Figure1.2), and some of the oxide ceramics (e.g., Fe 3O4) exhibit magnetic behavior.1.4 Classification of Materials •7 Strength (Tensile Strength, in units of megapascals) (logarithmic scale)1000 100 10Nylon PS PEPVC PTFEPolymersSteel alloys GoldAluminumalloysCu,Ti alloysMetals CFRC GFRCComposites WoodsGlassSi3N4 SiCCeramics Al2O3Figure 1.5 Bar-chart of room- temperature strength (i.e., tensile strength) values for various metals, ceramics, polymers, and composite materials.

Many of them are organiccompounds that are chemically based on carbon, hydrogen, and other nonmetallicelements (viz. O, N, and Si). Furthermore, they have very large molecular structures,often chain-like in nature that have a backbone of carbon atoms. Some of the com-mon and familiar polymers are polyethylene (PE), nylon, poly(vinyl chloride)(PVC), polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), and silicone rubber. These materialstypically have low densities (Figure 1.3), whereas their mechanical characteristicsare generally dissimilar to the metallic and ceramic materials—they are not as stiffnor as strong as these other material types (Figures 1.4 and 1.5).

complex shapes. In general, they are relatively inert chemically and unreactivein a large number of environments. One major drawback to the polymers is theirtendency to soften and/or decompose at modest temperatures, which, in some in-stances, limits their use. Furthermore, they have low electrical conductivities (Fig-ure 1.7) and are nonmagnetic. The photograph in Figure 1.10 shows several articles made of polymers that are familiar to the reader. Chapters 14 and 15 are devoted to discussions of the struc-tures, properties, applications, and processing of polymeric materials.1.4 Classification of Materials •9 Figure 1.9 Common objectsthat are made ofceramic materials:scissors, a china teacup, a building brick,a floor tile, and aglass vase.

The materialused for this application must satisfy the follow-ing constraints: (1) provide a barrier to the pas-sage of carbon dioxide, which is under pressure inthe container; (2) be nontoxic, unreactive with thebeverage, and, preferably be recyclable; (3) be rel-atively strong, and capable of surviving a dropfrom a height of several feet when containing thebeverage; (4) be inexpensive and the cost to fab-ricate the final shape should be relatively low;(5) if optically transparent, retain its optical clar-ity; and (6) capable of being produced havingdifferent colors and/or able to be adorned withdecorative labels.

withdecorative labels. All three of the basic material types—metal (aluminum), ceramic (glass), and polymer (poly-ester plastic)—are used for carbonated beveragecontainers (per the chapter-opening photographsfor this chapter).All of these materials are nontoxicand unreactive with beverages. In addition, eachmaterial has its pros and cons. For example, thealuminum alloy is relatively strong (but easilydented), is a very good barrier to the diffusion ofcarbon dioxide, is easily recycled, beverages arecooled rapidly, and labels may be painted onto itssurface. On the other hand, the cans are opticallyopaque, and relatively expensive to produce. Glassis impervious to the passage of carbon dioxide, isa relatively inexpensive material, may be recycled,but it cracks and fractures easily, and glass bottlesare relatively heavy. Whereas the plastic is rela-tively strong, may be made optically transparent,is inexpensive and lightweight, and is recyclable, itis not as impervious to the passage of carbon diox-ide as the aluminum and glass. For example, youmay have noticed that beverages in aluminum andglass containers retain their carbonization (i.e.,“fizz”) for several years, whereas those in two-literplastic bottles “go flat” within a few months. 4Fiberglass is sometimes also termed a “glass fiber-reinforced polymer” composite, abbrevi- ated “GFRP .”Composites A composite is composed of two (or more) individual materials, which come fromthe categories discussed above—viz., metals, ceramics, and polymers.The design goalof a composite is to achieve a combination of properties that is not displayed byany single material, and also to incorporate the best characteristics of each of thecomponent materials. A large number of composite types exist that are representedby different combinations of metals, ceramics, and polymers.

and polymers. Furthermore, somenaturally-occurring materials are also considered to be composites—for example,wood and bone. However, most of those we consider in our discussions are syn-thetic (or man-made) composites. One of the most common and familiar composites is fiberglass, in which small glass fibers are embedded within a polymeric material (normally an epoxy orpolyester). 4The glass fibers are relatively strong and stiff (but also brittle), whereas the polymer is ductile (but also weak and flexible). Thus, the resulting fiberglass isrelatively stiff, strong, (Figures 1.4 and 1.5) flexible, and ductile. In addition, it hasa low density (Figure 1.3). Another of these technologically important materials is the “carbon fiber- reinforced polymer” (or “CFRP”) composite—carbon fibers that are embedded withina polymer. These materials are stiffer and stronger than the glass fiber-reinforcedmaterials (Figures 1.4 and 1.5), yet they are more expensive. The CFRP composites1496T_c01_01-14 11/9/05 17:02 Page 10REVISED PAGES1.5 Advanced Materials •11 are used in some aircraft and aerospace applications, as well as high-tech sporting equipment (e.g., bicycles, golf clubs, tennis rackets, and skis/snowboards). Chapter 16is devoted to a discussion of these interesting materials. 1.5 ADVANCED MATERIALS Materials that are utilized in high-technology (or high-tech) applications are some-times termed advanced materials. By high technology we mean a device or product that operates or functions using relatively intricate and sophisticated principles; ex-amples include electronic equipment (camcorders, CD/DVD players, etc. ), com-puters, fiber-optic systems, spacecraft, aircraft, and military rocketry.These advancedmaterials are typically traditional materials whose properties have been enhanced,and, also newly developed, high-performance materials.

high-performance materials. Furthermore, they may beof all material types (e.g., metals, ceramics, polymers), and are normally expensive.Advanced materials include semiconductors, biomaterials, and what we may term“materials of the future” (that is, smart materials and nanoengineered materials),which we discuss below. The properties and applications of a number of theseadvanced materials—for example, materials that are used for lasers, integratedcircuits, magnetic information storage, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and fiberoptics—are also discussed in subsequent chapters. Semiconductors Semiconductors have electrical properties that are intermediate between the elec-trical conductors (viz. metals and metal alloys) and insulators (viz. ceramics andpolymers)—Figure 1.7. Furthermore, the electrical characteristics of these materi-als are extremely sensitive to the presence of minute concentrations of impurityatoms, for which the concentrations may be controlled over very small spatial re-gions. Semiconductors have made possible the advent of integrated circuitry thathas totally revolutionized the electronics and computer industries (not to mentionour lives) over the past three decades. Biomaterials Biomaterials are employed in components implanted into the human body forreplacement of diseased or damaged body parts. These materials must not producetoxic substances and must be compatible with body tissues (i.e., must not causeadverse biological reactions). All of the above materials—metals, ceramics, poly-mers, composites, and semiconductors—may be used as biomaterials. For example,some of the biomaterials that are utilized in artificial hip replacements are dis-cussed in Section 22.12. Materials of the Future Smart Materials Smart (or intelligent ) materials are a group of new and state-of-the-art materials now being developed that will have a significant influence on many of our tech- nologies.The adjective “smart” implies that these materials are able to sense changesin their environments and then respond to these changes in predetermined manners— traits that are also found in living organisms.

living organisms. In addition, this “smart” concept is be-ing extended to rather sophisticated systems that consist of both smart and tra-ditional materials. Components of a smart material (or system) include some type of sensor (that detects an input signal), and an actuator (that performs a responsive and adaptive1496T_c01_01-14 11/9/05 17:02 Page 11REVISED PAGESfunction). Actuators may be called upon to change shape, position, natural frequency, or mechanical characteristics in response to changes in temperature,electric fields, and/or magnetic fields. Four types of materials are commonly used for actuators: shape memory alloys, piezoelectric ceramics, magnetostrictive materials, and electrorheological/magne-torheological fluids. Shape memory alloys are metals that, after having been deformed,revert back to their original shapes when temperature is changed (see the Materi-als of Importance piece following Section 10.9). Piezoelectric ceramics expand andcontract in response to an applied electric field (or voltage); conversely, they alsogenerate an electric field when their dimensions are altered (see Section 18.25). Thebehavior of magnetostrictive materials is analogous to that of the piezoelectrics, ex-cept that they are responsive to magnetic fields. Also, electrorheological and mag-netorheological fluids are liquids that experience dramatic changes in viscosity uponthe application of electric and magnetic fields, respectively. Materials/devices employed as sensors include optical fibers (Section 21.14), piezoelectric materials (including some polymers), and microelectromechanicaldevices (MEMS, Section 13.8). For example, one type of smart system is used in helicopters to reduce aero- dynamic cockpit noise that is created by the rotating rotor blades. Piezoelectricsensors inserted into the blades monitor blade stresses and deformations; feedbacksignals from these sensors are fed into a computer-controlled adaptive device, whichgenerates noise-canceling antinoise.

noise-canceling antinoise. Nanoengineered Materials Until very recent times the general procedure utilized by scientists to understandthe chemistry and physics of materials has been to begin by studying large and com-plex structures, and then to investigate the fundamental building blocks of thesestructures that are smaller and simpler. This approach is sometimes termed “top-down” science. However, with the advent of scanning probe microscopes (Sec-tion 4.10), which permit observation of individual atoms and molecules, it has be-come possible to manipulate and move atoms and molecules to form new structuresand, thus, design new materials that are built from simple atomic-level constituents(i.e., “materials by design”). This ability to carefully arrange atoms provides op-portunities to develop mechanical, electrical, magnetic, and other properties thatare not otherwise possible. We call this the “bottom-up” approach, and the study ofthe properties of these materials is termed “nanotechnology”; the “nano” prefix de-notes that the dimensions of these structural entities are on the order of a nanome-ter (10 /H110029m)—as a rule, less than 100 nanometers (equivalent to approximately 500 atom diameters).5One example of a material of this type is the carbon nanotube, discussed in Section 12.4. In the future we will undoubtedly find that increasinglymore of our technological advances will utilize these nanoengineered materials. 1.6 MODERN MATERIALS’ NEEDS In spite of the tremendous progress that has been made in the discipline of materialsscience and engineering within the past few years, there still remain technologicalchallenges, including the development of even more sophisticated and specialized12 •Chapter 1 / Introduction 5One legendary and prophetic suggestion as to the possibility of nanoengineering materials was offered by Richard Feynman in his 1960 American Physical Society lecture that was entitled “There is Plenty of Room at the Bottom.”1496T_c01_01-14 12/20/05 7:11 Page 122nd REVISE PAGESmaterials, as well as consideration of the environmental impact of materials pro- duction.

pro- duction. Some comment is appropriate relative to these issues so as to round outthis perspective. Nuclear energy holds some promise, but the solutions to the many problems that remain will necessarily involve materials, from fuels to containment structuresto facilities for the disposal of radioactive waste. Significant quantities of energy are involved in transportation. Reducing the weight of transportation vehicles (automobiles, aircraft, trains, etc. ), as well asincreasing engine operating temperatures, will enhance fuel efficiency. New high-strength, low-density structural materials remain to be developed, as well as mate-rials that have higher-temperature capabilities, for use in engine components. Furthermore, there is a recognized need to find new, economical sources of en- ergy and to use present resources more efficiently. Materials will undoubtedly playa significant role in these developments. For example, the direct conversion of so-lar into electrical energy has been demonstrated. Solar cells employ some rathercomplex and expensive materials. To ensure a viable technology, materials that arehighly efficient in this conversion process yet less costly must be developed. The hydrogen fuel cell is another very attractive and feasible energy-conversion technology that has the advantage of being non-polluting. It is just beginning to beimplemented in batteries for electronic devices, and holds promise as the powerplant for automobiles. New materials still need to be developed for more efficientfuel cells, and also for better catalysts to be used in the production of hydrogen. Furthermore, environmental quality depends on our ability to control air and water pollution. Pollution control techniques employ various materials. In addition,materials processing and refinement methods need to be improved so that they pro-duce less environmental degradation—that is, less pollution and less despoilage ofthe landscape from the mining of raw materials. Also, in some materials manufac-turing processes, toxic substances are produced, and the ecological impact of theirdisposal must be considered. Many materials that we use are derived from resources that are nonrenewable— that is, not capable of being regenerated.

being regenerated. These include polymers, for which theprime raw material is oil, and some metals. These nonrenewable resources are grad-ually becoming depleted, which necessitates: (1) the discovery of additional reserves,(2) the development of new materials having comparable properties with less ad-verse environmental impact, and/or (3) increased recycling efforts and the devel-opment of new recycling technologies. As a consequence of the economics of notonly production but also environmental impact and ecological factors, it is becomingincreasingly important to consider the “cradle-to-grave” life cycle of materials rel-ative to the overall manufacturing process. The roles that materials scientists and engineers play relative to these, as well as other environmental and societal issues, are discussed in more detail in Chapter 23.

a gecko. Geckos, harmless tropical lizards, are extremel y fascinating and extraordinary animals. They have very sticky feet that cling to virtually any surface. This characteristic makes it possible for them to rapidly run up vertical walls and along the undersides of horizontal surfaces. In fact, agecko can support its body mass with a single toe! The secret to this remarkable ability is the pres-ence of an extremely large number of microscopically small hairs on each of their toe pads. Whenthese hairs come in contact with a surface, weak forces of attraction (i.e., van der Waals forces)are established between hair molecules and molecules on the surface. The fact that these hairs areso small and so numerous explains why the gecko grips surfaces so tightly. To release its grip, thegecko simply curls up its toes, and peels the hairs away from the surface. Another interesting feature of these toe pads is that they are self-cleaning—that is, dirt parti- cles don’t stick to them. Scientists are just beginning to understand the mechanism of adhesion forthese tiny hairs, which may lead to the development of synthetic self-cleaning adhesives. Can youimage duct tape that never looses its stickiness, or bandages that never leave a sticky residue? (Photograph courtesy of Professor Kellar Autumn, Lewis & Clark College, Portland, Oregon.) An important reason to have an understanding of in- teratomic bonding in solids is that, in some instances,the type of bond allows us to explain a material’sproperties. For example, consider carbon, which mayexist as both graphite and diamond. Whereas graphiteis relatively soft and has a “greasy” feel to it, diamondis the hardest known material. This dramatic disparityin properties is directly attributable to a type of inter-atomic bonding found in graphite that does not existin diamond (see Section 12.4).WHY STUDY Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding ?1496T_c02_15-37 12/20/05 7:19 Page 152nd REVISE PAGES2.1 INTRODUCTION Some of the important properties of solid materials depend on geometrical atomic arrangements, and also the interactions that exist among constituent atoms or mol-ecules.

or mol-ecules. This chapter, by way of preparation for subsequent discussions, considersseveral fundamental and important concepts—namely, atomic structure, electronconfigurations in atoms and the periodic table, and the various types of primaryand secondary interatomic bonds that hold together the atoms comprising a solid.These topics are reviewed briefly, under the assumption that some of the materialis familiar to the reader. Atomic Structure 2.2 FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS Each atom consists of a very small nucleus composed of protons and neutrons, whichis encircled by moving electrons. Both electrons and protons are electrically charged,the charge magnitude being which is negative in sign for electrons and positive for protons; neutrons are electrically neutral. Masses for these sub-atomic particles are infinitesimally small; protons and neutrons have approximatelythe same mass, which is significantly larger than that of an elec- tron, Each chemical element is characterized by the number of protons in the nu- cleus, or the atomic number (Z). 1For an electrically neutral or complete atom, the atomic number also equals the number of electrons. This atomic number ranges inintegral units from 1 for hydrogen to 92 for uranium, the highest of the naturallyoccurring elements. The atomic mass (A) of a specific atom may be expressed as the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons within the nucleus.Although the number of protonsis the same for all atoms of a given element, the number of neutrons ( N) may be variable. Thus atoms of some elements have two or more different atomic masses,which are called isotopes. The atomic weight of an element corresponds to the weighted average of the atomic masses of the atom’s naturally occurring isotopes. 2 The atomic mass unit (amu) may be used for computations of atomic weight.

However, atomic weight is, by conven- tion, the preferred terminology and will be used throughout this book. The reader shouldnote that it is not necessary to divide molecular weight by the gravitational constant.atomic number isotope atomic weight atomic mass unit1496T_c02_15-37 12/20/05 7:19 Page 162nd REVISE PAGESscale has been established whereby 1 amu is defined as of the atomic mass of the most common isotope of carbon, carbon Within this scheme, the masses of protons and neutrons are slightly greater than unity, and (2.1) The atomic weight of an element or the molecular weight of a compound may bespecified on the basis of amu per atom (molecule) or mass per mole of material.In one mole of a substance there are (Avogadro’s number) atoms or molecules. These two atomic weight schemes are related through the followingequation: For example, the atomic weight of iron is 55.85 amu/atom, or 55.85 g/mol. Sometimes use of amu per atom or molecule is convenient; on other occasions g (or kg)/molis preferred.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 2.3 ELECTRONS IN ATOMS Atomic Models During the latter part of the nineteenth century it was realized that many phe-nomena involving electrons in solids could not be explained in terms of classicalmechanics. What followed was the establishment of a set of principles and laws thatgovern systems of atomic and subatomic entities that came to be known as quantum mechanics. An understanding of the behavior of electrons in atoms and crystalline solids necessarily involves the discussion of quantum-mechanical concepts. How-ever, a detailed exploration of these principles is beyond the scope of this book,and only a very superficial and simplified treatment is given. One early outgrowth of quantum mechanics was the simplified Bohr atomic model, in which electrons are assumed to revolve around the atomic nucleus in discrete orbitals, and the position of any particular electron is more orless well defined in terms of its orbital. This model of the atom is represented inFigure 2.1. Another important quantum-mechanical principle stipulates that the energies of electrons are quantized; that is, electrons are permitted to have only specific val-ues of energy. An electron may change energy, but in doing so it must make a quan-tum jump either to an allowed higher energy (with absorption of energy) or to alower energy (with emission of energy). Often, it is convenient to think of these al-lowed electron energies as being associated with energy levels or states. These states do not vary continuously with energy; that is, adjacent states are separated by finiteenergies. For example, allowed states for the Bohr hydrogen atom are representedin Figure 2.2a. These energies are taken to be negative, whereas the zero referenceis the unbound or free electron.

free electron. Of course, the single electron associated with thehydrogen atom will fill only one of these states.1 amu/atom 1or molecule 2/H110051 g/mol6.023 /H110031023A/H11061Z/H11001N12 112C2 1A/H1100512.00000 2.1 122.3 Electrons in Atoms •17 quantum mechanics Bohr atomic modelmole1496T_c02_15-37 11/10/05 10:42 Page 17REVISED PAGESThus, the Bohr model represents an early attempt to describe electrons in atoms, in terms of both position (electron orbitals) and energy (quantized energy levels). This Bohr model was eventually found to have some significant limitations because of its inability to explain several phenomena involving electrons. Aresolution was reached with a wave-mechanical model, in which the electron is considered to exhibit both wave-like and particle-like characteristics. With thismodel, an electron is no longer treated as a particle moving in a discrete or-bital; rather, position is considered to be the probability of an electron’s being atvarious locations around the nucleus. In other words, position is described by aprobability distribution or electron cloud. Figure 2.3 compares Bohr and wave-mechanical models for the hydrogen atom. Both these models are used through-out the course of this book; the choice depends on which model allows the moresimple explanation.18 •Chapter 2 / Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding Orbital electron Nucleus Figure 2.2 (a) The first three electron energy states for theBohr hydrogen atom.

The size, shape, and spatial orientation of an electron’s probability density are specified by three of these quantum numbers. Furthermore,Bohr energy levels separate into electron subshells, and quantum numbers dictate thenumber of states within each subshell. Shells are specified by a principal quantum number n, which may take on integral values beginning with unity; sometimes theseshells are designated by the letters K,L,M,N,O, and so on, which correspond, respectively, to as indicated in Table 2.1. Note also that this quan- tum number, and it only, is also associated with the Bohr model. This quantum num-ber is related to the distance of an electron from the nucleus, or its position. The second quantum number, l, signifies the subshell, which is denoted by a lowercase letter—an s, p,d,o rf; it is related to the shape of the electron subshell. In addition, the number of these subshells is restricted by the magnitude of n. Allowable subshells for the several nvalues are also presented in Table 2.1.

Table 2.1. The number of energy states for each subshell is determined by the third quantum num-ber, For an ssubshell, there is a single energy state, whereas for p,d, and fsub- shells, three, five, and seven states exist, respectively (Table 2.1). In the absence ofan external magnetic field, the states within each subshell are identical. However,when a magnetic field is applied these subshell states split, each state assuming aslightly different energy.m l.n/H110051, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . ,2.3 Electrons in Atoms •19 1.0 0 (a) (b)Orbital electron NucleusProbability Distance from nucleusFigure 2.3 Comparison of the (a) Bohr and ( b) wave- mechanical atom models in terms of electrondistribution.

Related to this spin moment is the fourth quantum number, for which two values are possible ( and ), one for each of the spin orientations. Thus, the Bohr model was further refined by wave mechanics, in which the in- troduction of three new quantum numbers gives rise to electron subshells withineach shell. A comparison of these two models on this basis is illustrated, for thehydrogen atom, in Figures 2.2 aand 2.2b. A complete energy level diagram for the various shells and subshells using the wave-mechanical model is shown in Figure 2.4.

Figure 2.4. Several features of the diagram areworth noting. First, the smaller the principal quantum number, the lower the energylevel; for example, the energy of a 1 sstate is less than that of a 2s state, which in turn is lower than the 3s . Second, within each shell, the energy of a subshell level in- creases with the value of the l quantum number. For example, the energy of a 3 d state is greater than a 3 p, which is larger than 3 s.

Electron Configurations The preceding discussion has dealt primarily with electron states—values of energy that are permitted for electrons.To determine the manner in which these states are filledwith electrons, we use the Pauli exclusion principle, another quantum-mechanical concept.

quantum-mechanical concept. This principle stipulates that each electron state can hold no more than twoelectrons, which must have opposite spins. Thus, s,p,d, and fsubshells may each ac- commodate, respectively, a total of 2, 6, 10, and 14 electrons; Table 2.1 summarizes themaximum number of electrons that may occupy each of the first four shells. Of course, not all possible states in an atom are filled with electrons. For most atoms, the electrons fill up the lowest possible energy states in the electron shells andsubshells, two electrons (having opposite spins) per state. The energy structure for asodium atom is represented schematically in Figure 2.5. When all the electrons oc-cupy the lowest possible energies in accord with the foregoing restrictions, an atomis said to be in its ground state. However, electron transitions to higher energy states are possible, as discussed in Chapters 18 and 21. The electron configuration or struc- ture of an atom represents the manner in which these states are occupied. In theconventional notation the number of electrons in each subshell is indicated by a su-perscript after the shell–subshell designation. For example, the electron configurationsfor hydrogen, helium, and sodium are, respectively, 1 s 1,1s2, and 1s22s22p63s1. Electron configurations for some of the more common elements are listed in Table 2.2. At this point, comments regarding these electron configurations are necessary. First, the valence electrons are those that occupy the outermost shell. These elec- trons are extremely important; as will be seen, they participate in the bonding be-tween atoms to form atomic and molecular aggregates. Furthermore, many of thephysical and chemical properties of solids are based on these valence electrons. In addition, some atoms have what are termed “stable electron configurations”; that is, the states within the outermost or valence electron shell are completelyfilled.

are completelyfilled. Normally this corresponds to the occupation of just the s and pstates for the outermost shell by a total of eight electrons, as in neon, argon, and krypton;one exception is helium, which contains only two 1s electrons. These elements (Ne, Ar, Kr, and He) are the inert, or noble, gases, which are virtually unreactivechemically. Some atoms of the elements that have unfilled valence shells assumestable electron configurations by gaining or losing electrons to form charged ions,2.3 Electrons in Atoms •21Increasing energy3p 3s 2s 1s2pFigure 2.5 Schematic representation of the filled and lowest unfilled energy states for a sodium atom.electron state valence electronPauli exclusion principle ground state electron configuration1496T_c02_15-37 11/10/05 13:32 Page 21REVISED PAGESor by sharing electrons with other atoms. This is the basis for some chemical reactions, and also for atomic bonding in solids, as explained in Section 2.6. Under special circumstances, the s and porbitals combine to form hybrid spnorbitals, where nindicates the number of porbitals involved, which may have a value of 1, 2, or 3. The 3A, 4A, and 5A group elements of the periodic table(Figure 2.6) are those that most often form these hybrids. The driving force for theformation of hybrid orbitals is a lower energy state for the valence electrons. Forcarbon the sp 3hybrid is of primary importance in organic and polymer chemistries. The shape of the sp3hybrid is what determines the (or tetrahedral) angle found in polymer chains (Chapter 14).109/H1103422 •Chapter 2 / Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding Table 2.2 A Listing of the Expected Electron Configurations for Some of the Common Elementsa Atomic Element Symbol Number Electron Configuration Hydrogen H 1 1s1 Helium He 2 1s2 Lithium Li 3 1s22s1 Beryllium Be 4 1s22s2 Boron B 5 1s22s22p1 Carbon C 6 1s22s22p2 Nitrogen N 7 1s22s22p3 Oxygen O 8 1s22s22p4 Fluorine F 9 1s22s22p5 Neon Ne 10 1s22s22p6 Sodium Na 11 1s22s22p63s1 Magnesium Mg 12 1s22s22p63s2 Aluminum Al 13 1s22s22p63s23p1 Silicon Si 14 1s22s22p63s23p2 Phosphorus P 15 1s22s22p63s23p3 Sulfur S 16 1s22s22p63s23p4 Chlorine Cl 17 1s22s22p63s23p5 Argon Ar 18 1s22s22p63s23p6 Potassium K 19 1s22s22p63s23p64s1 Calcium Ca 20 1s22s22p63s23p64s2 Scandium Sc 21 1s22s22p63s23p63d14s2 Titanium Ti 22 1s22s22p63s23p63d24s2 Vanadium V 23 1s22s22p63s23p63d34s2 Chromium Cr 24 1s22s22p63s23p63d54s1 Manganese Mn 25 1s22s22p63s23p63d54s2 Iron Fe 26 1s22s22p63s23p63d64s2 Cobalt Co 27 1s22s22p63s23p63d74s2 Nickel Ni 28 1s22s22p63s23p63d84s2 Copper Cu 29 1s22s22p63s23p63d104s1 Zinc Zn 30 1s22s22p63s23p63d104s2 Gallium Ga 31 1s22s22p63s23p63d104s24p1 Germanium Ge 32 1s22s22p63s23p63d104s24p2 Arsenic As 33 1s22s22p63s23p63d104s24p3 Selenium Se 34 1s22s22p63s23p63d104s24p4 Bromine Br 35 1s22s22p63s23p63d104s24p5 Krypton Kr 36 1s22s22p63s23p63d104s24p6 aWhen some elements covalently bond, they form sphybrid bonds.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 2.4 THE PERIODIC TABLE All the elements have been classified according to electron configuration in the periodic table (Figure 2.6). Here, the elements are situated, with increasing atomic number, in seven horizontal rows called periods. The arrangement is such that allelements arrayed in a given column or group have similar valence electron struc-tures, as well as chemical and physical properties. These properties change gradu-ally, moving horizontally across each period and vertically down each column. The elements positioned in Group 0, the rightmost group, are the inert gases, which have filled electron shells and stable electron configurations. Group VIIA andVIA elements are one and two electrons deficient, respectively, from having stablestructures. The Group VIIA elements (F, Cl, Br, I, and At) are sometimes termedthe halogens. The alkali and the alkaline earth metals (Li, Na, K, Be, Mg, Ca, etc. )are labeled as Groups IA and IIA, having, respectively, one and two electrons in ex-cess of stable structures.The elements in the three long periods, Groups IIIB throughIIB, are termed the transition metals, which have partially filled delectron states and in some cases one or two electrons in the next higher energy shell. Groups IIIA,IVA, and VA (B, Si, Ge, As, etc.) display characteristics that are intermediate be-tween the metals and nonmetals by virtue of their valence electron structures.2.4 The Periodic Table •23 periodic table 1 H 1.0080 3 Li 6.9414 Be 9.0122 11 Na 22.99012 Mg 24.305 19 K 39.09820 Ca 40.08 37 Rb 85.4738 Sr21 Sc 44.956 39 Y 87.62 55 Cs 132.9156 Ba 137.345 B 10.811 13 Al 26.982 31 Ga 69.72 49 In 114.82 81 Tl 204.386 C 12.011 14 Si 28.086 32 Ge 72.64 50 Sn 118.71 82 Pb 207.197 N 14.007 15 P 30.974 33 As 74.922 51 Sb 121.76 83 Bi 208.988 O 15.999 16 S 32.064 34 Se 78.96 52 Te 127.60 84 Po (209)9 F 18.998 17 Cl 35.453 35 Br 79.904 53 I 126.90 85 At (210)10 Ne 20.1802 He 4.0026 18 Ar 39.948 36 Kr 83.80 54 Xe 131.30 86 Rn (222)22 Ti 47.87 40 Zr 91.22 88.91 72 Hf 178.4923 V 50.942 41 Nb 92.91 73 Ta 180.9524 Cr 51.996 42 Mo 95.94 74 W 183.8425 Mn 54.938 43 Tc (98) 75 Re 186.226 Fe 55.845 44 Ru 101.07 76 Os 190.2327 Co 58.933 45 Rh 102.91 77 Ir 192.228 Ni 58.69 46 Pd 106.4 78 Pt 195.08 104 Rf (261)105 Db (262)106 Sg (266)107 Bh (264)108 Hs (277)109 Mt (268)110 Ds (281)29 Cu 63.5429 Cu 63.54 47 Ag 107.87 79 Au 196.9730 Zn 65.41 48 Cd 112.41 80 Hg 200.59 66 Dy 162.50 98 Cf (251)67 Ho 164.93 99 Es (252)68 Er 167.26 100 Fm (257)69 Tm 168.93 101 Md (258)70 Yb 173.04 102 No (259)71 Lu 174.97 103 Lr (262)57 La 138.91 89 Ac (227)58 Ce 140.12 90 Th 232.0459 Pr 140.91 91 Pa 231.0460 Nd 144.24 92 U 238.0361 Pm (145) 93 Np (237)62 Sm 150.35 94 Pu (244)63 Eu 151.96 95 Am (243)64 Gd 157.25 96 Cm (247)65 Tb 158.92 97 Bk (247)87 Fr (223)88 Ra (226)Atomic number SymbolMetal Nonmetal IntermediateAtomic weightKey IA IIA IIIB IVB VB VIB VIIBVIII IB IIBIIIA IVA VA VIA VIIA0 Rare earth series Actinide seriesActi- nide seriesRare earth series Figure 2.6 The periodic table of the elements.

The numbers in parentheses are the atomic weights of the most stable or common isotopes.1496T_c02_15-37 11/10/05 10:42 Page 23REVISED PAGESAs may be noted from the periodic table, most of the elements really come un- der the metal classification. These are sometimes termed electropositive elements, indicating that they are capable of giving up their few valence electrons to become positively charged ions. Furthermore, the elements situated on the right-hand sideof the table are electronegative; that is, they readily accept electrons to form neg- atively charged ions, or sometimes they share electrons with other atoms. Figure 2.7displays electronegativity values that have been assigned to the various elementsarranged in the periodic table. As a general rule, electronegativity increases in mov-ing from left to right and from bottom to top. Atoms are more likely to accept elec-trons if their outer shells are almost full, and if they are less “shielded” from (i.e.,closer to) the nucleus. Atomic Bonding in Solids 2.5 BONDING FORCES AND ENERGIES An understanding of many of the physical properties of materials is predicated ona knowledge of the interatomic forces that bind the atoms together. Perhaps theprinciples of atomic bonding are best illustrated by considering the interactionbetween two isolated atoms as they are brought into close proximity from an infi-nite separation. At large distances, the interactions are negligible, but as the atomsapproach, each exerts forces on the other. These forces are of two types, attractiveand repulsive, and the magnitude of each is a function of the separation or inter-atomic distance. The origin of an attractive force F Adepends on the particular type of bonding that exists between the two atoms. The magnitude of the attractive forcevaries with the distance, as represented schematically in Figure 2.8 a.

2.8 a. Ultimately, the outer electron shells of the two atoms begin to overlap, and a strong repulsiveforce F Rcomes into play. The net force FNbetween the two atoms is just the sum of both attractive and repulsive components; that is, (2.2) FN/H11005FA/H11001FR24 •Chapter 2 / Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding Figure 2.7 The electronegativity values for the elements.

2.8 a. When FAand FRbalance, or become equal, there is no net force; that is, (2.3) Then a state of equilibrium exists. The centers of the two atoms will remain sepa- rated by the equilibrium spacing r0, as indicated in Figure 2.8 a. For many atoms, r0 is approximately 0.3 nm. Once in this position, the two atoms will counteract anyattempt to separate them by an attractive force, or to push them together by arepulsive action. Sometimes it is more convenient to work with the potential energies between two atoms instead of forces. Mathematically, energy (E ) and force (F ) are related as (2.4) or, for atomic systems, (2.5) (2.6) (2.7) /H11005E A/H11001ER /H11005/H20910r qFA dr /H11001/H20910r qFR dr EN/H11005/H20910r qFN drE/H11005/H20910 F drFA/H11001FR/H1100502.5 Bonding Forces and Energies •25 + – –(a) (b)Interatomic separation r Interatomic separation rRepulsive force FRAttractive force FA Net force FNAttraction RepulsionForce F Repulsive energy ER Attractive energy EANet energy EN+0 0Attraction RepulsionPotential energy Er0 E0Figure 2.8 (a) The dependence of repulsive, attractive, and net forces oninteratomic separation fortwo isolated atoms.

adjacent atoms. Figure 2.8b plots attractive, repulsive, and net potential energies as a function of interatomic separation for two atoms. The net curve, which is again the sum of the other two, has a potential energy trough or well around its minimum. Here, the sameequilibrium spacing, r 0, corresponds to the separation distance at the minimum of the potential energy curve. The bonding energy for these two atoms, E0, corresponds to the energy at this minimum point (also shown in Figure 2.8 b); it represents the en- ergy that would be required to separate these two atoms to an infinite separation. Although the preceding treatment has dealt with an ideal situation involving only two atoms, a similar yet more complex condition exists for solid materials be-cause force and energy interactions among many atoms must be considered. Nev-ertheless, a bonding energy, analogous to E 0above, may be associated with each atom. The magnitude of this bonding energy and the shape of the energy-versus-interatomic separation curve vary from material to material, and they both dependon the type of atomic bonding. Furthermore, a number of material properties de-pend on E 0, the curve shape, and bonding type. For example, materials having large bonding energies typically also have high melting temperatures; at room tempera-ture, solid substances are formed for large bonding energies, whereas for smallenergies the gaseous state is favored; liquids prevail when the energies are of inter-mediate magnitude. In addition, as discussed in Section 6.3, the mechanical stiffness(or modulus of elasticity) of a material is dependent on the shape of its force-versus-interatomic separation curve (Figure 6.7). The slope for a relatively stiff material atthe rr 0position on the curve will be quite steep; slopes are shallower for more flexible materials. Furthermore, how much a material expands upon heating or con-tracts upon cooling (that is, its linear coefficient of thermal expansion) is related tothe shape of its E 0-versus-r 0curve (see Section 19.3).

Section 19.3). A deep and narrow “trough,” which typically occurs for materials having large bonding energies, normally corre-lates with a low coefficient of thermal expansion and relatively small dimensionalalterations for changes in temperature. Three different types of primary or chemical bond are found in solids—ionic, covalent, and metallic. For each type, the bonding necessarily involves the valenceelectrons; furthermore, the nature of the bond depends on the electron structuresof the constituent atoms. In general, each of these three types of bonding arisesfrom the tendency of the atoms to assume stable electron structures, like those ofthe inert gases, by completely filling the outermost electron shell. Secondary or physical forces and energies are also found in many solid mate- rials; they are weaker than the primary ones, but nonetheless influence the physi-cal properties of some materials. The sections that follow explain the several kindsof primary and secondary interatomic bonds. 2.6 PRIMARY INTERATOMIC BONDS Ionic Bonding Ionic bonding is perhaps the easiest to describe and visualize. It is always found in compounds that are composed of both metallic and nonmetallic elements, elementsthat are situated at the horizontal extremities of the periodic table.Atoms of a metal-lic element easily give up their valence electrons to the nonmetallic atoms. In theprocess all the atoms acquire stable or inert gas configurations and, in addition, anelectrical charge; that is, they become ions. Sodium chloride (NaCl) is the classic ionicmaterial. A sodium atom can assume the electron structure of neon (and a net single/H11005bonding energy primary bond ionic bonding1496T_c02_15-37 11/10/05 10:42 Page 26REVISED PAGESpositive charge) by a transfer of its one valence 3 selectron to a chlorine atom. Af- ter such a transfer, the chlorine ion has a net negative charge and an electron con- figuration identical to that of argon.

of argon. In sodium chloride, all the sodium and chlorineexist as ions. This type of bonding is illustrated schematically in Figure 2.9. The attractive bonding forces are coulombic; that is, positive and negative ions, by virtue of their net electrical charge, attract one another. For two isolated ions,the attractive energy E Ais a function of the interatomic distance according to3 (2.8) An analogous equation for the repulsive energy is (2.9) In these expressions, A,B, and nare constants whose values depend on the partic- ular ionic system. The value of nis approximately 8. Ionic bonding is termed nondirectional; that is, the magnitude of the bond is equal in all directions around an ion. It follows that for ionic materials to be stable, allpositive ions must have as nearest neighbors negatively charged ions in a three-dimensional scheme, and vice versa. The predominant bonding in ceramic materials isionic. Some of the ion arrangements for these materials are discussed in Chapter 12. Bonding energies, which generally range between 600 and 1500 kJ/mol (3 and 8 eV/atom), are relatively large, as reflected in high melting temperatures. 4Table 2.3 contains bonding energies and melting temperatures for several ionic materials.ER/H11005B r nEA/H11005/H11002 A r2.6 Primary Interatomic Bonds •27 Na+Na+Coulombic bonding force Na+Cl–Cl– Na+Na+Na+Cl–Cl–Na+Na+Cl–Cl–Cl– Na+Na+Cl–Cl–Cl–Figure 2.9 Schematic representation of ionic bonding in sodium chloride (NaCl). 3The constant A in Equation 2.8 is equal to where is the permittivity of a vacuum Z1and Z2are the valences of the two ion types, and e is the electronic charge 4Sometimes bonding energies are expressed per atom or per ion.

As discussed in subsequent chapters, these properties are a directconsequence of electron configurations and/or the nature of the ionic bond. Covalent Bonding In covalent bonding, stable electron configurations are assumed by the sharing of electrons between adjacent atoms. Two atoms that are covalently bonded will eachcontribute at least one electron to the bond, and the shared electrons may be con-sidered to belong to both atoms. Covalent bonding is schematically illustrated inFigure 2.10 for a molecule of methane . The carbon atom has four valenceelectrons, whereas each of the four hydrogen atoms has a single valence electron.Each hydrogen atom can acquire a helium electron configuration (two 1 svalence electrons) when the carbon atom shares with it one electron. The carbon now hasfour additional shared electrons, one from each hydrogen, for a total of eight valenceelectrons, and the electron structure of neon. The covalent bond is directional; thatis, it is between specific atoms and may exist only in the direction between one atomand another that participates in the electron sharing.1CH 4228 •Chapter 2 / Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding Table 2.3 Bonding Energies and Melting Temperatures for Various Substances Bonding EnergyMelting eV/Atom, Temperature Bonding Type Substance kJ/mol Ion, Molecule (°C) IonicNaCl 640 3.3 801 MgO 1000 5.2 2800 CovalentSi 450 4.7 1410 C (diamond) 713 7.4 /H110223550 Hg 68 0.7 /H1100239 MetallicAl 324 3.4 660 Fe 406 4.2 1538 W 849 8.8 3410 van der WaalsAr 7.7 0.08 /H11002189 Cl2 31 0.32 /H11002101 HydrogenNH 3 35 0.36 /H1100278 H2O 51 0.52 0 Shared electron from hydrogenShared electron from carbon H H CH HFigure 2.10 Schematic representation of covalent bonding in a molecule of methane .1CH42covalent bonding1496T_c02_15-37 11/10/05 10:42 Page 28REVISED PAGESMany nonmetallic elemental molecules as well as molecules containing dissimilar atoms, such as and HF, are covalently bonded.

covalently bonded. Furthermore, this type of bonding is found in elemental solids such as di- amond (carbon), silicon, and germanium and other solid compounds composed ofelements that are located on the right-hand side of the periodic table, such as gal-lium arsenide (GaAs), indium antimonide (InSb), and silicon carbide (SiC). The number of covalent bonds that is possible for a particular atom is deter- mined by the number of valence electrons. For valence electrons, an atom cancovalently bond with at most other atoms. For example, for chlorine,and which means that one Cl atom can bond to only one other atom, as in . Similarly, for carbon, and each carbon atom has or four,electrons to share. Diamond is simply the three-dimensional interconnecting struc-ture wherein each carbon atom covalently bonds with four other carbon atoms. Thisarrangement is represented in Figure 12.15. Covalent bonds may be very strong, as in diamond, which is very hard and has a very high melting temperature, or they may be very weak, as with bismuth, which melts at about . Bonding energies and melting temperatures for a few covalently bonded materials are presented in Table 2.3.Polymeric materials typify this bond, the basic molecular structure being a longchain of carbon atoms that are covalently bonded together with two of their avail-able four bonds per atom. The remaining two bonds normally are shared with otheratoms, which also covalently bond. Polymeric molecular structures are discussed indetail in Chapter 14. It is possible to have interatomic bonds that are partially ionic and partially co- valent, and, in fact, very few compounds exhibit pure ionic or covalent bonding. Fora compound, the degree of either bond type depends on the relative positions ofthe constituent atoms in the periodic table (Figure 2.6) or the difference in theirelectronegativities (Figure 2.7).The wider the separation (both horizontally—relativeto Group IVA—and vertically) from the lower left to the upper-right-hand corner(i.e., the greater the difference in electronegativity), the more ionic the bond.

the bond. Con-versely, the closer the atoms are together (i.e., the smaller the difference in elec-tronegativity), the greater the degree of covalency. The percentage ionic characterof a bond between elements A and B (A being the most electronegative) may beapproximated by the expression % ionic character (2.10) where and are the electronegativities for the respective elements. Metallic Bonding Metallic bonding, the final primary bonding type, is found in metals and their al- loys. A relatively simple model has been proposed that very nearly approximatesthe bonding scheme. Metallic materials have one, two, or at most, three valence elec-trons. With this model, these valence electrons are not bound to any particular atomin the solid and are more or less free to drift throughout the entire metal. They maybe thought of as belonging to the metal as a whole, or forming a “sea of electrons”or an “electron cloud.” The remaining nonvalence electrons and atomic nuclei formwhat are called ion cores, which possess a net positive charge equal in magnitude to the total valence electron charge per atom. Figure 2.11 is a schematic illustrationof metallic bonding. The free electrons shield the positively charged ion cores frommutually repulsive electrostatic forces, which they would otherwise exert upon oneanother; consequently the metallic bond is nondirectional in character. In addition,these free electrons act as a “glue” to hold the ion cores together.

Metallic bonding is found in the periodic table for Group IA and IIA elements and, in fact, for all elemental metals. Some general behaviors of the various material types (i.e., metals, ceramics, polymers) may be explained by bonding type. For example, metals are good con-ductors of both electricity and heat, as a consequence of their free electrons (seeSections 18.5, 18.6 and 19.4). By way of contrast, ionically and covalently bondedmaterials are typically electrical and thermal insulators, due to the absence of largenumbers of free electrons. Furthermore, in Section 7.4 we note that at room temperature, most metals and their alloys fail in a ductile manner; that is, fracture occurs after the materials haveexperienced significant degrees of permanent deformation. This behavior is ex-plained in terms of deformation mechanism (Section 7.2), which is implicitly relatedto the characteristics of the metallic bond. Conversely, at room temperature ioni-cally bonded materials are intrinsically brittle as a consequence of the electricallycharged nature of their component ions (see Section 12.10). Concept Check 2.3 Offer an explanation as to why covalently bonded materials are generally less densethan ionically or metallically bonded ones. [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 2.7 SECONDARY BONDING OR VAN DER WAALS BONDING Secondary, van der Waals, or physical bonds are weak in comparison to the primary or chemical ones; bonding energies are typically on the order of only 10 kJ/mol(0.1 eV/atom).

Secondary bonding exists between virtually all atoms or molecules,3410/H11034C 1/H1100238 and 6170/H11034F 2 /H110023930 •Chapter 2 / Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding + –+ –+ –+ + –+ –+ –+ + –+ –+ –+ + + + +Ion cores Sea of valence electronsFigure 2.11 Schematic illustration of metallic bonding. secondary bond van der Waals bond1496T_c02_15-37 12/20/05 7:19 Page 302nd REVISE PAGESbut its presence may be obscured if any of the three primary bonding types is pres- ent. Secondary bonding is evidenced for the inert gases, which have stable electronstructures, and, in addition, between molecules in molecular structures that arecovalently bonded. Secondary bonding forces arise from atomic or molecular dipoles. In essence, an electric dipole exists whenever there is some separation of positive and nega-tive portions of an atom or molecule. The bonding results from the coulombic at-traction between the positive end of one dipole and the negative region of anadjacent one, as indicated in Figure 2.12. Dipole interactions occur between induceddipoles, between induced dipoles and polar molecules (which have permanentdipoles), and between polar molecules. Hydrogen bonding, a special type of sec- ondary bonding, is found to exist between some molecules that have hydrogen asone of the constituents. These bonding mechanisms are now discussed briefly. Fluctuating Induced Dipole Bonds A dipole may be created or induced in an atom or molecule that is normally elec-trically symmetric; that is, the overall spatial distribution of the electrons is sym-metric with respect to the positively charged nucleus, as shown in Figure 2.13 a. All atoms are experiencing constant vibrational motion that can cause instantaneousand short-lived distortions of this electrical symmetry for some of the atoms or mol-ecules, and the creation of small electric dipoles, as represented in Figure 2.13 b.

2.13 b. One of these dipoles can in turn produce a displacement of the electron distribution ofan adjacent molecule or atom, which induces the second one also to become a di-pole that is then weakly attracted or bonded to the first; this is one type of van derWaals bonding. These attractive forces may exist between large numbers of atomsor molecules, which forces are temporary and fluctuate with time. The liquefaction and, in some cases, the solidification of the inert gases and other electrically neutral and symmetric molecules such as and are realizedbecause of this type of bonding. Melting and boiling temperatures are extremelylow in materials for which induced dipole bonding predominates; of all possibleintermolecular bonds, these are the weakest. Bonding energies and melting tem-peratures for argon and chlorine are also tabulated in Table 2.3. Polar Molecule-Induced Dipole Bonds Permanent dipole moments exist in some molecules by virtue of an asymmetricalarrangement of positively and negatively charged regions; such molecules areCl 2 H22.7 Secondary Bonding or van der Waals Bonding •31 – + – + Atomic or molecular dipolesFigure 2.12 Schematic illustration of van der Waals bonding between two dipoles. dipole hydrogen bonding – +Atomic nucleusAtomic nucleus Electron cloud (a) (b)Electron cloudFigure 2.13 Schematic representations of (a) an electrically symmetricatom and (b) an inducedatomic dipole.1496T_c02_15-37 12/20/05 7:19 Page 312nd REVISE PAGEStermed polar molecules. Figure 2.14 is a schematic representation of a hydrogen chloride molecule; a permanent dipole moment arises from net positive and nega- tive charges that are respectively associated with the hydrogen and chlorine endsof the HCl molecule. Polar molecules can also induce dipoles in adjacent nonpolar molecules, and a bond will form as a result of attractive forces between the two molecules.

two molecules. Further-more, the magnitude of this bond will be greater than for fluctuating induced dipoles. Permanent Dipole Bonds Van der Waals forces will also exist between adjacent polar molecules. The associatedbonding energies are significantly greater than for bonds involving induced dipoles. The strongest secondary bonding type, the hydrogen bond, is a special case of po- lar molecule bonding. It occurs between molecules in which hydrogen is covalentlybonded to fluorine (as in HF), oxygen (as in ), and nitrogen (as in ). Foreach H—F, H—O, or H—N bond, the single hydrogen electron is shared with theother atom. Thus, the hydrogen end of the bond is essentially a positively chargedbare proton that is unscreened by any electrons. This highly positively charged endof the molecule is capable of a strong attractive force with the negative end of anadjacent molecule, as demonstrated in Figure 2.15 for HF. In essence, this single pro-ton forms a bridge between two negatively charged atoms. The magnitude of the hy-drogen bond is generally greater than that of the other types of secondary bondsand may be as high as 51 kJ/mol (0.52 eV/molecule), as shown in Table 2.3. Meltingand boiling temperatures for hydrogen fluoride and water are abnormally high inlight of their low molecular weights, as a consequence of hydrogen bonding. 2.8 MOLECULES Many of the common molecules are composed of groups of atoms that are boundtogether by strong covalent bonds; these include elemental diatomic molecules as well as a host of compounds In the condensed liquid and solid states, bonds between molecules are weak sec-ondary ones. Consequently, molecular materials have relatively low melting andboiling temperatures. Most of those that have small molecules composed of a fewatoms are gases at ordinary, or ambient, temperatures and pressures. On the otherhand, many of the modern polymers, being molecular materials composed ofextremely large molecules, exist as solids; some of their properties are stronglydependent on the presence of van der Waals and hydrogen secondary bonds.1H 2O, CO2, HNO3, C6H6, CH4, etc.2.

One exceptionis water, which exhibits the anomalous and fa-miliar expansion upon freezing—approximately9 volume percent expansion. This behavior maybe explained on the basis of hydrogen bonding.Each molecule has two hydrogen atoms thatcan bond to oxygen atoms; in addition, its singleO atom can bond to two hydrogen atoms of other molecules. Thus, for solid ice, each water molecule participates in four hydrogen bonds asshown in the three-dimensional schematic ofFigure 2.16 a; here hydrogen bonds are denoted by dashed lines, and each water molecule has 4nearest-neighbor molecules. This is a relativelyopen structure—i.e., the molecules are notclosely packed together—and, as a result, theH 2OH2O Figure 2.16 The arrangement of water molecules in (a) solid ice, and (b) liquid water.1H2O2H HH HHH H H HH H HHH H HHHH H O O OO OOO O O O (b)O OO O OH H HH HHHydrogen bond (a)H HH density is comparatively low.

Whereas the Bohrmodel assumes electrons to be particles orbiting the nucleus in discrete paths, inwave mechanics we consider them to be wave-like and treat electron position interms of a probability distribution. Electron energy states are specified in terms of quantum numbers that give rise to electron shells and subshells. The electron configuration of an atom correspondsto the manner in which these shells and subshells are filled with electrons in compli-ance with the Pauli exclusion principle.The periodic table of the elements is generatedby arrangement of the various elements according to valence electron configuration. Bonding Forces and Energies Primary Interatomic Bonds Atomic bonding in solids may be considered in terms of attractive and repulsive forces and energies. The three types of primary bond in solids are ionic, covalent,and metallic. For ionic bonds, electrically charged ions are formed by the transfer-ence of valence electrons from one atom type to another; forces are coulombic.Thereis a sharing of valence electrons between adjacent atoms when bonding is covalent.With metallic bonding, the valence electrons form a “sea of electrons” that is uni-formly dispersed around the metal ion cores and acts as a form of glue for them.

for them. Secondary Bonding or van der Waals Bonding Both van der Waals and hydrogen bonds are termed secondary, being weak in com- parison to the primary ones. They result from attractive forces between electricdipoles, of which there are two types—induced and permanent. For the hydrogenbond, highly polar molecules form when hydrogen covalently bonds to a nonmetallicelement such as fluorine.34 •Chapter 2 / Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding Atomic mass unit (amu)Atomic numberAtomic weightBohr atomic modelBonding energyCoulombic forceCovalent bondDipole (electric)Electron configurationElectron stateElectronegativeElectropositiveGround stateHydrogen bondIonic bondIsotopeMetallic bondMolePauli exclusion principlePeriodic tablePolar moleculePrimary bondingQuantum mechanicsQuantum numberSecondary bondingValence electronvan der Waals bondWave-mechanical model Note: In each chapter, most of the terms listed in the “Important Terms and Concepts” section are defined in the Glossary, which follows Appendix E.

For example, pure and un-deformed magnesium and beryllium, having one crys-tal structure, are much more brittle (i.e., fracture atlower degrees of deformation) than are pure and un-deformed metals such as gold and silver that have yetanother crystal structure (see Section 7.4).Furthermore, significant property differences exist between crystalline and noncrystalline materialshaving the same composition. For example, noncrys-talline ceramics and polymers normally are opticallytransparent; the same materials in crystalline (or semi-crystalline) form tend to be opaque or, at best,translucent.

The present dis-cussion is devoted to the next level of the structure of materials, specifically, to someof the arrangements that may be assumed by atoms in the solid state. Within thisframework, concepts of crystallinity and noncrystallinity are introduced. For crys-talline solids the notion of crystal structure is presented, specified in terms of a unitcell. The three common crystal structures found in metals are then detailed, alongwith the scheme by which crystallographic points, directions, and planes are ex-pressed. Single crystals, polycrystalline, and noncrystalline materials are considered.The final section of this chapter briefly describes how crystal structures are deter-mined experimentally using x-ray diffraction techniques.

A crystalline material is one in which the atoms are situated in a repeating or periodic array over large atomic distances;that is, long-range order exists, such that upon solidification, the atoms will positionthemselves in a repetitive three-dimensional pattern, in which each atom is bondedto its nearest-neighbor atoms. All metals, many ceramic materials, and certain poly-mers form crystalline structures under normal solidification conditions. For thosethat do not crystallize, this long-range atomic order is absent; these noncrystalline or amorphous materials are discussed briefly at the end of this chapter. Some of the properties of crystalline solids depend on the crystal structure of the material, the manner in which atoms, ions, or molecules are spatially arranged.There is an extremely large number of different crystal structures all having long-range atomic order; these vary from relatively simple structures for metals toexceedingly complex ones, as displayed by some of the ceramic and polymericmaterials. The present discussion deals with several common metallic crystal struc-tures. Chapters 12 and 14 are devoted to crystal structures for ceramics and poly-mers, respectively.Learning Objectives After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1.Describe the difference in atomic/molecular structure between crystalline and noncrystallinematerials. 2.Draw unit cells for face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, and hexagonal close-packedcrystal structures. 3.Derive the relationships between unit cell edgelength and atomic radius for face-centered cubicand body-centered cubic crystal structures. 4.Compute the densities for metals having face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic crystalstructures given their unit cell dimensions.5.Given three direction index integers, sketch the direction corresponding to these indices within aunit cell.

aunit cell. 6.Specify the Miller indices for a plane that hasbeen drawn within a unit cell. 7.Describe how face-centered cubic and hexagonalclose-packed crystal structures may be generatedby the stacking of close-packed planes of atoms. 8.Distinguish between single crystals and polycrys-talline materials. 9.Define isotropy and anisotropy with respect to material properties. crystalline crystal structure1496T_c03_38-79 12/20/05 7:38 Page 392nd REVISE PAGESWhen describing crystalline structures, atoms (or ions) are thought of as being solid spheres having well-defined diameters. This is termed the atomic hard sphere model in which spheres representing nearest-neighbor atoms touch one another. An example of the hard sphere model for the atomic arrangement found in some of the common elemental metals is displayed in Figure 3.1 c. In this particular case all the atoms are identical. Sometimes the term lattice is used in the context of crys- tal structures; in this sense “lattice” means a three-dimensional array of pointscoinciding with atom positions (or sphere centers). 3.3 UNIT CELLS The atomic order in crystalline solids indicates that small groups of atoms form arepetitive pattern.Thus, in describing crystal structures, it is often convenient to sub-divide the structure into small repeat entities called unit cells. Unit cells for most crystal structures are parallelepipeds or prisms having three sets of parallel faces;one is drawn within the aggregate of spheres (Figure 3.1 c), which in this case hap- pens to be a cube. A unit cell is chosen to represent the symmetry of the crystalstructure, wherein all the atom positions in the crystal may be generated by trans-lations of the unit cell integral distances along each of its edges. Thus, the unit cellis the basic structural unit or building block of the crystal structure and definesthe crystal structure by virtue of its geometry and the atom positions within.40 •Chapter 3 / The Structure of Crystalline Solids (a) (b) (c)Figure 3.1 For the face- centered cubic crystal structure, (a) a hardsphere unit cellrepresentation, (b) areduced-sphere unit cell,and (c) an aggregate of many atoms.

Furthermore, more than a single unit cell may be chosen fora particular crystal structure; however, we generally use the unit cell having thehighest level of geometrical symmetry. 3.4 METALLIC CRYSTAL STRUCTURES The atomic bonding in this group of materials is metallic and thus nondirectionalin nature. Consequently, there are minimal restrictions as to the number and posi-tion of nearest-neighbor atoms; this leads to relatively large numbers of nearestneighbors and dense atomic packings for most metallic crystal structures. Also, formetals, using the hard sphere model for the crystal structure, each sphere repre-sents an ion core. Table 3.1 presents the atomic radii for a number of metals. Threerelatively simple crystal structures are found for most of the common metals: face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, and hexagonal close-packed. The Face-Centered Cubic Crystal Structure The crystal structure found for many metals has a unit cell of cubic geometry, withatoms located at each of the corners and the centers of all the cube faces. It is aptlycalled the face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. Some of the familiar metals hav- ing this crystal structure are copper, aluminum, silver, and gold (see also Table 3.1).Figure 3.1a shows a hard sphere model for the FCC unit cell, whereas in Figure 3.1 b the atom centers are represented by small circles to provide a better perspective ofatom positions.

ofatom positions. The aggregate of atoms in Figure 3.1 crepresents a section of crystal consisting of many FCC unit cells.These spheres or ion cores touch one another acrossa face diagonal; the cube edge length aand the atomic radius R are related through (3.1) This result is obtained in Example Problem 3.1. For the FCC crystal structure, each corner atom is shared among eight unit cells, whereas a face-centered atom belongs to only two. Therefore, one-eighth of each ofthe eight corner atoms and one-half of each of the six face atoms, or a total of fourwhole atoms, may be assigned to a given unit cell. This is depicted in Figure 3.1 a, where only sphere portions are represented within the confines of the cube.

the figure. Corner and face positions are really equivalent; that is, translation of the cube corner from an original corner atom to the center of a face atom will not alter thecell structure. Two other important characteristics of a crystal structure are the coordination number and the atomic packing factor (APF). For metals, each atom has the same number of nearest-neighbor or touching atoms, which is the coordination number.For face-centered cubics, the coordination number is 12. This may be confirmed byexamination of Figure 3.1 a; the front face atom has four corner nearest-neighbor atoms surrounding it, four face atoms that are in contact from behind, and four otherequivalent face atoms residing in the next unit cell to the front, which is not shown. The APF is the sum of the sphere volumes of all atoms within a unit cell (as- suming the atomic hard sphere model) divided by the unit cell volume—that is (3.2) For the FCC structure, the atomic packing factor is 0.74, which is the maximumpacking possible for spheres all having the same diameter. Computation of this APFis also included as an example problem. Metals typically have relatively large atomicpacking factors to maximize the shielding provided by the free electron cloud. The Body-Centered Cubic Crystal Structure Another common metallic crystal structure also has a cubic unit cell with atomslocated at all eight corners and a single atom at the cube center. This is called abody-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure. A collection of spheres depicting this crystal structure is shown in Figure 3.2 c, whereas Figures 3.2 aand 3.2b are diagrams of BCC unit cells with the atoms represented by hard sphere and reduced-spheremodels, respectively.

Two atoms are associated with each BCC unit cell: the equivalent of one atom from the eight corners, each of which is shared among eight unit cells, and the sin-gle center atom, which is wholly contained within its cell. In addition, corner andcenter atom positions are equivalent. The coordination number for the BCC crys-tal structure is 8; each center atom has as nearest neighbors its eight corner atoms.Since the coordination number is less for BCC than FCC, so also is the atomic pack-ing factor for BCC lower—0.68 versus 0.74. The Hexagonal Close-Packed Crystal Structure Not all metals have unit cells with cubic symmetry; the final common metalliccrystal structure to be discussed has a unit cell that is hexagonal. Figure 3.3 ashows a reduced-sphere unit cell for this structure, which is termed hexagonal close-packed (HCP); an assemblage of several HCP unit cells is presented in Figure 3.3b. 1The top and bottom faces of the unit cell consist of six atoms that form regular hexagons and surround a single atom in the center. Another plane thatprovides three additional atoms to the unit cell is situated between the top andbottom planes. The atoms in this midplane have as nearest neighbors atoms inboth of the adjacent two planes. The equivalent of six atoms is contained in eachunit cell; one-sixth of each of the 12 top and bottom face corner atoms, one-halfof each of the 2 center face atoms, and all 3 midplane interior atoms.

Compute its theoretical density and compare theanswer with its measured density. Solution Equation 3.5 is employed in the solution of this problem. Since the crystal structure is FCC, n, the number of atoms per unit cell, is 4. Furthermore, the atomic weight is given as 63.5 g/mol. The unit cell volume for FCC wasdetermined in Example Problem 3.1 as where R, the atomic radius, is 0.128 nm.

as polymorphism. When found in elemental solids, the condition is often termed allotropy. The prevailing crystal structure depends on both the tem- perature and the external pressure. One familiar example is found in carbon:graphite is the stable polymorph at ambient conditions, whereas diamond is formedat extremely high pressures. Also, pure iron has a BCC crystal structure at roomtemperature, which changes to FCC iron at C ( F). Most often a modifi-cation of the density and other physical properties accompanies a polymorphictransformation. 3.7 CRYSTAL SYSTEMS Since there are many different possible crystal structures, it is sometimes conve-nient to divide them into groups according to unit cell configurations and/or atomicarrangements. One such scheme is based on the unit cell geometry, that is, the shapeof the appropriate unit cell parallelepiped without regard to the atomic positionsin the cell. Within this framework, an x,y,zcoordinate system is established with its origin at one of the unit cell corners; each of the x,y, and zaxes coincides with one of the three parallelepiped edges that extend from this corner, as illustrated inFigure 3.4. The unit cell geometry is completely defined in terms of six parameters:the three edge lengths a,b, and c, and the three interaxial angles , , and . These are indicated in Figure 3.4, and are sometimes termed the lattice parameters of a crystal structure. On this basis there are seven different possible combinations of a,b, and c, and , , and each of which represents a distinct crystal system. These seven crystal systems are cubic, tetragonal, hexagonal, orthorhombic, rhombohedral, 2monoclinic, and triclinic. The lattice parameter relationships and unit cell sketches for each arerepresented in Table 3.2.The cubic system, for which and has the greatest degree of symmetry. Least symmetry is displayed by the triclinicsystem, since and From the discussion of metallic crystal structures, it should be apparent that both FCC and BCC structures belong to the cubic crystal system, whereas HCPfalls within hexagonal.

is tin. White (or ) tin, hav- ing a body-centered tetragonal crystal structure atroom temperature, transforms, at C ( F), 55.8/H11034 13.2/H11034bto gray (or ) tin, which has a crystal structure sim-ilar to diamond (i.e., the diamond cubic crystalstructure); this transformation is representedschematically as follows:a Specimen of white tin (left). Another specimen disintegrated upon transforming to gray tin (right)after it was cooled to and held at a temperaturebelow C for an extended period of time. (Photograph courtesy of Professor Bill Plumbridge,Department of Materials Engineering, The OpenUniversity, Milton Keynes, England. )13.2/H11034White (/H9252) tinCooling13.2 °C Gray (/H9251) tin The rate at which this change takes place is ex- tremely slow; however, the lower the temperature(below C) the faster the rate. Accompanyingthis white tin-to-gray tin transformation is an in-crease in volume (27 percent), and, accordingly, adecrease in density (from 7.30 g/cm 3to 5.77 g/cm3). Consequently, this volume expansion results in thedisintegration of the white tin metal into a coarsepowder of the gray allotrope. For normal subam-bient temperatures, there is no need to worryabout this disintegration process for tin products,due to the very slow rate at which the transfor-mation occurs. This white-to-gray-tin transition produced some rather dramatic results in 1850 in Russia.Thewinter that year was particularly cold, and recordlow temperatures persisted for extended periodsof time.The uniforms of some Russian soldiers hadtin buttons, many of which crumbled due to theseextreme cold conditions, as did also many of thetin church organ pipes.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] It is important to note that many of the principles and concepts addressed in previous discussions in this chapter also apply to crystalline ceramic and poly- meric systems (Chapters 12 and 14). For example, crystal structures are most of-ten described in terms of unit cells, which are normally more complex than thosefor FCC, BCC, and HCP . In addition, for these other systems, we are often in-terested in determining atomic packing factors and densities, using modifiedforms of Equations 3.2 and 3.5. Furthermore, according to unit cell geometry,crystal structures of these other material types are grouped within the seven crys-tal systems. Crystallographic Points, Directions, and Planes When dealing with crystalline materials, it often becomes necessary to specify a par-ticular point within a unit cell, a crystallographic direction, or some crystallographicplane of atoms. Labeling conventions have been established in which three num-bers or indices are used to designate point locations, directions, and planes.The basisfor determining index values is the unit cell, with a right-handed coordinate systemconsisting of three (x, y, and z) axes situated at one of the corners and coinciding with the unit cell edges, as shown in Figure 3.4.

Figure 3.4. For some crystal systems—namely,hexagonal, rhombohedral, monoclinic, and triclinic—the three axes are notmutu- ally perpendicular, as in the familiar Cartesian coordinate scheme. 3.8 POINT COORDINATES The position of any point located within a unit cell may be specified in terms of itscoordinates as fractional multiples of the unit cell edge lengths (i.e., in terms of a, b, and c).To illustrate, consider the unit cell and the point P situated therein as shown in Figure 3.5. We specify the position of Pin terms of the generalized coordinates3.8 Point Coordinates •491496T_c03_38-79 11/11/05 19:05 Page 49REVISED PAGESSolution From sketch (a), edge lengths for this unit cell are as follows: nm, nm, and nm. Furthermore, in light of the above discussion, fractional lengths are and Therefore, first we move from the origin of the unit cell (point M) units along the xaxis (to point N), as shown in the ( b) sketch. Similarly, we proceed (0.46 nm) /H11005 0.46 nm parallel to the yaxis, from point N to point O. Finally, we move from this position, units parallel to the z axis to point P as noted again in sketch ( b). This point P then corre- sponds to the point coordinates. EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3.5 Specification of Point Coordinates Specify point coordinates for all atom positions for a BCC unit cell. Solution For the BCC unit cell of Figure 3.2, atom position coordinates correspond to the locations of the centers of all atoms in the unit cell—that is, the eightcorner atoms and single center atom.These positions are noted (and also num-bered) in the following figure.1 4 1 1 2sc/H110051 2 (0.40 nm) /H110050.20 nmrb/H11005(1)qa/H110051 4 (0.48 nm) /H110050.12 nms/H110051 r/H110051, q/H110051 4,c/H110050.40 b/H110050.46a/H110050.48q,r, and swhere qis some fractional length of a along the x axis, ris some fractional length of b along the y axis, and similarly for s.

a vector. The following steps are utilized in the determination of the three directional indices: 1.A vector of convenient length is positioned such that it passes through theorigin of the coordinate system. Any vector may be translated throughout thecrystal lattice without alteration, if parallelism is maintained. 2.The length of the vector projection on each of the three axes is determined;these are measured in terms of the unit cell dimensions a, b,and c. 3.These three numbers are multiplied or divided by a common factor to reducethem to the smallest integer values. 4.The three indices, not separated by commas, are enclosed in square brackets,thus: [ uvw]. The u,v, and wintegers correspond to the reduced projections along the x, y, and zaxes, respectively.Crystallographic Directions1496T_c03_38-79 11/11/05 19:05 Page 51REVISED PAGESFor each of the three axes, there will exist both positive and negative coordi- nates. Thus negative indices are also possible, which are represented by a bar over the appropriate index. For example, the [ ] direction would have a component inthe direction. Also, changing the signs of all indices produces an antiparalleldirection; that is, [ ] is directly opposite to [ ]. If more than one direction (orplane) is to be specified for a particular crystal structure, it is imperative for themaintaining of consistency that a positive–negative convention, once established,not be changed.

In the accompanying figure the unit cell is cubic, and the origin of the coordinatesystem, point O, is located at one of the cube corners.11 0 For some crystal structures, several nonparallel directions with different indices are actually equivalent; this means that the spacing of atoms along each directionis the same. For example, in cubic crystals, all the directions represented by the fol-lowing indices are equivalent: [100], [ ], [010], [ ], [001], and [ ]. As a conve-nience, equivalent directions are grouped together into a family, which are enclosed in angle brackets, thus: 81009. Furthermore, directions in cubic crystals having the same indices without regard to order or sign, for example, [123] and [ ], are equiv-alent. This is, in general, not true for other crystal systems. For example, for crystalsof tetragonal symmetry, [100] and [010] directions are equivalent, whereas [100] and[001] are not.2 13001 010 1001496T_c03_38-79 11/11/05 19:05 Page 53REVISED PAGESHexagonal Crystals A problem arises for crystals having hexagonal symmetry in that some crystallo- graphic equivalent directions will not have the same set of indices. This is circum-vented by utilizing a four-axis, or Miller–Bravais, coordinate system as shown in Figure 3.7.The three and axes are all contained within a single plane (calledthe basal plane) and are at angles to one another. The zaxis is perpendicular to this basal plane. Directional indices, which are obtained as described above, willbe denoted by four indices, as [ uvtw]; by convention, the first three indices pertain to projections along the respective and axes in the basal plane. Conversion from the three-index system to the four-index system, is accomplished by the following formulas: (3.6a) (3.6b) (3.6c) (3.6d) where primed indices are associated with the three-index scheme and unprimedwith the new Miller–Bravais four-index system.

Again, the unit cell is the basis, with the three-axis coordinate system as rep-resented in Figure 3.4. In all but the hexagonal crystal system, crystallographic planesare specified by three Miller indices as (hkl). Any two planes parallel to each other Miller indices1496T_c03_38-79 11/11/05 19:05 Page 55REVISED PAGESare equivalent and have identical indices.

identical indices. The procedure employed in determina- tion of the h, k, and lindex numbers is as follows: 1.If the plane passes through the selected origin, either another parallel planemust be constructed within the unit cell by an appropriate translation, or anew origin must be established at the corner of another unit cell. 2.At this point the crystallographic plane either intersects or parallels each ofthe three axes; the length of the planar intercept for each axis is determinedin terms of the lattice parameters a, b, and c. 3.The reciprocals of these numbers are taken. A plane that parallels an axismay be considered to have an infinite intercept, and, therefore, a zero index. 4.If necessary, these three numbers are changed to the set of smallest integersby multiplication or division by a common factor. 3 5.Finally, the integer indices, not separated by commas, are enclosed withinparentheses, thus: (hkl). An intercept on the negative side of the origin is indicated by a bar or mi- nus sign positioned over the appropriate index. Furthermore, reversing the di- rections of all indices specifies another plane parallel to, on the opposite side ofand equidistant from, the origin. Several low-index planes are represented inFigure 3.9. One interesting and unique characteristic of cubic crystals is that planes and di- rections having the same indices are perpendicular to one another; however, forother crystal systems there are no simple geometrical relationships between planesand directions having the same indices.

For example, in cubic crystals the (111), ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), and ( ) planes all belong to the {111}family. On the other hand, for tetragonal crystal structures, the {100} family wouldcontain only the (100), ( ), (010), and ( ) since the (001) and ( ) planes arenot crystallographically equivalent. Also, in the cubic system only, planes havingthe same indices, irrespective of order and sign, are equivalent. For example, both( ) and ( ) belong to the {123} family. Hexagonal Crystals For crystals having hexagonal symmetry, it is desirable that equivalent planes havethe same indices; as with directions, this is accomplished by the Miller–Bravaissystem shown in Figure 3.7. This convention leads to the four-index ( hkil) scheme, which is favored in most instances, since it more clearly identifies the orientationof a plane in a hexagonal crystal. There is some redundancy in that iis determined by the sum of h and kthrough (3.7) Otherwise the three h, k, and lindices are identical for both indexing systems.

Directional equivalency is related to linear density in the sense that, for a particular material, equivalent directions have identical linear densities.The corresponding parameter for crystallographic planes is planar density, and planes having the same planar density values are also equivalent.

also equivalent. Linear density (LD) is defined as the number of atoms per unit length whose centers lie on the direction vector for a specific crystallographic direction; that is, (3.8) Of course, the units of linear density are reciprocal length (e.g., ). For example, let us determine the linear density of the [110] direction for the FCC crystal structure. An FCC unit cell (reduced sphere) and the [110] directiontherein are shown in Figure 3.12 a. Represented in Figure 3.12 bare those five atoms that lie on the bottom face of this unit cell; here the [110] direction vector passesfrom the center of atom X, through atom Y, and finally to the center of atom Z.With regard to the numbers of atoms, it is necessary to take into account the sharingof atoms with adjacent unit cells (as discussed in Section 3.4 relative to atomic pack-ing factor computations). Each of the X and Z corner atoms are also shared withone other adjacent unit cell along this [110] direction (i.e., one-half of each of theseatoms belongs to the unit cell being considered), while atom Y lies entirely withinthe unit cell. Thus, there is an equivalence of two atoms along the [110] directionvector in the unit cell. Now, the direction vector length is equal to 4R (Figure 3.12 b); thus, from Equation 3.8, the [110] linear density for FCC is (3.9) LD 110/H110052 atoms 4R/H110051 2Rnm/H110021, m/H110021LD/H11005number of atoms centered on direction vector length of direction vector1496T_c03_38-79 11/11/05 19:05 Page 60REVISED PAGESIn an analogous manner, planar density (PD) is taken as the number of atoms per unit area that are centered on a particular crystallographic plane, or (3.10) The units for planar density are reciprocal area (e.g., ).

(e.g., ). For example, consider the section of a (110) plane within an FCC unit cell as represented in Figures 3.10 aand 3.10b. Although six atoms have centers that lie on this plane (Figure 3.10 b), only one-quarter of each of atoms A, C, D, and F, and one- half of atoms B and E, for a total equivalence of just 2 atoms are on that plane. Furthermore, the area of this rectangular section is equal to the product of its lengthand width. From Figure 3.10 b, the length (horizontal dimension) is equal to 4 R, whereas the width (vertical dimension) is equal to , since it corresponds tothe FCC unit cell edge length (Equation 3.1). Thus, the area of this planar regionis and the planar density is determined as follows: (3.11) Linear and planar densities are important considerations relative to the process ofslip—that is, the mechanism by which metals plastically deform (Section 7.4). Slipoccurs on the most densely packed crystallographic planes and, in those planes,along directions having the greatest atomic packing. 3.12 CLOSE-PACKED CRYSTAL STRUCTURES You may remember from the discussion on metallic crystal structures that bothface-centered cubic and hexagonal close-packed crystal structures have atomicpacking factors of 0.74, which is the most efficient packing of equal-sized spheresor atoms. In addition to unit cell representations, these two crystal structures maybe described in terms of close-packed planes of atoms (i.e., planes having a maxi-mum atom or sphere-packing density); a portion of one such plane is illustrated inFigure 3.13a. Both crystal structures may be generated by the stacking of theseclose-packed planes on top of one another; the difference between the two struc-tures lies in the stacking sequence. Let the centers of all the atoms in one close-packed plane be labeled A. Asso- ciated with this plane are two sets of equivalent triangular depressions formed bythree adjacent atoms, into which the next close-packed plane of atoms may rest.Those having the triangle vertex pointing up are arbitrarily designated as Bposi- tions, while the remaining depressions are those with the down vertices, which aremarked Cin Figure 3.13a.PD110/H110052 atoms 8R212/H110051 4R21214R 212R12 2/H110058R212,2R12nm/H110022, m/H110022PD/H11005number of atoms centered on a plane area of plane3.12 Close-Packed Crystal Structures •61 Figure 3.12 (a) Reduced- sphere FCC unit cell with the [110] directionindicated.

Single crystals exist in nature, but they may also be produced artifi- cially. They are ordinarily difficult to grow, because the environment must be care-fully controlled. If the extremities of a single crystal are permitted to grow without any exter- nal constraint, the crystal will assume a regular geometric shape having flat faces,as with some of the gem stones; the shape is indicative of the crystal structure. Aphotograph of a garnet single crystal is shown in Figure 3.16. Within the past fewyears, single crystals have become extremely important in many of our modern tech-nologies, in particular electronic microcircuits, which employ single crystals of sili-con and other semiconductors. 3.14 POLYCRYSTALLINE MATERIALS Most crystalline solids are composed of a collection of many small crystals or grains; such materials are termed polycrystalline. Various stages in the solidification of a polycrystalline specimen are represented schematically in Figure 3.17.

Figure 3.17. Initially, smallcrystals or nuclei form at various positions. These have random crystallographic ori-entations, as indicated by the square grids. The small grains grow by the successiveaddition from the surrounding liquid of atoms to the structure of each. The ex-tremities of adjacent grains impinge on one another as the solidification process ap-proaches completion. As indicated in Figure 3.17, the crystallographic orientationvaries from grain to grain. Also, there exists some atomic mismatch within the re-gion where two grains meet; this area, called a grain boundary, is discussed in more detail in Section 4.6. 3.15 ANISOTROPY The physical properties of single crystals of some substances depend on the crys-tallographic direction in which measurements are taken. For example, the elasticmodulus, the electrical conductivity, and the index of refraction may have differentvalues in the [100] and [111] directions. This directionality of properties is termedanisotropy, and it is associated with the variance of atomic or ionic spacing with crystallographic direction. Substances in which measured properties are independ-ent of the direction of measurement are isotropic.

Table 3.3. For many polycrystalline materials, the crystallographic orientations of the indi- vidual grains are totally random. Under these circumstances, even though each grainmay be anisotropic, a specimen composed of the grain aggregate behaves isotropically.Also, the magnitude of a measured property represents some average of the directionalvalues. Sometimes the grains in polycrystalline materials have a preferential crystallo-graphic orientation, in which case the material is said to have a “texture.” The magnetic properties of some iron alloys used in transformer cores are anisotropic—that is, grains (or single crystals) magnetize in a 81009 -type direction easier than any other crystallographic direction. Energy losses in transformer coresare minimized by utilizing polycrystalline sheets of these alloys into which havebeen introduced a “magnetic texture”: most of the grains in each sheet have a3.15 Anisotropy •65 Figure 3.17 Schematic diagrams of the various stages in the solidification of a polycrystalline material; the square grids depict unit cells.

We will now givea brief overview of the diffraction phenomenon and how, using x-rays, atomicinterplanar distances and crystal structures are deduced. The Diffraction Phenomenon Diffraction occurs when a wave encounters a series of regularly spaced obstaclesthat (1) are capable of scattering the wave, and (2) have spacings that are compa-rable in magnitude to the wavelength. Furthermore, diffraction is a consequence ofspecific phase relationships established between two or more waves that have beenscattered by the obstacles. Consider waves 1 and 2 in Figure 3.18 awhich have the same wavelength and are in phase at point . Now let us suppose that both waves are scatteredin such a way that they traverse different paths. The phase relationship betweenthe scattered waves, which will depend upon the difference in path length, is im-portant. One possibility results when this path length difference is an integral num-ber of wavelengths. As noted in Figure 3.18 a, these scattered waves (now labeled and ) are still in phase. They are said to mutually reinforce (or constructively interfere with) one another; and, when amplitudes are added, the wave shown onthe right side of the figure results. This is a manifestation of diffraction, and we re- fer to a diffracted beam as one composed of a large number of scattered waves thatmutually reinforce one another. Other phase relationships are possible between scattered waves that will not lead to this mutual reinforcement.

mutual reinforcement. The other extreme is that demonstrated inFigure 3.18 b, wherein the path length difference after scattering is some integral number of half wavelengths. The scattered waves are out of phase—that is, corre- sponding amplitudes cancel or annul one another, or destructively interfere (i.e., the2¿ 1¿O–O ¿1l266 •Chapter 3 / The Structure of Crystalline Solids diffractionTable 3.3 Modulus of Elasticity Values forSeveral Metals at Various Crystallo- graphic Orientations Modulus of Elasticity (GPa) Metal [100][ 110][ 111] Aluminum 63.7 72.6 76.1 Copper 66.7 130.3 191.1 Iron 125.0 210.5 272.7 Tungsten 384.6 384.6 384.6 Source: R.

Of course, phase relationships intermediate between these two extremesexist, resulting in only partial reinforcement. X-Ray Diffraction and Bragg’s Law X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation that have high energies and shortwavelengths—wavelengths on the order of the atomic spacings for solids. When abeam of x-rays impinges on a solid material, a portion of this beam will be scatteredin all directions by the electrons associated with each atom or ion that lies withinthe beam’s path. Let us now examine the necessary conditions for diffraction ofx-rays by a periodic arrangement of atoms. Consider the two parallel planes of atoms and in Figure 3.19, which have the same h,k, and lMiller indices and are separated by the interplanar spac- ing .

exceeding unity. Thus, we have a simple expression relating the x-ray wavelength and interatomic spacing to the angle of the diffracted beam. If Bragg’s law is not satisfied, then the interfer-ence will be nonconstructive in nature so as to yield a very low-intensity diffractedbeam. The magnitude of the distance between two adjacent and parallel planes of atoms (i.e., the interplanar spacing ) is a function of the Miller indices ( h,k, andl) as well as the lattice parameter(s). For example, for crystal structures that have cubic symmetry, (3.14) in which a is the lattice parameter (unit cell edge length). Relationships similar to Equation 3.14, but more complex, exist for the other six crystal systems noted inTable 3.2. Bragg’s law, Equation 3.13, is a necessary but not sufficient condition for dif- fraction by real crystals. It specifies when diffraction will occur for unit cells hav-ing atoms positioned only at cell corners. However, atoms situated at other sites(e.g., face and interior unit cell positions as with FCC and BCC) act as extra scat-tering centers, which can produce out-of-phase scattering at certain Bragg angles.The net result is the absence of some diffracted beams that, according to Equation3.13, should be present. For example, for the BCC crystal structure, mustbe even if diffraction is to occur, whereas for FCC, h,k, and lmust all be either odd or even.h/H11001k/H11001ld hkl/H11005a 2h2/H11001k2/H11001l2dhklsin u /H110052dhkl sin u nl/H11005dhkl sin u /H11001dhkl sin u68 •Chapter 3 / The Structure of Crystalline Solids Bragg’s law— relationship amongx-ray wavelength,interatomic spacing,and angle ofdiffraction forconstructiveinterference Interplanar separation for aplane having indicesh,k, and lBragg’s lawFigure 3.19 Diffraction of x-rays by planes of atoms ( ).

Why? [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Diffraction Techniques One common diffraction technique employs a powdered or polycrystalline speci-men consisting of many fine and randomly oriented particles that are exposed tomonochromatic x-radiation. Each powder particle (or grain) is a crystal, and havinga large number of them with random orientations ensures that some particles areproperly oriented such that every possible set of crystallographic planes will beavailable for diffraction. The diffractometer is an apparatus used to determine the angles at which dif- fraction occurs for powdered specimens; its features are represented schematicallyin Figure 3.20. A specimen S in the form of a flat plate is supported so that rota-tions about the axis labeled O are possible; this axis is perpendicular to the planeof the page. The monochromatic x-ray beam is generated at point T, and the inten-sities of diffracted beams are detected with a counter labeled C in the figure. Thespecimen, x-ray source, and counter are all coplanar. The counter is mounted on a movable carriage that may also be rotated about the O axis; its angular position in terms of is marked on a graduated scale.

graduated scale. 4Car- riage and specimen are mechanically coupled such that a rotation of the specimenthrough is accompanied by a rotation of the counter; this assures that the in-cident and reflection angles are maintained equal to one another (Figure 3.20).2u u2u3.16 X-Ray Diffraction: Determination of Crystal Structures •69 O /H9258 2/H9258S T C160° 140° 120° 100° 80°60°40°20°0°Figure 3.20 Schematic diagram of an x-ray diffractometer; T /H11005 x-ray source, S/H11005specimen, C /H11005detector, and O /H11005 the axis around which the specimen and detector rotate. 4 Note that the symbol has been used in two different contexts for this discussion. Here, represents the angular locations of both x-ray source and counter relative to the speci- men surface. Previously (e.g., Equation 3.13), it denoted the angle at which the Braggcriterion for diffraction is satisfied.uu1496T_c03_38-79 11/11/05 19:05 Page 69REVISED PAGESCollimators are incorporated within the beam path to produce a well-defined and focused beam. Utilization of a filter provides a near-monochromatic beam. As the counter moves at constant angular velocity, a recorder automatically plots the diffracted beam intensity (monitored by the counter) as a function of is termed the diffraction angle, which is measured experimentally. Figure 3.21 shows a diffraction pattern for a powdered specimen of lead. The high-intensitypeaks result when the Bragg diffraction condition is satisfied by some set of crys-tallographic planes. These peaks are plane-indexed in the figure. Other powder techniques have been devised wherein diffracted beam intensity and position are recorded on a photographic film instead of being measured by a counter.

a counter. One of the primary uses of x-ray diffractometry is for the determination of crys- tal structure. The unit cell size and geometry may be resolved from the angular po-sitions of the diffraction peaks, whereas arrangement of atoms within the unit cellis associated with the relative intensities of these peaks. X-rays, as well as electron and neutron beams, are also used in other types of material investigations. For example, crystallographic orientations of single crystalsare possible using x-ray diffraction (or Laue) photographs. In the ( a) chapter-opening photograph for this chapter is shown a photograph that was generated using an in-cident x-ray beam that was directed on a magnesium crystal; each spot (with theexception of the darkest one near the center) resulted from an x-ray beam that wasdiffracted by a specific set of crystallographic planes. Other uses of x-rays includequalitative and quantitative chemical identifications and the determination of residualstresses and crystal size.

Sometimes such ma- terials are also called amorphous (meaning literally without form), or supercooled liquids, inasmuch as their atomic structure resembles that of a liquid. An amorphous condition may be illustrated by comparison of the crystalline and noncrystalline structures of the ceramic compound silicon dioxide (SiO 2), which may exist in both states. Figures 3.22 aand 3.22b present two-dimensional schematic diagrams for both structures of SiO 2. Even though each silicon ion bonds to three oxygen ions for both states, beyond this, the structure is much more disordered andirregular for the noncrystalline structure. Whether a crystalline or amorphous solid forms depends on the ease with which a random atomic structure in the liquid can transform to an ordered state duringsolidification. Amorphous materials, therefore, are characterized by atomic or mo-lecular structures that are relatively complex and become ordered only with somedifficulty. Furthermore, rapidly cooling through the freezing temperature favors theformation of a noncrystalline solid, since little time is allowed for the orderingprocess. Metals normally form crystalline solids, but some ceramic materials are crystalline, whereas others, the inorganic glasses, are amorphous.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] SUMMARY Fundamental ConceptsUnit Cells Atoms in crystalline solids are positioned in orderly and repeated patterns that are in contrast to the random and disordered atomic distribution found in noncrys-talline or amorphous materials. Atoms may be represented as solid spheres, and,for crystalline solids, crystal structure is just the spatial arrangement of these spheres.The various crystal structures are specified in terms of parallelepiped unit cells,which are characterized by geometry and atom positions within. Metallic Crystal Structures Most common metals exist in at least one of three relatively simple crystal struc- tures: face-centered cubic (FCC), body-centered cubic (BCC), and hexagonal close-packed (HCP). Two features of a crystal structure are coordination number (ornumber of nearest-neighbor atoms) and atomic packing factor (the fraction of solidsphere volume in the unit cell). Coordination number and atomic packing factorare the same for both FCC and HCP crystal structures, each of which may be gen-erated by the stacking of close-packed planes of atoms. Point Coordinates Crystallographic DirectionsCrystallographic Planes Crystallographic points, directions, and planes are specified in terms of indexing schemes. The basis for the determination of each index is a coordinate axis systemdefined by the unit cell for the particular crystal structure.

crystal structure. The location of a pointwithin a unit cell is specified using coordinates that are fractional multiples of thecell edge lengths. Directional indices are computed in terms of the vector projectionon each of the coordinate axes, whereas planar indices are determined from the re-ciprocals of axial intercepts. For hexagonal unit cells, a four-index scheme for bothdirections and planes is found to be more convenient. Linear and Planar Densities Crystallographic directional and planar equivalencies are related to atomic linear and planar densities, respectively.The atomic packing (i.e., planar density) of spheres72 •Chapter 3 / The Structure of Crystalline Solids 1496T_c03_38-79 11/11/05 19:05 Page 72REVISED PAGESin a crystallographic plane depends on the indices of the plane as well as the crys- tal structure. For a given crystal structure, planes having identical atomic packingyet different Miller indices belong to the same family. Single Crystals Polycrystalline Materials Single crystals are materials in which the atomic order extends uninterrupted over the entirety of the specimen; under some circumstances, they may have flat facesand regular geometric shapes. The vast majority of crystalline solids, however, arepolycrystalline, being composed of many small crystals or grains having differentcrystallographic orientations. Crystal Systems Polymorphism and AllotropyAnisotropy Other concepts introduced in this chapter were: crystal system (a classification scheme for crystal structures on the basis of unit cell geometry), polymorphism (orallotropy) (when a specific material can have more than one crystal structure), andanisotropy (the directionality dependence of properties). X-Ray Diffraction: Determination of Crystal Structures X-ray diffractometry is used for crystal structure and interplanar spacing determi- nations. A beam of x-rays directed on a crystalline material may experience dif-fraction (constructive interference) as a result of its interaction with a series ofparallel atomic planes according to Bragg’s law.

Consequently,it is important to have a knowledge about the types ofimperfections that exist and the roles they play in af-fecting the behavior of materials. For example, the me-chanical properties of pure metals experience significantalterations when alloyed (i.e., when impurity atoms areadded)—for example, brass (70% copper–30% zinc) ismuch harder and stronger than pure copper (Section7.9). Also, integrated circuit microelectronic devices found in our computers, calculators, and home appli-ances function because of highly controlled concen-trations of specific impurities that are incorporatedinto small, localized regions of semiconducting materi-als (Sections 18.11 and 18.15).

However, such an idealized solid does not exist; allcontain large numbers of various defects or imperfections. As a matter of fact, many of the properties of materials are profoundly sensitive to deviations from crystallineperfection; the influence is not always adverse, and often specific characteristics aredeliberately fashioned by the introduction of controlled amounts or numbers ofparticular defects, as detailed in succeeding chapters. By “crystalline defect” is meant a lattice irregularity having one or more of its dimensions on the order of an atomic diameter. Classification of crystalline imper-fections is frequently made according to geometry or dimensionality of the defect.Several different imperfections are discussed in this chapter, including point defects (those associated with one or two atomic positions), linear (or one-dimensional)defects, as well as interfacial defects, or boundaries, which are two-dimensional.Impurities in solids are also discussed, since impurity atoms may exist as pointdefects. Finally, techniques for the microscopic examination of defects and thestructure of materials are briefly described.

briefly described. Point Defects 4.2 VACANCIES AND SELF-INTERSTITIALS The simplest of the point defects is a vacancy, or vacant lattice site, one normally occupied from which an atom is missing (Figure 4.1). All crystalline solids containvacancies and, in fact, it is not possible to create such a material that is free of thesedefects. The necessity of the existence of vacancies is explained using principles ofthermodynamics; in essence, the presence of vacancies increases the entropy (i.e.,the randomness) of the crystal. The equilibrium number of vacancies for a given quantity of material depends on and increases with temperature according to (4.1) N v/H11005N exp a /H11002Qv kTbNvLearning Objectives After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1.Describe both vacancy and self-interstitial crys- talline defects. 2.Calculate the equilibrium number of vacanciesin a material at some specified temperature,given the relevant constants. 3.Name the two types of solid solutions, and pro-vide a brief written definition and/or schematicsketch of each. 4.Given the masses and atomic weights of two ormore elements in a metal alloy, calculate theweight percent and atom percent for eachelement.5.For each of edge, screw, and mixed dislocations: (a) describe and make a drawing of the dislocation.

For most metals, the fraction of vacancies just below the melting temperature is on the order of ; that is, one lattice site out of 10,000 will be empty. As ensuing discussions indicate, a num-ber of other material parameters have an exponential dependence on temperaturesimilar to that of Equation 4.1. A self-interstitial is an atom from the crystal that is crowded into an intersti- tial site, a small void space that under ordinary circumstances is not occupied. Thiskind of defect is also represented in Figure 4.1. In metals, a self-interstitial intro-duces relatively large distortions in the surrounding lattice because the atom is sub-stantially larger than the interstitial position in which it is situated. Consequently,the formation of this defect is not highly probable, and it exists in very small con-centrations, which are significantly lower than for vacancies. EXAMPLE PROBLEM 4.1 Number of Vacancies Computation at a Specified Temperature Calculate the equilibrium number of vacancies per cubic meter for copper at C.

In fact, even with relatively sophisticated techniques, it is difficult to refinemetals to a purity in excess of 99.9999%. At this level, on the order of to impurity atoms will be present in one cubic meter of material. Most familiar met-als are not highly pure; rather, they are alloys, in which impurity atoms have been added intentionally to impart specific characteristics to the material. Ordinarily, al-loying is used in metals to improve mechanical strength and corrosion resistance.For example, sterling silver is a 92.5% silver % copper alloy.

copper alloy. In normal ambientenvironments, pure silver is highly corrosion resistant, but also very soft. Alloyingwith copper significantly enhances the mechanical strength without depreciating thecorrosion resistance appreciably. The addition of impurity atoms to a metal will result in the formation of a solid solution and/or a new second phase, depending on the kinds of impurity, their con- centrations, and the temperature of the alloy. The present discussion is concernedwith the notion of a solid solution; treatment of the formation of a new phase isdeferred to Chapter 9. Several terms relating to impurities and solid solutions deserve mention. With regard to alloys, solute and solvent are terms that are commonly employed. “Solvent” represents the element or compound that is present in the greatest amount; onoccasion, solvent atoms are also called host atoms. “Solute” is used to denote anelement or compound present in a minor concentration. Solid Solutions A solid solution forms when, as the solute atoms are added to the host material,the crystal structure is maintained, and no new structures are formed.

Interstitial impurity atomSubstitutional impurity atom useful to draw an analogy with a liquid solution. If two liquids, soluble in each other (such as water and alcohol) are combined, a liquid solution is produced as themolecules intermix, and its composition is homogeneous throughout. A solid solu-tion is also compositionally homogeneous; the impurity atoms are randomly anduniformly dispersed within the solid. Impurity point defects are found in solid solutions, of which there are two types: substitutional and interstitial. For the substitutional type, solute or impurity atoms replace or substitute for the host atoms (Figure 4.2). There are several features ofthe solute and solvent atoms that determine the degree to which the former dis-solves in the latter, as follows: 1.Atomic size factor. Appreciable quantities of a solute may be accommo-dated in this type of solid solution only when the difference in atomicradii between the two atom types is less than about . Otherwisethe solute atoms will create substantial lattice distortions and a new phasewill form. 2.Crystal structure. For appreciable solid solubility the crystal structures formetals of both atom types must be the same. 3.Electronegativity. The more electropositive one element and the more elec-tronegative the other, the greater is the likelihood that they will form anintermetallic compound instead of a substitutional solid solution. 4.Valences. Other factors being equal, a metal will have more of a tendency todissolve another metal of higher valency than one of a lower valency.

lower valency. An example of a substitutional solid solution is found for copper and nickel. These two elements are completely soluble in one another at all proportions. With regard to the aforementioned rules that govern degree of solubility, the atomic radiifor copper and nickel are 0.128 and 0.125 nm, respectively, both have the FCC crys-tal structure, and their electronegativities are 1.9 and 1.8 (Figure 2.7); finally, themost common valences are for copper (although it sometimes can be ) and for nickel. For interstitial solid solutions, impurity atoms fill the voids or interstices among the host atoms (see Figure 4.2). For metallic materials that have relatively highatomic packing factors, these interstitial positions are relatively small. Consequently,/H110012/H110012 /H110011/H1100615%84 •Chapter 4 / Imperfections in Solids substitutional solid solution interstitial solid solution1496T_c04_80-108 11/14/05 9:53 Page 84REVISED PAGESthe atomic diameter of an interstitial impurity must be substantially smaller than that of the host atoms. Normally, the maximum allowable concentration of inter-stitial impurity atoms is low (less than 10%). Even very small impurity atoms areordinarily larger than the interstitial sites, and as a consequence they introduce somelattice strains on the adjacent host atoms. Problem 4.5 calls for determination ofthe radii of impurity atoms (in terms of R, the host atom radius) that will just fit into interstitial positions without introducing any lattice strains for both FCC andBCC crystal structures. Carbon forms an interstitial solid solution when added to iron; the maximum concentration of carbon is about 2%. The atomic radius of the carbon atom is muchless than that for iron: 0.071 nm versus 0.124 nm. Solid solutions are also possiblefor ceramic materials, as discussed in Section 12.5.

Section 12.5. 4.4 SPECIFICATION OF COMPOSITION It is often necessary to express the composition (or concentration)3of an alloy in terms of its constituent elements. The two most common ways to specify composi-tion are weight (or mass) percent and atom percent. The basis for weight percent (wt%) is the weight of a particular element relative to the total alloy weight. Foran alloy that contains two hypothetical atoms denoted by 1 and 2, the concentra-tion of 1 in wt%, is defined as (4.3) where and represent the weight (or mass) of elements 1 and 2, respectively.The concentration of 2 would be computed in an analogous manner. The basis for atom percent (at%) calculations is the number of moles of an el- ement in relation to the total moles of the elements in the alloy. The number ofmoles in some specified mass of a hypothetical element 1, may be computedas follows: (4.4) Here, and denote the mass (in grams) and atomic weight, respectively, forelement 1. Concentration in terms of atom percent of element 1 in an alloy containing 1 and 2 atoms, is defined by 4 (4.5) In like manner, the atom percent of 2 may be determined.C¿1/H11005nm1 nm1/H11001nm2/H11003100C¿1,A1 m¿1nm1/H11005m1¿ A1nm1,m2 m1C1/H11005m1 m1/H11001m2/H11003100C1,4.4 Specification of Composition •85 composition weight percent Computation of weight percent (for atwo-element alloy) atom percent Computation of atom percent (for atwo-element alloy) 3The terms composition and concentration will be assumed to have the same meaning in this book (i.e., the relative content of a specific element or constituent in an alloy) and will be used interchangeably.

used interchangeably. 4In order to avoid confusion in notations and symbols that are being used in this section, we should point out that the prime (as in and ) is used to designate both composi-tion, in atom percent, as well as mass of material in units of grams.m¿ 1 C¿11496T_c04_80-108 11/14/05 9:53 Page 85REVISED PAGESAtom percent computations also can be carried out on the basis of the num- ber of atoms instead of moles, since one mole of all substances contains the same number of atoms. Composition Conversions Sometimes it is necessary to convert from one composition scheme to another—for example, from weight percent to atom percent. We will now present equationsfor making these conversions in terms of the two hypothetical elements 1 and 2.Using the convention of the previous section (i.e., weight percents denoted by and atom percents by and and atomic weights as and ), these con-version expressions are as follows: (4.6a) (4.6b) (4.7a) (4.7b) Since we are considering only two elements, computations involving the pre- ceding equations are simplified when it is realized that (4.8a) (4.8b) In addition, it sometimes becomes necessary to convert concentration from weight percent to mass of one component per unit volume of material (i.e., fromunits of wt% to kg/m 3); this latter composition scheme is often used in diffu- sion computations (Section 5.3). Concentrations in terms of this basis will be de-noted using a double prime (i.e., and ), and the relevant equations are asfollows: (4.9a) (4.9b) For density in units of g/cm 3, these expressions yield and in kg/m3.

One type of dislocation is represented in Figure 4.3: an extra por- tion of a plane of atoms, or half-plane, the edge of which terminates within thecrystal. This is termed an edge dislocation; it is a linear defect that centers around the line that is defined along the end of the extra half-plane of atoms.

Within the region around the dislocation line there is some localized lattice distortion.

extra half-plane. The magnitude of this distortion decreases with distance awayfrom the dislocation line; at positions far removed, the crystal lattice is virtually per-fect. Sometimes the edge dislocation in Figure 4.3 is represented by the symbol which also indicates the position of the dislocation line. An edge dislocation mayalso be formed by an extra half-plane of atoms that is included in the bottom por-tion of the crystal; its designation is a Another type of dislocation, called a screw dislocation, exists, which may be thought of as being formed by a shear stress that is applied to produce the distor-tion shown in Figure 4.4 a: the upper front region of the crystal is shifted one atomic distance to the right relative to the bottom portion. The atomic distortion associ-ated with a screw dislocation is also linear and along a dislocation line, line ABin Figure 4.4b. The screw dislocation derives its name from the spiral or helical pathor ramp that is traced around the dislocation line by the atomic planes of atoms.Sometimes the symbol is used to designate a screw dislocation. Most dislocations found in crystalline materials are probably neither pure edge nor pure screw, but exhibit components of both types; these are termed mixed dis- locations. All three dislocation types are represented schematically in Figure 4.5; the lattice distortion that is produced away from the two faces is mixed, having vary-ing degrees of screw and edge character. The magnitude and direction of the lattice distortion associated with a dislo- cation is expressed in terms of a Burgers vector, denoted by a b. Burgers vectors are indicated in Figures 4.3 and 4.4 for edge and screw dislocations, respectively.Furthermore, the nature of a dislocation (i.e., edge, screw, or mixed) is defined bythe relative orientations of dislocation line and Burgers vector. For an edge, theyare perpendicular (Figure 4.3), whereas for a screw, they are parallel (Figure 4.4);they are neither perpendicular nor parallel for a mixed dislocation.

mixed dislocation. Also, eventhough a dislocation changes direction and nature within a crystal (e.g., from edgeto mixed to screw), the Burgers vector will be the same at all points along its line.For example, all positions of the curved dislocation in Figure 4.5 will have the Burgersvector shown. For metallic materials, the Burgers vector for a dislocation will pointin a close-packed crystallographic direction and will be of magnitude equal to theinteratomic spacing./H11477./H11036,4.5 Dislocations—Linear Defects •89 Figure 4.3 The atom positions around an edge dislocation; extra half-plane of atoms shown in perspective.

In addition, the Burgers vector is an element of the theory that has been developed to explain this type of deformation. Dislocations can be observed in crystalline materials using electron-microscopic techniques. In Figure 4.6, a high-magnification transmission electron micrograph,the dark lines are the dislocations. Virtually all crystalline materials contain some dislocations that were intro- duced during solidification, during plastic deformation, and as a consequence ofthermal stresses that result from rapid cooling. Dislocations are involved in the plas-tic deformation of crystalline materials, both metals and ceramics, as discussed inChapters 7 and 12. They have also been observed in polymeric materials, and arediscussed in Section 14.13. 4.6 INTERFACIAL DEFECTS Interfacial defects are boundaries that have two dimensions and normally separateregions of the materials that have different crystal structures and/or crystallographicorientations. These imperfections include external surfaces, grain boundaries, twinboundaries, stacking faults, and phase boundaries. External Surfaces One of the most obvious boundaries is the external surface, along which the crys-tal structure terminates.

structure terminates. Surface atoms are not bonded to the maximum number ofnearest neighbors, and are therefore in a higher energy state than the atoms at in-terior positions. The bonds of these surface atoms that are not satisfied give rise to asurface energy, expressed in units of energy per unit area (J/m 2or erg/cm2). To re- duce this energy, materials tend to minimize, if at all possible, the total surface area.For example, liquids assume a shape having a minimum area—the droplets becomespherical. Of course, this is not possible with solids, which are mechanically rigid. Grain Boundaries Another interfacial defect, the grain boundary, was introduced in Section 3.14 as theboundary separating two small grains or crystals having different crystallographic92 •Chapter 4 / Imperfections in Solids Figure 4.6 A transmission electron micrograph of a titanium alloy in which the dark lines are dislocations. (Courtesy of M. R. Plichta, MichiganTechnological University.)51,450/H11003. 1496T_c04_80-108 11/14/05 9:53 Page 92REVISED PAGESorientations in polycrystalline materials.A grain boundary is represented schemat- ically from an atomic perspective in Figure 4.7. Within the boundary region,which is probably just several atom distances wide, there is some atomic mis-match in a transition from the crystalline orientation of one grain to that of anadjacent one. Various degrees of crystallographic misalignment between adjacent grains are possible (Figure 4.7). When this orientation mismatch is slight, on the order of afew degrees, then the term small- (or low - ) angle grain boundary is used. These boundaries can be described in terms of dislocation arrays. One simple small-angle grain boundary is formed when edge dislocations are aligned in the mannerof Figure 4.8. This type is called a tilt boundary; the angle of misorientation, is also indicated in the figure.

the figure. When the angle of misorientation is parallel to theboundary, a twist boundary results, which can be described by an array of screw dislocations. The atoms are bonded less regularly along a grain boundary (e.g., bond angles are longer), and consequently, there is an interfacial or grain boundary energy sim-ilar to the surface energy described above. The magnitude of this energy is a func-tion of the degree of misorientation, being larger for high-angle boundaries. Grainboundaries are more chemically reactive than the grains themselves as a conse-quence of this boundary energy. Furthermore, impurity atoms often preferentiallysegregate along these boundaries because of their higher energy state. The total in-terfacial energy is lower in large or coarse-grained materials than in fine-grainedones, since there is less total boundary area in the former. Grains grow at elevatedtemperatures to reduce the total boundary energy, a phenomenon explained inSection 7.13. In spite of this disordered arrangement of atoms and lack of regular bonding along grain boundaries, a polycrystalline material is still very strong; cohesive forceswithin and across the boundary are present. Furthermore, the density of a poly-crystalline specimen is virtually identical to that of a single crystal of the samematerial.u,4.6 Interfacial Defects •93 Figure 4.7 Schematic diagram showing small- and high-angle grainboundaries and theadjacent atom positions.

(Figure 4.9). The region ofmaterial between these boundaries is appropriately termed a twin.Twins result from atomic displacements that are produced from applied mechanical shear forces(mechanical twins), and also during annealing heat treatments following deforma-tion (annealing twins). Twinning occurs on a definite crystallographic plane and ina specific direction, both of which depend on the crystal structure. Annealing twinsare typically found in metals that have the FCC crystal structure, while mechanicaltwins are observed in BCC and HCP metals. The role of mechanical twins in thedeformation process is discussed in Section 7.7. Annealing twins may be observed94 •Chapter 4 / Imperfections in Solids Figure 4.8 Demonstration of how a tilt boundary having an angle of misorientation results from an alignment of edge dislocations.u Figure 4.9 Schematic diagram showing a twin plane or boundaryand the adjacent atom positions(colored circles)./H9258b Twin plane (boundary)1496T_c04_80-108 11/14/05 9:53 Page 94REVISED PAGES4.6 Interfacial Defects •95 Catalysts (and Surface Defects)MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE Acatalyst is a substance that speeds up the rate of a chemical reaction without participating in the reaction itself (i.e., it is not consumed). One type of catalyst exists as a solid; reactant moleculesin a gas or liquid phase are adsorbed 5onto the cat- alytic surface, at which point some type of interac-tion occurs that promotes an increase in theirchemical reactivity rate. Adsorption sites on a catalyst are normally sur- face defects associated with planes of atoms; an in-teratomic/intermolecular bond is formed betweena defect site and an adsorbed molecular species.Several types of surface defects, representedschematically in Figure 4.10, include ledges, kinks,terraces, vacancies, and individual adatoms (i.e.,atoms adsorbed on the surface).

the surface). One important use of catalysts is in catalytic converters on automobiles, which reduce the emis-sion of exhaust gas pollutants such as carbonmonoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO x, where xis variable), and unburned hydrocarbons. Air is in-troduced into the exhaust emissions from the au-tomobile engine; this mixture of gases then passesover the catalyst, which adsorbs on its surface mol-ecules of CO, NO x, and O 2. The NO xdissociates into N and O atoms, whereas the O 2dissociates into its atomic species. Pairs of nitrogen atomscombine to form N 2molecules, and carbonmonoxide is oxidized to form carbon dioxide (CO 2). Furthermore, any unburned hydrocarbons are alsooxidized to CO 2and H 2O. One of the materials used as a catalyst in this application is (Ce 0.5Zr0.5)O2. Figure 4.11 is a high- resolution transmission electron micrograph, whichshows several single crystals of this material. Indi-vidual atoms are resolved in this micrograph as wellas some of the defects presented in Figure 4.10.These surface defects act as adsorption sites for theatomic and molecular species noted in the previousparagraph. Consequently, dissociation, combina-tion, and oxidation reactions involving these speciesare facilitated, such that the content of pollutantspecies (CO, NO x, and unburned hydrocarbons) in the exhaust gas stream is reduced significantly. 5Adsorption is the adhesion of molecules of a gas or liquid to a solid surface. It should not be confused with absorption which is the assimilation of molecules into a solid or liquid.Figure 4.10 Schematic representations of surface defects that are potential adsorption sites for catalysis.

The twins correspond to those regions having relatively straight and parallel sides and a different visual contrast than the untwinned regions of the grains within whichthey reside. An explanation for the variety of textural contrasts in this photomi-crograph is provided in Section 4.10. Miscellaneous Interfacial Defects Other possible interfacial defects include stacking faults, phase boundaries, and fer-romagnetic domain walls. Stacking faults are found in FCC metals when there is aninterruption in the ABCABCABC . . . stacking sequence of close-packed planes (Section 3.12). Phase boundaries exist in multiphase materials (Section 9.3) acrosswhich there is a sudden change in physical and/or chemical characteristics.

chemical characteristics. For fer-romagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials, the boundary that separates regions hav-ing different directions of magnetization is termed a domain wall, which is discussedin Section 20.7. Associated with each of the defects discussed in this section is an interfacial en- ergy, the magnitude of which depends on boundary type, and which will vary frommaterial to material. Normally, the interfacial energy will be greatest for externalsurfaces and least for domain walls. Concept Check 4.1 The surface energy of a single crystal depends on crystallographic orientation. Doesthis surface energy increase or decrease with an increase in planar density. Why? [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 4.7 BULK OR VOLUME DEFECTS Other defects exist in all solid materials that are much larger than those heretoforediscussed. These include pores, cracks, foreign inclusions, and other phases. Theyare normally introduced during processing and fabrication steps. Some of these de-fects and their effects on the properties of materials are discussed in subsequentchapters. 4.8 ATOMIC VIBRATIONS Every atom in a solid material is vibrating very rapidly about its lattice positionwithin the crystal. In a sense, these atomic vibrations may be thought of as imper- fections or defects. At any instant of time not all atoms vibrate at the same fre-quency and amplitude, nor with the same energy. At a given temperature there willexist a distribution of energies for the constituent atoms about an average energy.Over time the vibrational energy of any specific atom will also vary in a randommanner.With rising temperature, this average energy increases, and, in fact, the tem-perature of a solid is really just a measure of the average vibrational activity ofatoms and molecules. At room temperature, a typical vibrational frequency is onthe order of vibrations per second, whereas the amplitude is a few thousandthsof a nanometer.

a nanometer. Many properties and processes in solids are manifestations of this vibrational atomic motion. For example, melting occurs when the vibrations are vigorous enoughto rupture large numbers of atomic bonds. A more detailed discussion of atomic vi-brations and their influence on the properties of materials is presented in Chapter 19.10 13atomic vibration1496T_c04_80-108 11/14/05 9:53 Page 96REVISED PAGESMicroscopic Examination 4.9 GENERAL On occasion it is necessary or desirable to examine the structural elements and de- fects that influence the properties of materials. Some structural elements are ofmacroscopic dimensions; that is, they are large enough to be observed with the un- aided eye. For example, the shape and average size or diameter of the grains for apolycrystalline specimen are important structural characteristics. Macroscopicgrains are often evident on aluminum streetlight posts and also on highway guardrails. Relatively large grains having different textures are clearly visible on the sur-face of the sectioned lead ingot shown in Figure 4.12. However, in most materialsthe constituent grains are of microscopic dimensions, having diameters that may be on the order of microns, 6and their details must be investigated using some type of microscope. Grain size and shape are only two features of what is termed themicrostructure; these and other microstructural characteristics are discussed in sub- sequent chapters. Optical, electron, and scanning probe microscopes are commonly used in microscopy. These instruments aid in investigations of the microstructural features of all material types. Some of these techniques employ photographic equipment inconjunction with the microscope; the photograph on which the image is recordedis called a photomicrograph. In addition, many microstructural images are com- puter generated and/or enhanced. Microscopic examination is an extremely useful tool in the study and charac- terization of materials. Several important applications of microstructural exami-nations are as follows: to ensure that the associations between the properties andstructure (and defects) are properly understood, to predict the properties of ma-terials once these relationships have been established, to design alloys with newproperty combinations, to determine whether or not a material has been correctlyheat treated, and to ascertain the mode of mechanical fracture.

mechanical fracture. Several techniquesthat are commonly used in such investigations are discussed next.4.9 General •97 microstructure microscopy photomicrograph 6A micron ( ), sometimes called a micrometer, is m. 10/H110026/H9262mFigure 4.12 High-purity polycrystalline lead ingot in which the individual grains may bediscerned.

For materials thatare opaque to visible light (all metals and many ceramics and polymers), onlythe surface is subject to observation, and the light microscope must be used in areflecting mode. Contrasts in the image produced result from differences inreflectivity of the various regions of the microstructure. Investigations of thistype are often termed metallographic, since metals were first examined using this technique. Normally, careful and meticulous surface preparations are necessary to reveal the important details of the microstructure. The specimen surface must first beground and polished to a smooth and mirrorlike finish. This is accomplished by us-ing successively finer abrasive papers and powders. The microstructure is revealedby a surface treatment using an appropriate chemical reagent in a procedure termedetching. The chemical reactivity of the grains of some single-phase materials de-pends on crystallographic orientation. Consequently, in a polycrystalline specimen,etching characteristics vary from grain to grain.

to grain. Figure 4.13 bshows how normally incident light is reflected by three etched surface grains, each having a different ori-entation. Figure 4.13 adepicts the surface structure as it might appear when viewed with the microscope; the luster or texture of each grain depends on its reflectanceproperties. A photomicrograph of a polycrystalline specimen exhibiting these char-acteristics is shown in Figure 4.13 c. Also, small grooves form along grain boundaries as a consequence of etching. Since atoms along grain boundary regions are more chemically active, they dissolveat a greater rate than those within the grains. These grooves become discerniblewhen viewed under a microscope because they reflect light at an angle differentfrom that of the grains themselves; this effect is displayed in Figure 4.14 a. Figure 4.14b is a photomicrograph of a polycrystalline specimen in which the grain bound- ary grooves are clearly visible as dark lines. When the microstructure of a two-phase alloy is to be examined, an etchant is often chosen that produces a different texture for each phase so that the differentphases may be distinguished from each other. Electron Microscopy The upper limit to the magnification possible with an optical microscope is ap-proximately 2000 times. Consequently, some structural elements are too fine orsmall to permit observation using optical microscopy. Under such circumstancesthe electron microscope, which is capable of much higher magnifications, may beemployed. An image of the structure under investigation is formed using beams of elec- trons instead of light radiation. According to quantum mechanics, a high-velocityelectron will become wave-like, having a wavelength that is inversely proportionalto its velocity. When accelerated across large voltages, electrons can be made tohave wavelengths on the order of 0.003 nm (3 pm). High magnifications and re-solving powers of these microscopes are consequences of the short wavelengths ofelectron beams.

ofelectron beams. The electron beam is focused and the image formed with magneticlenses; otherwise the geometry of the microscope components is essentially the sameas with optical systems. Both transmission and reflection beam modes of operationare possible for electron microscopes.98 •Chapter 4 / Imperfections in Solids 1496T_c04_80-108 11/14/05 9:53 Page 98REVISED PAGESTransmission Electron Microscopy The image seen with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) is formed by an electron beam that passes through the specimen. Details of internal microstructural features are accessible to observation; contrasts in the image are produced by dif-ferences in beam scattering or diffraction produced between various elements ofthe microstructure or defect. Since solid materials are highly absorptive to electronbeams, a specimen to be examined must be prepared in the form of a very thin foil;4.10 Microscopic Techniques •99 Figure 4.13 (a) Polished and etched grains as they mightappear when viewedwith an opticalmicroscope.

The transmitted beam is projected onto a fluorescent screen or aphotographic film so that the image may be viewed. Magnifications approaching are possible with transmission electron microscopy, which is frequently utilized in the study of dislocations.

of dislocations. Scanning Electron Microscopy A more recent and extremely useful investigative tool is the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The surface of a specimen to be examined is scanned with an electron beam, and the reflected (or back-scattered) beam of electrons is collected,then displayed at the same scanning rate on a cathode ray tube (similar to a CRTtelevision screen).The image on the screen, which may be photographed, representsthe surface features of the specimen.

Magnifications ranging from 10 to in excess of 50,000 times are possible, as are also very great depths of field. Accessoryequipment permits qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of the elemental com-position of very localized surface areas. Scanning Probe Microscopy In the past decade and a half, the field of microscopy has experienced a revolutionwith the development of a new family of scanning probe microscopes.

probe microscopes. This scanning probe microscope (SPM), of which there are several varieties, differs from the op- tical and electron microscopes in that neither light nor electrons is used to form animage. Rather, the microscope generates a topographical map, on an atomic scale,that is a representation of surface features and characteristics of the specimen be-ing examined. Some of the features that differentiate the SPM from other micro-scopic techniques are as follows: Examination on the nanometer scale is possible inasmuch as magnifications as high as are possible; much better resolutions are attainable than withother microscopic techniques. Three-dimensional magnified images are generated that provide topographi- cal information about features of interest. Some SPMs may be operated in a variety of environments (e.g., vacuum, air, liquid); thus, a particular specimen may be examined in its most suitableenvironment. Scanning probe microscopes employ a tiny probe with a very sharp tip that is brought into very close proximity (i.e., to within on the order of a nanometer) of the specimen surface. This probe is then raster-scanned across the plane of the surface.During scanning, the probe experiences deflections perpendicular to this plane, in re-sponse to electronic or other interactions between the probe and specimen surface.The in-surface-plane and out-of-plane motions of the probe are controlled by piezo-electric (Section 18.25) ceramic components that have nanometer resolutions. Fur-thermore, these probe movements are monitored electronically, and transferred toand stored in a computer, which then generates the three-dimensional surface image. Specific scanning probe microscopic techniques differ from one another with regard to the type of interaction that is monitored. A scanning probe micrographin which may be observed the atomic structure and a missing atom on the surfaceof silicon is shown in the chapter-opening photograph for this chapter. These new SPMs, which allow examination of the surface of materials at the atomic and molecular level, have provided a wealth of information about a host ofmaterials, from integrated circuit chips to biological molecules.

biological molecules. Indeed, the adventof the SPMs has helped to usher in the era of nanomaterials—materials whose prop-erties are designed by engineering atomic and molecular structures. Figure 4.15a is a bar-chart showing dimensional size ranges for several types of structures found in materials (note that the axes are scaled logarithmically). Like-wise, the useful dimensional resolution ranges for the several microscopic techniquesdiscussed in this chapter (plus the naked eye) are presented in the bar-chart ofFigure 4.15b. For three of these techniques (viz. SPM, TEM, and SEM), an upperresolution value is not imposed by the characteristics of the microscope, and,therefore, is somewhat arbitrary and not well defined. Furthermore, by comparingFigures 4.15 aand 4.15b, it is possible to decide which microscopic technique(s) is (are) best suited for examination of each of the structure types.10 9/H110034.10 Microscopic Techniques •101 scanning probe microscope (SPM)1496T_c04_80-108 11/14/05 12:38 Page 101REVISED PAGES4.11 GRAIN SIZE DETERMINATION The grain size is often determined when the properties of a polycrystalline mate- rial are under consideration. In this regard, there exist a number of techniques by which size is specified in terms of average grain volume, diameter, or area. Grainsize may be estimated by using an intercept method, described as follows. Straightlines all the same length are drawn through several photomicrographs that showthe grain structure. The grains intersected by each line segment are counted; theline length is then divided by an average of the number of grains intersected, takenover all the line segments.The average grain diameter is found by dividing this resultby the linear magnification of the photomicrographs.

the photomicrographs. Probably the most common method utilized, however, is that devised by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). 7The ASTM has prepared several standard comparison charts, all having different average grain sizes.

The several types of imperfection are categorized on the basis oftheir geometry and size. Point defects are those associated with one or two atomicpositions, including vacancies (or vacant lattice sites), self-interstitials (host atomsthat occupy interstitial sites), and impurity atoms. Impurities in Solids A solid solution may form when impurity atoms are added to a solid, in which case the original crystal structure is retained and no new phases are formed. For substi-tutional solid solutions, impurity atoms substitute for host atoms, and appreciablesolubility is possible only when atomic diameters and electronegativities for bothatom types are similar, when both elements have the same crystal structure, andwhen the impurity atoms have a valence that is the same as or less than the hostmaterial. Interstitial solid solutions form for relatively small impurity atoms thatoccupy interstitial sites among the host atoms. Specification of Composition Composition of an alloy may be specified in weight percent or atom percent. The basis for weight percent computations is the weight (or mass) of each alloy con-stituent relative to the total alloy weight. Atom percents are calculated in terms ofthe number of moles for each constituent relative to the total moles of all the ele-ments in the alloy. Dislocations—Linear Defects Dislocations are one-dimensional crystalline defects of which there are two pure types: edge and screw. An edge may be thought of in terms of the lattice distortionalong the end of an extra half-plane of atoms; a screw, as a helical planar ramp.

planar ramp. Formixed dislocations, components of both pure edge and screw are found. The mag-nitude and direction of lattice distortion associated with a dislocation are specifiedby its Burgers vector. The relative orientations of Burgers vector and dislocationline are (1) perpendicular for edge, (2) parallel for screw, and (3) neither perpen-dicular nor parallel for mixed. /H110052 16.5/H1100212 a100 85b2 /H1100562.6 grains/in.2 NM/H110052n/H110021 a100 Mb2n/H110056.5 M/H1100585 NM,1M/H1140810022NM/H11005104 •Chapter 4 / Imperfections in Solids1496T_c04_80-108 11/14/05 9:53 Page 104REVISED PAGESInterfacial Defects Bulk or Volume DefectsAtomic Vibrations Other imperfections include interfacial defects [external surfaces, grain boundaries (both small- and high-angle), twin boundaries, etc. ], volume defects (cracks, pores,etc. ), and atomic vibrations. Each type of imperfection has some influence on theproperties of a material. Microscopic Techniques Many of the important defects and structural elements of materials are of micro- scopic dimensions, and observation is possible only with the aid of a microscope.Both optical and electron microscopes are employed, usually in conjunction withphotographic equipment. Transmissive and reflective modes are possible for eachmicroscope type; preference is dictated by the nature of the specimen as well as thestructural element or defect to be examined. More recent scanning probe microscopic techniques have been developed that generate topographical maps representing the surface features and characteristicsof the specimen. Examinations on the atomic and molecular levels are possible usingthese techniques. Grain Size Determination Grain size of polycrystalline materials is frequently determined using photomicro- graphic techniques.

graphic techniques. Two methods are commonly employed: intercept and standardcomparison charts.References •105 IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS AlloyAtom percentAtomic vibrationBoltzmann’s constantBurgers vectorCompositionDislocation lineEdge dislocationGrain sizeImperfectionInterstitial solid solutionMicroscopyMicrostructureMixed dislocationPhotomicrographPoint defectScanning electron microscope (SEM)Scanning probe microscope (SPM)Screw dislocationSelf-interstitialSolid solutionSoluteSolventSubstitutional solid solutionTransmission electron microscope (TEM)VacancyWeight percent REFERENCES ASM Handbook, Vol. 9, Metallography and Micro- structures, ASM International, Materials Park, OH, 2004.

Materials of all types are often heat treated to im- prove their properties. The phenomena that occurduring a heat treatment almost always involve atomicdiffusion. Often an enhancement of diffusion rate isdesired; on occasion measures are taken to reduce it.Heat-treating temperatures and times, and/or coolingrates are often predictable using the mathematics ofdiffusion and appropriate diffusion constants. Thesteel gear shown on this page has been case hardened(Section 8.10); that is, its hardness and resistance tofailure by fatigue have been enhanced by diffusingexcess carbon or nitrogen into the outer surface layer. WHY STUDY Diffusion?1496T_c05_109-130 12/20/05 7:52 Page 1092nd REVISE PAGES5.1 INTRODUCTION Many reactions and processes that are important in the treatment of materials rely on the transfer of mass either within a specific solid (ordinarily on a microscopic level)or from a liquid, a gas, or another solid phase.

solid phase. This is necessarily accomplished bydiffusion, the phenomenon of material transport by atomic motion. This chapter dis- cusses the atomic mechanisms by which diffusion occurs, the mathematics of diffu-sion, and the influence of temperature and diffusing species on the rate of diffusion. The phenomenon of diffusion may be demonstrated with the use of a diffusion couple, which is formed by joining bars of two different metals together so that there is intimate contact between the two faces; this is illustrated for copper andnickel in Figure 5.1, which includes schematic representations of atom positions andcomposition across the interface. This couple is heated for an extended period atan elevated temperature (but below the melting temperature of both metals), andLearning Objectives After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1.Name and describe the two atomic mechanisms of diffusion. 2.Distinguish between steady-state andnonsteady-state diffusion. 3. (a) Write Fick’s first and second laws in equa- tion form, and define all parameters. (b) Note the kind of diffusion for which each of these equations is normally applied.4.Write the solution to Fick’s second law for diffusion into a semi-infinite solid when theconcentration of diffusing species at the surfaceis held constant.

room temperature. Chemical analysis will reveal a condition similar to that represented in Figure 5.2—namely, pure copper and nickel at the two extrem-ities of the couple, separated by an alloyed region. Concentrations of both metalsvary with position as shown in Figure 5.2 c. This result indicates that copper atoms have migrated or diffused into the nickel, and that nickel has diffused into copper.This process, whereby atoms of one metal diffuse into another, is termed interdif- fusion, or impurity diffusion. Interdiffusion may be discerned from a macroscopic perspective by changes in concentration which occur over time, as in the example for the Cu–Ni diffusion cou-ple. There is a net drift or transport of atoms from high- to low-concentration re-gions. Diffusion also occurs for pure metals, but all atoms exchanging positions areof the same type; this is termed self-diffusion. Of course, self-diffusion is not nor- mally subject to observation by noting compositional changes. 5.2 DIFFUSION MECHANISMS From an atomic perspective, diffusion is just the stepwise migration of atoms fromlattice site to lattice site. In fact, the atoms in solid materials are in constant mo-tion, rapidly changing positions. For an atom to make such a move, two conditionsmust be met: (1) there must be an empty adjacent site, and (2) the atom must havesufficient energy to break bonds with its neighbor atoms and then cause some lat-tice distortion during the displacement. This energy is vibrational in nature (Sec-tion 4.8).At a specific temperature some small fraction of the total number of atomsis capable of diffusive motion, by virtue of the magnitudes of their vibrationalenergies. This fraction increases with rising temperature. Several different models for this atomic motion have been proposed; of these possibilities, two dominate for metallic diffusion.5.2 Diffusion Mechanisms •111 Figure 5.2 (a) A copper–nickel diffusion couple after a high-temperature heat treatment, showing the alloyed diffusion zone.

This mechanism is aptly termed vacancy diffusion. Of course, this process necessitates the presence of vacancies, and the extent to which vacancy diffusioncan occur is a function of the number of these defects that are present; significantconcentrations of vacancies may exist in metals at elevated temperatures (Section 4.2).Since diffusing atoms and vacancies exchange positions, the diffusion of atoms inone direction corresponds to the motion of vacancies in the opposite direction. Bothself-diffusion and interdiffusion occur by this mechanism; for the latter, the impu-rity atoms must substitute for host atoms. Interstitial Diffusion The second type of diffusion involves atoms that migrate from an interstitial posi-tion to a neighboring one that is empty. This mechanism is found for interdiffusionof impurities such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, which have atomsthat are small enough to fit into the interstitial positions. Host or substitutional im-purity atoms rarely form interstitials and do not normally diffuse via this mecha-nism. This phenomenon is appropriately termed interstitial diffusion (Figure 5.3 b). In most metal alloys, interstitial diffusion occurs much more rapidly than diffu- sion by the vacancy mode, since the interstitial atoms are smaller and thus more mo-bile.

more mo-bile. Furthermore, there are more empty interstitial positions than vacancies; hence,the probability of interstitial atomic movement is greater than for vacancy diffusion. 5.3 STEADY-STATE DIFFUSION Diffusion is a time-dependent process—that is, in a macroscopic sense, the quan-tity of an element that is transported within another is a function of time. Often it112 •Chapter 5 / Diffusion Motion of a host or substitutional atom VacancyVacancy Position of interstitial atom after diffusionPosition of interstitial atom before diffusion(a) (b)Figure 5.3 Schematic representations of (a) vacancy diffusion and (b) interstitial diffusion. vacancy diffusion interstitial diffusion1496T_c05_109-130 11/14/05 10:12 Page 112REVISED PAGES5.3 Steady-State Diffusion •113 is necessary to know how fast diffusion occurs, or the rate of mass transfer. This rate is frequently expressed as a diffusion flux (J), defined as the mass (or, equiva- lently, the number of atoms) M diffusing through and perpendicular to a unit cross-sectional area of solid per unit of time. In mathematical form, this may berepresented as (5.1a) where Adenotes the area across which diffusion is occurring and tis the elapsed diffusion time. In differential form, this expression becomes (5.1b) The units for J are kilograms or atoms per meter squared per second (kg/m 2-s or atoms/m2-s). If the diffusion flux does not change with time, a steady-state condition exists. One common example of steady-state diffusion is the diffusion of atoms of a gas through a plate of metal for which the concentrations (or pressures) of the diffus-ing species on both surfaces of the plate are held constant. This is representedschematically in Figure 5.4 a. When concentration Cis plotted versus position (or distance) within the solid x, the resulting curve is termed the concentration profile; the slope at a particular point on this curve is the concentration gradient: (5.2a) In the present treatment, the concentration profile is assumed to be linear, asdepicted in Figure 5.4 b, and (5.2b) concentration gradient /H11005¢C ¢x/H11005CA/H11002CB xA/H11002xBconcentration gradient /H11005dC dxJ/H110051 A dM dtJ/H11005M AtDefinition of diffusion flux steady-state diffusion concentration profile concentration gradient xA xB Position, xConcentration of diffusing species, C (b) (a)CA CBThin metal plate Area, ADirection of diffusion of gaseous speciesGas at pressure PB Gas at pressure PAPA > PB and constant Figure 5.4 (a) Steady-state diffusion across a thin plate.

The negative sign in this expression indicatesthat the direction of diffusion is down the concentration gradient, from a high to alow concentration. Equation 5.3 is sometimes called Fick’s first law. Sometimes the term driving force is used in the context of what compels a re- action to occur. For diffusion reactions, several such forces are possible; but whendiffusion is according to Equation 5.3, the concentration gradient is the driving force. One practical example of steady-state diffusion is found in the purification of hydrogen gas. One side of a thin sheet of palladium metal is exposed to the impuregas composed of hydrogen and other gaseous species such as nitrogen, oxygen, andwater vapor. The hydrogen selectively diffuses through the sheet to the oppositeside, which is maintained at a constant and lower hydrogen pressure. EXAMPLE PROBLEM 5.1 Diffusion Flux Computation A plate of iron is exposed to a carburizing (carbon-rich) atmosphere on oneside and a decarburizing (carbon-deficient) atmosphere on the other side at ( ). If a condition of steady state is achieved, calculate the diffu- sion flux of carbon through the plate if the concentrations of carbon at posi tions of 5 and 10 mm ( and ) beneath the carburizing surface are 1.2and 0.8 kg/m 3, respectively.

Sub- stitution of the values above into this expression yields 5.4 NONSTEADY-STATE DIFFUSION Most practical diffusion situations are nonsteady-state ones. That is, the diffusion flux and the concentration gradient at some particular point in a solid vary withtime, with a net accumulation or depletion of the diffusing species resulting. This isillustrated in Figure 5.5, which shows concentration profiles at three different /H110052.4/H1100310/H110029 kg/m2-s J/H11005/H11002 D CA/H11002CB xA/H11002xB/H11005/H1100213/H1100310/H1100211 m2/s2 11.2/H110020.82 kg/m3 15/H1100310/H110023/H1100210/H1100222 m3/H1100310/H1100211 m2/s10/H110022 m 5/H1100310/H1100231300/H11034F 700/H11034CJ/H11005/H11002 D dC dx114 •Chapter 5 / Diffusion Fick’s first law— diffusion flux forsteady-state diffusion(in one direction) diffusion coefficient driving forceFick’s first law 1Conversion of concentration from weight percent to mass per unit volume (in kg/m3) is possible using Equation 4.9.1496T_c05_109-130 11/14/05 10:12 Page 114REVISED PAGESdiffusion times.

Comprehen-sive collections of these are given by Crank, and Carslaw and Jaeger (see References). One practically important solution is for a semi-infinite solid 2in which the sur- face concentration is held constant. Frequently, the source of the diffusing speciesis a gas phase, the partial pressure of which is maintained at a constant value. Fur-thermore, the following assumptions are made: 1.Before diffusion, any of the diffusing solute atoms in the solid are uniformlydistributed with concentration of 2.The value of xat the surface is zero and increases with distance into the solid. 3.The time is taken to be zero the instant before the diffusion process begins. These boundary conditions are simply stated as Application of these boundary conditions to Equation 5.4b yields the solution (5.5)C x/H11002C0 Cs/H11002C0/H110051/H11002erf ax 21Dtb C/H11005C0 at x /H11005q For t70, C /H11005Cs 1the constant surface concentration 2 at x /H110050 For t/H110050, C /H11005C0 at 0 /H11349x/H11349qC0.0C 0t/H11005D 02C 0x20C 0t/H110050 0x aD 0C 0xb5.4 Nonsteady-State Diffusion •115 Fick’s second law Fick’s second law— diffusion equationfor nonsteady-statediffusion (in onedirection) 2A bar of solid is considered to be semi-infinite if none of the diffusing atoms reaches the bar end during the time over which diffusion takes place.

Problem 5.3. EXAMPLE PROBLEM 5.2 Nonsteady-State Diffusion Time Computation I For some applications, it is necessary to harden the surface of a steel (or iron- carbon alloy) above that of its interior. One way this may be accomplished isby increasing the surface concentration of carbon in a process termed car- burizing; the steel piece is exposed, at an elevated temperature, to an atmo- sphere rich in a hydrocarbon gas, such as methane Consider one such alloy that initially has a uniform carbon concentration of 0.25 wt% and is to be treated at 950 C (1750 F). If the concentration ofcarbon at the surface is suddenly brought to and maintained at 1.20 wt%, howlong will it take to achieve a carbon content of 0.80 wt% at a position 0.5 mmbelow the surface? The diffusion coefficient for carbon in iron at this tem-perature is m 2/s; assume that the steel piece is semi-infinite. Solution Since this is a nonsteady-state diffusion problem in which the surface com- position is held constant, Equation 5.5 is used. Values for all the parametersin this expression except time tare specified in the problem as follows: Thus, We must now determine from Table 5.1 the value of zfor which the error function is 0.4210.

Determine the approximate time at 500 C that will produce the same diffusion result (in terms of concentra-tion of Cu at some specific point in Al) as a 10-h heat treatment at 600°C. Solution This is a diffusion problem in which Equation 5.6b may be employed. The composition in both diffusion situations will be equal at the same position (i.e.,xis also a constant), thus (5.7) at both temperatures. That is, or 5.5 FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE DIFFUSION Diffusing Species The magnitude of the diffusion coefficient D is indicative of the rate at which atoms diffuse. Coefficients, both self- and interdiffusion, for several metallic systems are listed in Table 5.2. The diffusing species as well as the host material influence the diffu-sion coefficient. For example, there is a significant difference in magnitude betweenself-diffusion and carbon interdiffusion in iron at 500 C, the D value being greater for the carbon interdiffusion ( vs. ).This comparison also provides a contrast between rates of diffusion via vacancy and interstitial modesas discussed above. Self-diffusion occurs by a vacancy mechanism, whereas carbondiffusion in iron is interstitial. Temperature Temperature has a most profound influence on the coefficients and diffusion rates.For example, for the self-diffusion of Fe in -Fe, the diffusion coefficient increasesapproximately six orders of magnitude (from 3.0 to 1.8 in rising temperature from 500 to 900 C (Table 5.2).

Also noted are D values at 500 C. /H110341/H11408TThe heart of all computers and other electronic devices is the integrated circuit (or IC).4Each integrated circuit chip is a thin square wafer hav-ing dimensions on the order of 6 mm by 6 mm by0.4 mm; furthermore, literally millions of inter-connected electronic components and circuits areembedded in one of the chip faces. The base ma-terial for ICs is silicon, to which has been addedvery specific and extremely minute and controlledconcentrations of impurities that are confined tovery small and localized regions. For some ICs, theimpurities are added using high-temperature dif-fusion heat treatments. One important step in the IC fabrication process is the deposition of very thin and narrowconducting circuit paths to facilitate the passageof current from one device to another; these pathsare called “interconnects,” and several are shownin Figure 5.9, a scanning electron micrograph ofan IC chip. Of course the material to be used forinterconnects must have a high electrical conduc-tivity—a metal, since, of all materials, metals havethe highest conductivities.

highest conductivities. Table 5.3 cites valuesfor silver, copper, gold, and aluminum, the mostconductive metals.On the basis of these conductivities, and dis-counting material cost, Ag is the metal of choice,followed by Cu, Au, and Al. Once these interconnects have been de- posited, it is still necessary to subject the IC chipto other heat treatments, which may run as high as500 C. If, during these treatments, there is signifi-cant diffusion of the interconnect metal into thesilicon, the electrical functionality of the IC will bedestroyed. Thus, since the extent of diffusion is de-pendent on the magnitude of the diffusion coeffi-cient, it is necessary to select an interconnect metalthat has a small value of D in silicon.

Also, a dashed vertical line has beenconstructed at 500 C, from which values of D, for the four metals are noted at this temperature. Hereit may be seen that the diffusion coefficient for alu-minum in silicon ( m 2/s) is at least four orders of magnitude (i.e., a factor of 104) lower than the values for the other three metals.

three metals. Aluminum is indeed used for interconnects in some integrated circuits; even though its electricalconductivity is slightly lower than the values for2.5/H1100310 /H1100221/H110341/H11408T silver, copper, and gold, its extremely low diffusioncoefficient makes it the material of choice for thisapplication. An aluminum-copper-silicon alloy(Al-4 wt% Cu-1.5 wt% Si) is sometimes also usedfor interconnects; it not only bonds easily to thesurface of the chip, but is also more corrosion re-sistant than pure aluminum. More recently, copper interconnects have also been used. However, it is first necessary to deposita very thin layer of tantalum or tantalum nitridebeneath the copper, which acts as a barrier to deterdiffusion of Cu into the silicon. 5.6 OTHER DIFFUSION PATHS Atomic migration may also occur along dislocations, grain boundaries, and exter-nal surfaces. These are sometimes called “ short-circuit” diffusion paths inasmuch as rates are much faster than for bulk diffusion. However, in most situations short-circuit contributions to the overall diffusion flux are insignificant because the cross-sectional areas of these paths are extremely small. SUMMARY Diffusion Mechanisms Solid-state diffusion is a means of mass transport within solid materials by stepwise atomic motion. The term “self-diffusion” refers to the migration of host atoms; forimpurity atoms, the term “interdiffusion” is used. Two mechanisms are possible: va-cancy and interstitial. For a given host metal, interstitial atomic species generallydiffuse more rapidly. Steady-State Diffusion Nonsteady-State Diffusion For steady-state diffusion, the concentration profile of the diffusing species is time independent, and the flux or rate is proportional to the negative of the concen-tration gradient according to Fick’s first law.

first law. The mathematics for nonsteady stateare described by Fick’s second law, a partial differential equation. The solution fora constant surface composition boundary condition involves the Gaussian errorfunction. Factors That Influence Diffusion The magnitude of the diffusion coefficient is indicative of the rate of atomic mo- tion, being strongly dependent on and increasing exponentially with increasingtemperature.1496T_c05_109-130 11/14/05 10:13 Page 125REVISED PAGES126 •Chapter 5 / Diffusion Activation energy CarburizingConcentration gradientConcentration profileDiffusionDiffusion coefficientDiffusion fluxDriving forceFick’s first and second lawsInterdiffusion (impurity diffusion)Interstitial diffusionNonsteady-state diffusionSelf-diffusionSteady-state diffusionVacancy diffusion REFERENCES Gale, W.

Compute the number of kilo-grams of hydrogen that pass per hour througha 6-mm-thick sheet of palladium having anarea of 0.25 m 2at C. Assume a diffusion coefficient of m2/s, that the con- centrations at the high- and low-pressuresides of the plate are 2.0 and 0.4 kg of hy-drogen per cubic meter of palladium, and thatsteady-state conditions have been attained. 5.7A sheet of steel 2.5 mm thick has nitrogenatmospheres on both sides at C andis permitted to achieve a steady-state diffu-sion condition. The diffusion coefficient fornitrogen in steel at this temperature is m 2/s, and the diffusion flux is found to be kg/m2-s. Also, it is known that the concentration of nitrogenin the steel at the high-pressure surface is2 kg/m How far into the sheet from this high- pressure side will the concentration be 0.5kg/m 3? Assume a linear concentration profile. 5.8A sheet of BCC iron 2 mm thick was exposedto a carburizing gas atmosphere on one sideand a decarburizing atmosphere on the otherside at C.

It has beenproposed to accomplish this by passing bothgases through a thin sheet of some metal atan elevated temperature; inasmuch as hy-drogen diffuses through the plate at a higherrate than does nitrogen, the partial pressureof hydrogen will be higher on the exit side ofthe sheet.

not occur. The mechanical be-havior of a material reflects the relationship between its response or deformationto an applied load or force. Important mechanical properties are strength, hardness,ductility, and stiffness. The mechanical properties of materials are ascertained by performing carefully designed laboratory experiments that replicate as nearly as possible the serviceconditions. Factors to be considered include the nature of the applied load and itsduration, as well as the environmental conditions. It is possible for the load to betensile, compressive, or shear, and its magnitude may be constant with time, or it mayfluctuate continuously. Application time may be only a fraction of a second, or itmay extend over a period of many years. Service temperature may be an importantfactor. Mechanical properties are of concern to a variety of parties (e.g., producers and consumers of materials, research organizations, government agencies) that have dif-fering interests. Consequently, it is imperative that there be some consistency in themanner in which tests are conducted, and in the interpretation of their results. Thisconsistency is accomplished by using standardized testing techniques. Estab lishment and publication of these standards are often coordinated by professional societies. Inthe United States the most active organization is the American Society for Testingand Materials (ASTM). Its Annual Book of ASTM Standards (http://www.astm.org) comprises numerous volumes, which are issued and updated yearly; a large number ofthese standards relate to mechanical testing techniques. Several of these are referencedby footnote in this and subsequent chapters. The role of structural engineers is to determine stresses and stress distributions within members that are subjected to well-defined loads. This may be accomplishedLearning Objectives After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1.Define engineering stress and engineering strain. 2.State Hooke’s law, and note the conditionsunder which it is valid. 3.Define Poisson’s ratio.

These topics are treated in traditional stress analysis and strength ofmaterials texts. Materials and metallurgical engineers, on the other hand, are concerned with producing and fabricating materials to meet service requirements as predicted bythese stress analyses. This necessarily involves an understanding of the relationshipsbetween the microstructure (i.e., internal features) of materials and their mechanicalproperties. Materials are frequently chosen for structural applications because they have desirable combinations of mechanical characteristics. The present discussion is con-fined primarily to the mechanical behavior of metals; polymers and ceramics aretreated separately because they are, to a large degree, mechanically dissimilar tometals.

dissimilar tometals. This chapter discusses the stress–strain behavior of metals and the relatedmechanical properties, and also examines other important mechanical characteris-tics. Discussions of the microscopic aspects of deformation mechanisms and meth-ods to strengthen and regulate the mechanical behavior of metals are deferred tolater chapters. 6.2 CONCEPTS OF STRESS AND STRAIN If a load is static or changes relatively slowly with time and is applied uniformlyover a cross section or surface of a member, the mechanical behavior may be as-certained by a simple stress–strain test; these are most commonly conducted formetals at room temperature. There are three principal ways in which a load maybe applied: namely, tension, compression, and shear (Figures 6.1 a,b,c). In engi- neering practice many loads are torsional rather than pure shear; this type of load-ing is illustrated in Figure 6.1 d. Tension Tests1 One of the most common mechanical stress–strain tests is performed in tension.A s will be seen, the tension test can be used to ascertain several mechanical proper-ties of materials that are important in design. A specimen is deformed, usually tofracture, with a gradually increasing tensile load that is applied uniaxially along thelong axis of a specimen. A standard tensile specimen is shown in Figure 6.2. Nor-mally, the cross section is circular, but rectangular specimens are also used. This“dogbone” specimen configuration was chosen so that, during testing, deformationis confined to the narrow center region (which has a uniform cross section alongits length), and, also, to reduce the likelihood of fracture at the ends of the speci-men. The standard diameter is approximately 12.8 mm (0.5 in. ), whereas the re-duced section length should be at least four times this diameter; 60 mm ( in.)

( in.) iscommon. Gauge length is used in ductility computations, as discussed in Section 6.6;the standard value is 50 mm (2.0 in.). The specimen is mounted by its ends into theholding grips of the testing apparatus (Figure 6.3). The tensile testing machine isdesigned to elongate the specimen at a constant rate, and to continuously andsimultaneously measure the instantaneous applied load (with a load cell) and theresulting elongations (using an extensometer).A stress–strain test typically takes sev-eral minutes to perform and is destructive; that is, the test specimen is permanentlydeformed and usually fractured.2 1 4 1ASTM Standards E 8 and E 8M, “Standard Test Methods for Tension Testing of Metallic Materials.”6.2 Concepts of Stress and Strain •1331496T_c06_131-173 11/16/05 17:06 Page 133REVISED PAGESDefinition of engineering stress(for tension andcompression)134 •Chapter 6 / Mechanical Properties of Metals The output of such a tensile test is recorded (usually on a computer) as load or force versus elongation. These load–deformation characteristics are dependent on the specimen size. For example, it will require twice the load to produce the sameelongation if the cross-sectional area of the specimen is doubled. To minimize thesegeometrical factors, load and elongation are normalized to the respective parametersof engineering stress and engineering strain.

The units of engineering stress (referred to subsequently as just stress) are megapascals, MPa (SI) (where1 MPa N/m 2), and pounds force per square inch, psi (Customary U.S.).2 Engineering strain is defined according to (6.2) in which is the original length before any load is applied, and is the instanta-neous length. Sometimes the quantity is denoted as and is the deforma-tion elongation or change in length at some instant, as referenced to the originallength. Engineering strain (subsequently called just strain) is unitless, but metersper meter or inches per inch are often used; the value of strain is obviously inde-pendent of the unit system. Sometimes strain is also expressed as a percentage, inwhich the strain value is multiplied by 100. Compression Tests3 Compression stress–strain tests may be conducted if in-service forces are of thistype. A compression test is conducted in a manner similar to the tensile test, exceptthat the force is compressive and the specimen contracts along the direction of thestress.

Furthermore, since is greater than compressive strains com-puted from Equation 6.2 are necessarily also negative. Tensile tests are more com-mon because they are easier to perform; also, for most materials used in structuralapplications, very little additional information is obtained from compressive tests.l i, l0¢l, li/H11002l0li l0/H9280/H11005li/H11002l0 l0/H11005¢l l0/H9280/H11005106A0 1lbf2Load cell Extensometer Specimen Moving crossheadFigure 6.3 Schematic representation of the apparatus used to conduct tensile stress–strain tests.

Shear and Torsional Tests4 For tests performed using a pure shear force as shown in Figure 6.1 c, the shear stress is computed according to (6.3) where Fis the load or force imposed parallel to the upper and lower faces, each of which has an area of . The shear strain is defined as the tangent of the strainangle , as indicated in the figure. The units for shear stress and strain are the sameas for their tensile counterparts. Torsion is a variation of pure shear, wherein a structural member is twisted in the manner of Figure 6.1 d; torsional forces produce a rotational motion about the longitudinal axis of one end of the member relative to the other end. Examples oftorsion are found for machine axles and drive shafts, and also for twist drills. Tor-sional tests are normally performed on cylindrical solid shafts or tubes. A shearstress is a function of the applied torque T, whereas shear strain is related to the angle of twist, in Figure 6.1 d. Geometric Considerations of the Stress State Stresses that are computed from the tensile, compressive, shear, and torsional forcestates represented in Figure 6.1 act either parallel or perpendicular to planar facesof the bodies represented in these illustrations. Note that the stress state is a func-tion of the orientations of the planes upon which the stresses are taken to act. Forexample, consider the cylindrical tensile specimen of Figure 6.4 that is subjected toa tensile stress applied parallel to its axis. Furthermore, consider also the plane that is oriented at some arbitrary angle relative to the plane of the specimen end-face. Upon this plane , the applied stress is no longer a pure tensile one.Rather, a more complex stress state is present that consists of a tensile (or normal)stress that acts normal to the plane and, in addition, a shear stress thatacts parallel to this plane; both of these stresses are represented in the figure.

the figure. Usingmechanics of materials principles, 5it is possible to develop equations for and in terms of and , as follows: (6.4a) (6.4b) These same mechanics principles allow the transformation of stress componentsfrom one coordinate system to another coordinate system that has a different ori-entation.

For most metals that are stressed in tension and at relatively lowlevels, stress and strain are proportional to each other through the relationship (6.5) This is known as Hooke’s law, and the constant of proportionality E(GPa or psi) 6 is the modulus of elasticity, or Young’s modulus. For most typical metals the mag- nitude of this modulus ranges between 45 GPa ( psi), for magnesium, and407 GPa ( psi), for tungsten.

for tungsten.

Figure 6.5. The slope of this linear segment corresponds to the modulus of elasticity E . This modulus may be thought of as stiffness, or a material’s resistance to elastic deformation. The greater the modulus, the stiffer the material, orthe smaller the elastic strain that results from the application of a given stress. Themodulus is an important design parameter used for computing elastic deflections. Elastic deformation is nonpermanent, which means that when the applied load is released, the piece returns to its original shape. As shown in the stress–strain plot(Figure 6.5), application of the load corresponds to moving from the origin up andalong the straight line. Upon release of the load, the line is traversed in the oppo-site direction, back to the origin. There are some materials (e.g., gray cast iron, concrete, and many polymers) for which this elastic portion of the stress–strain curve is not linear (Figure 6.6); hence, itis not possible to determine a modulus of elasticity as described above. For this non-linear behavior, either tangent or secant modulus is normally used. Tangent modulus is taken as the slope of the stress–strain curve at some specified level of stress, whilesecant modulus represents the slope of a secant drawn from the origin to some givenpoint of the curve. The determination of these moduli is illustrated in Figure 6.6. s–/H9280138 •Chapter 6 / Mechanical Properties of Metals StrainStress 00Slope = modulus of elasticityUnload LoadFigure 6.5 Schematic stress–strain diagram showing linear elastic deformation for loading and unloading cycles. elastic deformation Stress/H9268/H92682 /H92681 Strain /H9280/H9004/H9268 /H9004/H9280= Tangent modulus (at 2)/H9268 /H9004/H9268 /H9004/H9280= Secant modulus (between origin and 1)/H9268Figure 6.6 Schematic stress–strain diagram showing non-linear elastic behavior, andhow secant and tangent moduliare determined.Metal Alloys1496T_c06_131-173 12/21/05 7:43 Page 1382nd REVISE PAGES6.3 Stress–Strain Behavior •139 On an atomic scale, macroscopic elastic strain is manifested as small changes in the interatomic spacing and the stretching of interatomic bonds.

interatomic bonds. As a conse- quence, the magnitude of the modulus of elasticity is a measure of the resistanceto separation of adjacent atoms, that is, the interatomic bonding forces. Further-more, this modulus is proportional to the slope of the interatomic force–separationcurve (Figure 2.8 a) at the equilibrium spacing: (6.6) Figure 6.7 shows the force–separation curves for materials having both strong andweak interatomic bonds; the slope at is indicated for each. Values of the modulus of elasticity for ceramic materials are about the same as for metals; for polymers they are lower (Figure 1.4). These differences are a directconsequence of the different types of atomic bonding in the three materials types.Furthermore, with increasing temperature, the modulus of elasticity diminishes, asis shown for several metals in Figure 6.8.r 0E r adF drb r00 Weakly bondedStrongly bonded Separation r Force FdF dr r0 Temperature (°F) Temperature (°C)–200 0 200 400 600 80070 60 50 40 30 20 10400 300 200 100 0 0 Modulus of elasticity (106 psi)Modulus of elasticity (GPa) AluminumSteelTungsten–400 400 0 800 1200 1600Figure 6.7 Force versus interatomic separation for weakly and strongly bonded atoms.

elastic behavior. The stress–strain characteristics at low stress levels are virtually the same for both tensile and compressive situations, to include the mag-nitude of the modulus of elasticity. Shear stress and strain are proportional to eachother through the expression (6.7) where Gis the shear modulus, the slope of the linear elastic region of the shear stress–strain curve. Table 6.1 also gives the shear moduli for a number of the com-mon metals. 6.4 ANELASTICITY Up to this point, it has been assumed that elastic deformation is time independent—that is, that an applied stress produces an instantaneous elastic strain that remains con-stant over the period of time the stress is maintained. It has also been assumed thatupon release of the load the strain is totally recovered—that is, that the strain imme-diately returns to zero. In most engineering materials, however, there will also exist atime-dependent elastic strain component. That is, elastic deformation will continue af-ter the stress application, and upon load release some finite time is required for com-plete recovery. This time-dependent elastic behavior is known as anelasticity, and it is due to time-dependent microscopic and atomistic processes that are attendant to thedeformation. For metals the anelastic component is normally small and is often ne-glected. However, for some polymeric materials its magnitude is significant; in this caseit is termed viscoelastic behavior, which is the discussion topic of Section 15.4. EXAMPLE PROBLEM 6.1 Elongation (Elastic) Computation A piece of copper originally 305 mm (12 in.) long is pulled in tension with astress of 276 MPa (40,000 psi). If the deformation is entirely elastic, what willbe the resultant elongation? Solution Since the deformation is elastic, strain is dependent on stress according to Equa- tion 6.5.

As a result of this elongation, there will be constrictions in the lateral (x and y) directions perpendicular to the applied stress; from these contractions, the compressive strains and may be determined.If the applied stress is uniaxial (only in the zdirection), and the material is isotropic, then A parameter termed Poisson’s ratio is defined as the ratio of the lateral and axial strains, or (6.8) The negative sign is included in the expression so that will always be positive,since and will always be of opposite sign.

opposite sign. Theoretically, Poisson’s ratio forisotropic materials should be ; furthermore, the maximum value for (or that valuefor which there is no net volume change) is 0.50. For many metals and other alloys,values of Poisson’s ratio range between 0.25 and 0.35. Table 6.1 shows values forseveral common metallic materials. For isotropic materials, shear and elastic moduli are related to each other and to Poisson’s ratio according to (6.9) In most metals G is about 0.4E; thus, if the value of one modulus is known, the other may be approximated. Many materials are elastically anisotropic; that is, the elastic behavior (e.g., the magnitude of E) varies with crystallographic direction (see Table 3.3).

crystal structure. Even for isotropic materials, for complete characterization of the elasticproperties, at least two constants must be given. Since the grain orientation is ran-dom in most polycrystalline materials, these may be considered to be isotropic; in-organic ceramic glasses are also isotropic. The remaining discussion of mechanicalbehavior assumes isotropy and polycrystallinity because such is the character ofmost engineering materials.

As the material is deformed beyond this point, the stress is no longer pro-portional to strain (Hooke’s law, Equation 6.5, ceases to be valid), and permanent,nonrecoverable, or plastic deformation occurs. Figure 6.10 aplots schematically the tensile stress–strain behavior into the plastic region for a typical metal. The transi-tion from elastic to plastic is a gradual one for most metals; some curvature resultsat the onset of plastic deformation, which increases more rapidly with rising stress. /H11005171.3 /H1100310 6 N/m22a10/H1100310/H110023 m 2b2 p/H110055600 N 11293 lbf2 F/H11005sA0/H11005s ad0 2b2 ps/H11005/H9280zE/H1100517.35 /H1100310/H1100242197/H11003103 MPa2/H1100571.3 MPa14/H11003106/H9280z/H11005/H11002/H9280x n/H11005/H110021/H110022.5 /H1100310/H1100242 0.34/H110057.35 /H1100310/H110024 plastic deformation Figure 6.10 (a) Typical stress– strain behavior for a metal showing elastic and plastic deformations, the proportional limit P , and the yield strength as determined using the 0.002 strain offset method.

The mechanismof this deformation is different for crystalline and amorphous materials. For crys-talline solids, deformation is accomplished by means of a process called slip, whichinvolves the motion of dislocations as discussed in Section 7.2. Plastic deformationin noncrystalline solids (as well as liquids) occurs by a viscous flow mechanism,which is outlined in Section 12.10. 6.6 TENSILE PROPERTIES Yielding and Yield Strength Most structures are designed to ensure that only elastic deformation will result whena stress is applied. A structure or component that has plastically deformed, or expe-rienced a permanent change in shape, may not be capable of functioning as intended. It is therefore desirable to know the stress level at which plastic deformation be-gins, or where the phenomenon of yielding occurs. For metals that experience this gradual elastic–plastic transition, the point of yielding may be determined as theinitial departure from linearity of the stress–strain curve; this is sometimes calledthe proportional limit, as indicated by point Pin Figure 6.10a. In such cases the position of this point may not be determined precisely. As a consequence, a con-vention has been established wherein a straight line is constructed parallel to theelastic portion of the stress–strain curve at some specified strain offset, usually 0.002.The stress corresponding to the intersection of this line and the stress–strain curveas it bends over in the plastic region is defined as the yield strength /H9268 y.7This is demonstrated in Figure 6.10 a.

6.10 a. Of course, the units of yield strength are MPa or psi.8 For those materials having a nonlinear elastic region (Figure 6.6), use of the strain offset method is not possible, and the usual practice is to define the yieldstrength as the stress required to produce some amount of strain (e.g., ). Some steels and other materials exhibit the tensile stress–strain behavior as shown in Figure 6.10 b. The elastic–plastic transition is very well defined and occurs abruptly in what is termed a yield point phenomenon.At the upper yield point, plastic deformation is initiated with an actual decrease in stress. Continued deformationfluctuates slightly about some constant stress value, termed the lower yield point;stress subsequently rises with increasing strain. For metals that display this effect,the yield strength is taken as the average stress that is associated with the lower yieldpoint, since it is well defined and relatively insensitive to the testing procedure. 9Thus, it is not necessary to employ the strain offset method for these materials. The magnitude of the yield strength for a metal is a measure of its resistance to plastic deformation. Yield strengths may range from 35 MPa (5000 psi) for a low-strength aluminum to over 1400 MPa (200,000 psi) for high-strength steels./H9280/H110050.005144 •Chapter 6 / Mechanical Properties of Metals 7“Strength” is used in lieu of “stress” because strength is a property of the metal, whereas stress is related to the magnitude of the applied load. 8For Customary U.S. units, the unit of kilopounds per square inch (ksi) is sometimes used for the sake of convenience, where 9Note that to observe the yield point phenomenon, a “stiff” tensile-testing apparatus must be used; by stiff is meant that there is very little elastic deformation of the machine during loading.1 ksi /H110051000 psiyield strengthyielding proportional limit Metal Alloys1496T_c06_131-173 12/21/05 7:43 Page 1442nd REVISE PAGES6.6 Tensile Properties •145 Concept Check 6.1 Cite the primary differences between elastic, anelastic, and plastic deformation behaviors.

deformation behaviors. [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Tensile Strength After yielding, the stress necessary to continue plastic deformation in metals in-creases to a maximum, point M in Figure 6.11, and then decreases to the eventual fracture, point F. The tensile strength TS(MPa or psi) is the stress at the maxi- mum on the engineering stress–strain curve (Figure 6.11). This corresponds to themaximum stress that can be sustained by a structure in tension; if this stress isapplied and maintained, fracture will result. All deformation up to this point isuniform throughout the narrow region of the tensile specimen. However, at thismaximum stress, a small constriction or neck begins to form at some point, and allsubsequent deformation is confined at this neck, as indicated by the schematicspecimen insets in Figure 6.11. This phenomenon is termed “necking,” and frac-ture ultimately occurs at the neck. The fracture strength corresponds to the stressat fracture. Tensile strengths may vary anywhere from 50 MPa (7000 psi) for an aluminum to as high as 3000 MPa (450,000 psi) for the high-strength steels. Ordinarily, whenthe strength of a metal is cited for design purposes, the yield strength is used. Thisis because by the time a stress corresponding to the tensile strength has been ap-plied, often a structure has experienced so much plastic deformation that it is use-less. Furthermore, fracture strengths are not normally specified for engineeringdesign purposes.tensile strength StrainM FTSStressFigure 6.11 Typical engineering stress– strain behavior to fracture, point F.

The percent elongation %EL is the percentage of plastic strain at fracture, or (6.11) where is the fracture length10and is the original gauge length as above. Inas- much as a significant proportion of the plastic deformation at fracture is confinedto the neck region, the magnitude of %EL will depend on specimen gauge length.The shorter the greater is the fraction of total elongation from the neck and, con-sequently, the higher the value of %EL. Therefore, should be specified when per-cent elongation values are cited; it is commonly 50 mm (2 in.). Percent reduction in area %RA is defined as (6.12) where is the original cross-sectional area and is the cross-sectional area at thepoint of fracture. 10Percent reduction in area values are independent of both and Furthermore, for a given material the magnitudes of %EL and %RA will, in general,be different. Most metals possess at least a moderate degree of ductility at room tem-perature; however, some become brittle as the temperature is lowered (Section 8.6). A knowledge of the ductility of materials is important for at least two reasons. First, it indicates to a designer the degree to which a structure will deform plastic-ally before fracture. Second, it specifies the degree of allowable deformation dur-ing fabrication operations. We sometimes refer to relatively ductile materials asbeing “forgiving,” in the sense that they may experience local deformation withoutfracture should there be an error in the magnitude of the design stress calculation. Brittle materials are approximately considered to be those having a fracture strain of less than about 5%.

about 5%. Thus, several important mechanical properties of metals may be determined from tensile stress–strain tests.

These properties are sensitive to any prior deformation, the presence of impurities, and/orany heat treatment to which the metal has been subjected. The modulus of elasticityis one mechanical parameter that is insensitive to these treatments. As with modulusof elasticity, the magnitudes of both yield and tensile strengths decline with increasingtemperature; just the reverse holds for ductility—it usually increases with temperature.Figure 6.14 shows how the stress–strain behavior of iron varies with temperature.

with temperature. Resilience Resilience is the capacity of a material to absorb energy when it is deformed elas- tically and then, upon unloading, to have this energy recovered.The associated prop-erty is the modulus of resilience, which is the strain energy per unit volume required to stress a material from an unloaded state up to the point of yielding. Computationally, the modulus of resilience for a specimen subjected to a uni- axial tension test is just the area under the engineering stress–strain curve taken toyielding (Figure 6.15), or (6.13a) U r/H11005/H20910/H9280y 0 sd/H9280Ur, Stress (103 psi)800 600400200 0 StrainStress (MPa)120 10080604020 0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5–200°C –100°C 25°CFigure 6.14 Engineering stress– strain behavior for iron at three temperatures. resilience Definition of modulus ofresilience Stress 0.002 Strainσy yFigure 6.15 Schematic representation showing how modulus of resilience (corresponding to the shaded area) is determined from the tensile stress–strain behavior of a material.1496T_c06_131-173 11/16/05 17:06 Page 149REVISED PAGESAssuming a linear elastic region, (6.13b) in which is the strain at yielding. The units of resilience are the product of the units from each of the two axes of the stress–strain plot. For SI units, this is joules per cubic meter (J/m3, equiva- lent to Pa), whereas with Customary U.S. units it is inch-pounds force per cubic inch (in.-lb f/in.3, equivalent to psi). Both joules and inch-pounds force are units of en- ergy, and thus this area under the stress–strain curve represents energy absorptionper unit volume (in cubic meters or cubic inches) of material.

of material. Incorporation of Equation 6.5 into Equation 6.13b yields (6.14) Thus, resilient materials are those having high yield strengths and low moduli ofelasticity; such alloys would be used in spring applications. Toughness Toughness is a mechanical term that is used in several contexts; loosely speaking, it is a measure of the ability of a material to absorb energy up to fracture. Speci-men geometry as well as the manner of load application are important in tough-ness determinations. For dynamic (high strain rate) loading conditions and when anotch (or point of stress concentration) is present, notch toughness is assessed by using an impact test, as discussed in Section 8.6. Furthermore, fracture toughness isa property indicative of a material’s resistance to fracture when a crack is present(Section 8.5). For the static (low strain rate) situation, toughness may be ascertained from the results of a tensile stress–strain test. It is the area under the – curve up tothe point of fracture. The units for toughness are the same as for resilience (i.e.,energy per unit volume of material). For a material to be tough, it must displayboth strength and ductility; often, ductile materials are tougher than brittle ones.This is demonstrated in Figure 6.13, in which the stress–strain curves are plottedfor both material types. Hence, even though the brittle material has higher yieldand tensile strengths, it has a lower toughness than the ductile one, by virtue oflack of ductility; this is deduced by comparing the areas ABC and in Figure 6.13.

This is not at all the case; as a matter of fact, it is increasing in strength. However, thecross-sectional area is decreasing rapidly within the neck region, where deformation isoccurring. This results in a reduction in the load-bearing capacity of the specimen.The stress, as computed from Equation 6.1, is on the basis of the original cross-sectional area before any deformation, and does not take into account this reductionin area at the neck. Sometimes it is more meaningful to use a true stress–true strain scheme. True stress is defined as the load Fdivided by the instantaneous cross-sectional area over which deformation is occurring (i.e., the neck, past the tensile point), or (6.15) Furthermore, it is occasionally more convenient to represent strain as true strain defined by (6.16) If no volume change occurs during deformation—that is, if (6.17) true and engineering stress and strain are related according to (6.18a) (6.18b) Equations 6.18a and 6.18b are valid only to the onset of necking; beyond this pointtrue stress and strain should be computed from actual load, cross-sectional area,and gauge length measurements.

As a consequence, the correct stress ( axial) within the neck is slightly lower than the stress computed from the applied load and neck cross-sectional area. This leads to the “corrected” curve in Figure 6.16.

elastic strain. This behavior is demonstratedin Figure 6.17, a schematic engineering stress–strain plot. During the unloading cy-cle, the curve traces a near straight-line path from the point of unloading (point D), and its slope is virtually identical to the modulus of elasticity, or parallel to the ini-tial elastic portion of the curve. The magnitude of this elastic strain, which is re-gained during unloading, corresponds to the strain recovery, as shown in Figure 6.17.If the load is reapplied, the curve will traverse essentially the same linear portionin the direction opposite to unloading; yielding will again occur at the unloadingstress level where the unloading began. There will also be an elastic strain recov-ery associated with fracture. 6.9 COMPRESSIVE, SHEAR, AND TORSIONAL DEFORMATION Of course, metals may experience plastic deformation under the influence of ap-plied compressive, shear, and torsional loads. The resulting stress–strain behaviorinto the plastic region will be similar to the tensile counterpart (Figure 6.10 a: yield- ing and the associated curvature).

Early hardness tests were based on natural minerals with a scaleconstructed solely on the ability of one material to scratch another that was softer.A qualitative and somewhat arbitrary hardness indexing scheme was devised,termed the Mohs scale, which ranged from 1 on the soft end for talc to 10 for dia-mond. Quantitative hardness techniques have been developed over the years inwhich a small indenter is forced into the surface of a material to be tested, undercontrolled conditions of load and rate of application. The depth or size of the re-sulting indentation is measured, which in turn is related to a hardness number;the softer the material, the larger and deeper is the indentation, and the lowerthe hardness index number. Measured hardnesses are only relative (rather thanabsolute), and care should be exercised when comparing values determined bydifferent techniques. Hardness tests are performed more frequently than any other mechanical test for several reasons: 1.They are simple and inexpensive—ordinarily no special specimen need beprepared, and the testing apparatus is relatively inexpensive. 2.The test is nondestructive—the specimen is neither fractured nor excessivelydeformed; a small indentation is the only deformation. 3.Other mechanical properties often may be estimated from hardness data,such as tensile strength (see Figure 6.19). Rockwell Hardness Tests11 The Rockwell tests constitute the most common method used to measure hardnessbecause they are so simple to perform and require no special skills.

special skills. Several differ-ent scales may be utilized from possible combinations of various indenters and dif-ferent loads, which permit the testing of virtually all metal alloys (as well as somepolymers). Indenters include spherical and hardened steel balls having diametersof and in. (1.588, 3.175, 6.350, and 12.70 mm), and a conical diamond (Brale)indenter, which is used for the hardest materials. With this system, a hardness number is determined by the difference in depth of penetration resulting from the application of an initial minor load followed by alarger major load; utilization of a minor load enhances test accuracy. On the basisof the magnitude of both major and minor loads, there are two types of tests: Rock-well and superficial Rockwell. For Rockwell, the minor load is 10 kg, whereas majorloads are 60, 100, and 150 kg. Each scale is represented by a letter of the alphabet;several are listed with the corresponding indenter and load in Tables 6.5 and 6.6a.For superficial tests, 3 kg is the minor load; 15, 30, and 45 kg are the possible ma-jor load values. These scales are identified by a 15, 30, or 45 (according to load),followed by N, T, W, X, or Y, depending on indenter. Superficial tests are frequentlyperformed on thin specimens.

For each scale, hardnesses may range up to 130; however, as hardness values rise above 100 or drop below 20 on any scale, they become inaccurate; and becausethe scales have some overlap, in such a situation it is best to utilize the next harderor softer scale. Inaccuracies also result if the test specimen is too thin, if an indentation is made too near a specimen edge, or if two indentations are made too close to one another.Specimen thickness should be at least ten times the indentation depth, whereasallowance should be made for at least three indentation diameters between thecenter of one indentation and the specimen edge, or to the center of a second in-dentation.

second in-dentation. Furthermore, testing of specimens stacked one on top of another is notrecommended. Also, accuracy is dependent on the indentation being made into asmooth flat surface. The modern apparatus for making Rockwell hardness measurements (see the chapter-opening photograph for this chapter) is automated and very simple to use;hardness is read directly, and each measurement requires only a few seconds. The modern testing apparatus also permits a variation in the time of load ap- plication. This variable must also be considered in interpreting hardness data.6.10 Hardness •157 12Rockwell scales are also frequently designated by an R with the appropriate scale letter as a subscript, for example, denotes the Rockwell C scale.

The diameter of the hardened steel (ortungsten carbide) indenter is 10.00 mm (0.394 in.). Standard loads range between500 and 3000 kg in 500-kg increments; during a test, the load is maintained constantfor a specified time (between 10 and 30 s).

30 s). Harder materials require greater ap-plied loads. The Brinell hardness number, HB, is a function of both the magnitudeof the load and the diameter of the resulting indentation (see Table 6.5). 14This di- ameter is measured with a special low-power microscope, utilizing a scale that isetched on the eyepiece. The measured diameter is then converted to the appropri-ate HB number using a chart; only one scale is employed with this technique. Semiautomatic techniques for measuring Brinell hardness are available. These employ optical scanning systems consisting of a digital camera mounted on a flex-ible probe, which allows positioning of the camera over the indentation. Datafrom the camera are transferred to a computer that analyzes the indentation, de-termines its size, and then calculates the Brinell hardness number. For this tech-nique, surface finish requirements are normally more stringent that for manualmeasurements. Maximum specimen thickness as well as indentation position (relative to spec- imen edges) and minimum indentation spacing requirements are the same as forRockwell tests. In addition, a well-defined indentation is required; this necessitatesa smooth flat surface in which the indentation is made. Knoop and Vickers Microindentation Hardness Tests15 Two other hardness-testing techniques are Knoop (pronounced ) and Vickers(sometimes also called diamond pyramid). For each test a very small diamond in-denter having pyramidal geometry is forced into the surface of the specimen. Ap-plied loads are much smaller than for Rockwell and Brinell, ranging between 1 and1000 g. The resulting impression is observed under a microscope and measured; thismeasurement is then converted into a hardness number (Table 6.5). Careful speci-men surface preparation (grinding and polishing) may be necessary to ensure awell-defined indentation that may be accurately measured.

accurately measured. The Knoop and Vickershardness numbers are designated by HK and HV , respectively, 16and hardness scales for both techniques are approximately equivalent. Knoop and Vickers are referredto as microindentation-testing methods on the basis of indenter size. Both are wellsuited for measuring the hardness of small, selected specimen regions; furthermore,Knoop is used for testing brittle materials such as ceramics. The modern microindentation hardness-testing equipment has been automated by coupling the indenter apparatus to an image analyzer that incorporates a com-puter and software package. The software controls important system functions toinclude indent location, indent spacing, computation of hardness values, and plot-ting of data.nu p158 •Chapter 6 / Mechanical Properties of Metals 13 ASTM Standard E 10, “Standard Test Method for Brinell Hardness of Metallic Materials.” 14 The Brinell hardness number is also represented by BHN. 15 ASTM Standard E 92, “Standard Test Method for Vickers Hardness of Metallic Materi- als,” and ASTM Standard E 384, “Standard Test for Microhardness of Materials.” 16 Sometimes KHN and VHN are used to denote Knoop and Vickers hardness numbers, respectively.1496T_c06_131-173 11/16/05 17:06 Page 158REVISED PAGESOther hardness-testing techniques are frequently employed but will not be dis- cussed here; these include ultrasonic microhardness, dynamic (Scleroscope), durom- eter (for plastic and elastomeric materials), and scratch hardness tests. These aredescribed in references provided at the end of the chapter. Hardness Conversion The facility to convert the hardness measured on one scale to that of another ismost desirable. However, since hardness is not a well-defined material property, andbecause of the experimental dissimilarities among the various techniques, a com-prehensive conversion scheme has not been devised.

Correlation Between Hardness and Tensile Strength Both tensile strength and hardness are indicators of a metal’s resistance to plasticdeformation. Consequently, they are roughly proportional, as shown in Figure 6.19,for tensile strength as a function of the HB for cast iron, steel, and brass. The sameproportionality relationship does not hold for all metals, as Figure 6.19 indicates.As a rule of thumb for most steels, the HB and the tensile strength are relatedaccording to (6.20a) (6.20b) Concept Check 6.4 Of those metals listed in Table 6.3, which is the hardest?

For example, consider a num-ber of identical tensile samples that are prepared from a single bar of some metal al-loy, which samples are subsequently stress–strain tested in the same apparatus.

same apparatus. Wewould most likely observe that each resulting stress–strain plot is slightly different fromthe others. This would lead to a variety of modulus of elasticity, yield strength, and ten-sile strength values. A number of factors lead to uncertainties in measured data. Theseinclude the test method, variations in specimen fabrication procedures, operator bias,and apparatus calibration. Furthermore, inhomogeneities may exist within the samelot of material, and/or slight compositional and other differences from lot to lot. Ofcourse, appropriate measures should be taken to minimize the possibility of measure-ment error, and also to mitigate those factors that lead to data variability. It should also be mentioned that scatter exists for other measured material prop- erties such as density, electrical conductivity, and coefficient of thermal expansion. It is important for the design engineer to realize that scatter and variability of materials properties are inevitable and must be dealt with appropriately. On occa-sion, data must be subjected to statistical treatments and probabilities determined.For example, instead of asking the question, “What is the fracture strength of thisalloy?” the engineer should become accustomed to asking the question, “What isthe probability of failure of this alloy under these given circumstances?” It is often desirable to specify a typical value and degree of dispersion (or scat- ter) for some measured property; such is commonly accomplished by taking theaverage and the standard deviation, respectively. Computation of Average and Standard Deviation Values An average value is obtained by dividing the sum of all measured values by thenumber of measurements taken. In mathematical terms, the average of someparameter xis (6.21) where nis the number of observations or measurements and is the value of a discrete measurement. Furthermore, the standard deviation sis determined using the following expression: (6.22) s/H11005£a n i/H1100511xi/H11002x22 n/H110021§1/H114082xix/H11005an i/H110051xi nx6.11 Variability of Material Properties •161 Computation of average value Computation of standard deviation1496T_c06_131-173 11/16/05 17:06 Page 161REVISED PAGESwhere , and nare defined above.

Furthermore, as noted in the previous section,virtually all engineering materials exhibit a variability in their measured me-chanical properties. Consequently, design allowances must be made to protectagainst unanticipated failure. One way this may be accomplished is by estab-lishing, for the particular application, a design stress, denoted as For static situations and when ductile materials are used, is taken as the calculated stresslevel (on the basis of the estimated maximum load) multiplied by a design factor, ; that is, (6.23) where is greater than unity. Thus, the material to be used for the particularapplication is chosen so as to have a yield strength at least as high as this valueof Alternatively, a safe stress or working stress, , is used instead of design stress. This safe stress is based on the yield strength of the material and is defined as theyield strength divided by a factor of safety, N,o r (6.24) Utilization of design stress (Equation 6.23) is usually preferred since it is based on the anticipated maximum applied stress instead of the yield strength of the ma-terial; normally there is a greater uncertainty in estimating this stress level than inthe specification of the yield strength.

The design calls for two cylindrical sup- port posts, each of which is to support half of the maximum load. Furthermore,plain-carbon (1045) steel ground and polished shafting rounds are to be used;the minimum yield and tensile strengths of this alloy are 310 MPa (45,000 psi)and 565 MPa (82,000 psi), respectively. Specify a suitable diameter for thesesupport posts. Solution The first step in this design process is to decide on a factor of safety, N, which then allows determination of a working stress according to Equation 6.24.

Concepts of stress and strain were firstintroduced. Stress is a measure of an applied mechanical load or force, normalizedto take into account cross-sectional area. Two different stress parameters weredefined—engineering stress and true stress.

true stress. Strain represents the amount of defor-mation induced by a stress; both engineering and true strains are used. Some of the mechanical characteristics of metals can be ascertained by simple stress–strain tests.There are four test types: tension, compression, torsion, and shear.Tensile are the most common. A material that is stressed first undergoes elastic, ornonpermanent, deformation, wherein stress and strain are proportional. The con-stant of proportionality is the modulus of elasticity for tension and compression,and is the shear modulus when the stress is shear. Poisson’s ratio represents thenegative ratio of transverse and longitudinal strains. Tensile Properties The phenomenon of yielding occurs at the onset of plastic or permanent deforma- tion; yield strength is determined by a strain offset method from the stress–strainbehavior, which is indicative of the stress at which plastic deformation begins. Ten-sile strength corresponds to the maximum tensile stress that may be sustained bya specimen, whereas percents elongation and reduction in area are measures ofductility—the amount of plastic deformation that has occurred at fracture. Re-silience is the capacity of a material to absorb energy during elastic deformation;modulus of resilience is the area beneath the engineering stress–strain curve upto the yield point. Also, static toughness represents the energy absorbed duringthe fracture of a material, and is taken as the area under the entire engineeringstress–strain curve. Ductile materials are normally tougher than brittle ones. Hardness Hardness is a measure of the resistance to localized plastic deformation. In several popular hardness-testing techniques (Rockwell, Brinell, Knoop, and Vickers) a smallindenter is forced into the surface of the material, and an index number is deter-mined on the basis of the size or depth of the resulting indentation. For many met-als, hardness and tensile strength are approximately proportional to each other.

each other. Variability of Material Properties Measured mechanical properties (as well as other material properties) are not ex- act and precise quantities, in that there will always be some scatter for the mea-sured data. Typical material property values are commonly specified in terms ofaverages, whereas magnitudes of scatter may be expressed as standard deviations. Design/Safety Factors As a result of uncertainties in both measured mechanical properties and inservice applied stresses, design or safe stresses are normally utilized for design purposes. Forductile materials, safe stress is the ratio of the yield strength and the factor of safety.Summary •165 1496T_c06_131-173 11/16/05 17:06 Page 165REVISED PAGESIMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS166 •Chapter 6 / Mechanical Properties of Metals Anelasticity Design stressDuctilityElastic deformationElastic recoveryEngineering strainEngineering stressHardnessModulus of elasticityPlastic deformationPoisson’s ratioProportional limitResilienceSafe stressShearTensile strengthToughnessTrue strainTrue stressYieldingYield strength REFERENCES ASM Handbook, Vol. 8, Mechanical Testing and Evaluation, ASM International, Materials Park, OH, 2000.

With a knowledge of the nature of dislocations and the role they play in the plastic deformation process,we are able to understand the underlying mechanismsof the techniques that are used to strengthen andharden metals and their alloys. Thus, it becomes possi-ble to design and tailor the mechanical properties ofmaterials—for example, the strength or toughness of ametal–matrix composite. WHY STUDY Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms ?1496T_c07_174-206 12/21/05 8:27 Page 1742nd REVISE PAGES7.1 INTRODUCTION Chapter 6 explained that materials may experience two kinds of deformation: elas- tic and plastic. Plastic deformation is permanent, and strength and hardness aremeasures of a material’s resistance to this deformation. On a microscopic scale, plas-tic deformation corresponds to the net movement of large numbers of atoms inresponse to an applied stress. During this process, interatomic bonds must be rup-tured and then reformed. In crystalline solids, plastic deformation most ofteninvolves the motion of dislocations, linear crystalline defects that were introducedin Section 4.5. This chapter discusses the characteristics of dislocations and their in-volvement in plastic deformation. Twinning, another process by which some metalsplastically deform, is also treated. In addition, and probably most importantly, sev-eral techniques are presented for strengthening single-phase metals, the mechanismsof which are described in terms of dislocations. Finally, the latter sections of thischapter are concerned with recovery and recrystallization—processes that occur inplastically deformed metals, normally at elevated temperatures—and, in addition,grain growth. Dislocations and Plastic Deformation Early materials studies led to the computation of the theoretical strengths of per-fect crystals, which were many times greater than those actually measured.

actually measured. Dur-ing the 1930s it was theorized that this discrepancy in mechanical strengths couldbe explained by a type of linear crystalline defect that has since come to be knownas a dislocation. It was not until the 1950s, however, that the existence of suchdislocation defects was established by direct observation with the electron mi-croscope. Since then, a theory of dislocations has evolved that explains many ofthe physical and mechanical phenomena in metals [as well as crystalline ceramics(Section 12.10)]. 7.2 BASIC CONCEPTS Edge and screw are the two fundamental dislocation types. In an edge dislocation,localized lattice distortion exists along the end of an extra half-plane of atoms, whichalso defines the dislocation line (Figure 4.3). A screw dislocation may be thought ofLearning Objectives After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1.Describe edge and screw dislocation motion from an atomic perspective. 2.Describe how plastic deformation occurs by themotion of edge and screw dislocations in re-sponse to applied shear stresses. 3.Define slip system and cite one example. 4.Describe how the grain structure of a polycrys-talline metal is altered when it is plasticallydeformed. 5.Explain how grain boundaries impede dislocationmotion and why a metal having small grains isstronger than one having large grains.6.Describe and explain solid-solution strengthen- ing for substitutional impurity atoms in terms oflattice strain interactions with dislocations. 7.Describe and explain the phenomenon of strainhardening (or cold working) in terms of disloca-tions and strain field interactions. 8.Describe recrystallization in terms of both thealteration of microstructure and mechanicalcharacteristics of the material. 9.Describe the phenomenon of grain growth fromboth macroscopic and atomic perspectives.1496T_c07_174-206 12/21/05 7:48 Page 1752nd REVISE PAGESas resulting from shear distortion; its dislocation line passes through the center of a spiral, atomic plane ramp (Figure 4.4).

(Figure 4.4). Many dislocations in crystalline materials haveboth edge and screw components; these are mixed dislocations (Figure 4.5). Plastic deformation corresponds to the motion of large numbers of dislocations. An edge dislocation moves in response to a shear stress applied in a direction per-pendicular to its line; the mechanics of dislocation motion are represented in Fig-ure 7.1. Let the initial extra half-plane of atoms be plane A. When the shear stress is applied as indicated (Figure 7.1 a), plane Ais forced to the right; this in turn pushes the top halves of planes B, C,D, and so on, in the same direction. If the applied shear stress is of sufficient magnitude, the interatomic bonds of plane Bare sev- ered along the shear plane, and the upper half of plane Bbecomes the extra half- plane as plane Alinks up with the bottom half of plane B (Figure 7.1 b).This process is subsequently repeated for the other planes, such that the extra half-plane, by dis-crete steps, moves from left to right by successive and repeated breaking of bondsand shifting by interatomic distances of upper half-planes. Before and after themovement of a dislocation through some particular region of the crystal, the atomicarrangement is ordered and perfect; it is only during the passage of the extra half-plane that the lattice structure is disrupted. Ultimately this extra half-plane mayemerge from the right surface of the crystal, forming an edge that is one atomicdistance wide; this is shown in Figure 7.1 c. The process by which plastic deformation is produced by dislocation motion is termed slip; the crystallographic plane along which the dislocation line traverses is the slip plane, as indicated in Figure 7.1. Macroscopic plastic deformation sim- ply corresponds to permanent deformation that results from the movement ofdislocations, or slip, in response to an applied shear stress, as represented inFigure 7.2 a. Dislocation motion is analogous to the mode of locomotion employed by a caterpillar (Figure 7.3).

(Figure 7.3). The caterpillar forms a hump near its posterior end bypulling in its last pair of legs a unit leg distance. The hump is propelled forward byrepeated lifting and shifting of leg pairs. When the hump reaches the anterior end,176 •Chapter 7 / Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms Figure 7.1 Atomic rearrangements that accompany the motion of an edge dislocation as it moves in response to an applied shear stress.

The cater- pillar hump and its motion correspond to the extra half-plane of atoms in the dis-location model of plastic deformation. The motion of a screw dislocation in response to the applied shear stress is shown in Figure 7.2 b; the direction of movement is perpendicular to the stress di- rection. For an edge, motion is parallel to the shear stress. However, the net plasticdeformation for the motion of both dislocation types is the same (see Figure 7.2).The direction of motion of the mixed dislocation line is neither perpendicular norparallel to the applied stress, but lies somewhere in between.

in between. All metals and alloys contain some dislocations that were introduced during solidification, during plastic deformation, and as a consequence of thermal stressesthat result from rapid cooling. The number of dislocations, or dislocation density in a material, is expressed as the total dislocation length per unit volume or, equiva-lently, the number of dislocations that intersect a unit area of a random section. Theunits of dislocation density are millimeters of dislocation per cubic millimeter orjust per square millimeter. Dislocation densities as low as are typicallyfound in carefully solidified metal crystals.

of metals. These include strain fields that exist around dislocations, whichare influential in determining the mobility of the dislocations, as well as their abil-ity to multiply. When metals are plastically deformed, some fraction of the deformation energy (approximately 5%) is retained internally; the remainder is dissipated as heat. Themajor portion of this stored energy is as strain energy associated with dislocations.Consider the edge dislocation represented in Figure 7.4.As already mentioned, someatomic lattice distortion exists around the dislocation line because of the presenceof the extra half-plane of atoms. As a consequence, there are regions in which com-pressive, tensile, and shear lattice strains are imposed on the neighboring atoms. For example, atoms immediately above and adjacent to the dislocation line are squeezedtogether. As a result, these atoms may be thought of as experiencing a compressivestrain relative to atoms positioned in the perfect crystal and far removed from thedislocation; this is illustrated in Figure 7.4. Directly below the half-plane, the effectis just the opposite; lattice atoms sustain an imposed tensile strain, which is as shown.Shear strains also exist in the vicinity of the edge dislocation. For a screw disloca-tion, lattice strains are pure shear only. These lattice distortions may be consideredto be strain fields that radiate from the dislocation line. The strains extend intothe surrounding atoms, and their magnitude decreases with radial distance from the dislocation. The strain fields surrounding dislocations in close proximity to one another may interact such that forces are imposed on each dislocation by the combined in-teractions of all its neighboring dislocations. For example, consider two edge dis-locations that have the same sign and the identical slip plane, as represented inFigure 7.5 a. The compressive and tensile strain fields for both lie on the same side of the slip plane; the strain field interaction is such that there exists between thesetwo isolated dislocations a mutual repulsive force that tends to move them apart.On the other hand, two dislocations of opposite sign and having the same slipplane will be attracted to one another, as indicated in Figure 7.5 b, and dislocation1 mm/H110022.104 mm/H110022; 102106 mm/H110022.178 •Chapter 7 / Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms lattice strain Compression TensionFigure 7.4 Regions of compression (green) and tension (yellow) located around an edge dislocation.

That is, the two extra half-planes of atoms will align and become a complete plane. Dislocation interactions are possible be-tween edge, screw, and/or mixed dislocations, and for a variety of orientations.Thesestrain fields and associated forces are important in the strengthening mechanismsfor metals. During plastic deformation, the number of dislocations increases dramatically. We know that the dislocation density in a metal that has been highly deformed maybe as high as One important source of these new dislocations is exist- ing dislocations, which multiply; furthermore, grain boundaries, as well as internaldefects and surface irregularities such as scratches and nicks, which act as stress con-centrations, may serve as dislocation formation sites during deformation. 7.4 SLIP SYSTEMS Dislocations do not move with the same degree of ease on all crystallographic planesof atoms and in all crystallographic directions. Ordinarily there is a preferred plane,and in that plane there are specific directions along which dislocation motion oc-curs. This plane is called the slip plane; it follows that the direction of movement is called the slip direction. This combination of the slip plane and the slip direction is termed the slip system. The slip system depends on the crystal structure of the metal and is such that the atomic distortion that accompanies the motion of a dislocationis a minimum. For a particular crystal structure, the slip plane is the plane that hasthe most dense atomic packing—that is, has the greatest planar density.

planar density. The slip di-rection corresponds to the direction, in this plane, that is most closely packed withatoms—that is, has the highest linear density. Planar and linear atomic densitieswere discussed in Section 3.11. Consider, for example, the FCC crystal structure, a unit cell of which is shown in Figure 7.6a .There is a set of planes, the {111} family, all of which are closely packed. A (111)-type plane is indicated in the unit cell; in Figure 7.6 b, this plane is positioned within the plane of the page, in which atoms are now represented as touching near-est neighbors.mm/H110022. 10107.4 Slip Systems •179 CC TT (a)Repulsion CT TCAttraction ;+ =Dislocation annihilation (Perfect crystal) (b)Figure 7.5 (a) Two edge dislocations of the same sign and lying on the same slip plane exert a repulsive force on each other; Cand Tdenote compression and tensile regions, respectively.

Hence, {111} represents the slip plane and direction com- bination, or the slip system for FCC. Figure 7.6b demonstrates that a given slip plane may contain more than a single slip direction.

slip direction. Thus, several slip systems may existfor a particular crystal structure; the number of independent slip systems representsthe different possible combinations of slip planes and directions. For example, forface-centered cubic, there are 12 slip systems: four unique {111} planes and, withineach plane, three independent directions. The possible slip systems for BCC and HCP crystal structures are listed in Table 7.1. For each of these structures, slip is possible on more than one family of planes(e.g., {110}, {211}, and {321} for BCC). For metals having these two crystal struc-tures, some slip systems are often operable only at elevated temperatures. Metals with FCC or BCC crystal structures have a relatively large number of slip systems (at least 12). These metals are quite ductile because extensive plasticdeformation is normally possible along the various systems. Conversely, HCP met-als, having few active slip systems, are normally quite brittle. The Burgers vector concept was introduced in Section 4.5, and denoted by a b for edge, screw, and mixed dislocations in Figures 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5, respectively. Withregard to the process of slip, a Burgers vector’s direction corresponds to a disloca-tion’s slip direction, whereas its magnitude is equal to the unit slip distance (orinteratomic separation in this direction). Of course, both the direction and the mag-nitude of b will depend on crystal structure, and it is convenient to specify a Burg- ers vector in terms of unit cell edge length ( a) and crystallographic direction indices.H110IH110IH110I180 •Chapter 7 / Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms Table 7.1 Slip Systems for Face-Centered Cubic, Body-Centered Cubic, and Hexagonal Close-Packed Metals Number of Metals Slip Plane Slip Direction Slip Systems Face-Centered Cubic Cu, Al, Ni, Ag, Au 51116 12 Body-Centered Cubic -Fe, W, Mo 51106 12 W 52116 12 K 53216 24 Hexagonal Close-Packed Cd, Zn, Mg, Ti, Be 500016 3 Ti, Mg, Zr 3 Ti, Mg 6 H1120I 510116H1120I 510106H1120IH111I a-Fe,H111I a-Fe,H111I aH110IFigure 7.6 (a) A {111} slip system shown within an FCC unit cell.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 7.5 SLIP IN SINGLE CRYSTALS A further explanation of slip is simplified by treating the process in single crystals, then making the appropriate extension to polycrystalline materials. As mentionedpreviously, edge, screw, and mixed dislocations move in response to shear stresses ap-plied along a slip plane and in a slip direction. As noted in Section 6.2, even thoughan applied stress may be pure tensile (or compressive), shear components exist at allbut parallel or perpendicular alignments to the stress direction (Equation 6.4b).Theseare termed resolved shear stresses, and their magnitudes depend not only on the ap- plied stress, but also on the orientation of both the slip plane and direction withinthat plane. Let represent the angle between the normal to the slip plane and theapplied stress direction, and the angle between the slip and stress directions, as in-dicated in Figure 7.7; it can then be shown that for the resolved shear stress (7.2) where is the applied stress.

applied stress. In general, since it need not be the case that the tensile axis, the slip plane normal, and the slip direction all lie in the same plane. A metal single crystal has a number of different slip systems that are capable of operating. The resolved shear stress normally differs for each one because theorientation of each relative to the stress axis ( and angles) also differs. How-ever, one slip system is generally oriented most favorably—that is, has the largestresolved shear stress, (max): (7.3) In response to an applied tensile or compressive stress, slip in a single crystal com-mences on the most favorably oriented slip system when the resolved shear stressreaches some critical value, termed the critical resolved shear stress ; it repre- sents the minimum shear stress required to initiate slip, and is a property of thet crsstR1max2/H11005s1cos f cos l2maxtRl ff/H11001l/HS1100590/H11034, stR/H11005s cos f cos ltRlf51106H111I51006H010I51106H110I51006H110I b1HCP2/H11005a 3 H112 0I b1BCC2/H11005a 2 H111I b1FCC2/H11005a 2 H110I7.5 Slip in Single Crystals •181 Resolved shear stress—dependenceon applied stress andorientation of stressdirection relative toslip plane normaland slip directionresolved shear stress critical resolved shear stress1496T_c07_174-206 11/17/05 13:32 Page 181REVISED PAGESmaterial that determines when yielding occurs.The single crystal plastically deforms or yields when and the magnitude of the applied stress required to initiate yielding (i.e., the yield strength ) is (7.4) The minimum stress necessary to introduce yielding occurs when a single crystal isoriented such that under these conditions, (7.5) For a single-crystal specimen that is stressed in tension, deformation will be as in Figure 7.8, where slip occurs along a number of equivalent and most favorablyoriented planes and directions at various positions along the specimen length.

Furthermore, for HCP crystals having few slip systems, if the stressaxis for the most favorable slip system is either perpendicular to the slip direction or parallel to the slip plane the critical resolved shear stress will be zero.

more complex. Because of the random crystallographic orientations of the numerous grains, thedirection of slip varies from one grain to another. For each, dislocation motion occursalong the slip system that has the most favorable orientation, as defined above. Thisis exemplified by a photomicrograph of a polycrystalline copper specimen that hasbeen plastically deformed (Figure 7.10); before deformation the surface was pol-ished. Slip lines 1are visible, and it appears that two slip systems operated for most of the grains, as evidenced by two sets of parallel yet intersecting sets of lines. Fur-thermore, variation in grain orientation is indicated by the difference in alignmentof the slip lines for the several grains. Gross plastic deformation of a polycrystalline specimen corresponds to the com- parable distortion of the individual grains by means of slip. During deformation,mechanical integrity and coherency are maintained along the grain boundaries; thatis, the grain boundaries usually do not come apart or open up. As a consequence,each individual grain is constrained, to some degree, in the shape it may assume byits neighboring grains. The manner in which grains distort as a result of gross plas-tic deformation is indicated in Figure 7.11. Before deformation the grains areequiaxed, or have approximately the same dimension in all directions. For this par-ticular deformation, the grains become elongated along the direction in which thespecimen was extended. Polycrystalline metals are stronger than their single-crystal equivalents, which means that greater stresses are required to initiate slip and the attendant yielding.This is, to a large degree, also a result of geometrical constraints that are imposedon the grains during deformation. Even though a single grain may be favorably ori-ented with the applied stress for slip, it cannot deform until the adjacent and lessfavorably oriented grains are capable of slip also; this requires a higher appliedstress level.

appliedstress level. 7.7 DEFORMATION BY TWINNING In addition to slip, plastic deformation in some metallic materials can occur by theformation of mechanical twins, or twinning. The concept of a twin was introduced inSection 4.6; that is, a shear force can produce atomic displacements such that on oneside of a plane (the twin boundary), atoms are located in mirror-image positions ofatoms on the other side. The manner in which this is accomplished is demonstrated7.7 Deformation by Twinning •185 (b)The yield strength may be computed from Equation 7.4; and will be the same as for part (a), and sy/H1100530 MPa 1cos 45/H1103421cos 54.7/H11034 2/H1100573.4 MPa 110,600 psi 2l f sy 1 These slip lines are microscopic ledges produced by dislocations (Figure 7.1 c) that have exited from a grain and appear as lines when viewed with a microscope.

Here, open circles represent atoms that did not move, and dashed and solid circles represent original and final positions, respectively, of atoms within thetwinned region. As may be noted in this figure, the displacement magnitude withinthe twin region (indicated by arrows) is proportional to the distance from the twinplane. Furthermore, twinning occurs on a definite crystallographic plane and in aspecific direction that depend on crystal structure. For example, for BCC metals, thetwin plane and direction are (112) and [111], respectively. Slip and twinning deformations are compared in Figure 7.13 for a single crystal that is subjected to a shear stress . Slip ledges are shown in Figure 7.13 a, the formation of which was described in Section 7.5; for twinning, the shear deformation is homo-geneous (Figure 7.13 b). These two processes differ from each other in several respects. First, for slip, the crystallographic orientation above and below the slip plane is thesame both before and after the deformation; for twinning, there will be a reorienta-tion across the twin plane. In addition, slip occurs in distinct atomic spacing multiples,whereas the atomic displacement for twinning is less than the interatomic separation. Mechanical twinning occurs in metals that have BCC and HCP crystal struc- tures, at low temperatures, and at high rates of loading (shock loading), conditionsunder which the slip process is restricted; that is, there are few operable slip systems.t7.7 Deformation by Twinning •187 Polished surface Twin plane Twin plane/H9270 /H9270 (a) (b) Figure 7.12 Schematic diagram showing how twinning results from an applied shear stress .

However, the real importance of twinning lies with theaccompanying crystallographic reorientations; twinning may place new slip systemsin orientations that are favorable relative to the stress axis such that the slip processcan now take place. Mechanisms of Strengthening in Metals Metallurgical and materials engineers are often called on to design alloys havinghigh strengths yet some ductility and toughness; ordinarily, ductility is sacrificed whenan alloy is strengthened. Several hardening techniques are at the disposal of an en-gineer, and frequently alloy selection depends on the capacity of a material to betailored with the mechanical characteristics required for a particular application. Important to the understanding of strengthening mechanisms is the relation be- tween dislocation motion and mechanical behavior of metals. Because macroscopicplastic deformation corresponds to the motion of large numbers of dislocations, the ability of a metal to plastically deform depends on the ability of dislocations to move . Since hardness and strength (both yield and tensile) are related to the ease withwhich plastic deformation can be made to occur, by reducing the mobility of dislo-cations, the mechanical strength may be enhanced; that is, greater mechanical forceswill be required to initiate plastic deformation.

plastic deformation. In contrast, the more unconstrainedthe dislocation motion, the greater is the facility with which a metal may deform,and the softer and weaker it becomes. Virtually all strengthening techniques relyon this simple principle: restricting or hindering dislocation motion renders a mate- rial harder and stronger . The present discussion is confined to strengthening mechanisms for single-phase metals, by grain size reduction, solid-solution alloying, and strain hardening. De-formation and strengthening of multiphase alloys are more complicated, involvingconcepts beyond the scope of the present discussion; Chapter 10 and Section 11.9treat techniques that are used to strengthen multiphase alloys. 7.8 STRENGTHENING BY GRAIN SIZE REDUCTION The size of the grains, or average grain diameter, in a polycrystalline metal influ-ences the mechanical properties. Adjacent grains normally have different crystal-lographic orientations and, of course, a common grain boundary, as indicated inFigure 7.14. During plastic deformation, slip or dislocation motion must take place188 •Chapter 7 / Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms Grain boundary Slip plane Grain A Grain BFigure 7.14 The motion of a dislocation as it encounters a grain boundary, illustrating how the boundary acts as a barrier to continued slip.

The grain boundary acts as a barrier to dislocation motion for two reasons: 1.Since the two grains are of different orientations, a dislocation passing intograin B will have to change its direction of motion; this becomes more diffi-cult as the crystallographic misorientation increases.

misorientation increases. 2.The atomic disorder within a grain boundary region will result in a disconti-nuity of slip planes from one grain into the other. It should be mentioned that, for high-angle grain boundaries, it may not be the casethat dislocations traverse grain boundaries during deformation; rather, dislocationstend to “pile up” (or back up) at grain boundaries. These pile-ups introduce stressconcentrations ahead of their slip planes, which generate new dislocations in adja-cent grains. A fine-grained material (one that has small grains) is harder and stronger than one that is coarse grained, since the former has a greater total grain boundary areato impede dislocation motion. For many materials, the yield strength varies withgrain size according to (7.7) In this expression, termed the Hall-Petch equation, d is the average grain diameter, and and are constants for a particular material. Note that Equation 7.7 is notvalid for both very large (i.e., coarse) grain and extremely fine grain polycrystallinematerials. Figure 7.15 demonstrates the yield strength dependence on grain size fora brass alloy. Grain size may be regulated by the rate of solidification from the liq-uid phase, and also by plastic deformation followed by an appropriate heat treat-ment, as discussed in Section 7.13. It should also be mentioned that grain size reduction improves not only strength, but also the toughness of many alloys. Small-angle grain boundaries (Section 4.6) are not effective in interfering with the slip process because of the slight crystallographic misalignment across theboundary.

Boundaries between two different phases are also impediments to movements of dislocations; this is important in thestrengthening of more complex alloys.The sizes and shapes of the constituent phasessignificantly affect the mechanical properties of multiphase alloys; these are the top-ics of discussion in Sections 10.7, 10.8, and 16.1. 7.9 SOLID-SOLUTION STRENGTHENING Another technique to strengthen and harden metals is alloying with impurity atomsthat go into either substitutional or interstitial solid solution. Accordingly, this iscalled solid-solution strengthening. High-purity metals are almost always softer and weaker than alloys composed of the same base metal. Increasing the concentrationof the impurity results in an attendant increase in tensile and yield strengths, as in-dicated in Figures 7.16 aand 7.16b for nickel in copper; the dependence of ductil- ity on nickel concentration is presented in Figure 7.16 c. Alloys are stronger than pure metals because impurity atoms that go into solid solution ordinarily impose lattice strains on the surrounding host atoms. Lattice strainfield interactions between dislocations and these impurity atoms result, and, conse-quently, dislocation movement is restricted.

is restricted. For example, an impurity atom that issmaller than a host atom for which it substitutes exerts tensile strains on the sur-rounding crystal lattice, as illustrated in Figure 7.17 a.Conversely, a larger substitutional190 •Chapter 7 / Dislocations and Strengthening MechanismsTensile strength (MPa) Yield strength (MPa)Tensile strength (ksi)Elongation (% in 2 in. )400 300 200180 160140120100 80 60 0 1 02 03 04 05 0 60 50 40 30 2060 50 40 30 Yield strength (ksi)20 Nickel content (wt%)0 1 02 03 04 05 025 15 10 Nickel content (wt%) 0 1 02 03 04 05 0 Nickel content (wt%)(a) (b) (c)Figure 7.16 Variation with nickel content of (a) tensile strength, (b) yield strength, and (c) ductility (%EL) for copper–nickel alloys, showing strengthening.solid-solution strengthening1496T_c07_174-206 1/9/06 12:56 Page 1902nd REVISE PAGESatom imposes compressive strains in its vicinity (Figure 7.18 a).These solute atoms tend to diffuse to and segregate around dislocations in a way so as to reduce the overall strain energy—that is, to cancel some of the strain in the lattice surrounding a dislo-cation. To accomplish this, a smaller impurity atom is located where its tensile strainwill partially nullify some of the dislocation’s compressive strain. For the edge dislo-cation in Figure 7.17 b, this would be adjacent to the dislocation line and above the slip plane. A larger impurity atom would be situated as in Figure 7.18 b. The resistance to slip is greater when impurity atoms are present because the overall lattice strain must increase if a dislocation is torn away from them.

from them. Fur-thermore, the same lattice strain interactions (Figures 7.17 band 7.18b) will exist between impurity atoms and dislocations that are in motion during plastic defor-mation. Thus, a greater applied stress is necessary to first initiate and then continueplastic deformation for solid-solution alloys, as opposed to pure metals; this is evi-denced by the enhancement of strength and hardness. 7.10 STRAIN HARDENING Strain hardening is the phenomenon whereby a ductile metal becomes harder and stronger as it is plastically deformed. Sometimes it is also called work hardening, or, because the temperature at which deformation takes place is “cold” relative tothe absolute melting temperature of the metal, cold working. Most metals strain harden at room temperature. It is sometimes convenient to express the degree of plastic deformation as per- cent cold work rather than as strain. Percent cold work (%CW) is defined as (7.8) where is the original area of the cross section that experiences deformation, and is the area after deformation.A dA0%CW /H11005aA0/H11002Ad A0b/H110031007.10 Strain Hardening •191 (b)(a)Figure 7.17 (a) Representation of tensile lattice strains imposed on host atoms by a smallersubstitutional impurity atom.

Strain hardening is demonstrated in a stress–strain diagram presented earlier (Figure 6.17). Initially, the metal with yield strength is plastically deformed to pointD. The stress is released, then reapplied with a resultant new yield strength, . Themetal has thus become stronger during the process because is greater than . The strain-hardening phenomenon is explained on the basis of dislocation– dislocation strain field interactions similar to those discussed in Section 7.3. Thedislocation density in a metal increases with deformation or cold work, due to dislo-cation multiplication or the formation of new dislocations, as noted previously. Con- sequently, the average distance of separation between dislocations decreases—thedislocations are positioned closer together. On the average, dislocation–dislocationstrain interactions are repulsive. The net result is that the motion of a dislocationis hindered by the presence of other dislocations. As the dislocation density in-creases, this resistance to dislocation motion by other dislocations becomes morepronounced. Thus, the imposed stress necessary to deform a metal increases withincreasing cold work. Strain hardening is often utilized commercially to enhance the mechanical prop- erties of metals during fabrication procedures. The effects of strain hardening maybe removed by an annealing heat treatment, as discussed in Section 11.7. In passing, for the mathematical expression relating true stress and strain, Equation 6.19, the parameter nis called the strain-hardening exponent, which is a measure of the ability of a metal to strain harden; the larger its magnitude, thegreater the strain hardening for a given amount of plastic strain.

Solution It is first necessary to determine the percent cold work resulting from the deformation. This is possible using Equation 7.8: The tensile strength is read directly from the curve for copper (Figure 7.19 b) as 340 MPa (50,000 psi). From Figure 7.19 c, the ductility at 35.6%CW is about 7%EL.

about 7%EL. In summary, we have just discussed the three mechanisms that may be used to strengthen and harden single-phase metal alloys: strengthening by grain size re- duction, solid-solution strengthening, and strain hardening. Of course they may beused in conjunction with one another; for example, a solid-solution strengthenedalloy may also be strain hardened. It should also be noted that the strengthening effects due to grain size reduc- tion and strain hardening can be eliminated or at least reduced by an elevated-temperature heat treatment (Sections 7.12 and 7.13). Conversely, solid-solutionstrengthening is unaffected by heat treatment. Recovery, Recrystallization, and Grain Growth As outlined in the preceding paragraphs of this chapter, plastically deforming a poly-crystalline metal specimen at temperatures that are low relative to its absolute melt-ing temperature produces microstructural and property changes that include (1) achange in grain shape (Section 7.6), (2) strain hardening (Section 7.10), and (3) an in-crease in dislocation density (Section 7.3). Some fraction of the energy expended indeformation is stored in the metal as strain energy, which is associated with tensile,compressive, and shear zones around the newly created dislocations (Section 7.3).%CW /H11005a15.2 mm 2b2 p/H11002a12.2 mm 2b2 p a15.2 mm 2b2 p/H11003100/H1100535.6%1496T_c07_174-206 11/17/05 13:32 Page 194REVISED PAGESFurthermore, other properties such as electrical conductivity (Section 18.8) and cor- rosion resistance may be modified as a consequence of plastic deformation. These properties and structures may revert back to the precold-worked states by appropriate heat treatment (sometimes termed an annealing treatment).

annealing treatment). Suchrestoration results from two different processes that occur at elevated temperatures:recovery and recrystallization, which may be followed by grain growth. 7.11 RECOVERY During recovery, some of the stored internal strain energy is relieved by virtue of dislocation motion (in the absence of an externally applied stress), as a result of en-hanced atomic diffusion at the elevated temperature. There is some reduction inthe number of dislocations, and dislocation configurations (similar to that shown inFigure 4.8) are produced having low strain energies. In addition, physical proper-ties such as electrical and thermal conductivities and the like are recovered to theirprecold-worked states. 7.12 RECRYSTALLIZATION Even after recovery is complete, the grains are still in a relatively high strain en-ergy state. Recrystallization is the formation of a new set of strain-free and equiaxed grains (i.e., having approximately equal dimensions in all directions) that have lowdislocation densities and are characteristic of the precold-worked condition. Thedriving force to produce this new grain structure is the difference in internal en-ergy between the strained and unstrained material. The new grains form as verysmall nuclei and grow until they completely consume the parent material, processesthat involve short-range diffusion. Several stages in the recrystallization processare represented in Figures 7.21 ato 7.21d; in these photomicrographs, the small7.12 Recrystallization •195 recrystallizationrecovery (a) (b) Figure 7.21 Photomicrographs showing several stages of the recrystallization and grain growth of brass.

Thus, recrystallization of cold- worked metals may be used to refine the grain structure. Also, during recrystallization, the mechanical properties that were changed as a result of cold working are restored to their precold-worked values; that is, themetal becomes softer, weaker, yet more ductile. Some heat treatments are designedto allow recrystallization to occur with these modifications in the mechanical char-acteristics (Section 11.7). Recrystallization is a process the extent of which depends on both time and temperature. The degree (or fraction) of recrystallization increases with time, asmay be noted in the photomicrographs shown in Figures 7.21 a–d.

presented schematically. The recrystallization behavior of a particular metal alloy is sometimes specified in terms of a recrystallization temperature, the temperature at which recrystalliza- tion just reaches completion in 1 h. Thus, the recrystallization temperature for thebrass alloy of Figure 7.22 is about Typically, it is between one-third and one-half of the absolute melting temperature of a metal or alloy and dependson several factors, including the amount of prior cold work and the purity of thealloy. Increasing the percentage of cold work enhances the rate of recrystallization,with the result that the recrystallization temperature is lowered, and approaches aconstant or limiting value at high deformations; this effect is shown in Figure 7.23.Furthermore, it is this limiting or minimum recrystallization temperature that isnormally specified in the literature. There exists some critical degree of cold workbelow which recrystallization cannot be made to occur, as shown in the figure; nor-mally, this is between 2% and 20% cold work. Recrystallization proceeds more rapidly in pure metals than in alloys. During recrystallization, grain-boundary motion occurs as the new grain nuclei form andthen grow.

It is required to have a cold-worked yield strength of at least 345 MPa(50,000 psi) and a ductility in excess of 20%EL; in addition, a final diameter of5.1 mm (0.20 in.) is necessary. Describe the manner in which this procedure maybe carried out.

carried out. Solution Let us first consider the consequences (in terms of yield strength and ductility) of cold working in which the brass specimen diameter is reduced from 6.4 mm (des-ignated by ) to 5.1 mm ( ). The %CW may be computed from Equation 7.8 as From Figures 7.19 aand 7.19c, a yield strength of 410 MPa (60,000 psi) and a duc- tility of 8%EL are attained from this deformation. According to the stipulated criteria, the yield strength is satisfactory; however, the ductility is too low. Another processing alternative is a partial diameter reduction, followed by a recrystallization heat treatment in which the effects of the cold work are nul-lified. The required yield strength, ductility, and diameter are achieved througha second drawing step. Again, reference to Figure 7.19 aindicates that 20%CW is required to give a yield strength of 345 MPa. On the other hand, from Figure 7.19 c, ductilities greater than 20%EL are possible only for deformations of 23%CW or less. Thusduring the final drawing operation, deformation must be between 20%CW and23%CW. Let’s take the average of these extremes, 21.5%CW, and then calculatethe final diameter for the first drawing which becomes the original diameterfor the second drawing.

grain growth. Grain growth does not need to be preceded by recov- ery and recrystallization; it may occur in all polycrystalline materials, metals andceramics alike. An energy is associated with grain boundaries, as explained in Section 4.6. As grains increase in size, the total boundary area decreases, yielding an attendantreduction in the total energy; this is the driving force for grain growth. Grain growth occurs by the migration of grain boundaries. Obviously, not all grains can enlarge, but large ones grow at the expense of small ones that shrink.Thus, the average grain size increases with time, and at any particular instant therewill exist a range of grain sizes. Boundary motion is just the short-range diffusionof atoms from one side of the boundary to the other. The directions of boundarymovement and atomic motion are opposite to each other, as shown in Figure 7.24. For many polycrystalline materials, the grain diameter dvaries with time t according to the relationship (7.9) where is the initial grain diameter at and Kand nare time-independent constants; the value of n is generally equal to or greater than 2. The dependence of grain size on time and temperature is demonstrated in Figure 7.25, a plot of the logarithm of grain size as a function of the logarithm oftime for a brass alloy at several temperatures. At lower temperatures the curves arelinear. Furthermore, grain growth proceeds more rapidly as temperature increases;that is, the curves are displaced upward to larger grain sizes.

If the grain structure of a single-phase alloy is coarser than that desired, refinementmay be accomplished by plastically deforming the material, then subjecting it to arecrystallization heat treatment, as described above. SUMMARY Basic ConceptsSlip Systems On a microscopic level, plastic deformation corresponds to the motion of disloca- tions in response to an externally applied shear stress, a process termed “slip.” Slipoccurs on specific crystallographic planes and within these planes only in certaindirections. A slip system represents a slip plane–slip direction combination, andoperable slip systems depend on the crystal structure of the material. Slip in Single Crystals The critical resolved shear stress is the minimum shear stress required to initiate dislocation motion; the yield strength of a single crystal depends on both the mag-nitude of the critical resolved shear stress and the orientation of slip componentsrelative to the direction of the applied stress. Plastic Deformation of Polycrystalline Materials For polycrystalline materials, slip occurs within each grain along the slip systems that are most favorably oriented with the applied stress; furthermore, during de-formation, grains change shape in such a manner that coherency at the grain bound-aries is maintained. Deformation by Twinning Under some circumstances limited plastic deformation may occur in BCC and HCP metals by mechanical twinning. Normally, twinning is important to the degree thataccompanying crystallographic reorientations make the slip process more favorable.Summary •201 Time (min) (Logarithmic scale)Grain diameter (mm) (Logarithmic scale) 11 0850/H11034C800/H11034C 700/H11034C 600/H11034C 500/H11034C 1021041030.010.11.0Figure 7.25 The logarithm of grain diameter versus the logarithm of time for grain growth in brass at several temperatures.

Onthe basis of this principle, three different strengthening mechanisms were discussed.Grain boundaries serve as barriers to dislocation motion; thus refining the grain sizeof a polycrystalline material renders it harder and stronger. Solid-solution strength-ening results from lattice strain interactions between impurity atoms and dislocations.Finally, as a material is plastically deformed, the dislocation density increases, as doesalso the extent of repulsive dislocation–dislocation strain field interactions; strain hard-ening is just the enhancement of strength with increased plastic deformation. Recovery RecrystallizationGrain Growth The microstructural and mechanical characteristics of a plastically deformed metal specimen may be restored to their predeformed states by an appropriate heat treat-ment, during which recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth processes are al-lowed to occur. During recovery there is a reduction in dislocation density andalterations in dislocation configurations. Recrystallization is the formation of a newset of grains that are strain free; in addition, the material becomes softer and moreductile. Grain growth is the increase in average grain size of polycrystalline mate-rials, which proceeds by grain boundary motion.202 •Chapter 7 / Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS Cold workingCritical resolved shear stressDislocation densityGrain growthLattice strainRecoveryRecrystallizationRecrystallization temperatureResolved shear stressSlipSlip systemSolid-solution strengtheningStrain hardening QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS Basic ConceptsCharacteristics of Dislocations 7.1To provide some perspective on the dimen-sions of atomic defects, consider a metal spec-imen that has a dislocation density of Suppose that all the dislocations in were somehow removed and linked end to end.

(Photography by Neal Boenzi. Reprinted with permission from The New York Times .) The design of a component or structure often calls upon the engineer to minimize the possibility of fail-ure. Thus, it is important to understand the mechanicsof the various failure modes—i.e., fracture, fatigue,and creep—and, in addition, be familiar with appro-priate design principles that may be employed toprevent in-service failures. For example, we discussin Sections 22.4 through 22.6 material selection andprocessing issues relating to the fatigue of an automo-bile valve spring.WHY STUDY Failure? 1496T_c08_207-251 12/21/05 8:28 Page 2072nd REVISE PAGES8.1 INTRODUCTION The failure of engineering materials is almost always an undesirable event for several reasons; these include human lives that are put in jeopardy, economic losses, and the in-terference with the availability of products and services. Even though the causes of fail-ure and the behavior of materials may be known, prevention of failures is difficult toguarantee. The usual causes are improper materials selection and processing and in-adequate design of the component or its misuse. It is the responsibility of the engineerto anticipate and plan for possible failure and, in the event that failure does occur, toassess its cause and then take appropriate preventive measures against future incidents. The following topics are addressed in this chapter: simple fracture (both duc- tile and brittle modes), fundamentals of fracture mechanics, impact fracture testing,the ductile-to-brittle transition, fatigue, and creep.

and creep. These discussions include failuremechanisms, testing techniques, and methods by which failure may be prevented orcontrolled.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Fracture 8.2 FUNDAMENTALS OF FRACTURE Simple fracture is the separation of a body into two or more pieces in response toan imposed stress that is static (i.e., constant or slowly changing with time) and attemperatures that are low relative to the melting temperature of the material. Theapplied stress may be tensile, compressive, shear, or torsional; the present discussionwill be confined to fractures that result from uniaxial tensile loads. For engineeringmaterials, two fracture modes are possible: ductile and brittle. Classification is based on the ability of a material to experience plastic deformation. Ductile materials typ-ically exhibit substantial plastic deformation with high energy absorption beforefracture. On the other hand, there is normally little or no plastic deformation withLearning Objectives After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1.Describe the mechanism of crack propagation for both ductile and brittle modes of fracture. 2.Explain why the strengths of brittle materials aremuch lower than predicted by theoretical calcu-lations. 3.Define fracture toughness in terms of (a) a briefstatement, and (b) an equation; define all pa-rameters in this equation. 4.Make a distinction between fracture toughness and plane strain fracture toughness. 5.Name and describe the two impact fracturetesting techniques.6.Define fatigue and specify the conditions under which it occurs. 7.From a fatigue plot for some material, deter-mine (a) the fatigue lifetime (at a specifiedstress level), and (b) the fatigue strength (at aspecified number of cycles).

The tensile stress–strain behaviors of both fracture types may be reviewed in Figure 6.13. “Ductile”and “brittle” are relative terms; whether a particular fracture is one mode or the other depends on the situation. Ductility may be quantified in termsof percent elongation (Equation 6.11) and percent reduction in area (Equation6.12). Furthermore, ductility is a function of temperature of the material, the strainrate, and the stress state. The disposition of normally ductile materials to fail in abrittle manner is discussed in Section 8.6. Any fracture process involves two steps—crack formation and propagation—in response to an imposed stress.The mode of fracture is highly dependent on the mech-anism of crack propagation. Ductile fracture is characterized by extensive plastic de-formation in the vicinity of an advancing crack. Furthermore, the process proceedsrelatively slowly as the crack length is extended. Such a crack is often said to be stable. That is, it resists any further extension unless there is an increase in the applied stress.In addition, there will ordinarily be evidence of appreciable gross deformation at thefracture surfaces (e.g., twisting and tearing). On the other hand, for brittle fracture,cracks may spread extremely rapidly, with very little accompanying plastic deforma-tion. Such cracks may be said to be unstable, and crack propagation, once started, will continue spontaneously without an increase in magnitude of the applied stress. Ductile fracture is almost always preferred for two reasons.

two reasons. First, brittle frac- ture occurs suddenly and catastrophically without any warning; this is a consequenceof the spontaneous and rapid crack propagation. On the other hand, for ductile frac-ture, the presence of plastic deformation gives warning that fracture is imminent,allowing preventive measures to be taken. Second, more strain energy is requiredto induce ductile fracture inasmuch as ductile materials are generally tougher. Underthe action of an applied tensile stress, most metal alloys are ductile, whereas ceramicsare notably brittle, and polymers may exhibit both types of fracture. 8.3 DUCTILE FRACTURE Ductile fracture surfaces will have their own distinctive features on both macroscopicand microscopic levels. Figure 8.1 shows schematic representations for two charac-teristic macroscopic fracture profiles. The configuration shown in Figure 8.1 ais found for extremely soft metals, such as pure gold and lead at room temperature, and othermetals, polymers, and inorganic glasses at elevated temperatures. These highly duc-tile materials neck down to a point fracture, showing virtually 100% reduction in area. The most common type of tensile fracture profile for ductile metals is that rep- resented in Figure 8.1 b, where fracture is preceded by only a moderate amount of8.3 Ductile Fracture •209 (a) (b) (c)Figure 8.1 (a) Highly ductile fracture in which the specimen necks down to a point.

The fracture process normally occurs in several stages (Figure 8.2). First, after necking begins, small cavities, or microvoids, form in the interior of the crosssection, as indicated in Figure 8.2 b.

8.2 b. Next, as deformation continues, these microvoids enlarge, come together, and coalesce to form an elliptical crack, which has its longaxis perpendicular to the stress direction. The crack continues to grow in a directionparallel to its major axis by this microvoid coalescence process (Figure 8.2 c). Finally, fracture ensues by the rapid propagation of a crack around the outer perimeter ofthe neck (Figure 8.2 d), by shear deformation at an angle of about with the ten- sile axis—this is the angle at which the shear stress is a maximum. Sometimes a frac-ture having this characteristic surface contour is termed a cup-and-cone fracturebecause one of the mating surfaces is in the form of a cup, the other like a cone. Inthis type of fractured specimen (Figure 8.3 a), the central interior region of the surface has an irregular and fibrous appearance, which is indicative of plastic deformation.

The scanning electron microscope is preferred for fractographic examinations since it has a much better resolution and depth of field than does the optical microscope; these characteristics are necessary to reveal the top-ographical features of fracture surfaces. When the fibrous central region of a cup-and-cone fracture surface is examined with the electron microscope at a high magnification, it will be found to consist ofnumerous spherical “dimples” (Figure 8.4 a); this structure is characteristic of frac- ture resulting from uniaxial tensile failure. Each dimple is one half of a microvoidthat formed and then separated during the fracture process. Dimples also form onthe shear lip of the cup-and-cone fracture. However, these will be elongated orC-shaped, as shown in Figure 8.4 b. This parabolic shape may be indicative of shear failure. Furthermore, other microscopic fracture surface features are also possible.Fractographs such as those shown in Figures 8.4 aand 8.4b provide valuable infor- mation in the analyses of fracture, such as the fracture mode, the stress state, andthe site of crack initiation. 8.4 BRITTLE FRACTURE Brittle fracture takes place without any appreciable deformation, and by rapid crackpropagation. The direction of crack motion is very nearly perpendicular to the di-rection of the applied tensile stress and yields a relatively flat fracture surface, asindicated in Figure 8.1 c. Fracture surfaces of materials that failed in a brittle manner will have their own distinctive patterns; any signs of gross plastic deformation will be absent. Forexample, in some steel pieces, a series of V-shaped “chevron” markings may formnear the center of the fracture cross section that point back toward the crack initi-ation site (F igure 8.5a ).

8.5a ). Other brittle fracture surfaces contain lines or ridges that radiate from the origin of the crack in a fanlike pattern (Figure 8.5 b). Often, both of these marking patterns will be sufficiently coarse to be discerned with the nakedeye. For very hard and fine-grained metals, there will be no discernible fracture pat-tern. Brittle fracture in amorphous materials, such as ceramic glasses, yields a rela-tively shiny and smooth surface.45/H110348.4 Brittle Fracture •211 Figure 8.4 (a) Scanning electron fractograph showing spherical dimples characteristic of ductile fracture resulting from uniaxial tensile loads. 3300/H11003 .

This type of fracture is said to be transgranular (or transcrystalline), because the fracture cracks pass through the grains. Macroscopically, the fracture surface may have a grainy or faceted texture(Figure 8.3 b), as a result of changes in orientation of the cleavage planes from grain to grain. This cleavage feature is shown at a higher magnification in the scanningelectron micrograph of Figure 8.6 b. In some alloys, crack propagation is along grain boundaries (Figure 8.7 a); this fracture is termed intergranular.

This type of fracture normally results subsequent to theoccurrence of processes that weaken or embrittle grain boundary regions. 8.5 PRINCIPLES OF FRACTURE MECHANICS Brittle fracture of normally ductile materials, such as that shown in the chapter-opening photograph for this chapter, has demonstrated the need for a better un-derstanding of the mechanisms of fracture. Extensive research endeavors overthe past several decades have led to the evolution of the field of fracture me- chanics. This subject allows quantification of the relationships between material properties, stress level, the presence of crack-producing flaws, and crack propa-gation mechanisms. Design engineers are now better equipped to anticipate, and thus prevent, structural failures. The present discussion centers on some of the fundamental principles of the mechanics of fracture. Stress Concentration The measured fracture strengths for most brittle materials are significantly lowerthan those predicted by theoretical calculations based on atomic bonding ener-gies.This discrepancy is explained by the presence of very small, microscopic flawsor cracks that always exist under normal conditions at the surface and within theinterior of a body of material. These flaws are a detriment to the fracture strengthbecause an applied stress may be amplified or concentrated at the tip, the mag-nitude of this amplification depending on crack orientation and geometry. Thisphenomenon is demonstrated in Figure 8.8, a stress profile across a cross sectioncontaining an internal crack. As indicated by this profile, the magnitude of thislocalized stress diminishes with distance away from the crack tip.

Due to their abil-ity to amplify an applied stress in their locale, these flaws are sometimes calledstress raisers. If it is assumed that a crack is similar to an elliptical hole through a plate, and is oriented perpendicular to the applied stress, the maximum stress, occurs atthe crack tip and may be approximated by (8.1) where is the magnitude of the nominal applied tensile stress, is the radius ofcurvature of the crack tip (Figure 8.8 a), and arepresents the length of a surface crack, or half of the length of an internal crack. For a relatively long microcrackthat has a small tip radius of curvature, the factor may be very large. Thiswill yield a value of that is many times the value of Sometimes the ratio is denoted as the stress concentration factor (8.2) which is simply a measure of the degree to which an external stress is amplified atthe tip of a crack. By way of comment, it should be said that stress amplification is not restricted to these microscopic defects; it may occur at macroscopic internal discontinuities(e.g., voids), at sharp corners, and at notches in large structures.

large structures. Furthermore, the effect of a stress raiser is more significant in brittle than in ductile materials. For a ductile material, plastic deformation ensues when the max-imum stress exceeds the yield strength. This leads to a more uniform distributionof stress in the vicinity of the stress raiser and to the development of a maximumstress concentration factor less than the theoretical value. Such yielding and stressredistribution do not occur to any appreciable extent around flaws and discontinu-ities in brittle materials; therefore, essentially the theoretical stress concentrationwill result. Using principles of fracture mechanics, it is possible to show that the critical stress required for crack propagation in a brittle material is described by theexpression (8.3) where All brittle materials contain a population of small cracks and flaws that have a variety of sizes, geometries, and orientations. When the magnitude of a tensile stressat the tip of one of these flaws exceeds the value of this critical stress, a crack formsand then propagates, which results in fracture. Very small and virtually defect-freemetallic and ceramic whiskers have been grown with fracture strengths that approachtheir theoretical values. a/H11005 one half the length of an internal crack g s/H11005 specific surface energy E/H11005 modulus of elasticitysc/H11005a2Egs pab1/H114082scKt/H11005sm s0/H110052 aa rtb1/H114082Kt: sm/H11408s0s0. sm1a/H11408rt21/H114082rt s0sm/H110052s0 aa rtb1/H114082sm,s0,216 •Chapter 8 / Failure Critical stress for crack propagation ina brittle material1496T_c08_207-251 11/18/05 11:50 Page 216REVISED PAGESEXAMPLE PROBLEM 8.1 Maximum Flaw Length Computation A relatively large plate of a glass is subjected to a tensile stress of 40 MPa.

Worth noting is that has the unusual units of or (alternatively, ). Further- more, Yis a dimensionless parameter or function that depends on both crack and specimen sizes and geometries, as well as the manner of load application. Relative to this Y parameter, for planar specimens containing cracks that are much shorter than the specimen width, Yhas a value of approximately unity.

For relatively thin specimens, the value of will depend on specimen thick- ness. However, when specimen thickness is much greater than the crack dimensions, becomes independent of thickness; under these conditions a condition of plane strain exists. By plane strain we mean that when a load operates on a crack in the manner represented in Figure 8.9 a, there is no strain component perpendicular to the front and back faces. The value for this thick-specimen situation is known as the plane strain fracture toughness furthermore, it is also defined by (8.5) is the fracture toughness cited for most situations. The I(i.e., Roman numeral “one”) subscript for denotes that the plane strain fracture toughness is for modeI crack displacement, as illustrated in Figure 8.10 a. 1 Brittle materials, for which appreciable plastic deformation is not possible in front of an advancing crack, have low values and are vulnerable to catastrophicfailure. On the other hand, values are relatively large for ductile materials. Frac-ture mechanics is especially useful in predicting catastrophic failure in materialshaving intermediate ductilities. Plane strain fracture toughness values for a numberof different materials are presented in Table 8.1 (and Figure 1.6); a more extensivelist of values is contained in Table B.5, Appendix B. The plane strain fracture toughness is a fundamental material property that depends on many factors, the most influential of which are temperature, strain rate,and microstructure. The magnitude of diminishes with increasing strain rate anddecreasing temperature.

Design Using Fracture Mechanics According to Equations 8.4 and 8.5, three variables must be considered relative to the possibility for fracture of some structural component—namely, the fracturetoughness ( ) or plane strain fracture toughness ( ), the imposed stress andthe flaw size (a)—assuming, of course, that Yhas been determined.

For example,material selection (and hence or ) is often dictated by factors such as density(for lightweight applications) or the corrosion characteristics of the environment.Or, the allowable flaw size is either measured or specified by the limitations ofavailable flaw detection techniques. It is important to realize, however, that onceany combination of two of the above parameters is prescribed, the third becomesfixed (Equations 8.4 and 8.5).

Furthermore,some testing methods must be conducted in a laboratory setting; others may beadapted for use in the field. Several commonly employed NDT techniques and theircharacteristics are listed in Table 8.2. One important example of the use of NDT is for the detection of cracks and leaks in the walls of oil pipelines in remote areas such as Alaska.

Using principles of fracture mechanics, allowance is made for the growth of a crack through the thickness of the vessel wall prior to the occurrence of rapid crack propagation (Figure 8.11).Thus, the crack will com-pletely penetrate the wall without catastrophic failure, allowing for its detectionby the leaking of pressurized fluid. With this criterion the critical crack length (i.e., one-half of the total internal crack length) is taken to be equal to the pres-sure vessel thickness t. Allowance for instead of assures that fluid leakage will occur prior to the buildup of dangerously high pressures. Using thiscriterion, rank the metal alloys in Table B.5, Appendix B as to the maximumallowable pressure.

of mate-rials. It was realized that the results of laboratory tensile tests could not be extrap-olated to predict fracture behavior; for example, under some circumstances normallyductile metals fracture abruptly and with very little plastic deformation. Impact testconditions were chosen to represent those most severe relative to the potential forfracture—namely, (1) deformation at a relatively low temperature, (2) a high strainrate (i.e., rate of deformation), and (3) a triaxial stress state (which may be intro-duced by the presence of a notch). Impact Testing Techniques Two standardized tests,4the Charpy and Izod, were designed and are still used to measure the impact energy, sometimes also termed notch toughness. The Charpy V-notch (CVN) technique is most commonly used in the United States. For bothCharpy and Izod, the specimen is in the shape of a bar of square cross section, intowhich a V-notch is machined (Figure 8.12 a). The apparatus for making V-notch impact tests is illustrated schematically in Figure 8.12 b. The load is applied as an impact blow from a weighted pendulum hammer that is released from a cockedposition at a fixed height h. The specimen is positioned at the base as shown. Uponrelease, a knife edge mounted on the pendulum strikes and fractures the specimenat the notch, which acts as a point of stress concentration for this high-velocity8.6 Impact Fracture Testing •223 Table 8.4 Ranking of Several Metal AlloysRelative to Maximum AllowablePressure (Leak-Before-BreakCriterion) for a Thin-Walled Spherical Pressure Vessel Material(MPa-m) Medium carbon (1040) steel 11.2 4140 steel 6.1 (tempered @ ) Ti-5Al-2.5Sn titanium 5.8 2024 aluminum (T3) 5.6 4340 steel 5.4 (tempered @ ) 17-7PH steel 4.4 AZ31B magnesium 3.9 Ti-6Al-4V titanium 3.3 4140 steel 2.4 (tempered @ C) 4340 steel 1.5 (tempered @ ) 7075 aluminum (T651) 1.2260/H11034C370/H11034425/H11034C482/H11034CKIc2 Sy 4 ASTM Standard E 23, “Standard Test Methods for Notched Bar Impact Testing of Metallic Materials.”Charpy, Izod tests impact energy1496T_c08_207-251 11/18/05 11:50 Page 223REVISED PAGESimpact blow.

design purposes. Impactenergies are of interest mainly in a relative sense and for making comparisons—absolute values are of little significance. Attempts have been made to correlateplane strain fracture toughnesses and CVN energies, with only limited success. Planestrain fracture toughness tests are not as simple to perform as impact tests; fur-thermore, equipment and specimens are more expensive. Ductile-to-Brittle Transition One of the primary functions of Charpy and Izod tests is to determine whether ornot a material experiences a ductile-to-brittle transition with decreasing tempera- ture and, if so, the range of temperatures over which it occurs. The ductile-to-brittletransition is related to the temperature dependence of the measured impact energyabsorption. This transition is represented for a steel by curve Ain Figure 8.13. At higher temperatures the CVN energy is relatively large, in correlation with a duc-tile mode of fracture. As the temperature is lowered, the impact energy drops sud-denly over a relatively narrow temperature range, below which the energy has aconstant but small value; that is, the mode of fracture is brittle. Alternatively, appearance of the failure surface is indicative of the nature of fracture and may be used in transition temperature determinations. For ductile frac-ture this surface appears fibrous or dull (or of shear character), as in the steel spec-imen of Figure 8.14 that was tested at Conversely, totally brittle surfaces havea granular (shiny) texture (or cleavage character) (the specimen, Figure 8.14).Over the ductile-to-brittle transition, features of both types will exist (in Figure 8.14,displayed by specimens tested at and ).

No explicit criterion has been established,and so this temperature is often defined as that temperature at which the CVNenergy assumes some value (e.g., 20 J or 15 ft-lb f), or corresponding to some given fracture appearance (e.g., 50% fibrous fracture). Matters are further complicatedinasmuch as a different transition temperature may be realized for each of thesecriteria. Perhaps the most conservative transition temperature is that at which thefracture surface becomes 100% fibrous; on this basis, the transition temperature isapproximately for the steel alloy that is the subject of Figure 8.13. Structures constructed from alloys that exhibit this ductile-to-brittle behavior should be used only at temperatures above the transition temperature, to avoid brit-tle and catastrophic failure. Classic examples of this type of failure occurred, with dis-astrous consequences, during World War II when a number of welded transport ships,away from combat,suddenly and precipitously split in half.The vessels were constructedof a steel alloy that possessed adequate ductility according to room-temperature ten-sile tests.The brittle fractures occurred at relatively low ambient temperatures, at about in the vicinity of the transition temperature of the alloy. Each fracture crack originated at some point of stress concentration, probably a sharp corner or fab-rication defect, and then propagated around the entire girth of the ship. In addition to the ductile-to-brittle transition represented in Figure 8.13, two other general types of impact energy-versus-temperature behavior have been observed; theseare represented schematically by the upper and lower curves of Figure 8.15.

For high-strength materials (e.g., high-strengthsteels and titanium alloys), the impact energy is also relatively insensitive to tem-perature (the lower curve of Figure 8.15); however, these materials are also verybrittle, as reflected by their low impact energy values. And, of course, the charac-teristic ductile-to-brittle transition is represented by the middle curve of Figure 8.15.As noted, this behavior is typically found in low-strength steels that have the BCCcrystal structure. For these low-strength steels, the transition temperature is sensitive to both alloy composition and microstructure.

and microstructure. For example, decreasing the average grain size re-sults in a lowering of the transition temperature. Hence, refining the grain size bothstrengthens (Section 7.8) and toughens steels. In contrast, increasing the carbon con-tent, while increasing the strength of steels, also raises the CVN transition of steels,as indicated in Figure 8.16. Most ceramics and polymers also experience a ductile-to-brittle transition. For ceramic materials, the transition occurs only at elevated temperatures, ordinarilyin excess of This behavior as related to polymers is discussed in Section 15.6. Fatigue Fatigue is a form of failure that occurs in structures subjected to dynamic and fluc- tuating stresses (e.g., bridges, aircraft, and machine components). Under these cir-cumstances it is possible for failure to occur at a stress level considerably lower thanthe tensile or yield strength for a static load. The term “fatigue” is used because thistype of failure normally occurs after a lengthy period of repeated stress or straincycling.

Furthermore, fatigue is catastrophic and insidious, occurring very suddenly and without warning. Fatigue failure is brittlelike in nature even in normally ductile metals, in that there is very little, if any, gross plastic deformation associated with failure. Theprocess occurs by the initiation and propagation of cracks, and ordinarily the frac-ture surface is perpendicular to the direction of an applied tensile stress. 8.7 CYCLIC STRESSES The applied stress may be axial (tension-compression), flexural (bending), or torsional(twisting) in nature. In general, three different fluctuating stress–time modes are pos-sible. One is represented schematically by a regular and sinusoidal time dependencein Figure 8.17a , wherein the amplitude is symmetrical about a mean zero stress level, for example, alternating from a maximum tensile stress to a minimum com-pressive stress of equal magnitude; this is referred to as a reversed stress cycle.

Tests are also frequently conducted using an alternating uniaxialtension-compression stress cycle. A series of tests are commenced by subjecting a specimen to the stress cycling at a relatively large maximum stress amplitude ( ), usually on the order of two-thirds of the static tensile strength; the number of cycles to failure is counted. Thisprocedure is repeated on other specimens at progressively decreasing maximumstress amplitudes. Data are plotted as stress Sversus the logarithm of the number Nof cycles to failure for each of the specimens. The values of Sare normally taken as stress amplitudes ( Equation 8.16); on occasion, or values maybe used.

maybe used. Two distinct types of S–N behavior are observed, which are represented schematically in Figure 8.19. As these plots indicate, the higher the magnitude ofthe stress, the smaller the number of cycles the material is capable of sustainingbefore failure. For some ferrous (iron base) and titanium alloys, the S–N curve (Figure 8.19 a) becomes horizontal at higher Nvalues; or there is a limiting stress level, called the fatigue limit (also sometimes the endurance limit), below which fatigue failure will not occur. This fatigue limit represents the largest value of fluc-tuating stress that will not cause failure for essentially an infinite number of cycles. For many steels, fatigue limits range between 35% and 60% of the tensile strength. Most nonferrous alloys (e.g., aluminum, copper, magnesium) do not have a fatigue limit, in that the S–N curve continues its downward trend at increasingly greater Nvalues (Figure 8.19 b). Thus, fatigue will ultimately occur regardless of the magnitude of the stress. For these materials, the fatigue response is specified asfatigue strength, which is defined as the stress level at which failure will occur for some specified number of cycles (e.g., cycles). The determination of fatiguestrength is also demonstrated in Figure 8.19 b. Another important parameter that characterizes a material’s fatigue behavior is fatigue life It is the number of cycles to cause failure at a specified stress level, as taken from the S–N plot (Figure 8.19 b). Unfortunately, there always exists considerable scatter in fatigue data—that is, a variation in the measured Nvalue for a number of specimens tested at the same stress level. This variation may lead to significant design uncertainties when fatiguelife and/or fatigue limit (or strength) are being considered. The scatter in results isa consequence of the fatigue sensitivity to a number of test and material parame-ters that are impossible to control precisely.These parameters include specimen fab-rication and surface preparation, metallurgical variables, specimen alignment in theapparatus, mean stress, and test frequency.N f.107smin smax sa,smax230 •Chapter 8 / Failure Figure 8.18 Schematic diagram of fatigue-testing apparatus for making rotating- bending tests.

It is a little unset- tling to realize that approximately one-half of the specimens tested actually failedat stress levels lying nearly 25% below the curve (as determined on the basis ofstatistical treatments). Several statistical techniques have been developed to specify fatigue life and fatigue limit in terms of probabilities. One convenient way of representing datatreated in this manner is with a series of constant probability curves, several of whichare plotted in Figure 8.20. The Pvalue associated with each curve represents the probability of failure. For example, at a stress of 200 MPa (30,000 psi), we wouldexpect 1% of the specimens to fail at about cycles and 50% to fail at about cycles, and so on. Remember that S–N curves represented in the literature are normally average values, unless noted otherwise. The fatigue behaviors represented in Figures 8.19 aand 8.19b may be classified into two domains. One is associated with relatively high loads that produce not onlyelastic strain but also some plastic strain during each cycle. Consequently, fatiguelives are relatively short; this domain is termed low-cycle fatigue and occurs at less2/H1100310 71068.8 The S–N Curve •231 Cycles to failure, N (logarithmic scale)Stress amplitude, S 1031041051061071081091010Fatigue limit (a) Cycles to failure, N (logarithmic scale)Fatigue life at stress S1Stress amplitude, S 103104107N11081091010Fatigue strength at N1 cyclesS1 (b)Figure 8.19 Stress amplitude (S) versus logarithm of the number of cycles to fatigue failure (N) for (a) a material that displays a fatigue limit, and (b) a material that does not display a fatigue limit.1496T_c08_207-251 12/21/05 7:51 Page 2312nd REVISE PAGESthan about to cycles.

to cycles. For lower stress levels wherein deformations are totally elastic, longer lives result. This is called high-cycle fatigue inasmuch as relatively large numbers of cycles are required to produce fatigue failure. High-cycle fatigueis associated with fatigue lives greater than about to cycles. 8.9 CRACK INITIATION AND PROPAGATION The process of fatigue failure is characterized by three distinct steps: (1) crackinitiation, wherein a small crack forms at some point of high stress concentration;(2) crack propagation, during which this crack advances incrementally with eachstress cycle; and (3) final failure, which occurs very rapidly once the advancing crackhas reached a critical size. Cracks associated with fatigue failure almost always ini-tiate (or nucleate) on the surface of a component at some point of stress concen-tration. Crack nucleation sites include surface scratches, sharp fillets, keyways,threads, dents, and the like. In addition, cyclic loading can produce microscopic sur-face discontinuities resulting from dislocation slip steps that may also act as stressraisers, and therefore as crack initiation sites. The region of a fracture surface that formed during the crack propagation step may be characterized by two types of markings termed beachmarks and striations. Both of these features indicate the position of the crack tip at some point in timeand appear as concentric ridges that expand away from the crack initiation site(s),frequently in a circular or semicircular pattern. Beachmarks (sometimes also called“clamshell marks”) are of macroscopic dimensions (Figure 8.21), and may beobserved with the unaided eye. These markings are found for components thatexperienced interruptions during the crack propagation stage—for example, amachine that operated only during normal work-shift hours. Each beachmark bandrepresents a period of time over which crack growth occurred. On the other hand, fatigue striations are microscopic in size and subject to observation with the electron microscope (either TEM or SEM).

or SEM). Figure 8.22 is anelectron fractograph that shows this feature. Each striation is thought to representthe advance distance of a crack front during a single load cycle. Striation widthdepends on, and increases with, increasing stress range. At this point it should be emphasized that although both beachmarks and striations are fatigue fracture surface features having similar appearances, they are105104105104232 •Chapter 8 / Failure Figure 8.20 Fatigue S–N probability of failure curves for a 7075-T6 aluminum alloy; Pdenotes the probability of failure.

Some of these factors include mean stress level,geometrical design, surface effects, and metallurgical variables, as well as the envi-ronment. This section is devoted to a discussion of these factors and, in addition,to measures that may be taken to improve the fatigue resistance of structuralcomponents.

As may be noted, increasing the mean stresslevel leads to a decrease in fatigue life. Surface Effects For many common loading situations, the maximum stress within a component orstructure occurs at its surface. Consequently, most cracks leading to fatigue failureoriginate at surface positions, specifically at stress amplification sites. Therefore, ithas been observed that fatigue life is especially sensitive to the condition and con-figuration of the component surface. Numerous factors influence fatigue resistance,the proper management of which will lead to an improvement in fatigue life. Theseinclude design criteria as well as various surface treatments. Design Factors The design of a component can have a significant influence on its fatigue char-acteristics. Any notch or geometrical discontinuity can act as a stress raiser andfatigue crack initiation site; these design features include grooves, holes, keyways,threads, and so on. The sharper the discontinuity (i.e., the smaller the radius ofcurvature), the more severe the stress concentration. The probability of fatiguefailure may be reduced by avoiding (when possible) these structural irregulari-ties, or by making design modifications whereby sudden contour changes leadingto sharp corners are eliminated—for example, calling for rounded fillets with largeradii of curvature at the point where there is a change in diameter for a rotatingshaft (Figure 8.25).s m,(sm/H110050).8.10 Factors That Affect Fatigue Life •235 Cycles to failure, N (logarithmic scale)Stress amplitude, a/H9268/H9268m1 /H9268m1/H9268m2 /H9268m2>>/H9268m3 /H9268m3Figure 8.24 Demonstration of the influence of mean stress on S–N fatigue behavior.sm (a) (b)FilletFigure 8.25 Demonstration of how design can reduce stress amplification.

These surface markings can limitthe fatigue life. It has been observed that improving the surface finish by polishingwill enhance fatigue life significantly. One of the most effective methods of increasing fatigue performance is by imposing residual compressive stresses within a thin outer surface layer. Thus, asurface tensile stress of external origin will be partially nullified and reduced inmagnitude by the residual compressive stress. The net effect is that the likelihoodof crack formation and therefore of fatigue failure is reduced. Residual compressive stresses are commonly introduced into ductile metals me- chanically by localized plastic deformation within the outer surface region. Com-mercially, this is often accomplished by a process termed shot peening. Small, hard particles (shot) having diameters within the range of 0.1 to 1.0 mm are projectedat high velocities onto the surface to be treated. The resulting deformation inducescompressive stresses to a depth of between one-quarter and one-half of the shotdiameter. The influence of shot peening on the fatigue behavior of steel is demon-strated schematically in Figure 8.26. Case hardening is a technique by which both surface hardness and fatigue life are enhanced for steel alloys. This is accomplished by a carburizing or nitrid-ing process whereby a component is exposed to a carbonaceous or nitrogenousatmosphere at an elevated temperature. A carbon- or nitrogen-rich outer surfacelayer (or “case”) is introduced by atomic diffusion from the gaseous phase.

gaseous phase. Thecase is normally on the order of 1 mm deep and is harder than the inner core ofmaterial. (The influence of carbon content on hardness for Fe–C alloys is demon-strated in Figure 10.29 a.) The improvement of fatigue properties results from increased hardness within the case, as well as the desired residual compressivestresses the formation of which attends the carburizing or nitriding process. Acarbon-rich outer case may be observed for the gear shown in the chapter-openingphotograph for Chapter 5; it appears as a dark outer rim within the sectionedsegment. The increase in case hardness is demonstrated in the photomicrographappearing in Figure 8.27. The dark and elongated diamond shapes are Knoopmicrohardness indentations. The upper indentation, lying within the carburizedlayer, is smaller than the core indentation.236 •Chapter 8 / Failure case hardeningCycles to failure (logarithmic scale)Stress amplitudeShot peened NormalFigure 8.26 Schematic S–N fatigue curves for normal and shot-peened steel.

A few brief comments will be given relative to two types of environment-assisted fatigue fail-ure: thermal fatigue and corrosion fatigue. Thermal fatigue is normally induced at elevated temperatures by fluctuating thermal stresses; mechanical stresses from an external source need not be present.The origin of these thermal stresses is the restraint to the dimensional expansionand/or contraction that would normally occur in a structural member with varia-tions in temperature.

in temperature. The magnitude of a thermal stress developed by a tempera-ture change is dependent on the coefficient of thermal expansion and themodulus of elasticity E according to (8.18) (The topics of thermal expansion and thermal stresses are discussed in Sections 19.3and 19.5.) Of course, thermal stresses will not arise if this mechanical restraint isabsent. Therefore, one obvious way to prevent this type of fatigue is to eliminate,or at least reduce, the restraint source, thus allowing unhindered dimensionalchanges with temperature variations, or to choose materials with appropriate phys-ical properties. Failure that occurs by the simultaneous action of a cyclic stress and chemical attack is termed corrosion fatigue. Corrosive environments have a deleterious in- fluence and produce shorter fatigue lives. Even the normal ambient atmosphere willaffect the fatigue behavior of some materials. Small pits may form as a result ofchemical reactions between the environment and material, which serve as points ofstress concentration and therefore as crack nucleation sites. In addition, crack prop-agation rate is enhanced as a result of the corrosive environment. The nature of thestress cycles will influence the fatigue behavior; for example, lowering the load ap-plication frequency leads to longer periods during which the opened crack is in con-tact with the environment and to a reduction in the fatigue life. Several approaches to corrosion fatigue prevention exist. On one hand, we can take measures to reduce the rate of corrosion by some of the techniquesdiscussed in Chapter 17—for example, apply protective surface coatings, select as/H11005a lE ¢Tal ¢T8.11 Environmental Effects •237 Figure 8.27 Photomicrograph showing both core (bottom) and carburized outer case (top) regions of a case-hardened steel.

And/or it might be advisable to take actions to minimize the probabilityof normal fatigue failure, as outlined above—for example, reduce the appliedtensile stress level and impose residual compressive stresses on the surface ofthe member. Creep Materials are often placed in service at elevated temperatures and exposed to staticmechanical stresses (e.g., turbine rotors in jet engines and steam generators thatexperience centrifugal stresses, and high-pressure steam lines). Deformation undersuch circumstances is termed creep. Defined as the time-dependent and permanent deformation of materials when subjected to a constant load or stress, creep is nor-mally an undesirable phenomenon and is often the limiting factor in the lifetime ofa part. It is observed in all materials types; for metals it becomes important onlyfor temperatures greater than about ( absolute melting temperature).Amorphous polymers, which include plastics and rubbers, are especially sensitiveto creep deformation as discussed in Section 15.4. 8.12 GENERALIZED CREEP BEHAVIOR A typical creep test6consists of subjecting a specimen to a constant load or stress while maintaining the temperature constant; deformation or strain is measured andplotted as a function of elapsed time. Most tests are the constant load type, whichyield information of an engineering nature; constant stress tests are employed toprovide a better understanding of the mechanisms of creep. Figure 8.28 is a schematic representation of the typical constant load creep be- havior of metals.

of metals. Upon application of the load there is an instantaneous deforma-tion, as indicated in the figure, which is mostly elastic. The resulting creep curveconsists of three regions, each of which has its own distinctive strain–time feature.Primary ortransient creep occurs first, typified by a continuously decreasing creep rate; that is, the slope of the curve diminishes with time. This suggests that the ma-terial is experiencing an increase in creep resistance or strain hardening (Section7.10)—deformation becomes more difficult as the material is strained. For secondary creep, sometimes termed steady-state creep, the rate is constant; that is, the plot be- comes linear. This is often the stage of creep that is of the longest duration. Theconstancy of creep rate is explained on the basis of a balance between the com-peting processes of strain hardening and recovery, recovery (Section 7.11) being theprocess whereby a material becomes softer and retains its ability to experiencedeformation. Finally, for tertiary creep, there is an acceleration of the rate and ulti- mate failure. This failure is frequently termed rupture and results from microstruc- tural and/or metallurgical changes; for example, grain boundary separation, and theformation of internal cracks, cavities, and voids. Also, for tensile loads, a neck mayform at some point within the deformation region. These all lead to a decrease inthe effective cross-sectional area and an increase in strain rate.Tm/H11005 0.4Tm238 •Chapter 8 / Failure creep 6ASTM Standard E 139, “Standard Practice for Conducting Creep, Creep-Rupture, and Stress-Rupture Tests of Metallic Materials.”1496T_c08_207-251 11/18/05 11:50 Page 238REVISED PAGESFor metallic materials most creep tests are conducted in uniaxial tension using a specimen having the same geometry as for tensile tests (Figure 6.2).

(Figure 6.2). On the other hand, uniaxial compression tests are more appropriate for brittle materials; theseprovide a better measure of the intrinsic creep properties inasmuch as there is nostress amplification and crack propagation, as with tensile loads. Compressive testspecimens are usually right cylinders or parallelepipeds having length-to-diameterratios ranging from about 2 to 4. For most materials creep properties are virtuallyindependent of loading direction. Possibly the most important parameter from a creep test is the slope of the sec- ondary portion of the creep curve ( in Figure 8.28); this is often called theminimum or steady-state creep rate It is the engineering design parameter that is considered for long-life applications, such as a nuclear power plant component thatis scheduled to operate for several decades, and when failure or too much strainare not options. On the other hand, for many relatively short-life creep situations(e.g., turbine blades in military aircraft and rocket motor nozzles), time to rupture, or the rupture lifetime , is the dominant design consideration; it is also indicated in Figure 8.28. Of course, for its determination, creep tests must be conducted tothe point of failure; these are termed creep rupture tests. Thus, a knowledge of these creep characteristics of a material allows the design engineer to ascertain its suit-ability for a specific application. Concept Check 8.5 Superimpose on the same strain-versus-time plot schematic creep curves for both con-stant tensile stress and constant tensile load, and explain the differences in behavior. [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 8.13 STRESS AND TEMPERATURE EFFECTS Both temperature and the level of the applied stress influence the creep charac-teristics (Figure 8.29). At a temperature substantially below and after theinitial deformation, the strain is virtually independent of time.

of time. With either increas-ing stress or temperature, the following will be noted: (1) the instantaneous strainat the time of stress application increases, (2) the steady-state creep rate is increased,and (3) the rupture lifetime is diminished.0.4T m,tr/H9280# s.¢/H9280/H11408¢t8.13 Stress and Temperature Effects •239Creep strain, /H9280 Time, tRupture TertiaryΔt Δ/H9280Primary trSecondary Instantaneous deformationFigure 8.28 Typical creep curve of strain versus time at constant stress and constant elevated temperature.

Figure 8.30 is one such plot for a nickel alloy in which a linear relationship can be seen to exist at each tem-perature. For some alloys and over relatively large stress ranges, nonlinearity inthese curves is observed. Empirical relationships have been developed in which the steady-state creep rate as a function of stress and temperature is expressed. Its dependence on stresscan be written (8.19) where and nare material constants.

It has been possible to elucidate the creep mechanism for a particular material by com-paring its experimental n value with values predicted for the various mechanisms.

various mechanisms. In addition, correlations have been made between the activation energy for creep and the activation energy for diffusion ( Equation 5.8). Creep data of this nature are represented pictorially for some well-studied sys- tems in the form of stress–temperature diagrams, which are termed deformation mechanism maps. These maps indicate stress–temperature regimes (or areas) overwhich various mechanisms operate. Constant strain rate contours are often also in-cluded. Thus, for some creep situation, given the appropriate deformation mecha-nism map and any two of the three parameters—temperature, stress level, and creepstrain rate—the third parameter may be determined. 8.14 DATA EXTRAPOLATION METHODS The need often arises for engineering creep data that are impractical to collect fromnormal laboratory tests. This is especially true for prolonged exposures (on the orderof years).One solution to this problem involves performing creep and/or creep rupturetests at temperatures in excess of those required, for shorter time periods, and at acomparable stress level, and then making a suitable extrapolation to the in-servicecondition. A commonly used extrapolation procedure employs the Larson–Millerparameter, defined as (8.21) where Cis a constant (usually on the order of 20), for Tin Kelvin and the rupture lifetime in hours. The rupture lifetime of a given material measured at some spe-cific stress level will vary with temperature such that this parameter remains con-stant. Or, the data may be plotted as the logarithm of stress versus the Larson–Millerparameter, as shown in Figure 8.32. Utilization of this technique is demonstrated inthe following design example.t rT 1C/H11001log tr2Qd, (Qc)8.14 Data Extrapolation Methods •241 30 20 10 8 6 4 3 2 1 Stress (103 psi)200 100 20 10 8Stress (MPa) Steady-state creep rate (h–1)10–710–610–5427°C (800°F) 538°C (1000°F) 649°C (1200°F)80 60 40 30Figure 8.3 1Stress (logarithmic scale) versus steady-state creep rate (logarithmic scale) for a low carbon–nickel alloy at three temperatures.

of metals. These include melting temperature, elastic modulus, and grain size. In general, the higher the melting temperature, the greater the elastic modulus, and the larger the grainsize, the better is a material’s resistance to creep. Relative to grain size, smallergrains permit more grain-boundary sliding, which results in higher creep rates. This1496T_c08_207-251 11/18/05 11:50 Page 242REVISED PAGESeffect may be contrasted to the influence of grain size on the mechanical behavior at low temperatures [i.e., increase in both strength (Section 7.8) and toughness(Section 8.6)]. Stainless steels (Section 11.2), the refractory metals, and the superalloys (Section 11.3) are especially resilient to creep and are commonly employed in high- temperature service applications. The creep resistance of the cobalt and nickelsuperalloys is enhanced by solid-solution alloying, and also by the addition of a dis-persed phase that is virtually insoluble in the matrix. In addition, advanced processingtechniques have been utilized; one such technique is directional solidification, whichproduces either highly elongated grains or single-crystal components (Figure 8.33).Another is the controlled unidirectional solidification of alloys having speciallydesigned compositions wherein two-phase composites result. SUMMARY Fundamentals of FractureDuctile Fracture Fracture, in response to tensile loading and at relatively low temperatures, may occur by ductile and brittle modes, both of which involve the formation and propagationof cracks. For ductile fracture, evidence will exist of gross plastic deformation at thefracture surface. In tension, highly ductile metals will neck down to essentially apoint fracture; cup-and-cone mating fracture surfaces result for moderate ductility.Cracks in ductile materials are said to be stable (i.e., resist extension without anincrease in applied stress); and inasmuch as fracture is noncatastrophic, this fracturemode is almost always preferred.

always preferred. Brittle Fracture For brittle fracture, cracks are unstable, and the fracture surface is relatively flat and perpendicular to the direction of the applied tensile load. Chevron and ridge-like patterns are possible, which indicate the direction of crack propagation. Trans-granular (through-grain) and intergranular (between-grain) fractures are found inbrittle polycrystalline materials.Summary •243 Conventional casting(a) Columnar grain Single crystal(b) (c)Figure 8.33 (a) Polycrystalline turbine blade that was produced by a conventional casting technique. High-temperature creep resistance is improved as a result of an oriented columnar grain structure (b) produced by a sophisticated directional solidification technique.

(Courtesy of Pratt & Whitney. )1496T_c08_207-251 11/18/05 11:50 Page 243REVISED PAGESPrinciples of Fracture Mechanics The significant discrepancy between actual and theoretical fracture strengths of brittle materials is explained by the existence of small flaws that are capable ofamplifying an applied tensile stress in their vicinity, leading ultimately to crackformation. Fracture ensues when the theoretical cohesive strength is exceeded atthe tip of one of these flaws. The fracture toughness of a material is indicative of its resistance to brittle frac- ture when a crack is present. It depends on specimen thickness, and, for relativelythick specimens (i.e., conditions of plane strain), is termed the plane strain fracturetoughness. This parameter is the one normally cited for design purposes; its valueis relatively large for ductile materials (and small for brittle ones), and is a functionof microstructure, strain rate, and temperature. With regard to designing against thepossibility of fracture, consideration must be given to material (its fracture tough-ness), the stress level, and the flaw size detection limit.

detection limit. Impact Fracture Testing Qualitatively, the fracture behavior of materials may be determined using Charpy and Izod impact testing techniques. On the basis of the temperature dependence ofmeasured impact energy (or appearance of the fracture surface), it is possible toascertain whether or not a material experiences a ductile-to-brittle transition andthe temperature range over which such a transition occurs. Low-strength steelalloys typify this behavior, and, for structural applications, should be used attemperatures in excess of the transition range. Furthermore, low-strength FCC met-als, most HCP metals, and high-strength materials do not experience this ductile-to-brittle transition. Cyclic Stresses (Fatigue) The S–N Curve Fatigue is a common type of catastrophic failure wherein the applied stress levelfluctuates with time. Test data are plotted as stress versus the logarithm of the num-ber of cycles to failure. For many metals and alloys, stress diminishes continuouslywith increasing number of cycles at failure; fatigue strength and fatigue life are theparameters used to characterize the fatigue behavior of these materials. On theother hand, for other metals/alloys, at some point, stress ceases to decrease with,and becomes independent of, the number of cycles; the fatigue behavior of thesematerials is expressed in terms of fatigue limit. Crack Initiation and Propagation The processes of fatigue crack initiation and propagation were discussed. Cracks normally nucleate on the surface of a component at some point of stress concen-tration. Two characteristic fatigue surface features are beachmarks and striations.Beachmarks form on components that experience applied stress interruptions; theynormally may be observed with the naked eye. Fatigue striations are of microscopicdimensions, and each is thought to represent the crack tip advance distance over asingle load cycle. Factors That Affect Fatigue Life Measures that may be taken to extend fatigue life include: (1) reducing the mean stress level; (2) eliminating sharp surface discontinuities; (3) improving the surface244 •Chapter 8 / Failure 1496T_c08_207-251 11/18/05 11:50 Page 244REVISED PAGESfinish by polishing; (4) imposing surface residual compressive stresses by shot peen- ing; and (5) case hardening by using a carburizing or nitriding process.

nitriding process. Environmental Effects The fatigue behavior of materials may also be affected by the environment. Ther- mal stresses may be induced in components that are exposed to elevated tempera-ture fluctuations and when thermal expansion and/or contraction is restrained;fatigue for these conditions is termed thermal fatigue. The presence of a chemicallyactive environment may lead to a reduction in fatigue life for corrosion fatigue. Generalized Creep Behavior The time-dependent plastic deformation of materials subjected to a constant load (or stress) and temperatures greater than about is termed creep. A typicalcreep curve (strain versus time) will normally exhibit three distinct regions. For tran-sient (or primary) creep, the rate (or slope) diminishes with time. The plot becomeslinear (i.e., creep rate is constant) in the steady-state (or secondary) region. Andfinally, deformation accelerates for tertiary creep, just prior to failure (or rupture).Important design parameters available from such a plot include the steady-statecreep rate (slope of the linear region) and rupture lifetime. Stress and Temperature Effects Both temperature and applied stress level influence creep behavior. Increasing either of these parameters produces the following effects: (1) an increase in the in-stantaneous initial deformation; (2) an increase in the steady-state creep rate; and(3) a diminishment of the rupture lifetime. Analytical expressions were presentedwhich relate to both temperature and stress. Data Extrapolation Methods Extrapolation of creep test data to lower temperature—longer time regimes is pos- sible using the Larson–Miller parameter. Alloys for High-Temperature Use Metal alloys that are especially resistant to creep have high elastic moduli and melt- ing temperatures; these include the superalloys, the stainless steels, and the refractorymetals. Various processing techniques are employed to improve the creep propertiesof these materials./H9280# s0.4TmImportant Terms and Concepts •245 IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS Brittle fractureCase hardeningCharpy testCorrosion fatigueCreepDuctile fractureDuctile-to-brittle transitionFatigueFatigue lifeFatigue limitFatigue strengthFracture mechanicsFracture toughnessImpact energyIntergranular fractureIzod testPlane strainPlane strain fracture toughnessStress raiserThermal fatigueTransgranular fracture1496T_c08_207-251 11/18/05 11:50 Page 245REVISED PAGESREFERENCES246 •Chapter 8 / Failure ASM Handbook, Vol.

One reason that a knowledge and understanding of phase diagrams is important to the engineer relates tothe design and control of heat-treating procedures;some properties of materials are functions of their mi-crostructures, and, consequently, of their thermal his-tories.

thermal his-tories. Even though most phase diagrams representstable (or equilibrium) states and microstructures, theyare nevertheless useful in understanding the develop-ment and preservation of nonequilibrium structuresand their attendant properties; it is often the casethat these properties are more desirable than thoseassociated with the equilibrium state. This is aptlyillustrated by the phenomenon of precipitationhardening (Section 11.9). WHY STUDY Phase Diagrams ? 1496T_c09_252-310 12/21/05 8:30 Page 2522nd REVISE PAGES9.1 INTRODUCTION The understanding of phase diagrams for alloy systems is extremely important be- cause there is a strong correlation between microstructure and mechanical properties,and the development of microstructure of an alloy is related to the characteristics ofits phase diagram. In addition, phase diagrams provide valuable information aboutmelting, casting, crystallization, and other phenomena. This chapter presents and discusses the following topics: (1) terminology asso- ciated with phase diagrams and phase transformations; (2) pressure–temperaturephase diagrams for pure materials; (3) the interpretation of phase diagrams; (4) someof the common and relatively simple binary phase diagrams, including that for theiron–carbon system; and (5) the development of equilibrium microstructures, uponcooling, for several situations. Definitions and Basic Concepts It is necessary to establish a foundation of definitions and basic concepts relatingto alloys, phases, and equilibrium before delving into the interpretation and uti-lization of phase diagrams. The term component is frequently used in this discus- sion; components are pure metals and/or compounds of which an alloy is composed.For example, in a copper–zinc brass, the components are Cu and Zn. Solute and solvent, which are also common terms, were defined in Section 4.3. Another term used in this context is system, which has two meanings.

two meanings. First, “system” may refer to a specific body of material under consideration (e.g., a ladle of molten steel). Or itmay relate to the series of possible alloys consisting of the same components, butwithout regard to alloy composition (e.g., the iron–carbon system). The concept of a solid solution was introduced in Section 4.3. By way of review, a solid solution consists of atoms of at least two different types; the solute atomsoccupy either substitutional or interstitial positions in the solvent lattice, and thecrystal structure of the solvent is maintained.Learning Objectives After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1. (a) Schematically sketch simple isomorphous and eutectic phase diagrams. (b) On these diagrams label the various phase regions. (c) Label liquidus, solidus, and solvus lines. 2.Given a binary phase diagram, the compositionof an alloy, its temperature, and assuming thatthe alloy is at equilibrium, determine(a) what phase(s) is (are) present,(b) the composition(s) of the phase(s), and(c) the mass fraction(s) of the phase(s). 3.For some given binary phase diagram, do thefollowing:(a) locate the temperatures and compositions of all eutectic, eutectoid, peritectic, andcongruent phase transformations; and(b) write reactions for all these transformations for either heating or cooling. 4.Given the composition of an iron–carbon alloy containing between 0.022 wt% C and 2.14 wt%C, be able to(a) specify whether the alloy is hypoeutectoid or hypereutectoid, (b) name the proeutectoid phase,(c) compute the mass fractions of proeutectoid phase and pearlite, and (d) make a schematic diagram of the microstruc- ture at a temperature just below theeutectoid.

below theeutectoid. component system1496T_c09_252-310 12/21/05 7:56 Page 2532nd REVISE PAGES9.2 SOLUBILITY LIMIT For many alloy systems and at some specific temperature, there is a maximum concentration of solute atoms that may dissolve in the solvent to form a solid so-lution; this is called a solubility limit. The addition of solute in excess of this solu- bility limit results in the formation of another solid solution or compound that hasa distinctly different composition. To illustrate this concept, consider the sugar–water ( ) system. Initially, as sugar is added to water, a sugar–water solution or syrup forms. As more sugar is introduced, the solution becomes moreconcentrated, until the solubility limit is reached, or the solution becomes saturatedwith sugar. At this time the solution is not capable of dissolving any more sugar,and further additions simply settle to the bottom of the container. Thus, the systemnow consists of two separate substances: a sugar–water syrup liquid solution andsolid crystals of undissolved sugar. This solubility limit of sugar in water depends on the temperature of the water and may be represented in graphical form on a plot of temperature along the or-dinate and composition (in weight percent sugar) along the abscissa, as shown inFigure 9.1. Along the composition axis, increasing sugar concentration is from leftto right, and percentage of water is read from right to left. Since only two compo-nents are involved (sugar and water), the sum of the concentrations at any com-position will equal 100 wt%. The solubility limit is represented as the nearly verticalline in the figure. For compositions and temperatures to the left of the solubilityline, only the syrup liquid solution exists; to the right of the line, syrup and solidsugar coexist. The solubility limit at some temperature is the composition thatcorresponds to the intersection of the given temperature coordinate and the solu-bility limit line.

limit line. For example, at the maximum solubility of sugar in water is65 wt%. As Figure 9.1 indicates, the solubility limit increases slightly with risingtemperature. 9.3 PHASES Also critical to the understanding of phase diagrams is the concept of a phase. A phase may be defined as a homogeneous portion of a system that has uniform phys-ical and chemical characteristics. Every pure material is considered to be a phase;20/H11034CC 12H22O11–H2Osolubility limit phase Composition (wt%)Temperature (°C) Temperature (°F) 0 20 40 60 80 100 100Sugar Water 80 60 40 20 050100150 Liquid solution + solid sugarLiquid solution (syrup)Solubility limit200 020406080100 Figure 9.1 The solubility of sugar in a sugar–water syrup. (C12H22O11)254 •Chapter 9 / Phase Diagrams1496T_c09_252-310 11/29/05 11:33 Page 254REVISED PAGESso also is every solid, liquid, and gaseous solution. For example, the sugar–water syrup solution just discussed is one phase, and solid sugar is another. Each has dif-ferent physical properties (one is a liquid, the other is a solid); furthermore, each isdifferent chemically (i.e., has a different chemical composition); one is virtually puresugar, the other is a solution of and If more than one phase is pres-ent in a given system, each will have its own distinct properties, and a boundaryseparating the phases will exist across which there will be a discontinuous and abruptchange in physical and/or chemical characteristics. When two phases are present ina system, it is not necessary that there be a difference in both physical and chemi-cal properties; a disparity in one or the other set of properties is sufficient.

is sufficient. Whenwater and ice are present in a container, two separate phases exist; they are physi-cally dissimilar (one is a solid, the other is a liquid) but identical in chemical makeup.Also, when a substance can exist in two or more polymorphic forms (e.g., havingboth FCC and BCC structures), each of these structures is a separate phase becausetheir respective physical characteristics differ. Sometimes, a single-phase system is termed “homogeneous.” Systems composed of two or more phases are termed “mixtures” or “heterogeneous systems.” Mostmetallic alloys and, for that matter, ceramic, polymeric, and composite systems areheterogeneous. Ordinarily, the phases interact in such a way that the property com-bination of the multiphase system is different from, and more attractive than, eitherof the individual phases. 9.4 MICROSTRUCTURE Many times, the physical properties and, in particular, the mechanical behavior ofa material depend on the microstructure. Microstructure is subject to direct micro-scopic observation, using optical or electron microscopes; this topic was touched onin Sections 4.9 and 4.10. In metal alloys, microstructure is characterized by the num-ber of phases present, their proportions, and the manner in which they are distrib-uted or arranged. The microstructure of an alloy depends on such variables as thealloying elements present, their concentrations, and the heat treatment of the alloy(i.e., the temperature, the heating time at temperature, and the rate of cooling toroom temperature). The procedure of specimen preparation for microscopic examination was briefly outlined in Section 4.10.After appropriate polishing and etching, the different phasesmay be distinguished by their appearance. For example, for a two-phase alloy, onephase may appear light and the other phase dark, as in the chapter-opening photo-graph for this chapter.

this chapter. When only a single phase or solid solution is present, the tex-ture will be uniform, except for grain boundaries that may be revealed (Figure 4.12 b). 9.5 PHASE EQUILIBRIA Equilibrium is another essential concept that is best described in terms of a ther- modynamic quantity called the free energy. In brief, free energy is a function of the internal energy of a system, and also the randomness or disorder of the atoms ormolecules (or entropy). A system is at equilibrium if its free energy is at a mini-mum under some specified combination of temperature, pressure, and composition.In a macroscopic sense, this means that the characteristics of the system do notchange with time but persist indefinitely; that is, the system is stable. A change intemperature, pressure, and/or composition for a system in equilibrium will result inan increase in the free energy and in a possible spontaneous change to another statewhereby the free energy is lowered.C 12H22O11. H2O9.5 Phase Equilibria •255 equilibrium free energy1496T_c09_252-310 11/29/05 11:33 Page 255REVISED PAGESThe term phase equilibrium, often used in the context of this discussion, refers to equilibrium as it applies to systems in which more than one phase may exist. Phase equilibrium is reflected by a constancy with time in the phase characteristicsof a system. Perhaps an example best illustrates this concept. Suppose that asugar–water syrup is contained in a closed vessel and the solution is in contact withsolid sugar at . If the system is at equilibrium, the composition of the syrup is65 wt% wt% (Figure 9.1), and the amounts and compositions of the syrup and solid sugar will remain constant with time. If the temperature ofthe system is suddenly raised—say, to —this equilibrium or balance is tem-porarily upset in that the solubility limit has been increased to 80 wt% (Figure 9.1).

(Figure 9.1). Thus, some of the solid sugar will go into solution in the syrup. Thiswill continue until the new equilibrium syrup concentration is established at thehigher temperature. This sugar–syrup example illustrates the principle of phase equilibrium using a liquid–solid system. In many metallurgical and materials systems of interest, phaseequilibrium involves just solid phases. In this regard the state of the system is re-flected in the characteristics of the microstructure, which necessarily include notonly the phases present and their compositions but, in addition, the relative phaseamounts and their spatial arrangement or distribution. Free energy considerations and diagrams similar to Figure 9.1 provide infor- mation about the equilibrium characteristics of a particular system, which is im-portant; but they do not indicate the time period necessary for the attainment of anew equilibrium state. It is often the case, especially in solid systems, that a state ofequilibrium is never completely achieved because the rate of approach to equilib-rium is extremely slow; such a system is said to be in a nonequilibrium or metastable state. A metastable state or microstructure may persist indefinitely, experiencingonly extremely slight and almost imperceptible changes as time progresses. Often,metastable structures are of more practical significance than equilibrium ones. Forexample, some steel and aluminum alloys rely for their strength on the develop-ment of metastable microstructures during carefully designed heat treatments(Sections 10.5 and 11.9). Thus not only is an understanding of equilibrium states and structures impor- tant, but also the speed or rate at which they are established and the factors thataffect the rate must be considered. This chapter is devoted almost exclusively toequilibrium structures; the treatment of reaction rates and nonequilibrium struc-tures is deferred to Chapter 10 and Section 11.9.

Perhaps the simplest and easiest type of phase diagram to understand is that for a one-component system, in which composition is held constant (i.e., thephase diagram is for a pure substance); this means that pressure and temperatureare the variables. This one-component phase diagram (or unary phase diagram ) [sometimes also called a pressure–temperature (or P–T ) diagram] is repre- sented as a two-dimensional plot of pressure (ordinate, or vertical axis) versustemperature (abscissa, or horizontal axis). Most often, the pressure axis is scaledlogarithmically. We illustrate this type of phase diagram and demonstrate its interpretation us- ing as an example the one for , which is shown in Figure 9.2. Here it may benoted that regions for three different phases—solid, liquid, and vapor—are delin-eated on the plot. Each of the phases will exist under equilibrium conditions overthe temperature–pressure ranges of its corresponding area. Furthermore, the threecurves shown on the plot (labeled aO, bO, and cO) are phase boundaries; at any point on one of these curves, the two phases on either side of the curve are in equi-librium (or coexist) with one another.

one another. That is, equilibrium between solid and vaporphases is along curve aO—likewise for the solid-liquid, curve bO, and the liquid- vapor, curve cO. Also, upon crossing a boundary (as temperature and/or pressure is altered), one phase transforms to another. For example, at one atmosphere pres-sure, during heating the solid phase transforms to the liquid phase (i.e., meltingoccurs) at the point labeled 2 on Figure 9.2 (i.e., the intersection of the dashedhorizontal line with the solid-liquid phase boundary); this point corresponds to atemperature of . Of course, the reverse transformation (liquid-to-solid, or so-lidification) takes place at the same point upon cooling. Similarly, at the intersectionof the dashed line with the liquid-vapor phase boundary [point 3 (Figure 9.2), at the liquid transforms to the vapor phase (or vaporizes) upon heating; 100/H11034C]0/H11034CH 2O9.6 One-Component (or Unary) Phase Diagrams •257 Liquid (Water)Pressure (atm) Vapor (Steam)1,000 100 10 1.0 0.1 0.01 0.001/H1100220 20 40 60 80 100 120 0Solid (Ice) Oc ab Temperature (°C)2 3 Figure 9.2 Pressure–temperature phase diagram for Intersection of the dashed horizontal line at 1 atm pressure with the solid-liquid phase boundary (point 2) corresponds to themelting point at this pressure ( ).

for cooling. And, finally, solid ice sublimes or vaporizes upon crossing the curve labeled aO. As may also be noted from Figure 9.2, all three of the phase boundary curves intersect at a common point, which is labeled O(and for this system, at a tem- perature of 273.16 K and a pressure of atm). This means that at this point only, all of the solid, liquid, and vapor phases are simultaneously in equilib-rium with one another. Appropriately, this, and any other point on a P–T phase di- agram where three phases are in equilibrium, is called a triple point; sometimes it is also termed an invariant point inasmuch as its position is distinct, or fixed by def- inite values of pressure and temperature. Any deviation from this point by a changeof temperature and/or pressure will cause at least one of the phases to disappear. Pressure-temperature phase diagrams for a number of substances have been determined experimentally, which also have solid, liquid, and vapor phase regions.In those instances when multiple solid phases (i.e., allotropes, Section 3.6) exist,there will appear a region on the diagram for each solid phase, and also othertriple points. The pressure-temperature phase diagram for carbon (which includesphase regions for diamond and graphite) is shown on the front and back coversof this book. Binary Phase Diagrams Another type of extremely common phase diagram is one in which temperatureand composition are variable parameters, and pressure is held constant—normally1 atm. There are several different varieties; in the present discussion, we will con-cern ourselves with binary alloys—those that contain two components. If more thantwo components are present, phase diagrams become extremely complicated anddifficult to represent. An explanation of the principles governing and the interpre-tation of phase diagrams can be demonstrated using binary alloys even though mostalloys contain more than two components.

two components. Binary phase diagrams are maps that represent the relationships between tem- perature and the compositions and quantities of phases at equilibrium, which in-fluence the microstructure of an alloy. Many microstructures develop from phasetransformations, the changes that occur when the temperature is altered (ordinar-ily upon cooling). This may involve the transition from one phase to another, or theappearance or disappearance of a phase. Binary phase diagrams are helpful in pre-dicting phase transformations and the resulting microstructures, which may haveequilibrium or nonequilibrium character. 9.7 BINARY ISOMORPHOUS SYSTEMS Possibly the easiest type of binary phase diagram to understand and interpret is thetype that is characterized by the copper–nickel system (Figure 9.3 a). Temperature is plotted along the ordinate, and the abscissa represents the composition of the al-loy, in weight percent (bottom) and atom percent (top) of nickel. The compositionranges from 0 wt% Ni (100 wt% Cu) on the left horizontal extremity to 100 wt%Ni (0 wt% Cu) on the right. Three different phase regions, or fields, appear on thediagram, an alpha ( ) field, a liquid ( L) field, and a two-phase field. Each region is defined by the phase or phases that exist over the range of temperaturesand compositions delimited by the phase boundary lines. The liquid Lis a homogeneous liquid solution composed of both copper and nickel. The phase is a substitutional solid solution consisting of both Cu and Ni atoms, andaa/H11001L a6.04 /H1100310 /H110023H2O258 •Chapter 9 / Phase Diagrams1496T_c09_252-310 11/29/05 12:46 Page 258REVISED PAGEShaving an FCC crystal structure.

Thiscomplete solubility is explained by the fact that both Cu and Ni have the same crys-tal structure (FCC), nearly identical atomic radii and electronegativities, and similarvalences, as discussed in Section 4.3. The copper–nickel system is termed isomorphous because of this complete liquid and solid solubility of the two components.1080/H11034C,9.7 Binary Isomorphous Systems •259 B1453°C Liquid Liquidus lineSolidus line A 1085°C1600 1500 1400 13001200 1100 10000 2 04 06 08 0 1 0 0Composition (at% Ni)Temperature (°C)2800 2600 2400 2200 2000 Temperature (°F) 100 80 60 40 20 0 (Ni) (Cu) (a)Composition (wt% Ni)+ L/H9251 /H9251 BTemperature (°C)1300 1200 30 (b)Composition (wt% Ni)CL C0C/H9251+ Liquid/H9251+ Liquid/H9251 /H9251 /H9251Liquid Tie line 20 40 50R S isomorphousFigure 9.3 (a) The copper–nickel phase diagram.

First, for metallic alloys, solid solutions are commonly designated by lowercase Greek letters ( etc.). Furthermore, with regard to phase boundaries, the line separating the Land phase fields is termed the liquidus line, as indicated in Figure 9.3 a; the liq- uid phase is present at all temperatures and compositions above this line.The solidus lineis located between the and regions, below which only the solid phase exists.

phase exists. For Figure 9.3a, the solidus and liquidus lines intersect at the two composition extremities; these correspond to the melting temperatures of the pure components.For example, the melting temperatures of pure copper and nickel are and respectively. Heating pure copper corresponds to moving vertically up the left-hand temperature axis. Copper remains solid until its melting temperature isreached. The solid-to-liquid transformation takes place at the melting temperature,and no further heating is possible until this transformation has been completed. For any composition other than pure components, this melting phenomenon will occur over the range of temperatures between the solidus and liquidus lines; bothsolid and liquid phases will be in equilibrium within this temperature range. Forexample, upon heating an alloy of composition 50 wt% Ni–50 wt% Cu (Figure 9.3 a), melting begins at approximately ( ); the amount of liquid phase con-tinuously increases with temperature until about ( ), at which the alloyis completely liquid. 9.8 INTERPRETATION OF PHASE DIAGRAMS For a binary system of known composition and temperature that is at equilibrium,at least three kinds of information are available: (1) the phases that are present, (2)the compositions of these phases, and (3) the percentages or fractions of the phases.The procedures for making these determinations will be demonstrated using thecopper–nickel system. Phases Present The establishment of what phases are present is relatively simple. One just locatesthe temperature–composition point on the diagram and notes the phase(s) withwhich the corresponding phase field is labeled. For example, an alloy of composi-tion 60 wt% Ni–40 wt% Cu at would be located at point Ain Figure 9.3a; since this is within the region, only the single phase will be present. On theother hand, a 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu alloy at (point B) will consist of both and liquid phases at equilibrium.

at equilibrium. Determination of Phase Compositions The first step in the determination of phase compositions (in terms of the concen-trations of the components) is to locate the temperature–composition point on thephase diagram. Different methods are used for single- and two-phase regions. Ifonly one phase is present, the procedure is trivial: the composition of this phaseis simply the same as the overall composition of the alloy. For example, considerthe 60 wt% Ni–40 wt% Cu alloy at (point A, Figure 9.3a). At this compo- sition and temperature, only the phase is present, having a composition of 60 wt%Ni–40 wt% Cu. For an alloy having composition and temperature located in a two-phase re- gion, the situation is more complicated. In all two-phase regions (and in two-phaseregions only), one may imagine a series of horizontal lines, one at every tempera-ture; each of these is known as a tie line, or sometimes as an isotherm. These tiea1100/H11034Ca1250/H11034Ca a1100/H11034C2410/H11034F 1320/H11034C2340/H11034F 1280/H11034Ca1453/H11034C,1085/H11034Ca a/H11001L aa/H11001La, b, g,260 •Chapter 9 / Phase Diagrams tie lineBi-Sb Ge-Si Bi-Sb Ge-Si1496T_c09_252-310 11/29/05 11:33 Page 260REVISED PAGESlines extend across the two-phase region and terminate at the phase boundary lines on either side. To compute the equilibrium concentrations of the two phases, thefollowing procedure is used: 1.A tie line is constructed across the two-phase region at the temperature ofthe alloy.

ofthe alloy. 2.The intersections of the tie line and the phase boundaries on either side arenoted. 3.Perpendiculars are dropped from these intersections to the horizontal composi-tion axis, from which the composition of each of the respective phases is read. For example, consider again the 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu alloy at located at point B in Figure 9.3b and lying within the region. Thus, the problem is to determine the composition (in wt% Ni and Cu) for both the and liquid phases. The tie line has been constructed across the phase region, as shown in Figure 9.3 b. The perpendicular from the intersection of the tie line with the liquidus boundarymeets the composition axis at 31.5 wt% Ni–68.5 wt% Cu, which is the compositionof the liquid phase, . Likewise, for the solidus–tie line intersection, we find a com-position for the solid-solution phase, , of 42.5 wt% Ni–57.5 wt% Cu. Determination of Phase Amounts The relative amounts (as fraction or as percentage) of the phases present at equi-librium may also be computed with the aid of phase diagrams. Again, the single- andtwo-phase situations must be treated separately.The solution is obvious in the single-phase region: Since only one phase is present, the alloy is composed entirely of thatphase; that is, the phase fraction is 1.0 or, alternatively, the percentage is 100%. Fromthe previous example for the 60 wt% Ni–40 wt% Cu alloy at (point Ain Figure 9.3a), only the phase is present; hence, the alloy is completely or 100% If the composition and temperature position is located within a two-phase region, things are more complex. The tie line must be utilized in conjunction with a pro-cedure that is often called the lever rule (or the inverse lever rule), which is applied as follows: 1.The tie line is constructed across the two-phase region at the temperature ofthe alloy.

ofthe alloy. 2.The overall alloy composition is located on the tie line. 3.The fraction of one phase is computed by taking the length of tie line fromthe overall alloy composition to the phase boundary for the other phase, and dividing by the total tie line length. 4.The fraction of the other phase is determined in the same manner. 5.If phase percentages are desired, each phase fraction is multiplied by 100.When the composition axis is scaled in weight percent, the phase fractionscomputed using the lever rule are mass fractions—the mass (or weight) of aspecific phase divided by the total alloy mass (or weight). The mass of eachphase is computed from the product of each phase fraction and the totalalloy mass. In the employment of the lever rule, tie line segment lengths may be deter- mined either by direct measurement from the phase diagram using a linear scale, preferably graduated in millimeters, or by subtracting compositions as taken fromthe composition axis.a. a1100/H11034CC a aCLa/H11001Laa/H11001L1250/H11034C,9.8 Interpretation of Phase Diagrams •261 lever ruleBi-Sb Ge-Si1496T_c09_252-310 11/29/05 11:33 Page 261REVISED PAGESConsider again the example shown in Figure 9.3 b, in which at both and liquid phases are present for a 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu alloy. The problem is to compute the fraction of each of the and liquid phases. The tie line has been con-structed that was used for the determination of and L phase compositions. Let the overall alloy composition be located along the tie line and denoted as andmass fractions be represented by and for the respective phases. From thelever rule, may be computed according to (9.1a) or, by subtracting compositions, (9.1b) Composition need be specified in terms of only one of the constituents for a binaryalloy; for the computation above, weight percent nickel will be used (i.e.,wt% Ni, wt% Ni, and wt% Ni), and Similarly, for the phase, (9.2a) (9.2b) Of course, identical answers are obtained if compositions are expressed in weight percent copper instead of nickel.

of nickel. Thus, the lever rule may be employed to determine the relative amounts or fractions of phases in any two-phase region for a binary alloy if the temperatureand composition are known and if equilibrium has been established. Its derivationis presented as an example problem. It is easy to confuse the foregoing procedures for the determination of phase compositions and fractional phase amounts; thus, a brief summary is warranted. Com- positions of phases are expressed in terms of weight percents of the components (e.g., wt% Cu, wt% Ni). For any alloy consisting of a single phase, the composition ofthat phase is the same as the total alloy composition. If two phases are present, thetie line must be employed, the extremities of which determine the compositions ofthe respective phases. With regard to fractional phase amounts (e.g., mass fraction of the or liquid phase), when a single phase exists, the alloy is completely thatphase. For a two-phase alloy, on the other hand, the lever rule is utilized, in whicha ratio of tie line segment lengths is taken.a /H1100535/H1100231.5 42.5 /H1100231.5/H110050.32 /H11005C0/H11002CL Ca/H11002CL Wa/H11005R R/H11001SaWL/H1100542.5 /H1100235 42.5 /H1100231.5/H110050.68CL/H1100531.5 Ca/H1100542.5C0/H1100535WL/H11005Ca/H11002C0 Ca/H11002CLWL/H11005S R/H11001SWLWa WLC0,aaa 1250/H11034C262 •Chapter 9 / Phase Diagrams Lever rule expression forcomputation ofliquid mass fraction(per Figure 9.3b) Lever rule expression forcomputation of -phase mass fraction (per Figure 9.3b)a1496T_c09_252-310 11/29/05 11:33 Page 262REVISED PAGESConcept Check 9.2 A copper–nickel alloy of composition 70 wt% Ni–30 wt% Cu is slowly heated from a temperature of ( ).

Solution Consider the phase diagram for copper and nickel (Figure 9.3 b) and alloy of composition at and let and represent the same pa- rameters as above. This derivation is accomplished through two conservation- of-mass expressions. With the first, since only two phases are present, the sumof their mass fractions must be equal to unity; that is, (9.3) For the second, the mass of one of the components (either Cu or Ni) that ispresent in both of the phases must be equal to the mass of that component inthe total alloy, or (9.4) Simultaneous solution of these two equations leads to the lever rule ex- pressions for this particular situation, Equations 9.1b and 9.2b: (9.1b) (9.2b) W a/H11005C0/H11002CL Ca/H11002CL WL/H11005Ca/H11002C0 Ca/H11002CLWaCa/H11001WLCL/H11005C0Wa/H11001WL/H110051WL Ca, CL, Wa, 1250/H11034C, C0a2370/H11034F 1300/H11034C9.8 Interpretation of Phase Diagrams •2631496T_c09_252-310 11/29/05 11:33 Page 263REVISED PAGESFor multiphase alloys, it is often more convenient to specify relative phase amount in terms of volume fraction rather than mass fraction.

mass fraction. Phase volume fractions are preferred because they (rather than mass fractions) may be deter-mined from examination of the microstructure; furthermore, the properties of amultiphase alloy may be estimated on the basis of volume fractions. For an alloy consisting of and phases, the volume fraction of the phase, is defined as (9.5) where and denote the volumes of the respective phases in the alloy. Of course,an analogous expression exists for and, for an alloy consisting of just two phases,it is the case that On occasion conversion from mass fraction to volume fraction (or vice versa) is desired. Equations that facilitate these conversions are as follows: (9.6a) (9.6b) and (9.7a) (9.7b) In these expressions, and are the densities of the respective phases; these maybe determined approximately using Equations 4.10a and 4.10b. When the densities of the phases in a two-phase alloy differ significantly, there will be quite a disparity between mass and volume fractions; conversely, if the phasedensities are the same, mass and volume fractions are identical. 9.9 DEVELOPMENT OF MICROSTRUCTURE IN ISOMORPHOUS ALLOYS Equilibrium Cooling At this point it is instructive to examine the development of microstructure thatoccurs for isomorphous alloys during solidification. We first treat the situation inwhich the cooling occurs very slowly, in that phase equilibrium is continuouslymaintained.r b ra Wb/H11005Vbrb Vara/H11001Vbrb Wa/H11005Vara Vara/H11001Vbrb Vb/H11005Wb rb Wa ra/H11001Wb rb Va/H11005Wa ra Wa ra/H11001Wb rbVa/H11001Vb/H110051.Vb,vb vaVa/H11005va va/H11001vbVa,a b a264 •Chapter 9 / Phase Diagrams phase volume fraction— dependence onvolumes of and phasesb aa Conversion of mass fractions of and phases to volumefractionsb a Conversion ofvolume fractions of and phases to mass fractionsb a1496T_c09_252-310 11/29/05 12:46 Page 264REVISED PAGESLet us consider the copper–nickel system (Figure 9.3 a), specifically an alloy of composition 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu as it is cooled from .

from . The region of the Cu–Ni phase diagram in the vicinity of this composition is shown in Figure 9.4.Cooling of an alloy of the above composition corresponds to moving down thevertical dashed line. At point a, the alloy is completely liquid (of compo- sition 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu) and has the microstructure represented by the cir-cle inset in the figure. As cooling begins, no microstructural or compositionalchanges will be realized until we reach the liquidus line (point b , ).At this point, the first solid begins to form, which has a composition dictated by the tieline drawn at this temperature [i.e., 46 wt% Ni–54 wt% Cu, noted as (46 Ni)];the composition of liquid is still approximately 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu [ L(35 Ni)], which is different from that of the solid . With continued cooling, both compo-sitions and relative amounts of each of the phases will change. The compositionsof the liquid and phases will follow the liquidus and solidus lines, respectively.Furthermore, the fraction of the phase will increase with continued cooling.Note that the overall alloy composition (35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu) remains un-changed during cooling even though there is a redistribution of copper and nickelbetween the phases. At point cin Figure 9.4, the compositions of the liquid and phases are 32 wt% Ni–68 wt% Cu [ L(32 Ni)] and 43 wt% Ni–57 wt% Cu [ (43 Ni)], respectively.aa 1250/H11034C,aaaaa/H110111260/H11034C1300/H11034C,1300/H11034C9.9 Development of Microstructure in Isomorphous Alloys •265 L (35 Ni) 1300 1200 1100 50 40 30 20 Composition (wt% Ni)Temperature (°C)a b c d eL L (32 Ni)L (35 Ni) L (32 Ni) (35 Ni)L (24 Ni)L (24 Ni)/H9251 /H9251 /H9251/H9251/H9251/H9251/H9251 /H9251 /H9251 /H9251/H9251/H9251/H9251 /H9251/H9251 /H9251/H9251/H9251 /H9251/H9251 /H9251 /H9251/H9251(46 Ni) /H9251(46 Ni) /H9251(43 Ni) /H9251(43 Ni) /H9251(35 Ni)/H9251+ LFigure 9.4 Schematic representation of the development of microstructure during the equilibrium solidification of a 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu alloy.

Cu alloy. Bi-Sb Ge-Si1496T_c09_252-310 11/29/05 11:33 Page 265REVISED PAGESThe solidification process is virtually complete at about point d ; the composition of the solid is approximately 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu (the overall alloy composition) while that of the last remaining liquid is 24 wt% Ni–76 wt%Cu. Upon crossing the solidus line, this remaining liquid solidifies; the final prod-uct then is a polycrystalline -phase solid solution that has a uniform 35 wt% Ni–65wt% Cu composition (point e, Figure 9.4). Subsequent cooling will produce no microstructural or compositional alterations. Nonequilibrium Cooling Conditions of equilibrium solidification and the development of microstructures,as described in the previous section, are realized only for extremely slow coolingrates. The reason for this is that with changes in temperature, there must be read-justments in the compositions of the liquid and solid phases in accordance withthe phase diagram (i.e., with the liquidus and solidus lines), as discussed. Thesereadjustments are accomplished by diffusional processes—that is, diffusion in bothsolid and liquid phases and also across the solid–liquid interface. Inasmuch as dif-fusion is a time-dependent phenomenon (Section 5.3), to maintain equilibriumduring cooling, sufficient time must be allowed at each temperature for the ap-propriate compositional readjustments. Diffusion rates (i.e., the magnitudes of thediffusion coefficients) are especially low for the solid phase and, for both phases,decrease with diminishing temperature. In virtually all practical solidification sit-uations, cooling rates are much too rapid to allow these compositional readjust-ments and maintenance of equilibrium; consequently, microstructures other thanthose previously described develop. Some of the consequences of nonequilibrium solidification for isomorphous al- loys will now be discussed by considering a 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu alloy, the samecomposition that was used for equilibrium cooling in the previous section.

previous section. The por-tion of the phase diagram near this composition is shown in Figure 9.5; in addition,microstructures and associated phase compositions at various temperatures uponcooling are noted in the circular insets. To simplify this discussion it will be assumedthat diffusion rates in the liquid phase are sufficiently rapid such that equilibriumis maintained in the liquid. Let us begin cooling from a temperature of about ; this is indicated by point in the liquid region. This liquid has a composition of 35 wt% Ni–65 wt%Cu [noted as L(35 Ni) in the figure], and no changes occur while cooling throughthe liquid phase region (moving down vertically from point ). At point (ap-proximately ), -phase particles begin to form, which, from the tie line con-structed, have a composition of 46 wt% Ni–54 wt% Cu [ (46 Ni)]. Upon further cooling to point (about ), the liquid composition has shifted to 29 wt% Ni–71 wt% Cu; furthermore, at this temperature the composi-tion of the phase that solidified is 40 wt% Ni–60 wt% Cu [ (40 Ni)]. However,since diffusion in the solid phase is relatively slow, the phase that formed atpoint b/H11032has not changed composition appreciably—that is, it is still about 46 wt% Ni—and the composition of the grains has continuously changed with radial po-sition, from 46 wt% Ni at grain centers to 40 wt% Ni at the outer grain perime-ters.Thus, at point the average composition of the solid grains that have formed would be some volume weighted average composition, lying between 46 and40 wt% Ni. For the sake of argument, let us take this average composition to be42 wt% Ni–58 wt% Cu [ (42 Ni)]. Furthermore, we would also find that, on thebasis of lever-rule computations, a greater proportion of liquid is present for theseaa c¿,aa aa a1240/H11034C c¿aa 1260/H11034Cb¿ a¿a¿1300/H11034Caa1220/H11034C,266 •Chapter 9 / Phase Diagrams 1496T_c09_252-310 11/29/05 11:33 Page 266REVISED PAGESnonequilibrium conditions than for equilibrium cooling.

equilibrium cooling. The implication of this nonequilibrium solidification phenomenon is that the solidus line on the phasediagram has been shifted to higher Ni contents—to the average compositions ofthe phase (e.g., 42 wt% Ni at )—and is represented by the dashed line inFigure 9.5. There is no comparable alteration of the liquidus line inasmuch as it isassumed that equilibrium is maintained in the liquid phase during cooling becauseof sufficiently rapid diffusion rates. At point ( ) and for equilibrium cooling rates, solidification should be completed. However, for this nonequilibrium situation, there is still an appre-ciable proportion of liquid remaining, and the phase that is forming has a com-position of 35 wt% Ni [ (35 Ni)]; also the average -phase composition at this point is 38 wt% Ni [ (38 Ni)]. Nonequilibrium solidification finally reaches completion at point ( ). The composition of the last phase to solidify at this point is about 31 wt% Ni; theaverage composition of the phase at complete solidification is 35 wt% Ni. The inset at point shows the microstructure of the totally solid material. The degree of displacement of the nonequilibrium solidus curve from the equi- librium one will depend on rate of cooling.

is lower. Furthermore, if the diffusion rate in the solid phaseis increased, this displacement will be diminished. There are some important consequences for isomorphous alloys that have so- lidified under nonequilibrium conditions. As discussed above, the distribution ofthe two elements within the grains is nonuniform, a phenomenon termed segrega-tion; that is, concentration gradients are established across the grains that are rep- resented by the insets of Figure 9.5. The center of each grain, which is the firstpart to freeze, is rich in the high-melting element (e.g., nickel for this Cu–Ni sys-tem), whereas the concentration of the low-melting element increases with posi-tion from this region to the grain boundary. This is termed a cored structure, which gives rise to less than the optimal properties. As a casting having a cored struc-ture is reheated, grain boundary regions will melt first inasmuch as they are richerin the low-melting component.This produces a sudden loss in mechanical integritydue to the thin liquid film that separates the grains. Furthermore, this melting maybegin at a temperature below the equilibrium solidus temperature of the alloy.Coring may be eliminated by a homogenization heat treatment carried out at atemperature below the solidus point for the particular alloy composition. Duringthis process, atomic diffusion occurs, which produces compositionally homoge-neous grains. 9.10 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF ISOMORPHOUS ALLOYS We shall now briefly explore how the mechanical properties of solid isomorphousalloys are affected by composition as other structural variables (e.g., grain size) areheld constant. For all temperatures and compositions below the melting tempera-ture of the lowest-melting component, only a single solid phase will exist. There-fore, each component will experience solid-solution strengthening (Section 7.9), oran increase in strength and hardness by additions of the other component.

A number of features of this phase diagram are importantand worth noting. First, three single-phase regions are found on the diagram:and liquid. The phase is a solid solution rich in copper; it has silver as the solutecomponent and an FCC crystal structure. The /H9252-phase solid solution also has an FCC structure, but copper is the solute. Pure copper and pure silver are also con-sidered to be and phases, respectively.

Thus, the solubility in each of these solid phases is limited, in that at any tem- perature below line BEG only a limited concentration of silver will dissolve in copper (for the phase), and similarly for copper in silver (for the phase).

At temper- atures below ( ), the solid solubility limit line separating the and phase regions is termed a solvus line; the boundary AB between the and fields is the solidus line, as indicated in Figure 9.7.

Figure 9.7. For the phase, both solvus and solidus lines also exist, HG and GF, respectively, as shown. The maxi- mum solubility of copper in the phase, point G (8.8 wt% Cu), also occurs at ( ). This horizontal line BEG, which is parallel to the composition axis and extends between these maximum solubility positions, may also be considered a solidus line; it represents the lowest temperature at which a liquid phase may existfor any copper–silver alloy that is at equilibrium. There are also three two-phase regions found for the copper–silver system (Fig- ure 9.7): and . The - and -phase solid solutions coexist for all compositions and temperatures within the phase field; the and phases also coexist in their respective phase regions. Furthermore, com- positions and relative amounts for the phases may be determined using tie linesand the lever rule as outlined previously. As silver is added to copper, the temperature at which the alloys become to- tally liquid decreases along the liquidus line, line AE; thus, the melting tempera- ture of copper is lowered by silver additions. The same may be said for silver: theintroduction of copper reduces the temperature of complete melting along the otherliquidus line, FE. These liquidus lines meet at the point Eon the phase diagram, through which also passes the horizontal isotherm line BEG. Point Eis called an invariant point, which is designated by the composition and temperature for the copper–silver system, the values of and are 71.9 wt% Ag and , respectively. An important reaction occurs for an alloy of composition as it changes tem- perature in passing through this reaction may be written as follows: (9.8) Or, upon cooling, a liquid phase is transformed into the two solid and phasesat the temperature the opposite reaction occurs upon heating. This is called aeutectic reaction (eutectic means easily melted), and and represent the eu- tectic composition and temperature, respectively; and are the respectivecompositions of the and phases at Thus, for the copper–silver system, theeutectic reaction, Equation 9.8, may be written as follows: Often, the horizontal solidus line at is called the eutectic isotherm.

eutectic isotherm. The eutectic reaction, upon cooling, is similar to solidification for pure compo- nents in that the reaction proceeds to completion at a constant temperature, or isothermally, at . However, the solid product of eutectic solidification is alwaystwo solid phases, whereas for a pure component only a single phase forms. Becauseof this eutectic reaction, phase diagrams similar to that in Figure 9.7 are termedeutectic phase diagrams; components exhibiting this behavior comprise a eutecticsystem.T ETEL171.9 wt% Ag 2Δcooling heatinga18.0 wt%Ag 2/H11001b191.2 wt% Ag 2TE. b aCbE CaETE CETE;b aL1CE2Δcooling heatinga 1CaE2/H11001b1CbE 2TE;CE(1434/H11034F)779/H11034C TE CETE; CEb/H11001liquida/H11001liquid a/H11001bb a a/H11001b b/H11001L, a/H11001L,1434/H11034F779/H11034C bb a/H11001La a/H11001ba 1434/H11034F 779/H11034C1985/H11034F 1085/H11034C1434/H11034F 779/H11034C270 •Chapter 9 / Phase Diagrams liquidus line invariant point The eutectic reaction (per Figure 9.7) eutectic reactionsolvus line solidus line1496T_c09_252-310 11/29/05 11:33 Page 270REVISED PAGESIn the construction of binary phase diagrams, it is important to understand that one or at most two phases may be in equilibrium within a phase field.

phase field. This holds true for the phase diagrams in Figures 9.3 aand 9.7. For a eutectic system, three phases ( and L) may be in equilibrium, but only at points along the eutecticisotherm. Another general rule is that single-phase regions are always separatedfrom each other by a two-phase region that consists of the two single phases thatit separates. For example, the field is situated between the and single-phase regions in Figure 9.7. Another common eutectic system is that for lead and tin; the phase diagram (Figure 9.8) has a general shape similar to that for copper–silver. For the lead–tinsystem the solid solution phases are also designated by and ; in this case, rep-resents a solid solution of tin in lead and, for tin is the solvent and lead is thesolute. The eutectic invariant point is located at 61.9 wt% Sn and ( ). Ofcourse, maximum solid solubility compositions as well as component melting tem-peratures will be different for the copper–silver and lead–tin systems, as may beobserved by comparing their phase diagrams. On occasion, low-melting-temperature alloys are prepared having near-eutectic compositions. A familiar example is the 60–40 solder, containing 60 wt% Sn and40 wt% Pb. Figure 9.8 indicates that an alloy of this composition is completelymolten at about ( ), which makes this material especially attractive as alow-temperature solder, since it is easily melted.365/H11034F 185/H11034C361/H11034F 183/H11034Cb,a b ab a a/H11001ba, b,9.11 Binary Eutectic Systems •271 (Sn) (Pb) Composition (wt% Sn)Composition (at% Sn) Temperature (°F)Temperature (°C)0 100 100 80 60 40 20 0500 400300 200 100600 300 200 10020 40 60 80 /H9251/H9252+/H9252/H9251Liquid 183°C 18.3 61.9 97.8+ L/H9252+ L/H9251327°C 232°C 0 Figure 9.8 The lead–tin phase diagram.

metal alloys). They are used extensively in theelectronics industry to physically hold assembliestogether; furthermore, they must allow expansionand contraction of the various components, musttransmit electrical signals, and also dissipate anyheat that is generated. The bonding action is ac-complished by melting the solder material, allow-ing it to flow among and make contact with thecomponents to be joined (which do not melt),and, finally, upon solidification, forming a physicalbond with all of these components. In the past, the vast majority of solders have been lead-tin alloys. These materials are reliable,inexpensive, and have relatively low melting tem-peratures. The most common lead–tin solder has acomposition of 63 wt% Sn–37 wt% Pb. Accordingto the lead–tin phase diagram, Figure 9.8, this com-position is near the eutectic and has melting tem-perature of about the lowest temperaturepossible with the existence of a liquid phase (atequilibrium) for the lead–tin system. It follows thatthis alloy is often called a “eutectic lead-tin solder.” Unfortunately, lead is a mildly toxic metal, and there is serious concern about the environmentalimpact of discarded lead-containing products thatcan leach into groundwater from landfills or pol-lute the air if incinerated. Consequently, in somecountries legislation has been enacted that bansthe use of lead-containing solders. This has forcedthe development of lead-free solders that, amongother things, must have relatively low melting tem-peratures (or temperature ranges). Some of theseare ternary alloys (i.e., composed of three metals),to include tin–silver–copper and tin–silver–bismuth solders. The compositions of several lead-freesolders are listed in Table 9.1. Of course, melting temperatures (or temper- ature ranges) are important in the developmentand selection of these new solder alloys, informa-tion that is available from phase diagrams.

These possibili-ties will be considered in terms of the lead–tin phase diagram, Figure 9.8. The first case is for compositions ranging between a pure component and the maximum solid solubility for that component at room temperature [ ( )].For the lead–tin system, this includes lead-rich alloys containing between 0 andabout 2 wt% Sn (for the phase solid solution), and also between approximately99 wt% Sn and pure tin (for the phase). For example, consider an alloy of com-position C 1(Figure 9.11) as it is slowly cooled from a temperature within the liq- uid-phase region, say, ; this corresponds to moving down the dashed verticalline in the figure.

the figure. The alloy remains totally liquid and of composition until we cross the liquidus line at approximately , at which time the solid phase begins to form. While passing through this narrow phase re gion, solidifica- tion proceeds in the same manner as was described for the cop per–nickel alloy in the preceding section; that is, with continued cooling more of the solid forms. Fur-thermore, liquid- and solid-phase compositions are different, which follow along theliquidus and solidus phase boundaries, respectively. Solidification reaches comple-tion at the point where crosses the solidus line. The resulting alloy is poly-crystalline with a uniform composition of and no subsequent changes will occur C 1,ww¿aa/H11001La 330/H11034CC1 ww¿350/H11034Cba70/H11034F 20/H11034C1496T_c09_252-310 11/29/05 11:33 Page 276REVISED PAGESupon cooling to room temperature.This microstructure is represented schematically by the inset at point c in Figure 9.11. The second case considered is for compositions that range between the room temperature solubility limit and the maximum solid solubility at the eutectic tem-perature. For the lead–tin system (Figure 9.8), these compositions extend from about2 wt% Sn to 18.3 wt% Sn (for lead-rich alloys) and from 97.8 wt% Sn to approxi-mately 99 wt% Sn (for tin-rich alloys). Let us examine an alloy of composition as it is cooled along the vertical line in Figure 9.12. Down to the intersection of and the solvus line, changes that occur are similar to the previous case, as we pass through the corresponding phase regions (as demonstrated by the insets atpoints d,e, and f).

and f). Just above the solvus intersection, point f, the microstructure consists of grains of composition Upon crossing the solvus line, the solidsolubility is exceeded, which results in the formation of small -phase particles;these are indicated in the microstructure inset at point g. With continued cooling, these particles will grow in size because the mass fraction of the phase increasesslightly with decreasing temperature. The third case involves solidification of the eutectic composition, 61.9 wt% Sn ( in Figure 9.13). Consider an alloy having this composition that is cooled froma temperature within the liquid-phase region (e.g., ) down the vertical line yy¿ 250/H11034CC 3bba C2. axx¿xx¿C29.12 Development of Microstructure in Eutectic Alloys •277 /H9251+ L L L /H9251/H9252+/H9252/H9251 /H9251/H9251/H9251/H9251 /H9251 /H9251 Composition (wt% Sn)Temperature (°C)300 200 100gfedx C2L (C2 wt% Sn) C2 wt% Sn 0 1 02 03 04 05 0x/H11032Solvus lineFigure 9.12 Schematic representations of the equilibrium microstructuresfor a lead–tin alloy ofcomposition as it is cooledfrom the liquid-phase region.C 21496T_c09_252-310 11/29/05 15:20 Page 277REVISED PAGESin Figure 9.13. As the temperature is lowered, no changes occur until we reach the eutectic temperature, . Upon crossing the eutectic isotherm, the liquid trans-forms to the two and phases. This transformation may be represented by thereaction (9.9) in which the - and -phase compositions are dictated by the eutectic isotherm endpoints.

isotherm endpoints. During this transformation, there must necessarily be a redistribution of the lead and tin components, inasmuch as the and phases have different composi-tions neither of which is the same as that of the liquid (as indicated in Equation 9.9). This redistribution is accomplished by atomic diffusion. The microstructure of thesolid that results from this transformation consists of alternating layers (sometimescalled lamellae) of the and phases that form simultaneously during the trans-formation. This microstructure, represented schematically in Figure 9.13, point i,i s called a eutectic structure and is characteristic of this reaction. A photomicrograph of this structure for the lead–tin eutectic is shown in Figure 9.14. Subsequent cool-ing of the alloy from just below the eutectic to room temperature will result in onlyminor microstructural alterations. The microstructural change that accompanies this eutectic transformation is represented schematically in Figure 9.15; here is shown the layered eutecticgrowing into and replacing the liquid phase. The process of the redistribution oflead and tin occurs by diffusion in the liquid just ahead of the eutectic–liquid in-terface. The arrows indicate the directions of diffusion of lead and tin atoms; leadatoms diffuse toward the -phase layers since this phase is lead-rich (18.3 wt% –81.7 wt% Pb); conversely, the direction of diffusion of tin is in the direction of the tin-rich (97.8 wt% –2.2 wt% Pb) layers.

Con-sider, for example, the composition Figure 9.16, which lies to the left of theeutectic; as the temperature is lowered, we move down the line beginning atpoint j. The microstructural development between points jand lis similar to that for the second case, such that just prior to crossing the eutectic isotherm (point l), the and liquid phases are present having compositions of approximately 18.3 and61.9 wt% respectively, as determined from the appropriate tie line. As the tem-perature is lowered to just below the eutectic, the liquid phase, which is of the eu-tectic composition, will transform to the eutectic structure (i.e., alternating and lamellae); insignificant changes will occur with the phase that formed during cool-ing through the region. This microstructure is represented schematically bythe inset at point m in Figure 9.16. Thus, the phase will be present both in the eu- tectic structure and also as the phase that formed while cooling through the phase field. To distinguish one from the other, that which resides in the eutecticstructure is called eutectic while the other that formed prior to crossing the eutectic isotherm is termed primary both are labeled in Figure 9.16.

Since the eutectic microconstituent always forms from the liquid having the eutectic composition, this microconstituent may be assumed to have acomposition of 61.9 wt% Hence, the lever rule is applied using a tie line be-tween the phase boundary (18.3 wt% ) and the eutectic composition.For example, consider the alloy of composition in Figure 9.18. The fraction ofthe eutectic microconstituent is just the same as the fraction of liquid fromwhich it transforms, or (9.10) Furthermore, the fraction of primary is just the fraction of the phase that existed prior to the eutectic transformation or, from Figure 9.18, (9.11) The fractions of total (both eutectic and primary), and also of total are determined by use of the lever rule and a tie line that extends entirely across the phase field .

However, below the eutectic temperature, the microstructure will consist of the eutectic andprimary microconstituents because, upon cooling from the liquid, we pass throughthe liquid phase field. When, for case 4 (represented in Figure 9.16), conditions of equilibrium are not maintained while passing through the liquid phase region, the fol-lowing consequences will be realized for the microstructure upon crossing the eu-tectic isotherm: (1) grains of the primary microconstituent will be cored, that is,have a nonuniform distribution of solute across the grains; and (2) the fraction ofthe eutectic microconstituent formed will be greater than for the equilibriumsituation. 9.13 EQUILIBRIUM DIAGRAMS HAVING INTERMEDIATE PHASES OR COMPOUNDS The isomorphous and eutectic phase diagrams discussed thus far are relativelysimple, but those for many binary alloy systems are much more complex. The eu-tectic copper–silver and lead–tin phase diagrams (Figures 9.7 and 9.8) have onlytwo solid phases, and these are sometimes termed terminal solid solutions, because they exist over composition ranges near the concentration extremities ofthe phase diagram. For other alloy systems, intermediate solid solutions (or in- termediate phases) may be found at other than the two composition extremes. Suchis the case for the copper–zinc system. Its phase diagram (Figure 9.19) may at firstappear formidable because there are some invariant points and reactions similarto the eutectic that have not yet been discussed. In addition, there are six differ-ent solid solutions—two terminal ( and ) and four intermediate (The phase is termed an ordered solid solution, one in which the copper andzinc atoms are situated in a specific and ordered arrangement within each unitcell.)

each unitcell.) Some phase boundary lines near the bottom of Figure 9.19 are dashed toindicate that their positions have not been exactly determined. The reason for thisis that at low temperatures, diffusion rates are very slow and inordinately longtimes are required for the attainment of equilibrium. Again, only single- and two-phase regions are found on the diagram, and the same rules outlined in Section9.8 are utilized for computing phase compositions and relative amounts. The com-mercial brasses are copper-rich copper–zinc alloys; for example, cartridge brasshas a composition of 70 wt% Cu–30 wt% Zn and a microstructure consisting ofa single phase. For some systems, discrete intermediate compounds rather than solid solutions may be found on the phase diagram, and these compounds have distinct chemicalformulas; for metal–metal systems, they are called intermetallic compounds.

Several other characteristics are worth noting for this magnesium–lead sys- tem. First, the compound Mg 2Pb melts at approximately ( ), as indi- cated by point M in Figure 9.20.Also, the solubility of lead in magnesium is rather extensive, as indicated by the relatively large composition span for the -phasefield. On the other hand, the solubility of magnesium in lead is extremely lim-ited. This is evident from the very narrow terminal solid-solution region on theright or lead-rich side of the diagram. Finally, this phase diagram may be thoughtof as two simple eutectic diagrams joined back to back, one for the Mg–Mg 2Pb system and the other for Mg 2Pb–Pb; as such, the compound Mg 2Pb is really considered to be a component. This separation of complex phase diagrams intosmaller-component units may simplify them and, furthermore, expedite theirinterpretation. 9.14 EUTECTOID AND PERITECTIC REACTIONS In addition to the eutectic, other invariant points involving three different phasesare found for some alloy systems.

Those for which there are no com-positional alterations are said to be congruent transformations. Conversely, for in- congruent transformations, at least one of the phases will experience a change in composition. Examples of congruent transformations include allotropic transfor-mations (Section 3.6) and melting of pure materials. Eutectic and eutectoid reac-tions, as well as the melting of an alloy that belongs to an isomorphous system, allrepresent incongruent transformations. Intermediate phases are sometimes classified on the basis of whether they melt congruently or incongruently. The intermetallic compound Pb melts con-gruently at the point designated M on the magnesium–lead phase diagram, Fig- ure 9.20.

Companion Site).] 9.16 CERAMIC AND TERNARY PHASE DIAGRAMS It need not be assumed that phase diagrams exist only for metal–metal systems; in fact, phase diagrams that are very useful in the design and processing of ceramicsystems have been experimentally determined for quite a number of these materi-als. Ceramic phase diagrams are discussed in Section 12.7. Phase diagrams have also been determined for metallic (as well as ceramic) systems containing more than two components; however, their representationand interpretation may be exceedingly complex. For example, a ternary, or three-component, com position–temperature phase diagram in its entirety is depicted by a three-dimensional model. Portrayal of features of the diagram or model in twodimensions is possible but somewhat difficult. 9.17 THE GIBBS PHASE RULE The construction of phase diagrams as well as some of the principles governing theconditions for phase equilibria are dictated by laws of thermodynamics. One of theseis the Gibbs phase rule, proposed by the nineteenth-century physicist J. Willard Gibbs. This rule represents a criterion for the number of phases that will coexistwithin a system at equilibrium, and is expressed by the simple equation (9.16) where Pis the number of phases present (the phase concept is discussed in Section 9.3). The parameter Fis termed the number of degrees of freedom or the number of externally controlled variables (e.g., temperature, pressure, composition) whichmust be specified to completely define the state of the system.

Components are nor- mally elements or stable compounds and, in the case of phase diagrams, are the ma- terials at the two extremities of the horizontal compositional axis (e.g., and and Cu and Ni for the phase diagrams shown in Figures 9.1 and 9.3 a, respectively). Finally, Nin Equation 9.16 is the number of noncompositional vari- ables (e.g., temperature and pressure). Let us demonstrate the phase rule by applying it to binary temperature– composition phase diagrams, specifically the copper–silver system, Figure 9.7. Sincepressure is constant (1 atm), the parameter Nis 1—temperature is the only non- compositional variable. Equation 9.16 now takes the form (9.17) Furthermore, the number of components C is 2 (viz. Cu and Ag), and or Consider the case of single-phase fields on the phase diagram (e.g., and liquid regions). Since only one phase is present, and This means that to completely describe the characteristics of any alloy that exists within one of these phase fields, we must specify two parameters; these are com-position and temperature, which locate, respectively, the horizontal and verticalpositions of the alloy on the phase diagram. For the situation wherein two phases coexist, for example, and phase regions, Figure 9.7, the phase rule stipulates that we have but one degree of freedom since Thus, it is necessary to specify either temperature or the composition of one of the phases to completely define the system. For example, suppose that we decideto specify temperature for the phase region, say, in Figure 9.23. Thecompositions of the and liquid phases ( and are thus dictated by theextremities of the tie line constructed at across the field. Note that onlythe nature of the phases is important in this treatment and not the relative phaseamounts. This is to say that the overall alloy composition could lie anywhere alongthis tie line constructed at temperature and still give and compositions forthe respective and liquid phases.

liquid phases. The second alternative is to stipulate the composition of one of the phases for this two-phase situation, which thereby fixes completely the state of the system. Forexample, if we specified as the composition of the phase that is in equilibriumwith the liquid (Figure 9.23), then both the temperature of the alloy ( ) and thecomposition of the liquid phase ( ) are established, again by the tie line drawnacross the phase field so as to give this composition.

This condition is met for a eutectic system by the eutectic isotherm; for theCu–Ag system (Figure 9.7), it is the horizontal line that extends between points B and G. At this temperature, , the points at which each of the phase fields touch the isotherm line correspond to the respective phase compositions;namely, the composition of the phase is fixed at 8.0 wt% Ag, that of the liquid at71.9 wt% Ag, and that of the phase at 91.2 wt% Ag.

Furthermore, all three phases will be in equilibrium for any alloy com-position that lies along the length of the eutectic isotherm (e.g., for the Cu–Agsystem at and compositions between 8.0 and 91.2 wt% Ag). One use of the Gibbs phase rule is in analyzing for nonequilibrium conditions. For example, a microstructure for a binary alloy that developed over a range oftemperatures and consisting of three phases is a nonequilibrium one; under thesecircumstances, three phases will exist only at a single temperature.

( ). All these changes are apparent along the left vertical axis of the phase diagram.1 The composition axis in Figure 9.24 extends only to 6.70 wt% C; at this concen- tration the intermediate compound iron carbide, or cementite (Fe 3C), is formed, which is represented by a vertical line on the phase diagram. Thus, the iron–carbon systemmay be divided into two parts: an iron-rich portion, as in Figure 9.24, and the other(not shown) for compositions between 6.70 and 100 wt% C (pure graphite). In prac-tice, all steels and cast irons have carbon contents less than 6.70 wt% C; therefore,we consider only the iron–iron carbide system. Figure 9.24 would be more appropri-ately labeled the Fe–Fe 3C phase diagram, since Fe 3C is now considered to be a com- ponent. Convention and convenience dictate that composition still be expressed in“wt% C” rather than “wt% Fe 3C”; 6.70 wt% C corresponds to 100 wt% Fe 3C. Carbon is an interstitial impurity in iron and forms a solid solution with each of and ferrites, and also with austenite, as indicated by the and single-phase fields in Figure 9.24. In the BCC ferrite, only small concentrations of car-bon are soluble; the maximum solubility is 0.022 wt% at ( ). The limitedsolubility is explained by the shape and size of the BCC interstitial positions, whichmake it difficult to accommodate the carbon atoms.

Early investiga- tors observed that the ferromagnetic behavior of iron disappears at and attributed thisphenomenon to a phase transformation; the “ ” label was assigned to the high-temperaturephase. Later it was discovered that this loss of magnetism did not result from a phase trans-formation (see Section 20.6) and, therefore, the presumed phase did not exist. bb768/H11034Ca, b, g,Fe 3C b1496T_c09_252-310 11/29/05 11:33 Page 291REVISED PAGESThe austenite, or phase of iron, when alloyed with carbon alone, is not stable below ), as indicated in Figure 9.24.The maximum solubility of carbon in austenite, 2.14 wt%, occurs at ). This solubility is approximately 100 times greater than the maximum for BCC ferrite, since the FCC interstitial positions are larger (see the results of Problem 4.5), and, therefore, the strains im-posed on the surrounding iron atoms are much lower. As the discussions that fol-low demonstrate, phase transformations involving austenite are very important inthe heat treating of steels.

of steels. In passing, it should be mentioned that austenite is non-magnetic. Figure 9.25 bshows a photomicrograph of this austenite phase. The ferrite is virtually the same as ferrite, except for the range of temper- atures over which each exists. Since the ferrite is stable only at relatively hightemperatures, it is of no technological importance and is not discussed further. Cementite (Fe 3C) forms when the solubility limit of carbon in ferrite is ex- ceeded below ) (for compositions within the Fe 3C phase region). As indicated in Figure 9.24, Fe 3C will also coexist with the phase between 727 and (1341 and ). Mechanically, cementite is very hard and brittle; thestrength of some steels is greatly enhanced by its presence. Strictly speaking, cementite is only metastable; that is, it will remain as a com- pound indefinitely at room temperature. However, if heated to between 650 and (1200 and ) for several years, it will gradually change or transform into ironand carbon, in the form of graphite, which will remain upon subsequent cooling toroom temperature. Thus, the phase diagram in Figure 9.24 is not a true equilibriumone because cementite is not an equilibrium compound. However, inasmuch as the de-composition rate of cementite is extremely sluggish, virtually all the carbon in steelwill be as Fe 3C instead of graphite, and the iron–iron carbide phase diagram is, for all practical purposes, valid.As will be seen in Section 11.2, addition of silicon to cast ironsgreatly accelerates this cementite decomposition reaction to form graphite. The two-phase regions are labeled in Figure 9.24. It may be noted that one eu- tectic exists for the iron–iron carbide system, at 4.30 wt% C and ); for this eutectic reaction, (9.18) the liquid solidifies to form austenite and cementite phases.

cementite phases. Of course, subsequentcooling to room temperature will promote additional phase changes. It may be noted that a eutectoid invariant point exists at a composition of 0.76 wt% C and a temperature of ).This eutectoid reaction may be represented by (9.19) or, upon cooling, the solid phase is transformed into iron and cementite. (Eu-tectoid phase transformations were addressed in Section 9.14.) The eutectoid phasechanges described by Equation 9.19 are very important, being fundamental to theheat treatment of steels, as explained in subsequent discussions. Ferrous alloys are those in which iron is the prime component, but carbon as well as other alloying elements may be present. In the classification scheme of fer-rous alloys based on carbon content, there are three types: iron, steel, and cast iron.Commercially pure iron contains less than 0.008 wt% C and, from the phase dia-gram, is composed almost exclusively of the ferrite phase at room temperature.

as steels. In most steels the microstructure consists of both and Fe 3C phases. Upon cooling to room temperature, an alloy within this composition range must passthrough at least a portion of the -phase field; distinctive microstructures are sub-sequently produced, as discussed below.Although a steel alloy may contain as muchas 2.14 wt% C, in practice, carbon concentrations rarely exceed 1.0 wt%. The prop-erties and various classifications of steels are treated in Section 11.2. Cast irons areclassified as ferrous alloys that contain between 2.14 and 6.70 wt% C. However,commercial cast irons normally contain less than 4.5 wt% C. These alloys are dis-cussed further also in Section 11.2. 9.19 DEVELOPMENT OF MICROSTRUCTURE IN IRON–CARBON ALLOYS Several of the various microstructures that may be produced in steel alloys and theirrelationships to the iron–iron carbon phase diagram are now discussed, and it isshown that the microstructure that develops depends on both the carbon contentand heat treatment. This discussion is confined to very slow cooling of steel alloys,in which equilibrium is continuously maintained. A more detailed exploration ofthe influence of heat treatment on microstructure, and ultimately on the mechani-cal properties of steels, is contained in Chapter 10. Phase changes that occur upon passing from the region into the Fe 3C phase field (Figure 9.24) are relatively complex and similar to those described forthe eutectic systems in Section 9.12. Consider, for example, an alloy of eutectoidcomposition (0.76 wt% C) as it is cooled from a temperature within the phase re-gion, say, —that is, beginning at point ain Figure 9.26 and moving down the 800/H11034Cga/H11001 gga9.19 Development of Microstructure in Iron–Carbon Alloys •293 Figure 9.26 Schematic representations of the microstructures for aniron–carbon alloy of eutectoidcomposition (0.76 wt% C) aboveand below the eutectoidtemperature.

As the alloy is cooled, there will occur no changes until the eutectoidtemperature is reached. Upon crossing this temperature to point b, the austenite transforms according to Equation 9.19. The microstructure for this eutectoid steel that is slowly cooled through the eutectoid temperature consists of alternating layers or lamellae of the two phases( and Fe 3C) that form simultaneously during the transformation. In this case, the relative layer thickness is approximately 8 to 1. This microstructure, representedschematically in Figure 9.26, point b , is called pearlite because it has the appear- ance of mother of pearl when viewed under the microscope at low magnifications.Figure 9.27 is a photomicrograph of a eutectoid steel showing the pearlite. Thepearlite exists as grains, often termed “colonies”; within each colony the layersare oriented in essentially the same direction, which varies from one colony toanother. The thick light layers are the ferrite phase, and the cementite phase ap-pears as thin lamellae most of which appear dark. Many cementite layers are sothin that adjacent phase boundaries are so close together that they are indistin-guishable at this magnification, and, therefore, appear dark.

appear dark. Mechanically, pearlitehas properties intermediate between the soft, ductile ferrite and the hard, brittlecementite. The alternating and Fe 3C layers in pearlite form as such for the same rea- son that the eutectic structure (Figures 9.13 and 9.14) forms—because the com-position of the parent phase [in this case austenite (0.76 wt% C)] is differentfrom either of the product phases [ferrite (0.022 wt% C) and cementite (6.7 wt%C)], and the phase transformation requires that there be a redistribution of thecarbon by diffusion. Figure 9.28 illustrates schematically microstructural changesthat accompany this eutectoid reaction; here the directions of carbon diffusionare indicated by arrows. Carbon atoms diffuse away from the 0.022 wt% ferriteregions and to the 6.7 wt% cementite layers, as the pearlite extends from thegrain boundary into the unreacted austenite grain. The layered pearlite forms be-cause carbon atoms need diffuse only minimal distances with the formation ofthis structure. Furthermore, subsequent cooling of the pearlite from point bin Figure 9.26 will produce relatively insignificant microstructural changes.aa(727/H11034C)xx¿.294 •Chapter 9 / Phase Diagrams Figure 9.27 Photomicrograph of a eutectoid steel showing the pearlite microstructure consisting of alternating layers of ferrite(the light phase) and Fe 3C (thin layers most of which appear dark).

the figure. In cooling to point d, about , which is within the phase region, both these phases will coexist as in the schematic microstruc- ture. Most of the small particles will form along the original grain boundaries. The compositions of both and phases may be determined using the appropriatetie line; these compositions correspond, respectively, to about 0.020 and 0.40 wt% C. While cooling an alloy through the phase region, the composition of the ferrite phase changes with temperature along the phase boundary, line MN, becoming slightly richer in carbon. On the other hand, the change in compo-sition of the austenite is more dramatic, proceeding along the boundary, line MO, as the temperature is reduced. Cooling from point d to e, just above the eutectoid but still in the region, will produce an increased fraction of the phase and a microstructure similar tothat also shown: the particles will have grown larger. At this point, the composi-tions of the and phases are determined by constructing a tie line at the tem-perature the phase will contain 0.022 wt% C, while the phase will be of theeutectoid composition, 0.76 wt% C. As the temperature is lowered just below the eutectoid, to point f, all the phase that was present at temperature (and having the eutectoid composition)will transform to pearlite, according to the reaction in Equation 9.19. There will bevirtually no change in the phase that existed at point ein crossing the eutectoid temperature—it will normally be present as a continuous matrix phase surround-ing the isolated pearlite colonies. The microstructure at point fwill appear as the corresponding schematic inset of Figure 9.29. Thus the ferrite phase will be presentboth in the pearlite and also as the phase that formed while cooling through the phase region. The ferrite that is present in the pearlite is called eutectoid ferrite, whereas the other, that formed above is termed proeutectoid (meaning pre- or before eutectoid) ferrite, as labeled in Figure 9.29.

We use the lever rule in conjunction with a tie line that extends fromthe phase boundary (0.022 wt% C) to the eutectoid composition (0.76 wt% C), inasmuch as pearlite is the transformation product of austenite havingthis composition. For example, let us consider an alloy of composition in Fig-ure 9.31.

Consider an alloy of composition in Figure 9.32 that,upon cooling, moves down the line At point gonly the phase will be present with a composition of the microstructure will appear as shown, having only grains. Upon cooling into the phase field—say, to point h—the cementite phase will begin to form along the initial grain boundaries, similar to the phasein Figure 9.29, point d. This cementite is called proeutectoid cementite—that which forms before the eutectoid reaction. Of course, the cementite composition remainsconstant (6.70 wt% C) as the temperature changes. However, the composition ofthe austenite phase will move along line POtoward the eutectoid. As the temper- ature is lowered through the eutectoid to point i, all remaining austenite of eutec- toid composition is converted into pearlite; thus, the resulting microstructure con-sists of pearlite and proeutectoid cementite as microconstituents (Figure 9.32).

Both are discussed in the next chapter. 9.20 THE INFLUENCE OF OTHER ALLOYING ELEMENTS Additions of other alloying elements (Cr, Ni, Ti, etc.) bring about rather dramaticchanges in the binary iron–iron carbide phase diagram, Figure 9.24. The extentof these alterations of the positions of phase boundaries and the shapes of thephase fields depends on the particular alloying element and its concentration.One of the important changes is the shift in position of the eutectoid with re-spect to temperature and to carbon concentration. These effects are illustratedin Figures 9.34 and 9.35, which plot the eutectoid temperature and eutectoidcomposition (in wt% C) as a function of concentration for several other alloy-ing elements. Thus, other alloy additions alter not only the temperature of theeutectoid reaction but also the relative fractions of pearlite and the proeutectoidphase that form. Steels are normally alloyed for other reasons, however—usuallyeither to improve their corrosion resistance or to render them amenable to heattreatment (see Section 11.8).9.20 The Influence of Other Alloying Elements •301 Concentration of alloying elements (wt%)Eutectoid temperature (°C) Eutectoid temperature (°F) 02468 1 0 1 2 1 410001200140016001800200022002400 600800Ti Mo SiW Cr Mn10001200 NiFigure 9.34 The dependence of eutectoid temperature on alloy concentration for several alloyingelements in steel.

This discussion beganby considering the unary (or pressure–temperature) phase diagram for a one-component system. Solid-, liquid-, and vapor-phase regions are found on this typeof phase diagram. For binary systems, temperature and composition are variables,whereas external pressure is held constant. Areas, or phase regions, are definedon these temperature-versus-composition plots within which either one or twophases exist. For an alloy of specified composition and at a known tempera-ture, the phases present, their compositions, and relative amounts under equilib-rium conditions may be determined.

Iso- morphous diagrams are those for which there is complete solubility in the solidphase; the copper–nickel system displays this behavior. Also discussed for alloys be-longing to isomorphous systems were the development of microstructure for bothcases of equilibrium and nonequilibrium cooling, and the dependence of mechani-cal characteristics on composition. Binary Eutectic Systems Development of Microstructure in Eutectic Alloys In a eutectic reaction, as found in some alloy systems, a liquid phase transforms isothermally to two different solid phases upon cooling.

upon cooling. Such a reaction is noted onthe copper–silver and lead–tin phase diagrams. Complete solid solubility for all com-positions does not exist; instead, solid solutions are terminal—there is only a lim-ited solubility of each component in the other. Four different kinds of microstruc-tures that may develop for the equilibrium cooling of alloys belonging to eutecticsystems were discussed. Equilibrium Diagrams Having Intermediate Phases or Compounds Eutectoid and Peritectic ReactionsCongruent Phase Transformations Other equilibrium phase diagrams are more complex, having intermediate com- pounds and/or phases, possibly more than a single eutectic, and other reactions in-cluding eutectoid, peritectic, and congruent phase transformations. These are foundfor copper–zinc and magnesium–lead systems.302 •Chapter 9 / Phase Diagrams 1496T_c09_252-310 11/29/05 11:33 Page 302REVISED PAGESThe Gibbs Phase Rule The Gibbs phase rule was introduced; it is a simple equation that relates the num- ber of phases present in a system at equilibrium with the number of degrees of free-dom, the number of components, and the number of noncompositional variables. The Iron–Iron Carbide (Fe–Fe 3C) Phase Diagram Development of Microstructure in Iron–Carbon Alloys Considerable attention was given to the iron–carbon system, and specifically, the iron–iron carbide phase diagram, which technologically is one of the most im-portant.The development of microstructure in many iron–carbon alloys and steelsdepends on the eutectoid reaction in which the FCC austenite phase of compo-sition 0.76 wt% C transforms isothermally to the BCC ferrite phase (0.022 wt%C) and the intermetallic compound, cementite (Fe 3C).

(Fe 3C). The microstructural prod- uct of an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composition is pearlite, a microcon-stituent consisting of alternating layers of ferrite and cementite. The microstruc-tures of alloys having carbon contents less than the eutectoid (hypoeutectoid) arecomprised of a proeutectoid ferrite phase in addition to pearlite. On the otherhand, pearlite and proeutectoid cementite constitute the microconstituents forhypereutectoid alloys—those with carbon contents in excess of the eutectoidcomposition.aReferences •303 IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS AusteniteCementiteComponentCongruent transformationEquilibriumEutectic phaseEutectic reactionEutectic structureEutectoid reactionFerriteFree energyGibbs phase ruleHypereutectoid alloyHypoeutectoid alloyIntermediate solid solutionIntermetallic compoundInvariant pointIsomorphousLever ruleLiquidus lineMetastableMicroconstituentPearlitePeritectic reactionPhasePhase diagramPhase equilibriumPrimary phaseProeutectoid cementiteProeutectoid ferriteSolidus lineSolubility limitSolvus lineSystemTerminal solid solutionTie line REFERENCES ASM Handbook, Vol. 3, Alloy Phase Diagrams, ASM International, Materials Park, OH,1992.

For example, thetensile strength of an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoidcomposition (0.76 wt% C) can be varied betweenapproximately 700 MPa (100,000 psi) and 2000 MPa(300,000 psi) depending on the heat treatmentemployed.

Additional tech-niques are available wherein the mechanical properties are reliant on the charac-teristics of the microstructure. The development of microstructure in both single- and two-phase alloys ordi- narily involves some type of phase transformation—an alteration in the numberand/or character of the phases. The first portion of this chapter is devoted to a briefdiscussion of some of the basic principles relating to transformations involving solidphases. Inasmuch as most phase transformations do not occur instantaneously,consideration is given to the dependence of reaction progress on time, or the trans- formation rate. This is followed by a discussion of the development of two-phase microstructures for iron–carbon alloys. Modified phase diagrams are introduced thatpermit determination of the microstructure that results from a specific heat treat-ment.

heat treat-ment. Finally, other microconstituents in addition to pearlite are presented, and, foreach, the mechanical properties are discussed. Phase Transformations 10.2 BASIC CONCEPTS A variety of phase transformations are important in the processing of materials, and usually they involve some alteration of the microstructure. For purposes of thisdiscussion, these transformations are divided into three classifications. In one groupare simple diffusion-dependent transformations in which there is no change in ei-ther the number or composition of the phases present. These include solidificationof a pure metal, allotropic transformations, and, recrystallization and grain growth(see Sections 7.12 and 7.13). In another type of diffusion-dependent transformation, there is some alteration in phase compositions and often in the number of phases present; the final mi-crostructure ordinarily consists of two phases. The eutectoid reaction, described byEquation 9.19, is of this type; it receives further attention in Section 10.5.Learning Objectives After careful study of this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1.Make a schematic fraction transformation- versus-logarithm of time plot for a typicalsolid–solid transformation; cite the equationthat describes this behavior. 2.Briefly describe the microstructure for each ofthe following microconstituents that are foundin steel alloys: fine pearlite, coarse pearlite,spheroidite, bainite, martensite, and temperedmartensite. 3.Cite the general mechanical characteristics foreach of the following microconstituents: finepearlite, coarse pearlite, spheroidite, bainite, martensite, and tempered martensite. Now, interms of microstructure (or crystal structure),briefly explain these behaviors. 4.Given the isothermal transformation (or contin-uous cooling transformation) diagram for someiron–carbon alloy, design a heat treatment thatwill produce a specified microstructure.

specified microstructure. transformation rate phase transformation1496T_c10_311-357 12/31/05 9:55 Page 3122nd REVISE PAGESThe third kind of transformation is diffusionless, wherein a metastable phase is produced. As discussed in Section 10.5, a martensitic transformation, which may be induced in some steel alloys, falls into this category. 10.3 THE KINETICS OF PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS With phase transformations, normally at least one new phase is formed that hasdifferent physical/chemical characteristics and/or a different structure than theparent phase. Furthermore, most phase transformations do not occur instanta-neously. Rather, they begin by the formation of numerous small particles of thenew phase(s), which increase in size until the transformation has reached comple-tion. The progress of a phase transformation may be broken down into two distinctstages: nucleation and growth. Nucleation involves the appearance of very small particles, or nuclei of the new phase (often consisting of only a few hundred atoms),which are capable of growing. During the growth stage these nuclei increase in size,which results in the disappearance of some (or all) of the parent phase. The trans-formation reaches completion if the growth of these new phase particles is allowedto proceed until the equilibrium fraction is attained. We now discuss the mechan-ics of these two processes, and how they relate to solid-state transformations. Nucleation There are two types of nucleation: homogeneous and heterogeneous. The distinction between them is made according to the site at which nucleating events occur. Forthe homogeneous type, nuclei of the new phase form uniformly throughout theparent phase, whereas for the heterogeneous type, nuclei form preferentially atstructural inhomogeneities, such as container surfaces, insoluble impurities, grainboundaries, dislocations, and so on. We begin by discussing homogeneous nucle-ation because its description and theory are simpler to treat.

to treat. These principles arethen extended to a discussion of the heterogeneous type. Homogeneous Nucleation A discussion of the theory of nucleation involves a thermodynamic parameter calledfree energy (or Gibbs free energy), G. In brief, free energy is a function of other thermodynamic parameters, of which one is the internal energy of the system (i.e.,the enthalpy, H ), and another is a measurement of the randomness or disorder of the atoms or molecules (i.e., the entropy, S). It is not our purpose here to provide a detailed discussion of the principles of thermodynamics as they apply to materi-als systems. However, relative to phase transformations, an important thermodynamicparameter is the change in free energy a transformation will occur sponta-neously only when has a negative value. For the sake of simplicity, let us first consider the solidification of a pure mate- rial, assuming that nuclei of the solid phase form in the interior of the liquid as atomscluster together so as to form a packing arrangement similar to that found in thesolid phase. Furthermore, it will be assumed that each nucleus is spherical in geom-etry and has a radius r. This situation is represented schematically in Figure 10.1. There are two contributions to the total free energy change that accompany a solidification transformation. The first is the free energy difference between thesolid and liquid phases, or the volume free energy, . Its value will be negativeif the temperature is below the equilibrium solidification temperature, and the mag-nitude of its contribution is the product of and the volume of the spherical nu-cleus (i.e., . The second energy contribution results from the formation of the 4 3pr3)¢Gv¢Gv¢G¢G;10.3 The Kinetics of Phase Transformations •313 free energynucleation, growth1496T_c10_311-357 11/30/05 7:37 Page 313REVISED PAGES314 •Chapter 10 / Phase Transformations in Metals Volume = Solid Solid-liquid interfaceArea = 4/H9266r2rLiquid/H9266 r34 3Figure 10.1 Schematic diagram showing the nucleation of a spherical solid particle in a liquid.

Associated with this boundary is a surface free energy, , which is positive; furthermore, themagnitude of this contribution is the product of and the surface area of the nu-cleus (i.e., ). Finally, the total free energy change is equal to the sum of thesetwo contributions—that is, (10.1) These volume, surface, and total free energy contributions are plotted schemati-cally as a function of nucleus radius in Figures 10.2a and 10.2b . Here (Figure 10.2 a) it will be noted that for the curve corresponding to the first term on the right-handside of Equation 10.1, the free energy (which is negative) decreases with the thirdpower of r . Furthermore, for the curve resulting from the second term in Equa- tion 10.1, energy values are positive and increase with the square of the radius.Consequently, the curve associated with the sum of both terms (Figure 10.2 b) first increases, passes through a maximum, and finally decreases. In a physical sense,this means that as a solid particle begins to form as atoms in the liquid cluster to-gether, its free energy first increases.

first increases.

On the other hand, a cluster of radius less than the criti- cal will shrink and redissolve. This subcritical particle is an embryo, whereas the particle of radius greater than is termed a nucleus. A critical free energy, occurs at the critical radius and, consequently, at the maximum of the curve inFigure 10.2 b. This corresponds to an activation free energy, which is the free energy required for the formation of a stable nucleus. Equivalently, it may be con-sidered an energy barrier to the nucleation process. Since and appear at the maximum on the free energy-versus-radius curve of Figure 10.2b, derivation of expressions for these two parameters is a simple mat-ter. For , we differentiate the equation (Equation 10.1) with respect to r, set the resulting expression equal to zero, and then solve for . That is, (10.2) which leads to the result (10.3) Now, substitution of this expression for into Equation 10.1 yields the followingexpression for : (10.4) This volume free energy change is the driving force for the solidification transformation, and its magnitude is a function of temperature. At the equilibriumsolidification temperature , the value of is zero, and with diminishing tem-perature its value becomes increasingly more negative. It can be shown that is a function of temperature as (10.5) where is the latent heat of fusion (i.e., the heat given up during solidification),and and the temperature Tare in Kelvin.

in Kelvin. Substitution of this expression for into Equations 10.3 and 10.4 yields (10.6) and (10.7) Thus, from these two equations, both the critical radius and the activation free en-ergy decrease as temperature Tdecreases. (The and parameters in these expressions are relatively insensitive to temperature changes.) Figure 10.3, a schematic -versus-r plot that shows curves for two different temperatures, illustrates these relationships. Physically, this means that with a lowering of temperature at tempera-tures below the equilibrium solidification temperature nucleation occurs more (T m),¢G¢Hf g ¢G*r*¢G*/H11005a16pg3Tm2 3¢Hf2b 1 1Tm/H11002T22r*/H11005a/H110022gTm ¢Hfb a1 Tm/H11002Tb¢Gv Tm¢Hf¢Gv/H11005¢Hf 1Tm/H11002T2 Tm¢Gv¢Gv Tm¢Gv¢G*/H1100516pg3 31¢Gv22¢G*r*r*/H11005/H110022g ¢Gvd1¢G2 dr/H110054 3 p¢Gv13r22/H110014pg12r2/H110050r (/H11005 r*)¢G r*¢G* r*¢G*¢G*, r* Activation free energy expressionFor homogeneous nucleation, criticalradius of a stablesolid particle nucleus For homogeneous nucleation,activation freeenergy required forthe formation of astable nucleus Dependence of critical radius onsurface free energy,latent heat of fusion,melting temperature,and transformationtemperature1496T_c10_311-357 11/30/05 7:37 Page 315REVISED PAGESreadily.

315REVISED PAGESreadily. Furthermore, the number of stable nuclei (having radii greater than ) is a function of temperature as (10.8) where the constant is related to the total number of nuclei of the solid phase.For the exponential term of this expression, changes in temperature have a greatereffect on the magnitude of the term in the numerator than the Tterm in the denominator. Consequently, as the temperature is lowered below the exponen-tial term in Equation 10.8 also decreases such that the magnitude of increases.This temperature dependence ( versus T) is represented in the schematic plot of Figure 10.4a. There is another important temperature-dependent step that is involved in and also influences nucleation: the clustering of atoms by short-range diffusion duringthe formation of nuclei. The influence of temperature on the rate of diffusion (i.e.,magnitude of the diffusion coefficient, D) is given in Equation 5.8. Furthermore, this diffusion effect is related to the frequency at which atoms from the liquid at-tach themselves to the solid nucleus, . Or, the dependence of on temperatureis the same as for the diffusion coefficient—namely, (10.9) n d/H11005K2 exp a /H11002Qd kTbnd ndn*n*Tm¢G*K1n*/H11005K1 exp a /H11002¢G* kTbr* n*316 •Chapter 10 / Phase Transformations in Metals Figure 10.3 Schematic free- energy-versus-embryo/nucleus- radius curves for two differenttemperatures.

Thus, from Equation 10.9a diminishment of temperature results in a reduction in . This effect, representedby the curve shown in Figure 10.4 b, is just the reverse of that for as discussed above. The principles and concepts just developed are now extended to a discussion of another important nucleation parameter, the nucleation rate (which has unitsof nuclei per unit volume per second). This rate is simply proportional to the prod-uct of (Equation 10.8) and (Equation 10.9); that is, (10.10) Here is the number of atoms on a nucleus surface. Figure 10.4 cschematically plots nucleation rate as a function of temperature and, in addition, the curves ofFigures 10.4a and 10.4b from which the curve is derived. Note (Figure 10.4 c) that, with a lowering of temperature from below , the nucleation rate first increases,achieves a maximum, and subsequently diminishes. The shape of this curve is explained as follows: for the upper region of the curve (a sudden and dramatic increase in with decreasing T), is greater than , which means that the exp term of Equation 10.10 is much smaller than exp . In other words, the nucleation rate is suppressed at hightemperatures due to a small activation driving force.

driving force. With continued diminishmentof temperature, there comes a point at which becomes smaller than thetemperature-independent with the result that exp , or that, at lower temperatures, a low atomic mobility suppresses the nucleationrate. This accounts for the shape of the lower curve segment (a precipitous reduc-tion of with a continued diminishment of temperature). Furthermore, the curve of Figure 10.4 cnecessarily passes through a maximum over the intermedi- ate temperature range where values for and are of approximately thesame magnitude. Several qualifying comments are in order regarding the above discussion. First, although we assumed a spherical shape for nuclei, this method may be applied toany shape with the same final result. Furthermore, this treatment may be utilizedfor types of transformations other than solidification (i.e., liquid–solid)—for exam-ple, solid–vapor and solid–solid. However, magnitudes of and , in addition todiffusion rates of the atomic species, will undoubtedly differ among the varioustransformation types. In addition, for solid–solid transformations, there may bevolume changes attendant to the formation of new phases. These changes may leadto the introduction of microscopic strains, which must be taken into account in the expression of Equation 10.1, and, consequently, will affect the magnitudes of and . From Figure 10.4 cit is apparent that during the cooling of a liquid, an appreciable nucleation rate (i.e., solidification) will begin only after the temper-ature has been lowered to below the equilibrium solidification (or melting) tem-perature . This phenomenon is termed supercooling (or undercooling), and the degree of supercooling for homogeneous nucleation may be significant (onthe order of several hundred degrees Kelvin) for some systems. In Table 10.1 istabulated, for several materials, typical degrees of supercooling for homogeneousnucleation.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 10.1 Computation of Critical Nucleus Radius and Activation Free Energy (a)For the solidification of pure gold, calculate the critical radius and the activation free energy if nucleation is homogeneous.Values for the latent heat of fusion and surface free energy are J/m3and 0.132 J/m2, respectively. Use the supercooling value found in Table 10.1. (b)Now calculate the number of atoms found in a nucleus of critical size. As- sume a lattice parameter of 0.413 nm for solid gold at its melting temperature. Solution(a)In order to compute the critical radius, we employ Equation 10.6, using the melting temperature of for gold, assuming a supercooling value of (Table 10.1), and realizing that is negative. Hence For computation of the activation free energy, Equation 10.7 is employed.

per unitcell. The number of unit cells found in this critical nucleus is just the ratio ofcritical nucleus and unit cell volumes. Inasmuch as gold has the FCC crystalstructure (and a cubic unit cell), its unit cell volume is just , where ais the lat- tice parameter (i.e., unit cell edge length); its value is 0.413 nm, as cited in theproblem statement. Therefore, the number of unit cells found in a radius of crit-ical size is just (10.11) Inasmuch as there is the equivalence of four atoms per FCC unit cell (Sec-tion 3.4), the total number of atoms per critical nucleus is just (137 unit cells/critical nucleus)(4 atoms/unit cell) atoms/critical nucleus /H11005 548 /H11005a4 3b1p211.32 nm23 10.413 nm 23/H11005137 unit cells# unit cells/particle /H11005critical nucleus volume unit cell volume/H110054 3 pr*3 a3a3r* Heterogeneous Nucleation Although levels of supercooling for homogeneous nucleation may be significant (onoccasion several hundred degrees Celsius), in practical situations they are often onthe order of only several degrees Celsius. The reason for this is that the activationenergy (i.e., energy barrier) for nucleation ( of Equation 10.4) is lowered whennuclei form on preexisting surfaces or interfaces, since the surface free energy (of Equation 10.4) is reduced. In other words, it is easier for nucleation to occur atsurfaces and interfaces than at other sites. Again, this type of nucleation is termedheterogeneous. In order to understand this phenomenon, let us consider the nucleation, on a flat surface, of a solid particle from a liquid phase. It is assumed that both the liq-uid and solid phases “wet” this flat surface, that is, both of these phases spread outand cover the surface; this configuration is depicted schematically in Figure 10.5.Also noted in the figure are three interfacial energies (represented as vectors) thatexist at two-phase boundaries— and —as well as the wetting angle (theangle between the and vectors).

Now, using a somewhat involved procedure similar to the one presented above for homogeneous nucleation (which we have chosen to omit), it is possible to derive equations for and these are as follows: (10.13) (10.14) The term of this last equation is a function only of (i.e., the shape of the nu- cleus), which will have a numerical value between zero and unity.1 From Equation 10.13, it is important to note that the critical radius for hetero- geneous nucleation is the same as for homogeneous, inasmuch as is the same sur-face energy as in Equation 10.3. It is also evident that the activation energy barrierfor heterogeneous nucleation (Equation 10.14) is smaller than the homogeneous bar-rier (Equation 10.4) by an amount corresponding to the value of this function, or (10.15) Figure 10.6, a schematic graph of versus nucleus radius, plots curves for bothtypes of nucleation, and indicates the difference in the magnitudes of and in addition to the constancy of .

of . This lower for heterogeneous means that a smaller energy must be overcome during the nucleation process (than for ho-mogeneous), and, therefore, heterogeneous nucleation occurs more readily (Equa-tion 10.10). In terms of the nucleation rate, the versus Tcurve (Figure 10.4 c) is shifted to higher temperatures for heterogeneous. This effect is represented in Fig-ure 10.7, which also shows that a much smaller degree of supercooling isrequired for heterogeneous nucleation.

Further- more, the growth process will cease in any region where particles of the new phasemeet, since here the transformation will have reached completion. Particle growth occurs by long-range atomic diffusion, which normally involves several steps—for example, diffusion through the parent phase, across a phaseboundary, and then into the nucleus. Consequently, the growth rate is determinedby the rate of diffusion, and its temperature dependence is the same as for the dif-fusion coefficient (Equation 5.8)—namely, (10.16) where Q(the activation energy) and C(a preexponential) are independent of tem- perature.

combined effect. The general shape of this curve is the same as for the nucleation rate, in that it has a peak or maximum that has been shifted upward relative to the curve. Whereas this treatment on transformations has been developed for solidification, the same general principles also apply to solid–solid and solid–gas transformations. As we shall see below, the rate of transformation and the time required for the transformation to proceed to some degree of completion (e.g., time to 50% reactioncompletion, ) are inversely proportional to one another (Equation 10.18). Thus, ifthe logarithm of this transformation time (i.e., log ) is plotted versus temperature,a curve having the general shape shown in Figure 10.9 bresults. This “C-shaped” curve is a virtual mirror image (through a vertical plane) of the transformation ratecurve of Figure 10.8, as demonstrated in Figure 10.9. It is often the case that thekinetics of phase transformations are represented using logarithm time- (to somedegree of transformation) versus-temperature plots (for example, see Section 10.5). Several physical phenomena may be explained in terms of the transformation rate-versus-temperature curve of Figure 10.8. First, the size of the product phaseparticles will depend on transformation temperature. For example, for transforma-tions that occur at temperatures near to corresponding to low nucleation andhigh growth rates, few nuclei form that grow rapidly. Thus, the resulting micro-structure will consist of few and relatively large phase particles (e.g., coarse grains).Conversely, for transformations at lower temperatures, nucleation rates are highand growth rates low, which results in many small particles (e.g., fine grains). Also, from Figure 10.8, when a material is cooled very rapidly through the tem- perature range encompassed by the transformation rate curve to a relatively lowtemperature where the rate is extremely low, it is possible to produce nonequilib-rium phase structures (for example, see Sections 10.5 and 11.9).

and 11.9). Kinetic Considerations of Solid-State Transformations The previous discussion of this section has centered on the temperature dependencesof nucleation, growth, and transformation rates. The time dependence of rate (which is often termed the kinetics of a transformation) is also an important consideration, often in the heat treatment of materials. Also, since many transformations of inter-est to materials scientists and engineers involve only solid phases, we have decidedto devote the following discussion to the kinetics of solid-state transformations. With many kinetic investigations, the fraction of reaction that has occurred is measured as a function of time while the temperature is maintained constant.Trans-formation progress is usually ascertained by either microscopic examination or mea-surement of some physical property (such as electrical conductivity) the magnitudeT m,t0.5t0.5N#322 •Chapter 10 / Phase Transformations in Metals Figure 10.9 Schematic plots of (a) transformation rate versus temperature, and (b) logarithm time [to some degree (e.g., 0.5 fraction) of transformation] versus temperature.

Data are plotted as the fraction of trans- formed material versus the logarithm of time; an S-shaped curve similar to that inFigure 10.10 represents the typical kinetic behavior for most solid-state reactions.Nucleation and growth stages are also indicated in the figure. For solid-state transformations displaying the kinetic behavior in Figure 10.10, the fraction of transformation y is a function of time t as follows: (10.17) where kand nare time-independent constants for the particular reaction.The above expression is often referred to as the Avrami equation.

are shown. A detailed discussion on the influence of both temperature and time on phase transformations is provided in Section 10.5. 10.4 METASTABLE VERSUS EQUILIBRIUM STATES Phase transformations may be wrought in metal alloy systems by varying tempera-ture, composition, and the external pressure; however, temperature changes by meansof heat treatments are most conveniently utilized to induce phase transformations.This corresponds to crossing a phase boundary on the composition-temperaturephase diagram as an alloy of given composition is heated or cooled. During a phase transformation, an alloy proceeds toward an equilibrium state that is characterized by the phase diagram in terms of the product phases, theircompositions, and relative amounts.As the previous section noted, most phase trans-formations require some finite time to go to completion, and the speed or rate isoften important in the relationship between the heat treatment and the develop-ment of microstructure. One limitation of phase diagrams is their inability to indi-cate the time period required for the attainment of equilibrium. The rate of approach to equilibrium for solid systems is so slow that true equilibrium structures are rarely achieved.When phase transformations are inducedby temperature changes, equilibrium conditions are maintained only if heating orcooling is carried out at extremely slow and unpractical rates. For other thanequilibrium cooling, transformations are shifted to lower temperatures than indi-cated by the phase diagram; for heating, the shift is to higher temperatures. Thesephenomena are termed supercooling and superheating, respectively. The degree of each depends on the rate of temperature change; the more rapid the cooling orheating, the greater the supercooling or superheating. For example, for normal cool-ing rates the iron–carbon eutectoid reaction is typically displaced 10 to (18 to F) below the equilibrium transformation temperature. 3 For many technologically important alloys, the preferred state or microstruc- ture is a metastable one, intermediate between the initial and equilibrium states;on occasion, a structure far removed from the equilibrium one is desired.

is desired. It thusbecomes imperative to investigate the influence of time on phase transformations.This kinetic information is, in many instances, of greater value than a knowledgeof the final equilibrium state. Microstructural and Property Changes in Iron–Carbon Alloys Some of the basic kinetic principles of solid-state transformations are now extendedand applied specifically to iron–carbon alloys in terms of the relationships amongheat treatment, the development of microstructure, and mechanical properties. This36/H1103420/H11034C 3 It is important to note that the treatments relating to the kinetics of phase transforma- tions in Section 10.3 are constrained to the condition of constant temperature. By way of contrast, the discussion of this section pertains to phase transformations that occur withchanging temperature. This same distinction exists between Sections 10.5 (IsothermalTransformation Diagrams) and 10.6 (Continuous Cooling Transformation Diagrams).supercooling superheating1496T_c10_311-357 11/30/05 7:37 Page 324REVISED PAGES10.5 Isothermal Transformation Diagrams •325 system has been chosen because it is familiar and because a wide variety of mi- crostructures and mechanical properties are possible for iron–carbon (or steel) alloys. 10.5 ISOTHERMAL TRANSFORMATION DIAGRAMS Pearlite Consider again the iron–iron carbide eutectoid reaction (10.19) which is fundamental to the development of microstructure in steel alloys. Uponcooling, austenite, having an intermediate carbon concentration, transforms to a fer-rite phase, having a much lower carbon content, and also cementite, with a muchhigher carbon concentration. Pearlite is one microstructural product of this trans-formation (Figure 9.27), and the mechanism of pearlite formation was discussedpreviously (Section 9.19) and demonstrated in Figure 9.28.

Figure 9.28. Temperature plays an important role in the rate of the austenite-to-pearlite transformation. The temperature dependence for an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoidcomposition is indicated in Figure 10.12, which plots S-shaped curves of the per-centage transformation versus the logarithm of time at three different temperatures.For each curve, data were collected after rapidly cooling a specimen composed of100% austenite to the temperature indicated; that temperature was maintained con-stant throughout the course of the reaction. A more convenient way of representing both the time and temperature de- pendence of this transformation is in the bottom portion of Figure 10.13. Here, thevertical and horizontal axes are, respectively, temperature and the logarithm of time.Two solid curves are plotted; one represents the time required at each temperaturefor the initiation or start of the transformation; the other is for the transformationconclusion. The dashed curve corresponds to 50% of transformation completion.These curves were generated from a series of plots of the percentage transforma-tion versus the logarithm of time taken over a range of temperatures. The S-shapedcurve [for ( )], in the upper portion of Figure 10.13, illustrates how thedata transfer is made. In interpreting this diagram, note first that the eutectoid temperature [ ( )] is indicated by a horizontal line; at temperatures above the eutectoid and1341/H11034F727/H11034C1247/H11034F 675/H11034Cg10.76 wt% C 2 Δcooling heatinga10.022 wt% C 2/H11001Fe3C16.70 wt% C 2Eutectoid reaction for the iron-ironcarbide system Time (s)Percent pearlite Percent austenite 11 0 1 021030100500 50100 600°C 650°C 675°CFigure 10.12 For an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composition(0.76 wt% C),isothermal fractionreacted versus thelogarithm of time for the austenite-to-pearlitetransformation.1496T_c10_311-357 11/30/05 7:37 Page 325REVISED PAGESfor all times, only austenite will exist, as indicated in the figure.The austenite-to-pearlite transformation will occur only if an alloy is supercooled to below the eutectoid; as in-dicated by the curves, the time necessary for the transformation to begin and then enddepends on temperature.

on temperature. The start and finish curves are nearly parallel, and they ap-proach the eutectoid line asymptotically. To the left of the transformation start curve,only austenite (which is unstable) will be present, whereas to the right of the finishcurve, only pearlite will exist. In between, the austenite is in the process of transform-ing to pearlite, and thus both microconstituents will be present. According to Equation 10.18, the transformation rate at some particular temper- ature is inversely proportional to the time required for the reaction to proceed to 50%completion (to the dashed line in Figure 10.13). That is, the shorter this time, thehigher is the rate. Thus, from Figure 10.13, at temperatures just below the eutectoid (corresponding to just a slight degree of undercooling) very long times (on the orderof s) are required for the 50% transformation, and therefore the reaction rate isvery slow. The transformation rate increases with decreasing temperature such that at ( ) only about 3 s is required for the reaction to go to 50% completion. Several constraints are imposed on using diagrams like Figure 10.13. First, this particular plot is valid only for an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composi-tion; for other compositions, the curves will have different configurations. Inaddition, these plots are accurate only for transformations in which the temper-ature of the alloy is held constant throughout the duration of the reaction. Condi- tions of constant temperature are termed isothermal; thus, plots such as Figure 10.13 are referred to as isothermal transformation diagrams, or sometimes as time–temperature–transformation (or T–T–T ) plots.1000/H11034F 540/H11034C10 5326 •Chapter 10 / Phase Transformations in Metals Figure 10.13 Demonstration of howan isothermaltransformation diagram(bottom) is generatedfrom percentagetransformation-versus-logarithm of timemeasurements (top).

Very rapid cooling of austenite to a temperature is indicated by the near-verticalline AB, and the isothermal treatment at this temperature is represented by the horizontal segment BCD. Of course, time increases from left to right along this line.The transformation of austenite to pearlite begins at the intersection, point C(af- ter approximately 3.5 s), and has reached completion by about 15 s, correspondingto point D. Figure 10.14 also shows schematic microstructures at various times dur- ing the progression of the reaction. The thickness ratio of the ferrite and cementite layers in pearlite is approxi- mately 8 to 1. However, the absolute layer thickness depends on the temperatureat which the isothermal transformation is allowed to occur. At temperatures justbelow the eutectoid, relatively thick layers of both the -ferrite and Fe 3C phases are produced; this microstructure is called coarse pearlite, and the region at which it forms is indicated to the right of the completion curve on Figure 10.14.

Figure 10.14. At thesetemperatures, diffusion rates are relatively high, such that during the transforma-tion illustrated in Figure 9.28 carbon atoms can diffuse relatively long distances,which results in the formation of thick lamellae. With decreasing temperature, thecarbon diffusion rate decreases, and the layers become progressively thinner. Thethin-layered structure produced in the vicinity of is termed fine pearlite; this is also indicated in Figure 10.14. To be discussed in Section 10.7 is the dependenceof mechanical properties on lamellar thickness.

A portion of one such diagramfor a 1.13 wt% C alloy is shown in Figure 10.16. Bainite In addition to pearlite, other microconstituents that are products of the austenitictransformation exist; one of these is called bainite. The microstructure of bainite consists of ferrite and cementite phases, and thus diffusional processes are involved328 •Chapter 10 / Phase Transformations in Metals Figure 10.15 Photomicrographs of (a) coarse pearlite and (b ) fine pearlite.

been labeled. In addition, the phase thatsurrounds the needle is martensite, the topic to which a subsequent section isaddressed. Furthermore, no proeutectoid phase forms with bainite. The time–temperature dependence of the bainite transformation may also be represented on the isothermal transformation diagram. It occurs at temperaturesbelow those at which pearlite forms; begin-, end-, and half-reaction curves are justextensions of those for the pearlitic transformation, as shown in Figure 10.18, theisothermal transformation diagram for an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composi-tion that has been extended to lower temperatures. All three curves are C-shapedand have a “nose” at point N, where the rate of transformation is a maximum. As may be noted, whereas pearlite forms above the nose [i.e., over the temperaturerange of about 540 to (1000 to F)], at temperatures between about 215and (420 and F), bainite is the transformation product. It should also be noted that pearlitic and bainitic transformations are really competitive with each other, and once some portion of an alloy has transformedto either pearlite or bainite, transformation to the other microconstituent is notpossible without reheating to form austenite. Spheroidite If a steel alloy having either pearlitic or bainitic microstructures is heated to,and left at, a temperature below the eutectoid for a sufficiently long period oftime—for example, at about ( ) for between 18 and 24 h—yet another microstructure will form. It is called spheroidite (Figure 10.19).

Martensite is a nonequilibrium single-phase structure that results from a diffusionless transformation of austenite. It may be thoughtof as a transformation product that is competitive with pearlite and bainite. Themartensitic transformation occurs when the quenching rate is rapid enough to preventcarbon diffusion. Any diffusion whatsoever will result in the formation of ferriteand cementite phases. The martensitic transformation is not well understood. However, large num- bers of atoms experience cooperative movements, in that there is only a slight dis-placement of each atom relative to its neighbors. This occurs in such a way thatthe FCC austenite experiences a polymorphic transformation to a body-centeredtetragonal (BCT) martensite. A unit cell of this crystal structure (Figure 10.20) issimply a body-centered cube that has been elongated along one of its dimensions;this structure is distinctly different from that for BCC ferrite.

BCC ferrite. All the carbon atomsremain as interstitial impurities in martensite; as such, they constitute a supersatu-rated solid solution that is capable of rapidly transforming to other structures ifheated to temperatures at which diffusion rates become appreciable. Many steels,however, retain their martensitic structure almost indefinitely at room temperature. The martensitic transformation is not, however, unique to iron–carbon alloys. It is found in other systems and is characterized, in part, by the diffusionless trans-formation. Since the martensitic transformation does not involve diffusion, it occurs almost instantaneously; the martensite grains nucleate and grow at a very rapid rate—thevelocity of sound within the austenite matrix. Thus the martensitic transformationrate, for all practical purposes, is time independent. Martensite grains take on a plate-like or needle-like appearance, as indicated in Figure 10.21. The white phase in the micrograph is austenite (retained austenite)that did not transform during the rapid quench. As already mentioned, martensiteas well as other microconstituents (e.g., pearlite) can coexist. Being a nonequilibrium phase, martensite does not appear on the iron–iron car- bide phase diagram (Figure 9.24).The austenite-to-martensite transformation is, how-ever, represented on the isothermal transformation diagram. Since the martensitictransformation is diffusionless and instantaneous, it is not depicted in this diagramas the pearlitic and bainitic reactions are. The beginning of this transformation isrepresented by a horizontal line designated M(start) (Figure 10.22). Two other hor- izontal and dashed lines, labeled M(50%) and M(90%), indicate percentages of the austenite-to-martensite transformation. The temperatures at which these lines are10.5 Isothermal Transformation Diagrams •331 martensite Figure 10.20 The body-centered tetragonal unit cell for martensitic steel showing iron atoms (circles) and sites that may be occupied by carbon atoms (crosses).

For thistetragonal unit cell, c7a. c aa1496T_c10_311-357 11/30/05 7:37 Page 331REVISED PAGESlocated vary with alloy composition but, nevertheless, must be relatively low because carbon diffusion must be virtually nonexistent.4The horizontal and linear character of these lines indicates that the martensitic transformation is independent of time;it is a function only of the temperature to which the alloy is quenched or rapidlycooled. A transformation of this type is termed an athermal transformation. Consider an alloy of eutectoid composition that is very rapidly cooled from a temperature above ( ) to, say, ( ). From the isothermaltransformation diagram (Figure 10.22) it may be noted that 50% of the austenitewill immediately transform to martensite; and as long as this temperature is main-tained, there will be no further transformation. The presence of alloying elements other than carbon (e.g., Cr, Ni, Mo, and W) may cause significant changes in the positions and shapes of the curves in the isother-mal transformation diagrams. These include (1) shifting to longer times the nose ofthe austenite-to-pearlite transformation (and also a proeutectoid phase nose, if suchexists), and (2) the formation of a separate bainite nose. These alterations may beobserved by comparing Figures 10.22 and 10.23, which are isothermal transforma-tion diagrams for carbon and alloy steels, respectively. Steels in which carbon is the prime alloying element are termed plain carbon steels, whereas alloy steels contain appreciable concentrations of other elements, including those cited in the preceding paragraph.

In each case the initial cooling is rapid enough to prevent any transformationfrom occurring.

Therefore, by s, as stipulated in this problem, 100% of thespecimen is bainite, and no further transformation is possible, even thoughthe final quenching line passes through the martensite region of thediagram. (b)In this case it takes about 150 s at for the bainite transformation to begin, so that at 100 s the specimen is still 100% austenite. As the speci- men is cooled through the martensite region, beginning at about , pro-gressively more of the austenite instantaneously transforms to martensite.Thistransformation is complete by the time room temperature is reached, suchthat the final microstructure is 100% martensite. (c)For the isothermal line at , pearlite begins to form after about 7 s; by the time 20 s has elapsed, only approximately 50% of the specimen has transformed to pearlite. The rapid cool to is indicated by the verticalline; during this cooling, very little, if any, remaining austenite will trans-form to either pearlite or bainite, even though the cooling line passesthrough pearlite and bainite regions of the diagram. At , we begin tim-ing at essentially zero time (as indicated in Figure 10.24); thus, by the time s have elapsed, all of the remaining 50% austenite will have completely transformed to bainite. Upon quenching to room temperature, any furthertransformation is not possible inasmuch as no austenite remains; and so thefinal microstructure at room temperature consists of 50% pearlite and 50%bainite.10 3400/H11034C400/H11034C650/H11034C215/H11034C250/H11034C104350/H11034C103(750/H11034F), 400/H11034C 1200/H11034F 650/H11034C480/H11034F 250/H11034C104660/H11034F 350/H11034C1400/H11034F 760/H11034C1496T_c10_311-357 11/30/05 7:37 Page 334REVISED PAGES10.6 Continuous Cooling Transformation Diagrams •335 Figure 10.24 Isothermal transformation diagram for an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composition and the isothermal heat treatments (a), (b), and (c) in Example Problem 10.2.Time (s)Temperature (°C) Temperature (°F) 10–111 0 1 02103104105200400800 600100012001400 Eutectoid temperatureA AP B(c) (c) (a) (b)A M(start) M(50%) M(90%) 100 0200300400500600700800 A + BP + A (b) 100% Martensite(c) 50% Pearlite 50% Bainite(a) 100% Bainite Concept Check 10.3 Make a copy of the isothermal transformation diagram for an iron-carbon alloy of eutectoid composition (Figure 10.22) and then sketch and label on this diagram atime-temperature path that will produce 100% fine pearlite.

Most heat treatments for steels involve the con-tinuous cooling of a specimen to room temperature.

For continuous cooling, the time required for a reaction to begin and end is delayed.Thus the isothermal curves are shifted to longer times and lower temperatures, asindicated in Figure 10.25 for an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composition. A plotcontaining such modified beginning and ending reaction curves is termed a continuous cooling transformation (CCT ) diagram. Some control may be main- tained over the rate of temperature change depending on the cooling environment. Two cooling curves corresponding to moderately fast and slow rates are superim-posed and labeled in Figure 10.26, again for a eutectoid steel.

The transformationstarts after a time period corresponding to the intersection of the cooling curve withthe beginning reaction curve and concludes upon crossing the completion trans-formation curve. The microstructural products for the moderately rapid and slowcooling rate curves in Figure 10.26 are fine and coarse pearlite, respectively. Normally, bainite will not form when an alloy of eutectoid composition or, for that matter, any plain carbon steel is continuously cooled to room temperature.This is because all the austenite will have transformed to pearlite by the time the bainite transformation has become possible. Thus, the region representing theaustenite–pearlite transformation terminates just below the nose (Figure 10.26) asindicated by the curve AB. For any cooling curve passing through ABin Figure 10.26, the transformation ceases at the point of intersection; with continued cooling, the un-reacted austenite begins transforming to martensite upon crossing the M(start) line.continuous cooling transformation diagram1496T_c10_311-357 11/30/05 7:37 Page 336REVISED PAGESWith regard to the representation of the martensitic transformation, the M(start), M(50%), and M(90%) lines occur at identical temperatures for both isothermal and continuous cooling transformation diagrams. This may be verified for an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composition by comparison of Figures 10.22and 10.25. For the continuous cooling of a steel alloy, there exists a critical quenching rate, which represents the minimum rate of quenching that will produce a totally marten-sitic structure. This critical cooling rate, when included on the continuous transfor-mation diagram, will just miss the nose at which the pearlite transformation begins,as illustrated in Figure 10.27. As the figure also shows, only martensite will exist forquenching rates greater than the critical; in addition, there will be a range of ratesover which both pearlite and martensite are produced.

are produced. Finally, a totally pearliticstructure develops for low cooling rates. Carbon and other alloying elements also shift the pearlite (as well as the proeu- tectoid phase) and bainite noses to longer times, thus decreasing the critical cool-ing rate. In fact, one of the reasons for alloying steels is to facilitate the formationof martensite so that totally martensitic structures can develop in relatively thickcross sections. Figure 10.28 shows the continuous cooling transformation diagramfor the same alloy steel for which the isothermal transformation diagram is pre-sented in Figure 10.23. The presence of the bainite nose accounts for the possibil-ity of formation of bainite for a continuous cooling heat treatment. Several coolingcurves superimposed on Figure 10.28 indicate the critical cooling rate, and also how10.6 Continuous Cooling Transformation Diagrams •337 Figure 10.26 Moderately rapid and slow cooling curves superimposed on a continuous cooling transformation diagram for a eutectoid iron–carbon alloy.

Interestingly enough, the critical cooling rate is diminished even by the pres- ence of carbon. In fact, iron–carbon alloys containing less than about 0.25 wt% car-bon are not normally heat treated to form martensite because quenching rates toorapid to be practical are required. Other alloying elements that are particularly ef-fective in rendering steels heat treatable are chromium, nickel, molybdenum, man-ganese, silicon, and tungsten; however, these elements must be in solid solution withthe austenite at the time of quenching.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 10.7 MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF IRON–CARBON ALLOYS We shall now discuss the mechanical behavior of iron–carbon alloys having the mi-crostructures discussed heretofore—namely, fine and coarse pearlite, spheroidite,bainite, and martensite. For all but martensite, two phases are present (i.e., ferriteand cementite), and so an opportunity is provided to explore several mechanicalproperty-microstructure relationships that exist for these alloys. Pearlite Cementite is much harder but more brittle than ferrite. Thus, increasing the fractionof in a steel alloy while holding other microstructural elements constant will re-sult in a harder and stronger material. This is demonstrated in Figure 10.29 a, in which the tensile and yield strengths as well as the Brinell hardness number are plotted asa function of the weight percent carbon (or equivalently as the percentage of for steels that are composed of fine pearlite. All three parameters increase with in-creasing carbon concentration. Inasmuch as cementite is more brittle, increasing itscontent will result in a decrease in both ductility and toughness (or impact energy).These effects are shown in Figure 10.29 bfor the same fine pearlitic steels.

pearlitic steels. The layer thickness of each of the ferrite and cementite phases in the mi- crostructure also influences the mechanical behavior of the material. Fine pearliteis harder and stronger than coarse pearlite, as demonstrated in Figure 10.30 a, which plots hardness versus the carbon concentration. The reasons for this behavior relate to phenomena that occur at the – phase boundaries. First, there is a large degree of adherence between the two phasesacross a boundary. Therefore, the strong and rigid cementite phase severely restrictsdeformation of the softer ferrite phase in the regions adjacent to the boundary; thusFe 3C aFe3C2Fe3C1496T_c10_311-357 11/30/05 7:37 Page 339REVISED PAGES340 •Chapter 10 / Phase Transformations in Metals Figure 10.29 (a) Yield strength, tensile strength, and Brinell hardness versus carbon concentration for plain carbon steels having microstructures consisting of fine pearlite.

the ferrite. The degree of this reinforcement is substantially higher in fine pearlite because of the greater phase boundary areaper unit volume of material. In addition, phase boundaries serve as barriers to dis-location motion in much the same way as grain boundaries (Section 7.8). For finepearlite there are more boundaries through which a dislocation must pass duringplastic deformation. Thus, the greater reinforcement and restriction of dislocationmotion in fine pearlite account for its greater hardness and strength. Coarse pearlite is more ductile than fine pearlite, as illustrated in Figure 10.30 b, which plots percentage reduction in area versus carbon concentration for bothmicrostructure types. This behavior results from the greater restriction to plasticdeformation of the fine pearlite. Spheroidite Other elements of the microstructure relate to the shape and distribution of thephases. In this respect, the cementite phase has distinctly different shapes andarrangements in the pearlite and spheroidite microstructures (Figures 10.15 and10.19). Alloys containing pearlitic microstructures have greater strength and hard-ness than do those with spheroidite.

This behavior is again explained in terms of reinforcement at, and impedance to, dislocation motion across the ferrite–cementite boundaries as discussed above. There is less boundary area perunit volume in spheroidite, and consequently plastic deformation is not nearly asconstrained, which gives rise to a relatively soft and weak material. In fact, of allsteel alloys, those that are softest and weakest have a spheroidite microstructure. As would be expected, spheroidized steels are extremely ductile, much more than either fine or coarse pearlite (Figure 10.30 b). In addition, they are notably tough because any crack can encounter only a very small fraction of the brittlecementite particles as it propagates through the ductile ferrite matrix. Bainite Because bainitic steels have a finer structure (i.e., smaller -ferrite and parti-cles), they are generally stronger and harder than pearlitic ones; yet they exhibit adesirable combination of strength and ductility. Figure 10.31 shows the influence oftransformation temperature on the tensile strength and hardness for an iron–carbonalloy of eutectoid composition; temperature ranges over which pearlite andbainite form (consistent with the isothermal transformation diagram for this alloy, Figure 10.18) are noted at the top of Figure 10.31.

Figure 10.31. Martensite Of the various microstructures that may be produced for a given steel alloy, marten-site is the hardest and strongest and, in addition, the most brittle; it has, in fact,negligible ductility. Its hardness is dependent on the carbon content, up to about0.6 wt% as demonstrated in Figure 10.32, which plots the hardness of martensiteand fine pearlite as a function of weight percent carbon. In contrast to pearliticsteels, strength and hardness of martensite are not thought to be related to mi-crostructure. Rather, these properties are attributed to the effectiveness of the in-terstitial carbon atoms in hindering dislocation motion (as a solid-solution effect,Section 7.9), and to the relatively few slip systems (along which dislocations move)for the BCT structure. Austenite is slightly denser than martensite, and therefore, during the phase trans- formation upon quenching, there is a net volume increase. Consequently, relativelylarge pieces that are rapidly quenched may crack as a result of internal stresses; thisbecomes a problem especially when the carbon content is greater than about 0.5 wt%.Fe 3C a342 •Chapter 10 / Phase Transformations in Metals Transformation temperature (°C)Brinell hardness number Tensile strength (MPa) 200 300 400 500 600 700 800500 0100015002000 0100200300400500600Pearlite BainiteFigure 10.31 Brinell hardness and tensile strength (at room temperature) as afunction of isothermaltransformation temperaturefor an iron–carbon alloy ofeutectoid composition, takenover the temperature rangeat which bainitic andpearlitic microstructuresform.

This tempering heat treat-ment allows, by diffusional processes, the formation of tempered martensite,according to the reaction (10.20) where the single-phase BCT martensite, which is supersaturated with carbon, trans-forms to the tempered martensite, composed of the stable ferrite and cementitephases, as indicated on the iron–iron carbide phase diagram. The microstructure of tempered martensite consists of extremely small and uni- formly dispersed cementite particles embedded within a continuous ferrite matrix.This is similar to the microstructure of spheroidite except that the cementite parti-cles are much, much smaller. An electron micrograph showing the microstructureof tempered martensite at a very high magnification is presented in Figure 10.33. Tempered martensite may be nearly as hard and strong as martensite, but with substantially enhanced ductility and toughness. For example, on the hardness-versus-weight percent carbon plot of Figure 10.32 is included a curve for temperedmartensite. The hardness and strength may be explained by the large ferrite–cementite phase boundary area per unit volume that exists for the very fine andnumerous cementite particles. Again, the hard cementite phase reinforces the fer-rite matrix along the boundaries, and these boundaries also act as barriers to dis-location motion during plastic deformation.The continuous ferrite phase is also veryductile and relatively tough, which accounts for the improvement of these two prop-erties for tempered martensite.

tempered martensite. The size of the cementite particles influences the mechanical behavior of tem- pered martensite; increasing the particle size decreases the ferrite–cementite phaseboundary area and, consequently, results in a softer and weaker material yet onethat is tougher and more ductile. Furthermore, the tempering heat treatmentdetermines the size of the cementite particles. Heat treatment variables are tem-perature and time, and most treatments are constant-temperature processes. Sincecarbon diffusion is involved in the martensite-tempered martensite transformation,increasing the temperature will accelerate diffusion, the rate of cementite particlegrowth, and, subsequently, the rate of softening.

embrittlement . The phenomenon occurs when the steel is tempered at a temperature above about ( )followed by slow cooling to room temperature, or when tempering is carried out atbetween approximately 375 and (700 and F). Steel alloys that are sus-ceptible to temper embrittlement have been found to contain appreciable concen-trations of the alloying elements manganese, nickel, or chromium and, in addition,one or more of antimony, phosphorus, arsenic, and tin as impurities in relatively lowconcentrations. The presence of these alloying elements and impurities shifts theductile-to-brittle transition to significantly higher temperatures; the ambient tem-perature thus lies below this transition in the brittle regime. It has been observedthat crack propagation of these embrittled materials is intergranular (Figure 8.7);that is, the fracture path is along the grain boundaries of the precursor austenitephase. Furthermore, alloy and impurity elements have been found to preferentiallysegregate in these regions. Temper embrittlement may be avoided by (1) compositional control, and/or (2) tempering above or below , followed by quenching to room tem-perature. Furthermore, the toughness of steels that have been embrittled maybe improved significantly by heating to about ( ) and then rapidlycooling to below ( ). 10.9 REVIEW OF PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES FOR IRON–CARBON ALLOYS In this chapter we have discussed several different microstructures that may be pro- duced in iron–carbon alloys depending on heat treatment.

(or SMAs). One of these materials, after having been deformed, hasthe ability to return to its pre-deformed size andshape upon being subjected to an appropriate heattreatment—that is, the material “remembers” itsprevious size/shape. Deformation normally is car-ried out at a relatively low temperature, whereas,shape memory occurs upon heating. 5 Materials that have been found to be capable of recoveringsignificant amounts of deformation (i.e., strain)are nickel–titanium alloys (Nitinol, 6is their trade- name), and some copper-base alloys (viz. Cu–Zn–Al and Cu–Al–Ni alloys). A shape memory alloy is polymorphic (Sec- tion 3.6)—that is, it may have two crystal struc-tures (or phases), and the shape-memory effectinvolves phase transformations between them.One phase (termed an austenite phase) has abody-centered cubic structure that exists at ele-vated temperatures; its structure is representedschematically by the inset shown at stage 1 ofFigure 10.37. Upon cooling, the austenite trans-forms spontaneously to a martensite phase, whichis similar to the martensitic transformation for theiron–carbon system (Section 10.5)—that is, it is dif-fusionless, involves an orderly shift of large groupsof atoms, occurs very rapidly, and the degree oftransformation is dependent on temperature; tem-peratures at which the transformation begins andends are indicated by “ ” and “ ” labels on theleft vertical axis of Figure 10.37. In addition, thismartensite is heavily twinned, 7as represented schematically by the stage 2 inset, Figure 10.37.Under the influence of an applied stress, defor-mation of martensite (i.e., the passage from stage2 to stage 3, Figure 10.37) occurs by the migrationof twin boundaries—some twinned regions growwhile others shrink; this deformed martensiticM f Msstructure is represented by the stage 3 inset.

3 inset. Fur-thermore, when the stress is removed, the de-formed shape is retained at this temperature.And, finally, upon subsequent heating to the ini-tial temperature, the material reverts back to (i.e.,“remembers”) its original size and shape (stage 4).This stage 3–stage 4 process is accompaniedby a phase transformation from the deformedmartensite to the original high-temperatureaustenite phase. For these shape memory alloys, the martensite-to-austenite transformation occurs over a temperature range , between temperatures denoted by “ ” (austenite start) and “ A f”(austen- ite finish) labels on the right vertical axis ofAs 5Alloys that demonstrate this phenomenon only upon heating are said to have a one-way shape memory. Some of these materials experience size/shape changes on both heating and cooling; these are termed two-way shape memory alloys. In this discussion, we discuss the mechanism for only the one-way shape-memory. 6“Nitinol” is really an acronym for nickel-titanium Naval Ordnance Laboratory, where this alloy was discovered. 7The phenomenon of twinning is described in Section 7.7. Time-lapse photograph that demonstrates the shape- memory effect. A wire of a shape-memory alloy(Nitinol) has been bent and treated such that itsmemory shape spells the word “Nitinol”. The wire isthen deformed and, upon heating (by passage of anelectric current), springs back to its pre-deformedshape; this shape recovery process is recorded on thephotograph.

Of course, this deformation–trans- formation cycle may be repeated for the shape-memory material. The original shape (to be remembered) is cre- ated by heating to well above the temperature(such that the transformation to austenite is com-plete), and then restraining the material to the de-sired memory shape for a sufficient time period.For example, for Nitinol alloys, a one-hour treat-ment at is necessary. Although the deformation experienced by shape-memory alloys is semipermanent, it is nottruly “plastic” deformation, as discussed in Sec-tion 6.6—neither is it strictly “elastic”(Section 6.3).Rather, it is termed “thermoelastic,” since defor-mation is nonpermanent when the deformedmaterial is subsequently heat treated. The stress-versus-strain behavior of a thermoelastic materialis presented in Figure 10.38. Maximum recover-able deformation strains for these materials are onthe order of 8%. For this Nitinol family of alloys, transforma- tion temperatures can be made to vary over a widetemperature range (between about and ), by altering the Ni–Ti ratio, and also by the addition of other elements. One important SMA application is in weldless, shrink-to-fit pipe couplers used for hydraulic lineson aircraft, for joints on undersea pipelines, and forplumbing on ships and submarines.

and submarines. Each coupler(in the form of a cylindrical sleeve) is fabricated soas to have an inside diameter slightly smaller thanthe outside diameter of the pipes to be joined. Itis then stretched (circumferentially) at some tem-perature well below the ambient. Next the coupleris fitted over the pipe junction, and then heated toroom temperature; heating causes the coupler toshrink back to its original diameter, thus creatinga tight seal between the two pipe sections.110/H11034C/H11002200/H11034C500/H11034CA f There is a host of other applications for alloys displaying this effect—for example, eyeglass frames, tooth-straightening braces, collapsible an-tennas, greenhouse window openers, antiscaldcontrol valves on showers, women’s foundations,fire sprinkler valves, and in biomedical applica-tions (as blood-clot filters, self-extending coronarystents, and bone anchors).

Nucleation and growth processes, which are involvedin the production of a new phase, were discussed, in addition to the temperature1496T_c10_311-357 11/30/05 7:37 Page 350REVISED PAGESImportant Terms and Concepts •351 dependence of phase transformation rate. Other kinetic principles were treated, including, for solid-state transformations, the dependence of fraction of transfor-mation on time. Metastable Versus Equilibrium StatesIsothermal Transformation DiagramsContinuous Cooling Transformation DiagramsMechanical Behavior of Iron–Carbon AlloysTempered Martensite As a practical matter, phase diagrams are severely restricted relative to trans- formations in multiphase alloys, because they provide no information as to phasetransformation rates. The element of time is incorporated into both isothermaltransformation and continuous cooling transformation diagrams; transformationprogress as a function of temperature and elapsed time is expressed for a specificalloy at constant temperature and for continuous cooling treatments, respectively.Diagrams of both types were presented for iron–carbon steel alloys, and their util-ity with regard to the prediction of microstructural products was discussed. Several microconstituents are possible for steels, the formation of which de- pends on composition and heat treatment.These microconstituents include fine andcoarse pearlite, and bainite, which are composed of ferrite and cementite phasesand result from the decomposition of austenite via diffusional processes. A spher-oidite microstructure (also consisting of ferrite and cementite phases) may be pro-duced when a steel specimen composed of any of the preceding microstructures isheat treated at a temperature just below the eutectoid.

the eutectoid. The mechanical character-istics of pearlitic, bainitic, and spheroiditic steels were compared and also explainedin terms of their microconstituents. Martensite, yet another transformation product in steels, results when austen- ite is cooled very rapidly. It is a metastable and single-phase structure that may beproduced in steels by a diffusionless and almost instantaneous transformation ofaustenite. Transformation progress is dependent on temperature rather than time,and may be represented on both isothermal and continuous cooling transformationdiagrams. Furthermore, alloying element additions retard the formation rate ofpearlite and bainite, thus rendering the martensitic transformation more competi-tive. Mechanically, martensite is extremely hard; applicability, however, is limited byits brittleness. A tempering heat treatment increases the ductility at some sacrificeof strength and hardness. During tempering, martensite transforms to temperedmartensite, which consists of the equilibrium ferrite and cementite phases. Embrit-tlement of some steel alloys results when specific alloying and impurity elementsare present, and upon tempering within a definite temperature range.

Therefore, the people whoare involved in the decision making should have some knowledge of the availableoptions. The first portion of this chapter provides an abbreviated overview of someof the commercial alloys, their general properties, and limitations.

and limitations. Materials selection decisions may also be influenced by the ease with which metal alloys may be formed or manufactured into useful components. Alloy prop-erties are altered by fabrication processes, and, in addition, further property al-terations may be induced by the employment of appropriate heat treatments.Therefore, in the latter sections of this chapter we consider the details of some ofthese treatments, including annealing procedures, the heat treating of steels, andprecipitation hardening. Types of Metal Alloys Metal alloys, by virtue of composition, are often grouped into two classes—ferrousand nonferrous. Ferrous alloys, those in which iron is the principal constituent, in-clude steels and cast irons. These alloys and their characteristics are the first topicsof discussion of this section. The nonferrous ones—all alloys that are not ironbased—are treated next. 11.2 FERROUS ALLOYS Ferrous alloys—those of which iron is the prime constituent—are produced in largerquantities than any other metal type. They are especially important as engineeringconstruction materials. Their widespread use is accounted for by three factors:(1) iron-containing compounds exist in abundant quantities within the earth’s crust;(2) metallic iron and steel alloys may be produced using relatively economicalextraction, refining, alloying, and fabrication techniques; and (3) ferrous alloys areLearning Objectives After careful study of this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1.Name four different types of steels and, foreach, cite compositional differences, distinctiveproperties, and typical uses. 2.Name the five cast iron types and, for each,describe its microstructure and note its generalmechanical characteristics. 3.Name seven different types of nonferrousalloys and, for each, cite its distinctive physicaland mechanical characteristics.

The principal disadvantage of many ferrous alloys istheir susceptibility to corrosion.This section discusses compositions, microstructures,and properties of a number of different classes of steels and cast irons. A taxonomicclassification scheme for the various ferrous alloys is presented in Figure 11.1. Steels Steels are iron–carbon alloys that may contain appreciable concentrations of otheralloying elements; there are thousands of alloys that have different compositionsand/or heat treatments. The mechanical properties are sensitive to the content ofcarbon, which is normally less than 1.0 wt%. Some of the more common steels areclassified according to carbon concentration—namely, into low-, medium-, and high-carbon types.

high-carbon types. Subclasses also exist within each group according to the concentrationof other alloying elements. Plain carbon steels contain only residual concentrations of impurities other than carbon and a little manganese. For alloy steels, more alloying elements are intentionally added in specific concentrations. Low-Carbon Steels Of all the different steels, those produced in the greatest quantities fall within thelow-carbon classification. These generally contain less than about 0.25 wt% C andare unresponsive to heat treatments intended to form martensite; strengthening is ac-complished by cold work. Microstructures consist of ferrite and pearlite constituents.360 •Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys Figure 11.1 Classification scheme for the various ferrous alloys.Metal alloys Nonferrous Ferrous Steels Low alloy Low-carbon Plain High strength, low alloyPlain Heat treatablePlain Tool StainlessMedium-carbon High-carbonHigh alloyGray ironDuctile (nodular) ironWhite ironMalleable ironCompacted graphite ironCast irons plain carbon steel alloy steel1496T_c11_358-413 11/30/05 18:58 Page 360REVISED PAGESAs a consequence, these alloys are relatively soft and weak but have outstanding ductility and toughness; in addition, they are machinable, weldable, and, of all steels,are the least expensive to produce. Typical applications include automobile bodycomponents, structural shapes (I-beams, channel and angle iron), and sheets that areused in pipelines, buildings, bridges, and tin cans.

Another group of low-carbon alloys are the high-strength, low-alloy (HSLA) steels.

(HSLA) steels. They contain other alloying elements such as copper, vanadium, nickel, and molybdenum in combined concentrations as high as 10 wt%, and possess higherstrengths than the plain low-carbon steels. Most may be strengthened by heat treat-ment, giving tensile strengths in excess of 480 MPa (70,000 psi); in addition, they areductile, formable, and machinable. Several are listed in Table 11.1. In normal atmo-spheres, the HSLA steels are more resistant to corrosion than the plain carbon steels,which they have replaced in many applications where structural strength is critical(e.g., bridges, towers, support columns in high-rise buildings, and pressure vessels). Medium-Carbon Steels The medium-carbon steels have carbon concentrations between about 0.25 and0.60 wt%. These alloys may be heat treated by austenitizing, quenching, and thentempering to improve their mechanical properties.They are most often utilized in thetempered condition, having microstructures of tempered martensite. The plainmedium-carbon steels have low hardenabilities (Section 11.8) and can be successfullyheat treated only in very thin sections and with very rapid quenching rates. Addi-tions of chromium, nickel, and molybdenum improve the capacity of these alloys tobe heat treated (Section 11.8), giving rise to a variety of strength–ductility combi-nations. These heat-treated alloys are stronger than the low-carbon steels, but at asacrifice of ductility and toughness. Applications include railway wheels and tracks,gears, crankshafts, and other machine parts and high-strength structural componentscalling for a combination of high strength, wear resistance, and toughness. The compositions of several of these alloyed medium-carbon steels are pre- sented in Table 11.2a.

Table 11.2a. Some comment is in order regarding the designation schemesthat are also included. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), the AmericanIron and Steel Institute (AISI), and the American Society for Testing and Materi-als (ASTM) are responsible for the classification and specification of steels as wellas other alloys. The AISI/SAE designation for these steels is a four-digit number:the first two digits indicate the alloy content; the last two give the carbon concen-tration. For plain carbon steels, the first two digits are 1 and 0; alloy steels are des-ignated by other initial two-digit combinations (e.g., 13, 41, 43). The third and fourthdigits represent the weight percent carbon multiplied by 100. For example, a 1060steel is a plain carbon steel containing 0.60 wt% C. A unified numbering system (UNS) is used for uniformly indexing both fer- rous and nonferrous alloys. Each UNS number consists of a single-letter prefix fol-lowed by a five-digit number.The letter is indicative of the family of metals to whichan alloy belongs. The UNS designation for these alloys begins with a G, followedby the AISI/SAE number; the fifth digit is a zero. Table 11.2b contains the me-chanical characteristics and typical applications of several of these steels, which havebeen quenched and tempered. High-Carbon Steels The high-carbon steels, normally having carbon contents between 0.60 and 1.4 wt%,are the hardest, strongest, and yet least ductile of the carbon steels. They are almostalways used in a hardened and tempered condition and, as such, are especially wearresistant and capable of holding a sharp cutting edge. The tool and die steels arehigh-carbon alloys, usually containing chromium, vanadium, tungsten, and molyb-denum.

and molyb-denum. These alloying elements combine with carbon to form very hard and362 •Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys high-strength, low-alloy steel1496T_c11_358-413 11/30/05 18:58 Page 362REVISED PAGES11.2 Ferrous Alloys •363 Table 11.2a AISI/SAE and UNS Designation Systems and Composition Ranges for Plain Carbon Steel and Various Low-Alloy Steels Composition Ranges AISI/SAE UNS(wt% of Alloying Elements in Addition to C )b DesignationaDesignation Ni Cr Mo Other 10xx, Plain carbon G10xx0 11xx, Free machining G11xx0 0.08–0.33S 12xx, Free machining G12xx0 0.10–0.35S, 0.04–0.12P 13xx G13xx0 1.60–1.90Mn 40xx G40xx0 0.20–0.30 41xx G41xx0 0.80–1.10 0.15–0.25 43xx G43xx0 1.65–2.00 0.40–0.90 0.20–0.30 46xx G46xx0 0.70–2.00 0.15–0.30 48xx G48xx0 3.25–3.75 0.20–0.30 51xx G51xx0 0.70–1.10 61xx G61xx0 0.50–1.10 0.10–0.15V 86xx G86xx0 0.40–0.70 0.40–0.60 0.15–0.25 92xx G92xx0 1.80–2.20Si a The carbon concentration, in weight percent times 100, is inserted in the place of “xx” for each specific steel.

These steels are utilized as cutting tools and dies for forming and shaping materials, as well as in knives,razors, hacksaw blades, springs, and high-strength wire. Stainless Steels The stainless steels are highly resistant to corrosion (rusting) in a variety of envi- ronments, especially the ambient atmosphere. Their predominant alloying elementis chromium; a concentration of at least 11 wt% Cr is required. Corrosion resis-tance may also be enhanced by nickel and molybdenum additions. Stainless steels are divided into three classes on the basis of the predominant phase constituent of the microstructure—martensitic, ferritic, or austenitic.Table 11.4lists several stainless steels, by class, along with composition, typical mechanicalproperties, and applications. A wide range of mechanical properties combinedwith excellent resistance to corrosion make stainless steels very versatile in theirapplicability. Martensitic stainless steels are capable of being heat treated in such a way that martensite is the prime microconstituent. Additions of alloying elements in signif-icant concentrations produce dramatic alterations in the iron–iron carbide phasediagram (Figure 9.24). For austenitic stainless steels, the austenite (or ) phase fieldis extended to room temperature. Ferritic stainless steels are composed of the fer-rite (BCC) phase. Austenitic and ferritic stainless steels are hardened and strength-ened by cold work because they are not heat treatable.The austenitic stainless steelsare the most corrosion resistant because of the high chromium contents and alsothe nickel additions; and they are produced in the largest quantities. Both martensiticand ferritic stainless steels are magnetic; the austenitic stainlesses are not. Some stainless steels are frequently used at elevated temperatures and in severe environments because they resist oxidation and maintain their mechani-cal integrity under such conditions; the upper temperature limit in oxidizingag364 •Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys Table 11.3 Designations, Compositions, and Applications for Six Tool Steels AISI UNSComposition (wt%)a Number Number C Cr Ni Mo W V Typical Applications M1 T11301 0.85 3.75 0.30 max 8.70 1.75 1.20 Drills, saws; lathe and planer tools A2 T30102 1.00 5.15 0.30 max 1.15 — 0.35 Punches, embossing dies D2 T30402 1.50 12 0.30 max 0.95 — 1.10 max Cutlery, drawing dies O1 T31501 0.95 0.50 0.30 max — 0.50 0.30 max Shear blades, cutting tools S1 T41901 0.50 1.40 0.30 max 0.50 max 2.25 0.25 Pipe cutters, concrete drills W1 T72301 1.10 0.15 max 0.20 max 0.10 max 0.15 max 0.10 max Blacksmith tools, woodworking tools aThe balance of the composition is iron.

Hint: you may want to consult the first portion of Section 11.3. [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Cast Irons Generically, cast irons are a class of ferrous alloys with carbon contents above 2.14 wt%; in practice, however, most cast irons contain between 3.0 and 4.5 wt% Cand, in addition, other alloying elements. A reexamination of the iron–iron carbidephase diagram (Figure 9.24) reveals that alloys within this composition range be-come completely liquid at temperatures between approximately 1150 and (2100 and ), which is considerably lower than for steels. Thus, they are eas-ily melted and amenable to casting. Furthermore, some cast irons are very brittle,and casting is the most convenient fabrication technique. Cementite (Fe 3C) is a metastable compound, and under some circumstances it can be made to dissociate or decompose to form ferrite and graphite, accordingto the reaction (11.1) Thus, the true equilibrium diagram for iron and carbon is not that presented in Figure 9.24, but rather as shown in Figure 11.2. The two diagrams are virtually iden-tical on the iron-rich side (e.g., eutectic and eutectoid temperatures for the Fe–Fe 3C system are 1147 and respectively, as compared to 1153 and for Fe–C);however, Figure 11.2 extends to 100 wt% carbon such that graphite is the carbon-rich phase, instead of cementite at 6.7 wt% C (Figure 9.24).740/H11034C 727/H11034C,Fe 3CS3Fe 1a2/H11001C 1graphite 2a2350/H11034F1300/H11034C366 •Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys cast iron Decomposition of iron carbide to form ferrite and graphitea 2.1 wt% C Temperature (°F)Temperature (°C) Composition (wt% C)Composition (at% C) 1600 1200 10002500 2000 1500 1000800 600 400012340 5 10 15 98 90 100 GraphiteLiquid Liquid + Graphite 1153°C 4.2 wt% C 740°C 0.65 wt% C/H9253(Austenite) /H9253+ Graphite /H9251+ Graphite/H9251(Ferrite)/H9253+ L1400Figure 11.2 The true equilibrium iron–carbon phase diagram with graphite instead of cementite as a stable phase.

Graphite formation is promoted by the presence of silicon in concentrations greater than about 1 wt%. Also, slower cooling rates during solidification favorgraphitization (the formation of graphite). For most cast irons, the carbon exists asgraphite, and both microstructure and mechanical behavior depend on compositionand heat treatment. The most common cast iron types are gray, nodular, white,malleable, and compacted graphite. Gray Iron The carbon and silicon contents of gray cast irons vary between 2.5 and 4.0 wt% and 1.0 and 3.0 wt%, respectively. For most of these cast irons, the graphite existsin the form of flakes (similar to corn flakes), which are normally surrounded by an -ferrite or pearlite matrix; the microstructure of a typical gray iron is shown in Figure 11.3a. Because of these graphite flakes, a fractured surface takes on a grayappearance, hence its name. Mechanically, gray iron is comparatively weak and brittle in tension as a con- sequence of its microstructure; the tips of the graphite flakes are sharp and pointed,and may serve as points of stress concentration when an external tensile stress isapplied. Strength and ductility are much higher under compressive loads.

Theresulting alloy is called nodular or ductile iron, and a typical microstructure is shown in Figure 11.3b. The matrix phase surrounding these particles is either pearlite orferrite, depending on heat treatment (Figure 11.5); it is normally pearlite for an as- cast piece. However, a heat treatment for several hours at about ( ) will yield a ferrite matrix as in this photomicrograph. Castings are stronger and much moreductile than gray iron, as a comparison of their mechanical properties in Table 11.5shows. In fact, ductile iron has mechanical characteristics approaching those of steel.For example, ferritic ductile irons have tensile strengths ranging between 380 and480 MPa (55,000 and 70,000 psi), and ductilities (as percent elongation) from 10%to 20%. Typical applications for this material include valves, pump bodies, crank-shafts, gears, and other automotive and machine components. White Iron and Malleable Iron For low-silicon cast irons (containing less than 1.0 wt% Si) and rapid cooling rates,most of the carbon exists as cementite instead of graphite, as indicated in Figure 11.5.A fracture surface of this alloy has a white appearance, and thus it is termed white cast iron.

cast iron. An optical photomicrograph showing the microstructure of white iron is presented in Figure 11.3 c. Thick sections may have only a surface layer of white iron that was “chilled” during the casting process; gray iron forms at interior re-gions, which cool more slowly. As a consequence of large amounts of the cementitephase, white iron is extremely hard but also very brittle, to the point of being vir-tually unmachinable. Its use is limited to applications that necessitate a very hardand wear-resistant surface, without a high degree of ductility—for example, as rollersin rolling mills. Generally, white iron is used as an intermediary in the productionof yet another cast iron, malleable iron. Heating white iron at temperatures between 800 and (1470 and ) for a prolonged time period and in a neutral atmosphere (to prevent oxidation)causes a decomposition of the cementite, forming graphite, which exists in the formof clusters or rosettes surrounded by a ferrite or pearlite matrix, depending on cool-ing rate, as indicated in Figure 11.5. A photomicrograph of a ferritic malleable ironis presented in Figure 11.3 d. The microstructure is similar to that for nodular iron (Figure 11.3 b), which accounts for relatively high strength and appreciable ductility or malleability. Some typical mechanical characteristics are also listed in Table 11.5.Representative applications include connecting rods, transmission gears, and differ-ential cases for the automotive industry, and also flanges, pipe fittings, and valve partsfor railroad, marine, and other heavy-duty services. Gray and ductile cast irons are produced in approximately the same amounts; however, white and malleable cast irons are produced in smaller quantities. Concept Check 1 1.2 It is possible to produce cast irons that consist of a martensite matrix in whichgraphite is embedded in either flake, nodule, or rosette form.

As with gray, ductile, and malleable irons, carbon exists as graphite, which formation is promoted by the presence of silicon. Silicon content ranges between 1.7 and 3.0 wt%, whereas carbon concentration is normally between3.1 and 4.0 wt%. Two CGI materials are included in Table 11.5. Microstructurally, the graphite in CGI alloys has a worm-like (or vermicular) shape; a typical CGI microstructure is shown in the optical micrograph of Figure 11.3e. In a sense, this microstructure is intermediate between that of gray iron (Figure 11.3a)and ductile (nodular) iron (Figure 11.3 b), and, in fact, some of the graphite (less than 20%) may be as nodules. However, sharp edges (characteristic of graphiteflakes) should be avoided; the presence of this feature leads to a reduction in frac-ture and fatigue resistance of the material. Magnesium and/or cerium is also added,but concentrations are lower than for ductile iron.The chemistries of CGIs are morecomplex than for the other cast iron types; compositions of magnesium, cerium, andother additives must be controlled so as to produce a microstructure that consistsof the worm-like graphite particles, while at the same time limiting the degree ofgraphite nodularity, and preventing the formation of graphite flakes.

graphite flakes. Furthermore,depending on heat treatment, the matrix phase will be pearlite and/or ferrite. As with the other types of cast irons, the mechanical properties of CGIs are re- lated to microstructure: graphite particle shape as well as the matrix phase/micro-constituent. An increase in degree of nodularity of the graphite particles leads toenhancements of both strength and ductility. Furthermore, CGIs with ferritic ma-trices have lower strengths and higher ductilies than those with pearlitic matrices.Tensile and yield strengths for compacted graphite irons are comparable to valuesfor ductile and malleable irons, yet are greater than those observed for the higher-strength gray irons (Table 11.5). In addition, ductilities for CGIs are intermediatebetween values for gray and ductile irons; also, moduli of elasticity range between140 and 165 GPa ( and psi). Compared to the other cast iron types, desirable characteristics of CGIs include the following: Higher thermal conductivity Better resistance to thermal shock (i.e., fracture resulting from rapid tempera- ture changes) Lower oxidation at elevated temperatures Compacted graphite irons are now being used in a number of important applications—these include: diesel engine blocks, exhaust manifolds, gearbox hous- ings, brake discs for high-speed trains, and flywheels. 11.3 NONFERROUS ALLOYS Steel and other ferrous alloys are consumed in exceedingly large quantities becausethey have such a wide range of mechanical properties, may be fabricated with rel ative ease, and are economical to produce. However, they have some distinct limitations,chiefly: (1) a relatively high density, (2) a comparatively low electrical conductivity,and (3) an inherent susceptibility to corrosion in some common environments.Thus,for many applications it is advantageous or even necessary to utilize other alloyshaving more suitable property combinations.

property combinations. Alloy systems are classified eitheraccording to the base metal or according to some specific characteristic that a groupof alloys share. This section discusses the following metal and alloy systems: copper,24/H1100310 620/H11003106372 •Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys compacted graphite iron1496T_c11_358-413 11/30/05 18:59 Page 372REVISED PAGESaluminum, magnesium, and titanium alloys, the refractory metals, the superalloys, the noble metals, and miscellaneous alloys, including those that have nickel, lead,tin, zirconium, and zinc as base metals. On occasion, a distinction is made between cast and wrought alloys. Alloys that are so brittle that forming or shaping by appreciable deformation is not possibleordinarily are cast; these are classified as cast alloys. On the other hand, those that are amenable to mechanical deformation are termed wrought alloys. In addition, the heat treatability of an alloy system is mentioned frequently. “Heat treatable” designates an alloy whose mechanical strength is improved by pre-cipitation hardening (Section 11.9) or a martensitic transformation (normally theformer), both of which involve specific heat-treating procedures. Copper and Its Alloys Copper and copper-based alloys, possessing a desirable combination of physicalproperties, have been utilized in quite a variety of applications since antiquity.Unalloyed copper is so soft and ductile that it is difficult to machine; also, it hasan almost unlimited capacity to be cold worked. Furthermore, it is highly resis-tant to corrosion in diverse environments including the ambient atmosphere, sea-water, and some industrial chemicals. The mechanical and corrosion-resistanceproperties of copper may be improved by alloying. Most copper alloys cannot behardened or strengthened by heat-treating procedures; consequently, cold work-ing and/or solid-solution alloying must be utilized to improve these mechanicalproperties.

these mechanicalproperties. The most common copper alloys are the brasses for which zinc, as a substitu- tional impurity, is the predominant alloying element. As may be observed for thecopper–zinc phase diagram (Figure 9.19), the phase is stable for concentrationsup to approximately 35 wt% Zn. This phase has an FCC crystal structure, and brasses are relatively soft, ductile, and easily cold worked. Brass alloys having ahigher zinc content contain both and phases at room temperature.The phasehas an ordered BCC crystal structure and is harder and stronger than the phase;consequently, alloys are generally hot worked. Some of the common brasses are yellow, naval, and cartridge brass, muntz metal, and gilding metal. The compositions, properties, and typical uses of several of thesealloys are listed in Table 11.6. Some of the common uses for brass alloys includecostume jewelry, cartridge casings, automotive radiators, musical instruments, elec-tronic packaging, and coins. The bronzes are alloys of copper and several other elements, including tin, alu- minum, silicon, and nickel. These alloys are somewhat stronger than the brasses, yetthey still have a high degree of corrosion resistance. Table 11.6 contains several ofthe bronze alloys, their compositions, properties, and applications. Generally theyare utilized when, in addition to corrosion resistance, good tensile properties arerequired. The most common heat-treatable copper alloys are the beryllium coppers. They possess a remarkable combination of properties: tensile strengths as high as1400 MPa (200,000 psi), excellent electrical and corrosion properties, and wear re-sistance when properly lubricated; they may be cast, hot worked, or cold worked. Highstrengths are attained by precipitation-hardening heat treatments (Section 11.9).These alloys are costly because of the beryllium additions, which range between1.0 and 2.5 wt%.

2.5 wt%. Applications include jet aircraft landing gear bearings and bush-ings, springs, and surgical and dental instruments.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Aluminum and Its Alloys Aluminum and its alloys are characterized by a relatively low density (2.7 g/cm3 as compared to 7.9 g/cm3for steel), high electrical and thermal conductivities, and a resistance to corrosion in some common environments, including the ambient1496T_c11_358-413 11/30/05 18:59 Page 374REVISED PAGESatmosphere. Many of these alloys are easily formed by virtue of high ductility; this is evidenced by the thin aluminum foil sheet into which the relatively pure mate-rial may be rolled. Since aluminum has an FCC crystal structure, its ductility is re-tained even at very low temperatures. The chief limitation of aluminum is its lowmelting temperature [ ( )], which restricts the maximum temperature atwhich it can be used. The mechanical strength of aluminum may be enhanced by cold work and by alloying; however, both processes tend to diminish resistance to corrosion. Princi-pal alloying elements include copper, magnesium, silicon, manganese, and zinc.Nonheat-treatable alloys consist of a single phase, for which an increase in strengthis achieved by solid-solution strengthening. Others are rendered heat treatable (ca-pable of being precipitation hardened) as a result of alloying. In several of thesealloys precipitation hardening is due to the precipitation of two elements other thanaluminum, to form an intermetallic compound such as MgZn Generally, aluminum alloys are classified as either cast or wrought.

or wrought. Composi- tion for both types is designated by a four-digit number that indicates the princi-pal impurities, and in some cases, the purity level. For cast alloys, a decimal pointis located between the last two digits. After these digits is a hyphen and the basictemper designation—a letter and possibly a one- to three-digit number, whichindicates the mechanical and/or heat treatment to which the alloy has been sub-jected. For example, F, H, and O represent, respectively, the as-fabricated, strain-hardened, and annealed states; T3 means that the alloy was solution heat treated,cold worked, and then naturally aged (age hardened). A solution heat treatmentfollowed by artificial aging is indicated by T6. The compositions, properties, andapplications of several wrought and cast alloys are contained in Table 11.7. Someof the more common applications of aluminum alloys include aircraft structuralparts, beverage cans, bus bodies, and automotive parts (engine blocks, pistons, andmanifolds). Recent attention has been given to alloys of aluminum and other low-density metals (e.g., Mg and Ti) as engineering materials for transportation, to effect re-ductions in fuel consumption. An important characteristic of these materials isspecific strength, which is quantified by the tensile strength–specific gravity ratio. Even though an alloy of one of these metals may have a tensile strength that is in-ferior to a more dense material (such as steel), on a weight basis it will be able tosustain a larger load. A generation of new aluminum–lithium alloys have been developed recently for use by the aircraft and aerospace industries. These materials have relatively lowdensities (between about 2.5 and 2.6 g/cm 3), high specific moduli (elastic modulus- specific gravity ratios), and excellent fatigue and low-temperature toughness prop-erties.

toughness prop-erties. Furthermore, some of them may be precipitation hardened. However, thesematerials are more costly to manufacture than the conventional aluminum alloysbecause special processing techniques are required as a result of lithium’s chemi-cal reactivity.

At room temperature magnesium and its alloys are difficult to de-form; in fact, only small degrees of cold work may be imposed without annealing.Consequently, most fabrication is by casting or hot working at temperaturesbetween 200 and (400 and ). Magnesium, like aluminum, has a moder-ately low melting temperature [ ( )]. Chemically, magnesium alloys arerelatively unstable and especially susceptible to corrosion in marine environments.On the other hand, corrosion or oxidation resistance is reasonably good in the nor-mal atmosphere; it is believed that this behavior is due to impurities rather thanbeing an inherent characteristic of Mg alloys. Fine magnesium powder ignites eas-ily when heated in air; consequently, care should be exercised when handling it inthis state. These alloys are also classified as either cast or wrought, and some of them are heat treatable. Aluminum, zinc, manganese, and some of the rare earths are the ma-jor alloying elements. A composition–temper designation scheme similar to that foraluminum alloys is also used. Table 11.8 lists several common magnesium alloys,their compositions, properties, and applications.These alloys are used in aircraft andmissile applications, as well as in luggage.

in luggage. Furthermore, in the last several years thedemand for magnesium alloys has increased dramatically in a host of different in-dustries. For many applications, magnesium alloys have replaced engineering plas-tics that have comparable densities inasmuch as the magnesium materials are stiffer,more recyclable, and less costly to produce. For example, magnesium is now em-ployed in a variety of hand-held devices (e.g., chain saws, power tools, hedge clip-pers), in automobiles (e.g., steering wheels and columns, seat frames, transmissioncases), and in audio-video-computer-communications equipment (e.g., laptop com-puters, camcorders, TV sets, cellular telephones).

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Titanium and Its Alloys Titanium and its alloys are relatively new engineering materials that possess anextraordinary combination of properties. The pure metal has a relatively low den-sity (4.5 g/cm 3), a high melting point [ ], and an elastic modulus of 107 GPa ( psi). Titanium alloys are extremely strong; room temperaturetensile strengths as high as 1400 MPa (200,000 psi) are attainable, yielding remark-able specific strengths. Furthermore, the alloys are highly ductile and easily forgedand machined. The major limitation of titanium is its chemical reactivity with other materi- als at elevated temperatures. This property has necessitated the development of15.5 /H1100310 61668/H11034C (3035/H11034F)1204/H11034F 651/H11034C650/H11034F 350/H11034C6.5/H1100310611.3 Nonferrous Alloys •3771496T_c11_358-413 11/30/05 18:59 Page 377REVISED PAGESnonconventional refining, melting, and casting techniques; consequently, titanium alloys are quite expensive.

quite expensive. In spite of this high temperature reactivity, the corro-sion resistance of titanium alloys at normal temperatures is unusually high; theyare virtually immune to air, marine, and a variety of industrial environments.Table 11.9 presents several titanium alloys along with their typical properties and applications. They are commonly utilized in airplane structures, space vehicles,surgical implants, and in the petroleum and chemical industries. The Refractory Metals Metals that have extremely high melting temperatures are classified as the re-fractory metals. Included in this group are niobium (Nb), molybdenum (Mo), tung-sten (W), and tantalum (Ta). Melting temperatures range between ( )for niobium and ( ), the highest melting temperature of any metal,for tungsten. Interatomic bonding in these metals is extremely strong, which ac-counts for the melting temperatures, and, in addition, large elastic moduli andhigh strengths and hardnesses, at ambient as well as elevated temperatures.

Handbook, Vol. 2, Properties and Selection: Nonferrous Alloys and Special-Purpose Materials, 1990. Reprinted by permission of ASM International, Materials Park, OH.1496T_c11_358-413 11/30/05 18:59 Page 379REVISED PAGESapplications of these metals are varied. For example, tantalum and molybdenum are alloyed with stainless steel to improve its corrosion resistance. Molybdenumalloys are utilized for extrusion dies and structural parts in space vehicles; incan-descent light filaments, x-ray tubes, and welding electrodes employ tungsten alloys.Tantalum is immune to chemical attack by virtually all environments at tem-peratures below and is frequently used in applications requiring such acorrosion-resistant material. The Superalloys The superalloys have superlative combinations of properties. Most are used in air-craft turbine components, which must withstand exposure to severely oxidizing en-vironments and high temperatures for reasonable time periods. Mechanical integrityunder these conditions is critical; in this regard, density is an important considera-tion because centrifugal stresses are diminished in rotating members when the den-sity is reduced. These materials are classified according to the predominant metalin the alloy, which may be cobalt, nickel, or iron. Other alloying elements includethe refractory metals (Nb, Mo, W, Ta), chromium, and titanium. In addition to tur-bine applications, these alloys are utilized in nuclear reactors and petrochemicalequipment. The Noble Metals The noble or precious metals are a group of eight elements that have some physi-cal characteristics in common. They are expensive (precious) and are superior ornotable (noble) in properties—that is, characteristically soft, ductile, and oxidationresistant. The noble metals are silver, gold, platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthe-nium, iridium, and osmium; the first three are most common and are used exten-sively in jewelry.

in jewelry. Silver and gold may be strengthened by solid-solution alloying withcopper; sterling silver is a silver–copper alloy containing approximately 7.5 wt%Cu. Alloys of both silver and gold are employed as dental restoration materials;also, some integrated circuit electrical contacts are of gold. Platinum is used forchemical laboratory equipment, as a catalyst (especially in the manufacture of gaso-line), and in thermocouples to measure elevated temperatures. Miscellaneous Nonferrous Alloys The discussion above covers the vast majority of nonferrous alloys; however, a num-ber of others are found in a variety of engineering applications, and a brief expo-sure of these is worthwhile. Nickel and its alloys are highly resistant to corrosion in many environments, es- pecially those that are basic (alkaline). Nickel is often coated or plated on somemetals that are susceptible to corrosion as a protective measure. Monel, a nickel-based alloy containing approximately 65 wt% Ni and 28 wt% Cu (the balance iron),has very high strength and is extremely corrosion resistant; it is used in pumps,valves, and other components that are in contact with some acid and petroleum so-lutions. As already mentioned, nickel is one of the principal alloying elements instainless steels and one of the major constituents in the superalloys. Lead, tin, and their alloys find some use as engineering materials. Both are me- chanically soft and weak, have low melting temperatures, are quite resistant to manycorrosion environments, and have recrystallization temperatures below room tem-perature. Some common solders are lead–tin alloys, which have low melting tem-peratures. Applications for lead and its alloys include x-ray shields and storagebatteries. The primary use of tin is as a very thin coating on the inside of plain150/H11034C,380 •Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys 1496T_c11_358-413 11/30/05 18:59 Page 380REVISED PAGES11.3 Nonferrous Alloys •381 Metal Alloys Used for Euro CoinsMATERIALS OF INTEREST On January 1st, 2002 the euro became the single legal currency in twelve European countries; since that date,several other nations have also joinedthe European monetary union, and have adoptedthe euro as their official currency.

official currency. Euro coins areminted in eight different denominations: 2 and 1 eu-ros, as well as 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cent euros. Eachcoin has a common design on one face, whereas thereverse face design is one of several chosen by themonetary union countries. Several of these coins areshown in the photograph of Figure 11.6. In deciding which metal alloys to use for these coins, a number of issues were considered; most ofthem centered on material properties. The ability to distinguish a coin of one denom- ination from that of another denomination is important. This may be accomplished by hav-ing coins of different sizes, different colors, anddifferent shapes. With regard to color, alloysmust be chosen that retain their distinctivecolors, which means that they do not easilytarnish in the air and other commonly encoun-tered environments. Security is an important issue—that is, produc- ing coins that are difficult to counterfeit. Mostvending machines use electrical conductivity toidentify coins, to prevent false coins from be-ing used. This means that each coin must haveits own unique “electronic signature,” whichdepends on its alloy composition.• The alloys chosen must be “coinable” or easy to mint—that is, sufficiently soft and ductile toallow design reliefs to be stamped into thecoin surfaces. Also, the alloys must be wear resistant (i.e., hard and strong) for long-term use, and so thatthe reliefs stamped into the coin surfaces areretained. Of course, strain-hardening (Section7.10) occurs during the stamping operationwhich enhances hardness. High degrees of corrosion resistance in com- mon environments are required for the alloysselected, to ensure minimal material lossesover the lifetimes of the coins. It is highly desirable to use alloys of a base metal (or metals) that retains (retain) its(their) intrinsic value(s).

intrinsic value(s). Alloy recyclability is another requirement for the alloy(s) used. The alloy(s) from which the coins are made should also provide for human health—that is,have antibacterial characteristics so undesirablemicroorganisms will not grow on their surfaces. Copper was selected as the base metal for all euro coins, inasmuch as it and its alloys satisfy theabove criteria. Several different copper alloys andalloy combinations are used for the eight differ-ent coins. These are as follows: 2 euro coin: This coin is termed “bimetallic”—it consists of an outer ring and an inner disk. For the outer ring, a 75Cu–25Ni alloy is used, whichhas a silver color. The inner disk is composed ofa three-layer structure—high-purity nickel thatis clad on both sides with a nickel brass alloy(75Cu–20Zn–5Ni); this alloy has a gold color. 1 euro coin: This coin is also bimetallic, whereas the alloys used for its outer ring and inner diskare reversed from those for the 2 euro. 50, 20, and 10 euro cent pieces: These coins are made of a “Nordic Gold”alloy—89Cu–5Al–5Zn–1Sn. 5, 2, and 1 euro cent pieces: Copper-plated steels are used for these coins.

Unalloyed zinc also is a relatively soft metal having a low melting temperature and a subambient recrystallization temperature.

recrystallization temperature. Chemically, it is reactive in a num-ber of common environments and, therefore, susceptible to corrosion. Galvanizedsteel is just plain carbon steel that has been coated with a thin zinc layer; the zincpreferentially corrodes and protects the steel (Section 17.9). Typical applications ofgalvanized steel are familiar (sheet metal, fences, screen, screws, etc.). Common ap-plications of zinc alloys include padlocks, plumbing fixtures, automotive parts (doorhandles and grilles), and office equipment. Although zirconium is relatively abundant in the earth’s crust, it was not until quite recent times that commercial refining techniques were developed. Zirconiumand its alloys are ductile and have other mechanical characteristics that are com-parable to those of titanium alloys and the austenitic stainless steels. However, theprimary asset of these alloys is their resistance to corrosion in a host of corrosivemedia, including superheated water. Furthermore, zirconium is transparent to ther-mal neutrons, so that its alloys have been used as cladding for uranium fuel in water-cooled nuclear reactors. In terms of cost, these alloys are also often the materialsof choice for heat exchangers, reactor vessels, and piping systems for the chemical-processing and nuclear industries. They are also used in incendiary ordnance andin sealing devices for vacuum tubes. In Appendix B is tabulated a wide variety of properties (e.g., density, elastic modulus, yield and tensile strengths, electrical resistivity, coefficient of thermal ex-pansion, etc.) for a large number of metals and alloys. Fabrication of Metals Metal fabrication techniques are normally preceded by refining, alloying, and oftenheat-treating processes that produce alloys with the desired characteristics.The clas-sifications of fabrication techniques include various metal-forming methods, cast-ing, powder metallurgy, welding, and machining; often two or more of them mustbe used before a piece is finished.

is finished. The methods chosen depend on several factors;the most important are the properties of the metal, the size and shape of the finishedpiece, and, of course, cost. The metal fabrication techniques we discuss are classi-fied according to the scheme illustrated in Figure 11.7.382 •Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys Metal fabrication techniques Forming operations Casting Miscellaneous Forging Rolling Extrusion Drawing Sand Die Investment Lost foam Continuous Powder metallurgyWelding Figure 11.7 Classification scheme of metal fabrication techniques discussed in this chapter.1496T_c11_358-413 11/30/05 18:59 Page 382REVISED PAGES11.4 FORMING OPERATIONS Forming operations are those in which the shape of a metal piece is changed by plastic deformation; for example, forging, rolling, extrusion, and drawing are com-mon forming techniques. Of course, the deformation must be induced by an exter-nal force or stress, the magnitude of which must exceed the yield strength of thematerial. Most metallic materials are especially amenable to these procedures, beingat least moderately ductile and capable of some permanent deformation withoutcracking or fracturing. When deformation is achieved at a temperature above that at which recrys- tallization occurs, the process is termed hot working (Section 7.12); otherwise, it is cold working. With most of the forming techniques, both hot- and cold-workingprocedures are possible. For hot-working operations, large deformations are pos-sible, which may be successively repeated because the metal remains soft andductile. Also, deformation energy requirements are less than for cold working.However, most metals experience some surface oxidation, which results in mate-rial loss and a poor final surface finish. Cold working produces an increase in strength with the attendant decrease in ductility, since the metal strain hardens;advantages over hot working include a higher quality surface finish, better me-chanical properties and a greater variety of them, and closer dimensional controlof the finished piece.

finished piece. On occasion, the total deformation is accomplished in a se-ries of steps in which the piece is successively cold worked a small amount andthen process annealed (Section 11.7); however, this is an expensive and incon-venient procedure. The forming operations to be discussed are illustrated schematically in Figure 11.8.11.4 Forming Operations •383 hot working cold working Metal blank DieDie Die holderDieTensile force(a) (b) (d) (c)Dummy blockForceContainer ContainerRoll Roll Ram Billet ExtrusionForce ForceDie DieDie Forged piece DieFigure 11.8 Metal deformation during (a) forging, (b) rolling, (c) extrusion, and (d) drawing.1496T_c11_358-413 11/30/05 18:59 Page 383REVISED PAGESForging Forging is mechanically working or deforming a single piece of a normally hot metal; this may be accomplished by the application of successive blows or by con- tinuous squeezing. Forgings are classified as either closed or open die. For closeddie, a force is brought to bear on two or more die halves having the finished shapesuch that the metal is deformed in the cavity between them (Figure 11.8 a). For open die, two dies having simple geometric shapes (e.g., parallel flat, semicircular)are employed, normally on large workpieces. Forged articles have outstanding grainstructures and the best combination of mechanical properties. Wrenches, and au-tomotive crankshafts and piston connecting rods are typical articles formed usingthis technique. Rolling Rolling, the most widely used deformation process, consists of passing a piece of metal between two rolls; a reduction in thickness results from compressive stressesexerted by the rolls. Cold rolling may be used in the production of sheet, strip, andfoil with high quality surface finish.

surface finish. Circular shapes as well as I-beams and railroadrails are fabricated using grooved rolls. Extrusion For extrusion, a bar of metal is forced through a die orifice by a compressive force that is applied to a ram; the extruded piece that emerges has the desired shape anda reduced cross-sectional area. Extrusion products include rods and tubing thathave rather complicated cross-sectional geometries; seamless tubing may also be extruded. Drawing Drawing is the pulling of a metal piece through a die having a tapered bore by means of a tensile force that is applied on the exit side. A reduction in cross sec-tion results, with a corresponding increase in length. The total drawing operationmay consist of a number of dies in a series sequence. Rod, wire, and tubing prod-ucts are commonly fabricated in this way. 11.5 CASTING Casting is a fabrication process whereby a totally molten metal is poured into amold cavity having the desired shape; upon solidification, the metal assumes theshape of the mold but experiences some shrinkage. Casting techniques are em-ployed when (1) the finished shape is so large or complicated that any othermethod would be impractical, (2) a particular alloy is so low in ductility that form-ing by either hot or cold working would be difficult, and (3) in comparison toother fabrication processes, casting is the most economical. Furthermore, the fi-nal step in the refining of even ductile metals may involve a casting process. Anumber of different casting techniques are commonly employed, including sand,die, investment, lost foam, and continuous casting. Only a cursory treatment ofeach of these is offered. Sand Casting With sand casting, probably the most common method, ordinary sand is used as themold material. A two-piece mold is formed by packing sand around a pattern thathas the shape of the intended casting. Furthermore, a gating system is usually384 •Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys rolling extrusionforging drawing1496T_c11_358-413 11/30/05 18:59 Page 384REVISED PAGESincorporated into the mold to expedite the flow of molten metal into the cavity and to minimize internal casting defects.

casting defects. Sand-cast parts include automotive cylinderblocks, fire hydrants, and large pipe fittings. Die Casting In die casting, the liquid metal is forced into a mold under pressure and at a rela-tively high velocity, and allowed to solidify with the pressure maintained. A two-piece permanent steel mold or die is employed; when clamped together, the twopieces form the desired shape. When complete solidification has been achieved, thedie pieces are opened and the cast piece is ejected. Rapid casting rates are possi-ble, making this an inexpensive method; furthermore, a single set of dies may beused for thousands of castings. However, this technique lends itself only to rela-tively small pieces and to alloys of zinc, aluminum, and magnesium, which have lowmelting temperatures. Investment Casting For investment (sometimes called lost-wax) casting, the pattern is made from a waxor plastic that has a low melting temperature. Around the pattern is poured a fluidslurry, which sets up to form a solid mold or investment; plaster of paris is usuallyused. The mold is then heated, such that the pattern melts and is burned out, leav-ing behind a mold cavity having the desired shape.This technique is employed whenhigh dimensional accuracy, reproduction of fine detail, and an excellent finish arerequired—for example, in jewelry and dental crowns and inlays. Also, blades for gasturbines and jet engine impellers are investment cast. Lost Foam Casting A variation of investment casting is lost foam (or expendable pattern) casting. Here the expendable pattern is a foam that can be formed by compressing poly-styrene beads into the desired shape and then bonding them together by heat-ing. Alternatively, pattern shapes can be cut from sheets and assembled with glue.Sand is then packed around the pattern to form the mold. As the molten metalis poured into the mold, it replaces the pattern which vaporizes.

which vaporizes. The compactedsand remains in place, and, upon solidification, the metal assumes the shape ofthe mold. With lost foam casting, complex geometries and tight tolerances are possible. Furthermore, in comparison to sand casting, lost foam is a simpler, quicker, and lessexpensive process, and there are fewer environmental wastes. Metal alloys that mostcommonly use this technique are cast irons and aluminum alloys; furthermore,applications include automobile engine blocks, cylinder heads, crankshafts, marineengine blocks, and electric motor frames. Continuous Casting At the conclusion of extraction processes, many molten metals are solidified by cast-ing into large ingot molds.The ingots are normally subjected to a primary hot-rollingoperation, the product of which is a flat sheet or slab; these are more convenientshapes as starting points for subsequent secondary metal-forming operations (i.e.,forging, extrusion, drawing). These casting and rolling steps may be combined by acontinuous casting (sometimes also termed “strand casting”) process. Using this technique, the refined and molten metal is cast directly into a continuous strandthat may have either a rectangular or circular cross section; solidification occurs ina water-cooled die having the desired cross-sectional geometry. The chemical11.5 Casting •3851496T_c11_358-413 12/1/05 14:50 Page 385REVISED PAGEScomposition and mechanical properties are more uniform throughout the cross sec- tions for continuous castings than for ingot-cast products. Furthermore, continuouscasting is highly automated and more efficient. 11.6 MISCELLANEOUS TECHNIQUES Powder Metallurgy Yet another fabrication technique involves the compaction of powdered metal, fol-lowed by a heat treatment to produce a more dense piece. The process is appro-priately called powder metallurgy, frequently designated as P/M.

as P/M. Powder metallurgy makes it possible to produce a virtually nonporous piece having properties almostequivalent to the fully dense parent material. Diffusional processes during the heattreatment are central to the development of these properties. This method is espe-cially suitable for metals having low ductilities, since only small plastic deformationof the powder particles need occur. Metals having high melting temperatures aredifficult to melt and cast, and fabrication is expedited using P/M. Furthermore, partsthat require very close dimensional tolerances (e.g., bushings and gears) may beeconomically produced using this technique.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Welding In a sense, welding may be considered to be a fabrication technique. In welding, two or more metal parts are joined to form a single piece when one-part fabricationis expensive or inconvenient. Both similar and dissimilar metals may be welded.Thejoining bond is metallurgical (involving some diffusion) rather than just mechanical,as with riveting and bolting. A variety of welding methods exist, including arc andgas welding, as well as brazing and soldering. During arc and gas welding, the workpieces to be joined and the filler material (i.e., welding rod) are heated to a sufficiently high temperature to cause both tomelt; upon solidification, the filler material forms a fusion joint between the work-pieces. Thus, there is a region adjacent to the weld that may have experienced mi-crostructural and property alterations; this region is termed the heat-affected zone (sometimes abbreviated HAZ). Possible alterations include the following: 1.If the workpiece material was previously cold worked, this heat-affected zonemay have experienced recrystallization and grain growth, and thus a dimin-ishment of strength, hardness, and toughness.

and toughness. The HAZ for this situation is represented schematically in Figure 11.9. 2.Upon cooling, residual stresses may form in this region that weaken the joint. 3.For steels, the material in this zone may have been heated to temperaturessufficiently high so as to form austenite. Upon cooling to room tempera-ture, the microstructural products that form depend on cooling rate andalloy composition. For plain carbon steels, normally pearlite and a proeu-tectoid phase will be present. However, for alloy steels, one microstructural386 •Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys powder metallurgy welding1496T_c11_358-413 11/30/05 18:59 Page 386REVISED PAGESproduct may be martensite, which is ordinarily undesirable because it is so brittle. 4.Some stainless steels may be “sensitized” during welding, which renders themsusceptible to intergranular corrosion, as explained in Section 17.7. A relatively modern joining technique is that of laser beam welding, wherein a highly focused and intense laser beam is used as the heat source. The laser beam melts the parent metal, and, upon solidification, a fusion joint is produced; often afiller material need not be used. Some of the advantages of this technique are asfollows: (1) it is a noncontact process, which eliminates mechanical distortion of theworkpieces; (2) it can be rapid and highly automated; (3) energy input to the work-piece is low, and therefore the heat-affected zone size is minimal; (4) welds may besmall in size and very precise; (5) a large variety of metals and alloys may be joinedusing this technique; and (6) porosity-free welds with strengths equal to or in ex-cess of the base metal are possible.

are possible. Laser beam welding is used extensively in theautomotive and electronic industries where high quality and rapid welding rates arerequired.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Thermal Processing of Metals Earlier chapters have discussed a number of phenomena that occur in metals andalloys at elevated temperatures—for example, recrystallization and the decomposi-tion of austenite. These are effective in altering the mechanical characteristics whenappropriate heat treatments or thermal processes are employed. In fact, the use ofheat treatments on commercial alloys is an exceedingly common practice. There-fore, we consider next the details of some of these processes, including annealingprocedures, the heat treating of steels, and precipitation hardening.11.6 Miscellaneous Techniques •387 Weld metalPortion from filler metalPortion frombase metal Heat affectedzone Workpiece 1 Workpiece 2Fused basemetalFigure 11.9 Schematic cross- sectional representation showing the zones in the vicinity of atypical fusion weld.

Ordi- narily, annealing is carried out to (1) relieve stresses; (2) increase softness, ductility,and toughness; and/or (3) produce a specific microstructure. A variety of annealingheat treatments are possible; they are characterized by the changes that are induced,which many times are microstructural and are responsible for the alteration of themechanical properties.

themechanical properties. Any annealing process consists of three stages: (1) heating to the desired tem- perature, (2) holding or “soaking” at that temperature, and (3) cooling, usually toroom temperature. Time is an important parameter in these procedures. Duringheating and cooling, there exist temperature gradients between the outside and in-terior portions of the piece; their magnitudes depend on the size and geometry ofthe piece. If the rate of temperature change is too great, temperature gradients andinternal stresses may be induced that may lead to warping or even cracking. Also,the actual annealing time must be long enough to allow for any necessary trans-formation reactions. Annealing temperature is also an important consideration;annealing may be accelerated by increasing the temperature, since diffusionalprocesses are normally involved. Process Annealing Process annealing is a heat treatment that is used to negate the effects of cold work—that is, to soften and increase the ductility of a previously strain-hardenedmetal. It is commonly utilized during fabrication procedures that require extensiveplastic deformation, to allow a continuation of deformation without fracture or ex-cessive energy consumption. Recovery and recrystallization processes are allowedto occur. Ordinarily a fine-grained microstructure is desired, and therefore, the heattreatment is terminated before appreciable grain growth has occurred. Surface ox-idation or scaling may be prevented or minimized by annealing at a relatively lowtemperature (but above the recrystallization temperature) or in a nonoxidizingatmosphere. Stress Relief Internal residual stresses may develop in metal pieces in response to the following:(1) plastic deformation processes such as machining and grinding; (2) nonuniformcooling of a piece that was processed or fabricated at an elevated temperature, suchas a weld or a casting; and (3) a phase transformation that is induced upon coolingwherein parent and product phases have different densities.

different densities. Distortion and warpagemay result if these residual stresses are not removed. They may be eliminated by astress relief annealing heat treatment in which the piece is heated to the recom- mended temperature, held there long enough to attain a uniform temperature, andfinally cooled to room temperature in air. The annealing temperature is ordinarilya relatively low one such that effects resulting from cold working and other heattreatments are not affected. Annealing of Ferrous Alloys Several different annealing procedures are employed to enhance the properties ofsteel alloys. However, before they are discussed, some comment relative to the la-beling of phase boundaries is necessary. Figure 11.10 shows the portion of theiron–iron carbide phase diagram in the vicinity of the eutectoid. The horizontal line388 •Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys annealing process annealing stress relief1496T_c11_358-413 11/30/05 18:59 Page 388REVISED PAGESat the eutectoid temperature, conventionally labeled , is termed the lower critical temperature, below which, under equilibrium conditions, all austenite will have transformed into ferrite and cementite phases. The phase boundaries denoted as and represent the upper critical temperature lines, for hypoeutectoid and hypereutectoid steels, respectively. For temperatures and compositions above these boundaries, only the austenite phase will prevail. As explained in Section 9.20,other alloying elements will shift the eutectoid and the positions of these phaseboundary lines. Normalizing Steels that have been plastically deformed by, for example, a rolling operation, con-sist of grains of pearlite (and most likely a proeutectoid phase), which are irregu-larly shaped and relatively large, but vary substantially in size. An annealing heattreatment called normalizing is used to refine the grains (i.e., to decrease the average grain size) and produce a more uniform and desirable size distribution; fine-grainedpearlitic steels are tougher than coarse-grained ones.

coarse-grained ones. Normalizing is accomplishedby heating at least ( ) above the upper critical temperature—that is, above for compositions less than the eutectoid (0.76 wt% C), and above for com- positions greater than the eutectoid as represented in Figure 11.10. After sufficienttime has been allowed for the alloy to completely transform to austenite—a pro-cedure termed austenitizing—the treatment is terminated by cooling in air. A nor-malizing cooling curve is superimposed on the continuous cooling transformationdiagram (Figure 10.26). Full Anneal A heat treatment known as full annealing is often utilized in low- and medium- carbon steels that will be machined or will experience extensive plastic deforma-tion during a forming operation. In general, the alloy is treated by heating to a tem-perature of about above the line (to form austenite) for compositions lessthan the eutectoid, or, for compositions in excess of the eutectoid, C above theA 1line (to form austenite and Fe 3C phases), as noted in Figure 11.10. The alloy is then furnace cooled; that is, the heat-treating furnace is turned off and both fur-nace and steel cool to room temperature at the same rate, which takes several hours.The microstructural product of this anneal is coarse pearlite (in addition to any50/H11034A 3 50/H11034CAcm A3100/H11034F 55/H11034CAcm A3A111.7 Annealing Processes •389 1000 900 800 700 600 0 0.4 0.6 0.2 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.61800 170016001500140013001200Normalizing Full annealingA cm A3 A1 Composition (wt% C)Temperature (°C) Temperature (°F)Figure 11.10 The iron–iron carbide phase diagram in the vicinity of the eutectoid, indicating heat-treating temperature ranges for plain carbon steels.

The full-anneal cooling pro- cedure (also shown in Figure 10.26) is time consuming; however, a microstructurehaving small grains and a uniform grain structure results. Spheroidizing Medium- and high-carbon steels having a microstructure containing even coarsepearlite may still be too hard to conveniently machine or plastically deform. Thesesteels, and in fact any steel, may be heat treated or annealed to develop the spher-oidite structure as described in Section 10.5. Spheroidized steels have a maximumsoftness and ductility and are easily machined or deformed. The spheroidizing heat treatment, during which there is a coalescence of the Fe 3C to form the spheroid particles (see the chapter-opening photograph for Chapter 10), can take place byseveral methods, as follows: Heating the alloy at a temperature just below the eutectoid [line A 1in Figure 11.10, or at about ( )] in the region of the phase dia- gram. If the precursor microstructure contains pearlite, spheroidizing times willordinarily range between 15 and 25 h. Heating to a temperature just above the eutectoid temperature, and then either cooling very slowly in the furnace, or holding at a temperature just below theeutectoid temperature. Heating and cooling alternately within about of the line of Figure 11.10. To some degree, the rate at which spheroidite forms depends on prior mi- crostructure.

mi- crostructure. For example, it is slowest for pearlite, and the finer the pearlite, themore rapid the rate. Also, prior cold work increases the spheroidizing reaction rate. Still other annealing treatments are possible. For example, glasses are annealed, as outlined in Section 13.9, to remove residual internal stresses that render the ma-terial excessively weak. In addition, microstructural alterations and the attendantmodification of mechanical properties of cast irons, as discussed in Section 11.2,result from what are in a sense annealing treatments. 11.8 HEAT TREATMENT OF STEELS Conventional heat treatment procedures for producing martensitic steels ordinar-ily involve continuous and rapid cooling of an austenitized specimen in some typeof quenching medium, such as water, oil, or air. The optimum properties of a steelthat has been quenched and then tempered can be realized only if, during thequenching heat treatment, the specimen has been converted to a high content ofmartensite; the formation of any pearlite and/or bainite will result in other than thebest combination of mechanical characteristics. During the quenching treatment, itis impossible to cool the specimen at a uniform rate throughout—the surface willalways cool more rapidly than interior regions. Therefore, the austenite will trans-form over a range of temperatures, yielding a possible variation of microstructureand properties with position within a specimen. The successful heat treating of steels to produce a predominantly martensitic microstructure throughout the cross section depends mainly on three factors: (1) thecomposition of the alloy, (2) the type and character of the quenching medium, and(3) the size and shape of the specimen. The influence of each of these factors is nowaddressed.A 1 /H1100650/H11034Ca/H11001Fe3C 1300/H11034F 700/H11034C390 •Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys spheroidizing1496T_c11_358-413 11/30/05 18:59 Page 390REVISED PAGESHardenability The influence of alloy composition on the ability of a steel alloy to transform to martensite for a particular quenching treatment is related to a parameter calledhardenability.

parameter calledhardenability. For every different steel alloy there is a specific relationship between the mechanical properties and the cooling rate. “Hardenability” is a term that isused to describe the ability of an alloy to be hardened by the formation of marten-site as a result of a given heat treatment. Hardenability is not “hardness,” which isthe resistance to indentation; rather, hardenability is a qualitative measure of therate at which hardness drops off with distance into the interior of a specimen as aresult of diminished martensite content. A steel alloy that has a high hardenabilityis one that hardens, or forms martensite, not only at the surface but to a large degreethroughout the entire interior. The Jominy End-Quench Test One standard procedure that is widely utilized to determine hardenability is theJominy end-quench test. 1With this procedure, except for alloy composition, all fac- tors that may influence the depth to which a piece hardens (i.e., specimen size andshape, and quenching treatment) are maintained constant. A cylindrical specimen25.4 mm (1.0 in.) in diameter and 100 mm (4 in.) long is austenitized at a prescribedtemperature for a prescribed time. After removal from the furnace, it is quicklymounted in a fixture as diagrammed in Figure 11.11 a. The lower end is quenched by a jet of water of specified flow rate and temperature. Thus, the cooling rate is amaximum at the quenched end and diminishes with position from this point alongthe length of the specimen. After the piece has cooled to room temperature, shal-low flats 0.4 mm (0.015 in.) deep are ground along the specimen length and Rock-well hardness measurements are made for the first 50 mm (2 in.) along each flat(Figure 11.11b); for the first 12.8 mm ( in.

A hardenability curve is produced when hardness is plotted as a function of positionfrom the quenched end. Hardenability Curves A typical hardenability curve is represented in Figure 11.12. The quenched end iscooled most rapidly and exhibits the maximum hardness; 100% martensite is theproduct at this position for most steels. Cooling rate decreases with distance fromthe quenched end, and the hardness also decreases, as indicated in the figure. Withdiminishing cooling rate more time is allowed for carbon diffusion and the forma-tion of a greater proportion of the softer pearlite, which may be mixed with marten-site and bainite. Thus, a steel that is highly hardenable will retain large hardnessvalues for relatively long distances; a low hardenable one will not. Also, each steelalloy has its own unique hardenability curve.

hardenability curve. Sometimes, it is convenient to relate hardness to a cooling rate rather than to the location from the quenched end of a standard Jominy specimen. Cooling rate[taken at C ( F)] is ordinarily shown on the upper horizontal axis of a hard-enability diagram; this scale is included with the hardenability plots presented here.This correlation between position and cooling rate is the same for plain carbon andmany alloy steels because the rate of heat transfer is nearly independent of com-position. On occasion, cooling rate or position from the quenched end is specifiedin terms of Jominy distance, one Jominy distance unit being 1.6 mm ( in.). A correlation may be drawn between position along the Jominy specimen and continuous cooling transformations. For example, Figure 11.13 is a continuous coolingtransformation diagram for a eutectoid iron–carbon alloy onto which are superim-posed the cooling curves at four different Jominy positions, and correspondingmicrostructures that result for each. The hardenability curve for this alloy is alsoincluded. The hardenability curves for five different steel alloys all having 0.40 wt% C, yet differing amounts of other alloying elements, are shown in Figure 11.14. Onespecimen is a plain carbon steel (1040); the other four (4140, 4340, 5140, and 8640)are alloy steels. The compositions of the four alloy steels are included with the fig-ure. The significance of the alloy designation numbers (e.g., 1040) is explained inSection 11.2. Several details are worth noting from this figure. First, all five alloyshave identical hardnesses at the quenched end (57 HRC); this hardness is a func-tion of carbon content only, which is the same for all these alloys. Probably the most significant feature of these curves is shape, which relates to hardenability.

By way of contrast, the decreases in hardness for the otherfour alloy steels are distinctly more gradual. For example, at a Jominy distance of50 mm (2 in. ), the hardnesses of the 4340 and 8640 alloys are approximately 50 and32 HRC, respectively; thus, of these two alloys, the 4340 is more hardenable.A water-quenched specimen of the 1040 plain carbon steel would harden only to a shallowdepth below the surface, whereas for the other four alloy steels the high quenchedhardness would persist to a much greater depth. The hardness profiles in Figure 11.14 are indicative of the influence of cooling rate on the microstructure. At the quenched end, where the quenching rate is ap-proximately C/s ( F/s), 100% martensite is present for all five alloys. Forcooling rates less than about C/s ( F/s) or Jominy distances greater than about6.4 mm ( in. ), the microstructure of the 1040 steel is predominantly pearlitic, withsome proeutectoid ferrite. However, the microstructures of the four alloy steels con-sist primarily of a mixture of martensite and bainite; bainite content increases withdecreasing cooling rate. This disparity in hardenability behavior for the five alloys in Figure 11.14 is ex- plained by the presence of nickel, chromium, and molybdenum in the alloy steels.These alloying elements delay the austenite-to-pearlite and/or bainite reactions, asexplained above; this permits more martensite to form for a particular cooling rate,yielding a greater hardness.

greater hardness. The right-hand axis of Figure 11.14 shows the approxi-mate percentage of martensite that is present at various hardnesses for these alloys. The hardenability curves also depend on carbon content. This effect is demon- strated in Figure 11.15 for a series of alloy steels in which only the concentrationof carbon is varied. The hardness at any Jominy position increases with the con-centration of carbon. Also, during the industrial production of steel, there is always a slight, un- avoidable variation in composition and average grain size from one batch to another. 1 4125/H11034 70/H110341100/H11034 600/H110341 4394 •Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys 8620 (0.2 wt% C)8630 (0.3 wt% C)8640 (0.4 wt% C)8660 (0.6 wt% C)Hardness, HRC 20405060170 70 31 18 9 5.6 3.9 2.8 2305 490 270125 56 33 16.3 10Cooling rate at 700°C (1300°F) 7 5.1 3.5 °C/s°F/s 30 Distance from quenched end0 10 20 30 40 50 mm 01 41 23 411 41 231 1 142 in.Figure 11.15 Hardenability curves forfour 8600 series alloys ofindicated carbon content.

Such a hardenability band is plotted inFigure 11.16 for an 8640 steel.

8640 steel. An H following the designation specification for analloy (e.g., 8640H) indicates that the composition and characteristics of the alloyare such that its hardenability curve will lie within a specified band. Influence of Quenching Medium, Specimen Size, and Geometry The preceding treatment of hardenability discussed the influence of both alloy composition and cooling or quenching rate on the hardness. The cooling rate of aspecimen depends on the rate of heat energy extraction, which is a function of thecharacteristics of the quenching medium in contact with the specimen surface, aswell as the specimen size and geometry. “Severity of quench” is a term often used to indicate the rate of cooling; the more rapid the quench, the more severe the quench. Of the three most commonquenching media—water, oil, and air—water produces the most severe quench, fol-lowed by oil, which is more effective than air. 2The degree of agitation of each medium also influences the rate of heat removal. Increasing the velocity of thequenching medium across the specimen surface enhances the quenching effective-ness. Oil quenches are suitable for the heat treating of many alloy steels.

Air cooling of austenitized plain carbon steels ordinarily pro-duces an almost totally pearlitic structure. During the quenching of a steel specimen, heat energy must be transported to the surface before it can be dissipated into the quenching medium. As a conse-quence, the cooling rate within and throughout the interior of a steel structure varieswith position and depends on the geometry and size. Figures 11.17 aand 11.17b show the quenching rate at C ( F) as a function of diameter for cylindrical barsat four radial positions (surface, three-quarters radius, midradius, and center).Quenching is in mildly agitated water (Figure 11.17 a) and oil (Figure 11.17 b); cool- ing rate is also expressed as equivalent Jominy distance, since these data are oftenused in conjunction with hardenability curves. Diagrams similar to those in Fig-ure 11.17 have also been generated for geometries other than cylindrical (e.g., flatplates). One utility of such diagrams is in the prediction of the hardness traverse along the cross section of a specimen. For example, Figure 11.18a compares the radial hardness distributions for cylindrical plain carbon (1040) and alloy (4140) steelspecimens; both have a diameter of 50 mm (2 in.) and are water quenched. Thedifference in hardenability is evident from these two profiles.

Example Problem 11.1 illustrates how these hardness profilesare determined. As far as specimen shape is concerned, since the heat energy is dissipated to the quenching medium at the specimen surface, the rate of cooling for a particularquenching treatment depends on the ratio of surface area to the mass of the spec-imen.The larger this ratio, the more rapid will be the cooling rate and, consequently,the deeper the hardening effect. Irregular shapes with edges and corners have largersurface-to-mass ratios than regular and rounded shapes (e.g., spheres and cylinders)and are thus more amenable to hardening by quenching. There are a multitude of steels that are responsive to a martensitic heat treat- ment, and one of the most important criteria in the selection process is harden-ability. Hardenability curves, when utilized in conjunction with plots such as thosein Figure 11.17 for various quenching media, may be used to ascertain the suitabil-ity of a specific steel alloy for a particular application. Or, conversely, the appro-priateness of a quenching procedure for an alloy may be determined. For parts thatare to be involved in relatively high stress applications, a minimum of 80% marten-site must be produced throughout the interior as a consequence of the quenchingprocedure. Only a 50% minimum is required for moderately stressed parts.

Solution First, evaluate the cooling rate (in terms of the Jominy end-quench distance) at center, surface, mid-, and three-quarter radial positions of the cylindricalspecimen. This is accomplished using the cooling rate-versus-bar diameterplot for the appropriate quenching medium, in this case, Figure 11.17 a. Then, convert the cooling rate at each of these radial positions into a hardness valuefrom a hardenability plot for the particular alloy. Finally, determine the hard-ness profile by plotting the hardness as a function of radial position. This procedure is demonstrated in Figure 11.19, for the center position.

The design calls for a 1-in. diameter cylindrical shaft having a surface hardness of at least 38 HRCand a minimum ductility of 12%EL. Specify an alloy and treatment that meetthese criteria. Solution First of all, cost is also most likely an important design consideration. This would probably eliminate relatively expensive steels, such as stainless and those thatare precipitation hardenable. Therefore, let us begin by examining plain-carbonand low-alloy steels, and what treatments are available to alter their mechanicalcharacteristics. It is unlikely that merely cold working one of these steels would produce the desired combination of hardness and ductility. For example, from Figure 6.19, ahardness of 38 HRC corresponds to a tensile strength of 1200 MPa (175,000 psi).The tensile strength as a function of percent cold work for a 1040 steel is repre-sented in Figure 7.19 b. Here it may be noted that at 50%CW, a tensile strength of only about 900 MPa (130,000 psi) is achieved; furthermore, the correspondingductility is approximately 10%EL (Figure 7.19 c). Hence, both of these proper- ties fall short of those specified in the design; furthermore, cold working otherplain-carbon or low-alloy steels would probably not achieve the required mini-mum values. Another possibility is to perform a series of heat treatments in which the steel is austenitized, quenched (to form martensite), and finally tempered.

finally tempered. Letus now examine the mechanical properties of various plain-carbon and low-alloysteels that have been heat treated in this manner. To begin, the surface hardnessof the quenched material (which ultimately affects the tempered hardness) willdepend on both alloy content and shaft diameter, as discussed in the previoustwo sections. For example, the degree to which surface hardness decreases with11.8 Heat Treatment of Steels •399 rate at the center is equivalent to that approximately 9.5 mm ( in.) from the Jominy specimen quenched end (Figure 11.19 a). This corresponds to a hard- ness of about 28 HRC, as noted from the hardenability plot for the 1040 steelalloy (Figure 11.19 b). Finally, this data point is plotted on the hardness pro- file in Figure 11.19 c. Surface, midradius, and three-quarter radius hardnesses would be deter- mined in a similar manner.

The process is called precipitation hard- ening because the small particles of the new phase are termed “precipitates.” “Age hardening” is also used to designate this procedure because the strength developswith time, or as the alloy ages. Examples of alloys that are hardened by precipita-tion treatments include aluminum–copper, copper–beryllium, copper–tin, andmagnesium–aluminum; some ferrous alloys are also precipitation hardenable. Precipitation hardening and the treating of steel to form tempered marten- site are totally different phenomena, even though the heat treatment proceduresare similar; therefore, the processes should not be confused. The principal differ-ence lies in the mechanisms by which hardening and strengthening are achieved.These should become apparent as precipitation hardening is explained. Heat Treatments Inasmuch as precipitation hardening results from the development of particles ofa new phase, an explanation of the heat treatment procedure is facilitated by useof a phase diagram. Even though, in practice, many precipitation-hardenable alloyscontain two or more alloying elements, the discussion is simplified by reference toa binary system. The phase diagram must be of the form shown for the hypotheti-cal A–B system in Figure 11.21. Two requisite features must be displayed by the phase diagrams of alloy sys- tems for precipitation hardening: an appreciable maximum solubility of one com-ponent in the other, on the order of several percent; and a solubility limit that rapidlydecreases in concentration of the major component with temperature reduction.Both these conditions are satisfied by this hypothetical phase diagram (Figure11.21).

diagram (Figure11.21). The maximum solubility corresponds to the composition at point M. In ad- dition, the solubility limit boundary between the and phase fields dimin-ishes from this maximum concentration to a very low B content in A at point N. Furthermore, the composition of a precipitation-hardenable alloy must be less thanthe maximum solubility. These conditions are necessary but notsufficient for pre- cipitation hardening to occur in an alloy system. An additional requirement isdiscussed below.a/H11001b a402 •Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys Composition (wt% B)Temperature AB/H9252/H9252 + L /H9251 + LL /H9251 + /H9252 T1 C/H9251C0NM /H9251 T2T0 C/H9252Figure 11.21 Hypothetical phase diagram for a precipitation-hardenablealloy of composition C 0.precipitation hardening1496T_c11_358-413 11/30/05 18:59 Page 402REVISED PAGESSolution Heat Treating Precipitation hardening is accomplished by two different heat treatments. The first is a solution heat treatment in which all solute atoms are dissolved to form a single- phase solid solution. Consider an alloy of composition in Figure 11.21. The treat-ment consists of heating the alloy to a temperature within the /H9251phase field—say, —and waiting until all the phase that may have been present is completely dis- solved. At this point, the alloy consists only of an /H9251phase of composition This procedure is followed by rapid cooling or quenching to temperature which formany alloys is room temperature, to the extent that any diffusion and the accom-panying formation of any of the phase are prevented. Thus, a nonequilibrium sit-uation exists in which only the -phase solid solution supersaturated with B atomsis present at in this state the alloy is relatively soft and weak.

and weak. Furthermore, formost alloys diffusion rates at are extremely slow, such that the single /H9251phase is retained at this temperature for relatively long periods. Precipitation Heat Treating For the second or precipitation heat treatment, the supersaturated /H9251 solid solution is ordinarily heated to an intermediate temperature (Figure 11.21) within the two-phase region, at which temperature diffusion rates become appreciable. The precipitate phase begins to form as finely dispersed particles of composi-tion which process is sometimes termed “aging.” After the appropriate agingtime at the alloy is cooled to room temperature; normally, this cooling rate isnot an important consideration. Both solution and precipitation heat treatmentsare represented on the temperature-versus-time plot, Figure 11.22. The characterof these /H9252 particles, and subsequently the strength and hardness of the alloy, de- pend on both the precipitation temperature and the aging time at this tem-perature. For some alloys, aging occurs spontaneously at room temperature overextended time periods. The dependence of the growth of the precipitate particles on time and tem- perature under isothermal heat treatment conditions may be represented by C-shapedcurves similar to those in Figure 10.18 for the eutectoid transformation in steels. How-ever, it is more useful and convenient to present the data as tensile strength, yieldstrength, or hardness at room temperature as a function of the logarithm of agingtime, at constant temperature The behavior for a typical precipitation-hardenablealloy is represented schematically in Figure 11.23. With increasing time, the strengthor hardness increases, reaches a maximum, and finally diminishes. This reduction instrength and hardness that occurs after long time periods is known as overaging.

of temperatures. Mechanism of Hardening Precipitation hardening is commonly employed with high-strength aluminum alloys.Although a large number of these alloys have different proportions and combina-tions of alloying elements, the mechanism of hardening has perhaps been studiedmost extensively for the aluminum–copper alloys. Figure 11.24 presents the alu-minum-rich portion of the aluminum–copper phase diagram. The phase is asubstitutional solid solution of copper in aluminum, whereas the intermetallic com-pound CuAl 2is designated the phase. For an aluminum–copper alloy of, say, com- position 96 wt% Al–4 wt% Cu, in the development of this equilibrium phaseduring the precipitation heat treatment, several transition phases are first formedin a specific sequence. The mechanical properties are influenced by the characterof the particles of these transition phases. During the initial hardening stage (atshort times, Figure 11.23), copper atoms cluster together in very small and thin discsthat are only one or two atoms thick and approximately 25 atoms in diameter;these form at countless positions within the phase. The clusters, sometimes calledzones, are so small that they are really not regarded as distinct precipitate particles.auua404 •Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys Strength or hardnessZonesOveraging Logarithm of aging time/H9258/H9258' /H9258"Figure 11.23 Schematic diagram showing strength and hardness as a functionof the logarithm of agingtime at constanttemperature during theprecipitation heattreatment.

As noted in the figure, maximum strength coincides with the formation of the phase, which maybe preserved upon cooling the alloy to room temperature. Overaging results fromcontinued particle growth and the development of and phases. The strengthening process is accelerated as the temperature is increased. This is demonstrated in Figure 11.27 a, a plot of yield strength versus the logarithm of time for a 2014 aluminum alloy at several different precipitation temperatures. Ide-ally, temperature and time for the precipitation heat treatment should be designedto produce a hardness or strength in the vicinity of the maximum. Associated withan increase in strength is a reduction in ductility, which is demonstrated in Figure11.27b for the same 2014 aluminum alloy at the several temperatures. Not all alloys that satisfy the aforementioned conditions relative to composi- tion and phase diagram configuration are amenable to precipitation hardening.u u ¿u– Figure 11.27 The precipitation hardening characteristics of a 2014 aluminum alloy (0.9 wt% Si, 4.4 wt% Cu, 0.8 wt% Mn, 0.5 wt% Mg) at four different aging temperatures: (a) yield strength, and (b) ductility (%EL).

precipitate–matrix interface. For aluminum–copper alloys, there is a distortion of the crystal lattice structurearound and within the vicinity of particles of these transition phases (Figure11.25b ). During plastic deformation, dislocation motions are effectively impeded as a result of these distortions, and, consequently, the alloy becomes harder andstronger. As the phase forms, the resultant overaging (softening and weaken-ing) is explained by a reduction in the resistance to slip that is offered by theseprecipitate particles. Alloys that experience appreciable precipitation hardening at room tempera- ture and after relatively short time periods must be quenched to and stored underrefrigerated conditions. Several aluminum alloys that are used for rivets exhibit thisbehavior. They are driven while still soft, then allowed to age harden at the normalambient temperature. This is termed natural aging; artificial aging is carried out at elevated temperatures. Concept Check 1 1.9 Is it possible to produce a precipitation hardened 2014 aluminum alloy havinga minimum yield strength of 350 MPa (50,000 psi) and a ductility of at least18%EL? If so, specify the precipitation heat treatment. If it is not possible thenexplain why. [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Miscellaneous Considerations The combined effects of strain hardening and precipitation hardening may be em-ployed in high-strength alloys. The order of these hardening procedures is impor-tant in the production of alloys having the optimum combination of mechanicalproperties. Normally, the alloy is solution heat treated and then quenched. This isfollowed by cold working and finally by the precipitation-hardening heat treatment.In the final treatment, little strength loss is sustained as a result of recrystallization.If the alloy is precipitation hardened before cold working, more energy must beexpended in its deformation; in addition, cracking may also result because of thereduction in ductility that accompanies the precipitation hardening.

precipitation hardening. Most precipitation-hardened alloys are limited in their maximum service tem- peratures. Exposure to temperatures at which aging occurs may lead to a loss ofstrength due to overaging. SUMMARY Ferrous Alloys This chapter began with a discussion of the various types of metal alloys. With re- gard to composition, metals and alloys are classified as either ferrous or nonferrous.Ferrous alloys (steels and cast irons) are those in which iron is the prime constituent.Most steels contain less than 1.0 wt% C, and, in addition, other alloying elements,which render them susceptible to heat treatment (and an enhancement of me-chanical properties) and/or more corrosion resistant. Plain low-carbon steels andhigh-strength low-alloy, medium-carbon, tool, and stainless steels are the mostcommon types.uSummary •407 natural, artificial aging1496T_c11_358-413 11/30/05 18:59 Page 407REVISED PAGESCast irons contain a higher carbon content, normally between 3.0 and 4.5 wt% C, and other alloying elements, notably silicon. For these materials, most of the car- bon exists in graphite form rather than combined with iron as cementite. Gray, duc-tile (or nodular), malleable, and compacted graphite irons are the four most widelyused cast irons; the latter three are reasonably ductile. Nonferrous Alloys All other alloys fall within the nonferrous category, which is further subdivided ac- cording to base metal or some distinctive characteristic that is shared by a groupof alloys.The compositions, typical properties, and applications of copper, aluminum,magnesium, titanium, nickel, lead, tin, zirconium, and zinc alloys, as well as therefractory metals, the superalloys, and the noble metals were discussed.

were discussed. Forming Operations Casting Miscellaneous Techniques We next discussed various fabrication techniques that may be applied to metallic ma- terials. Forming operations are those in which a metal piece is shaped by plastic de-formation. When deformation is carried out above the recrystallization temperature,it is termed hot working; otherwise, it is cold working. Forging, rolling, extrusion, anddrawing are four of the more common forming techniques. Depending on the prop-erties and shape of the finished piece, casting may be the most desirable and eco-nomical fabrication process; sand, die, investment, lost foam, and continuous castingmethods were also treated. Additional fabrication procedures, including powder met-allurgy and welding, may be utilized alone or in combination with other methods. Annealing Processes The final sections of this chapter were devoted to discussions of some of the heat treatments that are used to fashion the mechanical properties of metal alloys. Theexposure to an elevated temperature for an extended time period followed bycooling to room temperature at a relatively slow rate is termed annealing; severalspecific annealing treatments were discussed briefly. During process annealing, acold-worked piece is rendered softer yet more ductile as a consequence of recrys-tallization. Internal residual stresses that have been introduced are eliminatedduring a stress-relief anneal. For ferrous alloys, normalizing is used to refine andimprove the grain structure. Fabrication characteristics may also be enhanced byfull anneal and spheroidizing treatments that produce microstructures consisting ofcoarse pearlite and spheroidite, respectively. Heat Treatment of Steels For high-strength steels, the best combination of mechanical characteristics may be realized if a predominantly martensitic microstructure is developed over the entirecross section; this is converted to tempered martensite during a tempering heat treat-ment. Hardenability is a parameter used to ascertain the influence of compositionon the susceptibility to the formation of a predominantly martensitic structure forsome specific heat treatment.

heat treatment. Determination of hardenability is accomplished by thestandard Jominy end-quench test, from which hardenability curves are generated. Other factors also influence the extent to which martensite will form. Of the common quenching media, water is the most efficient, followed by oil and air, in408 •Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys 1496T_c11_358-413 11/30/05 18:59 Page 408REVISED PAGESthat order. The relationships between cooling rate and specimen size and geome- try for a specific quenching medium frequently are expressed on empirical charts;two were introduced for cylindrical specimens. These may be used in conjunctionwith hardenability data to generate cross-sectional hardness profiles. Precipitation Hardening Some alloys are amenable to precipitation hardening—that is, to strengthening by the formation of very small particles of a second, or precipitate, phase. Control ofparticle size, and subsequently the strength, is accomplished by two heat treatments.For the second or precipitation treatment at constant temperature, strength in-creases with time to a maximum and decreases during overaging. This process is ac-celerated with rising temperature. The strengthening phenomenon is explained interms of an increased resistance to dislocation motion by lattice strains, which areestablished in the vicinity of these microscopically small precipitate particles.References •409 IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS Alloy steelAnnealingArtificial agingAustenitizingBrassBronzeCast ironCold workingCompacted graphite ironDrawingDuctile (nodular) ironExtrusionFerrous alloyForgingFull annealingPrecipitation heat treatmentProcess annealingRollingSolution heat treatmentSpecific strengthSpheroidizingStainless steelStress reliefTemper designationUpper critical temperatureWeldingWhite cast ironWrought alloyGray cast ironHardenabilityHigh-strength, low-alloy (HSLA) steel Hot workingJominy end-quench testLower critical temperatureMalleable ironNatural agingNonferrous alloyNormalizingOveragingPlain carbon steelPowder metallurgy (P/M)Precipitation hardening REFERENCES ASM Handbook, Vol.

WHY STUDY Structures and Properties of Ceramics ?1496T_c12_414-459 12/31/05 10:16 Page 4142nd REVISE PAGES12.1 INTRODUCTION Ceramic materials were discussed briefly in Chapter 1, which noted that they are inorganic and nonmetallic materials. Most ceramics are compounds between metal-lic and nonmetallic elements for which the interatomic bonds are either totallyionic, or predominantly ionic but having some covalent character. The term “ceramic” comes from the Greek word keramikos, which means “burnt stuff,” in- dicating that desirable properties of these materials are normally achieved througha high-temperature heat treatment process called firing. Up until the past 60 or so years, the most important materials in this class were termed the “traditional ceramics,” those for which the primary raw material is clay;products considered to be traditional ceramics are china, porcelain, bricks, tiles, and,in addition, glasses and high-temperature ceramics. Of late, significant progress hasbeen made in understanding the fundamental character of these materials and ofthe phenomena that occur in them that are responsible for their unique properties.Consequently, a new generation of these materials has evolved, and the term“ceramic” has taken on a much broader meaning. To one degree or another, thesenew materials have a rather dramatic effect on our lives; electronic, computer, com-munication, aerospace, and a host of other industries rely on their use. This chapter discusses the types of crystal structure and atomic point defect that are found in ceramic materials and, in addition, some of their mechanical char-acteristics. Applications and fabrication techniques for this class of materials aretreated in the next chapter. Ceramic Structures Because ceramics are composed of at least two elements, and often more, their crys-tal structures are generally more complex than those for metals.

for metals. The atomic bond-ing in these materials ranges from purely ionic to totally covalent; many ceramicsexhibit a combination of these two bonding types, the degree of ionic characterbeing dependent on the electronegativities of the atoms. Table 12.1 presents thepercent ionic character for several common ceramic materials; these values weredetermined using Equation 2.10 and the electronegativities in Figure 2.7. 12.2 CRYSTAL STRUCTURES For those ceramic materials for which the atomic bonding is predominantly ionic,the crystal structures may be thought of as being composed of electrically chargedLearning Objectives After careful study of this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1.Sketch/describe unit cells for sodium chloride,cesium chloride, zinc blende, diamond cubic,fluorite, and perovskite crystal structures.

The metallic ions, or cations, are positively charged, be- cause they have given up their valence electrons to the nonmetallic ions, or anions, which are negatively charged.

negatively charged. Two characteristics of the component ions in crystalline ceramic materials influence the crystal structure: the magnitude ofthe electrical charge on each of the component ions, and the relative sizes of thecations and anions. With regard to the first characteristic, the crystal must beelectrically neutral; that is, all the cation positive charges must be balanced byan equal number of anion negative charges. The chemical formula of a compoundindicates the ratio of cations to anions, or the composition that achieves thischarge balance. For example, in calcium fluoride, each calcium ion has a charge and associated with each fluorine ion is a single negative charge Thus, there must be twice as many as ions, which is reflected in the chemical formula The second criterion involves the sizes or ionic radii of the cations and an- ions, and respectively. Because the metallic elements give up electrons whenionized, cations are ordinarily smaller than anions, and, consequently, the ratio is less than unity. Each cation prefers to have as many nearest-neighbor an- ions as possible. The anions also desire a maximum number of cation nearestneighbors. Stable ceramic crystal structures form when those anions surrounding a cation are all in contact with that cation, as illustrated in Figure 12.1. The coordinationnumber (i.e., number of anion nearest neighbors for a cation) is related to thecation–anion radius ratio. For a specific coordination number, there is a critical orminimum ratio for which this cation–anion contact is established (Figure 12.1);this ratio may be determined from pure geometrical considerations (see ExampleProblem 12.1).r C/H11408rArC/H11408rArA, rCCaF2.Ca2/H11001F/H11002(F/H11002).

For ratios less than 0.155, the very small cation is bonded to two anions in a linear manner. If has a value between0.155 and 0.225, the coordination number for the cation is 3. This means each cationis surrounded by three anions in the form of a planar equilateral triangle, with thecation located in the center. The coordination number is 4 for between 0.225and 0.414; the cation is located at the center of a tetrahedron, with anions at eachof the four corners. For between 0.414 and 0.732, the cation may be thoughtof as being situated at the center of an octahedron surrounded by six anions, oner C/H11408rArC/H11408rArC/H11408rArC/H11408rArC/H11408rATable 12.2 Coordination Numbers and Geometries for Various Cation–Anion Radius Ratios ( ) Coordination Cation–Anion Coordination Number Radius Ratio Geometry 2 /H110210.155 3 0.155–0.225 4 0.225–0.414 6 0.414–0.732 8 0.732–1.0 Source: W.

the table. The coordination number is 8 for between 0.732 and 1.0, with anions at all corners of a cube and a cation positionedat the center. For a radius ratio greater than unity, the coordination number is 12.The most common coordination numbers for ceramic materials are 4, 6, and 8.Table 12.3 gives the ionic radii for several anions and cations that are common inceramic materials. It should be noted that the relationships between coordination number and cation–anion radii ratios (as noted in Table 12.2) are based on geometrical consid-erations and assuming “hard sphere” ions; therefore, these relationships are onlyapproximate, and there are exceptions. For example, some ceramic compounds with ratios greater than 0.414 in which the bonding is highly covalent (and direc- tional), have a coordination number of 4 (instead of 6). The size of an ion will depend on several factors. One of these is coordination number: ionic radius tends to increase as the number of nearest-neighbor ions ofopposite charge increases. Ionic radii given in Table 12.3 are for a coordination num-ber of 6. Therefore, the radius will be greater for a coordination number of 8 andless when the coordination number is 4. In addition, the charge on an ion will influence its radius. For example, from Table 12.3, the radii for and are 0.077 and 0.069 nm, respectively, whichvalues may be contrasted to the radius of an iron atom—viz. 0.124 nm. When anelectron is removed from an atom or ion, the remaining valence electrons becomemore tightly bound to the nucleus, which results in a decrease in ionic radius. Con-versely, ionic size increases when electrons are added to an atom or ion.

These are often referred to as AX compounds, where Adenotes the cation and X the anion. There are several different crystal structuresfor AX compounds; each is normally named after a common material that assumesthe particular structure. Rock Salt Structure Perhaps the most common AX crystal structure is the sodium chloride (NaCl), or rock salt, type. The coordination number for both cations and anions is 6, and therefore the cation–anion radius ratio is between approximately 0.414 and 0.732.A unit cell for this crystal structure (Figure 12.2) is generated from an FCC1496T_c12_414-459 12/31/05 10:16 Page 4192nd REVISE PAGESarrangement of anions with one cation situated at the cube center and one at the center of each of the 12 cube edges.

cube edges. An equivalent crystal structure results froma face-centered arrangement of cations. Thus, the rock salt crystal structure maybe thought of as two interpenetrating FCC lattices, one composed of the cations,the other of anions. Some of the common ceramic materials that form with this crystal structure are NaCl, MgO, MnS, LiF, and FeO. Cesium Chloride Structure Figure 12.3 shows a unit cell for the cesium chloride (CsCl) crystal structure; the coordination number is 8 for both ion types. The anions are located at each of thecorners of a cube, whereas the cube center is a single cation. Interchange of anionswith cations, and vice versa, produces the same crystal structure. This is nota BCC crystal structure because ions of two different kinds are involved. Zinc Blende Structure A third AX structure is one in which the coordination number is 4; that is, all ionsare tetrahedrally coordinated. This is called the zinc blende, or sphalerite, struc- ture, after the mineralogical term for zinc sulfide (ZnS). A unit cell is presented in420 •Chapter 12 / Structures and Properties of Ceramics Na+ Cl–Figure 12.2 A unit cell for the rock salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), crystal structure.

An equivalent structure resultsif Zn and S atom positions are reversed. Thus, each Zn atom is bonded to four Satoms, and vice versa.

vice versa. Most often the atomic bonding is highly covalent in compoundsexhibiting this crystal structure (Table 12.1), which include ZnS, ZnTe, and SiC.

Calcium ions are positioned at the centers of cubes, with fluorine ions atthe corners. The chemical formula shows that there are only half as many ionsas ions, and therefore the crystal structure would be similar to CsCl (Figure 12.3),except that only half the center cube positions are occupied by ions.

this classification. This material has a perovskite crystal structure and rather interesting electromechanical properties to be discussed later. At temperatures above the crystal structure is cubic. A unit cell of this structure is shown in Figure 12.6; ions are situated at all eight corners of the cube and a single is at the cube center, with ions located at the center of each of the six faces. Table 12.4 summarizes the rock salt, cesium chloride, zinc blende, fluorite, and perovskite crystal structures in terms of cation–anion ratios and coordination num-bers, and gives examples for each. Of course, many other ceramic crystal structuresare possible. Crystal Structures from the Close Packing of Anions It may be recalled (Section 3.12) that for metals, close-packed planes of atomsstacked on one another generate both FCC and HCP crystal structures. Similarly,a number of ceramic crystal structures may be considered in terms of close-packedplanes of ions, as well as unit cells. Ordinarily, the close-packed planes are composedof the large anions. As these planes are stacked atop each other, small interstitialsites are created between them in which the cations may reside.O 2/H11002Ti4/H11001Ba2/H11001(248/H11034F), 120/H11034CTi4/H11001Ba2/H11001(BaTiO3), AmBnXp.422 •Chapter 12 / Structures and Properties of Ceramics Ti4+ Ba2+ O2–Figure 12.6 A unit cell for the perovskite crystal structure.

Four atoms (three in one plane, and a single one in the adjacent plane) surround one type; this is termed a tetrahedral position, since straight lines drawn from the centers of the surrounding spheres form a four-sided tetrahedron. Theother site type in Figure 12.7, involves six ion spheres, three in each of the twoplanes. Because an octahedron is produced by joining these six sphere centers,this site is called an octahedral position. Thus, the coordination numbers for cations filling tetrahedral and octahedral positions are 4 and 6, respectively. Fur-thermore, for each of these anion spheres, one octahedral and two tetrahedralpositions will exist. Ceramic crystal structures of this type depend on two factors: (1) the stack- ing of the close-packed anion layers (both FCC and HCP arrangements are pos-sible, which correspond to and sequences, respectively), and (2) the manner in which the interstitial sites are filled with cations. For ex-ample, consider the rock salt crystal structure discussed above. The unit cell hascubic symmetry, and each cation has six ion nearest neighbors, asmay be verified from Figure 12.2. That is, the ion at the center has as near-est neighbors the six ions that reside at the centers of each of the cube faces. The crystal structure, having cubic symmetry, may be considered in terms of an FCCarray of close-packed planes of anions, and all planes are of the {111} type.

{111} type. Thecations reside in octahedral positions because they have as nearest neighbors sixanions. Furthermore, all octahedral positions are filled, since there is a single octa-hedral site per anion, and the ratio of anions to cations is 1:1. For this crystal struc-ture, the relationship between the unit cell and close-packed anion plane stackingschemes is illustrated in Figure 12.8. Other, but not all, ceramic crystal structures may be treated in a similar manner; included are the zinc blende and perovskite structures. The spinel structure is one of the types, which is found for magnesium aluminate or spinel With this structure, the ions form an FCC lattice, whereas ions fill tetra-hedral sites and reside in octahedral positions. Magnetic ceramics, or ferrites,have a crystal structure that is a slight variant of this spinel structure, and the mag-netic characteristics are affected by the occupancy of tetrahedral and octahedralpositions (see Section 20.5).

silicate classification. Rather than characterizing the crystalstructures of these materials in terms of unit cells, it is more convenient to use var-ious arrangements of an tetrahedron (Figure 12.9). Each atom of silicon isbonded to four oxygen atoms, which are situated at the corners of the tetrahedron;the silicon atom is positioned at the center. Since this is the basic unit of the sili-cates, it is often treated as a negatively charged entity. Often the silicates are not considered to be ionic because there is a significant covalent character to the interatomic Si–O bonds (Table 12.1), which are directionaland relatively strong. Regardless of the character of the Si–O bond, there is a /H110024 charge associated with every tetrahedron, since each of the four oxygen atomsrequires an extra electron to achieve a stable electronic structure. Various silicatestructures arise from the different ways in which the units can be combinedinto one-, two-, and three-dimensional arrangements. Silica Chemically, the most simple silicate material is silicon dioxide, or silica Structurally, it is a three-dimensional network that is generated when every cor-ner oxygen atom in each tetrahedron is shared by adjacent tetrahedra. Thus, thematerial is electrically neutral and all atoms have stable electronic structures.Under these circumstances the ratio of Si to O atoms is 1:2, as indicated by thechemical formula.

There are three primary polymorphic crystalline forms of sil- ica: quartz, cristobalite (Figure 12.10), and tridymite. Their structures are relativelycomplicated, and comparatively open; that is, the atoms are not closely packed to-gether. As a consequence, these crystalline silicas have relatively low densities; forexample, at room temperature quartz has a density of only The strengthof the Si–O interatomic bonds is reflected in a relatively high melting temperature, Silica Glasses Silica can also be made to exist as a noncrystalline solid or glass, having a high de-gree of atomic randomness, which is characteristic of the liquid; such a material iscalled fused silica, or vitreous silica. As with crystalline silica, the tetrahedron is the basic unit; beyond this structure, considerable disorder exists. The structuresfor crystalline and noncrystalline silica are compared schematically in Figure 3.22.Other oxides may also form glassy structures (and polyhe- dral oxide structures similar to that shown in Figure 12.9); these materials, as wellas are termed network formers. The common inorganic glasses that are used for containers, windows, and so on are silica glasses to which have been added other oxides such as CaO and These oxides do not form polyhedral networks. Rather, their cations are incorporated within and modify the network; for this reason, these oxideadditives are termed network modifiers. For example, Figure 12.11 is a schematic representation of the structure of a sodium–silicate glass. Still other oxides, suchas and while not network formers, substitute for silicon and becomepart of and stabilize the network; these are called intermediates.

called intermediates. From a practical perspective, the addition of these modifiers and intermediates lowers the meltingpoint and viscosity of a glass, and makes it easier to form at lower temperatures(Section 13.9). The Silicates For the various silicate minerals, one, two, or three of the corner oxygen atoms ofthe tetrahedra are shared by other tetrahedra to form some rather complexstructures. Some of these, represented in Figure 12.12, have formulas and so on; single-chain structures are also possible, as in Figure 12.12 e. Positively charged cations such as and serve two roles.

Simple Silicates Of these silicates, the most structurally simple ones involve isolated tetrahedra (Fig-ure 12.12a). For example, forsterite (Mg 2SiO 4) has the equivalent of two ions associated with each tetrahedron in such a way that every ion has six oxygennearest neighbors.

Electroneutrality is ordinarily established by a second planar sheet struc-ture having an excess of cations, which bond to these unbonded oxygen atoms fromthe Si 2O5sheet. Such materials are called the sheet or layered silicates, and their basic structure is characteristic of the clays and other minerals. One of the most common clay minerals, kaolinite, has a relatively simple two- layer silicate sheet structure.

sheet structure. Kaolinite clay has the formula Al 2(Si2O5)(OH) 4in which the silica tetrahedral layer, represented by (Si 2O5) is made electrically neu- tral by an adjacent layer. A single sheet of this structure is shown in Figure 12.14, which is exploded in the vertical direction to provide a better per-spective of the ion positions; the two distinct layers are indicated in the figure. Themidplane of anions consists of ions from the layer, as well as ions that are a part of the layer. Whereas the bonding within this two- layered sheet is strong and intermediate ionic-covalent, adjacent sheets are onlyloosely bound to one another by weak van der Waals forces. A crystal of kaolinite is made of a series of these double layers or sheets stacked parallel to each other, which form small flat plates typically less than in di-ameter and nearly hexagonal. The chapter-opening photograph for this chapter isan electron micrograph of kaolinite crystals at a high magnification, showing thehexagonal crystal plates some of which are piled one on top of the other. These silicate sheet structures are not confined to the clays; other minerals also in this group are talc and the micas [e.g., muscovite, which are important ceramic raw materials.

classification schemes. However, we choose to discuss thesematerials in this chapter since graphite, one of the polymorphic forms, is sometimesclassified as a ceramic, and, in addition, the crystal structure of diamond, another poly-morph, is similar to that of zinc blende, discussed in Section 12.2. Treatment of the car-bon materials will focus on the structures and characteristics of graphite, diamond, thefullerenes, and carbon nanotubes, and, in addition, on their current and potential uses. Diamond Diamond is a metastable carbon polymorph at room temperature and atmosphericpressure. Its crystal structure is a variant of the zinc blende, in which carbon atomsoccupy all positions (both Zn and S), as indicated in the unit cell shown in Fig-ure 12.15 (and also on the front cover of the book). Thus, each carbon bonds to fourother carbons, and these bonds are totally covalent. This is appropriately called thediamond cubic crystal structure, which is also found for other Group IVA elements in the periodic table [e.g., germanium, silicon, and gray tin, below The physical properties of diamond make it an extremely attractive material. It is extremely hard (the hardest known material) and has a very low electrical con-ductivity; these characteristics are due to its crystal structure and the strong inter-atomic covalent bonds. Furthermore, it has an unusually high thermal conductivityfor a nonmetallic material, is optically transparent in the visible and infrared re-gions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and has a high index of refraction. Rela-tively large diamond single crystals are used as gem stones. Industrially, diamondsare utilized to grind or cut other softer materials (Section 13.6). Techniques toproduce synthetic diamonds have been developed, beginning in the mid-1950s,that have been refined to the degree that today a large proportion of the indus trial- quality materials are man-made, in addition to some of those of gem quality.

Maximum film thicknesses are on the order of a millimeter. Furthermore,none of the films yet produced has the long-range crystalline regularity of natural13/H11034C (55/H11034F)].430 •Chapter 12 / Structures and Properties of Ceramics OH– O2–Al3+Si4+Anion midplaneAl2(OH)42+ Layer (Si2O5)2– LayerFigure 12.14 The structure of kaolinite clay.

These desirable properties have been and will continue tobe exploited so as to create new and better products. For example, the surfaces of drills,dies, bearings, knives, and other tools have been coated with diamond films to increasesurface hardness; some lenses and radomes have been made stronger while remainingtransparent by the application of diamond coatings; coatings have also been appliedto loudspeaker tweeters and to high-precision micrometers. Potential applications forthese films include application to the surface of machine components such as gears, tooptical recording heads and disks, and as substrates for semiconductor devices.

As a consequence of these weak interplanar bonds, interplanarcleavage is facile, which gives rise to the excellent lubricative properties of graphite.Also, the electrical conductivity is relatively high in crystallographic directions par-allel to the hexagonal sheets. Other desirable properties of graphite include the following: high strength and good chemical stability at elevated temperatures and in nonoxidizing atmospheres,high thermal conductivity, low coefficient of thermal expansion and high resistance tothermal shock, high adsorption of gases, and good machinability. Graphite is commonlyused as heating elements for electric furnaces, as electrodes for arc welding, in metal-lurgical crucibles, in casting molds for metal alloys and ceramics, for high-temperaturerefractories and insulations, in rocket nozzles, in chemical reactor vessels, for electricalcontacts, brushes and resistors, as electrodes in batteries, and in air purification devices.

Its structureconsists of a single sheet of graphite, rolled into atube, both ends of which are capped with fullerene hemispheres. This carbon nanotube is represented schematically in Figure 12.19. Thenano prefix denotes that tube diameters are on the order of a nanometer (i.e., 100 nm or less). Eachnanotube is a single molecule composed of mil-lions of atoms; the length of this molecule is muchgreater (on the order of thousands of timesgreater) than its diameter. Multiple-walled carbonnanotubes consisting of concentric cylinders havealso been found to exist. These nanotubes are extremely strong and stiff, and relatively ductile. For single-wallednanotubes, tensile strengths range between 50 and200 GPa (approximately an order of magnitudegreater than for carbon fibers); this is the strongestknown material. Elastic modulus values are on theorder of one tetrapascal [TPa (1 GPa)],with fracture strains between about 5% and 20%.Furthermore, nanotubes have relatively low den-sities.

low den-sities. On the basis of these properties, the carbonnanotube has been termed the “ultimate fiber”and is extremely promising as a reinforcement incomposite materials. Carbon nanotubes also have unique and struc- ture-sensitive electrical characteristics. Dependingon the orientation of the hexagonal units in thegraphene plane (i.e., tube wall) with the tube axis,the nanotube may behave electrically as either aTPa /H1100510 3C60metal or a semiconductor. It has been reportedthat flat-panel and full-color displays (i.e., TV andcomputer monitors) have been fabricated usingcarbon nanotubes as field emitters; these displaysshould be cheaper to produce and will have lowerpower requirements than CRT and liquid crystaldisplays.

Buckminster Fuller, who invented the geodesic dome; each is simply a molecular replica of such a dome,which is often referred to as “buckyball” for short.

for short. The term fullerene is used to denote the class of materials that are composed of this type of molecule. Diamond and graphite are what may be termed network solids, in that all of the carbon atoms form primary bonds with adjacent atoms throughout the entiretyof the solid. By way of contrast, the carbon atoms in buckminsterfullerene bond to-gether so as to form these spherical molecules. In the solid state, the units forma crystalline structure and pack together in a face-centered cubic array. As a pure crystalline solid, this material is electrically insulating. However, with proper impurity additions, it can be made highly conductive and semiconductive. 12.5 IMPERFECTIONS IN CERAMICS Atomic Point Defects Atomic defects involving host atoms may exist in ceramic compounds. As with met-als, both vacancies and interstitials are possible; however, since ceramic materialscontain ions of at least two kinds, defects for each ion type may occur. For exam-ple, in NaCl, Na interstitials and vacancies and Cl interstitials and vacancies mayexist. It is highly improbable that there would be appreciable concentrations ofanion interstitials. The anion is relatively large, and to fit into a small interstitialposition, substantial strains on the surrounding ions must be introduced. Anion andcation vacancies and a cation interstitial are represented in Figure 12.20. The expression defect structure is often used to designate the types and concentrations of atomic defects in ceramics. Because the atoms exist as chargedions, when defect structures are considered, conditions of electroneutrality must bemaintained. Electroneutrality is the state that exists when there are equal numbers of positive and negative charges from the ions.As a consequence, defects in ceramicsdo not occur alone. One such type of defect involves a cation–vacancy and acation–interstitial pair. This is called a Frenkel defect (Figure 12.21).

(Figure 12.21). It might be thought of as being formed by a cation leaving its normal position and moving intoan interstitial site. There is no change in charge because the cation maintains thesame positive charge as an interstitial.C 60C60C60 Cation interstitial Cation vacancy Anion vacancyFigure 12.20 Schematic representations of cation and anion vacancies and a cation interstitial.

This defect might be thought of as being created by removing one cation and one anion from the interior of the crystal and then placing them both at an exter-nal surface. Since both cations and anions have the same charge, and since for everyanion vacancy there exists a cation vacancy, the charge neutrality of the crystal ismaintained. The ratio of cations to anions is not altered by the formation of either a Frenkel or a Schottky defect. If no other defects are present, the material is said to be sto-ichiometric. Stoichiometry may be defined as a state for ionic compounds wherein there is the exact ratio of cations to anions as predicted by the chemical formula.For example, NaCl is stoichiometric if the ratio of ions to ions is exactly1:1. A ceramic compound is nonstoichiometric if there is any deviation from this exact ratio.

exact ratio. Nonstoichiometry may occur for some ceramic materials in which two valence (or ionic) states exist for one of the ion types. Iron oxide (wüstite, FeO) is one suchmaterial, for the iron can be present in both and states; the number ofeach of these ion types depends on temperature and the ambient oxygen pressure.The formation of an ion disrupts the electroneutrality of the crystal by intro-ducing an excess charge, which must be offset by some type of defect. This maybe accomplished by the formation of one vacancy (or the removal of two pos-itive charges) for every two ions that are formed (Figure 12.22).

For Frenkel defects, the number of cation-vacancy/cation-interstitial defect pairs ( ) depends on temperature according to the followingexpression: (12.2) Here is the energy required for the formation of each Frenkel defect, and N is the total number of lattice sites. (Also, as in previous discussions, kand T represent Boltzmann’s constant and the absolute temperature, respectively. )The factor 2 is present in the denominator of the exponential because two de-fects (a missing cation and an interstitial cation) are associated with each Frenkeldefect. Similarly, for Schottky defects, in an AX-type compound, the equilibrium num- ber ( ) is a function of temperature as (12.3) where represents the Schottky defect energy of formation.

Solid solutions of both substitutional and interstitial types are possible. Foran interstitial, the ionic radius of the impurity must be relatively small in compar-ison to the anion. Since there are both anions and cations, a substitutional impuritywill substitute for the host ion to which it is most similar in an electrical sense: ifthe impurity atom normally forms a cation in a ceramic material, it most probablywill substitute for a host cation. For example, in sodium chloride, impurity and ions would most likely substitute for and ions, respectively.

Companion Site).] 12.6 DIFFUSION IN IONIC MATERIALS For ionic compounds, the phenomenon of diffusion is more complicated than formetals inasmuch as it is necessary to consider the diffusive motion of two types ofions that have opposite charges. Diffusion in these materials usually occurs by avacancy mechanism (Figure 5.3 a). Also, as we noted in Section 12.5, in order to maintain charge neutrality in an ionic material, the following may be said aboutvacancies: (1) ion vacancies occur in pairs [as with Schottky defects (Figure 12.21)],(2) they form in nonstoichiometric compounds (Figure 12.22), and (3) they are cre-ated by substitutional impurity ions having different charge states than the host ions(Example Problem 12.5). In any event, associated with the diffusive motion of asingle ion is a transference of electrical charge. In order to maintain localized chargeneutrality in the vicinity of this moving ion, it is necessary that another species hav-ing an equal and opposite charge accompany the ion’s diffusive motion. Possiblecharged species include another vacancy, an impurity atom, or an electronic carrier[i.e., a free electron or hole (Section 18.6)]. It follows that the rate of diffusion ofMg 2/H11001Al2O3?

bearon them. As we discuss in Section 18.16, this ionic motion gives rise to an electriccurrent. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity is a function of the diffusion coef-ficient (Equation 18.23). Consequently, much of the diffusion data for ionic solidscome from electrical conductivity measurements. 12.7 CERAMIC PHASE DIAGRAMS Phase diagrams have been experimentally determined for a large number of ce-ramic systems. For binary or two-component phase diagrams, it is frequently thecase that the two components are compounds that share a common element, oftenoxygen. These diagrams may have configurations similar to metal–metal systems,and they are interpreted in the same way. For a review of the interpretation of phasediagrams, the reader is referred to Section 9.8. The System One of the relatively simple ceramic phase diagrams is that found for the aluminumoxide–chromium oxide system, Figure 12.24. This diagram has the same form as theisomorphous copper–nickel phase diagram (Figure 9.3 a), consisting of single liquid and single solid phase regions separated by a two-phase solid–liquid region havingthe shape of a blade.The solid solution is a substitutional one in which substitutes for and vice versa. It exists for all compositions below the melting point of inasmuch as both aluminum and chromium ions have thesame charge as well as similar radii (0.053 and 0.062 nm, respectively). Furthermore,both and have the same crystal structure.

There existsan intermediate phase, or better, a compound called spinel, which has the chemical formula (or – ). Even though spinel is a distinct compound [ofcomposition 50 mol% –50 mol% MgO (72 wt% –28 wt% MgO)], it isrepresented on the phase diagram as a single-phase field rather than as a vertical line,as for (Figure 9.20); that is, there is a range of compositions over which spinelis a stable compound. Thus, spinel is nonstoichiometric for other than the 50 mol% –50 mol% MgO composition. Furthermore, there is limited solubility of in MgO below about ( ) at the left-hand extremity of Figure 12.25, whichis due primarily to the differences in charge and radii of the and ions(0.072 versus 0.053 nm). For the same reasons, MgO is virtually insoluble in as evidenced by a lack of a terminal solid solution on the right-hand side of the phasediagram. Also, two eutectics are found, one on either side of the spinel phase field,and stoichiometric spinel melts congruently at about ( ).

A relatively large volume change accompanies this trans- formation, resulting in the formation of cracks that render a ceramic ware useless.This problem is overcome by “stabilizing” the zirconia by adding between about3 and 7 wt% CaO. Over this composition range and at temperatures above about both cubic and tetragonal phases will be present. Upon cooling to room temperature under normal cooling conditions, the monoclinic and phasesdo not form (as predicted from the phase diagram); consequently, the cubic andtetragonal phases are retained, and crack formation is circumvented.A zirconia ma-terial having a calcia content within the range cited above is termed a partially stabilized zirconia, or PSZ. Yttrium oxide ( ) and magnesium oxide are also used as stabilizing agents. Furthermore, for higher stabilizer contents, only the cu-bic phase may be retained at room temperature; such a material is fully stabilized.

The principal drawback is a dis-position to catastrophic fracture in a brittle manner with very little energy absorption. 12.8 BRITTLE FRACTURE OF CERAMICS At room temperature, both crystalline and noncrystalline ceramics almost alwaysfracture before any plastic deformation can occur in response to an applied tensileload.

The brittle fracture process consists of the formation and propagation of cracks through the cross section of material in a direction perpendicular to the appliedload. Crack growth in crystalline ceramics may be either transgranular (i.e., throughthe grains) or intergranular (i.e., along grain boundaries); for transgranular fracture,cracks propagate along specific crystallographic (or cleavage) planes, planes of highatomic density. The measured fracture strengths of ceramic materials are substantially lower than predicted by theory from interatomic bonding forces. This may be explained byvery small and omnipresent flaws in the material that serve as stress raisers—pointsat which the magnitude of an applied tensile stress is amplified. The degree of stressamplification depends on crack length and tip radius of curvature according to Equa-tion 8.1, being greatest for long and pointed flaws.These stress raisers may be minutesurface or interior cracks (microcracks), internal pores, and grain corners, which arevirtually impossible to eliminate or control. For example, even moisture and con-taminants in the atmosphere can introduce surface cracks in freshly drawn glassfibers; these cracks deleteriously affect the strength. A stress concentration at a flawtip can cause a crack to form, which may propagate until the eventual failure.

eventual failure. The measure of a ceramic material’s ability to resist fracture when a crack is present is specified in terms of fracture toughness. The plane strain fracture tough-ness as discussed in Section 8.5, is defined according to the expression (12.5) where Yis a dimensionless parameter or function that depends on both specimen and crack geometries, is the applied stress, and ais the length of a surface crack or half of the length of an internal crack. Crack propagation will not occur as long as the right-hand side of Equation 12.5 is less than the plane strain fracture toughness of the ma-terial. Plane strain fracture toughness values for ceramic materials are smaller than formetals; typically they are below 10 MPa (9 ksi ). Values of for severalceramic materials are included in Table 8.1 and Table B.5 of Appendix B. Under some circumstances, fracture of ceramic materials will occur by the slow propagation of cracks, when stresses are static in nature, and the right-hand side ofEquation 12.5 is less than This phenomenon is called static fatigue, or delayed fracture; use of the term “fatigue” is somewhat misleading inasmuch as fracture may occur in the absence of cyclic stresses (metal fatigue was discussed in Chapter 8).It has been observed that this type of fracture is especially sensitive to environ-mental conditions, specifically when moisture is present in the atmosphere. Rela-tive to mechanism, a stress–corrosion process probably occurs at the crack tips. Thatis, the combination of an applied tensile stress and atmospheric moisture at cracktips causes ionic bonds to rupture; this leads to a sharpening and lengthening of thecracks until, ultimately, one crack grows to a size capable of rapid propagation ac-cording to Equation 8.3. Furthermore, the duration of stress application precedingfracture diminishes with increasing stress. Consequently, when specifying the staticfatigue strength, the time of stress application should also be stipulated.

be stipulated. Silicateglasses are especially susceptible to this type of fracture; it has also been observedin other ceramic materials to include porcelain, portland cement, high-aluminaceramics, barium titanate, and silicon nitride. There is usually considerable variation and scatter in the fracture strength for many specimens of a specific brittle ceramic material.

This phenomenon may be explained by the dependence of fracture strength on the probability of the existence of a flawthat is capable of initiating a crack. This probability varies from specimen to specimenof the same material and depends on fabrication technique and any subsequent treat-ment. Specimen size or volume also influences fracture strength; the larger the speci-men, the greater is this flaw existence probability, and the lower the fracture strength. For compressive stresses, there is no stress amplification associated with any exis- tent flaws. For this reason, brittle ceramics display much higher strengths in compres-sion than in tension (on the order of a factor of 10), and they are generally utilizedwhen load conditions are compressive. Also, the fracture strength of a brittle ceramicmay be enhanced dramatically by imposing residual compressive stresses at its sur-face. One way this may be accomplished is by thermal tempering (see Section 13.9). Statistical theories have been developed that in conjunction with experimental data are used to determine the risk of fracture for a given material; a discussion ofthese is beyond the scope of the present treatment. However, due to the dispersionin the measured fracture strengths of brittle ceramic materials, average values andfactors of safety as discussed in Sections 6.11 and 6.12 are not normally employedfor design purposes.

design purposes. Fractography of Ceramics It is sometimes necessary to acquire information regarding the cause of a ceramicfracture so that measures may be taken to reduce the likelihood of future incidents.A failure analysis normally focuses on determination of the location, type, andsource of the crack-initiating flaw. A fractographic study (Section 8.3) is normallya part of such an analysis, which involves examining the path of crack propagationas well as microscopic features of the fracture surface. It is often possible to con-duct an investigation of this type using simple and inexpensive equipment—forexample, a magnifying glass, and/or a low-power stereo binocular optical microscope444 •Chapter 12 / Structures and Properties of Ceramics Frequency of fracture Strength (MPa)300 40060 80Strength (ksi) 100 120 500 600 700 800 9000.0000.0020.0040.0060.008Figure 12.28 The frequency distribution of observed fracturestrengths for a siliconnitride material.1496T_c12_414-459 12/6/05 20:13 Page 444REVISED PAGESin conjunction with a light source. When higher magnifications are required the scanning electron microscope is utilized. After nucleation, and during propagation, a crack accelerates until a critical (or terminal) velocity is achieved; for glass, this critical value is approximately one-half ofthe speed of sound. Upon reaching this critical velocity, a crack may branch (or bifur-cate), a process that may be successively repeated until a family of cracks is produced.Typical crack configurations for four common loading schemes are shown in Fig-ure 12.29. The site of nucleation can often be traced back to the point where a set ofcracks converges or comes together. Furthermore, rate of crack acceleration increaseswith increasing stress level; correspondingly degree of branching also increases withrising stress. For example, from experience we know that when a large rock strikes(and probably breaks) a window, more crack branching results [i.e., more and smallercracks form (or more broken fragments are produced)] than for a small pebble impact.

pebble impact. During propagation, a crack interacts with the microstructure of the material, with the stress, as well as with elastic waves that are generated; these interactions pro-duce distinctive features on the fracture surface. Furthermore, these features provideimportant information on where the crack initiated, and the source of the crack-producing defect. In addition, measurement of the approximate fracture-producingstress may be useful; stress magnitude is indicative of whether the ceramic piece wasexcessively weak, or the in-service stress was greater than anticipated. Several microscopic features normally found on the crack surfaces of failed ceramic pieces are shown in the schematic diagram of Figure 12.30 and also thephotomicrograph in Figure 12.31. The crack surface that formed during the initialacceleration stage of propagation is flat and smooth, and appropriately termed themirror region (Figure 12.30). For glass fractures, this mirror region is extremely flat and highly reflective; on the other hand, for polycrystalline ceramics, the flat mir-ror surfaces are rougher and have a granular texture. The outer perimeter of themirror region is roughly circular, with the crack origin at its center. Upon reaching its critical velocity, the crack begins to branch—that is, the crack surface changes propagation direction. At this time there is a roughening of the12.8 Brittle Fracture of Ceramics •445 BendingOriginOrigin Impact or point loading Internal pressureOrigin TorsionOrigin(a) (b) (c) (d)Figure 12.29 For brittle ceramic materials, schematic representations of crack originsand configurations that resultfrom (a) impact (point contact)loading, (b) bending, (c) torsionalloading, and (d) internal pressure.

The mist is a faint annular region just outside the mirror; it is often not discernible forpolycrystalline ceramic pieces.And beyond the mist is the hackle, which has an evenrougher texture. The hackle is composed of a set of striations or lines that radiateaway from the crack source in the direction of crack propagation; furthermore, theyintersect near the crack initiation site, and may be used to pinpoint its location. Qualitative information regarding the magnitude of the fracture-producing stress is available from measurement of the mirror radius ( in Figure 12.30). Thisradius is a function of the acceleration rate of a newly formed crack—that is, thegreater this acceleration rate, the sooner the crack reaches its critical velocity, andthe smaller the mirror radius.

mirror radius. Furthermore, the acceleration rate increases withstress level. Thus, as fracture stress level increases, the mirror radius decreases;experimentally it has been observed that (12.6) Here /H9268 fis the stress level at which fracture occurred. Elastic (sonic) waves are generated also during a fracture event, and the locus of intersections of these waves with a propagating crack front give rise to another type ofsurface feature known as a Wallner line. Wallner lines are arc shaped, and they pro- vide information regarding stress distributions and directions of crack propagation. 12.9 STRESS–STRAIN BEHAVIOR Flexural Strength The stress–strain behavior of brittle ceramics is not usually ascertained by a tensiletest as outlined in Section 6.2, for three reasons. First, it is difficult to prepare and testspecimens having the required geometry. Second, it is difficult to grip brittle materialswithout fracturing them; and third, ceramics fail after only about 0.1% strain, whichnecessitates that tensile specimens be perfectly aligned to avoid the presence of bendingstresses, which are not easily calculated. Therefore, a more suitable transverse bend-ing test is most frequently employed, in which a rod specimen having either a circularor rectangular cross section is bent until fracture using a three- or four-point loadingtechnique; 2the three-point loading scheme is illustrated in Figure 12.32. At the point of loading, the top surface of the specimen is placed in a state of compression, while thebottom surface is in tension. Stress is computed from the specimen thickness, the bend-ing moment, and the moment of inertia of the cross section; these parameters are notedin Figure 12.32 for rectangular and circular cross sections. The maximum tensile stress(as determined using these stress expressions) exists at the bottom specimen surfacedirectly below the point of load application. Since the tensile strengths of ceramics areabout one-tenth of their compressive strengths, and since fracture occurs on the tensilespecimen face, the flexure test is a reasonable substitute for the tensile test.

tensile test. The stress at fracture using this flexure test is known as the flexural strength, modulus of rupture, fracture strength, or the bend strength, an important mechani- cal parameter for brittle ceramics.

In addition, the magnitudeof flexural strength for a specific ceramic material will be greater than its fracturestrength measured from a tensile test. This phenomenon may be explained by dif-ferences in specimen volume that are exposed to tensile stresses: the entirety of atensile specimen is under tensile stress, whereas only some volume fraction of aflexural specimen is subjected to tensile stresses—those regions in the vicinity ofthe specimen surface opposite to the point of load application (see Figure 12.32). Elastic Behavior The elastic stress–strain behavior for ceramic materials using these flexure tests issimilar to the tensile test results for metals: a linear relationship exists betweenstress and strain.

and strain. Figure 12.33 compares the stress–strain behavior to fracture foraluminum oxide and glass. Again, the slope in the elastic region is the modulus ofelasticity; the range of moduli of elasticity for ceramic materials is between about70 and 500 GPa ( and psi), being slightly higher than for metals.Table 12.5 lists values for several ceramic materials. A more comprehensive tabu-lation is contained in Table B.2 of Appendix B. Also, from Figure 12.33 note thatneither material experiences plastic deformation prior to fracture. 12.10 MECHANISMS OF PLASTIC DEFORMATION Although at room temperature most ceramic materials suffer fracture before theonset of plastic deformation, a brief exploration into the possible mechanisms isworthwhile. Plastic deformation is different for crystalline and noncrystallineceramics; however, each is discussed. Crystalline Ceramics For crystalline ceramics, plastic deformation occurs, as with metals, by the motionof dislocations (Chapter 7). One reason for the hardness and brittleness of thesematerials is the difficulty of slip (or dislocation motion). For crystalline ceramic ma-terials for which the bonding is predominantly ionic, there are very few slip systems70/H1100310 610/H1100310612.10 Mechanisms of Plastic Deformation •449 40 30 20 10 0 0250 200 150 100 50 0 0.0004 0.0008 0.0012 StrainGlassAluminum oxide Stress (103 psi) Stress (MPa)Figure 12.33 Typical stress–strain behavior to fracture for aluminum oxide and glass.1496T_c12_414-459 12/6/05 20:13 Page 449REVISED PAGES(crystallographic planes and directions within those planes) along which disloca- tions may move. This is a consequence of the electrically charged nature of the ions.For slip in some directions, ions of like charge are brought into close proximity toone another; because of electrostatic repulsion, this mode of slip is very restricted,to the extent that plastic deformation in ceramics is rarely measurable at room tem-perature.

room tem-perature. By way of contrast, in metals, since all atoms are electrically neutral, con-siderably more slip systems are operable and, consequently, dislocation motion ismuch more facile. On the other hand, for ceramics in which the bonding is highly covalent, slip is also difficult and they are brittle for the following reasons: (1) the covalent bondsare relatively strong, (2) there are also limited numbers of slip systems, and (3) dis-location structures are complex. Noncrystalline Ceramics Plastic deformation does not occur by dislocation motion for noncrystalline ceramicsbecause there is no regular atomic structure. Rather, these materials deform by vis- cous flow, the same manner in which liquids deform; the rate of deformation is pro- portional to the applied stress. In response to an applied shear stress, atoms or ionsslide past one another by the breaking and reforming of interatomic bonds. How-ever, there is no prescribed manner or direction in which this occurs, as with dislo-cations. Viscous flow on a macroscopic scale is demonstrated in Figure 12.34. The characteristic property for viscous flow, viscosity, is a measure of a non- crystalline material’s resistance to deformation. For viscous flow in a liquid thatoriginates from shear stresses imposed by two flat and parallel plates, the viscosity is the ratio of the applied shear stress and the change in velocity dvwith dis- tance dyin a direction perpendicular to and away from the plates, or (12.8) This scheme is represented in Figure 12.34. The units for viscosity are poises (P) and pascal-seconds (Pa-s); 1 dyne-s/ cm 2, and 1 Pa-s N-s/m2. Conversion from one system of units to the other is according to Liquids have relatively low viscosities; for example, the viscosity of water at room temperature is about Pa-s. On the other hand, glasses have extremely large 10/H11002310 P /H110051 Pa-s/H110051P/H110051h/H11005t dv/H11408dy/H11005F/H11408A dv/H11408dyt h450 •Chapter 12 / Structures and Properties of Ceramics A vF yFigure 12.34 Representation of the viscous flow of a liquid or fluid glass in response to an appliedshear force.viscosity1496T_c12_414-459 12/6/05 20:13 Page 450REVISED PAGESviscosities at ambient temperatures, which is accounted for by strong interatomic bonding.

interatomic bonding. As the temperature is raised, the magnitude of the bonding is diminished,the sliding motion or flow of the atoms or ions is facilitated, and subsequently thereis an attendant decrease in viscosity. A discussion of the temperature dependenceof viscosity for glasses is deferred to Section 13.9. 12.11 MISCELLANEOUS MECHANICAL CONSIDERATIONS Influence of Porosity As discussed in Sections 13.10 and 13.11, for some ceramic fabrication techniques,the precursor material is in the form of a powder. Subsequent to compaction orforming of these powder particles into the desired shape, pores or void spaces willexist between the powder particles. During the ensuing heat treatment, much of thisporosity will be eliminated; however, it is often the case that this pore eliminationprocess is incomplete and some residual porosity will remain (Figure 13.17). Anyresidual porosity will have a deleterious influence on both the elastic properties andstrength. For example, it has been observed for some ceramic materials that themagnitude of the modulus of elasticity E decreases with volume fraction porosity Paccording to (12.9) where is the modulus of elasticity of the nonporous material. The influence ofvolume fraction porosity on the modulus of elasticity for aluminum oxide is shownin Figure 12.35; the curve represented in the figure is according to Equation 12.9. Porosity is deleterious to the flexural strength for two reasons: (1) pores reduce the cross-sectional area across which a load is applied, and (2) they also act as stressconcentrators—for an isolated spherical pore, an applied tensile stress is amplifiedby a factor of 2.The influence of porosity on strength is rather dramatic; for example,E 0E/H11005E011/H110021.9P /H110010.9P2212.11 Miscellaneous Mechanical Considerations •451 Dependence of modulus of elasticityon volume fractionporosity 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.060 50 40302010 0 Volume fraction porosity Modulus of elasticity (106 psi)Modulus of elasticity (GPa)400 300200100 0 Figure 12.35 The influence of porosity on the modulus of elasticity for aluminum oxide at room temperature.

The degree of the in-fluence of pore volume on flexural strength is demonstrated in Figure 12.36, againfor aluminum oxide. Experimentally it has been shown that the flexural strengthdecreases exponentially with volume fraction porosity ( P) as (12.10) In this expression and nare experimental constants.

In general, the time–deformation creep behavior of ceramics is similar to that of metals (Section 8.12);however, creep occurs at higher temperatures in ceramics. High-temperature com-pressive creep tests are conducted on ceramic materials to ascertain creep defor-mation as a function of temperature and stress level. SUMMARY Crystal Structures Both crystalline and noncrystalline states are possible for ceramics.The crystal struc- tures of those materials for which the atomic bonding is predominantly ionic aredetermined by the charge magnitude and the radius of each kind of ion. Some ofthe simpler crystal structures are described in terms of unit cells; several of thesewere discussed (rock salt, cesium chloride, zinc blende, diamond cubic, graphite,fluorite, perovskite, and spinel structures). Silicate Ceramics For the silicates, structure is more conveniently represented by means of intercon- necting tetrahedra.

necting tetrahedra. Relatively complex structures may result when other cations(e.g., ) and anions (e.g., ) are added. The structures of silica silica glass, and several of the simple and layered silicates were presented. Carbon The various forms of carbon—diamond, graphite, the fullerenes, and nanotubes— were also discussed. Diamond is a gem stone and, because of its hardness, is used tocut and grind softer materials. Furthermore, it is now being produced and utilized inthin films.The layered structure of graphite gives rise to its excellent lubricative prop-erties and a relatively high electrical conductivity. Graphite is also known for its highstrength and chemical stability at elevated temperatures and in nonoxidizing at-mospheres. Fullerenes exist as hollow and spherical molecules composed of 60 carbonatoms.The recently discovered carbon nanotubes have extraordinary properties: highstiffnesses and strengths, low densities, and unusual electrical characteristics. Struc-turally, a nanotube is a graphite cylinder with fullerene hemispheres on its ends. Imperfections in Ceramics With regard to atomic point defects, interstitials and vacancies for each anion and cation type are possible. These imperfections often occur in pairs as Frenkel andSchottky defects to ensure that crystal electroneutrality is maintained. Addition ofimpurity atoms may result in the formation of substitutional or interstitial solid so-lutions. Any charge imbalance created by the impurity ions may be compensatedby the generation of host ion vacancies or interstitials. Diffusion in Ionic Materials Diffusion in ionic materials normally occurs by a vacancy mechanism; localized charge neutrality is maintained by the coupled diffusive motion of a charged vacancyand some other charged entity.1SiO 22,OH/H11002Ca2/H11001, Mg2/H11001, Al3/H11001SiO44/H11002Summary •4531496T_c12_414-459 12/6/05 20:13 Page 453REVISED PAGESCeramic Phase Diagrams Phase diagrams for the – – – and – sys- tems were discussed.

were discussed. These diagrams are especially useful in assessing the high- temperature performance of ceramic materials. Brittle Fracture of Ceramics Stress–Strain Behavior At room temperature, virtually all ceramics are brittle. Microcracks, the presence of which is very difficult to control, result in amplification of applied tensile stressesand account for relatively low fracture strengths (flexural strengths). This amplifi-cation does not occur with compressive loads, and, consequently, ceramics arestronger in compression. Fractographic analysis of the fracture surface of a ceramicmaterial may reveal the location and source of the crack-producing flaw, as well asthe magnitude of the fracture stress. Representative strengths of ceramic materialsare determined by performing transverse bending tests to fracture. Mechanisms of Plastic Deformation Any plastic deformation of crystalline ceramics is a result of dislocation motion; the brittleness of these materials is explained, in part, by the limited number of opera-ble slip systems. The mode of plastic deformation for noncrystalline materials is byviscous flow; a material’s resistance to deformation is expressed as viscosity.At roomtemperature, the viscosities of many noncrystalline ceramics are extremely high. Miscellaneous Mechanical Considerations Many ceramic bodies contain residual porosity, which is deleterious to both their mod- uli of elasticity and fracture strengths. In addition to their inherent brittleness, ceramicmaterials are distinctively hard. Also, since these materials are frequently utilized atelevated temperatures and under applied loads, creep characteristics are important.Al 2O3 SiO2 CaO, ZrO2 Al2O3, MgO Cr2O3, Al2O3454 •Chapter 12 / Structures and Properties of Ceramics IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS AnionCationDefect structureElectroneutralityFlexural strengthFrenkel defectOctahedral positionSchottky defectStoichiometryTetrahedral positionViscosity REFERENCES Barsoum, M.

It is important for the engineer to realize how the applications and processing of ceramic materials areinfluenced by their mechanical and thermal proper-ties, such as hardness, brittleness, and high meltingtemperatures. For example, ceramic pieces normallycannot be fabricated using conventional metal-forming techniques (Chapter 11). As we discuss in thischapter, they are often formed using powder com-paction methods, and subsequently fired (i.e., heattreated).WHY STUDY Applications and Processing of Ceramics? 1496T_c13_460-488 12/31/05 10:18 Page 4602nd REVISE PAGESLearning Objectives After careful study of this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1.Describe the process that is used to produce glass–ceramics. 2.Name the two types of clay products, and thengive two examples of each. 3.Cite three important requirements that normallymust be met by refractory ceramics and abrasiveceramics. 4.Describe the mechanism by which cement hard-ens when water is added.5.Name and briefly describe four forming methods that are used to fabricate glass pieces. 6.Briefly describe and explain the procedure bywhich glass pieces are thermally tempered. 7.Briefly describe processes that occur duringthe drying and firing of clay-based ceramicware. 8.Briefly describe/diagram the sintering process ofpowder particle aggregates. 13.1 INTRODUCTION The preceding discussions of the properties of materials have demonstrated thatthere is a significant disparity between the physical characteristics of metals and ce-ramics. Consequently, these materials are utilized in totally different kinds of ap-plications and, in this regard, tend to complement each other and also the polymers.Most ceramic materials fall into an application-classification scheme that includesthe following groups: glasses, structural clay products, whitewares, refractories, abra-sives, cements, and the newly developed advanced ceramics.

advanced ceramics. Figure 13.1 presents ataxonomy of these several types; some discussion is devoted to each in this chapter. Types and Applications of Ceramics 13.2 GLASSES The glasses are a familiar group of ceramics; containers, lenses, and fiberglass rep-resent typical applications. As already mentioned, they are noncrystalline silicatescontaining other oxides, notably CaO, Na 2O, K 2O, and Al 2O3, which influence the glass properties. A typical soda–lime glass consists of approximately 70 wt% SiO 2, the balance being mainly Na 2O (soda) and CaO (lime). The compositions of sev- eral common glass materials are contained in Table 13.1. Possibly the two prime as-sets of these materials are their optical transparency and the relative ease with whichthey may be fabricated.

This process iscalled crystallization, and the product is a fine-grained polycrystalline material which is often called a glass–ceramic. The formation of these small glass-ceramic grains is, in a sense, a phase transformation, which involves nucleation and growthstages. As a consequence, the kinetics (i.e., the rate) of crystallization may be de-scribed using the same principles that were applied to phase transformations formetal systems in Section 10.3.

Section 10.3. For example, dependence of degree of transforma-tion on temperature and time may be expressed using isothermal transformationand continuous cooling transformation diagrams (Sections 10.5 and 10.6). The con-tinuous cooling transformation diagram for the crystallization of a lunar glass is pre-sented in Figure 13.2; the begin- and end-transformation curves on this plot haveTable 13.1 Compositions and Characteristics of Some of the Common Commercial Glasses Composition (wt%) Glass Type SiO 2Na2O CaO Al 2O3B2O3 Other Characteristics and Applications Fused silica /H1102299.5 High melting temperature, very low coefficient of expansion (thermally shock resistant) 96% Silica 96 4 Thermally shock and chemically (Vycor™) resistant—laboratory ware Borosilicate 81 3.5 2.5 13 Thermally shock and chemically (Pyrex™) resistant—ovenware Container 74 16 5 1 4MgO Low melting temperature, easily (soda–lime) worked, also durable Fiberglass 55 16 15 10 4MgO Easily drawn into fibers—glass–resin composites Optical flint 54 1 37PbO, High density and high index of 8K2O refraction—optical lenses Glass–ceramic 43.5 14 30 5.5 6.5TiO 2, Easily fabricated; strong; resists (Pyroceram™) 0.5As 2O3 thermal shock—ovenware crystallization glass–ceramic Temperature (ºC) Time (s) (logarithmic scale)11 0210410610810101012101470080090010001200 1100Crystallization begins Crystallization endsCritical cooling rateGlass-ceramicGlass100 ºC/min2 1Figure 13.2 Continuous cooling transformation diagram for the crystallization of a lunar glass (35.5 wt% SiO 2, 14.3 wt% TiO 2, 3.7 wt% Al 2O3, 23.5 wt% FeO, 11.6 wt% MgO, 11.1 wt% CaO, and 0.2 wt% Na2O).

Also included are two continuous cooling curves, which are labeled“1” and “2”; the cooling rate represented by curve 2 is much greater than that forcurve 1. As also noted on this plot, for the continuous cooling path represented bycurve 1, crystallization begins at its intersection with the upper curve, and progressesas time increases and temperature continues to decrease; upon crossing the lowercurve, all of the original glass has crystallized. The other cooling curve (curve 2) justmisses the nose of the crystallization start curve. It represents a critical cooling rate(for this glass, C/min)—that is, the minimum cooling rate for which the finalroom-temperature product is 100% glass; for cooling rates less than this, some glass-ceramic material will form. A nucleating agent (frequently titanium dioxide) is often added to the glass to promote crystallization. The presence of a nucleating agent shifts the begin and endtransformation curves to shorter times. Properties and Applications of Glass–Ceramics Glass-ceramic materials have been designed to have the following characteristics:relatively high mechanical strengths; low coefficients of thermal expansion (to avoidthermal shock); relatively high temperature capabilities; good dielectric properties(for electronic packaging applications); and good biological compatibility.

biological compatibility. Someglass–ceramics may be made optically transparent; others are opaque. Possibly themost attractive attribute of this class of materials is the ease with which they maybe fabricated; conventional glass-forming techniques may be used conveniently inthe mass production of nearly pore-free ware. Glass–ceramics are manufactured commercially under the trade names of Pyroceram™, Corningware™, Cercor™, and Vision™. The most common uses forthese materials are as ovenware, tableware, oven windows, and rangetops—primarilybecause of their strength and excellent resistance to thermal shock. They also serveas electrical insulators and as substrates for printed circuit boards, and are used forarchitectural cladding, and for heat exchangers and regenerators. A typical glass–ceramic is also included in Table 13.1, and the microstructure of a commercialmaterial is shown in the chapter opening photograph for this chapter.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 13.4 CLAY PRODUCTS One of the most widely used ceramic raw materials is clay. This inexpensive ingre-dient, found naturally in great abundance, often is used as mined without any up-grading of quality. Another reason for its popularity lies in the ease with which clayproducts may be formed; when mixed in the proper proportions, clay and waterform a plastic mass that is very amenable to shaping. The formed piece is dried toremove some of the moisture, after which it is fired at an elevated temperature toimprove its mechanical strength. Most of the clay-based products fall within two broad classifications: the structural clay products and the whitewares. Structural clay products include100/H1103413.4 Clay Products •463 structural clay product whiteware1496T_c13_460-488 12/7/05 10:19 Page 463REVISED PAGESbuilding bricks, tiles, and sewer pipes—applications in which structural integrity is important.

is important. The whiteware ceramics become white after the high-temperaturefiring. Included in this group are porcelain, pottery, tableware, china, and plumb- ing fixtures (sanitary ware). In addition to clay, many of these products alsocontain nonplastic ingredients, which influence the changes that take place dur-ing the drying and firing processes, and the characteristics of the finished piece(Section 13.10). 13.5 REFRACTORIES Another important class of ceramics that are utilized in large tonnages is therefractory ceramics. The salient properties of these materials include the capacity to withstand high temperatures without melting or decomposing, and the capacityto remain unreactive and inert when exposed to severe environments. In addition,the ability to provide thermal insulation is often an important consideration.Refractory materials are marketed in a variety of forms, but bricks are the mostcommon. Typical applications include furnace linings for metal refining, glassmanufacturing, metallurgical heat treatment, and power generation. Of course, the performance of a refractory ceramic, to a large degree, depends on its composition. On this basis, there are several classifications—namely, fire-clay, silica, basic, and special refractories. Compositions for a number of com-mercial refractories are listed in Table 13.2. For many commercial materials, theraw ingredients consist of both large (or grog) particles and fine particles, whichmay have different compositions. Upon firing, the fine particles normally are in-volved in the formation of a bonding phase, which is responsible for the increasedstrength of the brick; this phase may be predominantly either glassy or crystalline.The service temperature is normally below that at which the refractory piece wasfired. Porosity is one microstructural variable that must be controlled to produce a suitable refractory brick.

refractory brick. Strength, load-bearing capacity, and resistance to attackby corrosive materials all increase with porosity reduction. At the same time, ther-mal insulation characteristics and resistance to thermal shock are diminished. Ofcourse, the optimum porosity depends on the conditions of service. Fireclay Refractories The primary ingredients for the fireclay refractories are high-purity fireclays, alu-mina and silica mixtures usually containing between 25 and 45 wt% alumina.According to the SiO 2–Al 2O3phase diagram, Figure 12.27, over this composition464 •Chapter 13 / Applications and Processing of Ceramics firing Table 13.2 Compositions of Five Common Ceramic Refractory Materials ApparentComposition (wt%)Porosity Refractory Type Al 2O3 SiO 2 MgO Cr 2O3 Fe2O3 CaO TiO 2 (%) Fireclay 25–45 70–50 0–1 0–1 0–1 1–2 10–25 High-alumina fireclay 90–50 10–45 0–1 0–1 0–1 1–4 18–25 Silica 0.2 96.3 0.6 2.2 25 Periclase 1.0 3.0 90.0 0.3 3.0 2.5 22 Periclase–chrome ore 9.0 5.0 73.0 8.2 2.0 2.2 21 Source: From W.

silica (cristobalite). During refractory service use, the presence of a small amount of a liquid phase may be allowable without compromising mechanical in-tegrity. Above the fraction of liquid phase present will depend on refrac-tory composition. Upgrading the alumina content will increase the maximum servicetemperature, allowing for the formation of a small amount of liquid. Fireclay bricks are used principally in furnace construction, to confine hot at- mospheres, and to thermally insulate structural members from excessive temper-atures. For fireclay brick, strength is not ordinarily an important consideration,because support of structural loads is usually not required. Some control isnormally maintained over the dimensional accuracy and stability of the finishedproduct. Silica Refractories The prime ingredient for silica refractories, sometimes termed acid refractories, issilica. These materials, well known for their high-temperature load-bearing capac-ity, are commonly used in the arched roofs of steel- and glass-making furnaces; forthese applications, temperatures as high as may be realized. Un- der these conditions some small portion of the brick will actually exist as a liquid.The presence of even small concentrations of alumina has an adverse influenceon the performance of these refractories, which may be explained by the silica–alumina phase diagram, Figure 12.27. Since the eutectic composition (7.7 wt% Al 2O3) is very near the silica extremity of the phase diagram, even small additions of Al 2O3lower the liquidus temperature significantly, which means that substantial amounts of liquid may be present at temperatures in excess of Thus, the alumina content should be held to a minimum, normally to between 0.2and 1.0 wt%. These refractory materials are also resistant to slags that are rich in silica (called acid slags) and are often used as containment vessels for them.

for them. On the other hand,they are readily attacked by slags composed of a high proportion of CaO and/orMgO (basic slags), and contact with these oxide materials should be avoided. Basic Refractories The refractories that are rich in periclase, or magnesia (MgO), are termed basic;they may also contain calcium, chromium, and iron compounds. The presence ofsilica is deleterious to their high-temperature performance. Basic refractories areespecially resistant to attack by slags containing high concentrations of MgO andCaO, and find extensive use in some steel-making open hearth furnaces. Special Refractories There are yet other ceramic materials that are used for rather specialized refrac-tory applications. Some of these are relatively high-purity oxide materials, many ofwhich may be produced with very little porosity. Included in this group are alumina,silica, magnesia, beryllia (BeO), zirconia (ZrO 2), and mullite (3Al 2O3–2SiO 2). Oth- ers include carbide compounds, in addition to carbon and graphite. Silicon carbide(SiC) has been used for electrical resistance heating elements, as a crucible mate-rial, and in internal furnace components. Carbon and graphite are very refractory,but find limited application because they are susceptible to oxidation at tempera-tures in excess of about As would be expected, these specialized refractories are relatively expensive.(1470/H11034F). 800/H11034C(2910/H11034F). 1600/H11034C(3000/H11034F) 1650/H11034C1587/H11034C(2890/H11034F). 1587/H11034C13.5 Refractories •4651496T_c13_460-488 12/6/05 16:15 Page 465REVISED PAGESConcept Check 13.2 Upon consideration of the SiO 2–Al 2O3phase diagram (Figure 12.27) for the fol- lowing pair of compositions, which would you judge to be the more desirable refractory?

Therefore, the prime requisite for this group of materials ishardness or wear resistance; in addition, a high degree of toughness is essential toensure that the abrasive particles do not easily fracture. Furthermore, high tem-peratures may be produced from abrasive frictional forces, so some refractorinessis also desirable. Diamonds, both natural and synthetic, are utilized as abrasives; however, they are relatively expensive. The more common ceramic abrasives include silicon car-bide, tungsten carbide (WC), aluminum oxide (or corundum), and silica sand. Abrasives are used in several forms—bonded to grinding wheels, as coated abra- sives, and as loose grains. In the first case, the abrasive particles are bonded to awheel by means of a glassy ceramic or an organic resin.The surface structure shouldcontain some porosity; a continual flow of air currents or liquid coolants within thepores that surround the refractory grains prevents excessive heating. Figure 13.3shows the microstructure of a bonded abrasive, revealing abrasive grains, the bond-ing phase, and pores. Coated abrasives are those in which an abrasive powder is coated on some type of paper or cloth material; sandpaper is probably the most familiar example. Wood,metals, ceramics, and plastics are all frequently ground and polished using this formof abrasive.466 •Chapter 13 / Applications and Processing of Ceramics abrasive ceramic Figure 13.3 Photomicrograph of an aluminum oxide bonded ceramic abrasive.

Diamonds, corundum, silicon car- bide, and rouge (an iron oxide) are used in loose form over a variety of grain size ranges. 13.7 CEMENTS Several familiar ceramic materials are classified as inorganic cements: cement, plas- ter of paris, and lime, which, as a group, are produced in extremely large quantities.The characteristic feature of these materials is that when mixed with water, theyform a paste that subsequently sets and hardens. This trait is especially useful inthat solid and rigid structures having just about any shape may be expeditiouslyformed. Also, some of these materials act as a bonding phase that chemically bindsparticulate aggregates into a single cohesive structure. Under these circumstances,the role of the cement is similar to that of the glassy bonding phase that forms whenclay products and some refractory bricks are fired. One important difference, how-ever, is that the cementitious bond develops at room temperature. Of this group of materials, portland cement is consumed in the largest tonnages. It is produced by grinding and intimately mixing clay and lime-bearing minerals in theproper proportions, and then heating the mixture to about in a rotary kiln; this process, sometimes called calcination, produces physical and chemical changes in the raw materials.

raw materials. The resulting “clinker” product is then ground into a very finepowder to which is added a small amount of gypsum (CaSO 4–2H 2O) to retard the set- ting process. This product is portland cement. The properties of portland cement, in-cluding setting time and final strength, to a large degree depend on its composition. Several different constituents are found in portland cement, the principal ones being tricalcium silicate (3CaO–SiO 2) and dicalcium silicate (2CaO–SiO 2). The set- ting and hardening of this material result from relatively complicated hydrationreactions that occur among the various cement constituents and the water that isadded. For example, one hydration reaction involving dicalcium silicate is as follows: (13.1) where xis variable and depends on how much water is available. These hydrated products are in the form of complex gels or crystalline substances that form the ce-mentitious bond. Hydration reactions begin just as soon as water is added to thecement. These are first manifested as setting (i.e., the stiffening of the once-plasticpaste), which takes place soon after mixing, usually within several hours. Harden-ing of the mass follows as a result of further hydration, a relatively slow processthat may continue for as long as several years. It should be emphasized that theprocess by which cement hardens is not one of drying but, rather, of hydration inwhich water actually participates in a chemical bonding reaction. Portland cement is termed a hydraulic cement because its hardness develops by chemical reactions with water. It is used primarily in mortar and concrete tobind, into a cohesive mass, aggregates of inert particles (sand and/or gravel); theseare considered to be composite materials (see Section 16.2).

In particular, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties and property combi-nations unique to ceramics have been exploited in a host of new products; some ofthese are discussed in Chapters 18, 20, and 21. Furthermore, advanced ceramics areutilized in optical fiber communications systems, in microelectromechanical systems(MEMS), as ball bearings, and in applications that exploit the piezoelectric behav-ior of a number of ceramic materials. Each of these will now be discussed. Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) Microelectromechanical systems (abbreviated MEMS) are miniature “smart” sys- tems (Section 1.5) consisting of a multitude of mechanical devices that are inte-grated with large numbers of electrical elements on a substrate of silicon. Themechanical components are microsensors and microactuators. Microsensors collectenvironmental information by measuring mechanical, thermal, chemical, optical,and/or magnetic phenomena.The microelectronic components then process this sen-sory input, and subsequently render decisions that direct responses from the mi-croactuator devices—devices that perform such responses as positioning, moving,pumping, regulating, and filtering.These actuating devices include beams, pits, gears,motors, and membranes, which are of microscopic dimensions, on the order ofmicrons in size.

The processing of MEMS is virtually the same as that used for the production of silicon-based integrated circuits; this includes photolithographic, ion implanta-tion, etching, and deposition technologies, which are well established. In addition,some mechanical components are fabricated using micromachining techniques.MEMS components are very sophisticated, reliable, and miniscule in size. Further-more, since the above fabrication techniques involve batch operations, the MEMStechnology is very economical and cost effective. There are some limitations to the use of silicon in MEMS. Silicon has a low fracture toughness a relatively low softening temperature and is highly active to the presence of water and oxygen. Consequently, research is(600/H11034C), (/H110110.90 MPa 1m ),468 •Chapter 13 / Applications and Processing of Ceramics Figure 13.4 Scanning electron micrograph showing a linear rack gear reduction drive MEMS.

Those ceramic materials being considered are amor-phous silicon carbonitrides (silicon carbide–silicon nitride alloys), which may beproduced using metal organic precursors. In addition, fabrication of these ceramicMEMS will undoubtedly involve some of the traditional techniques discussed laterin this chapter.

this chapter. One example of a practical MEMS application is an accelerometer (accelerator/ decelerator sensor) that is used in the deployment of air-bag systems in automo-bile crashes. For this application the important microelectronic component is afree-standing microbeam. Compared to conventional air-bag systems, the MEMSunits are smaller, lighter, more reliable, and are produced at a considerable costreduction. Potential MEMS applications include electronic displays, data storage units, en- ergy conversion devices, chemical detectors (for hazardous chemical and biologicalagents, and drug screening), and microsystems for DNA amplification and identifi-cation. There are undoubtedly many yet unforeseen uses of this MEMS technology,which will have a profound impact on our society in the future; these will probablyovershadow the effects of microelectronic integrated circuits during the past threedecades. Optical Fibers One new and advanced ceramic material that is a critical component in our mod-ern optical communications systems is the optical fiber. The optical fiber is made of extremely high-purity silica, which must be free of even minute levels of con-taminants and other defects that absorb, scatter, and attenuate a light beam. Veryadvanced and sophisticated processing techniques have been developed to producefibers that meet the rigid restrictions required for this application. A discussion ofoptical fibers and their role in communications is provided in Section 21.14. Ceramic Ball Bearings Another new and interesting application of ceramic materials is in bearings. A bear-ing consists of balls and races that are in contact with and rub against one anotherwhen in use. In the past, both ball and race components traditionally have been madeof bearing steels that are very hard, extremely corrosion resistant, and may be pol-ished to a very smooth surface finish. Over the past decade or so silicon nitride(Si 3N4) balls have begun replacing steel balls in a number of applications, since sev- eral properties of Si 3N4make it a more desirable material.

desirable material. In most instances races are still made of steel, because its tensile strength is superior to that of silicon ni-tride. This combination of ceramic balls and steel races is termed a hybrid bearing. Since the density of Si 3N4is much less than steel (3.2 versus 7.8 g/cm3) hybrid bearings weigh less than conventional ones; thus, centrifugal loading is less in thehybrids, with the result that they may operate at higher speeds (20% to 40% higher).Furthermore, the modulus of elasticity of silicon nitride is higher than for bearingsteels (320 GPa versus about 200 GPa). Thus, the Si 3N4balls are more rigid, and experience lower deformations while in use, which leads to reductions in noise andvibration levels. Lifetimes for the hybrid bearings are greater than for steel bear-ings—normally three to five times greater. The longer life is a consequence of thehigher hardness of Si 3N4(75 to 80 HRC as compared to 58 to 64 HRC for bearing steels) and silicon nitride’s superior compressive strength (3000 MPa versus900 MPa), which results in lower wear rates. In addition, less heat is generated using13.8 Advanced Ceramics •469 optical fiber1496T_c13_460-488 12/6/05 16:15 Page 469REVISED PAGESthe hybrid bearings, because the coefficient of friction of Si 3N4is approximately 30% that of steel; this leads to an increase in grease life. In addition, lower lubri- cation levels are required than for the all-steel bearings. Ceramic materials are in-herently more corrosion resistant than metal alloys; thus, the silicon nitride ballsmay be used in more corrosive environments and at higher operating temperatures.Finally, because Si 3N4is an electrical insulator (bearing steels are much more elec- trically conductive), the ceramic bearings are immune to arcing damage.

arcing damage. Some of the applications that employ these hybrid bearings include inline skates, bicycles, electric motors, machine tool spindles, precision medical hand tools(e.g., high-speed dental drills and surgical saws), and textile, food processing, andchemical equipment. It should also be mentioned that all-ceramic bearings (having both ceramic races and balls) are now being utilized on a limited basis in applications where ahigh degree of corrosion resistance is required. A significant research effort has gone into the development of this silicon nitride bearing material. Some of the challenges that were encountered are as follows: pro-cessing/fabrication techniques to yield a pore-free material, fabrication of sphericalpieces that require a minimum of machining, and a polishing/lapping technique toproduce a smoother surface finish than steel balls.470 •Chapter 13 / Applications and Processing of Ceramics Piezoelectric CeramicsMATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE Afew ceramic materials (as well as somepolymers) exhibit the unusual phenomenon of piezoelectricity 1—electric polarization2(i.e., an electric field or voltage) is induced in the ceramiccrystal when a mechanical strain (dimensionalchange) is imposed on it. The inverse piezoelectriceffect is also displayed by this group of materials;that is, a mechanical strain results from the impo-sition of an electrical field. Piezoelectric materials may be utilized as transducers between electrical and mechanical en-ergies. One of the early uses of piezoelectric ce-ramics was in sonar, wherein underwater objects(e.g., submarines) are detected and their positionsdetermined using an ultrasonic emitting and re-ceiving system. A piezoelectric crystal is caused tooscillate by an electrical signal, which produceshigh-frequency mechanical vibrations that aretransmitted through the water. Upon encounter-ing an object, these signals are reflected back, andanother piezoelectric material receives this re-flected vibrational energy, which it then convertsback into an electrical signal.

electrical signal. Distance from theultrasonic source and reflecting body is deter-mined from the elapsed time between sending andreceiving events. More recently, the utilization of piezoelectric devices has grown dramatically as a consequenceof increases in automatization and consumer at-traction to modern sophisticated gadgets. Appli-cations that employ piezoelectric devices arefound in the automotive, computer, commercial/consumer, and medical sectors. Some of theseapplications are as follows: automotive—wheelbalances, seat belt buzzers, tread-wear indicators,keyless door entry, and airbag sensors; computer—microactuators for hard disks and notebooktransformers; commercial/consumer—ink-jet print-ing heads, strain gauges, ultrasonic welders, andsmoke detectors;medical—insulin pumps,ultrasonictherapy, and ultrasonic cataract-removal devices. Commonly used piezoelectric ceramics include barium titanate (BaTiO 3), lead titanate (PbTiO 3), lead zirconate–titanate (PZT) [Pb(Zr,Ti)O 3], and potassium niobate (KNbO 3).1 The piezoelectric phenomenon is described in more detail in Section 18.25. 2 Electric polarization (explained in Sections 18.19 and 18.20) is the alignment of electric dipoles (Section 2.7) in a common direction, which gives rise to an electricfield that is oriented in this same direction.1496T_c13_460-488 12/6/05 16:15 Page 470REVISED PAGESFabrication and Processing of Ceramics One chief concern in the application of ceramic materials is the method of fabri- cation. Many of the metal-forming operations discussed in Chapter 11 rely oncasting and/or techniques that involve some form of plastic deformation.

plastic deformation. Sinceceramic materials have relatively high melting temperatures, casting them is nor-mally impractical. Furthermore, in most instances the brittleness of these materi-als precludes deformation. Some ceramic pieces are formed from powders (orparticulate collections) that must ultimately be dried and fired. Glass shapesare formed at elevated temperatures from a fluid mass that becomes very vis-cous upon cooling. Cements are shaped by placing into forms a fluid paste thathardens and assumes a permanent set by virtue of chemical reactions. A taxo-nomical scheme for the several types of ceramic-forming techniques is presentedin Figure 13.5. 13.9 FABRICATION AND PROCESSING OF GLASSES AND GLASS–CERAMICS Glass Properties Before we discuss specific glass-forming techniques, some of the temperature-sensitive properties of glass materials must be presented. Glassy, or noncrystalline,materials do not solidify in the same sense as do those that are crystalline. Uponcooling, a glass becomes more and more viscous in a continuous manner withdecreasing temperature; there is no definite temperature at which the liquid trans-forms to a solid as with crystalline materials. In fact, one of the distinctions betweencrystalline and noncrystalline materials lies in the dependence of specific volume13.9 Fabrication and Processing of Glasses and Glass–Ceramics •471 Figure 13.5 A classification scheme for the ceramic- forming techniques discussed in this chapter.

soda–lime glasses. On the viscosity scale several specific points that are important in the fabrication and processing of glassesare labeled: 1.The melting point corresponds to the temperature at which the viscosity is 10 Pa-s (100 P); the glass is fluid enough to be considered a liquid. 2.The working point represents the temperature at which the viscosity is Pa-s ( P); the glass is easily deformed at this viscosity. 3.The softening point, the temperature at which the viscosity is Pa-s ( P), is the maximum temperature at which a glass piece may behandled without causing significant dimensional alterations. 4.The annealing point is the temperature at which the viscosity is Pa-s ( P); at this temperature, atomic diffusion is sufficiently rapid that anyresidual stresses may be removed within about 15 min. 5.The strain point corresponds to the temperature at which the viscosity be- comes Pa-s ( P); for temperatures below the strain point,fracture will occur before the onset of plastic deformation. The glass transi-tion temperature will be above the strain point. Most glass-forming operations are carried out within the working range— between the working and softening temperatures. Of course, the temperature at which each of these points occurs depends on glass composition. For example, the softening points for soda–lime and 96% silica glasses from Figure 13.7 are about 700 and (1300 and ), respectively.That is, forming operations may be carried out at significantly lower temperaturesfor the soda–lime glass. The formability of a glass is tailored to a large degree byits composition. Glass Forming Glass is produced by heating the raw materials to an elevated temperature abovewhich melting occurs. Most commercial glasses are of the silica–soda–lime variety;the silica is usually supplied as common quartz sand, whereas Na 2O and CaO are added as soda ash (Na 2CO 3) and limestone (CaCO 3).

(CaCO 3). For most applications, espe- cially when optical transparency is important, it is essential that the glass productbe homogeneous and pore free. Homogeneity is achieved by complete melting andmixing of the raw ingredients. Porosity results from small gas bubbles that are pro-duced; these must be absorbed into the melt or otherwise eliminated, which requiresproper adjustment of the viscosity of the molten material. Four different forming methods are used to fabricate glass products: pressing, blowing, drawing, and fiber forming. Pressing is used in the fabrication of relativelythick-walled pieces such as plates and dishes. The glass piece is formed by pressureapplication in a graphite-coated cast iron mold having the desired shape; the moldis ordinarily heated to ensure an even surface. Although some glass blowing is done by hand, especially for art objects, the process has been completely automated for the production of glass jars, bottles, andlight bulbs. The several steps involved in one such technique are illustrated in Fig-ure 13.8. From a raw gob of glass, a parison, or temporary shape, is formed by me- chanical pressing in a mold. This piece is inserted into a finishing or blow mold andforced to conform to the mold contours by the pressure created from a blast of air. Drawing is used to form long glass pieces such as sheet, rod, tubing, and fibers, which have a constant cross section. One process by which sheet glass is formed is2825/H11034F 1550/H11034C3/H1100310 143/H110031013101310124/H110031074/H1100310610410313.9 Fabrication and Processing of Glasses and Glass–Ceramics •473 melting point working point softening point annealing point strain point1496T_c13_460-488 12/6/05 16:15 Page 473REVISED PAGESillustrated in Figure 13.9; it may also be fabricated by hot rolling.

hot rolling. Flatness and the surface finish may be improved significantly by floating the sheet on a bath of moltentin at an elevated temperature; the piece is slowly cooled and subsequently heattreated by annealing. Continuous glass fibers are formed in a rather sophisticated drawing operation. The molten glass is contained in a platinum heating chamber. Fibers are formed bydrawing the molten glass through many small orifices at the chamber base.The glassviscosity, which is critical, is controlled by chamber and orifice temperatures. Heat Treating Glasses Annealing When a ceramic material is cooled from an elevated temperature, internal stresses, called thermal stresses, may be introduced as a result of the difference in coolingrate and thermal contraction between the surface and interior regions.These thermal474 •Chapter 13 / Applications and Processing of Ceramics Pressing operationGob Parison mold Suspended parisonFinishing moldCompressed airFigure 13.8 The press- and-blow technique for producing a glass bottle.

Normally, attempts are made to avoid thermal stresses, whichmay be accomplished by cooling the piece at a sufficiently slow rate. Once suchstresses have been introduced, however, elimination, or at least a reduction in theirmagnitude, is possible by an annealing heat treatment in which the glassware isheated to the annealing point, then slowly cooled to room temperature.

room temperature. Glass Tempering The strength of a glass piece may be enhanced by intentionally inducing compres-sive residual surface stresses. This can be accomplished by a heat treatment proce-dure called thermal tempering. With this technique, the glassware is heated to a temperature above the glass transition region yet below the softening point. It isthen cooled to room temperature in a jet of air or, in some cases, an oil bath. Theresidual stresses arise from differences in cooling rates for surface and interior re-gions. Initially, the surface cools more rapidly and, once having dropped to a tem-perature below the strain point, becomes rigid. At this time, the interior, havingcooled less rapidly, is at a higher temperature (above the strain point) and, there-fore, is still plastic. With continued cooling, the interior attempts to contract to agreater degree than the now rigid exterior will allow. Thus, the inside tends to drawin the outside, or to impose inward radial stresses. As a consequence, after the glasspiece has cooled to room temperature, it sustains compressive stresses on the sur-face, with tensile stresses at interior regions. The room-temperature stress distribu-tion over a cross section of a glass plate is represented schematically in Figure 13.10. The failure of ceramic materials almost always results from a crack that is ini- tiated at the surface by an applied tensile stress. To cause fracture of a temperedglass piece, the magnitude of an externally applied tensile stress must be greatenough to first overcome the residual compressive surface stress and, in addition,to stress the surface in tension sufficiently to initiate a crack, which may then prop-agate. For an untempered glass, a crack will be introduced at a lower external stresslevel, and, consequently, the fracture strength will be smaller. Tempered glass is used for applications in which high strength is important; these include large doors and eyeglass lenses.13.9 Fabrication and Processing of Glasses and Glass–Ceramics •475 thermal shock thermal tempering Stress (103 psi) 120 120 80 80 40 40 020 20 10 10 0 Stress (MPa) Compression TensionFigure 13.10 Room-temperature residual stress distribution over the cross section of a tempered glass plate.

Why? [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Fabrication and Heat Treating of Glass–Ceramics The first stage in the fabrication of a glass-ceramic ware is forming it into the de-sired shape as a glass. Forming techniques used are the same as for glass pieces, asdescribed previously—viz. pressing and drawing. Conversion of the glass into aglass–ceramic (i.e., crystallation, Section 13.3) is accomplished by appropriate heattreatments. One such set of heat treatments for a Li 2O–Al 2O3–SiO 2glass–ceramic is detailed in the time-versus-temperature plot of Figure 13.11. After melting andforming operations, nucleation and growth of the crystalline phase particles arecarried out isothermally at two different temperatures. 13.10 FABRICATION AND PROCESSING OF CLAY PRODUCTS As Section 13.4 noted, this class of materials includes the structural clay productsand the whitewares. In addition to clay, many of these products also contain otheringredients. After having been formed, pieces most often must be subjected to dry-ing and firing operations; each of the ingredients influences the changes that takeplace during these processes and the characteristics of the finished piece. The Characteristics of Clay The clay minerals play two very important roles in ceramic bodies.

ceramic bodies. First, when wa-ter is added, they become very plastic, a condition termed hydroplasticity. This prop- erty is very important in forming operations, as discussed below. In addition, clayfuses or melts over a range of temperatures; thus, a dense and strong ceramic piecemay be produced during firing without complete melting such that the desired shape476 •Chapter 13 / Applications and Processing of Ceramics 1600 1250 900 800650Working pt Softening pt Annealing pt TimeMelting Forming NucleationGrowthViscosity (Pa-s)T(°C) ~2.5 × 1013~4 × 107~103 Figure 13.11 Typical time-versus-temperature processing cycle for a Li 2O–Al 2O3–SiO 2 glass–ceramic.

Reprinted by permission of John Wiley & Sons, Inc.)1496T_c13_460-488 12/6/05 16:15 Page 476REVISED PAGESis maintained. This fusion temperature range, of course, depends on the composi- tion of the clay. Clays are aluminosilicates, being composed of alumina (Al 2O3) and silica (SiO 2), that contain chemically bound water. They have a broad range of physical characteristics, chemical compositions, and structures; common impurities includecompounds (usually oxides) of barium, calcium, sodium, potassium, and iron, andalso some organic matter. Crystal structures for the clay minerals are relativelycomplicated; however, one prevailing characteristic is a layered structure. Themost common clay minerals that are of interest have what is called the kaolinitestructure.

the kaolinitestructure. Kaolinite clay [Al 2(Si2O5)(OH) 4] has the crystal structure shown in Fig- ure 12.14. When water is added, the water molecules fit in between these layeredsheets and form a thin film around the clay particles. The particles are thus free tomove over one another, which accounts for the resulting plasticity of the water–claymixture. Compositions of Clay Products In addition to clay, many of these products (in particular the whitewares) also con-tain some nonplastic ingredients; the nonclay minerals include flint, or finely groundquartz, and a flux such as feldspar. 3The quartz is used primarily as a filler mate- rial, being inexpensive, relatively hard, and chemically unreactive. It experiences lit-tle change during high-temperature heat treatment because it has a high meltingtemperature; when melted, however, quartz has the ability to form a glass. When mixed with clay, a flux forms a glass that has a relatively low melting point. The feldspars are some of the more common fluxing agents; they are a groupof aluminosilicate materials that contain K /H11001,N a/H11001, and Ca2/H11001ions. As would be expected, the changes that take place during drying and firing processes, and also the characteristics of the finished piece, are influenced by theproportions of these three constituents: clay, quartz, and flux. A typical porcelainmight contain approximately 50% clay, 25% quartz, and 25% feldspar. Fabrication Techniques The as-mined raw materials usually have to go through a milling or grinding oper-ation in which particle size is reduced; this is followed by screening or sizing to yielda powdered product having a desired range of particle sizes. For multicomponentsystems, powders must be thoroughly mixed with water and perhaps other ingredi-ents to give flow characteristics that are compatible with the particular formingtechnique.

particular formingtechnique. The formed piece must have sufficient mechanical strength to remain in-tact during transporting, drying, and firing operations. Two common shaping tech-niques are utilized for forming clay-based compositions: hydroplastic forming and slip casting. Hydroplastic Forming As mentioned above, clay minerals, when mixed with water, become highly plasticand pliable and may be molded without cracking; however, they have extremelylow yield strengths.The consistency (water–clay ratio) of the hydroplastic mass mustgive a yield strength sufficient to permit a formed ware to maintain its shape dur-ing handling and drying.13.10 Fabrication and Processing of Clay Products •477 3 Flux, in the context of clay products, is a substance that promotes the formation of a glassy phase during the firing heat treatment.hydroplastic forming slip casting1496T_c13_460-488 12/6/05 16:15 Page 477REVISED PAGESThe most common hydroplastic forming technique is extrusion, in which a stiff plastic ceramic mass is forced through a die orifice having the desired cross-sectional geometry; it is similar to the extrusion of metals (Figure 11.8 c). Brick, pipe, ceramic blocks, and tiles are all commonly fabricated using hydroplastic forming. Usuallythe plastic ceramic is forced through the die by means of a motor-driven auger, andoften air is removed in a vacuum chamber to enhance the density. Hollow internalcolumns in the extruded piece (e.g., building brick) are formed by inserts situatedwithin the die. Slip Casting Another forming process used for clay-based compositions is slip casting. A slip isa suspension of clay and/or other nonplastic materials in water. When poured intoa porous mold (commonly made of plastic of paris), water from the slip is absorbedinto the mold, leaving behind a solid layer on the mold wall the thickness of whichdepends on the time.

the time. This process may be continued until the entire mold cavitybecomes solid (solid casting), as demonstrated in Figure 13.12 a. Or it may be ter- minated when the solid shell wall reaches the desired thickness, by inverting themold and pouring out the excess slip; this is termed drain casting (Figure 13.12 b). As the cast piece dries and shrinks, it will pull away (or release) from the mold wall;at this time the mold may be disassembled and the cast piece removed. The nature of the slip is extremely important; it must have a high specific grav- ity and yet be very fluid and pourable. These characteristics depend on the solid-to-water ratio and other agents that are added. A satisfactory casting rate is anessential requirement. In addition, the cast piece must be free of bubbles, and itmust have a low drying shrinkage and a relatively high strength.478 •Chapter 13 / Applications and Processing of Ceramics Slip poured into mold Slip poured into moldWater absorbed Finished piece Draining mold Top trimmedFinished piece(a) (b)Figure 13.12 The steps in (a) solid and (b) drain slip castingusing a plaster of parismold.

Normally, plaster of paris, which is economical, relatively easy to fabricate into intricate shapes, and reusable, is used as the mold material. Most molds are multipiece items thatmust be assembled before casting. Also, the mold porosity may be varied to controlthe casting rate.The rather complex ceramic shapes that may be produced by meansof slip casting include sanitary lavatory ware, art objects, and specialized scientificlaboratory ware such as ceramic tubes.

ceramic tubes. Drying and Firing A ceramic piece that has been formed hydroplastically or by slip casting retains sig-nificant porosity and insufficient strength for most practical applications. In addi-tion, it may still contain some liquid (e.g., water), which was added to assist in theforming operation. This liquid is removed in a drying process; density and strengthare enhanced as a result of a high-temperature heat treatment or firing procedure.A body that has been formed and dried but not fired is termed green. Drying and firing techniques are critical inasmuch as defects that ordinarily render the wareuseless (e.g., warpage, distortion, and cracks) may be introduced during the opera-tion. These defects normally result from stresses that are set up from nonuniformshrinkage. Drying As a clay-based ceramic body dries, it also experiences some shrinkage. In the earlystages of drying the clay particles are virtually surrounded by and separated fromone another by a thin film of water. As drying progresses and water is removed, theinterparticle separation decreases, which is manifested as shrinkage (Figure 13.13).During drying it is critical to control the rate of water removal. Drying at interiorregions of a body is accomplished by the diffusion of water molecules to the sur-face where evaporation occurs. If the rate of evaporation is greater than the rateof diffusion, the surface will dry (and as a consequence shrink) more rapidly thanthe interior, with a high probability of the formation of the aforementioned defects.The rate of surface evaporation should be diminished to, at most, the rate of waterdiffusion; evaporation rate may be controlled by temperature, humidity, and the rateof airflow. Other factors also influence shrinkage. One of these is body thickness; nonuniform shrinkage and defect formation are more pronounced in thick piecesthan in thin ones.

Clay particle size also has an influence; shrink- age is enhanced as the particle size is decreased. To minimize shrinkage, the sizeof the particles may be increased, or nonplastic materials having relatively largeparticles may be added to the clay. Microwave energy may also be used to dry ceramic wares. One advantage of this technique is that the high temperatures used in conventional methods areavoided; drying temperatures may be kept to below This is important because the drying of some temperature-sensitive materials should be kept as lowas possible. Concept Check 13.5 Thick ceramic wares are more likely to crack upon drying than thin wares. Why isthis so? [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Firing After drying, a body is usually fired at a temperature between 900 and (1650and ); the firing temperature depends on the composition and desiredproperties of the finished piece. During the firing operation, the density is furtherincreased (with an attendant decrease in porosity) and the mechanical strength isenhanced. When clay-based materials are heated to elevated temperatures, some rather complex and involved reactions occur. One of these is vitrification, the gradual formation of a liquid glass that flows into and fills some of the pore volume.

pore volume. Thedegree of vitrification depends on firing temperature and time, as well as the com-position of the body. The temperature at which the liquid phase forms is loweredby the addition of fluxing agents such as feldspar. This fused phase flows aroundthe remaining unmelted particles and fills in the pores as a result of surface tensionforces (or capillary action); shrinkage also accompanies this process. Upon cooling,this fused phase forms a glassy matrix that results in a dense, strong body. Thus, thefinal microstructure consists of the vitrified phase, any unreacted quartz particles,and some porosity. Figure 13.14 is a scanning electron micrograph of a fired porce-lain in which may be seen these microstructural elements. The degree of vitrification, of course, controls the room-temperature proper- ties of the ceramic ware; strength, durability, and density are all enhanced as it in-creases. The firing temperature determines the extent to which vitrification occurs;that is, vitrification increases as the firing temperature is raised. Building bricks areordinarily fired around and are relatively porous. On the other hand, firing of highly vitrified porcelain, which borders on being optically translucent,takes place at much higher temperatures. Complete vitrification is avoided duringfiring, since a body becomes too soft and will collapse.

clay products. Another important and commonly used methodthat warrants a brief treatment is powder pressing. Powder pressing, the ceramicanalogue to powder metallurgy, is used to fabricate both clay and nonclay compo-sitions, including electronic and magnetic ceramics as well as some refractory brickproducts. In essence, a powdered mass, usually containing a small amount of wateror other binder, is compacted into the desired shape by pressure. The degree ofcompaction is maximized and fraction of void space is minimized by using coarseand fine particles mixed in appropriate proportions. There is no plastic deforma-tion of the particles during compaction, as there may be with metal powders. Onefunction of the binder is to lubricate the powder particles as they move past oneanother in the compaction process. There are three basic powder-pressing procedures: uniaxial, isostatic (or hy- drostatic), and hot pressing. For uniaxial pressing, the powder is compacted in ametal die by pressure that is applied in a single direction. The formed piece takeson the configuration of die and platens through which the pressure is applied. Thismethod is confined to shapes that are relatively simple; however, production rates13.11 Powder Pressing •481 Crack in quartz grain Pore Mullite needlesFeldspar grainQuartz grain Glassy (rim) phase Figure 13.14 Scanning electron micrograph of a fired porcelain specimen (etched 15 s, 10% HF) in which may be seen the following features: quartz grains (large dark particles), which are surrounded by dark glassy solution rims; partially dissolved feldspar regions (smallunfeatured areas); mullite needles; and pores (dark holes with white border regions).

The steps involved in one technique are illustrated in Figure 13.15. For isostatic pressing, the powdered material is contained in a rubber envelope and the pressure is applied by a fluid, isostatically (i.e., it has the same magnitudein all directions). More complicated shapes are possible than with uniaxial press-ing; however, the isostatic technique is more time consuming and expensive. For both uniaxial and isostatic procedures, a firing operation is required after the pressing operation. During firing the formed piece shrinks, and experiences areduction of porosity and an improvement in mechanical integrity. These changesoccur by the coalescence of the powder particles into a more dense mass in aprocess termed sintering. The mechanism of sintering is schematically illustrated in Figure 13.16. After pressing, many of the powder particles touch one another(Figure 13.16 a). During the initial sintering stage, necks form along the contact re- gions between adjacent particles; in addition, a grain boundary forms within eachneck, and every interstice between particles becomes a pore (Figure 13.16 b). As sintering progresses, the pores become smaller and more spherical in shape (Fig-ure 13.16 c).A scanning electron micrograph of a sintered alumina material is shown in Figure 13.17. The driving force for sintering is the reduction in total particle sur-face area; surface energies are larger in magnitude than grain boundary energies.Sintering is carried out below the melting temperature so that a liquid phase isnormally not present.

not present. Mass transport necessary to effect the changes shown in Fig-ure 13.16 is accomplished by atomic diffusion from the bulk particles to the neckregions. With hot pressing, the powder pressing and heat treatment are performed si- multaneously—the powder aggregate is compacted at an elevated temperature. Theprocedure is used for materials that do not form a liquid phase except at very highand impractical temperatures; in addition, it is utilized when high densities without482 •Chapter 13 / Applications and Processing of Ceramics (a) (b) (d) (c)Figure 13.15 Schematic representation of the steps in uniaxial powder pressing.

As the name implies, thin sheets of a flexible tape are produced by meansof a casting process. These sheets are prepared from slips, in many respects similarto those that are employed for slip casting (Section 13.10). This type of slip consistsof a suspension of ceramic particles in an organic liquid that also contains bindersand plasticizers that are incorporated to impart strength and flexibility to the casttape. De-airing in a vacuum may also be necessary to remove any entrapped air orsolvent vapor bubbles, which may act as crack-initiation sites in the finished piece.The actual tape is formed by pouring the slip onto a flat surface (of stainless steel,glass, a polymeric film, or paper); a doctor blade spreads the slip into a thin tape ofuniform thickness, as shown schematically in Figure 13.18. In the drying process,volatile slip components are removed by evaporation; this green product is a flex-ible tape that may be cut or into which holes may be punched prior to a firing op-eration. Tape thicknesses normally range between 0.1 and 2 mm (0.004 to 0.08 in. ).Tape casting is widely used in the production of ceramic substrates that are usedfor integrated circuits and for multilayered capacitors.

multilayered capacitors. Cementation is also considered to be a ceramic fabrication process (Figure 13.5). The cement material, when mixed with water, forms a paste that, after being fashionedinto a desired shape, subsequently hardens as a result of complex chemical reactions.Cements and the cementation process were discussed briefly in Section 13.7. SUMMARY Glasses Glass–Ceramics This chapter began by discussing the various types of ceramic materials. The famil- iar glass materials are noncrystalline silicates that contain other oxides; the mostdesirable trait of these materials is their optical transparency. Glass–ceramics areinitially fabricated as a glass, then crystallized. Clay Products Clay is the principal component of the whitewares and structural clay products. Other ingredients may be added, such as feldspar and quartz, which influence thechanges that occur during firing.484 •Chapter 13 / Applications and Processing of Ceramics Slip source Doctor blade Reel of carrier filmSupport structureWarm air source Take-up reelFigure 13.18 Schematic diagram showing the tape-casting process using adoctor blade.

On the basis of composition and application, the four mainsubdivisions are fireclay, silica, basic, and special. Abrasives The abrasive ceramics, being hard and tough, are utilized to cut, grind, and polish other softer materials.

softer materials. Diamond, silicon carbide, tungsten carbide, corundum, andsilica sand are the most common examples. The abrasives may be employed in theform of loose grains, bonded to an abrasive wheel, or coated on paper or a fabric. Cements When mixed with water, inorganic cements form a paste that is capable of assum- ing just about any desired shape. Subsequent setting or hardening is a result ofchemical reactions involving the cement particles and occurs at the ambient tem-perature. For hydraulic cements, of which portland cement is the most common, thechemical reaction is one of hydration. Advanced Ceramics Many of our modern technologies utilize and will continue to utilize advanced ceramics because of their unique mechanical, chemical, electrical, magnetic, andoptical properties and property combinations. The following advanced ceramicmaterials were discussed briefly: piezoelectric ceramics, microelectromechanicalsystems (MEMS), and ceramic ball bearings. Fabrication and Processing of Glasses and Glass–Ceramics The next major section of this chapter discussed the principal techniques used for the fabrication of ceramic materials. Since glasses are formed at elevated tempera-tures, the temperature–viscosity behavior is an important consideration. Melting,working, softening, annealing, and strain points represent temperatures that corre-spond to specific viscosity values. Knowledge of these points is important in the fab-rication and processing of a glass of given composition. Four of the more commonglass-forming techniques—pressing, blowing, drawing, and fiber forming—werediscussed briefly. After fabrication, glasses may be annealed and/or tempered toimprove mechanical characteristics. Fabrication and Processing of Clay Products For clay products, two fabrication techniques that are frequently utilized are hy- droplastic forming and slip casting. After forming, a body must be first dried andthen fired at an elevated temperature to reduce porosity and enhance strength.Shrinkage that is excessive or too rapid may result in cracking and/or warping, anda worthless piece.

and silk. Other natural polymers such as proteins, enzymes, starches, andcellulose are important in biological and physiological processes in plants and an-imals. Modern scientific research tools have made possible the determination ofthe molecular structures of this group of materials, and the development of nu-merous polymers, which are synthesized from small organic molecules. Many ofour useful plastics, rubbers, and fiber materials are synthetic polymers. In fact, sincethe conclusion of World War II, the field of materials has been virtually revolu-tionized by the advent of synthetic polymers. The synthetics can be producedinexpensively, and their properties may be managed to the degree that many aresuperior to their natural counterparts. In some applications metal and wood partshave been replaced by plastics, which have satisfactory properties and may be pro-duced at a lower cost. As with metals and ceramics, the properties of polymers are intricately related to the structural elements of the material. This chapter explores molecular and crys-tal structures of polymers; Chapter 15 discusses the relationships between structureand some of the physical and chemical properties, along with typical applicationsand forming methods. 14.2 HYDROCARBON MOLECULES Since most polymers are organic in origin, we briefly review some of the basic con-cepts relating to the structure of their molecules. First, many organic materials arehydrocarbons; that is, they are composed of hydrogen and carbon. Furthermore, the intramolecular bonds are covalent. Each carbon atom has four electrons that mayparticipate in covalent bonding, whereas every hydrogen atom has only one bond-ing electron. A single covalent bond exists when each of the two bonding atomscontributes one electron, as represented schematically in Figure 2.10 for a moleculeof methane (CH 4). Double and triple bonds between two carbon atoms involve the sharing of two and three pairs of electrons, respectively.

electrons, respectively. For example, in ethylene,1496T_c14_489-522 1/2/06 10:33 Page 4902nd REVISE PAGESwhich has the chemical formula C 2H4, the two carbon atoms are doubly bonded together, and each is also singly bonded to two hydrogen atoms, as represented by the structural formula where and denote single and double covalent bonds, respectively. An exam- ple of a triple bond is found in acetylene, C 2H2: Molecules that have double and triple covalent bonds are termed unsaturated. That is, each carbon atom is not bonded to the maximum (four) other atoms; assuch, it is possible for another atom or group of atoms to become attached to theoriginal molecule. Furthermore, for a saturated hydrocarbon, all bonds are single ones, and no new atoms may be joined without the removal of others that are alreadybonded. Some of the simple hydrocarbons belong to the paraffin family; the chainlike paraffin molecules include methane (CH 4), ethane (C 2H6), propane (C 3H8), and bu- tane (C 4H10). Compositions and molecular structures for paraffin molecules are contained in Table 14.1. The covalent bonds in each molecule are strong, but onlyweak hydrogen and van der Waals bonds exist between molecules, and thus thesehydrocarbons have relatively low melting and boiling points. However, boiling tem-peratures rise with increasing molecular weight (Table 14.1). Hydrocarbon compounds with the same composition may have different atomic arrangements, a phenomenon termed isomerism. For example, there are two isomersH¬C‚C¬H“ ¬CHH HHC14.2 Hydrocarbon Molecules •491 unsaturated saturated Table 14.1 Compositions and Molecular Structures for Some of the Paraffin Compounds: C nH2n/H110012 Boiling Name Composition Structure Point (/H11034C) Methane CH 4 /H11002164 Ethane C2H6 /H1100288.6 Propane C3H8 /H1100242.1 Butane C4H10 /H110020.5 Pentane C5H12 36.1 Hexane C6H14 69.0isomerism CHH HH CHHH HHCH CHHH HHCCH HH1496T_c14_489-522 12/10/05 0:28 Page 491for butane; normal butane has the structure whereas a molecule of isobutane is represented as follows: Some of the physical properties of hydrocarbons will depend on the isomeric state; for example, the boiling temperatures for normal butane and isobutane are and (31.1 and ), respectively.

Several of the more common groups are presented in Table 14.2,where R and represent organic groups such as CH 3,C2H5, and C 6H5(methyl, ethyl, and phenyl). Concept Check 14.1 Differentiate between polymorphism (see Chapter 3) and isomerism. [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 14.3 POLYMER MOLECULES The molecules in polymers are gigantic in comparison to the hydrocarbon molecules already discussed; because of their size they are often referred to as macromolecules. Within each molecule, the atoms are bound together by covalent interatomic bonds.For carbon chain polymers, the backbone of each chain is a string of carbon atoms.Many times each carbon atom singly bonds to two adjacent carbons atoms on eitherside, represented schematically in two dimensions as follows: Each of the two remaining valence electrons for every carbon atom may be in- volved in side-bonding with atoms or radicals that are positioned adjacent to thechain. Of course, both chain and side double bonds are also possible. These long molecules are composed of structural entities called repeat units, which are successively repeated along the chain. 1The term monomer refers to the small molecule from which a polymer is synthesized.

This process begins when an active center is formed by the reaction between an initiator or catalyst species( ) and the ethylene monomer, as follows: (14.1) C/H11001HH HHC C RHHHH R·C ·R#CHHHH C14.4 The Chemistry of Polymer Molecules •493 Table 14.2 Some Common Hydrocarbon Groups Characteristic Representative Family Unit Compound Alcohols Methyl alcohol Ethers Dimethyl ether Acids Acetic acid Aldehydes Formaldehyde Aromatic hydrocarbons Phenol aThe simplified structure denotes a phenyl group,C CC C C CH H HHHOH R aC O HH C O HRC HH HC OOH R C OOHC HH HO CH HH O R R/H11032C HH HOH OH R1496T_c14_489-522 1/2/06 10:33 Page 4932nd REVISE PAGESThe polymer chain then forms by the sequential addition of monomer units to this active growing chain molecule. The active site, or unpaired electron (denoted is transferred to each successive end monomer as it is linked to the chain. This maybe represented schematically as follows: (14.2) The final result, after the addition of many ethylene monomer units, is the polyeth-ylene molecule; 2a portion of one such molecule and the polyethylene repeat unit are shown in Figure 14.1 a.

For exam- ple, the tetrafluoroethylene monomer, can polymerize to form poly- tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as follows: (14.3) Polytetrafluoroethylene (having the trade name TeflonTM) belongs to a family of polymers called the fluorocarbons.

the fluorocarbons. The vinyl chloride monomer is a slight variant of that for eth- ylene, in which one of the four H atoms is replaced with a Cl atom. Its polymer- ization is represented as (14.4) and leads to poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), another common polymer. Some polymers may be represented using the following generalized form: where the “R” depicts either an atom [i.e., H or Cl, for polyethylene or poly(vinylchloride), respectively], or an organic group such as CH 3,C2H5, and C 6H5(methyl, ethyl, and phenyl). For example, when R represents a CH 3group, the polymer is polypropylene (PP). Poly(vinyl chloride) and polypropylene chain structures are also represented in Figure 14.2. Table 14.3 lists repeat units for some of the morecommon polymers; as may be noted, some of them—for example, nylon, polyester,and polycarbonate—are relatively complex. Repeat units for a large number of rel-atively common polymers are given in Appendix D. When all the repeating units along a chain are of the same type, the resulting polymer is called a homopolymer. Chains may be composed of two or more dif- ferent repeat units, in what are termed copolymers (see Section 14.10). The monomers discussed thus far have an active bond that may react to form two covalent bonds with other monomers forming a two-dimensional chain-likemolecular structure, as indicated above for ethylene. Such a monomer is termed bifunctional. In general, the functionality is the number of bonds that a given monomer can form. For example, monomers such as phenol–formaldehyde (Table14.3), are trifunctional; they have three active bonds, from which a three- dimensional molecular network structure results.

Ordinarily, anaverage molecular weight is specified, which may be determined by the measurementof various physical properties such as viscosity and osmotic pressure.

polymer chains. For example, the melting or softening temperature increases with increasing molecular weight (for up to about 100,000 g/mol).At room temperature, polymers with veryshort chains (having molecular weights on the order of 100 g/mol) exist as liquidsor gases. Those with molecular weights of approximately 1000 g/mol are waxy solids(such as paraffin wax) and soft resins. Solid polymers (sometimes termed high poly- mers), which are of prime interest here, commonly have molecular weights rangingbetween 10,000 and several million g/mol.Thus, the same polymer material can havequite different properties if it is produced with a different molecular weight. Otherproperties that depend on molecular weight include elastic modulus and strength(see Chapter 15). 14.6 MOLECULAR SHAPE Previously, polymer molecules have been shown as linear chains, neglecting thezigzag arrangement of the backbone atoms (Figure 14.1 b). Single chain bonds are capable of rotating and bending in three dimensions. Consider the chain atoms inFigure 14.5 a; a third carbon atom may lie at any point on the cone of revolution and still subtend about a angle with the bond between the other two atoms.A straight chain segment results when successive chain atoms are positioned as inFigure 14.5b. On the other hand, chain bending and twisting are possible when thereis a rotation of the chain atoms into other positions, as illustrated in Figure 14.5 c. 5 Thus, a single chain molecule composed of many chain atoms might assume a shapesimilar to that represented schematically in Figure 14.6, having a multitude of bends,twists, and kinks. 6Also indicated in this figure is the end-to-end distance of the poly- mer chain r; this distance is much smaller than the total chain length. Polymers consist of large numbers of molecular chains, each of which may bend, coil, and kink in the manner of Figure 14.6.

Some of the mechanical and thermal characteristics of polymers are a function of the ability of chain segments to experience rotation in response to applied stressesor thermal vibrations. Rotational flexibility is dependent on repeat unit structureand chemistry. For example, the region of a chain segment that has a double bond is rotationally rigid. Also, introduction of a bulky or large side group of atoms restricts rotational movement. For example, polystyrene molecules, whichhave a phenyl side group (Table 14.3), are more resistant to rotational motion thanare polyethylene chains.

polyethylene chains. 14.7 MOLECULAR STRUCTURE The physical characteristics of a polymer depend not only on its molecular weightand shape but also on differences in the structure of the molecular chains. Modernpolymer synthesis techniques permit considerable control over various structuralpossibilities. This section discusses several molecular structures including linear,branched, crosslinked, and network, in addition to various isomeric configurations.

For linear polymers, there may be extensive van der Waals and hy-drogen bonding between the chains.

the chains. Some of the common polymers that form withlinear structures are polyethylene, poly(vinyl chloride), polystyrene, poly(methylmethacrylate), nylon, and the fluorocarbons. Branched Polymers Polymers may be synthesized in which side-branch chains are connected to the mainones, as indicated schematically in Figure 14.7 b; these are fittingly called branched polymers. The branches, considered to be part of the main-chain molecule, may re- sult from side reactions that occur during the synthesis of the polymer. The chainpacking efficiency is reduced with the formation of side branches, which results in alowering of the polymer density.Those polymers that form linear structures may alsobe branched. For example, high density polyethylene (HDPE) is primarily a linearpolymer, while low density polyethylene (LDPE) contains short chain branches. Crosslinked Polymers In crosslinked polymers, adjacent linear chains are joined one to another at vari- ous positions by covalent bonds, as represented in Figure 14.7 c. The process of502 •Chapter 14 / Polymer Structures linear polymerFigure 14.7 Schematic representations of (a) linear, (b) branched, (c) crosslinked, and (d) network (three-dimensional) molecular structures. Circles designate individual repeat units. branched polymer crosslinked polymer(a) (b) (c) (d)1496T_c14_489-522 12/7/05 16:41 Page 502crosslinking is achieved either during synthesis or by a nonreversible chemical reac- tion. Often, this crosslinking is accomplished by additive atoms or molecules that arecovalently bonded to the chains. Many of the rubber elastic materials are crosslinked;in rubbers, this is called vulcanization, a process described in Section 15.9.

Section 15.9. Network Polymers Multifunctional monomers forming three or more active covalent bonds, makethree-dimensional networks (Figure 14.7 d) and are termed network polymers. Actually, a polymer that is highly crosslinked may also be classified as a networkpolymer. These materials have distinctive mechanical and thermal properties; theepoxies, polyurethanes, and phenol-formaldehyde belong to this group. Polymers are not usually of only one distinctive structural type. For example, a predominantly linear polymer might have limited branching and crosslinking. 14.8 MOLECULAR CONFIGURATIONS For polymers having more than one side atom or group of atoms bonded to themain chain, the regularity and symmetry of the side group arrangement can signifi-cantly influence the properties. Consider the repeat unit in which R represents an atom or side group other than hydrogen (e.g., Cl, CH 3). One arrangement is possible when the R side groups of successive repeat units are bound to alternate carbon atoms as follows: This is designated as a head-to-tail configuration.7Its complement, the head-to-head configuration, occurs when R groups are bound to adjacent chain atoms:In most polymers, the head-to-tail configuration predominates; often a polar re- pulsion occurs between R groups for the head-to-head configuration. Isomerism (Section 14.2) is also found in polymer molecules, wherein different atomic configurations are possible for the same composition. Two isomeric sub-classes, stereoisomerism and geometrical isomerism, are topics of discussion in thesucceeding sections.CHH HC CHH HC R RCHHH C CHHH C R RCHHH C R14.8 Molecular Configurations •503 network polymer 7The term configuration is used in reference to arrangements of units along the axis of the chain, or atom positions that are not alterable except by the breaking and then reforming of primary bonds.1496T_c14_489-522 1/2/06 10:33 Page 5032nd REVISE PAGESStereoisomerism Stereoisomerism denotes the situation in which atoms are linked together in the same order (head-to-tail) but differ in their spatial arrangement.

spatial arrangement. For one stereoiso- mer, all the R groups are situated on the same side of the chain as follows: This is called an isotactic configuration. This diagram shows the zigzag pattern of the carbon chain atoms. Furthermore, representation of the structural geometry in three dimensions is important, as indicated by the wedge-shaped bonds; solid wedgesrepresent bonds that project out of the plane of the page, dashed ones representbonds that project into the page. 8 In a syndiotactic configuration, the R groups alternate sides of the chain:9 and for random positioning. the term atactic configuration is used.10H R H R H HH HHHH HHCCCCC C C C CH RR H RH R HH HH HHHH HHCCCCC C C C CRR HH RRH R H H R R H R HH HHHH HHCCCCC C C C CH R504 •Chapter 14 / Polymer Structures 8The isotactic configuration is sometimes represented using the following linear (i.e., nonzigzag) and two-dimensional schematic: 9The linear and two-dimensional schematic for syndiotactic is represented as 10For atactic the linear and two-dimensional schematic is CHHH HC CH C RR R RC H H HC CHH H HHC C RCHH HC CH H HC RR R RCH HC CHH H HCH C RCHH HC CHH HC R R RCH HC CH HH HC RH C Rstereoisomerism isotactic configuration syndiotactic configuration atactic configuration1496T_c14_489-522 1/2/06 10:33 Page 5042nd REVISE PAGESConversion from one stereoisomer to another (e.g., isotactic to syndiotactic) is not possible by a simple rotation about single chain bonds; these bonds must first be severed, and then, after the appropriate rotation, they are reformed. In reality, a specific polymer does not exhibit just one of these configurations; the predominant form depends on the method of synthesis.

of synthesis. Geometrical Isomerism Other important chain configurations, or geometrical isomers, are possible withinrepeat units having a double bond between chain carbon atoms. Bonded to each ofthe carbon atoms participating in the double bond is a side group, which may besituated on one side of the chain or its opposite. Consider the isoprene repeat unithaving the structure in which the CH 3group and the H atom are positioned on the same side of the double bond.This is termed a cisstructure, and the resulting polymer, cis-polyisoprene, is natural rubber. For the alternative isomer the trans structure, the CH 3and H reside on opposite sides of the double bond.11 Trans-polyisoprene, sometimes called gutta percha, has properties that are distinctly different from natural rubber as a result of this configurational alteration. Conver-sion of trans to cis, or vice versa, is not possible by a simple chain bond rotationbecause the chain double bond is extremely rigid. Summarizing the preceding sections, polymer molecules may be characterized in terms of their size, shape, and structure. Molecular size is specified in terms ofmolecular weight (or degree of polymerization). Molecular shape relates to the de-gree of chain twisting, coiling, and bending. Molecular structure depends on themanner in which structural units are joined together.

In fact, one classification scheme for thesematerials is according to behavior with rising temperature. Thermoplastics (or thermoplastic polymers) and thermosets (or thermosetting polymers) are the two subdivisions. Thermoplastics soften when heated (and eventually liquefy) andharden when cooled—processes that are totally reversible and may be repeated.On a molecular level, as the temperature is raised, secondary bonding forces are506 •Chapter 14 / Polymer Structures Figure 14.8 Classification scheme for the characteristics of polymer molecules.Molecular characteristics Chemistry (repeat unit composition)Size (molecular weight)Shape (chain twisting, entanglement, etc. )Structure Linear Branched Isomeric states Stereoisomers Isotactic Syndiotactic Atactic cis transGeometrical isomersCrosslinked Network thermoplastic polymer thermosetting polymer1496T_c14_489-522 12/7/05 16:41 Page 506diminished (by increased molecular motion) so that the relative movement of adjacent chains is facilitated when a stress is applied. Irreversible degradation re-sults when a molten thermoplastic polymer is raised to too high of a temperature.In addition, thermoplastics are relatively soft.

relatively soft. Most linear polymers and those hav-ing some branched structures with flexible chains are thermoplastic. These materi-als are normally fabricated by the simultaneous application of heat and pressure(see Section 15.22). Most linear polymers are thermoplastics. Examples of commonthermoplastic polymers include polyethylene, polystyrene, poly(ethylene tere-phthalate), and poly(vinyl chloride). Thermosetting polymers are network polymers.They become permanently hard during their formation, and do not soften upon heating. Network polymers have co-valent crosslinks between adjacent molecular chains. During heat treatments, thesebonds anchor the chains together to resist the vibrational and rotational chain mo-tions at high temperatures.Thus, the materials do not soften when heated. Crosslink-ing is usually extensive, in that 10 to 50% of the chain repeat units are crosslinked.Only heating to excessive temperatures will cause severance of these crosslink bondsand polymer degradation. Thermoset polymers are generally harder and strongerthan thermoplastics and have better dimensional stability. Most of the crosslinkedand network polymers, which include vulcanized rubbers, epoxies, and phenolicsand some polyester resins, are thermosetting. Concept Check 14.4 Some polymers (such as the polyesters) may be either thermoplastic or thermoset-ting. Suggest one reason for this.

One group of these materials are the copolymers. Consider a copolymer that is composed of two repeat units as represented by and in Figure 14.9.

Figure 14.9. Depending on the polymerization process and the relative fractions of these repeat unit types, different sequencing arrangements along thepolymer chains are possible. For one, as depicted in Figure 14.9 a, the two different units are randomly dispersed along the chain in what is termed a random copolymer. For an alternating copolymer, as the name suggests, the two repeat units alternate chain positions, as illustrated in Figure 14.9 b.A block copolymer is one in which identical repeat units are clustered in blocks along the chain (Figure 14.9 c). Finally, homopolymer side branches of one type may be grafted to homopolymer mainchains that are composed of a different repeat unit; such a material is termed a graft copolymer (Figure 14.9 d). When calculating the degree of polymerization for a copolymer, the value min Equation 14.7 is replaced with the average value that is determined from (14.7) In this expression, and are, respectively, the mole fraction and molecular weightof repeat unit j in the polymer chain.m j fjm/H11005©fj mjm/H17033 /H1703314.10 Copolymers •507 random copolymer alternating copolymer block copolymergraft copolymer Average repeat unit molecular weight fora copolymer1496T_c14_489-522 1/2/06 10:33 Page 5072nd REVISE PAGESSynthetic rubbers, discussed in Section 15.16, are often copolymers; chemical repeat units that are employed in some of these rubbers are contained in Table 14.5.

The rubbery isoprene blocks act to slow cracks propagatingthrough the material. 14.11 POLYMER CRYSTALLINITY The crystalline state may exist in polymeric materials. However, since it involves mol-ecules instead of just atoms or ions, as with metals and ceramics, the atomic arrange-ments will be more complex for polymers. We think of polymer crystallinity as the packing of molecular chains to produce an ordered atomic array. Crystal structuresmay be specified in terms of unit cells, which are often quite complex. For example,Figure 14.10 shows the unit cell for polyethylene and its relationship to the molec-ular chain structure; this unit cell has orthorhombic geometry (Table 3.2). Of course,the chain molecules also extend beyond the unit cell shown in the figure.508 •Chapter 14 / Polymer Structures Figure 14.9 Schematic representations of (a) random, (b)alternating, (c) block, and(d) graft copolymers.

As a consequence of their size and often complexity, polymer molecules are often onlypartially crystalline (or semicrystalline), having crystalline regions dispersed withinthe remaining amorphous material. Any chain disorder or misalignment will resultin an amorphous region, a condition that is fairly common, since twisting, kinking,and coiling of the chains prevent the strict ordering of every segment of every chain.Other structural effects are also influential in determining the extent of crystallinity,as discussed below. The degree of crystallinity may range from completely amorphous to almost entirely (up to about 95%) crystalline; in contrast, metal specimens are almost al-ways entirely crystalline, whereas many ceramics are either totally crystalline or to-tally noncrystalline. Semicrystalline polymers are, in a sense, analogous to two-phasemetal alloys, discussed previously. The density of a crystalline polymer will be greater than an amorphous one of the same material and molecular weight, since the chains are more closely packedtogether for the crystalline structure. The degree of crystallinity by weight may bedetermined from accurate density measurements, according to (14.8) where is the density of a specimen for which the percent crystallinity is to be de-termined, is the density of the totally amorphous polymer, and is the densityof the perfectly crystalline polymer.

crystalline polymer. The values of and must be measured byother experimental means. The degree of crystallinity of a polymer depends on the rate of cooling dur- ing solidification as well as on the chain configuration. During crystallizationupon cooling through the melting temperature, the chains, which are highly ran-dom and entangled in the viscous liquid, must assume an ordered configuration.For this to occur, sufficient time must be allowed for the chains to move andalign themselves. The molecular chemistry as well as chain configuration also influence the ability of a polymer to crystallize. Crystallization is not favored in polymers thatare composed of chemically complex repeat units (e.g., polyisoprene). On theother hand, crystallization is not easily prevented in chemically simple polymerssuch as polyethylene and polytetrafluoroethylene, even for very rapid coolingrates. For linear polymers, crystallization is easily accomplished because there are few restrictions to prevent chain alignment. Any side branches interfere with crystal-lization, such that branched polymers never are highly crystalline; in fact, excessivebranching may prevent any crystallization whatsoever. Most network andcrosslinked polymers are almost totally amorphous because the crosslinks preventthe polymer chains from rearranging and aligning into a crystalline structure. A fewcrosslinked polymers are partially crystalline. With regard to the stereoisomers,atactic polymers are difficult to crystallize; however, isotactic and syndiotactic poly-mers crystallize much more easily because the regularity of the geometry of theside groups facilitates the process of fitting together adjacent chains. Also, thebulkier or larger the side-bonded groups of atoms, the less tendency there is forcrystallization.r c rarc rars%crystallinity /H11005rc1rs/H11002ra2 rs1rc/H11002ra2/H11003100510 •Chapter 14 / Polymer Structures Percent crystallinity (semicrystallinepolymer)—dependence onspecimen density,and densities oftotally crystallineand totallyamorphous materials1496T_c14_489-522 12/7/05 16:41 Page 510For copolymers, as a general rule, the more irregular and random the re- peat unit arrangements, the greater is the tendency for the development of noncrystallinity.

To some extent, the physical properties of polymeric materials are influenced by the degree of crystallinity. Crystalline polymers are usually stronger and moreresistant to dissolution and softening by heat. Some of these properties are dis-cussed in subsequent chapters.

Thus, 14.12 POLYMER CRYSTALS It has been proposed that a semicrystalline polymer consists of small crystalline regions (crystallites), each having a precise alignment, which are interspersed with amorphous regions composed of randomly oriented molecules. The structure ofthe crystalline regions may be deduced by examination of polymer single crystals,which may be grown from dilute solutions. These crystals are regularly shaped, thinplatelets (or lamellae), approximately 10 to 20 nm thick, and on the order of10/H9262m long. Frequently, these platelets will form a multilayered structure, like that shown in the electron micrograph of a single crystal of polyethylene, Figure 14.11.The molecular chains within each platelet fold back and forth on themselves, withfolds occurring at the faces; this structure, aptly termed the chain-folded model, is /H1100546.4% /H110050.998 g/cm 3 10.925 g/cm3/H110020.870 g/cm32 0.925 g/cm3 10.998 g/cm3/H110020.870 g/cm32/H11003100 % crystallinity /H11005rc1rs/H11002ra2 rs1rc/H11002ra2/H11003100rs/H110050.925ra/H110050.870 rc/H110050.998 /H110050.998 g/cm3 /H1100512 repeat units/unit cell 2128.05 g/mol 2 19.33 /H1100310/H1100223 cm/H110023/unit cell 216.023 /H110031023 repeat units/mol 2 r/H11005nA VCNANA,512 •Chapter 14 / Polymer Structures crystallite chain-folded model Figure 14.11 Electron micrograph of a polyethylene single crystal.

Each platelet will consist of a number of molecules; however, the average chain length will be much greater than the thick-ness of the platelet. Many bulk polymers that are crystallized from a melt are semicrystalline and form a spherulite structure. As implied by the name, each spherulite may grow to be roughly spherical in shape; one of them, as found in natural rubber, is shown inthe transmission electron micrograph, the chapter-opening photograph for this chap-ter. The spherulite consists of an aggregate of ribbon-like chain-folded crystallites(lamellae) approximately 10 nm thick that radiate outward from a single nucleationsite in the center. In this electron micrograph, these lamellae appear as thin white lines. The detailed structure of a spherulite is illustrated schematically in Figure 14.13.Shown here are the individual chain-folded lamellar crystals that are separated by14.12 Polymer Crystals •513 Figure 14.13 Schematic representation of the detailed structure of a spherulite.~ 10 nm Interspherulitic boundaryNucleation SiteTie moleculeAmorphous materialLamellar chain-folded crystalliteDirection of spherulite growthFigure 14.12 The chain-folded structure for a plate-shaped polymercrystallite. spherulite1496T_c14_489-522 1/10/06 19:23 Page 5132nd REVISE PAGESamorphous material.

PAGESamorphous material. Tie-chain molecules that act as connecting links between adjacent lamellae pass through these amorphous regions. As the crystallization of a spherulitic structure nears completion, the extremi- ties of adjacent spherulites begin to impinge on one another, forming more or lessplanar boundaries; prior to this time, they maintain their spherical shape. Theseboundaries are evident in Figure 14.14, which is a photomicrograph of polyethyl-ene using cross-polarized light.A characteristic Maltese cross pattern appears withineach spherulite. The bands or rings in the spherulite image result from twisting ofthe lamellar crystals as they extend like ribbons from the center. Spherulites are considered to be the polymer analogue of grains in polycrys- talline metals and ceramics. However, as discussed above, each spherulite is reallycomposed of many different lamellar crystals and, in addition, some amorphousmaterial. Polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl chloride), polytetrafluoroethyl-ene, and nylon form a spherulitic structure when they crystallize from a melt. 14.13 DEFECTS IN POLYMERS The point defect concept is different in polymers than in metals (Section 4.2) andceramics (Section 12.5) as a consequence of the chain-like macromolecules and thenature of the crystalline state for polymers. Point defects similar to those found inmetals have been observed in crystalline regions of polymeric materials; these in-clude vacancies and interstitial atoms and ions. Chain ends are considered to be de-fects because they are chemically dissimilar to normal chain units. Vacancies arealso associated with the chain ends (Figure 14.15). However, additional defects canresult from branches in the polymer chain or chain segments that emerge from thecrystal.

from thecrystal. A chain section can leave a polymer crystal and reenter it at another pointcreating a loop, or can enter a second crystal to act as a tie molecule (see Figure14.13). Screw dislocations also occur in polymer crystals (Figure 14.15). Impurityatoms/ions or groups of atoms/ions may be incorporated in the molecular structureas interstitials; they may also be associated with main chains or as short sidebranches. Furthermore, the surfaces of chain-folded layers (Figure 14.13) are considered to be interfacial defects, as are also boundaries between two adjacent crystalline regions.514 •Chapter 14 / Polymer Structures Figure 14.14 A transmission photomicrograph (using cross-polarized light) showing the spherulite structure of polyethylene.

A poly-mer’s permeability and absorption characteristics relate to the degree to whichforeign substances diffuse into the material. Penetration of these foreign sub-stances can lead to swelling and/or chemical reactions with the polymer molecules,and often a degradation of the material’s mechanical and physical properties(Section 17.11). Rates of diffusion are greater through amorphous regions than through crys- talline regions; the structure of amorphous material is more “open.” This diffusionmechanism may be considered to be analogous to interstitial diffusion in metals—that is, in polymers, diffusive movements occur through small voids between poly-mer chains from one open amorphous region to an adjacent open one.

open one. Foreign molecule size also affects the diffusion rate: smaller molecules diffuse faster than larger ones. Furthermore, diffusion is more rapid for foreign moleculesthat are chemically inert than for those that react with the polymer. One step in diffusion through a polymer membrane is the dissolution of the mo- lecular species in the membrane material.This dissolution is a time-dependent process,and, if slower than the diffusive motion, may limit the overall rate of diffusion. Con-sequently, the diffusion properties of polymers are often characterized in terms of apermeability coefficient (denoted by where for the case of steady-state diffusion through a polymer membrane, Fick’s first law (Equation 5.3), is modified as (14.9) In this expression, Jis the diffusion flux of gas through the membrane [(cm 3 STP)/(cm2-s)], is the permeability coefficient, is the membrane thickness, and is the difference in pressure of the gas across the membrane.

STP indicates that this is the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure [273 K (0°C) and 101.3 kPa (1 atm)]. Thus, the units for S are (cm3STP)/Pa-cm3.

In such instancesit is normally the case that the permeation rate of the substance to be filtered issignificantly greater than for the other substance(s).

Cl, etc.) or organic groups such as methyl, ethyl, orphenyl groups. These macromolecules are composed of repeat units, smaller struc-tural entities, which are repeated along the chain. Repeat units for some of thechemically simple polymers [i.e., polyethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, poly(vinylchloride), and polypropylene] were presented.1496T_c14_489-522 12/7/05 16:41 Page 517Molecular Weight Molecular weights for high polymers may be in excess of a million. Since all mol- ecules are not of the same size, there is a distribution of molecular weights. Molec-ular weight is often expressed in terms of number and weight averages. Chain lengthmay also be specified by degree of polymerization, the number of repeat units peraverage molecule. Molecular Shape Molecular StructureMolecular ConfigurationsCopolymers Several molecular characteristics that have an influence on the properties of poly- mers were discussed. Molecular entanglements occur when the chains assumetwisted, coiled, and kinked shapes or contours. With regard to molecular structure,linear, branched, crosslinked, and network structures are possible, in addition toisotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic stereoisomers, and the cis and trans geometricalisomers. The copolymers include random, alternating, block, and graft types. Thermoplastic and Thermosetting Polymers With regard to behavior at elevated temperatures, polymers are classified as either thermoplastic or thermosetting.The former have linear and branched structures; theysoften when heated and harden when cooled. In contrast, thermosets, once havinghardened, will not soften upon heating; their structures are crosslinked and network. Polymer Crystallinity Polymer Crystals When the molecular chains are packed in an ordered atomic arrangement, the con- dition of crystallinity is said to exist.

to exist. In addition to being entirely amorphous, poly-mers may also exhibit varying degrees of crystallinity; that is, crystalline regionsare interdispersed within amorphous areas. Crystallinity is facilitated for polymersthat are chemically simple and that have regular and symmetrical chain structures.Many semicrystalline polymers form spherulites; each spherulite consists of a col-lection of ribbon-like chain-folded lamellar crystallites that radiate outward fromits center. Defects in Polymers Although the point defect state concept in polymers is different than metals and ceramics, vacancies, interstitial atoms, and impurity atoms/ions and groups ofatoms/ions as interstitials have been found to exist in crystalline regions. Otherdefects include chains ends, dangling and loose chains, as well as dislocations. Diffusion in Polymeric Materials With regard to diffusion in polymers, small molecules of foreign substances diffuse between molecular chains, by an interstitial-type mechanism from one amorphousregion to an adjacent one. Diffusion (or permeation) of gaseous species is oftencharacterized in terms of the permeability coefficient, which is the product of thediffusion coefficient and solubility in the polymer. Permeation flow rates areexpressed in terms of a modified form of Fick’s first law.518 •Chapter 14 / Polymer Structures 1496T_c14_489-522 12/7/05 16:41 Page 518REFERENCESQuestions and Problems •519 IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS Alternating copolymer Atactic configurationBifunctionalBlock copolymerBranched polymerChain-folded modelCis (structure)CopolymerCrosslinked polymerCrystalliteDegree of polymerizationFunctionalityGraft copolymerHomopolymerIsomerismIsotactic configurationLinear polymerMacromoleculeMolecular chemistryMolecular structureMolecular weightMonomerNetwork polymerPolymerPolymer crystallinityRandom copolymerRepeat unitSaturatedSpheruliteStereoisomerismSyndiotactic configurationThermoplastic polymerThermosetting polymerTrans (structure)TrifunctionalUnsaturated Baer, E., “Advanced Polymers,” Scientific Ameri- can, Vol.

(Photography by S. Tanner.) There are several reasons why an engineer should know something about the characteristics, applica-tions, and processing of polymeric materials. Polymersare used in a wide variety of applications from con-struction materials to microelectronics processing.Thus, most engineers will be required to work withpolymers at some point in their careers. Understand-ing the mechanisms by which polymers elastically andplastically deform allows one to alter and controltheir moduli of elasticity and strengths (Sections 15.7and 15.8). Also, additives may be incorporated intopolymeric materials to modify a host of properties,including strength, abrasion resistance, toughness,thermal stability, stiffness, deteriorability, color, andflammability resistance (Section 15.21).

Mechanical Behavior of Polymers 15.2 STRESS–STRAIN BEHAVIOR The mechanical properties of polymers are specified with many of the sameparameters that are used for metals—that is, modulus of elasticity, and yield andtensile strengths. For many polymeric materials, the simple stress–strain test isemployed for the characterization of some of these mechanical parameters. 1The mechanical characteristics of polymers, for the most part, are highly sensitive to therate of deformation (strain rate), the temperature, and the chemical nature of theenvironment (the presence of water, oxygen, organic solvents, etc.). Some modifi-cations of the testing techniques and specimen configurations used for metals(Chapter 6) are necessary with polymers, especially for the highly elastic materials,such as rubbers. Three typically different types of stress–strain behavior are found for polymeric materials, as represented in Figure 15.1. Curve Aillustrates the stress–strain char- acter for a brittle polymer, inasmuch as it fractures while deforming elastically. Thebehavior for a plastic material, curve B, is similar to that for many metallic mate- rials; the initial deformation is elastic, which is followed by yielding and a region ofplastic deformation. Finally, the deformation displayed by curve Cis totally elastic; this rubber-like elasticity (large recoverable strains produced at low stress levels)is displayed by a class of polymers termed the elastomers.

the elastomers. Modulus of elasticity (termed tensile modulus or sometimes just modulus for polymers) and ductility in percent elongation are determined for polymers in the 1ASTM Standard D 638, “Standard Test Method for Tensile Properties of Plastics.”elastomerPolymers1496T_c15_523-576 12/31/05 13:57 Page 5242nd REVISE PAGESsame manner as for metals (Section 6.6). For plastic polymers (curve B, Figure 15.1), the yield point is taken as a maximum on the curve, which occurs just beyond the termination of the linear-elastic region (Figure 15.2). The stress at this maximum isthe yield strength Furthermore, tensile strength ( TS) corresponds to the stress at which fracture occurs (Figure 15.2); TSmay be greater than or less than Strength, for these plastic polymers, is normally taken as tensile strength. Table 15.1gives these mechanical properties for several polymeric materials; more compre-hensive lists are provided in Tables B.2, B.3, and B.4, Appendix B. Polymers are, in many respects, mechanically dissimilar to metals (Figures 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6). For example, the modulus for highly elastic polymeric materials maybe as low as 7 MPa but may run as high as 4 GPa for some of the very stiff polymers; modulus values for metals are much larger and range be-tween 48 and 410 GPa to Maximum tensile strengths for polymers are about 100 MPa (15,000 psi)—for some metal alloys 4100 MPa (600,000psi).And, whereas metals rarely elongate plastically to more than 100%, some highlyelastic polymers may experience elongations to greater than 1000%. In addition, the mechanical characteristics of polymers are much more sensitive to temperature changes near room temperature.

In general, decreasing the rate of deformation has the same influence on the stress–strain characteristics as increasing the temperature; that is, the materialbecomes softer and more ductile. 15.3 MACROSCOPIC DEFORMATION Some aspects of the macroscopic deformation of semicrystalline polymers deserve ourattention. The tensile stress–strain curve for a semicrystalline material, which was ini-tially undeformed, is shown in Figure 15.4; also included in the figure are schematicrepresentations of the specimen profiles at various stages of deformation. Both upperand lower yield points are evident on the curve, which are followed by a near hori-zontal region. At the upper yield point, a small neck forms within the gauge sectionof the specimen.

the specimen. Within this neck, the chains become oriented (i.e., chain axes becomealigned parallel to the elongation direction, a condition that is represented schemati-cally in Figure 15.13 d), which leads to localized strengthening. Consequently, there is a resistance to continued deformation at this point, and specimen elongation proceedsby the propagation of this neck region along the gauge length; the chain orientationphenomenon (Figure 15.13 d) accompanies this neck extension. This tensile behavior may be contrasted to that found for ductile metals (Section 6.6), wherein once a neckhas formed, all subsequent deformation is confined to within the neck region. Concept Check 15.1 When citing the ductility as percent elongation for semicrystalline polymers, it is notnecessary to specify the specimen gauge length, as is the case with metals.Why is this so? [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 15.4 VISCOELASTIC DEFORMATION An amorphous polymer may behave like a glass at low temperatures, a rubberysolid at intermediate temperatures [above the glass transition temperature (Section15.12)], and a viscous liquid as the temperature is further raised. For relatively smalldeformations, the mechanical behavior at low temperatures may be elastic; that is,in conformity to Hooke’s law, At the highest temperatures, viscous or liquid-like behavior prevails. For intermediate temperatures the polymer is a rubbery solidthat exhibits the combined mechanical characteristics of these two extremes; thecondition is termed viscoelasticity.s/H11005E/H9280.15.4 Viscoelastic Deformation •527Stress StrainFigure 15.4 Schematic tensile stress–strain curve for a semicrystalline polymer.

In addition, upon release of the external stress, the deformationis totally recovered—the specimen assumes its original dimensions. This behavioris represented in Figure 15.5 bas strain versus time for the instantaneous load–time curve, shown in Figure 15.5 a. By way of contrast, for totally viscous behavior, deformation or strain is not in- stantaneous; that is, in response to an applied stress, deformation is delayed or de-pendent on time. Also, this deformation is not reversible or completely recoveredafter the stress is released. This phenomenon is demonstrated in Figure 15.5 d. For the intermediate viscoelastic behavior, the imposition of a stress in the man- ner of Figure 15.5a results in an instantaneous elastic strain, which is followed by a viscous, time-dependent strain, a form of anelasticity (Section 6.4); this behavior isillustrated in Figure 15.5 c. A familiar example of these viscoelastic extremes is found in a silicone poly- mer that is sold as a novelty and known by some as “silly putty.” When rolled intoa ball and dropped onto a horizontal surface, it bounces elastically—the rate of de-formation during the bounce is very rapid. On the other hand, if pulled in tensionwith a gradually increasing applied stress, the material elongates or flows like ahighly viscous liquid.

viscous liquid. For this and other viscoelastic materials, the rate of straindetermines whether the deformation is elastic or viscous. Viscoelastic Relaxation Modulus The viscoelastic behavior of polymeric materials is dependent on both time and tem-perature; several experimental techniques may be used to measure and quantify thisbehavior. Stress relaxation measurements represent one possibility. With these tests, a specimen is initially strained rapidly in tension to a predetermined and relatively lowstrain level.The stress necessary to maintain this strain is measured as a function of time,while temperature is held constant. Stress is found to decrease with time due to mo-lecular relaxation processes that take place within the polymer. We may define a re- laxation modulus a time-dependent elastic modulus for viscoelastic polymers, as (15.1) E r 1t2/H11005s1t2 /H92800Er(t),528 •Chapter 15 / Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers Load ta Time (a)tr Strain ta Time (b)trStrain ta Time (c)tr Strain ta Time (d)trFigure 15.5 (a) Load versus time, where load is applied instantaneously at time and released at For the load–time cycle in (a), the strain-versus- time responses are for totally elastic (b), viscoelastic (c), and viscous (d) behaviors.tr.ta relaxation modulus Relaxation modulus—ratio oftime-dependentstress and constant strain value1496T_c15_523-576 12/8/05 13:03 Page 528REVISED PAGESwhere is the measured time-dependent stress and is the strain level, which is maintained constant. Furthermore, the magnitude of the relaxation modulus is a function of tem- perature; and to more fully characterize the viscoelastic behavior of a polymer,isothermal stress relaxation measurements must be conducted over a range of tem-peratures.

of tem-peratures. Figure 15.6 is a schematic log -versus-log time plot for a polymerthat exhibits viscoelastic behavior. Curves generated at a variety of temperaturesare included. Key features of this plot are that (1) the magnitude of decreaseswith time (corresponding to the decay of stress, Equation 15.1), and (2) the curvesare displaced to lower levels with increasing temperature. To represent the influence of temperature, data points are taken at a specific time from the log -versus-log time plot—for example, in Figure 15.6—andthen cross-plotted as log versus temperature. Figure 15.7 is such a plot for anamorphous (atactic) polystyrene; in this case, was arbitrarily taken 10 s after theload application. Several distinct regions may be noted on the curve shown in thisfigure. At the lowest temperatures, in the glassy region, the material is rigid andbrittle, and the value of is that of the elastic modulus, which initially is vir-tually independent of temperature. Over this temperature range, the strain–timecharacteristics are as represented in Figure 15.5 b. On a molecular level, the long molecular chains are essentially frozen in position at these temperatures. As the temperature is increased, drops abruptly by about a factor of within a temperature span; this is sometimes called the leathery, or glass transition region, and the glass transition temperature ( Section 15.13) lies nearthe upper temperature extremity; for polystyrene (Figure 15.7),Within this temperature region, a polymer specimen will be leathery; that is, de-formation will be time dependent and not totally recoverable on release of anapplied load, characteristics that are depicted in Figure 15.5 c.T g/H11005100/H11034C (212/H11034F).Tg,20/H11034C (35/H11034F)103Er(10)Er(10)t1Er(t1)t1 Er(t)Er(t)Er(t)Er(t)/H92800 s(t)15.4 Viscoelastic Deformation •529Log relaxation modulus, E r(t) Log time, tt1T1 T2T3 T6T4 T5 T7T7 > T6 > .

The final two high-temperature regions are rubbery flow and viscous flow. Upon heating through these temperatures, the material experiences a gradual transitionto a soft rubbery state, and finally to a viscous liquid. In the rubbery flow region,the polymer is a very viscous liquid that exhibits both elastic and viscous flow com-ponents. Within the viscous flow region, the modulus decreases dramatically withincreasing temperature; again, the strain–time behavior is as represented in Fig-ure 15.5d. From a molecular standpoint, chain motion intensifies so greatly that forviscous flow, the chain segments experience vibration and rotational motion largelyindependent of one another. At these temperatures, any deformation is entirelyviscous and essentially no elastic behavior occurs. Normally, the deformation behavior of a viscous polymer is specified in terms of viscosity, a measure of a material’s resistance to flow by shear forces. Viscosityis discussed for the inorganic glasses in Section 12.10. The rate of stress application also influences the viscoelastic characteristics. In- creasing the loading rate has the same influence as lowering temperature. The log -versus-temperature behavior for polystyrene materials having several molecular configurations is plotted in Figure 15.8.

Rubber or elastomeric materials display this type of behavior and are ordinarily used at temperatures within this plateau range.

Fur-thermore, the relaxation modulus is maintained at a relatively high value with in-creasing temperature until its melting temperature is approached.

From Figure15.8, the melting temperature of this isotactic polystyrene is about Viscoelastic Creep Many polymeric materials are susceptible to time-dependent deformation when thestress level is maintained constant; such deformation is termed viscoelastic creep. This type of deformation may be significant even at room temperature and under modeststresses that lie below the yield strength of the material. For example, automobiletires may develop flat spots on their contact surfaces when the automobile is parkedfor prolonged time periods. Creep tests on polymers are conducted in the same man-ner as for metals (Chapter 8); that is, a stress (normally tensile) is applied instanta-neously and is maintained at a constant level while strain is measured as a functionof time. Furthermore, the tests are performed under isothermal conditions. Creepresults are represented as a time-dependent creep modulus defined by 2 (15.2) wherein is the constant applied stress and is the time-dependent strain.The creep modulus is also temperature sensitive and diminishes with increasingtemperature./H9280 (t) s0Ec1t2/H11005s0 /H9280 1t2Ec1t2,240/H11034C (460/H11034F).TmTg Er(10)15.4 Viscoelastic Deformation •531 Temperature (°C)Temperature (°F)Relaxation modulus, Er(10) (MPa) Relaxation modulus (psi) 1 50 100 150 200 25010102103104105106150 200 250 300 350 400 450104 103 102 10 1 10–1 10–2 10–3TgA B CFigure 15.8 Logarithm of the relaxation modulusversus temperature forcrystalline isotactic(curve A), lightly crosslinked atactic(curve B), and amorphous (curve C) polystyrene.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 15.5 FRACTURE OF POLYMERS The fracture strengths of polymeric materials are low relative to those of metalsand ceramics. As a general rule, the mode of fracture in thermosetting polymers(heavily crosslinked networks) is brittle. In simple terms, during the fracture process,cracks form at regions where there is a localized stress concentration (i.e., scratches,notches, and sharp flaws). As with metals (Section 8.5), the stress is amplified at thetips of these cracks leading to crack propagation and fracture. Covalent bonds inthe network or crosslinked structure are severed during fracture. For thermoplastic polymers, both ductile and brittle modes are possible, and many of these materials are capable of experiencing a ductile-to-brittle transition. Factorsthat favor brittle fracture are a reduction in temperature, an increase in strain rate,the presence of a sharp notch, increased specimen thickness, and any modification ofthe polymer structure that raises the glass transition temperature (see Section15.14).

(see Section15.14). Glassy thermoplastics are brittle below their glass transition temperatures.However, as the temperature is raised, they become ductile in the vicinity of their and experience plastic yielding prior to fracture.This behavior is demonstrated by thestress–strain characteristics of poly(methyl methacrylate) in Figure 15.3. At PMMA is totally brittle, whereas at it becomes extremely ductile. One phenomenon that frequently precedes fracture in some thermoplastic poly- mers is crazing. Associated with crazes are regions of very localized plastic deforma- tion,which lead to the formation of small and interconnected microvoids (Figure 15.9 a).60/H11034C4/H11034C,T gs(Tg)120/H11034CEc(t)532 •Chapter 15 / Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers Fibrillar bridges Microvoids Crack (a) (b) Figure 15.9 Schematic drawings of (a) a craze showing microvoids and fibrillar bridges, and (b) a craze followed by a crack.

If the applied tensile load is sufficient, these bridges elongate and break, causing the microvoids to grow and coalesce.As the microvoidscoalesce, cracks begin to form, as demonstrated in Figure 15.9 b. A craze is differ- ent from a crack in that it can support a load across its face. Furthermore, thisprocess of craze growth prior to cracking absorbs fracture energy and effectivelyincreases the fracture toughness of the polymer.

the polymer. In glassy polymers, the cracks prop-agate with little craze formation resulting in low fracture toughnesses. Crazes format highly stressed regions associated with scratches, flaws, and molecular inhomo-geneities; in addition, they propagate perpendicular to the applied tensile stress, andtypically are 5 /H9262m or less thick. Figure 15.10 is a photomicrograph in which a crazeis shown. Principles of fracture mechanics developed in Section 8.5 also apply to brittle and quasi-brittle polymers; the susceptibility of these materials to fracture when acrack is present may be expressed in terms of the plane strain fracture toughness.The magnitude of will depend on characteristics of the polymer (i.e., molecularweight, percent crystallinity, etc.) as well as temperature, strain rate, and the externalenvironment. Representative values of for several polymers are included inTable 8.1 and Table B.5, Appendix B. 15.6 MISCELLANEOUS MECHANICAL CHARACTERISTICS Impact Strength The degree of resistance of a polymeric material to impact loading may be of con-cern in some applications. Izod or Charpy tests are ordinarily used to assess impactstrength (Section 8.6). As with metals, polymers may exhibit ductile or brittle frac-ture under impact loading conditions, depending on the temperature, specimensize, strain rate, and mode of loading, as discussed in the preceding section. Bothsemicrystalline and amorphous polymers are brittle at low temperatures, and bothhave relatively low impact strengths. However, they experience a ductile-to-brittletransition over a relatively narrow temperature range, similar to that shown forK IcKIc15.6 Miscellaneous Mechanical Characteristics •533 Figure 15.10 Photomicrograph of a craze in poly(phenylene oxide).

Of course, impact strength undergoes a gradual decrease at still higher temperatures as the polymer begins to soften. Ordinarily, the two im-pact characteristics most sought after are a high impact strength at the ambienttemperature and a ductile-to-brittle transition temperature that lies below roomtemperature. Fatigue Polymers may experience fatigue failure under conditions of cyclic loading. As withmetals, fatigue occurs at stress levels that are low relative to the yield strength. Fa-tigue testing in polymers has not been nearly as extensive as with metals; however,fatigue data are plotted in the same manner for both types of material, and the re-sulting curves have the same general shape. Fatigue curves for several commonpolymers are shown in Figure 15.11, as stress versus the number of cycles to failure(on a logarithmic scale). Some polymers have a fatigue limit (a stress level at whichthe stress at failure becomes independent of the number of cycles); others do notappear to have such a limit. As would be expected, fatigue strengths and fatiguelimits for polymeric materials are much lower than for metals. The fatigue behavior of polymers is much more sensitive to loading frequency than for metals. Cycling polymers at high frequencies and/or relatively large stressescan cause localized heating; consequently, failure may be due to a softening of thematerial rather than as a result of typical fatigue processes. Tear Strength and Hardness Other mechanical properties that are sometimes influential in the suitability of apolymer for some particular application include tear resistance and hardness. Theability to resist tearing is an important property of some plastics, especially thoseused for thin films in packaging. Tear strength, the mechanical parameter that is measured, is the energy required to tear apart a cut specimen that has a standardgeometry.

a standardgeometry. The magnitude of tensile and tear strengths are related. As with metals, hardness represents a material’s resistance to scratching, pen- etration, marring, and so on.

Rockwell tests are frequently used for polymers.3Other indentation techniques employed are the Durometer and Barcol.4 Mechanisms of Deformation and for Strengthening of Polymers An understanding of deformation mechanisms of polymers is important in orderfor us to be able to manage the mechanical characteristics of these materials. In thisregard, deformation models for two different types of polymers—semicrystallineand elastomeric—deserve our attention.The stiffness and strength of semicrystallinematerials are often important considerations; elastic and plastic deformation mech-anisms are treated in the succeeding section, whereas methods used to stiffen andstrengthen these materials are discussed in Section 15.8.

Section 15.8. On the other hand, elas-tomers are utilized on the basis of their unusual elastic properties; the deformationmechanism of elastomers is also treated. 15.7 DEFORMATION OF SEMICRYSTALLINE POLYMERS Many semicrystalline polymers in bulk form will have the spherulitic structure de-scribed in Section 14.12. By way of review, let us repeat here that each spheruliteconsists of numerous chain-folded ribbons, or lamellae, that radiate outward from thecenter. Separating these lamellae are areas of amorphous material (Figure 14.13); ad-jacent lamellae are connected by tie chains that pass through these amorphous regions. Mechanism of Elastic Deformation As with other material types, elastic deformation of polymers occurs at relatively lowstress levels on the stress-strain curve (Figure 15.1). The onset of elastic deformationfor semicrystalline polymers results from chain molecules in amorphous regions elon-gating in the direction of the applied tensile stress.This process is represented schemat-ically for two adjacent chain-folded lamellae and the interlamellar amorphous materialas Stage 1 in Figure 15.12.Continued deformation in the second stage occurs by changesin both amorphous and lamellar crystalline regions. Amorphous chains continue toalign and become elongated; in addition, there is bending and stretching of the strongchain covalent bonds within the lamellar crystallites. This leads to a slight, reversibleincrease in the lamellar crystallite thickness as indicated by in Figure 15.12 c. Inasmuch as semicrystalline polymers are composed of both crystalline and amorphous regions, they may, in a sense, be considered composite materials.As such,the elastic modulus may be taken as some combination of the moduli of crystallineand amorphous phases.

Any chain displacement is resisted by relatively weak secondary or van der Waals bonds. Crystalline block segments separate from the lamellae, in Stage 4 (Figure 15.13 c), with the segments attached to one another by tie chains. In the final stage, Stage 5,the blocks and tie chains become oriented in the direction of the tensile axis (Fig-ure 15.13d). Thus, appreciable tensile deformation of semicrystalline polymers produces a highly oriented structure. This process of orientation is referred to as drawing, and is commonly used to improve the mechanical properties of polymer fibers and films (this is discussed in more detail in Section 15.24). During deformation the spherulites experience shape changes for moderate lev- els of elongation. However, for large deformations, the spherulitic structure is vir-tually destroyed. Also, to a degree, the processes represented in Figure 15.13 arereversible.That is, if deformation is terminated at some arbitrary stage, and the spec-imen is heated to an elevated temperature near its melting point (i.e., is annealed),the material will recrystallize to again form a spherulitic structure.

spherulitic structure. Furthermore,the specimen will tend to shrink back, in part, to the dimensions it had prior to de-formation. The extent of this shape and structural recovery will depend on theannealing temperature and also the degree of elongation. 15.8 FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SEMICRYSTALLINE POLYMERS A number of factors influence the mechanical characteristics of polymeric materi- als. For example, we have already discussed the effects of temperature and strainrate on stress–strain behavior (Section 15.2, Figure 15.3). Again, increasing the tem-perature or diminishing the strain rate leads to a decrease in the tensile modulus,a reduction in tensile strength, and an enhancement of ductility. In addition, several structural/processing factors have decided influences on the mechanical behavior (i.e., strength and modulus) of polymeric materials. An in-crease in strength results whenever any restraint is imposed on the process illus-trated in Figure 15.13; for example, extensive chain entanglements or a significantdegree of intermolecular bonding inhibit relative chain motions. It should be notedthat even though secondary intermolecular (e.g., van der Waals) bonds are muchweaker than the primary covalent ones, significant intermolecular forces result fromthe formation of large numbers of van der Waals interchain bonds. Furthermore,the modulus rises as both the secondary bond strength and chain alignment increase.As a result, polymers with polar groups will have stronger secondary bonds and alarger elastic modulus. We now discuss how several structural/processing factors[viz. molecular weight, degree of crystallinity, predeformation (drawing), and heattreating] affect the mechanical behavior of polymers. Molecular Weight The magnitude of the tensile modulus does not seem to be directly influenced bymolecular weight.

bymolecular weight. On the other hand, for many polymers it has been observed thattensile strength increases with increasing molecular weight. Mathematically, TSis a function of the number-average molecular weight according to (15.3) TS/H11005TS q/H11002A Mn538 •Chapter 15 / Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers drawing For some polymers, dependence oftensile strength onnumber-averagemolecular weight1496T_c15_523-576 12/8/05 13:03 Page 538REVISED PAGESwhere is the tensile strength at infinite molecular weight and Ais a constant. The behavior described by this equation is explained by increased chain entangle- ments with rising Degree of Crystallinity For a specific polymer, the degree of crystallinity can have a rather significant influ-ence on the mechanical properties, since it affects the extent of the intermolecular sec-ondary bonding. For crystalline regions in which molecular chains are closely packedin an ordered and parallel arrangement, extensive secondary bonding ordinarily ex-ists between adjacent chain segments. This secondary bonding is much less prevalentin amorphous regions, by virtue of the chain misalignment.As a consequence, for semi-crystalline polymers, tensile modulus increases significantly with degree of crystallinity.For example, for polyethylene, the modulus increases approximately an order of mag-nitude as the crystallinity fraction is raised from 0.3 to 0.6. Furthermore, increasing the crystallinity of a polymer generally enhances its strength; in addition, the material tends to become more brittle. The influence ofchain chemistry and structure (branching, stereoisomerism, etc.) on degree of crys-tallinity was discussed in Chapter 14. The effects of both percent crystallinity and molecular weight on the physical state of polyethylene are represented in Figure 15.14. Predeformation by Drawing On a commercial basis, one of the most important techniques used to improvemechanical strength and tensile modulus is to permanently deform the polymer intension.

polymer intension. This procedure is sometimes termed drawing, and corresponds to the neck extension process illustrated schematically in Figure 15.4. In terms of propertyalterations, drawing is the polymer analog of strain hardening in metals. It is animportant stiffening and strengthening technique that is employed in the produc-tion of fibers and films. During drawing the molecular chains slip past one anotherand become highly oriented; for semicrystalline materials the chains assumeconformations similar to that represented schematically in Figure 15.13 d. Degrees of strengthening and stiffening will depend on the extent of deforma- tion (or extension) of the material. Furthermore, the properties of drawn polymersare highly anisotropic. For those materials drawn in uniaxial tension, tensile modulusand strength values are significantly greater in the direction of deformation than inother directions. Tensile modulus in the direction of drawing may be enhanced byup to approximately a factor of three relative to the undrawn material. At an angleM n.TSq15.8 Factors That Influence the Mechanical Properties of Semicrystalline Polymers •539 Figure 15.14 The influence of degree of crystallinity and molecular weight on the physical characteristics of polyethylene.

undrawn polymer. Tensile strength parallel to the direction of orientation may be improved by a factor of at least two to five relative to that of the unoriented material. On the otherhand, perpendicular to the alignment direction, tensile strength is reduced by onthe order of one-third to one-half. For an amorphous polymer that is drawn at an elevated temperature, the ori- ented molecular structure is retained only when the material is quickly cooled tothe ambient; this procedure gives rise to the strengthening and stiffening effectsdescribed in the previous paragraph. On the other hand, if, after stretching, the poly-mer is held at the temperature of drawing, molecular chains relax and assumerandom conformations characteristic of the predeformed state; as a consequence,drawing will have no effect on the mechanical characteristics of the material. Heat Treating Heat treating (or annealing) of semicrystalline polymers can lead to an increase in thepercent crystallinity, and crystallite size and perfection, as well as modifications of thespherulite structure. For undrawn materials that are subjected to constant-time heattreatments, increasing the annealing temperature leads to the following: (1) an increasein tensile modulus, (2) an increase in yield strength, and (3) a reduction in ductility.Note that these annealing effects are opposite to those typically observed for metal-lic materials (Section 7.12)—i.e., weakening, softening, and enhanced ductility. For some polymer fibers that have been drawn, the influence of annealing on the tensile modulus is contrary to that for undrawn materials—that is, modulus de-creases with increased annealing temperature due to a loss of chain orientation andstrain-induced crystallinity.

Shrink-wrap is a polymer film, usually madeof poly(vinyl chloride), polyethylene, or polyolefin(a multilayer sheet with alternating layers of poly-ethylene and polypropylene). It is initially plasti-cally deformed (cold drawn) by about 20-300% toprovide a prestretched (aligned) film. The film iswrapped around an object to be packaged andsealed at the edges.

(Photography by S. Tanner.) 15.9 DEFORMATION OF ELASTOMERS One of the fascinating properties of the elastomeric materials is their rubber-like elas- ticity. That is, they have the ability to be deformed to quite large deformations, andthen elastically spring back to their original form. This results from crosslinks in thepolymer that provide a force to restore the chains to their undeformed conforma-tions. Elastomeric behavior was probably first observed in natural rubber; however,the past few years have brought about the synthesis of a large number of elastomerswith a wide variety of properties. Typical stress–strain characteristics of elastomericmaterials are displayed in Figure 15.1, curve C. Their moduli of elasticity are quite small and, furthermore, vary with strain since the stress–strain curve is nonlinear. In an unstressed state, an elastomer will be amorphous and composed of crosslinked molecular chains that are highly twisted, kinked, and coiled. Elastic de-formation, upon application of a tensile load, is simply the partial uncoiling, un-twisting, and straightening, and the resultant elongation of the chains in the stressdirection, a phenomenon represented in Figure 15.15. Upon release of the stress, (b) (a)/H9268 /H9268CrosslinksFigure 15.15 Schematic representation of crosslinked polymer chain molecules ( a) in an unstressed state and ( b) during elastic deformation in response to an applied tensile stress.

Part of the driving force for elastic deformation is a thermodynamic parame- ter called entropy, which is a measure of the degree of disorder within a system; en- tropy increases with increasing disorder.As an elastomer is stretched and the chainsstraighten and become more aligned, the system becomes more ordered. From thisstate, the entropy increases if the chains return to their original kinked and coiledcontours. Two intriguing phenomena result from this entropic effect. First, whenstretched, an elastomer experiences a rise in temperature; second, the modulus ofelasticity increases with increasing temperature, which is opposite to the behaviorfound in other materials (see Figure 6.8). Several criteria must be met for a polymer to be elastomeric: (1) It must not easily crystallize; elastomeric materials are amorphous, having molecular chains thatare naturally coiled and kinked in the unstressed state. (2) Chain bond rotationsmust be relatively free for the coiled chains to readily respond to an applied force. (3) For elastomers to experience relatively large elastic deformations, the onset ofplastic deformation must be delayed. Restricting the motions of chains past one an-other by crosslinking accomplishes this objective.The crosslinks act as anchor pointsbetween the chains and prevent chain slippage from occurring; the role of crosslinksin the deformation process is illustrated in Figure 15.15.

Figure 15.15. Crosslinking in many elas-tomers is carried out in a process called vulcanization, to be discussed below. (4)Finally, the elastomer must be above its glass transition temperature (Section 15.13).The lowest temperature at which rubber-like behavior persists for many of thecommon elastomers is between and ( and Below its glasstransition temperature, an elastomer becomes brittle such that its stress–strainbehavior resembles curve Ain Figure 15.1. Vulcanization The crosslinking process in elastomers is called vulcanization, which is achieved by a nonreversible chemical reaction, ordinarily carried out at an elevated tempera-ture. In most vulcanizing reactions, sulfur compounds are added to the heatedelastomer; chains of sulfur atoms bond with adjacent polymer backbone chainsand crosslink them, which is accomplished according to the following reaction:/H11002130/H11034F). /H1100260 /H1100290/H11034C /H1100250542 •Chapter 15 / Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers C HH CCH3 CH C HHC HHC (S)m (S)n /H11001 (m /H11001 n) SCH3 CH C HH C HH C CH3C HC HHC HHC CH3C HC HHvulcanization in which the two crosslinks shown consist of m and nsulfur atoms.

The mag-nitude of the modulus of elasticity is directly proportional to the density of the1496T_c15_523-576 12/8/05 13:03 Page 542REVISED PAGEScrosslinks.

542REVISED PAGEScrosslinks. Stress–strain curves for vulcanized and unvulcanized natural rubber are presented in Figure 15.16. To produce a rubber that is capable of large extensionswithout rupture of the primary chain bonds, there must be relatively few crosslinks,and these must be widely separated. Useful rubbers result when about 1 to 5 parts(by weight) of sulfur are added to 100 parts of rubber. This corresponds to aboutone crosslink for every 10 to 20 repeat units. Increasing the sulfur content furtherhardens the rubber and also reduces its extensibility.Also, since they are crosslinked,elastomeric materials are thermosetting in nature.

glass transition. Crystal-lization is the process by which, upon cooling, an ordered (i.e., crystalline) solidphase is produced from a liquid melt having a highly random molecular structure.The melting transformation is the reverse process that occurs when a polymer isheated. The glass-transition phenomenon occurs with amorphous or noncrystalliz-able polymers that, when cooled from a liquid melt, become rigid solids yet retainthe disordered molecular structure that is characteristic of the liquid state. Of course,alterations of physical and mechanical properties attend crystallization, melting, andthe glass transition. Furthermore, for semicrystalline polymers, crystalline regionswill experience melting (and crystallization), while noncrystalline areas pass throughthe glass transition. 15.10 CRYSTALLIZATION An understanding of the mechanism and kinetics of polymer crystallization is im-portant because the degree of crystallinity influences the mechanical and thermalproperties of these materials. The crystallization of a molten polymer occurs by nu-cleation and growth processes, topics discussed in the context of phase transfor-mations for metals in Section 10.3. For polymers, upon cooling through the meltingtemperature, nuclei form wherein small regions of the tangled and random mole-cules become ordered and aligned in the manner of chain-folded layers, Figure 14.12.At temperatures in excess of the melting temperature, these nuclei are unstable dueto the thermal atomic vibrations that tend to disrupt the ordered molecular arrange-ments. Subsequent to nucleation and during the crystallization growth stage, nucleigrow by the continued ordering and alignment of additional molecular chain seg-ments; that is, the chain-folded layers remain the same thickness, but increase in lat-eral dimensions, or for spherulitic structures (Figure 14.13) there is an increase inspherulite radius. The time dependence of crystallization is the same as for many solid-state transformations—Figure 10.10; that is, a sigmoidal-shaped curve results whenfraction transformation (i.e., fraction crystallized) is plotted versus the logarithm oftime (at constant temperature).

constant temperature). Such a plot is presented in Figure 15.17 for the crys-tallization of polypropylene at three temperatures. Mathematically, fractioncrystallized yis a function of time t according to the Avrami equation, Equation 10.17, as (10.17) where kand nare time-independent constants, whose values depend on the crys- tallizing system. Normally, the extent of crystallization is measured by specimen vol-ume changes since there will be a difference in volume for liquid and crystallizedphases. Rate of crystallization may be specified in the same manner as for the trans-formations discussed in Section 10.3, and according to Equation 10.18; that is, rateis equal to the reciprocal of time required for crystallization to proceed to 50%completion.This rate is dependent on crystallization temperature (Figure 15.17) andalso on the molecular weight of the polymer; rate decreases with increasingmolecular weight.y/H110051/H11002exp1/H11002kt n2544 •Chapter 15 / Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers1496T_c15_523-576 12/8/05 13:03 Page 544REVISED PAGESFor polypropylene (as well as any polymer), the attainment of 100% crystallinity is not possible. Therefore, in Figure 15.17, the vertical axis is scaled as “normalized fraction crystallized.” A value of 1.0 for this parameter corresponds to the highestlevel of crystallization that is achieved during the tests, which, in reality, is less thancomplete crystallization. 15.11 MELTING The melting of a polymer crystal corresponds to the transformation of a solidmaterial, having an ordered structure of aligned molecular chains, to a viscousliquid in which the structure is highly random. This phenomenon occurs, uponheating, at the melting temperature, There are several features distinctive to the melting of polymers that are not normally observed with metals and ceram-ics; these are consequences of the polymer molecular structures and lamellar crys-talline morphology.

crys-talline morphology. First of all, melting of polymers takes place over a range oftemperatures; this phenomenon is discussed in more detail below. In addition, themelting behavior depends on the history of the specimen, in particular the tem-perature at which it crystallized. The thickness of chain-folded lamellae willdepend on crystallization temperature; the thicker the lamellae, the higher themelting temperature. Impurities in the polymer and imperfections in the crystalsalso decrease the melting temperature. Finally, the apparent melting behavior isa function of the rate of heating; increasing this rate results in an elevation of themelting temperature. As a previous section notes, polymeric materials are responsive to heat treat- ments that produce structural and property alterations. An increase in lamellarthickness may be induced by annealing just below the melting temperature. An-nealing also raises the melting temperature by decreasing the vacancies and otherimperfections in polymer crystals and increasing crystallite thickness. 15.12 THE GLASS TRANSITION The glass transition occurs in amorphous (or glassy) and semicrystalline polymers,and is due to a reduction in motion of large segments of molecular chains with de-creasing temperature. Upon cooling, the glass transition corresponds to the grad-ual transformation from a liquid to a rubbery material, and finally, to a rigid solid.T m.15.12 The Glass Transition •545 Figure 15.17 Plot of normalized fraction crystallized versus thelogarithm of time forpolypropylene at constanttemperatures of and (Adapted from P .

is heated. In addition, abrupt changes in other physical properties accompany thisglass transition: for example, stiffness (Figure 15.7), heat capacity, and coefficient ofthermal expansion. 15.13 MELTING AND GLASS TRANSITION TEMPERATURES Melting and glass transition temperatures are important parameters relative to in-service applications of polymers.They define, respectively, the upper and lower tem-perature limits for numerous applications, especially for semicrystalline polymers.The glass transition temperature may also define the upper use temperature forglassy amorphous materials. Furthermore, and also influence the fabricationand processing procedures for polymers and polymer-matrix composites. Theseissues are discussed in succeeding sections of this chapter. The temperatures at which melting and/or the glass transition occur for a poly- mer are determined in the same manner as for ceramic materials—from a plot ofspecific volume (the reciprocal of density) versus temperature. Figure 15.18 is sucha plot, where curves Aand C, for amorphous and crystalline polymers, respectively, have the same configurations as their ceramic counterparts (Figure 13.6). 5For the crystalline material, there is a discontinuous change in specific volume at the melt-ing temperature The curve for the totally amorphous material is continuous butexperiences a slight decrease in slope at the glass transition temperature, Thebehavior is intermediate between these extremes for a semicrystalline polymer(curve B) in that both melting and glass transition phenomena are observed; and are properties of the respective crystalline and amorphous phases in this T gTmTg.Tm.Tg TmTgTg.546 •Chapter 15 / Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers Specific volume TemperatureLiquid A B C Tg TmGlass Semicrystalline solid Crystalline solidglass transition temperature Figure 15.18 Specific volume versus temperature, upon cooling from the liquid melt, for totally amorphous(curve A), semicrystalline (curve B), and crystalline (curve C) polymers.

As discussed above, the behaviors represented in Figure 15.18 will depend on the rate of cooling or heating. Representative melting andglass transition temperatures of a number of polymers are contained in Table 15.2and Appendix E. 15.14 FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE MELTING AND GLASS TRANSITION TEMPERATURES Melting Temperature During melting of a polymer there will be a rearrangement of the molecules in thetransformation from ordered to disordered molecular states. Molecular chemistryand structure will influence the ability of the polymer chain molecules to make theserearrangements and, therefore, will also affect the melting temperature. Chain stiffness, which is controlled by the ease of rotation about the chemical bonds along the chain, has a pronounced effect. The presence of double bonds andaromatic groups in the polymer backbone lowers chain flexibility and causes an in-crease in Furthermore, the size and type of side groups influence chain rotationalfreedom and flexibility; bulky or large side groups tend to restrict molecular rota-tion and raise For example, polypropylene has a higher melting temperaturethan polyethylene ( versus Table 15.2); the CH 3methyl side group for polypropylene is larger than the H atom found on polyethylene. The presence ofpolar groups (viz. Cl, OH, and CN), even though not excessively large, leads to sig-nificant intermolecular bonding forces and relatively high This may be veri-fied by comparing the melting temperatures of polypropylene andpoly(vinyl chloride) The melting temperature of a polymer will also depend on molecular weight.

molecular weight. At relatively low molecular weights, increasing (or chain length) raises (Fig-ure 15.19). Furthermore, the melting of a polymer takes place over a range oftemperatures, and, thus, there will be a range of rather than a single meltingtemperature. This is because every polymer will be composed of molecules havinga variety of molecular weights (Section 14.5), and because depends on molecu-lar weight. For most polymers, this melting temperature range will normally be onthe order of several degrees Celsius. Those melting temperatures cited in Table 15.2and Appendix E are near the high ends of these ranges. Degree of branching will also affect the melting temperature of a polymer.

melting temperature. High-density polyethylene, being a predominately linear polymer, has a higher melting temperature ( Table 15.2) than low-density polyethylene which has some branching. Glass Transition Temperature Upon heating through the glass transition temperature, the amorphous solid polymertransforms from a rigid to a rubbery state. Correspondingly, the molecules that arevirtually frozen in position below begin to experience rotational and translationalmotions above Thus, the value of the glass transition temperature will depend onmolecular characteristics that affect chain stiffness; most of these factors and theirinfluences are the same as for the melting temperature, as discussed above. Again,chain flexibility is diminished and is increased by the presence of the following: 1.Bulky side groups; from Table 15.2, the respective values for polypropyleneand polystyrene are and 2.Polar groups; for example, the values for poly(vinyl chloride) andpolypropylene are and respectively. 3.Double bonds and aromatic groups in the backbone, which tend to stiffen thepolymer chain. Increasing the molecular weight also tends to raise the glass transition tem- perature, as noted in Figure 15.19. A small amount of branching will tend to lower on the other hand, a high density of branches reduces chain mobility, and ele- vates the glass transition temperature. Some amorphous polymers are crosslinked, which has been observed to elevate crosslinks restrict molecular motion. Witha high density of crosslinks, molecular motion is virtually disallowed; long-rangemolecular motion is prevented, to the degree that these polymers do not experi-ence a glass transition or its accompanying softening. From the preceding discussion it is evident that essentially the same molecular characteristics raise and lower both melting and glass transition temperatures. Nor-mally the value of lies somewhere between 0.5 and 0.8 (in Kelvin). Conse-quently, for a homopolymer, it is not possible to independently vary both and A greater degree of control over these two parameters is possible by the syn- thesis and utilization of copolymeric materials.T g.TmTm TgTg;Tg;/H1100218/H11034C, 87/H11034CTg100/H11034C.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Polymer Types There are many different polymeric materials that are familiar to us and find a wide variety of applications; in fact, one way of classifying them is according to their end-use. Within this scheme the various polymer types include plastics, elastomers (orrubbers), fibers, coatings, adhesives, foams, and films. Depending on its properties,a particular polymer may be used in two or more of these application categories.For example, a plastic, if crosslinked and utilized above its glass transition temper-ature, may make a satisfactory elastomer. Or a fiber material may be used as aplastic if it is not drawn into filaments. This portion of the chapter includes a briefdiscussion of each of these types of polymer. 15.15 PL ASTICS Possibly the largest number of different polymeric materials come under the plasticclassification. Plastics are materials that have some structural rigidity under load, and are used in general-purpose applications. Polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinylchloride), polystyrene, and the fluorocarbons, epoxies, phenolics, and polyesters mayall be classified as plastics. They have a wide variety of combinations of properties.Some plastics are very rigid and brittle (Figure 15.1, curve A). Others are flexible, exhibiting both elastic and plastic deformations when stressed, and sometimesexperiencing considerable deformation before fracture (Figure 15.1, curve B). Polymers falling within this classification may have any degree of crystallinity, and all molecular structures and configurations (linear, branched, isotactic, etc.) arepossible. Plastic materials may be either thermoplastic or thermosetting; in fact, thisis the manner in which they are usually subclassified. However, to be considered15.15 Plastics •549 plastic1496T_c15_523-576 12/8/05 13:03 Page 549REVISED PAGESplastics, linear or branched polymers must be used below their glass transition tem- peratures (if amorphous) or below their melting temperatures (if semicrystalline),or must be crosslinked enough to maintain their shape.

their shape. The trade names, character-istics, and typical applications for a number of plastics are given in Table 15.3. Several plastics exhibit especially outstanding properties. For applications in which optical transparency is critical, polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) areespecially well suited; however, it is imperative that the material be highly amorphousor, if semicrystalline, have very small crystallites. The fluorocarbons have a low co-efficient of friction and are extremely resistant to attack by a host of chemicals, evenat relatively high temperatures. They are utilized as coatings on nonstick cookware,in bearings and bushings, and for high-temperature electronic components.550 •Chapter 15 / Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers Table 15.3 Trade Names, Characteristics, and Typical Applications for a Number of Plastic Materials Trade Major Application Material Type Names Characteristics Typical Applications Acrylonitrile- butadiene- styrene (ABS) Acrylics [poly(methylmethacrylate)] Fluorocarbons (PTFE orTFE) Polyamides (nylons) Polycarbonates PolyethyleneAbson Cycolac KralasticLustranNovodurTybrene Acrylite DiakonLucitePlexiglas Teflon FluonHalarHostaflon TFNeoflon Nylon BaylonDurethanHeroxNomexUltramidZytel Calibre IupilonLexanMakrolonMerlon Alathon AlkatheneFortiflexHi-faxPetrotheneRigidexRototheneZendelThermoplastics Outstanding strength and toughness, resistant to heat distortion; goodelectrical properties; flammable andsoluble in some organic solvents Outstanding light transmission and resistance to weathering; only fairmechanical properties Chemically inert in almost all environ- ments, excellent electrical properties;low coefficient of friction; may beused to relatively weak and poor cold-flow properties Good mechanical strength, abrasion resistance, and toughness; low coef-ficient of friction; absorbs water andsome other liquids Dimensionally stable; low water absorption; transparent; very goodimpact resistance and ductility;chemical resistance not outstanding Chemically resistant and electrically insulating; tough and relatively lowcoefficient of friction; low strengthand poor resistance to weathering260/H11034C (500/H11034F);Refrigerator linings, lawn and garden equipment, toys,highway safety devices Lenses, transparent aircraft enclosures, draftingequipment, outdoor signs Anticorrosive seals, chemical pipes and valves, bearings,antiadhesive coatings, high-temperature electronic parts Bearings, gears, cams, bushings, handles, and jacketing forwires and cables Safety helmets, lenses, light globes, base for photo-graphic film Flexible bottles, toys, tumblers, battery parts, ice trays, filmwrapping materials1496T_c15_523-576 1/6/06 00:15 Page 5503rd REVISE PAGES15.15 Plastics •551 Source: Adapted from C.

of elephants. For a ball to roll true, it neededto be fashioned from high-quality ivory that camefrom the center of flaw-free tusks—on the orderof one tusk in fifty had the requisite consistencyof density. At this time, ivory was becoming scarceand expensive as more and more elephants werebeing killed (and billiards was becoming popular).Also, there was then (and still is) a serious con-cern about reductions in elephant populations (andtheir ultimate extinction) due to ivory hunters, andsome countries had imposed (and still impose) se-vere restrictions on the importation of ivory andivory products. Consequently, substitutes for ivory were sought for billiard balls. For example, one early al-ternative was a pressed mixture of wood pulp andbone dust; this material proved quite unsatisfac-tory. The most suitable replacement (which is stillbeing used for billiard balls today) is one of thefirst man-made polymers—phenol-formaldehyde,sometimes also called “phenolic”. The invention of this material is one of the im- portant and interesting events in the annals ofman-made polymers.The discoverer of the processfor synthesizing phenol-formaldehyde was LeoBaekeland. As a young and very bright Ph.D.chemist, he immigrated from Belgium to theUnited States in the early 1900s. Shortly after hisarrival, he began research into creating a syntheticshellac, to replace the natural material, which wasrelatively expensive to manufacture; shellac was(and is still) used as a lacquer, a wood preserva-tive, and as an electrical insulator in the then-emerging electrical industry. His efforts eventuallyled to the discovery that a suitable substitute couldbe synthesized by reacting phenol [or carbolic acid a white crystalline material] with for- maldehyde (HCHO, a colorless and poisonousgas) under controlled conditions of heat and pres-sure.

and pres-sure. The product of this reaction was a liquid thatsubsequently hardened into a transparent andamber-colored solid. Baekeland named his newmaterial “Bakelite”; today we use the genericnames “ phenol-formaldehyde” or just “phenolic”. Shortly after its discovery, Bakelite was found to be the ideal synthetic material for billiard balls(per the chapter-opening photograph for thischapter). Phenol-formaldehyde is a thermosetting poly- mer, and has a number of desirable properties: fora polymer it is very heat resistant and hard, is lessbrittle than many of the ceramic materials, is verystable and unreactive with most common solutionsand solvents, and doesn’t easily chip, fade, or dis-color. Furthermore, it is a relatively inexpensivematerial, and modern phenolics can be producedhaving a large variety of colors. The elastic char-acteristics of this polymer are very similar to thoseof ivory, and when phenolic billiard balls collide,they make the same clicking sound as ivory balls.Other uses of this important polymeric materialare found in Table 15.3. (C 6H5OH), 15.16 ELASTOMERS The characteristics of and deformation mechanism for elastomers were treated pre-viously (Section 15.9). The present discussion, therefore, focuses on the types ofelastomeric materials. Table 15.4 lists properties and applications of common elastomers; these prop- erties are typical and, of course, depend on the degree of vulcanization and onwhether any reinforcement is used. Natural rubber is still utilized to a large degreebecause it has an outstanding combination of desirable properties. However, themost important synthetic elastomer is SBR, which is used predominantly in auto-mobile tires, reinforced with carbon black. NBR, which is highly resistant to degra-dation and swelling, is another common synthetic elastomer.1496T_c15_523-576 12/8/05 13:03 Page 552REVISED PAGESFor many applications (e.g., automobile tires), the mechanical properties of even vulcanized rubbers are not satisfactory in terms of tensile strength, abrasion and tear resistance, and stiffness.

Most commercial fiber polymers are utilized in thetextile industry, being woven or knit into cloth or fabric. In addition, the aramidfibers are employed in composite materials, Section 16.8. To be useful as a textilematerial, a fiber polymer must have a host of rather restrictive physical and chem-ical properties. While in use, fibers may be subjected to a variety of mechanicaldeformations—stretching, twisting, shearing, and abrasion. Consequently, they musthave a high tensile strength (over a relatively wide temperature range) and a highmodulus of elasticity, as well as abrasion resistance. These properties are governedby the chemistry of the polymer chains and also by the fiber drawing process. The molecular weight of fiber materials should be relatively high or the molten material will be too weak and will break during the drawing process. Also, becausethe tensile strength increases with degree of crystallinity, the structure and config-uration of the chains should allow the production of a highly crystalline poly-mer. That translates into a requirement for linear and unbranched chains that are/H1100255/H11034C (/H11002 65/H11034F).250/H11034C (480/H11034F). /H1100290/H11034C (/H11002130/H11034F) fiber1496T_c15_523-576 12/8/05 13:03 Page 554REVISED PAGESsymmetrical and have regular repeat units. Polar groups in the polymer also im- prove the fiber-forming properties by increasing both crystallinity and the inter-molecular forces between the chains. Convenience in washing and maintaining clothing depends primarily on the thermal properties of the fiber polymer, that is, its melting and glass transition tem-peratures.

transition tem-peratures. Furthermore, fiber polymers must exhibit chemical stability to a ratherextensive variety of environments, including acids, bases, bleaches, dry cleaning sol-vents, and sunlight. In addition, they must be relatively nonflammable and amenableto drying. 15.18 MISCELLANEOUS APPLICATIONS Coatings Coatings are frequently applied to the surface of materials to serve one or more ofthe following functions: (1) to protect the item from the environment that may pro-duce corrosive or deteriorative reactions; (2) to improve the item’s appearance; and(3) to provide electrical insulation. Many of the ingredients in coating materials arepolymers, the majority of which are organic in origin. These organic coatings fall intoseveral different classifications, as follows: paint, varnish, enamel, lacquer, and shellac. Many common coatings are latexes. A latex is a stable suspension of small insoluble polymer particles dispersed in water. These materials have becomeincreasingly popular because they don’t contain large quantities of organic solventsthat are emitted into the environment—that is, they have low volatile organic com-pound (VOC) emissions. VOCs react in the atmosphere to produce smog. Largeusers of coatings such as automobile manufacturers continue to reduce their VOCemissions to comply with environmental regulations. Adhesives An adhesive is a substance used to bond together the surfaces of two solid materials (termed “adherends”). There are two types of bonding mechanisms: mechanical andchemical. For mechanical there is actual penetration of the adhesive into surface poresand crevices. Chemical bonding involves intermolecular forces between the adhesiveand adherend, which forces may be covalent and/or van der Waals; degree of van derWaals bonding is enhanced when the adhesive material contains polar groups. Although natural adhesives (animal glue, casein, starch, and rosin) are still used for many applications, a host of new adhesive materials based on synthetic poly-mers have been developed; these include polyurethanes, polysiloxanes (silicones),epoxies, polyimides, acrylics, and rubber materials.

rubber materials. Adhesives may be used to joina large variety of materials—viz. metals, ceramics, polymers, composites, skin, etc.—and the choice of which adhesive to use will depend on such factors as (1) thematerials to be bonded and their porosities; (2) the required adhesive properties(i.e., whether the bond is to be temporary or permanent); (3) maximum/minimumexposure temperatures; and (4) processing conditions. For all but the pressure-sensitive adhesives (discussed below), the adhesive ma- terial is applied as a low-viscosity liquid, so as to cover evenly and completely theadherend surfaces, and allow for maximum bonding interactions. The actual bond-ing joint forms as the adhesive undergoes a liquid-to-solid transition (or cures),which may be accomplished through either a physical process (e.g., crystallization,solvent evaporation) or a chemical process [e.g., addition polymerization, conden-sation polymerization (Section 15.20), vulcanization]. Characteristics of a soundjoint should include high shear, peel, and fracture strengths.15.18 Miscellaneous Applications •555 adhesive1496T_c15_523-576 12/31/05 13:57 Page 5552nd REVISE PAGESAdhesive bonding offers some advantages over other joining technologies (e.g., riveting, bolting, and welding) including lighter weight, the ability to join dissimilar materials and thin components, better fatigue resistance, and lower manufacturingcosts. Furthermore, it is the technology of choice when exact positioning of com-ponents as well as processing speed are essential. The chief drawback of adhesivejoints is service temperature limitation; polymers maintain their mechanical integrityonly at relatively low temperatures, and strength decreases rapidly with increasingtemperature. The maximum temperature possible for continuous use for some ofthe newly-developed polymers is Adhesive joints are found in a large num-ber applications, especially in the aerospace, automotive, and construction indus-tries, in packaging, and some household goods.

household goods. A special class of this group of materials is the pressure-sensitive adhesives (or self-adhesive materials), such as those found on self-stick tapes, labels, and postagestamps. These materials are designed to adhere to just about any surface by makingcontact and with the application of slight pressure. Unlike the adhesives describedabove, bonding action does not result from a physical transformation or a chemicalreaction. Rather, these materials contain polymer tackifying resins; during detach-ment of the two bonding surfaces, small fibrils form that are attached to the surfacesand tend to hold them together. Polymers used for pressure-sensitive adhesives in-clude the acrylics, styrenic block copolymers (Section 15.19), and natural rubber. Films Polymeric materials have found widespread use in the form of thin films. Films hav- ing thicknesses between 0.025 and 0.125 mm (0.001 and 0.005 in.) are fabricatedand used extensively as bags for packaging food products and other merchandise,as textile products, and a host of other uses. Important characteristics of the mate-rials produced and used as films include low density, a high degree of flexibility,high tensile and tear strengths, resistance to attack by moisture and other chemi-cals, and low permeability to some gases, especially water vapor (Section 14.14).Some of the polymers that meet these criteria and are manufactured in film formare polyethylene, polypropylene, cellophane, and cellulose acetate. Foams Foams are plastic materials that contain a relatively high volume percentage of small pores and trapped gas bubbles. Both thermoplastic and thermosetting materials areused as foams; these include polyurethane, rubber, polystyrene, and poly(vinyl chlo-ride). Foams are commonly used as cushions in automobiles and furniture as wellas in packaging and thermal insulation.

thermal insulation. The foaming process is often carried out byincorporating into the batch of material a blowing agent that, upon heating, de-composes with the liberation of a gas. Gas bubbles are generated throughout thenow-fluid mass, which remain in the solid upon cooling and give rise to a sponge-like structure. The same effect is produced by dissolving an inert gas into a moltenpolymer under high pressure. When the pressure is rapidly reduced, the gas comesout of solution and forms bubbles and pores that remain in the solid as it cools. 15.19 ADVANCED POLYMERIC MATERIALS A number of new polymers having unique and desirable combinations of proper-ties have been developed over the past several years; many have found niches innew technologies and/or have satisfactorily replaced other materials. Some of theseinclude ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene, liquid crystal polymers, and ther-moplastic elastomers. Each of these will now be discussed.300/H11034C.556 •Chapter 15 / Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers foam1496T_c15_523-576 12/8/05 13:03 Page 556REVISED PAGESUltrahigh Molecular Weight Polyethylene Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is a linear polyethylene that has an extremely high molecular weight. Its typical is approximately g/mol, which is an order of magnitude (i.e., factor of ten) greater than that of high-density polyethylene. In fiber form, UHMWPE is highly aligned and has the tradename Spectra TM. Some of the extraordinary characteristics of this material are as follows: 1.An extremely high impact resistance 2.Outstanding resistance to wear and abrasion 3.A very low coefficient of friction 4.A self-lubricating and nonstick surface 5.Very good chemical resistance to normally encountered solvents 6.Excellent low-temperature properties 7.Outstanding sound damping and energy absorption characteristics 8.Electrically insulating and excellent dielectric properties However, since this material has a relatively low melting temperature, its me- chanical properties diminish rapidly with increasing temperature.

increasing temperature. This unusual combination of properties leads to numerous and diverse appli- cations for this material, including bullet-proof vests, composite military helmets, fishing line, ski-bottom surfaces, golf ball cores, bowling alley and ice skating rinksurfaces, biomedical prostheses (Section 22.12), blood filters, marking pen nibs, bulkmaterial handling equipment (for coal, grain, cement, gravel, etc. ), bushings, pumpimpellers, and valve gaskets. Liquid Crystal Polymers The liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) are a group of chemically complex and struc- turally distinct materials that have unique properties and are utilized in diverse ap-plications. Discussion of the chemistry of these materials is beyond the scope of thisbook. Suffice it to say that LCPs are composed of extended, rod-shaped, and rigidmolecules. In terms of molecular arrangement, these materials do not fall withinany of conventional liquid, amorphous, crystalline, or semicrystalline classifications,but may be considered as a new state of matter—the liquid crystalline state, beingneither crystalline nor liquid. In the melt (or liquid) condition, whereas other poly-mer molecules are randomly oriented, LCP molecules can become aligned in highlyordered configurations. As solids, this molecular alignment remains, and, in addi-tion, the molecules form in domain structures having characteristic intermolecularspacings. A schematic comparison of liquid crystals, amorphous polymers, and semi-crystalline polymers in both melt and solid states is illustrated in Figure 15.20.Furthermore, there are three types of liquid crystals, based on orientation and po-sitional ordering—smectic, nematic, and cholesteric; distinctions among these typesare also beyond the scope of this discussion. The principal use of liquid crystal polymers is in liquid crystal displays (LCDs) on digital watches, flat-panel computer monitors and televisions, and other digi-tal displays.

digi-tal displays. Here cholesteric types of LCPs are employed which, at room tem-perature, are fluid liquids, transparent, and optically anisotropic. The displays arecomposed of two sheets of glass between which is sandwiched the liquid crystalmaterial. The outer face of each glass sheet is coated with a transparent and4/H1100310 6Mw15.19 Advanced Polymeric Materials •557 ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) liquid crystal polymer1496T_c15_523-576 12/8/05 13:03 Page 557REVISED PAGESelectrically conductive film; in addition, the character-forming number/letter ele- ments are etched into this film on the side that is to be viewed. A voltage appliedthrough the conductive films (and thus between these two glass sheets) over oneof these character-forming regions causes a disruption of the orientation of theLCP molecules in this region, a darkening of this LCP material, and, in turn, theformation of a visible character. Some of the nematic type of liquid crystal polymers are rigid solids at room temperature and, on the basis of an outstanding combination of properties andprocessing characteristics, have found widespread use in a variety of commercialapplications. For example, these materials exhibit the following behaviors: 1.Excellent thermal stability; they may be used to temperatures as high as 2.Stiff and strong; their tensile moduli range between 10 and 24 GPa while tensile strengths are from 125 to 255 MPa (18,000 to 37,000 psi). 3.High impact strengths, which are retained upon cooling to relatively lowtemperatures. 4.Chemical inertness to a wide variety of acids, solvents, bleaches, etc. 5.Inherent flame resistance and combustion products that are relatively nontoxic. The thermal stability and chemical inertness of these materials are explained byextremely high intermolecular interactions.

These materials are used extensively by the electronics industry (interconnect devices, relay and capacitor housings, brackets, etc. ), by the medical equipment in- dustry (in components to be repeatedly sterilized), and in photocopiers and fiber-optic components. Thermoplastic Elastomers The thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs or TEs) are a type of polymeric material that, at ambient conditions, exhibits elastomeric (or rubbery) behavior, yet is thermo-plastic in nature (Section 14.9).

(Section 14.9). By way of contrast, most elastomers heretoforediscussed are thermosets, because they are crosslinked during vulcanization. Of theseveral varieties of TPEs, one of the best known and widely used is a block copoly-mer consisting of block segments of a hard and rigid thermoplastic (commonlystyrene [S]), that alternate with block segments of a soft and flexible elastic mate-rial (often butadiene [B] or isoprene [I]). For a common TPE, hard polymerizedsegments are located at chain ends, whereas each soft central region consists of poly-merized butadiene or isoprene units. These TPEs are frequently termed styrenic block copolymers, and chain chemistries for the two (S-B-S and S-I-S) types are shown in Figure 15.21 At ambient temperatures, the soft, amorphous, central (butadiene or isoprene) segments impart the rubbery, elastomeric behavior to the material. Furthermore,for temperatures below the of the hard (styrene) component, hard chain-endsegments from numerous adjacent chains aggregate together to form rigid crys-talline domain regions. These domains are “physical crosslinks” that act as anchorpoints so as to restrict soft-chain segment motions; they function in much the sameway as “chemical crosslinks” for the thermoset elastomers. A schematic illustrationfor the structure of this TPE type is presented in Figure 15.22. The tensile modulus of this TPE material is subject to alteration; increasing the number of soft-component blocks per chain will lead to a decrease in modulus and,therefore, a diminishment of stiffness. Furthermore, the useful temperature rangelies between of the soft and flexible component and of the hard, rigid one.

tomeric polyamides. The chief advantage of the TPEs over the thermoset elastomers is that upon heating above of the hard phase, they melt (i.e., the physical crosslinks disap-pear), and, therefore, they may be processed by conventional thermoplastic form-ing techniques [e.g., blow molding, injection molding, etc. (Section 15.22)]; thermosetpolymers do not experience melting, and, consequently, forming is normally moredifficult. Furthermore, since the melting-solidification process is reversible and re-peatable for thermoplastic elastomers, TPE parts may be reformed into othershapes. In other words, they are recyclable; thermoset elastomers are, to a large de-gree, nonrecyclable. Scrap that is generated during forming procedures may also berecycled, which results in lower production costs than with thermosets. In addition,tighter controls may be maintained on part dimensions for TPEs, and TPEs havelower densities. In quite a variety of applications, the thermoplastic elastomers have replaced the conventional thermoset elastomers. Typical uses for the TPEs include automo-tive exterior trim (bumpers, fascia, etc. ), automotive underhood components (elec-trical insulation and connectors, and gaskets), shoe soles and heels, sporting goods(e.g., bladders for footballs and soccer balls), medical barrier films and protectivecoatings, and as components in sealants, caulking, and adhesives.

Finally, a finished piece having a desired shape must be fashioned during a forming operation. This section treats polymerizationprocesses and the various forms of additives, as well as specific forming procedures. 15.20 POLYMERIZATION The synthesis of these large molecules (polymers) is termed polymerization; it is simply the process by which monomers are linked together to generate long chainscomposed of repeat units. Most generally, the raw materials for synthetic polymersare derived from coal, natural gas, and petroleum products. The reactions by whichpolymerization occur are grouped into two general classifications—addition andcondensation—according to the reaction mechanism, as discussed below. Addition Polymerization Addition polymerization (sometimes called chain reaction polymerization) is a process by which monomer units are attached one at a time in chainlike fashion toform a linear macromolecule. The composition of the resultant product molecule isan exact multiple for that of the original reactant monomer. Three distinct stages—initiation, propagation, and termination—are involved in addition polymerization. During the initiation step, an active center capable ofpropagation is formed by a reaction between an initiator (or catalyst) species andthe monomer unit. This process has already been demonstrated for polyethylene(Equation 14.1), which is repeated as follows:15.20 Polymerization •561 C R·/H11001 HH C HHC R HHC· HH(15.5) (15.6)Again, R/H11080 represents the active initiator, and is an unpaired electron.

unpaired electron. Propagation involves the linear growth of the polymer chain by the sequential addition of monomer units to this active growing chain molecule. This may be rep- resented, again for polyethylene, as follows:/H11080 C /H11001 R HHC· HHC HHC HHC HHC HHC HHC· HHR Chain growth is relatively rapid; the period required to grow a molecule consisting of, say, 1000 repeat units is on the order of to s. Propagation may end or terminate in different ways. First, the active ends of two propagating chains may link together to form one molecule according to the following reaction:6 (15.7) CHH HHC· ( CHHHH C )m ·C RHHHH C R ( CHHHH C )n /H11001 CHHHH ( CHHHH C )m C RHHHH C R C ( CHHHH C )n10/H11002310/H110022addition polymerization 6This type of termination reaction is referred to as combination.1496T_c15_523-576 12/31/05 13:57 Page 5612nd REVISE PAGESThe other termination possibility involves two growing molecules that react to form two “dead chains” as7 (15.8) thus terminating the growth of each chain. Molecular weight is governed by the relative rates of initiation, propagation, and termination. Ordinarily, they are controlled to ensure the production of a poly-mer having the desired degree of polymerization. Addition polymerization is used in the synthesis of polyethylene, polypropyl- ene, poly(vinyl chloride), and polystyrene, as well as many of the copolymers.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Condensation Polymerization Condensation (or step reaction) polymerization is the formation of polymers by stepwise intermolecular chemical reactions that may involve more than one monomer species. There is usually a small molecular weight byproduct such as wa-ter that is eliminated (or condensed). No reactant species has the chemical formulaof the repeat unit, and the intermolecular reaction occurs every time a repeat unitis formed. For example, consider the formation of the polyester, poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET), from the reaction between ethylene glycol and terephthalicacid; the intermolecular reaction is as follows: (15.9) HOH HC CHHOHOHH C CHHOH Ethylene glycol Terephthalic acid O C OH HOO C O C OH /H11001 H2OO C+CHH HHC· ( CHHHH C )m ·C RHHHH C R ( CHHHH C )n /H11001 CHHH ( CHHHH C )m C RHHH C R ( CHHHH C )n /H11001 CHH562 •Chapter 15 / Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers 7This type of termination reaction is called disproportionation.condensation polymerization1496T_c15_523-576 12/31/05 13:57 Page 5622nd REVISE PAGESThis stepwise process is successively repeated, producing a linear molecule. The chemistry of the specific reaction is not important but the condensation polymer-ization mechanism is. Furthermore, reaction times for condensation are generallylonger than for addition polymerization.

addition polymerization. For the previous condensation reaction, both ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid are bifunctional. However, condensation reactions can include trifunctional orhigher functional monomers capable of forming crosslinked and network polymers.The thermosetting polyesters and phenol-formaldehyde, the nylons, and the poly-carbonates are produced by condensation polymerization. Some polymers, such asnylon, may be polymerized by either technique. Concept Check 15.12 Nylon 6,6 may be formed by means of a condensation polymerization reaction inwhich hexamethylene diamine [NH 2—(CH 2)6—NH 2] and adipic acid react with one another with the formation of water as a byproduct.

Note: the structure for adipic acid is [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 15.21 POLYMER ADDITIVES Most of the properties of polymers discussed earlier in this chapter are intrinsicones—that is, characteristic of or fundamental to the specific polymer. Some of theseproperties are related to and controlled by the molecular structure. Many times,however, it is necessary to modify the mechanical, chemical, and physical proper-ties to a much greater degree than is possible by the simple alteration of this fun-damental molecular structure. Foreign substances called additives are intentionally introduced to enhance or modify many of these properties, and thus render a poly-mer more serviceable. Typical additives include filler materials, plasticizers, stabi-lizers, colorants, and flame retardants. Fillers Filler materials are most often added to polymers to improve tensile and compressive strengths, abrasion resistance, toughness, dimensional and thermal stability, and otherproperties. Materials used as particulate fillers include wood flour (finely powderedsawdust), silica flour and sand, glass, clay, talc, limestone, and even some synthetic poly-mers.

synthetic poly-mers. Particle sizes range all the way from 10 nm to macroscopic dimensions. Polymersthat contain fillers may also be classified as composite materials, which are discussedin Chapter 16. Often the fillers are inexpensive materials that replace some volume ofthe more expensive polymer, reducing the cost of the final product. Plasticizers The flexibility, ductility, and toughness of polymers may be improved with the aidof additives called plasticizers. Their presence also produces reductions in hardness and stiffness. Plasticizers are generally liquids having low vapor pressures and lowH HC CHHHH C HO CHH OHO CO C15.21 Polymer Additives •563 filler plasticizer1496T_c15_523-576 12/8/05 13:03 Page 563REVISED PAGESmolecular weights. The small plasticizer molecules occupy positions between the large polymer chains, effectively increasing the interchain distance with a reductionin the secondary intermolecular bonding. Plasticizers are commonly used in poly-mers that are intrinsically brittle at room temperature, such as poly(vinyl chloride)and some of the acetate copolymers. The plasticizer lowers the glass transition tem-perature, so that at ambient conditions the polymers may be used in applicationsrequiring some degree of pliability and ductility. These applications include thinsheets or films, tubing, raincoats, and curtains. Concept Check 15.13 (a)Why must the vapor pressure of a plasticizer be relatively low? (b)How will the crystallinity of a polymer be affected by the addition of a plasti-cizer? Why? (c)How does the addition of a plasticizer influence the tensile strength of apolymer? Why? [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Stabilizers Some polymeric materials, under normal environmental conditions, are subject torapid deterioration, generally in terms of mechanical integrity.

mechanical integrity. Additives that coun-teract deteriorative processes are called stabilizers. One common form of deterioration results from exposure to light [in particu- lar ultraviolet (UV) radiation]. Ultraviolet radiation interacts with and causes a sev-erance of some of the covalent bonds along the molecular chains, which may alsoresult in some crosslinking. There are two primary approaches to UV stabilization.The first is to add a UV absorbent material, often as a thin layer at the surface. Thisessentially acts as a sunscreen and blocks out the UV radiation before it can pen-etrate into and damage the polymer. The second approach is to add materials thatreact with the bonds broken by UV radiation before they can participate in otherreactions that lead to additional polymer damage. Another important type of deterioration is oxidation (Section 17.12). It is a con- sequence of the chemical interaction between oxygen [as either diatomic oxygen(O 2) or ozone (O 3)] and the polymer molecules. Stabilizers that protect against oxidation either consume oxygen before it reaches the polymer, and/or they pre-vent the occurrence of oxidation reactions that would further damage the material. Colorants Colorants impart a specific color to a polymer; they may be added in the form of dyes or pigments. The molecules in a dye actually dissolve in the polymer. Pigmentsare filler materials that do not dissolve, but remain as a separate phase; normallythey have a small particle size and a refractive index near to that of the parent poly-mer. Others may impart opacity as well as color to the polymer. Flame Retardants The flammability of polymeric materials is a major concern, especially in the man-ufacture of textiles and children’s toys. Most polymers are flammable in their pureform; exceptions include those containing significant contents of chlorine and/orfluorine, such as poly(vinyl chloride) and polytetrafluoroethylene.

and polytetrafluoroethylene. The flammability564 •Chapter 15 / Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers stabilizer colorant1496T_c15_523-576 12/8/05 13:03 Page 564REVISED PAGESresistance of the remaining combustible polymers may be enhanced by additives called flame retardants. These retardants may function by interfering with the combustion process through the gas phase, or by initiating a different combustionreaction that generates less heat, thereby reducing the temperature; this causes aslowing or cessation of burning. 15.22 FORMING TECHNIQUES FOR PLASTICS Quite a variety of different techniques are employed in the forming of polymeric ma-terials.The method used for a specific polymer depends on several factors: (1) whetherthe material is thermoplastic or thermosetting; (2) if thermoplastic, the temperature atwhich it softens; (3) the atmospheric stability of the material being formed; and (4) thegeometry and size of the finished product. There are numerous similarities betweensome of these techniques and those utilized for fabricating metals and ceramics. Fabrication of polymeric materials normally occurs at elevated temperatures and often by the application of pressure. Thermoplastics are formed above theirglass transition temperatures, if amorphous, or above their melting temperatures, ifsemicrystalline. An applied pressure must be maintained as the piece is cooled sothat the formed article will retain its shape. One significant economic benefit of us-ing thermoplastics is that they may be recycled; scrap thermoplastic pieces may beremelted and reformed into new shapes. Fabrication of thermosetting polymers is ordinarily accomplished in two stages. First comes the preparation of a linear polymer (sometimes called a prepolymer)as a liquid, having a low molecular weight. This material is converted into the finalhard and stiff product during the second stage, which is normally carried out in amold having the desired shape.

desired shape. This second stage, termed “curing,” may occur dur-ing heating and/or by the addition of catalysts, and often under pressure. Duringcuring, chemical and structural changes occur on a molecular level: a crosslinked ora network structure forms. After curing, thermoset polymers may be removed froma mold while still hot, since they are now dimensionally stable. Thermosets are dif-ficult to recycle, do not melt, are usable at higher temperatures than thermoplas-tics, and are often more chemically inert. Molding is the most common method for forming plastic polymers. The sev- eral molding techniques used include compression, transfer, blow, injection, andextrusion molding. For each, a finely pelletized or granulized plastic is forced, atan elevated temperature and by pressure, to flow into, fill, and assume the shapeof a mold cavity. Compression and Transfer Molding For compression molding, the appropriate amounts of thoroughly mixed polymerand necessary additives are placed between male and female mold members, asillustrated in Figure 15.23. Both mold pieces are heated; however, only one is mov-able. The mold is closed, and heat and pressure are applied, causing the plastic tobecome viscous and flow to conform to the mold shape. Before molding, raw ma-terials may be mixed and cold pressed into a disc, which is called a preform. Pre-heating of the preform reduces molding time and pressure, extends the die lifetime,and produces a more uniform finished piece. This molding technique lends itself tothe fabrication of both thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers; however, its usewith thermoplastics is more time-consuming and expensive than the more com-monly used extrusion or injection molding techniques discussed below.

As the molten material is injected into the15.22 Forming Techniques for Plastics •565 flame retardant molding1496T_c15_523-576 12/8/05 13:03 Page 565REVISED PAGESmold chamber, the pressure is distributed more uniformly over all surfaces.This process is used with thermosetting polymers and for pieces having complex geometries. Injection Molding Injection molding, the polymer analogue of die casting for metals, is the most widelyused technique for fabricating thermoplastic materials. A schematic cross section ofthe apparatus used is illustrated in Figure 15.24. The correct amount of pelletizedmaterial is fed from a feed hopper into a cylinder by the motion of a plunger or ram.This charge is pushed forward into a heating chamber where it is forced around aspreader so as to make better contact with the heated wall. As a result, the ther-moplastic material melts to form a viscous liquid. Next, the molten plastic is impelled,again by ram motion, through a nozzle into the enclosed mold cavity; pressure ismaintained until the molding has solidified. Finally, the mold is opened, the piece isejected, the mold is closed, and the entire cycle is repeated. Probably the most out-standing feature of this technique is the speed with which pieces may be produced.For thermoplastics, solidification of the injected charge is almost immediate; conse-quently, cycle times for this process are short (commonly within the range of 10 to30 s).Thermosetting polymers may also be injection molded; curing takes place whilethe material is under pressure in a heated mold, which results in longer cycle timesthan for thermoplastics. This process is sometimes termed reaction injection mold-ing (RIM) and is commonly used for materials such as polyurethane. Extrusion The extrusion process is the molding of a viscous thermoplastic under pressurethrough an open-ended die, similar to the extrusion of metals (Figure 11.8 c).

Extrusion takes place as this molten mass is forced through adie orifice. Solidification of the extruded length is expedited by blowers, a waterspray, or bath. The technique is especially adapted to producing continuous lengthshaving constant cross-sectional geometries—for example, rods, tubes, hose channels,sheets, and filaments. Blow Molding The blow-molding process for the fabrication of plastic containers is similar to thatused for blowing glass bottles, as represented in Figure 13.8. First, a parison, orlength of polymer tubing, is extruded. While still in a semimolten state, the parisonis placed in a two-piece mold having the desired container configuration.The hollowpiece is formed by blowing air or steam under pressure into the parison, forcing thetube walls to conform to the contours of the mold.

the mold. Of course the temperature andviscosity of the parison must be carefully regulated. Casting Like metals, polymeric materials may be cast, as when a molten plastic material ispoured into a mold and allowed to solidify. Both thermoplastic and thermosettingplastics may be cast. For thermoplastics, solidification occurs upon cooling from themolten state; however, for thermosets, hardening is a consequence of the actual poly-merization or curing process, which is usually carried out at an elevated temperature. 15.23 FABRICATION OF ELASTOMERS Techniques used in the actual fabrication of rubber parts are essentially the same asthose discussed for plastics as described above—that is, compression molding, ex-trusion, and so on. Furthermore, most rubber materials are vulcanized (Section 15.9)and some are reinforced with carbon black (Section 16.2). Concept Check 15.14 For a rubber component that, in its final form is to be vulcanized, should vulcan-ization be carried out prior to or subsequent to the forming operation? Why?

termed spinning. Most often, fibers are spun from the molten state in a process called melt spinning. The material to be spun is first heated until it forms a relatively viscousliquid. Next, it is pumped through a plate called a spinneret, which contains nu-merous small, typically round holes. As the molten material passes through eachof these orifices, a single fiber is formed, which is rapidly solidified by cooling withair blowers or a water bath. The crystallinity of a spun fiber will depend on its rate of cooling during spin- ning. The strength of fibers is improved by a postforming process called drawing,as discussed in Section 15.8. Again, drawing is simply the permanent mechanicalelongation of a fiber in the direction of its axis. During this process the molecularchains become oriented in the direction of drawing (Figure 15.13 d), such that the tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and toughness are improved. The cross sec-tion of melt spun, drawn fibers is nearly circular, and the properties are uniformthroughout the cross section. Two other techniques that involve producing fibers from solutions of dissolved polymers are dry spinning and wet spinning. For dry spinning the polymer is dis- solved in a volatile solvent. The polymer-solvent solution is then pumped througha spinneret into a heated zone; here the fibers solidify as the solvent evaporates. Inwet spinning, the fibers are formed by passing a polymer-solvent solution througha spinneret directly into a second solvent that causes the polymer fiber to come outof (i.e., precipitate from) the solution. For both of these techniques, a skin first formson the surface of the fiber. Subsequently, some shrinkage occurs such that the fibershrivels up (like a raisin); this leads to a very irregular cross-section profile, whichcauses the fiber to become stiffer (i.e., increases the modulus of elasticity).568 •Chapter 15 / Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers spinning ExtrudateHeatersAir bubble Tubing die AirPinch rolls Guide rolls Bags, film, and sheetAirAir bubble Figure 15.26 Schematic diagram of an apparatus that is used to form thin polymer films.

Alternatively, film may be blown: continuous tubing is extrudedthrough an annular die; then, by maintaining a carefully controlled positive gas pres-sure inside the tube and by drawing the film in the axial direction as it emergesfrom the die, the material expands around this trapped air bubble like a balloon(Figure 15.26). As a result the wall thickness is continuously reduced to produce athin cylindrical film which can be sealed at the end to make garbage bags, or whichmay be cut and laid flat to make a film. This is termed a biaxial drawing processand produces films that are strong in both stretching directions. Some of the newerfilms are produced by coextrusion; that is, multilayers of more than one polymertype are extruded simultaneously. SUMMARY Stress–Strain Behavior On the basis of stress–strain behavior, polymers fall within three general classifi- cations: brittle, plastic, and highly elastic. These materials are neither as strong noras stiff as metals, and their mechanical properties are sensitive to changes in tem-perature and strain rate. However, their high flexibilities, low densities, and resis-tance to corrosion make them the materials of choice for many applications. Viscoelastic Deformation Viscoelastic mechanical behavior, being intermediate between totally elastic and totally viscous, is displayed by a number of polymeric materials. It is characterizedby the relaxation modulus, a time-dependent modulus of elasticity.

of elasticity. The magnitudeof the relaxation modulus is very sensitive to temperature; critical to the in-servicetemperature range for elastomers is this temperature dependence. Fracture of Polymers Fracture strengths of polymeric materials are low relative to metals and ceramics. Both brittle and ductile fracture modes are possible, and some thermoplastic ma-terials experience a ductile-to-brittle transition with a lowering of temperature, anincrease in strain rate, and/or an alteration of specimen thickness or geometry. Insome thermoplastics, the crack-formation process may be preceded by crazing; craz-ing can lead to an increase in ductility and toughness of the material. Deformation of Semicrystalline Polymers During the elastic deformation of a semicrystalline polymer having a spherulitic structure that is stressed in tension, the molecules in amorphous regions elongatein the stress direction. In addition, molecules in crystallites experience bending andstretching, which causes a slight increase in lamellar thickness. The mechanism of plastic deformation for spherulitic polymers was also pre- sented. Tensile deformation occurs in several stages as both amorphous tie chainsand chain-folded block segments (which separate from the ribbon-like lamellae)become oriented with the tensile axis. Also, during deformation the shapes ofSummary •569 1496T_c15_523-576 12/31/05 13:57 Page 5692nd REVISE PAGESspherulites are altered (for moderate deformations); relatively large degrees of deformation lead to a complete destruction of the spherulites to form highly alignedstructures. Furthermore, the predeformed spherulitic structure and macroscopicshape may be partially restored by annealing at an elevated temperature below thepolymer’s melting temperature. Factors That Influence the Mechanical Properties of Semicrystalline Polymers The mechanical behavior of a polymer will be influenced by both in-service and struc- tural/processing factors.

tural/processing factors. With regard to the former, increasing the temperature and/ordiminishing the strain rate leads to reductions in tensile modulus and tensile strengthand an enhancement of ductility. In addition, other factors that affect the mechanicalproperties include molecular weight, degree of crystallinity, predeformation drawing,and heat treating. The influence of each of these factors was discussed. Deformation of Elastomers Large elastic extensions are possible for the elastomeric materials that are amor- phous and lightly crosslinked. Deformation corresponds to the unkinking and un-coiling of chains in response to an applied tensile stress. Crosslinking is oftenachieved during a vulcanization process. Many of the elastomers are copolymers,whereas the silicone elastomers are really inorganic materials. Crystallization MeltingThe Glass TransitionMelting and Glass Transition TemperaturesFactors That Influence Melting and Glass Transition Temperatures The molecular mechanics of crystallization, melting, and the glass transition were discussed. The manner in which melting and glass transition temperatures are de-termined was outlined; these parameters are important relative to the temperaturerange over which a particular polymer may be utilized and processed. The magni-tudes of and increase with increasing chain stiffness; stiffness is enhanced bythe presence of chain double bonds and side groups that are either bulky or polar.Molecular weight and degree of branching also affect and Plastics The various types and applications of polymeric materials were also discussed. Plas- tic materials are perhaps the most widely used group of polymers, which includethe following: polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl chloride), polystyrene, andthe fluorocarbons, epoxies, phenolics, and polyesters. Fibers Many polymeric materials may be spun into fibers, which are used primarily in tex- tiles. Mechanical, thermal, and chemical characteristics of these materials are espe-cially critical.

These materi-als have unusual properties and are used in a host of high-technology applications. Polymerization Polymer Additives The final sections of this chapter treated synthesis and fabrication techniques for polymeric materials. Synthesis of large molecular weight polymers is attained bypolymerization, of which there are two types: addition and condensation. The prop-erties of polymers may be further modified by using additives; these include fillers,plasticizers, stabilizers, colorants, and flame retardants. Forming Techniques for Plastics Fabrication of plastic polymers is usually accomplished by shaping the material in molten form at an elevated temperature, using at least one of several different mold-ing techniques—compression, transfer, injection, and blow. Extrusion and castingare also possible. Fabrication of Fibers and Films Some fibers are spun from a viscous melt, after which they are plastically elongated during a drawing operation, which improves the mechanical strength. Films areformed by extrusion and blowing, or by calendering.References •571 IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS Addition polymerizationAdhesiveColorantCondensation polymerizationDrawingElastomerFiberFillerFlame retardantFoamGlass transition temperatureLiquid crystal polymerMelting temperatureMoldingPlasticizerPlasticRelaxation modulusSpinningStabilizerThermoplastic elastomerUltrahigh molecular weight polyethylene ViscoelasticityVulcanization REFERENCES Billmeyer, F.

This is especially true for materials that are needed for aerospace, under-water, and transportation applications. For example, aircraft engineers are increasinglysearching for structural materials that have low densities, are strong, stiff, and abrasionand impact resistant, and are not easily corroded. This is a rather formidable combina-tion of characteristics. Frequently, strong materials are relatively dense; also, increasingthe strength or stiffness generally results in a decrease in impact strength. Material property combinations and ranges have been, and are yet being, ex- tended by the development of composite materials. Generally speaking, a compositeis considered to be any multiphase material that exhibits a significant proportionof the properties of both constituent phases such that a better combination of prop-erties is realized.

is realized. According to this principle of combined action, better property combinations are fashioned by the judicious combination of two or more distinctmaterials. Property trade-offs are also made for many composites. Composites of sorts have already been discussed; these include multiphase metal alloys, ceramics, and polymers. For example, pearlitic steels (Section 9.19)have a microstructure consisting of alternating layers of ferrite and cementite(Figure 9.27). The ferrite phase is soft and ductile, whereas cementite is hard andvery brittle. The combined mechanical characteristics of the pearlite (reasonablyhigh ductility and strength) are superior to those of either of the constituent phases.There are also a number of composites that occur in nature. For example, woodconsists of strong and flexible cellulose fibers surrounded and held together by astiffer material called lignin. Also, bone is a composite of the strong yet soft pro-tein collagen and the hard, brittle mineral apatite. A composite, in the present context, is a multiphase material that is artificially made, as opposed to one that occurs or forms naturally. In addition, the constituent phases must be chemically dissimilar and separated by a distinct interface. Thus,most metallic alloys and many ceramics do not fit this definition because their mul-tiple phases are formed as a consequence of natural phenomena. In designing composite materials, scientists and engineers have ingeniously combined various metals, ceramics, and polymers to produce a new generation ofaLearning Objectives After careful study of this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1.Name the three main divisions of composite materials, and cite the distinguishing feature ofeach. 2.Cite the difference in strengthening mechanismfor large-particle and dispersion-strengthenedparticle-reinforced composites. 3.Distinguish the three different types of fiber-reinforced composites on the basis of fiber lengthand orientation; comment on the distinctive me-chanical characteristics for each type.

Most composites have been created to improve combina- tions of mechanical characteristics such as stiffness, toughness, and ambient andhigh-temperature strength. Many composite materials are composed of just two phases; one is termed the matrix, which is continuous and surrounds the other phase, often called the dispersed phase. The properties of composites are a function of the properties of the con- stituent phases, their relative amounts, and the geometry of the dispersed phase.“Dispersed phase geometry” in this context means the shape of the particles andthe particle size, distribution, and orientation; these characteristics are representedin Figure 16.1. One simple scheme for the classification of composite materials is shown in Fig- ure 16.2, which consists of three main divisions: particle-reinforced, fiber-reinforced,16.1 Introduction •579 Dispersed phaseMatrix phase (c) (b) (a) (d) (e) Figure 16.1 Schematic representations of the various geometrical and spatial characteristics of particles of the dispersed phase that may influence the properties of composites: ( a) concentration, (b) size, (c) shape, (d) distribution, and (e) orientation.

The dis- persed phase for particle-reinforced composites is equiaxed (i.e., particle dimen-sions are approximately the same in all directions); for fiber-reinforced composites,the dispersed phase has the geometry of a fiber (i.e., a large length-to-diameter ratio).Structural composites are combinations of composites and homogeneous materials.The discussion of the remainder of this chapter will be organized according to thisclassification scheme. Particle-Reinforced Composites As noted in Figure 16.2, large-particle and dispersion-strengthened composites are the two subclassifications of particle-reinforced composites. The distinctionbetween these is based upon reinforcement or strengthening mechanism.The term“large” is used to indicate that particle–matrix interactions cannot be treated onthe atomic or molecular level; rather, continuum mechanics is used. For most ofthese composites, the particulate phase is harder and stiffer than the matrix. Thesereinforcing particles tend to restrain movement of the matrix phase in the vicinityof each particle. In essence, the matrix transfers some of the applied stress to theparticles, which bear a fraction of the load.

the load. The degree of reinforcement or im-provement of mechanical behavior depends on strong bonding at the matrix–particleinterface. For dispersion-strengthened composites, particles are normally much smaller, with diameters between 0.01 and 0.1 m (10 and 100 nm). Particle–matrix interac-tions that lead to strengthening occur on the atomic or molecular level. The mech-anism of strengthening is similar to that for precipitation hardening discussed inSection 11.9. Whereas the matrix bears the major portion of an applied load, thesmall dispersed particles hinder or impede the motion of dislocations. Thus, plasticdeformation is restricted such that yield and tensile strengths, as well as hardness,improve. 16.2 LARGE–PARTICLE COMPOSITES Some polymeric materials to which fillers have been added (Section 15.21) are reallylarge-particle composites. Again, the fillers modify or improve the properties of thematerial and/or replace some of the polymer volume with a less expensive material—the filler. Another familiar large-particle composite is concrete, which is composed of ce- ment (the matrix), and sand and gravel (the particulates). Concrete is the discussiontopic of a succeeding section. Particles can have quite a variety of geometries, but they should be of approx- imately the same dimension in all directions (equiaxed). For effective reinforcement,the particles should be small and evenly distributed throughout the matrix. Fur-thermore, the volume fraction of the two phases influences the behavior; mechanicalproperties are enhanced with increasing particulate content. Two mathematicalexpressions have been formulated for the dependence of the elastic modulus on thevolume fraction of the constituent phases for a two-phase composite. These rule of mixtures equations predict that the elastic modulus should fall between an upper bound represented by (16.1) E c1u2/H11005EmVm/H11001EpVpm580 •Chapter 16 / Composites large-particle composite dispersion- strengthened composite rule of mixtures For a two-phase composite, modulusof elasticity upper-bound expression1496T_c16_577-620 12/13/05 9:33 Page 580REVISED PAGES55 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 Modulus of elasticity (106 psi)Modulus of elasticity (GPa) 0 2 04 06 08 0 1 0 0 Tungsten concentration (vol%)350 300 250 200 150Upper bound Lower boundFigure 16.3 Modulus of elasticity versus volume percent tungsten for acomposite of tungstenparticles dispersed within acopper matrix.

Figure 16.3 plots upper- and lower-bound -versus- curves for a copper–tungsten composite, in which tungsten is the particulate phase;experimental data points fall between the two curves. Equations analogous to 16.1and 16.2 for fiber-reinforced composites are derived in Section 16.5. Large-particle composites are utilized with all three material types (metals, poly- mers, and ceramics). The cermets are examples of ceramic–metal composites. The most common cermet is the cemented carbide, which is composed of extremely hardparticles of a refractory carbide ceramic such as tungsten carbide (WC) or titaniumcarbide (TiC), embedded in a matrix of a metal such as cobalt or nickel. These com-posites are utilized extensively as cutting tools for hardened steels.The hard carbideparticles provide the cutting surface but, being extremely brittle, are not themselvescapable of withstanding the cutting stresses.Toughness is enhanced by their inclusionin the ductile metal matrix, which isolates the carbide particles from one anotherand prevents particle-to-particle crack propagation. Both matrix and particulatephases are quite refractory, to withstand the high temperatures generated by thecutting action on materials that are extremely hard. No single material could pos-sibly provide the combination of properties possessed by a cermet.

a cermet. Relatively largevolume fractions of the particulate phase may be utilized, often exceeding 90 vol%;thus the abrasive action of the composite is maximized. A photomicrograph of aWC–Co cemented carbide is shown in Figure 16.4. Both elastomers and plastics are frequently reinforced with various particulate materials. Our use of many of the modern rubbers would be severely restricted with-out reinforcing particulate materials such as carbon black. Carbon black consists ofvery small and essentially spherical particles of carbon, produced by the combustionof natural gas or oil in an atmosphere that has only a limited air supply.When addedto vulcanized rubber, this extremely inexpensive material enhances tensile strength,toughness, and tear and abrasion resistance. Automobile tires contain on the orderof 15 to 30 vol% of carbon black.

Particle reinforce-ment using other materials (e.g., silica) is much less effective because this specialinteraction between the rubber molecules and particle surfaces does not exist. Fig-ure 16.5 is an electron micrograph of a carbon black-reinforced rubber. Concrete Concrete is a common large-particle composite in which both matrix and dispersed phases are ceramic materials. Since the terms “concrete” and “cement” are sometimesincorrectly interchanged, perhaps it is appropriate to make a distinction between them.In a broad sense, concrete implies a composite material consisting of an aggregate ofparticles that are bound together in a solid body by some type of binding medium,that is, a cement.

Asphaltic concrete is widely used primarily as a paving material, whereas portland cement concrete is employedextensively as a structural building material. Only the latter is treated in this discussion. Portland Cement Concrete The ingredients for this concrete are portland cement, a fine aggregate (sand), acoarse aggregate (gravel), and water. The process by which portland cement is pro-duced and the mechanism of setting and hardening were discussed very briefly inSection 13.7. The aggregate particles act as a filler material to reduce the overallcost of the concrete product because they are cheap, whereas cement is relativelyexpensive. To achieve the optimum strength and workability of a concrete mixture,the ingredients must be added in the correct proportions. Dense packing of the ag-gregate and good interfacial contact are achieved by having particles of two dif-ferent sizes; the fine particles of sand should fill the void spaces between the gravelparticles. Ordinarily these aggregates comprise between 60% and 80% of the totalvolume. The amount of cement–water paste should be sufficient to coat all the sandand gravel particles, otherwise the cementitious bond will be incomplete.

be incomplete. Further-more, all the constituents should be thoroughly mixed. Complete bonding betweencement and the aggregate particles is contingent upon the addition of the correctquantity of water. Too little water leads to incomplete bonding, and too much re-sults in excessive porosity; in either case the final strength is less than the optimum. The character of the aggregate particles is an important consideration. In partic- ular, the size distribution of the aggregates influences the amount of cement–waterpaste required. Also, the surfaces should be clean and free from clay and silt, whichprevent the formation of a sound bond at the particle surface. Portland cement concrete is a major material of construction, primarily because it can be poured in place and hardens at room temperature, and even when sub-merged in water. However, as a structural material, there are some limitations anddisadvantages. Like most ceramics, portland cement concrete is relatively weak andextremely brittle; its tensile strength is approximately 10 to 15 times smaller thanits compressive strength. Also, large concrete structures can experience consider-able thermal expansion and contraction with temperature fluctuations. In addition,water penetrates into external pores, which can cause severe cracking in coldweather as a consequence of freeze–thaw cycles. Most of these inadequacies maybe eliminated or at least improved by reinforcement and/or the incorporation ofadditives. Reinforced Concrete The strength of portland cement concrete may be increased by additional rein-forcement. This is usually accomplished by means of steel rods, wires, bars (rebar),or mesh, which are embedded into the fresh and uncured concrete. Thus, the rein-forcement renders the hardened structure capable of supporting greater tensile,compressive, and shear stresses. Even if cracks develop in the concrete, consider-able reinforcement is maintained. Steel serves as a suitable reinforcement material because its coefficient of ther- mal expansion is nearly the same as that of concrete. In addition, steel is not rapidlycorroded in the cement environment, and a relatively strong adhesive bond isformed between it and the cured concrete.

cured concrete. This adhesion may be enhanced by theincorporation of contours into the surface of the steel member, which permits agreater degree of mechanical interlocking. Portland cement concrete may also be reinforced by mixing into the fresh con- crete fibers of a high-modulus material such as glass, steel, nylon, and polyethylene.16.2 Large–Particle Composites •583 1496T_c16_577-620 12/9/05 17:14 Page 583REVISED PAGESCare must be exercised in utilizing this type of reinforcement, since some fiber ma- terials experience rapid deterioration when exposed to the cement environment. Still another reinforcement technique for strengthening concrete involves the introduction of residual compressive stresses into the structural member; the re-sulting material is called prestressed concrete. This method utilizes one characteristic of brittle ceramics—namely, that they are stronger in compression than in tension.Thus, to fracture a prestressed concrete member, the magnitude of the precom-pressive stress must be exceeded by an applied tensile stress. In one such prestressing technique, high-strength steel wires are positioned inside the empty molds and stretched with a high tensile force, which is maintained constant.After the concrete has been placed and allowed to harden, the tension is released.As the wires contract, they put the structure in a state of compression because thestress is transmitted to the concrete via the concrete–wire bond that is formed. Another technique is also utilized in which stresses are applied after the con- crete hardens; it is appropriately called posttensioning. Sheet metal or rubber tubes are situated inside and pass through the concrete forms, around which the concreteis cast. After the cement has hardened, steel wires are fed through the resultingholes, and tension is applied to the wires by means of jacks attached and abuttedto the faces of the structure. Again, a compressive stress is imposed on the concretepiece, this time by the jacks.

the jacks. Finally, the empty spaces inside the tubing are filledwith a grout to protect the wire from corrosion. Concrete that is prestressed should be of a high quality, with a low shrinkage and a low creep rate. Prestressed concretes, usually prefabricated, are commonlyused for highway and railway bridges. 16.3 DISPERSION-STRENGTHENED COMPOSITES Metals and metal alloys may be strengthened and hardened by the uniform disper-sion of several volume percent of fine particles of a very hard and inert material. Thedispersed phase may be metallic or nonmetallic; oxide materials are often used.Again,the strengthening mechanism involves interactions between the particles and dislo-cations within the matrix, as with precipitation hardening. The dispersion strength-ening effect is not as pronounced as with precipitation hardening; however, thestrengthening is retained at elevated temperatures and for extended time periods be-cause the dispersed particles are chosen to be unreactive with the matrix phase. Forprecipitation-hardened alloys, the increase in strength may disappear upon heat treat-ment as a consequence of precipitate growth or dissolution of the precipitate phase. The high-temperature strength of nickel alloys may be enhanced significantly by the addition of about 3 vol% of thoria (ThO 2) as finely dispersed particles; this material is known as thoria-dispersed (or TD) nickel. The same effect is producedin the aluminum–aluminum oxide system.A very thin and adherent alumina coatingis caused to form on the surface of extremely small (0.1 to 0.2 m thick) flakes ofaluminum, which are dispersed within an aluminum metal matrix; this material istermed sintered aluminum powder (SAP).

Design goals of fiber-reinforced composites often include high strength and/or stiffness on a weight basis. These characteristics are ex-pressed in terms of specific strength and specific modulus parameters, which cor- respond, respectively, to the ratios of tensile strength to specific gravity and modulusof elasticity to specific gravity. Fiber-reinforced composites with exceptionally highspecific strengths and moduli have been produced that utilize low-density fiber andmatrix materials. As noted in Figure 16.2, fiber-reinforced composites are subclassified by fiber length. For short fiber, the fibers are too short to produce a significant improvementin strength. 16.4 INFLUENCE OF FIBER LENGTH The mechanical characteristics of a fiber-reinforced composite depend not only onthe properties of the fiber, but also on the degree to which an applied load is trans-mitted to the fibers by the matrix phase. Important to the extent of this load trans-mittance is the magnitude of the interfacial bond between the fiber and matrixphases. Under an applied stress, this fiber–matrix bond ceases at the fiber ends,yielding a matrix deformation pattern as shown schematically in Figure 16.6; in otherwords, there is no load transmittance from the matrix at each fiber extremity.

fiber extremity. Some critical fiber length is necessary for effective strengthening and stiffening of the composite material. This critical length is dependent on the fiber diameterdand its ultimate (or tensile) strength and on the fiber–matrix bond strength (or the shear yield strength of the matrix, whichever is smaller) according to (16.3) For a number of glass and carbon fiber–matrix combinations, this critical length ison the order of 1 mm, which ranges between 20 and 150 times the fiber diameter. When a stress equal to is applied to a fiber having just this critical length, the stress–position profile shown in Figure 16.7 aresults; that is, the maximum fiber load is achieved only at the axial center of the fiber. As fiber length lincreases, the fiber reinforcement becomes more effective; this is demonstrated in Figure 16.7 b, a stress–axial position profile for when the applied stress is equal to the fiberstrength. Figure 16.7 cshows the stress–position profile for Fibers for which (normally ) are termed continuous; discontin- uous or short fibers have lengths shorter than this.

These are essentiallythe particulate composites as described above. To affect a significant improvementin strength of the composite, the fibers must be continuous.

be continuous. 16.5 INFLUENCE OF FIBER ORIENTATION AND CONCENTRATION The arrangement or orientation of the fibers relative to one another, the fiber con-centration, and the distribution all have a significant influence on the strength andother properties of fiber-reinforced composites. With respect to orientation, twoextremes are possible: (1) a parallel alignment of the longitudinal axis of the fibersin a single direction, and (2) a totally random alignment. Continuous fibers are nor-mally aligned (Figure 16.8 a), whereas discontinuous fibers may be aligned (Figure 16.8b), randomly oriented (Figure 16.8 c), or partially oriented. Better overall com- posite properties are realized when the fiber distribution is uniform. Continuous and Aligned Fiber Composites Tensile Stress–Strain Behavior—Longitudinal Loading Mechanical responses of this type of composite depend on several factors to include the stress–strain behaviors of fiber and matrix phases, the phase volumefractions, and, in addition, the direction in which the stress or load is applied.Furthermore, the properties of a composite having its fibers aligned are highlyanisotropic, that is, dependent on the direction in which they are measured.

To begin, assume the stress versus strain behaviors for fiber and matrix phases that are represented schematically in Figure 16.9 a; in this treatment we consider the fiber to be totally brittle and the matrix phase to be reasonably ductile.

A fiber-reinforced composite consisting of these fiber and matrix materials will exhibit the uniaxial stress–strain response illustrated in Figure 16.9 b; the fiber and matrix behaviors from Figure 16.9 aare included to provide perspective. In the ini- tial Stage I region, both fibers and matrix deform elastically; normally this portionof the curve is linear.

is linear. Typically, for a composite of this type, the matrix yields anddeforms plastically (at Figure 16.9 b) while the fibers continue to stretch elasti- cally, inasmuch as the tensile strength of the fibers is significantly higher than theyield strength of the matrix. This process constitutes Stage II as noted in the figure;this stage is ordinarily very nearly linear, but of diminished slope relative to StageI. Furthermore, in passing from Stage I to Stage II, the proportion of the appliedload that is borne by the fibers increases. The onset of composite failure begins as the fibers start to fracture, which corresponds to a strain of approximately as noted in Figure 16.9 b. Composite failure is not catastrophic for a couple of reasons. First, not all fibers fracture at thesame time, since there will always be considerable variations in the fracture strengthof brittle fiber materials (Section 12.8). In addition, even after fiber failure, the ma-trix is still intact inasmuch as (Figure 16.9a). Thus, these fractured fibers,which are shorter than the original ones, are still embedded within the intact ma-trix, and consequently are capable of sustaining a diminished load as the matrixcontinues to plastically deform. Elastic Behavior—Longitudinal Loading Let us now consider the elastic behavior of a continuous and oriented fibrous com-posite that is loaded in the direction of fiber alignment. First, it is assumed that thefiber–matrix interfacial bond is very good, such that deformation of both matrixand fibers is the same (an isostrain situation). Under these conditions, the total load sustained by the composite is equal to the sum of the loads carried by the ma-trix phase and the fiber phase or (16.4) From the definition of stress, Equation 6.1, and thus expressions for and in terms of their respective stresses ( and ) and cross-sectional areas ( and ) are possible.

are possible. Substitution of these into Equation 16.4 yields (16.5) and then, dividing through by the total cross-sectional area of the composite,we have (16.6) where and are the area fractions of the matrix and fiber phases, re-spectively. If the composite, matrix, and fiber phase lengths are all equal, isequivalent to the volume fraction of the matrix, and likewise for the fibers, Equation 16.6 now becomes (16.7) The previous assumption of an isostrain state means that (16.8) /H9280 c/H11005/H9280m/H11005/H9280fsc/H11005smVm/H11001sfVfVf/H11005Af/H11408Ac.Vm,Am/H11408AcAf/H11408Ac Am/H11408Acsc/H11005sm Am Ac/H11001sf Af AcAc,sc Ac/H11005smAm/H11001sf AfAf Ac, Am,sf sc, sm, Ff Fm,Fc, F/H11005sA;Fc/H11005Fm/H11001FfFf, FmFc/H9280f*6/H9280m*/H9280f*/H9280ym,/H9280m*7/H9280f*,/H9280m*; /H9280f*sm*, sf*588 •Chapter 16 / Composites1496T_c16_577-620 12/9/05 17:14 Page 588REVISED PAGESand when each term in Equation 16.7 is divided by its respective strain, (16.9) Furthermore, if composite, matrix, and fiber deformations are all elastic, then and the E’s being the moduli of elasticity for the respective phases.

Substitution into Equation 16.9 yields an expression for the modulus of elasticity of a continuous and aligned fibrous composite in the directionof alignment (or longitudinal direction), as (16.10a) or (16.10b) since the composite consists of only matrix and fiber phases; that is, Thus, is equal to the volume-fraction weighted average of the moduli of elasticity of the fiber and matrix phases. Other properties, including density, alsohave this dependence on volume fractions. Equation 16.10 ais the fiber analogue of Equation 16.1, the upper bound for particle-reinforced composites. It can also be shown, for longitudinal loading, that the ratio of the load carried by the fibers to that carried by the matrix is (16.11) The demonstration is left as a homework problem.

longitudinal direction. Under thesecircumstances, strength is normally taken as the maximum stress on the stress–straincurve, Figure 16.9b; often this point corresponds to fiber fracture, and marks theonset of composite failure.Table 16.1 lists typical longitudinal tensile strength valuesfor three common fibrous composites. Failure of this type of composite material isa relatively complex process, and several different failure modes are possible. Themode that operates for a specific composite will depend on fiber and matrix prop-erties, and the nature and strength of the fiber–matrix interfacial bond. If we assume that (Figure 16.9 a), which is the usual case, then fibers will fail before the matrix. Once the fibers have fractured, the majority of the loadthat was borne by the fibers is now transferred to the matrix. This being the case,it is possible to adapt the expression for the stress on this type of composite, Equa-tion 16.7, into the following expression for the longitudinal strength of the com-posite, (16.17) Here is the stress in the matrix at fiber failure (as illustrated in Figure 16.9 a) and, as previously, is the fiber tensile strength. Transverse Tensile Strength The strengths of continuous and unidirectional fibrous composites are highlyanisotropic, and such composites are normally designed to be loaded along the high-strength, longitudinal direction. However, during in-service applications transversetensile loads may also be present. Under these circumstances, premature failure mayresult inasmuch as transverse strength is usually extremely low—it sometimes liesbelow the tensile strength of the matrix. Thus, in actual fact, the reinforcing effectof the fibers is a negative one. Typical transverse tensile strengths for three unidi-rectional composites are contained in Table 16.1. Whereas longitudinal strength is dominated by fiber strength, a variety of fac- tors will have a significant influence on the transverse strength; these factors in-clude properties of both the fiber and matrix, the fiber–matrix bond strength, andthe presence of voids.

of voids. Measures that have been employed to improve the trans-verse strength of these composites usually involve modifying properties of thematrix.s f*s¿ms*cl/H11005s¿m11/H11002Vf2/H11001s*fVfs*cl:/H9280f*6/H9280m*592 •Chapter 16 / Composites Table 16.1 Typical Longitudinal and Transverse Tensile Strengthsfor Three Unidirectional Fiber-Reinforced Composites.

Companion Site).] Discontinuous and Aligned Fiber Composites Even though reinforcement efficiency is lower for discontinuous than for continu-ous fibers, discontinuous and aligned fiber composites (Figure 16.8 b) are becoming increasingly more important in the commercial market. Chopped glass fibers areused most extensively; however, carbon and aramid discontinuous fibers are alsoemployed.These short fiber composites can be produced having moduli of elasticityand tensile strengths that approach 90% and 50%, respectively, of their continuousfiber counterparts. For a discontinuous and aligned fiber composite having a uniform distribu- tion of fibers and in which the longitudinal strength is given by the relationship (16.18) where and represent, respectively, the fracture strength of the fiber and thestress in the matrix when the composite fails (Figure 16.9 a).

Discontinuous and Randomly Oriented Fiber Composites Normally, when the fiber orientation is random, short and discontinuous fibers areused; reinforcement of this type is schematically demonstrated in Figure 16.8 c. Under these circumstances, a “rule-of-mixtures” expression for the elastic modulussimilar to Equation 16.10 amay be utilized, as follows: (16.20) E cd/H11005KEfVf/H11001EmVmtcs*cd¿/H11005ltc d Vf/H11001s¿m11/H11002Vf2(s*cd¿)(l6lc),s¿m sf*s*cd/H11005s*fVf a1/H11002lc 2lb/H11001s¿m 11/H11002Vf2(s*cd) l7lc,16.5 Influence of Fiber Orientation and Concentration •593 For a discontinuous (l/H11022 lc) and aligned fiber-reinforcedcomposite,longitudinal strengthin tension For a discontinuous (l/H11021 l c) and aligned fiber-reinforcedcomposite,longitudinal strengthin tension For a discontinuous and randomlyoriented fiber-reinforcedcomposite, modulusof elasticity1496T_c16_577-620 12/13/05 9:33 Page 593REVISED PAGESIn this expression, Kis a fiber efficiency parameter that depends on and the ratio.

the ratio. Of course, its magnitude will be less than unity, usually in the range 0.1 to 0.6. Thus, for random fiber reinforcement (as with oriented), the modulus in- creases in some proportion of the volume fraction of fiber. Table 16.2, which givessome of the mechanical properties of unreinforced and reinforced polycarbonatesfor discontinuous and randomly oriented glass fibers, provides an idea of the mag-nitude of the reinforcement that is possible. By way of summary, then, aligned fibrous composites are inherently anisotropic, in that the maximum strength and reinforcement are achieved along the alignment(longitudinal) direction. In the transverse direction, fiber reinforcement is virtuallynonexistent: fracture usually occurs at relatively low tensile stresses. For other stressorientations, composite strength lies between these extremes. The efficiency of fiberreinforcement for several situations is presented in Table 16.3; this efficiency is takento be unity for an oriented fiber composite in the alignment direction, and zero per-pendicular to it. When multidirectional stresses are imposed within a single plane, aligned lay- ers that are fastened together one on top of another at different orientations arefrequently utilized. These are termed laminar composites, which are discussed in Section 16.14.E f/H11408EmVf594 •Chapter 16 / Composites Table 16.2 Properties of Unreinforced and Reinforced Polycarbonates with Randomly Oriented Glass Fibers Fiber Reinforcement (vol%) Property Unreinforced 20 30 40 Specific gravity 1.19–1.22 1.35 1.43 1.52 Tensile strength 59–62 110 131 159 [MPa (ksi)] (8.5–9.0) (16) (19) (23) Modulus of elasticity 2.24–2.345 5.93 8.62 11.6 [GPa (106psi)] (0.325–0.340) (0.86) (1.25) (1.68) Elongation (%) 90–115 4–6 3–5 3–5 Impact strength, 12–16 2.0 2.0 2.5 notched Izod (lb f/in.)

Companion Site).] 16.6 THE FIBER PHASE An important characteristic of most materials, especially brittle ones, is that a small-diameter fiber is much stronger than the bulk material.As discussed in Section 12.8,the probability of the presence of a critical surface flaw that can lead to fracturediminishes with decreasing specimen volume, and this feature is used to advantagein the fiber-reinforced composites. Also, the materials used for reinforcing fibershave high tensile strengths. On the basis of diameter and character, fibers are grouped into three dif- ferent classifications: whiskers, fibers, and wires. Whiskers are very thin single crystals that have extremely large length-to-diameter ratios. As a consequenceof their small size, they have a high degree of crystalline perfection and are vir-tually flaw free, which accounts for their exceptionally high strengths; they areamong the strongest known materials. In spite of these high strengths, whiskersare not utilized extensively as a reinforcement medium because they are ex-tremely expensive. Moreover, it is difficult and often impractical to incorporatewhiskers into a matrix. Whisker materials include graphite, silicon carbide, sili-con nitride, and aluminum oxide; some mechanical characteristics of thesematerials are given in Table 16.4. Materials that are classified as fibers are either polycrystalline or amorphous and have small diameters; fibrous materials are generally either polymers or ce-ramics (e.g., the polymer aramids, glass, carbon, boron, aluminum oxide, and siliconcarbide). Table 16.4 also presents some data on a few materials that are used infiber form. Fine wires have relatively large diameters; typical materials include steel, molybdenum, and tungsten. Wires are utilized as a radial steel reinforcement inautomobile tires, in filament-wound rocket casings, and in wire-wound high-pressurehoses.16.6 The Fiber Phase •595 whisker fiber1496T_c16_577-620 12/13/05 9:33 Page 595REVISED PAGES16.7 THE MATRIX PHASE The matrix phase of fibrous composites may be a metal, polymer, or ceramic.

or ceramic. In general, metals and polymers are used as matrix materials because some ductility is desirable; for ceramic-matrix composites (Section 16.10), the reinforcing compo-nent is added to improve fracture toughness.The discussion of this section will focuson polymer and metal matrices. For fiber-reinforced composites, the matrix phase serves several functions. First, it binds the fibers together and acts as the medium by which an externally appliedstress is transmitted and distributed to the fibers; only a very small proportion ofan applied load is sustained by the matrix phase. Furthermore, the matrix materialshould be ductile. In addition, the elastic modulus of the fiber should be much higherthan that of the matrix. The second function of the matrix is to protect the indi-vidual fibers from surface damage as a result of mechanical abrasion or chemical596 •Chapter 16 / Composites Table 16.4 Characteristics of Several Fiber-Reinforcement Materials Tensile Specific Modulus Specific Strength Strength of Elasticity Modulus Material Specific Gravity [GPa (106psi)] (GPa)[ GPa (106psi)] (GPa) Whiskers Graphite 2.2 20 9.1 700 318 (3) (100) Silicon nitride 3.2 5–7 1.56–2.2 350–380 109–118 (0.75–1.0) (50–55) Aluminum oxide 4.0 10–20 2.5–5.0 700–1500 175–375 (1–3) (100–220) Silicon carbide 3.2 20 6.25 480 150 (3) (70) Fibers Aluminum oxide 3.95 1.38 0.35 379 96 (0.2) (55) Aramid (Kevlar 49™) 1.44 3.6–4.1 2.5–2.85 131 91 (0.525–0.600) (19) Carbona1.78–2.15 1.5–4.8 0.70–2.70 228–724 106–407 (0.22–0.70) (32–100) E-glass 2.58 3.45 1.34 72.5 28.1 (0.5) (10.5) Boron 2.57 3.6 1.40 400 156 (0.52) (60) Silicon carbide 3.0 3.9 1.30 400 133 (0.57) (60) UHMWPE (Spectra 900™) 0.97 2.6 2.68 117 121 (0.38) (17) Metallic Wires High-strength steel 7.9 2.39 0.30 210 26.6 (0.35) (30) Molybdenum 10.2 2.2 0.22 324 31.8 (0.32) (47) Tungsten 19.3 2.89 0.15 407 21.1 (0.42) (59) The term “carbon” instead of “graphite” is used to denote these fibers, since they are composed of crystalline graphite regions, and also of noncrystalline material and areas of crystal misalignment.a matrix phase1496T_c16_577-620 12/31/05 14:08 Page 5962nd REVISE PAGESreactions with the environment.

the environment. Such interactions may introduce surface flaws ca- pable of forming cracks, which may lead to failure at low tensile stress levels. Finally,the matrix separates the fibers and, by virtue of its relative softness and plasticity,prevents the propagation of brittle cracks from fiber to fiber, which could result incatastrophic failure; in other words, the matrix phase serves as a barrier to crackpropagation. Even though some of the individual fibers fail, total composite frac-ture will not occur until large numbers of adjacent fibers, once having failed, forma cluster of critical size. It is essential that adhesive bonding forces between fiber and matrix be high to minimize fiber pull-out. In fact, bonding strength is an important considerationin the choice of the matrix–fiber combination. The ultimate strength of the com-posite depends to a large degree on the magnitude of this bond; adequate bondingis essential to maximize the stress transmittance from the weak matrix to the strongfibers. 16.8 POLYMER-MATRIX COMPOSITES Polymer-matrix composites (PMCs) consist of a polymer resin1as the matrix, with fibers as the reinforcement medium. These materials are used in the greatestdiversity of composite applications, as well as in the largest quantities, in light oftheir room-temperature properties, ease of fabrication, and cost. In this section thevarious classifications of PMCs are discussed according to reinforcement type (i.e.,glass, carbon, and aramid), along with their applications and the various polymerresins that are employed. Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) Composites Fiberglass is simply a composite consisting of glass fibers, either continuous or dis-continuous, contained within a polymer matrix; this type of composite is producedin the largest quantities. The composition of the glass that is most commonly drawninto fibers (sometimes referred to as E-glass) is contained in Table 13.1; fiberdiameters normally range between 3 and 20 m. Glass is popular as a fiber rein-forcement material for several reasons: 1.It is easily drawn into high-strength fibers from the molten state.

molten state. 2.It is readily available and may be fabricated into a glass-reinforced plasticeconomically using a wide variety of composite-manufacturing techniques. 3.As a fiber it is relatively strong, and when embedded in a plastic matrix, itproduces a composite having a very high specific strength. 4.When coupled with the various plastics, it possesses a chemical inertness thatrenders the composite useful in a variety of corrosive environments. The surface characteristics of glass fibers are extremely important because even minute surface flaws can deleteriously affect the tensile properties, as dis- cussed in Section 12.8. Surface flaws are easily introduced by rubbing or abrad-ing the surface with another hard material. Also, glass surfaces that have beenexposed to the normal atmosphere for even short time periods generally have aweakened surface layer that interferes with bonding to the matrix. Newly drawnfibers are normally coated during drawing with a “size,” a thin layer of a substancem16.8 Polymer-Matrix Composites •597 polymer-matrix composite 1The term “resin” is used in this context to denote a high-molecular-weight reinforcing plastic.1496T_c16_577-620 12/9/05 17:14 Page 597REVISED PAGESthat protects the fiber surface from damage and undesirable environmental inter- actions. This size is ordinarily removed prior to composite fabrication and replacedwith a “coupling agent” or finish that produces a chemical bond between the fiberand matrix. There are several limitations to this group of materials. In spite of having high strengths, they are not very stiff and do not display the rigidity that is necessaryfor some applications (e.g., as structural members for airplanes and bridges). Mostfiberglass materials are limited to service temperatures below at higher temperatures, most polymers begin to flow or to deteriorate. Service tem-peratures may be extended to approximately by using high-purity fused silica for the fibers and high-temperature polymers such as the polyimideresins.

the polyimideresins. Many fiberglass applications are familiar: automotive and marine bodies, plastic pipes, storage containers, and industrial floorings. The transportation industries areutilizing increasing amounts of glass fiber-reinforced plastics in an effort to decreasevehicle weight and boost fuel efficiencies. A host of new applications are being usedor currently investigated by the automotive industry. Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) Composites Carbon is a high-performance fiber material that is the most commonly used rein-forcement in advanced (i.e., nonfiberglass) polymer-matrix composites. The reasonsfor this are as follows: 1.Carbon fibers have the highest specific modulus and specific strength of allreinforcing fiber materials. 2.They retain their high tensile modulus and high strength at elevated tempera-tures; high-temperature oxidation, however, may be a problem. 3.At room temperature, carbon fibers are not affected by moisture or a widevariety of solvents, acids, and bases. 4.These fibers exhibit a diversity of physical and mechanical characteristics,allowing composites incorporating these fibers to have specific engineeredproperties. 5.Fiber and composite manufacturing processes have been developed that arerelatively inexpensive and cost effective. Use of the term “carbon fiber” may seem perplexing since carbon is an ele- ment, and, as noted in Section 12.4, the stable form of crystalline carbon at ambi- ent conditions is graphite, having the structure represented in Figure 12.17. Carbonfibers are not totally crystalline, but are composed of both graphitic and noncrys-talline regions; these areas of noncrystallinity are devoid of the three-dimensionalordered arrangement of hexagonal carbon networks that is characteristic of graphite(Figure 12.17). Manufacturing techniques for producing carbon fibers are relatively complex and will not be discussed. However, three different organic precursor materials areused: rayon, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and pitch.

and pitch. Processing technique will vary fromprecursor to precursor, as will also the resultant fiber characteristics. One classification scheme for carbon fibers is by tensile modulus; on this basis the four classes are standard, intermediate, high, and ultrahigh moduli. Furthermore,fiber diameters normally range between 4 and 10 m; both continuous and choppedforms are available. In addition, carbon fibers are normally coated with a protectiveepoxy size that also improves adhesion with the polymer matrix.m300/H11034C (575/H11034F)200/H11034C (400/H11034F);598 •Chapter 16 / Composites 1496T_c16_577-620 12/9/05 17:14 Page 598REVISED PAGESFigure 16.10 Schematic representation of repeat unit and chain structures for aramid(Kevlar) fibers.

Aramid Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Composites Aramid fibers are high-strength, high-modulus materials that were introduced inthe early 1970s. They are especially desirable for their outstanding strength-to-weight ratios, which are superior to metals. Chemically, this group of materials isknown as poly(paraphenylene terephthalamide).

poly(paraphenylene terephthalamide). There are a number of aramidmaterials; trade names for two of the most common are Kevlar™ and Nomex™.For the former, there are several grades (viz. Kevlar 29, 49, and 149) that have dif-ferent mechanical behaviors. During synthesis, the rigid molecules are aligned inthe direction of the fiber axis, as liquid crystal domains (Section 15.19); the repeatunit and the mode of chain alignment are represented in Figure 16.10. Mechani-cally, these fibers have longitudinal tensile strengths and tensile moduli (Table 16.4)that are higher than other polymeric fiber materials; however, they are relativelyweak in compression. In addition, this material is known for its toughness, impactresistance, and resistance to creep and fatigue failure. Even though the aramids arethermoplastics, they are, nevertheless, resistant to combustion and stable to rela-tively high temperatures; the temperature range over which they retain their highmechanical properties is between and Chemically, they are susceptible to degradation by strong acids and bases, but they are rela-tively inert in other solvents and chemicals. The aramid fibers are most often used in composites having polymer matrices; common matrix materials are the epoxies and polyesters. Since the fibers are relativelyflexible and somewhat ductile, they may be processed by most common textile oper-ations.Typical applications of these aramid composites are in ballistic products (bullet-proof vests and armor), sporting goods, tires, ropes, missile cases, pressure vessels, andas a replacement for asbestos in automotive brake and clutch linings, and gaskets. The properties of continuous and aligned glass-, carbon-, and aramid-fiber rein- forced epoxy composites are included in Table 16.5. Thus, a comparison of the me-chanical characteristics of these three materials may be made in both longitudinal andtransverse directions.200/H11034C (/H11002330 and 390/H11034F).

Other fiber materials that are used to much lesser de-grees are boron, silicon carbide, and aluminum oxide; tensile moduli, tensilestrengths, specific strengths, and specific moduli of these materials in fiber form arecontained in Table 16.4. Boron fiber-reinforced polymer composites have been usedin military aircraft components, helicopter rotor blades, and some sporting goods.Silicon carbide and aluminum oxide fibers are utilized in tennis rackets, circuitboards, military armor, and rocket nose cones. Polymer Matrix Materials The roles assumed by the polymer matrix are outlined in Section 16.7. In addi-tion, the matrix often determines the maximum service temperature, since itnormally softens, melts, or degrades at a much lower temperature than the fiberreinforcement. The most widely utilized and least expensive polymer resins are the polyesters and vinyl esters; 2these matrix materials are used primarily for glass fiber-reinforced composites.A large number of resin formulations provide a wide range of propertiesfor these polymers. The epoxies are more expensive and, in addition to commercialapplications, are also utilized extensively in PMCs for aerospace applications; theyhave better mechanical properties and resistance to moisture than the polyestersand vinyl resins. For high-temperature applications, polyimide resins are employed;their continuous-use, upper-temperature limit is approximately Fi- nally, high-temperature thermoplastic resins offer the potential to be used in futureaerospace applications; such materials include polyetheretherketone (PEEK),poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS), and polyetherimide (PEI).230/H11034C (450/H11034F).600 •Chapter 16 / Composites Table 16.5 Properties of Continuous and Aligned Glass-, Carbon-, andAramid-Fiber Reinforced Epoxy-Matrix Composites in Longitudinaland Transverse Directions.

The mechanicalcharacteristic of prime importance is bending stiffness in terms of the longitu-dinal modulus of elasticity; strength and fatigue resistance are not significantparameters for this application when filament composites are utilized. Stiffnessis to be specified as maximum allowable deflection in bending; when subjectedto three-point bending as in Figure 12.32 (i.e., support points at both tube ex-tremities and load application at the longitudinal midpoint), a load of 1000 N(225 lb f) is to produce an elastic deflection of no more than 0.35 mm (0.014 in.)

(0.014 in.) at the midpoint position. Continuous fibers that are oriented parallel to the tube axis will be used; possible fiber materials are glass, and carbon in standard-, intermediate-, and high-modulus grades. The matrix material is to be an epoxy resin, and the maximumallowable fiber volume fraction is 0.60. This design problem calls for us to do the following: (a)Decide which of the four fiber materials, when embedded in the epoxy matrix, meet the stipulated criteria.

These materials may be utilized at higher service temperatures than their base metal counterparts; furthermore, the reinforcement may improve specificmetal-matrix compositeThus, fiber and matrix volumes result from products of this value and the and values cited in Table 16.7. These volume values are presented in Table 16.8, which are then converted into masses using densities (Table 16.6), and finallyinto material costs, from the per unit mass cost (also given in Table 16.6). As may be noted in Table 16.8, the material of choice (i.e., the least expen- sive) is the standard-modulus carbon-fiber composite; the relatively low cost perunit mass of this fiber material offsets its relatively low modulus of elasticity andrequired high volume fraction.V mVf1496T_c16_577-620 12/13/05 9:33 Page 603REVISED PAGESstiffness, specific strength, abrasion resistance, creep resistance, thermal conductiv- ity, and dimensional stability. Some of the advantages of these materials over thepolymer-matrix composites include higher operating temperatures, nonflammability,and greater resistance to degradation by organic fluids. Metal-matrix compositesare much more expensive than PMCs, and, therefore, their (MMC) use is somewhatrestricted. The superalloys, as well as alloys of aluminum, magnesium, titanium, and cop- per, are employed as matrix materials. The reinforcement may be in the form ofparticulates, both continuous and discontinuous fibers, and whiskers; concentrationsnormally range between 10 and 60 vol%. Continuous fiber materials include car-bon, silicon carbide, boron, aluminum oxide, and the refractory metals. On the otherhand, discontinuous reinforcements consist primarily of silicon carbide whiskers,chopped fibers of aluminum oxide and carbon, and particulates of silicon carbideand aluminum oxide.

aluminum oxide. In a sense, the cermets (Section 16.2) fall within this MMCscheme. In Table 16.9 are presented the properties of several common metal-matrix,continuous and aligned fiber-reinforced composites. Some matrix–reinforcement combinations are highly reactive at elevated tem- peratures. Consequently, composite degradation may be caused by high-temperatureprocessing or by subjecting the MMC to elevated temperatures during service. Thisproblem is commonly resolved either by applying a protective surface coating tothe reinforcement or by modifying the matrix alloy composition. Normally the processing of MMCs involves at least two steps: consolidation or synthesis (i.e., introduction of reinforcement into the matrix), followed by a shapingoperation. A host of consolidation techniques are available, some of which are rela-tively sophisticated; discontinuous fiber MMCs are amenable to shaping by standardmetal-forming operations (e.g., forging, extrusion, rolling). Automobile manufacturers have recently begun to use MMCs in their prod- ucts. For example, some engine components have been introduced consisting of analuminum-alloy matrix that is reinforced with aluminum oxide and carbon fibers;this MMC is light in weight and resists wear and thermal distortion. Metal-matrixcomposites are also employed in driveshafts (that have higher rotational speeds andreduced vibrational noise levels), extruded stabilizer bars, and forged suspensionand transmission components. The aerospace industry also uses MMCs. Structural applications include advanced aluminum alloy metal-matrix composites; boron fibers are used as the reinforce-ment for the Space Shuttle Orbiter, and continuous graphite fibers for the HubbleTelescope.604 •Chapter 16 / Composites Table 16.9 Properties of Several Metal-Matrix Composites Reinforced with Continuous and Aligned Fibers Fiber Content Density Longitudinal Tensile Longitudinal Tensile Fiber Matrix (vol%) (g/cm3) Modulus (GPa) Strength (MPa) Carbon 6061 Al 41 2.44 320 620 Boron 6061 Al 48 — 207 1515 SiC 6061 Al 50 2.93 230 1480 Alumina 380.0 Al 24 — 120 340 Carbon AZ31 Mg 38 1.83 300 510 Borsic Ti 45 3.68 220 1270 Source: Adapted from J.

as tungsten. Excellent high-temperature oxidation resistance andimpact strength are also maintained. Designs incorporating these composites per-mit higher operating temperatures and better efficiencies for turbine engines. 16.10 CERAMIC-MATRIX COMPOSITES As discussed in Chapters 12 and 13, ceramic materials are inherently resilient tooxidation and deterioration at elevated temperatures; were it not for their disposi-tion to brittle fracture, some of these materials would be ideal candidates for usein high-temperature and severe-stress applications, specifically for components inautomobile and aircraft gas turbine engines. Fracture toughness values for ceramicmaterials are low and typically lie between 1 and 5 MPa (0.9 and 4.5 ksi ),Table 8.1 and Table B.5, Appendix B. By way of contrast, values for most met-als are much higher (15 to greater than 150 MPa [14 to 140 ksi ]) The fracture toughnesses of ceramics have been improved significantly by the development of a new generation of ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs)— particulates, fibers, or whiskers of one ceramic material that have been embeddedinto a matrix of another ceramic. Ceramic-matrix composite materials have extendedfracture toughnesses to between about 6 and 20 MPa (5.5 and 18 ksi ). In essence, this improvement in the fracture properties results from interactions between advancing cracks and dispersed phase particles. Crack initiation normallyoccurs with the matrix phase, whereas crack propagation is impeded or hinderedby the particles, fibers, or whiskers. Several techniques are utilized to retard crackpropagation, which are discussed as follows. One particularly interesting and promising toughening technique employs a phase transformation to arrest the propagation of cracks and is aptly termed trans- formation toughening. Small particles of partially stabilized zirconia (Section 12.7) are dispersed within the matrix material, often Al 2O3or ZrO 2itself.

ZrO 2itself. Typically, CaO, MgO, Y 2O3, and CeO are used as stabilizers. Partial stabilization allows retention of the metastable tetragonal phase at ambient conditions rather than the stablemonoclinic phase; these two phases are noted on the ZrO 2–ZrCaO 3phase diagram, Figure 12.26. The stress field in front of a propagating crack causes these metastablyretained tetragonal particles to undergo transformation to the stable monoclinicphase. Accompanying this transformation is a slight particle volume increase, andthe net result is that compressive stresses are established on the crack surfaces nearthe crack tip that tend to pinch the crack shut, thereby arresting its growth. Thisprocess is demonstrated schematically in Figure 16.12. Other recently developed toughening techniques involve the utilization of ce- ramic whiskers, often SiC or Si 3N4. These whiskers may inhibit crack propagation by (1) deflecting crack tips, (2) forming bridges across crack faces, (3) absorbing en-ergy during pull-out as the whiskers debond from the matrix, and/or (4) causing aredistribution of stresses in regions adjacent to the crack tips. In general, increasing fiber content improves strength and fracture toughness; this is demonstrated in Table 16.10 for SiC whisker-reinforced alumina. Further-more, there is a considerable reduction in the scatter of fracture strengths forwhisker-reinforced ceramics relative to their unreinforced counterparts. In addition,these CMCs exhibit improved high-temperature creep behavior and resistance tothermal shock (i.e., failure resulting from sudden changes in temperature). Ceramic-matrix composites may be fabricated using hot pressing, hot isostatic pressing, and liquid phase sintering techniques. Relative to applications, SiC1in . 1m1in.

These materials arerelatively new and expensive and, therefore, are not currently being utilized exten-sively. Their desirable properties include high-tensile moduli and tensile strengthsthat are retained to temperatures in excess of resistance to creep, and relatively large fracture toughness values. Furthermore, carbon–carbon com-posites have low coefficients of thermal expansion and relatively high thermal con-ductivities; these characteristics, coupled with high strengths, give rise to a relativelylow susceptibility to thermal shock. Their major drawback is a propensity to high-temperature oxidation. The carbon–carbon composites are employed in rocket motors, as friction ma- terials in aircraft and high-performance automobiles, for hot-pressing molds, in com-ponents for advanced turbine engines, and as ablative shields for re-entry vehicles.2000/H11034C (3630/H11034F),606 •Chapter 16 / Composites Table 16.10 Room Temperature Fracture Strengths andFracture Toughnesses for Various SiC Whisker Contents in Al 2O3 Whisker Fracture Fracture Toughness Content (vol%) Strength (MPa)( MPa ) 0 — 4.5 10 455/H11006 55 7.1 20 655/H11006 135 7.5–9.0 40 850/H11006 130 6.0 Source: Adapted from Engineered Materials Handbook, Vol.

Preliminary proce- dures are similar to those used for carbon-fiber, polymer-matrix composites. Thatis, the continuous carbon fibers are laid down having the desired two- or three-dimensional pattern; these fibers are then impregnated with a liquid polymerresin, often a phenolic; the workpiece is next formed into the final shape, andthe resin is allowed to cure. At this time the matrix resin is “pyrolyzed,” that is,converted into carbon by heating in an inert atmosphere; during pyrolysis, mo-lecular components consisting of oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen are driven off,leaving behind large carbon chain molecules. Subsequent heat treatments athigher temperatures will cause this carbon matrix to densify and increase instrength. The resulting composite, then, consists of the original carbon fibers thatremained essentially unaltered, which are contained in this pyrolyzed carbonmatrix. 16.12 HYBRID COMPOSITES A relatively new fiber-reinforced composite is the hybrid, which is obtained by using two or more different kinds of fibers in a single matrix; hybrids have a better all-around combination of properties than composites containing only a single fibertype.

single fibertype. A variety of fiber combinations and matrix materials are used, but in the mostcommon system, both carbon and glass fibers are incorporated into a polymericresin. The carbon fibers are strong and relatively stiff and provide a low-density re-inforcement; however, they are expensive. Glass fibers are inexpensive and lack thestiffness of carbon. The glass–carbon hybrid is stronger and tougher, has a higherimpact resistance, and may be produced at a lower cost than either of the compa-rable all-carbon or all-glass reinforced plastics. There are a number of ways in which the two different fibers may be combined, which will ultimately affect the overall properties. For example, the fibers may allbe aligned and intimately mixed with one another; or laminations may be con-structed consisting of layers, each of which consists of a single fiber type, alternatingone with another. In virtually all hybrids the properties are anisotropic. When hybrid composites are stressed in tension, failure is usually noncata- strophic (i.e., does not occur suddenly). The carbon fibers are the first to fail, atwhich time the load is transferred to the glass fibers. Upon failure of the glass fibers,the matrix phase must sustain the applied load. Eventual composite failure concurswith that of the matrix phase. Principal applications for hybrid composites are lightweight land, water, and air transport structural components, sporting goods, and lightweight orthopediccomponents. 16.13 PROCESSING OF FIBER-REINFORCED COMPOSITES To fabricate continuous fiber-reinforced plastics that meet design specifications, thefibers should be uniformly distributed within the plastic matrix and, in most in-stances, all oriented in virtually the same direction. In this section several techniques(pultrusion, filament winding, and prepreg production processes) by which usefulproducts of these materials are manufactured will be discussed. Pultrusion Pultrusion is used for the manufacture of components having continuous lengths and a constant cross-sectional shape (i.e., rods, tubes, beams, etc.

beams, etc. ).With this technique,16.13 Processing of Fiber-Reinforced Composites •607 hybrid composite1496T_c16_577-620 12/9/05 17:14 Page 607REVISED PAGESillustrated schematically in Figure 16.13, continuous fiber rovings, or tows,3are first impregnated with a thermosetting resin; these are then pulled through a steel die that preforms to the desired shape and also establishes the resin/fiber ratio. Thestock then passes through a curing die that is precision machined so as to impartthe final shape; this die is also heated to initiate curing of the resin matrix. A pullingdevice draws the stock through the dies and also determines the production speed.Tubes and hollow sections are made possible by using center mandrels or insertedhollow cores. Principal reinforcements are glass, carbon, and aramid fibers, normallyadded in concentrations between 40 and 70 vol%. Commonly used matrix materi-als include polyesters, vinyl esters, and epoxy resins. Pultrusion is a continuous process that is easily automated; production rates are relatively high, making it very cost effective. Furthermore, a wide variety of shapesare possible, and there is really no practical limit to the length of stock that may bemanufactured. Prepreg Production Processes Prepreg is the composite industry’s term for continuous fiber reinforcement preim- pregnated with a polymer resin that is only partially cured.This material is deliveredin tape form to the manufacturer, who then directly molds and fully cures the prod-uct without having to add any resin. It is probably the composite material form mostwidely used for structural applications. The prepregging process, represented schematically for thermoset polymers in Figure 16.14, begins by collimating a series of spool-wound continuous fiber tows.These tows are then sandwiched and pressed between sheets of release and carrierpaper using heated rollers, a process termed “calendering.” The release paper sheethas been coated with a thin film of heated resin solution of relatively low viscosityso as to provide for its thorough impregnation of the fibers.A “doctor blade” spreadsthe resin into a film of uniform thickness and width.

and width. The final prepreg product—thethin tape consisting of continuous and aligned fibers embedded in a partially curedresin—is prepared for packaging by winding onto a cardboard core.As shown in Fig-ure 16.14, the release paper sheet is removed as the impregnated tape is spooled.Typical tape thicknesses range between 0.08 and 0.25 mm tape widths range between 25 and 1525 mm (1 and 60 in. ), whereas resin contentusually lies between about 35 and 45 vol%.

Also, the time in use at room tem- perature (or “out-time”) must be minimized. If properly handled, thermoset prepregshave a lifetime of at least six months and usually longer. Both thermoplastic and thermosetting resins are utilized; carbon, glass, and aramid fibers are the common reinforcements. Actual fabrication begins with the “lay-up”—laying of the prepreg tape onto a tooled surface. Normally a number of plies are laid up (after removal from the car-rier backing paper) to provide the desired thickness. The lay-up arrangement maybe unidirectional, but more often the fiber orientation is alternated to produce across-ply or angle-ply laminate.

angle-ply laminate. Final curing is accomplished by the simultaneousapplication of heat and pressure. The lay-up procedure may be carried out entirely by hand (hand lay-up), wherein the operator both cuts the lengths of tape and then positions them in the desiredorientation on the tooled surface. Alternately, tape patterns may be machine cut,then hand laid. Fabrication costs can be further reduced by automation of prepreglay-up and other manufacturing procedures (e.g., filament winding, as discussed be-low), which virtually eliminates the need for hand labor. These automated methodsare essential for many applications of composite materials to be cost effective. Filament Winding Filament winding is a process by which continuous reinforcing fibers are accurately positioned in a predetermined pattern to form a hollow (usually cylindrical) shape.The fibers, either as individual strands or as tows, are first fed through a resin bathand then are continuously wound onto a mandrel, usually using automated wind-ing equipment (Figure 16.15). After the appropriate number of layers have beenapplied, curing is carried out either in an oven or at room temperature, after whichthe mandrel is removed.As an alternative, narrow and thin prepregs (i.e., tow pregs)10 mm or less in width may be filament wound. Various winding patterns are possible (i.e., circumferential, helical, and polar) to give the desired mechanical characteristics. Filament-wound parts have very highstrength-to-weight ratios. Also, a high degree of control over winding uniformity0/H11034C (32/H11034F)16.13 Processing of Fiber-Reinforced Composites •609 Doctor bladeHopper containing heated resin Release paper Waste release paper Heated calender rollsSpooled fiber Carrier paperSpooled prepregFigure 16.14 Schematic diagram illustrating the production of prepreg tape using a thermoset polymer.1496T_c16_577-620 12/13/05 9:33 Page 609REVISED PAGESand orientation is afforded with this technique.

this technique. Furthermore, when automated, the process is most economically attractive. Common filament-wound structures includerocket motor casings, storage tanks and pipes, and pressure vessels. Manufacturing techniques are now being used to produce a wide variety of structural shapes that are not necessarily limited to surfaces of revolution (e.g.,I-beams). This technology is advancing very rapidly because it is very cost effective. Structural Composites A structural composite is normally composed of both homogeneous and compos- ite materials, the properties of which depend not only on the properties of theconstituent materials but also on the geometrical design of the various structuralelements. Laminar composites and sandwich panels are two of the most commonstructural composites; only a relatively superficial examination is offered here forthem. 16.14 LAMINAR COMPOSITES A laminar composite is composed of two-dimensional sheets or panels that have a preferred high-strength direction such as is found in wood and continuous andaligned fiber-reinforced plastics. The layers are stacked and subsequently cementedtogether such that the orientation of the high-strength direction varies with eachsuccessive layer (Figure 16.16). For example, adjacent wood sheets in plywood arealigned with the grain direction at right angles to each other. Laminations may alsobe constructed using fabric material such as cotton, paper, or woven glass fibers em-bedded in a plastic matrix. Thus a laminar composite has relatively high strength ina number of directions in the two-dimensional plane; however, the strength in anygiven direction is, of course, lower than it would be if all the fibers were orientedin that direction. One example of a relatively complex laminated structure is themodern ski (see the chapter-opening illustration for this chapter).610 •Chapter 16 / Composites Helical winding Circumferential winding Polar windingFigure 16.15 Schematic representations of helical, circumferential, and polar filament winding techniques.

A sandwich panel consists of two outer sheets, or faces, that are separated by and ad-hesively bonded to a thicker core (Figure 16.17). The outer sheets are made of arelatively stiff and strong material, typically aluminum alloys, fiber-reinforced plas-tics, titanium, steel, or plywood; they impart high stiffness and strength to the struc-ture, and must be thick enough to withstand tensile and compressive stresses thatresult from loading.The core material is lightweight, and normally has a low modulusof elasticity. Core materials typically fall within three categories: rigid polymericfoams (i.e., phenolics, epoxy, polyurethanes), wood (i.e., balsa wood), and honeycombs(see below). Structurally, the core serves several functions. First of all, it provides continuous support for the faces. In addition, it must have sufficient shear strength to withstandtransverse shear stresses, and also be thick enough to provide high shear stiffness(to resist buckling of the panel). (It should be noted that tensile and compressivestresses on the core are much lower than on the faces.) Another popular core consists of a “honeycomb” structure—thin foils that have been formed into interlocking hexagonal cells, with axes oriented perpendicular to16.15 Sandwich Panels •611 Figure 16.16 The stacking of successive oriented, fiber-reinforced layers for a laminar composite.

The honeycomb material is normally either an aluminum alloy or aramidpolymer. Strength and stiffness of honeycomb structures depend on cell size, cellwall thickness, and the material from which the honeycomb is made. Sandwich panels are used in a wide variety of applications including roofs, floors, and walls of buildings; and, in aerospace and aircraft (i.e., for wings, fuselage, andtailplane skins).612 •Chapter 16 / Composites Face sheet Honeycomb Adhesive Face sheetFabricated sandwich panel Figure 16.18 Schematic diagram showing the construction of a honeycomb core sandwich panel.

Nanocomposites in Tennis BallsMATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE Nanocomposites—composites that consist of nanosized particles embedded in some type of matrix—are a group of promising new materi-als, that will undoubtedly become infused withsome of our modern technologies. In fact, one typeof nanocomposite is currently being used in high-performance tennis balls. These balls retain theiroriginal pressure and bounce twice as long as con-ventional ones. Air permeation through the wallsof the ball is inhibited by a factor of two due to thepresence of a flexible and very thin (10 to 50 )nanocomposite barrier coating that covers the in-ner core; 4a schematic diagram of the cross-sectionmmof one of these tennis balls is shown in Figure 16.19.Because of their outstanding characteristics, theseDouble Core™ balls have recently been selectedas the official balls for some of the major tennistournaments.

major tennistournaments. This nanocomposite coating consists of a ma- trix of butyl rubber, within which is embedded thinplatelets of vermiculite, 5a natural clay mineral. The vermiculite platelets exist as single-moleculethin sheets—on the order of a nanometer thick—that have a very large aspect ratio (of about10,000); aspect ratio is the ratio of the lateral di- mensions of a platelet to its thickness. Furthermore, 4This coating was developed by InMat Inc., and is called Air D-Fense™. Wilson Sporting Goods has incorpo- rated this coating in its Double Core™ tennis balls. 5Vermiculite is one member of the layered silicates group that is discussed in Section 12.3.1496T_c16_577-620 12/9/05 17:14 Page 612REVISED PAGESSummary •613 the vermiculite platelets are exfoliated—that is, they remain separated from one another. Also, within the butyl rubber, the vermiculite plateletsare aligned such that all their lateral axes lie in thesame plane; and throughout this barrier coatingthere are multiple layers of these platelets (per theinset of Figure 16.19). The presence of the vermiculite platelets ac- counts for the ability of the nanocomposite coatingto more effectively retain air pressure within thetennis balls. These platelets act as multi-layer bar-riers to the diffusion of air molecules, and slowdown the diffusion rate; that is, the diffusion pathlength of air molecules is enhanced significantlysince they (the air molecules) must bypass theseparticles as they diffuse through the coating. Also,the addition of the particles to the butyl rubberdoes not diminish its flexibility. It is anticipated that this type of coating can also be applied to other kinds of sporting equip-ment (i.e., soccer balls, footballs, bicycle tires), aswell as to automobile tires (which would be lighterin weight and more recyclable).

SUMMARY Introduction Composites are artificially produced multiphase materials having a desirable com- bination of the best properties of the constituent phases. Usually, one phase (thematrix) is continuous and completely surrounds the other (the dispersed phase). Inthis discussion, composites were classified as particle-reinforced, fiber-reinforced,and structural.1496T_c16_577-620 12/9/05 17:14 Page 613REVISED PAGESLarge-Particle Composites Dispersion-Strengthened Composites Large-particle and dispersion-strengthened composites fall within the particle- reinforced classification. For dispersion strengthening, improved strength isachieved by extremely small particles of the dispersed phase, which inhibit dis-location motion; that is, the strengthening mechanism involves interactions thatmay be treated on the atomic level. The particle size is normally greater withlarge-particle composites, whose mechanical characteristics are enhanced byreinforcement action. Concrete, a type of large-particle composite, consists of an aggregate of particles bonded together with cement. In the case of portland cement concrete, the aggregateconsists of sand and gravel; the cementitious bond develops as a result of chemicalreactions between the portland cement and water. The mechanical strength of thisconcrete may be improved by reinforcement methods (e.g., embedment into the freshconcrete of steel rods, wires, etc.). Additional reinforcement is possible by the imposi-tion of residual compressive stresses using prestressing and posttensioning techniques.

posttensioning techniques. Influence of Fiber Length The Fiber Phase Of the several composite types, the potential for reinforcement efficiency is great- est for those that are fiber reinforced. With these composites an applied load istransmitted to and distributed among the fibers via the matrix phase, which in mostcases is at least moderately ductile. Significant reinforcement is possible only if thematrix–fiber bond is strong. On the basis of diameter, fiber reinforcements are clas-sified as whiskers, fibers, or wires. Since reinforcement discontinues at the fiber ex-tremities, reinforcement efficiency depends on fiber length. For each fiber–matrixcombination, there exists some critical length; the length of continuous fibers greatlyexceeds this critical value, whereas shorter fibers are discontinuous. Influence of Fiber Orientation and Concentration Fiber arrangement is also crucial relative to composite characteristics. The mechan- ical properties of continuous and aligned fiber composites are highly anisotropic. Inthe alignment direction, reinforcement and strength are a maximum; perpendicularto the alignment, they are a minimum. The stress–strain behavior for longitudinalloading was discussed. Composite rule-of-mixture expressions for the modulus inboth longitudinal and transverse orientations were developed; in addition, an equationfor longitudinal strength was also cited. For short and discontinuous fibrous composites, the fibers may be either aligned or randomly oriented. Significant strengths and stiffnesses are possible for alignedshort-fiber composites in the longitudinal direction. Despite some limitations on re-inforcement efficiency, the properties of randomly oriented short-fiber compositesare isotropic. Polymer-Matrix Composites Metal-Matrix CompositesCeramic-Matrix CompositesCarbon-Carbon CompositesHybrid Composites Fibrous-reinforced composites are sometimes classified according to matrix type; within this scheme are three classifications: polymer-, metal-, and ceramic-matrix.614 •Chapter 16 / Composites 1496T_c16_577-620 12/9/05 17:14 Page 614REVISED PAGESPolymer-matrix are the most common, which may be reinforced with glass, car- bon, and aramid fibers.

aramid fibers. Service temperatures are higher for metal-matrix com-posites, which also utilize a variety of fiber and whisker types. The objective ofmany polymer- and metal-matrix composites is a high specific strength and/orspecific modulus, which requires matrix materials having low densities. Withceramic-matrix composites, the design goal is increased fracture toughness. Thisis achieved by interactions between advancing cracks and dispersed phase par-ticles; transformation toughening is one such technique for improving Othermore advanced composites are carbon–carbon (carbon fibers embedded in apyrolyzed carbon matrix) and the hybrids (containing at least two different fibertypes). Processing of Fiber-Reinforced Composites Several composite processing techniques have been developed that provide a uni- form fiber distribution and a high degree of alignment.With pultrusion, componentsof continuous length and constant cross section are formed as resin-impregnatedfiber tows are pulled through a die. Composites utilized for many structural appli-cations are commonly prepared using a lay-up operation (either hand or automated),wherein prepreg tape plies are laid down on a tooled surface and are subsequentlyfully cured by the simultaneous application of heat and pressure. Some hollow struc-tures may be fabricated using automated filament winding procedures, wherebyresin-coated strands or tows or prepreg tape are continuously wound onto a mandrel,followed by a curing operation. Laminar Composites Sandwich Panels Two general kinds of structural composites were discussed: the laminar compos- ites and sandwich panels. The properties of laminar composites are virtuallyisotropic in a two-dimensional plane. This is made possible with several sheets ofa highly anisotropic composite, which are cemented onto one another such thatthe high-strength direction is varied with each successive layer. Sandwich panelsconsist of two strong and stiff sheet faces that are separated by a core material orstructure.

These structures combine relatively high strengths and stiffnesses withlow densities.K lc.Important Terms and Concepts •615 IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS Carbon–carbon compositeCeramic-matrix compositeCermetConcreteDispersed phaseDispersion-strengthened compositeFiberFiber-reinforced compositeHybrid compositeLaminar compositeLarge-particle compositeLongitudinal directionMatrix phaseMetal-matrix compositePolymer-matrix compositePrepregPrestressed concretePrinciple of combined actionReinforced concreteRule of mixturesSandwich panelSpecific modulusSpecific strengthStructural compositeTransverse directionWhisker1496T_c16_577-620 12/9/05 17:14 Page 615REVISED PAGES616 •Chapter 16 / Composites REFERENCES Agarwal, B.

diverse environments. Often, such interactions impair a mate-rial’s usefulness as a result of the deterioration of its mechanical properties (e.g.,ductility and strength), other physical properties, or appearance. Occasionally, to thechagrin of a design engineer, the degradation behavior of a material for someapplication is ignored, with adverse consequences. Deteriorative mechanisms are different for the three material types. In metals, there is actual material loss either by dissolution (corrosion) or by the formation of nonmetallic scale or film (oxidation) .Ceramic materials are relatively resistant to deterioration, which usually occurs at elevated temperatures or in rather extremeenvironments; the process is frequently also called corrosion. For polymers, mech-anisms and consequences differ from those for metals and ceramics, and the termdegradation is most frequently used. Polymers may dissolve when exposed to a liquid solvent, or they may absorb the solvent and swell; also, electromagneticradiation (primarily ultraviolet) and heat may cause alterations in their molecularstructures. The deterioration of each of these material types is discussed in this chapter, with special regard to mechanism, resistance to attack by various environments, andmeasures to prevent or reduce degradation. Corrosion of Metals Corrosion is defined as the destructive and unintentional attack of a metal; it iselectrochemical and ordinarily begins at the surface. The problem of metallic cor-rosion is one of significant proportions; in economic terms, it has been estimatedthat approximately 5% of an industrialized nation’s income is spent on corrosionprevention and the maintenance or replacement of products lost or contaminatedas a result of corrosion reactions.The consequences of corrosion are all too common.Familiar examples include the rusting of automotive body panels and radiator andexhaust components.Learning Objectives After careful study of this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1.Distinguish between oxidation and reduction electrochemical reactions. 2.Describe the following: galvanic couple, standardhalf-cell, and standard hydrogen electrode.

hydrogen electrode. 3.Compute the cell potential and write the spon-taneous electrochemical reaction direction fortwo pure metals that are electrically connectedand also submerged in solutions of their respec-tive ions. 4.Determine metal oxidation rate given the reac-tion current density. 5.Name and briefly describe the two differenttypes of polarization, and specify the conditionsunder which each is rate controlling.6.For each of the eight forms of corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement, describe the natureof the deteriorative process, and then note theproposed mechanism. 7.List five measures that are commonly used toprevent corrosion. 8.Explain why ceramic materials are, in general,very resistant to corrosion. 9.For polymeric materials discuss (a) two degrada-tion processes that occur when they areexposed to liquid solvents, and (b) the causesand consequences of molecular chain bondrupture. corrosion degradation1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 622REVISED PAGESCorrosion processes are occasionally used to advantage. For example, etching procedures, as discussed in Section 4.10, make use of the selective chemical reac- tivity of grain boundaries or various microstructural constituents. 17.2 ELECTROCHEMICAL CONSIDERATIONS For metallic materials, the corrosion process is normally electrochemical, that is,a chemical reaction in which there is transfer of electrons from one chemicalspecies to another. Metal atoms characteristically lose or give up electrons inwhat is called an oxidation reaction. For example, the hypothetical metal M that has a valence of n(or nvalence electrons) may experience oxidation according to the reaction (17.1) in which M becomes an n/H11001 positively charged ion and in the process loses its n valence electrons; is used to symbolize an electron. Examples in which metalsoxidize are (17.2a) (17.2b) The site at which oxidation takes place is called the anode; oxidation is sometimes called an anodic reaction.

anodic reaction. The electrons generated from each metal atom that is oxidized must be trans- ferred to and become a part of another chemical species in what is termed areduction reaction. For example, some metals undergo corrosion in acid solutions, which have a high concentration of hydrogen (H /H11001) ions; the H/H11001ions are reduced as follows: (17.3) and hydrogen gas (H 2) is evolved. Other reduction reactions are possible, depending on the nature of the solution to which the metal is exposed. For an acid solution having dissolved oxygen,reduction according to (17.4) will probably occur. Or, for a neutral or basic aqueous solution in which oxygen isalso dissolved, (17.5) Any metal ions present in the solution may also be reduced; for ions that can existin more than one valence state (multivalent ions), reduction may occur by (17.6) in which the metal ion decreases its valence state by accepting an electron. Or ametal may be totally reduced from an ionic to a neutral metallic state according to (17.7) M n/H11001/H11001ne/H11002¡ MMn/H11001/H11001e/H11002¡ M1n/H1100212/H11001O2/H110012H2O/H110014e/H11002¡ 41OH/H110022O2/H110014H/H11001/H110014e/H11002¡ 2H2O2H/H11001/H110012e/H11002¡ H2Al¡ Al3/H11001/H110013e/H11002Fe¡ Fe2/H11001/H110012e/H11002e/H11002M¡ Mn/H11001/H11001ne/H1100217.2 Electrochemical Considerations •623 oxidation Oxidation reaction for metal M anode reduction Reduction of hydrogen ions inan acid solution Reduction reaction in an acid solutioncontaining dissolvedoxygen Reduction reaction in a neutral or basicsolution containingdissolved oxygen Reduction of a multivalent metalion to a lowervalence state Reduction of a metal ion to its electricallyneutral atom1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 623REVISED PAGESZincZnZn2+ e–e– H+ H+H2Acid solutionFigure 17.1 The electrochemical reactions associated with the corrosion of zinc in an acid solution.

The location at which reduction occurs is called the cathode. Furthermore, it is pos- sible for two or more of the reduction reactions above to occur simultaneously. An overall electrochemical reaction must consist of at least one oxidation and one reduction reaction, and will be the sum of them; often the individual oxidation and reduction reactions are termed half-reactions. There can be no net electrical charge accumulation from the electrons and ions; that is, the total rate of oxidationmust equal the total rate of reduction, or all electrons generated through oxidationmust be consumed by reduction. For example, consider zinc metal immersed in an acid solution containing H /H11001 ions. At some regions on the metal surface, zinc will experience oxidation or cor-rosion as illustrated in Figure 17.1, and according to the reaction (17.8) Since zinc is a metal, and therefore a good electrical conductor, these electronsmay be transferred to an adjacent region at which the H /H11001ions are reduced according to (17.9) If no other oxidation or reduction reactions occur, the total electrochemical reac-tion is just the sum of reactions 17.8 and 17.9, or (17.10) Another example is the oxidation or rusting of iron in water, which contains dissolved oxygen. This process occurs in two steps; in the first, Fe is oxidized to Fe2/H11001 [as Fe(OH) 2], (17.11) and, in the second stage, to Fe3/H11001[as Fe(OH) 3] according to (17.12) The compound Fe(OH) 3is the all too familiar rust. As a consequence of oxidation, the metal ions may either go into the corrod- ing solution as ions (reaction 17.8), or they may form an insoluble compound withnonmetallic elements as in reaction 17.12.2Fe1OH2 2/H110011 2 O2/H11001H2O¡ 2Fe1OH23Fe/H110011 2 O2/H11001H2O¡ Fe2/H11001/H110012OH/H11002¡ Fe1OH22 Zn/H110012H/H11001¡ Zn2/H11001/H11001H2 1gas2 2H/H11001/H110012e/H11002¡ H2 1gas2 Zn¡ Zn2/H11001/H110012e/H110022H/H11001/H110012e/H11002¡ H2 1gas2Zn¡ Zn2/H11001/H110012e/H11002624 •Chapter 17 / Corrosion and Degradation of Materials cathode1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 624REVISED PAGESFigure 17.2 An electrochemical cell consisting of iron and copper electrodes, each of which is immersed in a 1 Msolution of its ion.

On the left-hand side is a pieceof pure iron immersed in a solution containing Fe 2/H11001ions of 1M concentration.1The other side of the cell consists of a pure copper electrode in a 1 Msolution of Cu2/H11001 ions. The cell halves are separated by a membrane, which limits the mixing of thetwo solutions. If the iron and copper electrodes are connected electrically, reduc-tion will occur for copper at the expense of the oxidation of iron, as follows: (17.13) or Cu 2/H11001ions will deposit (electrodeposit) as metallic copper on the copper elec- trode, while iron dissolves (corrodes) on the other side of the cell and goes intosolution as Fe 2/H11001ions. Thus, the two half-cell reactions are represented by the relations (17.14a) (17.14b) When a current passes through the external circuit, electrons generated from the ox-idation of iron flow to the copper cell in order that Cu 2/H11001be reduced.

This is called a galvanic couple—two metals electrically connected in a liquid electrolyte wherein one metal becomes an anode and corrodes, while the other acts as a cathode. An electric potential or voltage will exist between the two cell halves, and its magnitude can be determined if a voltmeter is connected in the external circuit. Apotential of 0.780 V results for a copper–iron galvanic cell when the temperatureis Now consider another galvanic couple consisting of the same iron half-cell con- nected to a metal zinc electrode that is immersed in a 1 Msolution of Zn 2/H11001ions (Figure 17.3). In this case the zinc is the anode and corrodes, whereas the Fe nowbecomes the cathode. The electrochemical reaction is thus (17.15) The potential associated with this cell reaction is 0.323 V . Thus, various electrode pairs have different voltages; the magnitude of such a voltage may be thought of as representing the driving force for the electrochemicaloxidation–reduction reaction. Consequently, metallic materials may be rated as totheir tendency to experience oxidation when coupled to other metals in solutionsof their respective ions. A half-cell similar to those described above [i.e., a puremetal electrode immersed in a 1 Msolution of its ions and at ] is termed a standard half-cell.

The Standard emf Series These measured cell voltages represent only differences in electrical potential, andthus it is convenient to establish a reference point, or reference cell, to which othercell halves may be compared. This reference cell, arbitrarily chosen, is the standardhydrogen electrode (Figure 17.4). It consists of an inert platinum electrode in a 1 M solution of H /H11001ions, saturated with hydrogen gas that is bubbled through the solu- tion at a pressure of 1 atm and a temperature of The platinum itself does not take part in the electrochemical reaction; it acts only as a surface on which hydrogenatoms may be oxidized or hydrogen ions may be reduced.

Influence of Concentration and Temperature on Cell Potential The emf series applies to highly idealized electrochemical cells (i.e., pure metals in 1Msolutions of their ions, at ). Altering temperature or solution concentration or using alloy electrodes instead of pure metals will change the cell potential, and,in some cases, the spontaneous reaction direction may be reversed.

the metals. Amore realistic and practical ranking, however, is provided by the galvanic series, Table 17.2. This represents the relative reactivities of a number of metals and com-mercial alloys in seawater. The alloys near the top are cathodic and unreactive, galvanic series1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 629REVISED PAGESwhereas those at the bottom are most anodic; no voltages are provided. Comparison of the standard emf and the galvanic series reveals a high degree of correspondencebetween the relative positions of the pure base metals. Most metals and alloys are subject to oxidation or corrosion to one degree or another in a wide variety of environments; that is, they are more stable in an ionicstate than as metals. In thermodynamic terms, there is a net decrease in free energyin going from metallic to oxidized states. Consequently, essentially all metals occurin nature as compounds—for example, oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, silicates, sul-fides, and sulfates. Two notable exceptions are the noble metals gold and platinum.For them, oxidation in most environments is not favorable, and, therefore, they mayexist in nature in the metallic state. 17.3 CORROSION RATES The half-cell potentials listed in Table 17.1 are thermodynamic parameters thatrelate to systems at equilibrium. For example, for the discussions pertaining toFigures 17.2 and 17.3, it was tacitly assumed that there was no current flow throughthe external circuit. Real corroding systems are not at equilibrium; there will be aflow of electrons from anode to cathode (corresponding to the short-circuiting ofthe electrochemical cells in Figures 17.2 and 17.3), which means that the half-cellpotential parameters (Table 17.1) cannot be applied.

Thatis, even though a potential computed for a specific corrosion situation usingEquation 17.20 is a relatively large positive number, the reaction may occur at onlyan insignificantly slow rate. From an engineering perspective, we are interested inpredicting the rates at which systems corrode; this requires the utilization of otherparameters, as discussed below. The corrosion rate, or the rate of material removal as a consequence of the chemical action, is an important corrosion parameter. This may be expressed as thecorrosion penetration rate (CPR), or the thickness loss of material per unit of time.

of time. The formula for this calculation is (17.23) where Wis the weight loss after exposure time t; and Arepresent the density and exposed specimen area, respectively, and Kis a constant, its magnitude depending on the system of units used. The CPR is conveniently expressed in terms of either milsper year (mpy) or millimeters per year (mm/yr).

In thesecond case, for mm/yr, and units for the other parameters are the same asfor mils per year, except that Ais given in square centimeters. For most applications a corrosion penetration rate less than about 20 mpy (0.50 mm/yr) is acceptable. Inasmuch as there is an electric current associated with electrochemical corro- sion reactions, we can also express corrosion rate in terms of this current, or, morespecifically, current density—that is, the current per unit surface area of materialcorroding—which is designated i. The rate r, in units of mol/m 2-s, is determined using the expression (17.24) where, again, nis the number of electrons associated with the ionization of each metal atom, and is 96,500 C/mol. 17.4 PREDICTION OF CORROSION RATES Polarization Consider the standard Zn/H 2electrochemical cell shown in Figure 17.5, which has been short-circuited such that oxidation of zinc and reduction of hydrogen will occur at theirrespective electrode surfaces. The potentials of the two electrodes will not be at thevalues determined from Table 17.1 because the system is now a nonequilibrium one.The displacement of each electrode potential from its equilibrium value is termedpolarization, and the magnitude of this displacement is the overvoltage, normally rep- resented by the symbol Overvoltage is expressed in terms of plus or minus volts (ormillivolts) relative to the equilibrium potential.

Activation Polarization All electrochemical reactions consist of a sequence of steps that occur in series at the interface between the metal electrode and the electrolyte solution. Activation polarization refers to the condition wherein the reaction rate is controlled by the one step in the series that occurs at the slowest rate.The term “activation” is appliedto this type of polarization because an activation energy barrier is associated withthis slowest, rate-limiting step.

rate-limiting step. To illustrate, let us consider the reduction of hydrogen ions to form bubbles of hydrogen gas on the surface of a zinc electrode (Figure 17.6). It is conceivable thatthis reaction could proceed by the following step sequence: 1.Adsorption of H /H11001ions from the solution onto the zinc surface 2.Electron transfer from the zinc to form a hydrogen atom, 3.Combining of two hydrogen atoms to form a molecule of hydrogen, 2H¡ H2H/H11001/H11001e/H11002¡ H632 •Chapter 17 / Corrosion and Degradation of Materials activation polarization Figure 17.6 Schematic representation of possible steps in the hydrogen reduction reaction, the rate of whichis controlled by activationpolarization.

For activation polarization, the relationship between overvoltage and current density iis (17.25) where and are constants for the particular half-cell. The parameter is termed the exchange current density, which deserves a brief explanation. Equilibrium for some particular half-cell reaction is really a dynamic state on the atomic level. Thatis, oxidation and reduction processes are occurring, but both at the same rate, sothat there is no net reaction. For example, for the standard hydrogen cell (Fig-ure 17.4) reduction of hydrogen ions in solution will take place at the surface ofthe platinum electrode according to with a corresponding rate Similarly, hydrogen gas in the solution will experi- ence oxidation as at rate Equilibrium exists when This exchange current density is just the current density from Equation 17.24 at equilibrium, or (17.26) Use of the term “current density” for is a little misleading inasmuch as there isno net current.

Also worthnoting is that both line segments originate at the exchange current density,and at zero overvoltage, since at this point the system is at equilibrium and there is nonet reaction. Concentration Polarization Concentration polarization exists when the reaction rate is limited by diffusion in the solution. For example, consider again the hydrogen evolution reduction reac- tion. When the reaction rate is low and/or the concentration of is high, thereis always an adequate supply of hydrogen ions available in the solution at the re-gion near the electrode interface (Figure 17.8 a). On the other hand, at high rates and/or low concentrations, a depletion zone may be formed in the vicinity ofthe interface, inasmuch as the ions are not replenished at a rate sufficient tokeep up with the reaction (Figure 17.8 b). Thus, diffusion of to the interface is rate controlling, and the system is said to be concentration polarized. Concentration polarization data are also normally plotted as overvoltage versus the logarithm of current density; such a plot is represented schematicallyin Figure 17.9 a. 2It may be noted from this figure that overvoltage is independentH/H11001H/H11001H/H11001H/H11001i0 (H2/H/H11001),a /H11002b/H11001b634 •Chapter 17 / Corrosion and Degradation of Materials 2The mathematical expression relating concentration polarization overvoltage and current density i is (17.27) where Rand Tare the gas constant and absolute temperature, respectively, nand have the same meanings as above, and is the limiting diffusion current density.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Corrosion Rates from Polarization Data Let us now apply the concepts developed above to the determination of corrosionrates. Two types of systems will be discussed. In the first case, both oxidation andreduction reactions are rate limited by activation polarization. In the second case,both concentration and activation polarization control the reduction reaction, whereasonly activation polarization is important for oxidation. Case one will be illustratedby considering the corrosion of zinc immersed in an acid solution (see Figure 17.1).hh c iL;1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 635REVISED PAGESThe reduction of ions to form gas bubbles occurs at the surface of the zinc according to (17.3) and the zinc oxidizes as (17.8) No net charge accumulation may result from these two reactions; that is, all electronsgenerated by reaction 17.8 must be consumed by reaction 17.3, which is to say thatrates of oxidation and reduction must be equal.

Activation polarization for both reactions is expressed graphically in Figure 17.10 as cell potential referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode (not overvoltage)versus the logarithm of current density. The potentials of the uncoupled hydrogenand zinc half-cells, and respectively, are indicated, along with their respective exchange current densities, and Straight line segments are shown for hydrogen reduction and zinc oxidation. Upon immersion,both hydrogen and zinc experience activation polarization along their respectivelines. Also, oxidation and reduction rates must be equal as explained above, whichis only possible at the intersection of the two line segments; this intersection occursat the corrosion potential, designated and the corrosion current density Thecorrosion rate of zinc (which also corresponds to the rate of hydrogen evolution)may thus be computed by insertion of this value into Equation 17.24. The second corrosion case (combined activation and concentration polariza- tion for hydrogen reduction and activation polarization for oxidation of metal M)is treated in a like manner. Figure 17.11 shows both polarization curves; as above,corrosion potential and corrosion current density correspond to the point at whichthe oxidation and reduction lines intersect.i CiC.

Next, these two expressions are set equalto one another, and then we solve for the value of ithat is the corrosion current density, Finally, the corrosion rate may be calculated using Equa-tion 17.24.

their alloys. It is felt that this passive behavior results from the formation of a highly adherentand very thin oxide film on the metal surface, which serves as a protective barrier passivity1496T_c17_621-664 12/31/05 14:10 Page 6382nd REVISE PAGES17.5 Passivity •639 to further corrosion. Stainless steels are highly resistant to corrosion in a rather wide variety of atmospheres as a result of passivation. They contain at least 11%chromium that, as a solid-solution alloying element in iron, minimizes the forma-tion of rust; instead, a protective surface film forms in oxidizing atmospheres. (Stain-less steels are susceptible to corrosion in some environments, and therefore are notalways “stainless.”) Aluminum is highly corrosion resistant in many environmentsbecause it also passivates. If damaged, the protective film normally reforms veryrapidly. However, a change in the character of the environment (e.g., alteration inthe concentration of the active corrosive species) may cause a passivated materialto revert to an active state. Subsequent damage to a preexisting passive film couldresult in a substantial increase in corrosion rate, by as much as 100,000 times. This passivation phenomenon may be explained in terms of polarization potential–log current density curves discussed in the preceding section. The polar-ization curve for a metal that passivates will have the general shape shown inFigure 17.12. At relatively low potential values, within the “active” region the be-havior is linear as it is for normal metals. With increasing potential, the current den-sity suddenly decreases to a very low value that remains independent of potential;this is termed the “passive” region. Finally, at even higher potential values, the cur-rent density again increases with potential in the “transpassive” region.

“transpassive” region. Figure 17.13 illustrates how a metal can experience both active and passive behavior depending on the corrosion environment. Included in this figure is theS-shaped oxidation polarization curve for an active–passive metal M and, in addi-tion, reduction polarization curves for two different solutions, which are labeled 1and 2. Curve 1 intersects the oxidation polarization curve in the active region atpoint A, yielding a corrosion current density (A). The intersection of curve 2 atpoint B is in the passive region and at current density (B). The corrosion rateof metal M in solution 1 is greater than in solution 2 since (A) is greater than (B) and rate is proportional to current density according to Equation 17.24. This difference in corrosion rate between the two solutions may be significant—severalorders of magnitude—when one considers that the current density scale in Figure 17.13is scaled logarithmically.i CiCiCiC Log current density, iElectrochemical potential, VTranspassive Passive Active V (M/M2+)M2+ + 2e– M i0 (M/M2+)Figure 17.12 Schematic polarization curve for a metal that displays an active–passivetransition.1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 10:41 Page 639REVISED PAGESElectrochemical potential, V Log current density, ii0 (1) i0 (2) i0 (M/M2+) iC (B) iC (A)B A12Figure 17.13 Demonstration of how an active–passive metal can exhibit both active andpassive corrosion behaviors. 17.6 ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS The variables in the corrosion environment, which include fluid velocity, temperature, and composition, can have a decided influence on the corrosion properties of the ma-terials that are in contact with it.

with it. In most instances, increasing fluid velocity enhancesthe rate of corrosion due to erosive effects, as discussed later in the chapter. The ratesof most chemical reactions rise with increasing temperature; this also holds for thegreat majority of corrosion situations. Increasing the concentration of the corrosivespecies (e.g., H /H11001ions in acids) in many situations produces a more rapid rate of cor- rosion. However, for materials capable of passivation, raising the corrosive contentmay result in an active-to-passive transition, with a considerable reduction in corrosion. Cold working or plastically deforming ductile metals is used to increase their strength; however, a cold-worked metal is more susceptible to corrosion than thesame material in an annealed state. For example, deformation processes are used toshape the head and point of a nail; consequently, these positions are anodic with re-spect to the shank region. Thus, differential cold working on a structure should be aconsideration when a corrosive environment may be encountered during service. 17.7 FORMS OF CORROSION It is convenient to classify corrosion according to the manner in which it is mani-fest. Metallic corrosion is sometimes classified into eight forms: uniform, galvanic,crevice, pitting, intergranular, selective leaching, erosion–corrosion, and stress cor-rosion. The causes and means of prevention of each of these forms are discussedbriefly. In addition, we have elected to discuss the topic of hydrogen embrittlementin this section. Hydrogen embrittlement is, in a strict sense, a type of failure ratherthan a form of corrosion; however, it is often produced by hydrogen that is generatedfrom corrosion reactions. Uniform Attack Uniform attack is a form of electrochemical corrosion that occurs with equivalent in-tensity over the entire exposed surface and often leaves behind a scale or deposit.

or deposit. Ina microscopic sense, the oxidation and reduction reactions occur randomly over the640 •Chapter 17 / Corrosion and Degradation of Materials1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 640REVISED PAGESsurface. Some familiar examples include general rusting of steel and iron and the tar- nishing of silverware. This is probably the most common form of corrosion. It is alsothe least objectionable because it can be predicted and designed for with relative ease. Galvanic Corrosion Galvanic corrosion occurs when two metals or alloys having different compositions are electrically coupled while exposed to an electrolyte. This is the type of corrosionor dissolution that was described in Section 17.2. The less noble or more reactivemetal in the particular environment will experience corrosion; the more inert metal,the cathode, will be protected from corrosion. For example, steel screws corrodewhen in contact with brass in a marine environment; or if copper and steel tubingare joined in a domestic water heater, the steel will corrode in the vicinity of thejunction. Depending on the nature of the solution, one or more of the reductionreactions, Equations 17.3 through 17.7, will occur at the surface of the cathodematerial. Figure 17.14 shows galvanic corrosion. Again, the galvanic series (Table 17.2) indicates the relative reactivities, in sea- water, of a number of metals and alloys. When two alloys are coupled in seawater,the one lower in the series will experience corrosion. Some of the alloys in the tableare grouped in brackets. Generally the base metal is the same for these bracketedalloys, and there is little danger of corrosion if alloys within a single bracket arecoupled. It is also worth noting from this series that some alloys are listed twice(e.g., nickel and the stainless steels), in both active and passive states.17.7 Forms of Corrosion •641 galvanic corrosion Steel core Galvanic corrosion Magnesium shellFigure 17.14 Photograph showing galvanic corrosion around the inlet of a single-cyclebilge pump that is found onfishing vessels.

(Photograph courtesy ofLaQue Center for CorrosionTechnology, Inc.)1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 641REVISED PAGESThe rate of galvanic attack depends on the relative anode-to-cathode surface areas that are exposed to the electrolyte, and the rate is related directly to the cath- ode–anode area ratio; that is, for a given cathode area, a smaller anode will corrodemore rapidly than a larger one. The reason for this is that corrosion rate dependson current density (Equation 17.24), the current per unit area of corroding surface,and not simply the current. Thus, a high current density results for the anode whenits area is small relative to that of the cathode. A number of measures may be taken to significantly reduce the effects of galvanic corrosion. These include the following: 1.If coupling of dissimilar metals is necessary, choose two that are closetogether in the galvanic series. 2.Avoid an unfavorable anode-to-cathode surface area ratio; use an anode areaas large as possible. 3.Electrically insulate dissimilar metals from each other. 4.Electrically connect a third, anodic metal to the other two; this is a form ofcathodic protection, discussed presently. Concept Check 17.4 (a)From the galvanic series (Table 17.2), cite three metals or alloys that may be used to galvanically protect nickel in the active state.

Hint: One example is cited later in this chapter. [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Crevice Corrosion Electrochemical corrosion may also occur as a consequence of concentration dif-ferences of ions or dissolved gases in the electrolyte solution, and between two re-gions of the same metal piece. For such a concentration cell, corrosion occurs in the locale that has the lower concentration. A good example of this type of corrosionoccurs in crevices and recesses or under deposits of dirt or corrosion products wherethe solution becomes stagnant and there is localized depletion of dissolved oxygen.Corrosion preferentially occurring at these positions is called crevice corrosion (Figure 17.15). The crevice must be wide enough for the solution to penetrate, yetnarrow enough for stagnancy; usually the width is several thousandths of an inch. The proposed mechanism for crevice corrosion is illustrated in Figure 17.16. After oxygen has been depleted within the crevice, oxidation of the metal occurs at642 •Chapter 17 / Corrosion and Degradation of Materials crevice corrosioncathodic protection1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 10:41 Page 642REVISED PAGESFigure 17.16 Schematic illustration of the mechanism of crevice corrosion between two riveted sheets.

Electrons from this electrochemical reac- tion are conducted through the metal to adjacent external regions, where they areconsumed by reduction—most probably reaction 17.5. In many aqueous environ-ments, the solution within the crevice has been found to develop high concentrationsof H /H11001and Cl/H11002ions, which are especially corrosive. Many alloys that passivate are susceptible to crevice corrosion because protective films are often destroyed by theH /H11001and Cl/H11002ions. Crevice corrosion may be prevented by using welded instead of riveted or bolted joints, using nonabsorbing gaskets when possible, removing accumulated depositsfrequently, and designing containment vessels to avoid stagnant areas and ensurecomplete drainage. Pitting Pitting is another form of very localized corrosion attack in which small pits or holes form. They ordinarily penetrate from the top of a horizontal surface downward ina nearly vertical direction. It is an extremely insidious type of corrosion, often going17.7 Forms of Corrosion •643 pitting1496T_c17_621-664 12/31/05 14:10 Page 6432nd REVISE PAGESFigure 17.17 The pitting of a 304 stainless steel plate by an acid-chloride solution.

Reproduced withpermission. )© undetected and with very little material loss until failure occurs. An example of pitting corrosion is shown in Figure 17.17. The mechanism for pitting is probably the same as for crevice corrosion in that oxidation occurs within the pit itself, with complementary reduction at the surface.It is supposed that gravity causes the pits to grow downward, the solution at the pittip becoming more concentrated and dense as pit growth progresses.

growth progresses. A pit may beinitiated by a localized surface defect such as a scratch or a slight variation in com-position. In fact, it has been observed that specimens having polished surfacesdisplay a greater resistance to pitting corrosion. Stainless steels are somewhatsusceptible to this form of corrosion; however, alloying with about 2% molybdenumenhances their resistance significantly. Concept Check 17.6 Is Equation 17.23 equally valid for uniform corrosion and pitting? Why or why not? [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Intergranular Corrosion As the name suggests, intergranular corrosion occurs preferentially along grain boundaries for some alloys and in specific environments. The net result is that amacroscopic specimen disintegrates along its grain boundaries. This type of cor-rosion is especially prevalent in some stainless steels. When heated to tempera-tures between 500 and (950 and ) for sufficiently long time periods,these alloys become sensitized to intergranular attack. It is believed that this heattreatment permits the formation of small precipitate particles of chromium car-bide by reaction between the chromium and carbon in the stainless steel.These particles form along the grain boundaries, as illustrated in Figure 17.18.Both the chromium and the carbon must diffuse to the grain boundaries to formthe precipitates, which leaves a chromium-depleted zone adjacent to the grainboundary. Consequently, this grain boundary region is now highly susceptible tocorrosion.1Cr 23C621450/H11034F 800/H11034C644 •Chapter 17 / Corrosion and Degradation of Materials intergranular corrosion1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 644REVISED PAGESFigure 17.19 Weld decay in a stainless steel.

Intergranular corrosion is an especially severe problem in the welding of stainless steels, when it is often termed weld decay. Figure 17.19 shows this type of intergranular corrosion. Stainless steels may be protected from intergranular corrosion by the following measures: (1) subjecting the sensitized material to a high-temperature heat treatment in which all the chromium carbide particles are redissolved, (2) lowering the carboncontent below 0.03 wt% C so that carbide formation is minimal, and (3) alloyingthe stainless steel with another metal such as niobium or titanium, which has agreater tendency to form carbides than does chromium so that the Cr remains insolid solution. Selective Leaching Selective leaching is found in solid solution alloys and occurs when one element or constituent is preferentially removed as a consequence of corrosion processes. Themost common example is the dezincification of brass, in which zinc is selectivelyleached from a copper–zinc brass alloy. The mechanical properties of the alloy are17.7 Forms of Corrosion •645 weld decay selective leaching1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 645REVISED PAGESFigure 17.20 Impingement failure of an elbow that was part of a steam condensate line.

Reproduced with permission.) significantly impaired, since only a porous mass of copper remains in the region that has been dezincified. In addition, the material changes from yellow to a red orcopper color. Selective leaching may also occur with other alloy systems in whichaluminum, iron, cobalt, chromium, and other elements are vulnerable to preferen-tial removal. Erosion–Corrosion Erosion–corrosion arises from the combined action of chemical attack and me- chanical abrasion or wear as a consequence of fluid motion. Virtually all metal al-loys, to one degree or another, are susceptible to erosion–corrosion. It is especiallyharmful to alloys that passivate by forming a protective surface film; the abrasiveaction may erode away the film, leaving exposed a bare metal surface. If the coatingis not capable of continuously and rapidly reforming as a protective barrier, corro-sion may be severe. Relatively soft metals such as copper and lead are also sensitiveto this form of attack. Usually it can be identified by surface grooves and waveshaving contours that are characteristic of the flow of the fluid. The nature of the fluid can have a dramatic influence on the corrosion behavior. Increasing fluid velocity normally enhances the rate of corrosion. Also, a solutionis more erosive when bubbles and suspended particulate solids are present. Erosion–corrosion is commonly found in piping, especially at bends, elbows, and abrupt changes in pipe diameter—positions where the fluid changes directionor flow suddenly becomes turbulent. Propellers, turbine blades, valves, and pumpsare also susceptible to this form of corrosion. Figure 17.20 illustrates the impinge-ment failure of an elbow fitting.

elbow fitting. One of the best ways to reduce erosion–corrosion is to change the design to eliminate fluid turbulence and impingement effects. Other materials may also beutilized that inherently resist erosion. Furthermore, removal of particulates andbubbles from the solution will lessen its ability to erode. Stress Corrosion Stress corrosion, sometimes termed stress corrosion cracking, results from the com- bined action of an applied tensile stress and a corrosive environment; both influ-ences are necessary. In fact, some materials that are virtually inert in a particularcorrosive medium become susceptible to this form of corrosion when a stress is646 •Chapter 17 / Corrosion and Degradation of Materials erosion–corrosion stress corrosion1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 646REVISED PAGESFigure 17.21 Photomicrograph showing intergranular stress corrosion cracking in brass. (From H. H. Uhlig and R. W. Revie, Corrosion and Corrosion Control, 3rd edition, Fig. 5, p. 335. Copyright 1985 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Reprinted by permission of John Wiley & Sons, Inc.) applied. Small cracks form and then propagate in a direction perpendicular to the stress (see the chapter-opening photograph for this chapter), with the result thatfailure may eventually occur. Failure behavior is characteristic of that for a brittlematerial, even though the metal alloy is intrinsically ductile. Furthermore, cracksmay form at relatively low stress levels, significantly below the tensile strength. Mostalloys are susceptible to stress corrosion in specific environments, especially at mod-erate stress levels. For example, most stainless steels stress corrode in solutions con-taining chloride ions, whereas brasses are especially vulnerable when exposed toammonia. Figure 17.21 is a photomicrograph in which an example of intergranularstress corrosion cracking in brass is shown.

is shown. The stress that produces stress corrosion cracking need not be externally applied; it may be a residual one that results from rapid temperature changes and unevencontraction, or for two-phase alloys in which each phase has a different coefficientof expansion. Also, gaseous and solid corrosion products that are entrapped internallycan give rise to internal stresses. Probably the best measure to take in reducing or totally eliminating stress cor- rosion is to lower the magnitude of the stress.This may be accomplished by reducingthe external load or increasing the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the appliedstress. Furthermore, an appropriate heat treatment may be used to anneal out anyresidual thermal stresses. Hydrogen Embrittlement Various metal alloys, specifically some steels, experience a significant reduction inductility and tensile strength when atomic hydrogen (H) penetrates into the mate-rial. This phenomenon is aptly referred to as hydrogen embrittlement; the terms17.7 Forms of Corrosion •647 hydrogen embrittlement1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 647REVISED PAGEShydrogen-induced cracking and hydrogen stress cracking are sometimes also used. Strictly speaking, hydrogen embrittlement is a type of failure; in response to ap- plied or residual tensile stresses, brittle fracture occurs catastrophically as cracksgrow and rapidly propagate. Hydrogen in its atomic form (H as opposed to the mo-lecular form, H 2) diffuses interstitially through the crystal lattice, and concentrations as low as several parts per million can lead to cracking. Furthermore, hydrogen-induced cracks are most often transgranular, although intergranular fracture isobserved for some alloy systems. A number of mechanisms have been proposed toexplain hydrogen embrittlement; most of them are based on the interference ofdislocation motion by the dissolved hydrogen. Hydrogen embrittlement is similar to stress corrosion (as discussed in the pre- ceding section) in that a normally ductile metal experiences brittle fracture whenexposed to both a tensile stress and a corrosive atmosphere.

corrosive atmosphere. However, these twophenomena may be distinguished on the basis of their interactions with appliedelectric currents. Whereas cathodic protection (Section 17.9) reduces or causes acessation of stress corrosion, it may, on the other hand, lead to the initiation orenhancement of hydrogen embrittlement. For hydrogen embrittlement to occur, some source of hydrogen must be pres- ent, and, in addition, the possibility for the formation of its atomic species. Situationswherein these conditions are met include the following: pickling 3of steels in sulfuric acid; electroplating; and the presence of hydrogen-bearing atmospheres (includingwater vapor) at elevated temperatures such as during welding and heat treatments.Also, the presence of what are termed “poisons” such as sulfur (i.e., H 2S) and arsenic compounds accelerates hydrogen embrittlement; these substances retard the formationof molecular hydrogen and thereby increase the residence time of atomic hydrogenon the metal surface. Hydrogen sulfide, probably the most aggressive poison, is foundin petroleum fluids, natural gas, oil-well brines, and geothermal fluids. High-strength steels are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement, and increasing strength tends to enhance the material’s susceptibility. Martensitic steels are espe-cially vulnerable to this type of failure; bainitic, ferritic, and spheroiditic steels aremore resilient. Furthermore, FCC alloys (austenitic stainless steels, and alloys ofcopper, aluminum, and nickel) are relatively resistant to hydrogen embrittlement,mainly because of their inherently high ductilities. However, strain hardening thesealloys will enhance their susceptibility to embrittlement. Some of the techniques commonly used to reduce the likelihood of hydrogen embrittlement include reducing the tensile strength of the alloy via a heat treatment,removal of the source of hydrogen, “baking” the alloy at an elevated temperatureto drive out any dissolved hydrogen, and substitution of a more embrittlement-resistant alloy.

embrittlement-resistant alloy. 17.8 CORROSION ENVIRONMENTS Corrosive environments include the atmosphere, aqueous solutions, soils, acids, bases,inorganic solvents, molten salts, liquid metals, and, last but not least, the human body.On a tonnage basis, atmospheric corrosion accounts for the greatest losses. Moisturecontaining dissolved oxygen is the primary corrosive agent, but other substances, in-cluding sulfur compounds and sodium chloride, may also contribute.This is especiallytrue of marine atmospheres, which are highly corrosive because of the presence of648 •Chapter 17 / Corrosion and Degradation of Materials 3Pickling is a procedure used to remove surface oxide scale from steel pieces by dipping them in a vat of hot, dilute sulfuric or hydrochloric acid.1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 648REVISED PAGESsodium chloride. Dilute sulfuric acid solutions (acid rain) in industrial environments can also cause corrosion problems. Metals commonly used for atmospheric applica-tions include alloys of aluminum and copper, and galvanized steel. Water environments can also have a variety of compositions and corrosion char- acteristics. Freshwater normally contains dissolved oxygen, as well as other miner-als several of which account for hardness. Seawater contains approximately 3.5%salt (predominantly sodium chloride), as well as some minerals and organic matter.Seawater is generally more corrosive than freshwater, frequently producing pittingand crevice corrosion. Cast iron, steel, aluminum, copper, brass, and some stainlesssteels are generally suitable for freshwater use, whereas titanium, brass, somebronzes, copper–nickel alloys, and nickel–chromium–molybdenum alloys are highlycorrosion resistant in seawater. Soils have a wide range of compositions and susceptibilities to corrosion.

to corrosion. Com- positional variables include moisture, oxygen, salt content, alkalinity, and acidity, aswell as the presence of various forms of bacteria. Cast iron and plain carbon steels,both with and without protective surface coatings, are found most economical forunderground structures. Because there are so many acids, bases, and organic solvents, no attempt is made to discuss these solutions in this text. Good references are available that treat thesetopics in detail. 17.9 CORROSION PREVENTION Some corrosion prevention methods were treated relative to the eight forms of cor-rosion; however, only the measures specific to each of the various corrosion typeswere discussed. Now, some more general techniques are presented; these include ma-terial selection, environmental alteration, design, coatings, and cathodic protection. Perhaps the most common and easiest way of preventing corrosion is through the judicious selection of materials once the corrosion environment has been char-acterized. Standard corrosion references are helpful in this respect. Here, cost maybe a significant factor. It is not always economically feasible to employ the materialthat provides the optimum corrosion resistance; sometimes, either another alloyand/or some other measure must be used. Changing the character of the environment, if possible, may also significantly influence corrosion. Lowering the fluid temperature and/or velocity usually pro-duces a reduction in the rate at which corrosion occurs. Many times increasing ordecreasing the concentration of some species in the solution will have a positiveeffect; for example, the metal may experience passivation. Inhibitors are substances that, when added in relatively low concentrations to the environment, decrease its corrosiveness. Of course, the specific inhibitor dependsboth on the alloy and on the corrosive environment. There are several mechanismsthat may account for the effectiveness of inhibitors. Some react with and virtuallyeliminate a chemically active species in the solution (such as dissolved oxygen).Other inhibitor molecules attach themselves to the corroding surface and interferewith either the oxidation or the reduction reaction, or form a very thin protectivecoating.

thin protectivecoating. Inhibitors are normally used in closed systems such as automobile radiatorsand steam boilers. Several aspects of design consideration have already been discussed, especially with regard to galvanic and crevice corrosion and erosion–corrosion. In addition,the design should allow for complete drainage in the case of a shutdown, and easywashing. Since dissolved oxygen may enhance the corrosivity of many solutions, thedesign should, if possible, include provision for the exclusion of air.17.9 Corrosion Prevention •649 inhibitor1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 649REVISED PAGESPhysical barriers to corrosion are applied on surfaces in the form of films and coatings. A large diversity of metallic and nonmetallic coating materials are avail- able. It is essential that the coating maintain a high degree of surface adhesion, whichundoubtedly requires some preapplication surface treatment. In most cases, the coat-ing must be virtually nonreactive in the corrosive environment and resistant to me-chanical damage that exposes the bare metal to the corrosive environment. All threematerial types—metals, ceramics, and polymers—are used as coatings for metals. Cathodic Protection One of the most effective means of corrosion prevention is cathodic protection; it can be used for all eight different forms of corrosion as discussed above, and may,in some situations, completely stop corrosion. Again, oxidation or corrosion of ametal M occurs by the generalized reaction (17.1) Cathodic protection simply involves supplying, from an external source, electronsto the metal to be protected, making it a cathode; the reaction above is thus forcedin the reverse (or reduction) direction. One cathodic protection technique employs a galvanic couple: the metal to be protected is electrically connected to another metal that is more reactive in the par-ticular environment.The latter experiences oxidation, and, upon giving up electrons,protects the first metal from corrosion.The oxidized metal is often called a sacrificialanode, and magnesium and zinc are commonly used as such because they lie at the anodic end of the galvanic series.

galvanic series. This form of galvanic protection, for structuresburied in the ground, is illustrated in Figure 17.22 a. The process of galvanizing is simply one in which a layer of zinc is applied to the surface of steel by hot dipping. In the atmosphere and most aqueous environments,zinc is anodic to and will thus cathodically protect the steel if there is any surfacedamage (Figure 17.23).Any corrosion of the zinc coating will proceed at an extremelyslow rate because the ratio of the anode-to-cathode surface area is quite large. For another method of cathodic protection, the source of electrons is an im- pressed current from an external dc power source, as represented in Figure 17.22 b for an underground tank. The negative terminal of the power source is connected tothe structure to be protected. The other terminal is joined to an inert anode (oftengraphite), which is, in this case, buried in the soil; high-conductivity backfill materialprovides good electrical contact between the anode and surrounding soil.

Concept Check 17.7 Tin cans are made of a steel the inside of which is coated with a thin layer of tin.The tin protects the steel from corrosion by food products in the same manner aszinc protects steel from atmospheric corrosion. Briefly explain how this cathodicprotection of tin cans is possible, given that tin is electrochemically less active thansteel in the galvanic series (Table 17.2). [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 17.10 OXIDATION The discussion of Section 17.2 treated the corrosion of metallic materials in termsof electrochemical reactions that take place in aqueous solutions. In addition, oxi-dation of metal alloys is also possible in gaseous atmospheres, normally air, whereinan oxide layer or scale forms on the surface of the metal. This phenomenon is fre-quently termed scaling, tarnishing, or dry corrosion. In this section we will discuss possible mechanisms for this type of corrosion, the types of oxide layers that canform, and the kinetics of oxide formation. Mechanisms As with aqueous corrosion, the process of oxide layer formation is an electrochem-ical one, which may be expressed, for divalent metal M, by the following reaction: 4 (17.28) Furthermore, the above reaction consists of oxidation and reduction half-reactions.The former, with the formation of metal ions, (17.29) M¡ M 2/H11001/H110012e/H11002M/H110011 2 O2¡ MO17.10 Oxidation •651 Zn2+Zn2+Zn2+Zn2+ e– e–e– e–Corrosive environment SteelCathode regionZinc coating (anode)Figure 17.23 Galvanic protection of steel as provided by a coating of zinc.

The reduction half-reaction produces oxygen ions as follows: (17.31) and takes place at the scale–gas interface. A schematic representation of thismetal–scale–gas system is shown in Figure 17.24. For the oxide layer to increase in thickness via Equation 17.28, it is necessary that electrons be conducted to the scale–gas interface, at which point the reductionreaction occurs; in addition, ions must diffuse away from the metal–scale in-terface, and/or ions must diffuse toward this same interface (Figure 17.24). 5 Thus, the oxide scale serves both as an electrolyte through which ions diffuse andas an electrical circuit for the passage of electrons. Furthermore, the scale may pro-tect the metal from rapid oxidation when it acts as a barrier to ionic diffusion and/orelectrical conduction; most metal oxides are highly electrically insulative. Scale Types Rate of oxidation (i.e., the rate of film thickness increase) and the tendency of thefilm to protect the metal from further oxidation are related to the relative volumesof the oxide and metal. The ratio of these volumes, termed the Pilling–Bedworth ratio, may be determined from the following expression: 6 (17.32) P–B ratio /H11005AO rM AM rOO2/H11002M2/H110011 2 O2/H110012e/H11002¡ O2/H11002652 •Chapter 17 / Corrosion and Degradation of Materials Pilling–Bedworth ratioMetal (M)Oxide scale (MO)Gas (O2) M2+ e–O2– M2+ + 2e– O2 + 2e– 1 2M O2–Figure 17.24 Schematic representation of processes that are involved in gaseousoxidation at a metal surface.

If theratio is greater than unity, compressive stresses result in the film as it forms.

it forms. Fora ratio greater than 2–3, the oxide coating may crack and flake off, continuallyexposing a fresh and unprotected metal surface. The ideal P–B ratio for the for-mation of a protective oxide film is unity. Table 17.3 presents P–B ratios for met-als that form protective coatings and for those that do not. Note from these datathat protective coatings normally form for metals having P–B ratios between 1and 2, whereas nonprotective ones usually result when this ratio is less than 1 orgreater than about 2. In addition to the P–B ratio, other factors also influence theoxidation resistance imparted by the film; these include a high degree of adher-ence between film and metal, comparable coefficients of thermal expansion formetal and oxide, and, for the oxide, a relatively high melting point and good high-temperature plasticity. Several techniques are available for improving the oxidation resistance of a metal. One involves application of a protective surface coating of another materialthat adheres well to the metal and also is itself resistant to oxidation. In some in-stances, the addition of alloying elements will form a more adherent and protectiveoxide scale by virtue of producing a more favorable Pilling–Bedworth ratio and/orimproving other scale characteristics. Kinetics One of the primary concerns relative to metal oxidation is the rate at which the re-action progresses. Inasmuch as the oxide scale reaction product normally remainson the surface, the rate of reaction may be determined by measuring the weightgain per unit area as a function of time. When the oxide that forms is nonporous and adheres to the metal surface, the rate of layer growth is controlled by ionic diffusion. A parabolic relationship existsr M rOAM AO17.10 Oxidation •6531496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 653REVISED PAGESTime, tWeight gain per unit area, WLinear Parabolic LogarithmicFigure 17.25 Oxidation film growth curves for linear, parabolic, and logarithmic ratelaws.

The oxidation of iron,copper, and cobalt follows this rate expression. In the oxidation of metals for which the scale is porous or flakes off (i.e., for P–B ratios less than about 1 or greater than about 2), the oxidation rate expressionis linear; that is, (17.35) where is a constant. Under these circumstances oxygen is always available for re-action with an unprotected metal surface because the oxide does not act as a reactionbarrier. Sodium, potassium, and tantalum oxidize according to this rate expressionand, incidentally, have P–B ratios significantly different from unity (Table 17.3). Lineargrowth rate kinetics is also represented in Figure 17.25. Still a third reaction rate law has been observed for very thin oxide layers (gen- erally less than 100 nm) that form at relatively low temperatures. The dependenceof weight gain on time is logarithmic and takes the form (17.36) Again, the K’s are constants. This oxidation behavior, also shown in Figure 17.25, has been observed for aluminum, iron, and copper at near-ambient temperatures. Corrosion of Ceramic Materials Ceramic materials, being compounds between metallic and nonmetallic elements,may be thought of as having already been corroded. Thus, they are exceedinglyimmune to corrosion by almost all environments, especially at room tempera-ture. Corrosion of ceramic materials generally involves simple chemical dissolu-tion, in contrast to the electrochemical processes found in metals, as describedabove.W/H11005K 4 log1K5t/H11001K62K3W/H11005K3tK2 K1W 2/H11005K1t/H11001K2654 •Chapter 17 / Corrosion and Degradation of Materials Parabolic rate expression formetal oxidation—dependence ofweight gain (per unitarea) on time Linear rate expression for metaloxidation Logarithmic rate expression for metaloxidation1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 654REVISED PAGESCeramic materials are frequently utilized because of their resistance to corrosion.

to corrosion. Glass is often used to contain liquids for this reason. Refractory ceramics must not only withstand high temperatures and provide thermal insulation but, in many in-stances, must also resist high-temperature attack by molten metals, salts, slags, andglasses. Some of the new technology schemes for converting energy from one form toanother that is more useful require relatively high temperatures,corrosive atmospheres,and pressures above the ambient. Ceramic materials are much better suited to with-stand most of these environments for reasonable time periods than are metals. Degradation of Polymers Polymeric materials also experience deterioration by means of environmental in-teractions. However, an undesirable interaction is specified as degradation ratherthan corrosion because the processes are basically dissimilar.Whereas most metalliccorrosion reactions are electrochemical, by contrast, polymeric degradation is phys-iochemical; that is, it involves physical as well as chemical phenomena. Furthermore,a wide variety of reactions and adverse consequences are possible for polymerdegradation. Polymers may deteriorate by swelling and dissolution. Covalent bondrupture, as a result of heat energy, chemical reactions, and radiation is also possi-ble, ordinarily with an attendant reduction in mechanical integrity. It should also bementioned that because of the chemical complexity of polymers, their degradationmechanisms are not well understood. To briefly cite a couple of examples of polymer degradation, polyethylene, if ex- posed to high temperatures in an oxygen atmosphere, suffers an impairment of itsmechanical properties by becoming brittle. Also, the utility of poly(vinyl chloride)may be limited because this material may become colored when exposed to high tem-peratures, although such environments do not affect its mechanical characteristics. 17.11 SWELLING AND DISSOLUTION When polymers are exposed to liquids, the main forms of degradation are swellingand dissolution. With swelling, the liquid or solute diffuses into and is absorbedwithin the polymer; the small solute molecules fit into and occupy positions amongthe polymer molecules.

polymer molecules. Thus the macromolecules are forced apart such that thespecimen expands or swells. Furthermore, this increase in chain separation resultsin a reduction of the secondary intermolecular bonding forces; as a consequence,the material becomes softer and more ductile.The liquid solute also lowers the glasstransition temperature and, if depressed below the ambient temperature, will causea once strong material to become rubbery and weak. Swelling may be considered to be a partial dissolution process in which there is only limited solubility of the polymer in the solvent. Dissolution, which occurswhen the polymer is completely soluble, may be thought of as just a continuationof swelling. As a rule of thumb, the greater the similarity of chemical structurebetween the solvent and polymer, the greater is the likelihood of swelling and/ordissolution. For example, many hydrocarbon rubbers readily absorb hydrocarbonliquids such as gasoline. The responses of selected polymeric materials to organicsolvents are contained in Tables 17.4 and 17.5. Swelling and dissolution traits also are affected by temperature as well as char- acteristics of the molecular structure. In general, increasing molecular weight, increas-ing degree of crosslinking and crystallinity, and decreasing temperature result in areduction of these deteriorative processes.17.11 Swelling and Dissolution •655 1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 655REVISED PAGESTable 17.4 Resistance to Degradation by Various Environments for Selected Plastic Materialsa Aqueous Nonoxidizing Oxidizing Salt Aqueous Polar Nonpolar Acids Acids Solutions Alkalis Solvents Solvents Material (20% H 2SO 4)( 10% HNO 3)( NaCl)( NaOH)( C2H5OH)( C6H6) Water Polytetrafluoro- ethylene S S S S S S S Nylon 6,6 U U S S Q S S Polycarbonate Q U S U S U S Polyester Q Q S Q Q U S Polyetherether- ketone S S S S S S S Low-density polyethylene S Q S — S Q S High-density polyethylene S Q S — S Q S Poly(ethylene terephthalate) S Q S S S S S Poly(phenylene oxide) S Q S S S U S Polypropylene S Q S S S Q S Polystyrene S Q S S S U S Polyurethane Q U S Q U Q S Epoxy S U S S S S S Silicone Q U S S S Q S aS/H11005 satisfactory; Q /H11005 questionable; U /H11005 unsatisfactory.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 17.12 BOND RUPTURE Polymers may also experience degradation by a process termed scission—the sev- erence or rupture of molecular chain bonds. This causes a separation of chain seg-ments at the point of scission and a reduction in the molecular weight.As previouslydiscussed (Chapter 15), several properties of polymeric materials, including me-chanical strength and resistance to chemical attack, depend on molecular weight.Consequently, some of the physical and chemical properties of polymers may beadversely affected by this form of degradation. Bond rupture may result fromexposure to radiation or to heat, and from chemical reaction. Radiation Effects Certain types of radiation [electron beams, x-rays, - and -rays, and ultraviolet (UV)radiation] possess sufficient energy to penetrate a polymer specimen and interact withthe constituent atoms or their electrons. One such reaction is ionization, in which the radiation removes an orbital electron from a specific atom, converting that atom intoa positively charged ion. As a consequence, one of the covalent bonds associated withthe specific atom is broken, and there is a rearrangement of atoms or groups of atomsat that point.

that point. This bond breaking leads to either scission or crosslinking at the ion-ization site, depending on the chemical structure of the polymer and also on the doseof radiation. Stabilizers (Section 15.21) may be added to protect polymers from ra-diation damage. In day-to-day use, the greatest radiation damage to polymers is causedby UV irradiation. After prolonged exposure, most polymer films become brittle, dis-color, crack, and fail. For example, camping tents begin to tear, dashboards developcracks, and plastic windows become cloudy. Radiation problems are more severe forsome applications. Polymers on space vehicles must resist degradation after prolongedexposures to cosmic radiation. Similarly, polymers used in nuclear reactors must with-stand high levels of nuclear radiation. Developing polymeric materials that can with-stand these extreme environments is a continuing challenge. Not all consequences of radiation exposure are deleterious. Crosslinking may be induced by irradiation to improve the mechanical behavior and degradation char-acteristics. For example, -radiation is used commercially to crosslink polyethyleneto enhance its resistance to softening and flow at elevated temperatures; indeed,this process may be carried out on products that have already been fabricated. Chemical Reaction Effects Oxygen, ozone, and other substances can cause or accelerate chain scission as a re-sult of chemical reaction. This effect is especially prevalent in vulcanized rubbersthat have doubly bonded carbon atoms along the backbone molecular chains, andthat are exposed to ozone (O 3), an atmospheric pollutant. One such scission reac- tion may be represented by (17.37) + C O3 R HOO C R R′ +O· R′ HC HC H+gg b17.12 Bond Rupture •657 scission1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 657REVISED PAGESwhere the chain is severed at the point of the double bond; R and represent groups of atoms that are unaffected during the reaction.

the reaction. Ordinarily, if the rubber is in an un-stressed state, a film will form on the surface, protecting the bulk material from anyfurther reaction. However, when these materials are subjected to tensile stresses, cracksand crevices form and grow in a direction perpendicular to the stress; eventually,rupture of the material may occur. This is why the sidewalls on rubber bicycle tiresdevelop cracks as they age. Apparently these cracks result from large numbers ofozone-induced scissions. Chemical degradation is a particular problem for polymersused in areas with high levels of air pollutants such as smog and ozone. The elastomersin Table 17.5 are rated as to their resistance to degradation by exposure to ozone. Manyof these chain scission reactions involve reactive groups termed free radicals. Stabiliz- ers (Section 15.21) may be added to protect polymers from oxidation. The stabilizerseither sacrificially react with the ozone to consume it, or they react with and eliminatethe free radicals before they (the free radicals) can inflict more damage. Thermal Effects Thermal degradation corresponds to the scission of molecular chains at elevatedtemperatures; as a consequence, some polymers undergo chemical reactions in whichgaseous species are produced. These reactions are evidenced by a weight loss of ma-terial; a polymer’s thermal stability is a measure of its resilience to this decomposi-tion. Thermal stability is related primarily to the magnitude of the bonding energiesbetween the various atomic constituents of the polymer: higher bonding energies re-sult in more thermally stable materials. For example, the magnitude of the bond is greater than that of the bond, which in turn is greater than that ofthe bond. The fluorocarbons, having bonds, are among the most ther-mally resistant polymeric materials and may be utilized at relatively high tempera-tures. However, due to the weak bond, when poly(vinyl chloride) is heatedto for even a few minutes it will discolor and give off large amounts of HClthat accelerates continued decomposition.

continued decomposition. Stabilizers (Section 15.21) such as ZnOcan react with the HCl, providing increased thermal stability for poly(vinyl chloride). Some of the most thermally stable polymers are the ladder polymers. 7For example, the ladder polymer having the following structure200/H11034CC¬ClC¬F C¬ClC¬HC¬FR¿658 •Chapter 17 / Corrosion and Degradation of Materials 7The chain structure of a “ladder polymer” consists of two sets of covalent bonds throughout its length that are crosslinked.is so thermally stable that a woven cloth of this material can be heated directly inan open flame with no degradation. Polymers of this type are used in place ofasbestos for high-temperature gloves. 17.13 WEATHERING Many polymeric materials serve in applications that require exposure to outdoorconditions. Any resultant degradation is termed weathering, which may, in fact, be a combination of several different processes. Under these conditions deteriorationC NH C NC CH C NC CH C CRepeat unit1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 658REVISED PAGESis primarily a result of oxidation, which is initiated by ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Some polymers such as nylon and cellulose are also susceptible to waterabsorption, which produces a reduction in their hardness and stiffness. Resistanceto weathering among the various polymers is quite diverse. The fluorocarbons arevirtually inert under these conditions; but some materials, including poly(vinylchloride) and polystyrene, are susceptible to weathering.

Companion Site).] SUMMARY Electrochemical ConsiderationsMetallic corrosion is ordinarily electrochemical, involving both oxidation and re- duction reactions. Oxidation is the loss of the metal atom’s valence electrons; theresulting metal ions may either go into the corroding solution or form an insolublecompound. During reduction, these electrons are transferred to at least one otherchemical species. The character of the corrosion environment dictates which of sev-eral possible reduction reactions will occur. Not all metals oxidize with the same degree of ease, which is demonstrated with a galvanic couple; when in an electrolyte, one metal (the anode) will corrode,whereas a reduction reaction will occur at the other metal (the cathode). The mag-nitude of the electric potential that is established between anode and cathode isindicative of the driving force for the corrosion reaction. The standard emf and galvanic series are simply rankings of metallic materials on the basis of their tendency to corrode when coupled to other metals. For the standardemf series, ranking is based on the magnitude of the voltage generated when the stan-dard cell of a metal is coupled to the standard hydrogen electrode at The galvanic series consists of the relative reactivities of metals and alloys in seawater. The half-cell potentials in the standard emf series are thermodynamic param- eters that are valid only at equilibrium; corroding systems are not in equilibrium.Furthermore, the magnitudes of these potentials provide no indication as to therates at which corrosion reactions occur. Corrosion RatesThe rate of corrosion may be expressed as corrosion penetration rate, that is, the thickness loss of material per unit of time. Mils per year and millimeters per yearare the common units for this parameter. Alternatively, rate is proportional to thecurrent density associated with the electrochemical reaction. Prediction of Corrosion RatesCorroding systems will experience polarization, which is the displacement of each electrode potential from its equilibrium value; the magnitude of the displacementis termed the overvoltage.

the overvoltage. The corrosion rate of a reaction is limited by polariza-tion, of which there are two types—activation and concentration. Polarization data25/H11034C (77/H11034F).Summary •659 Case Study: “Artificial Total HipReplacement,” Chap-ter 22, which may befound at www.wiley.com/college/callister(Student CompanionSite)1496T_c17_621-664 12/31/05 14:10 Page 6592nd REVISE PAGESare plotted as potential versus the logarithm of current density. The corrosion rate for a particular reaction may be computed using the current density associated withthe intersection point of oxidation and reduction polarization curves. Passivity A number of metals and alloys passivate, or lose their chemical reactivity, under some environmental circumstances. This phenomenon is thought to involve the for-mation of a thin protective oxide film. Stainless steels and aluminum alloys exhibitthis type of behavior. The active-to-passive behavior may be explained by the al-loy’s S-shaped electrochemical potential-versus-log current density curve. Intersec-tions with reduction polarization curves in active and passive regions correspond,respectively, to high and low corrosion rates. Forms of Corrosion Metallic corrosion is sometimes classified into eight different forms: uniform attack, galvanic corrosion, crevice corrosion, pitting, intergranular corrosion, selectiveleaching, erosion–corrosion, and stress corrosion. Hydrogen embrittlement, a typeof failure sometimes observed in corrosion environments, was also discussed. Corrosion Prevention The measures that may be taken to prevent, or at least reduce, corrosion include material selection, environmental alteration, the use of inhibitors, design changes,application of coatings, and cathodic protection. Oxidation Oxidation of metallic materials by electrochemical action is also possible in dry, gaseous atmospheres.

gaseous atmospheres. An oxide film forms on the surface which may act as a bar-rier to further oxidation if the volumes of metal and oxide film are similar, that is,if the Pilling–Bedworth ratio is near unity. The kinetics of film formation may fol-low parabolic, linear, or logarithmic rate laws. Corrosion of Ceramic Materials Ceramic materials, being inherently corrosion resistant, are frequently utilized at elevated temperatures and/or in extremely corrosive environments. Swelling and Dissolution Bond RuptureWeathering Polymeric materials deteriorate by noncorrosive processes. Upon exposure to liq- uids, they may experience degradation by swelling or dissolution. With swelling,solute molecules actually fit into the molecular structure. Scission, or the severanceof molecular chain bonds, may be induced by radiation, chemical reactions, or heat.This results in a reduction of molecular weight and a deterioration of the physicaland chemical properties of the polymer.660 •Chapter 17 / Corrosion and Degradation of Materials IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS Activation polarizationAnodeCathodeCathodic protectionConcentration polarizationCorrosionCorrosion penetration rateCrevice corrosionDegradationElectrolyteElectromotive force (emf) seriesErosion–corrosion1496T_c17_621-664 12/14/05 8:54 Page 660REVISED PAGESQuestions and Problems •661 Galvanic corrosion Galvanic seriesHydrogen embrittlementInhibitorIntergranular corrosionMolarityOxidationPassivityPilling–Bedworth ratioPittingPolarizationReductionSacrificial anodeScissionSelective leachingStandard half-cellStress corrosionWeld decay REFERENCES ASM Handbook, Vol. 13, Corrosion, ASM Inter- national, Materials Park, OH, 1987.

Consideration of the electrical properties of materials is often important when materials selection and pro-cessing decisions are being made during the design ofa component or structure. For example, we discuss inSections 22.15 through 22.20 materials that are usedin the several components of one type of integratedcircuit package. The electrical behaviors of the variousmaterials are diverse. Some need to be highly electri-cally conductive (e.g., connecting wires), whereaselectrical insulativity is required of others (e.g., theprotective package encapsulation). WHY STUDY the Electrical Properties of Materials? 1496T_c18_665-721 12/21/05 12:53 Page 665REVISED PAGES18.1 INTRODUCTION The prime objective of this chapter is to explore the electrical properties of materials, that is, their responses to an applied electric field. We begin with the phenomenon ofelectrical conduction: the parameters by which it is expressed, the mechanism of con-duction by electrons, and how the electron energy band structure of a material influ-ences its ability to conduct. These principles are extended to metals, semiconductors,and insulators. Particular attention is given to the characteristics of semiconductorsand then to semiconducting devices. Also treated are the dielectric characteristics ofinsulating materials. The final sections are devoted to the peculiar phenomena offerroelectricity and piezoelectricity.

and piezoelectricity. Electrical Conduction 18.2 OHM’S LAW One of the most important electrical characteristics of a solid material is the easewith which it transmits an electric current. Ohm’s law relates the current I—or time rate of charge passage—to the applied voltage Vas follows: (18.1) where Ris the resistance of the material through which the current is passing. The units for V, I, and Rare, respectively, volts (J/C), amperes (C/s), and ohms (V/A). The value of Ris influenced by specimen configuration, and for many materials is independent of current. The resistivity is independent of specimen geometry but related to R through the expression (18.2) r/H11005RA lrV/H11005IRLearning Objectives After careful study of this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1.Describe the four possible electron band struc-tures for solid materials. 2.Briefly describe electron excitation events thatproduce free electrons/holes in (a) metals, (b)semiconductors (intrinsic and extrinsic), and(c) insulators. 3.Calculate the electrical conductivities of met-als, semiconductors (intrinsic and extrinsic),and insulators given their charge carrier den-sity(s) and mobility(s). 4.Distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic semiconducting materials. 5.

In fact, one way of classifying solid materials is according to the ease with which they conduct an electric current; within this classification schemethere are three groupings: conductors, semiconductors, and insulators. Metals are good conductors, typically having conductivities on the order of ( -m) At theother extreme are materials with very low conductivities, ranging between and ( -m) these are electrical insulators. Materials with intermediate conduc- tivities, generally from to ( -m) are termed semiconductors. Electrical conductivity ranges for the various material types are compared in the bar-chart ofFigure 1.7. 18.4 ELECTRONIC AND IONIC CONDUCTION An electric current results from the motion of electrically charged particles in re-sponse to forces that act on them from an externally applied electric field. Posi-tively charged particles are accelerated in the field direction, negatively chargedparticles in the direction opposite.

direction opposite. Within most solid materials a current arises fromthe flow of electrons, which is termed electronic conduction. In addition, for ionic materials a net motion of charged ions is possible that produces a current; such istermed ionic conduction. The present discussion deals with electronic conduction; ionic conduction is treated briefly in Section 18.16. 18.5 ENERGY BAND STRUCTURES IN SOLIDS In all conductors, semiconductors, and many insulating materials, only electronicconduction exists, and the magnitude of the electrical conductivity is strongly de-pendent on the number of electrons available to participate in the conductionprocess. However, not all electrons in every atom will accelerate in the presence ofan electric field. The number of electrons available for electrical conduction in aparticular material is related to the arrangement of electron states or levels withrespect to energy, and then the manner in which these states are occupied by elec-trons. A thorough exploration of these topics is complicated and involves principlesof quantum mechanics that are beyond the scope of this book; the ensuing devel-opment omits some concepts and simplifies others. Concepts relating to electron energy states, their occupancy, and the resulting electron configuration for isolated atoms were discussed in Section 2.3. By way ofreview, for each individual atom there exist discrete energy levels that may be oc-cupied by electrons, arranged into shells and subshells. Shells are designated by in-tegers (1, 2, 3, etc. ), and subshells by letters ( s,p,d, and f). For each of s, p,d, and fsubshells, there exist, respectively, one, three, five, and seven states. The electrons in most atoms fill only the states having the lowest energies, two electrons of op-posite spin per state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle. The electronconfiguration of an isolated atom represents the arrangement of the electrons withinthe allowed states.

allowed states. Let us now make an extrapolation of some of these concepts to solid materi- als. A solid may be thought of as consisting of a large number, say, N, of atoms ini- tially separated from one another, which are subsequently brought together andbonded to form the ordered atomic arrangement found in the crystalline material.At relatively large separation distances, each atom is independent of all the othersand will have the atomic energy levels and electron configuration as if isolated.However, as the atoms come within close proximity of one another, electrons areacted upon, or perturbed, by the electrons and nuclei of adjacent atoms. This in-fluence is such that each distinct atomic state may split into a series of closely spaced/H110021, /H9024 10410/H110026/H110021; /H9024 10/H110022010/H1100210/H110021. /H9024 107668 •Chapter 18 / Electrical Properties metal insulator semiconductor ionic conduction1496T_c18_665-721 12/21/05 12:53 Page 668REVISED PAGESFigure 18.2 Schematic plot of electron energy versus interatomic separation for an aggregate of 12 atoms Upon close approach, each of the 1s and 2s atomic states splits to form an electron energy band consisting of 12 states.(N/H1100512).

electron occupancy. The conventional way of representing electron bandstructures in solids is shown in Figure 18.3 a. The number of states within each band will equal the total of all states con- tributed by the N atoms. For example, an sband will consist of N states, and a p band of 3N states. With regard to occupancy, each energy state may accommodate two electrons, which must have oppositely directed spins. Furthermore, bands willcontain the electrons that resided in the corresponding levels of the isolated atoms;for example, a 4 senergy band in the solid will contain those isolated atom’s 4 selec- trons. Of course, there will be empty bands and, possibly, bands that are only par-tially filled. The electrical properties of a solid material are a consequence of its electron band structure—that is, the arrangement of the outermost electron bands and theway in which they are filled with electrons. Four different types of band structures are possible at 0 K. In the first (Figure 18.4a), one outermost band is only partially filled with electrons. The energy cor-responding to the highest filled state at 0 K is called the Fermi energy as indi- cated. This energy band structure is typified by some metals, in particular those thathave a single svalence electron (e.g., copper). Each copper atom has one 4 selectron; however, for a solid comprised of N atoms, the 4 sband is capable of accommodating 2Nelectrons. Thus only half the available electron positions within this 4 sband are filled. For the second band structure, also found in metals (Figure 18.4 b), there is an overlap of an empty band and a filled band. Magnesium has this band struc-ture. Each isolated Mg atom has two 3 selectrons. However, when a solid is formed, the 3s and 3p bands overlap. In this instance and at 0 K, the Fermi energy is taken as that energy below which, for N atoms, Nstates are filled, two electrons per state.

per state. The final two band structures are similar; one band (the valence band ) that is completely filled with electrons is separated from an empty conduction band, andE f,670 •Chapter 18 / Electrical Properties Fermi energy valence band conduction band1496T_c18_665-721 12/21/05 12:53 Page 670REVISED PAGESFigure 18.5 For a metal, occupancy of electron states (a) before and (b) after an electron excitation. (b) (a)EfEmpty states Electron excitation Filled statesEnergyEfan energy band gap lies between them. For very pure materials, electrons may not have energies within this gap. The difference between the two band structures lies in the magnitude of the energy gap; for materials that are insulators, the band gapis relatively wide (Figure 18.4 c), whereas for semiconductors it is narrow (Fig- ure 18.4d). The Fermi energy for these two band structures lies within the bandgap—near its center. 18.6 CONDUCTION IN TERMS OF BAND AND ATOMIC BONDING MODELS At this point in the discussion, it is vital that another concept be understood—namely, that only electrons with energies greater than the Fermi energy may beacted on and accelerated in the presence of an electric field. These are the electronsthat participate in the conduction process, which are termed free electrons. Another charged electronic entity called a hole is found in semiconductors and insulators. Holes have energies less than and also participate in electronic conduction. Asthe ensuing discussion reveals, the electrical conductivity is a direct function of thenumbers of free electrons and holes. In addition, the distinction between conduc-tors and nonconductors (insulators and semiconductors) lies in the numbers of thesefree electron and hole charge carriers. Metals For an electron to become free, it must be excited or promoted into one of theempty and available energy states above For metals having either of the bandstructures shown in Figures 18.4 aand 18.4b, there are vacant energy states adjacent to the highest filled state at Thus, very little energy is required to promote elec-trons into the low-lying empty states, as shown in Figure 18.5.

Figure 18.5. Generally, the energyprovided by an electric field is sufficient to excite large numbers of electrons intothese conducting states. For the metallic bonding model discussed in Section 2.6, it was assumed that all the valence electrons have freedom of motion and form an “electron gas,” whichis uniformly distributed throughout the lattice of ion cores.Although these electronsare not locally bound to any particular atom, nevertheless, they must experiencesome excitation to become conducting electrons that are truly free. Thus, althoughE f.Ef.Ef18.6 Conduction in Terms of Band and Atomic Bonding Models •671 free electron holeenergy band gap1496T_c18_665-721 12/21/05 12:53 Page 671REVISED PAGESonly a fraction are excited, this still gives rise to a relatively large number of free electrons and, consequently, a high conductivity. Insulators and Semiconductors For insulators and semiconductors, empty states adjacent to the top of the filled va-lence band are not available.To become free, therefore, electrons must be promotedacross the energy band gap and into empty states at the bottom of the conductionband. This is possible only by supplying to an electron the difference in energy be-tween these two states, which is approximately equal to the band gap energy This excitation process is demonstrated in Figure 18.6. 1For many materials this band gap is several electron volts wide. Most often the excitation energy is from anonelectrical source such as heat or light, usually the former. The number of electrons excited thermally (by heat energy) into the conduc- tion band depends on the energy band gap width as well as temperature. At a giventemperature, the larger the the lower is the probability that a valence electronwill be promoted into an energy state within the conduction band; this results infewer conduction electrons.

conduction electrons. In other words, the larger the band gap, the lower is theelectrical conductivity at a given temperature. Thus, the distinction between semi-conductors and insulators lies in the width of the band gap; for semiconductors itis narrow, whereas for insulating materials it is relatively wide. Increasing the temperature of either a semiconductor or an insulator results in an increase in the thermal energy that is available for electron excitation.Thus, moreelectrons are promoted into the conduction band, which gives rise to an enhancedconductivity. The conductivity of insulators and semiconductors may also be viewed from the perspective of atomic bonding models discussed in Section 2.6. For electricallyinsulating materials, interatomic bonding is ionic or strongly covalent. Thus, thevalence electrons are tightly bound to or shared with the individual atoms. In otherwords, these electrons are highly localized and are not in any sense free to wanderthroughout the crystal.The bonding in semiconductors is covalent (or predominantlyE g,Eg.672 •Chapter 18 / Electrical Properties (a)Conduction bandValence bandBand gap Band gapFree electron Electron excitation Hole in valence bandEnergyEg (b)Conduction bandValence bandFigure 18.6 For an insulator or semiconductor, occupancy of electron states (a) before and (b) after an electron excitation from the valence band into the conduction band, in which both a free electron and a hole are generated. 1The magnitudes of the band gap energy and the energies between adjacent levels in both the valence and conduction bands of Figure 18.6 are not to scale.

the atoms. Consequently, these electrons are more easily removedby thermal excitation than they are for insulators. 18.7 ELECTRON MOBILITY When an electric field is applied, a force is brought to bear on the free electrons;as a consequence, they all experience an acceleration in a direction opposite to thatof the field, by virtue of their negative charge. According to quantum mechanics,there is no interaction between an accelerating electron and atoms in a perfectcrystal lattice. Under such circumstances all the free electrons should accelerate aslong as the electric field is applied, which would give rise to an electric current thatis continuously increasing with time. However, we know that a current reaches aconstant value the instant that a field is applied, indicating that there exist whatmight be termed “frictional forces,” which counter this acceleration from theexternal field. These frictional forces result from the scattering of electrons by im-perfections in the crystal lattice, including impurity atoms, vacancies, interstitialatoms, dislocations, and even the thermal vibrations of the atoms themselves. Eachscattering event causes an electron to lose kinetic energy and to change its direc-tion of motion, as represented schematically in Figure 18.7. There is, however, somenet electron motion in the direction opposite to the field, and this flow of charge isthe electric current. The scattering phenomenon is manifested as a resistance to the passage of an electric current. Several parameters are used to describe the extent of thisscattering; these include the drift velocity and the mobility of an electron. The drift velocity represents the average electron velocity in the direction of theforce imposed by the applied field. It is directly proportional to the electric fieldas follows: (18.7) The constant of proportionality is called the electron mobility, which is an indication of the frequency of scattering events; its units are square meters pervolt-second (m 2/V-s). The conductivity of most materials may be expressed as (18.8) s/H11005n0e0mesmevd/H11005me evd18.7 Electron Mobility •673 mobility Electron drift velocity—dependence onelectron mobilityand electric fieldintensity Electrical conductivity—dependenceon electronconcentration,charge, and mobility Figure 18.7 Schematic diagram showing the path of an electron that is deflected by scattering events.

Will the electri-cal conductivity of the noncrystalline metal be greater or less than its crystallinecounterpart? Why? [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 18.8 ELECTRICAL RESISTIVITY OF METALS As mentioned previously, most metals are extremely good conductors of electricity;room-temperature conductivities for several of the more common metals are con-tained in Table 18.1. (Table B.9 in Appendix B lists the electrical resistivities of alarge number of metals and alloys.) Again, metals have high conductivities becauseof the large numbers of free electrons that have been excited into empty statesabove the Fermi energy. Thus nhas a large value in the conductivity expression, Equation 18.8. At this point it is convenient to discuss conduction in metals in terms of the resistivity, the reciprocal of conductivity; the reason for this switch in topic shouldbecome apparent in the ensuing discussion. Since crystalline defects serve as scattering centers for conduction electrons in metals, increasing their number raises the resistivity (or lowers the conductivity).The concentration of these imperfections depends on temperature, composition,and the degree of cold work of a metal specimen.

In fact, it has been observedexperimentally that the total resistivity of a metal is the sum of the contributionsfrom thermal vibrations, impurities, and plastic deformation; that is, the scattering1.6/H1100310 /H1100219 C).0e0674 •Chapter 18 / Electrical Properties Table 18.1 Room-Temperature Electrical Conductivities for Nine Common Metals and Alloys Electrical Conductivity Metal [(/H9024-m)/H115461] Silver 6.8 /H11003107 Copper 6.0 /H11003107 Gold 4.3 /H11003107 Aluminum 3.8 /H11003107 Brass (70Cu–30Zn) 1.6 /H11003107 Iron 1.0 /H11003107 Platinum 0.94 /H11003107 Plain carbon steel 0.6 /H11003107 Stainless steel 0.2 /H110031071496T_c18_665-721 12/21/05 12:53 Page 674REVISED PAGESmechanisms act independently of one another.

The influence of nickel impurity additions on the room- temperature resistivity of copper is demonstrated in Figure 18.9, up to 50 wt% Ni;over this composition range nickel is completely soluble in copper (Figure 9.3 a). Again, nickel atoms in copper act as scattering centers, and increasing the concen-tration of nickel in copper results in an enhancement of resistivity. For a two-phase alloy consisting of and phases, a rule-of-mixtures expression may be utilized to approximate the resistivity as follows: (18.12) where the V’s and ’s represent volume fractions and individual resistivities for the respective phases. Influence of Plastic Deformation Plastic deformation also raises the electrical resistivity as a result of increased num-bers of electron-scattering dislocations.

commercial buildings. How- ever, between 1965 and 1973 the price of copperincreased significantly, and, consequently alu-minum wiring was installed in many buildings con-structed or remodeled during this period becausealuminum was a less expensive electrical conduc-tor.An inordinately high number of fires occurredin these buildings, and investigations revealed thatthe use of aluminum posed an increased firehazard risk over copper wiring. When properly installed, aluminum wiring can be just as safe as copper. These safety problemsarose at connection points between the aluminumand copper; copper wiring was used for connec-tion terminals on electrical equipment (circuitbreakers, receptacles, switches, etc.) to which thealuminum wiring was attached. As electrical circuits are turned on and off, the electrical wiring heats up and then cools down.This thermal cycling causes the wires to alternatelyexpand and contract. The amounts of expansionand contraction for the aluminum are greater thanfor copper—i.e., aluminum has a higher coefficientof thermal expansion than copper (Section 19.3). 2 Consequently, these differences in expansion andcontraction between the aluminum and copperwires can cause the connections to loosen.Anotherfactor that contributes to the loosening of copper-aluminum wire connections is creep (Section8.12); mechanical stresses exist at these wire con-nections, and aluminum is more susceptible tocreep deformation at or near room temperaturethan copper. This loosening of the connectionscompromises the electrical wire-to-wire contact,which increases the electrical resistance at the con-nection and leads to increased heating. Aluminumoxidizes more readily than copper, and this oxidecoating further increases the electrical resistanceat the connection. Ultimately, a connection maydeteriorate to the point that electrical arcingand/or heat build up can ignite any combustiblematerials in the vicinity of the junction.

used metallicconductor. Oxygen-free high-conductivity (OFHC) copper, having extremely lowoxygen and other impurity contents, is produced for many electrical applications.Aluminum, having a conductivity only about one-half that of copper, is alsofrequently used as an electrical conductor. Silver has a higher conductivity thaneither copper or aluminum; however, its use is restricted on the basis of cost. On occasion, it is necessary to improve the mechanical strength of a metal alloy without impairing significantly its electrical conductivity. Both solid-solution alloy-ing (Section 7.9) and cold working (Section 7.10) improve strength at the expenseof conductivity, and thus, a tradeoff must be made for these two properties. Mostoften, strength is enhanced by introducing a second phase that does not have soadverse an effect on conductivity. For example, copper–beryllium alloys areprecipitation hardened (Section 11.9); but even so, the conductivity is reduced byabout a factor of 5 over high-purity copper. For some applications, such as furnace heating elements, a high electrical resistivity is desirable. The energy loss by electrons that are scattered is dissipated asheat energy. Such materials must have not only a high resistivity, but also a resistanceto oxidation at elevated temperatures and, of course, a high melting temperature.Nichrome, a nickel–chromium alloy, is commonly employed in heating elements.1496T_c18_665-721 12/21/05 12:53 Page 677REVISED PAGES678 •Chapter 18 / Electrical Properties tions are concealed, these materials may smolder or a fire may spread undetected for an extendedperiod of time.

apparent reason. There are several options available for making buildings wired with aluminum safe. 3The most obvious (and also most expensive) is to replace allof the aluminum wires with copper. The next bestoption is the installation of a crimp connector repairunit at each aluminum-copper connection.With thistechnique, a piece of copper wire is attached to theexisting aluminum wire branch using a specially de-signed metal sleeve and powered crimping tool; themetal sleeve is called a “COPALUM parallel spliceconnector.” The crimping tool essentially makes acold weld between the two wires. Finally, the con-nection is encased in an insulating sleeve. Aschematic representation of a COPALUM device isshown in Figure 18.10. Only qualified and speciallytrained electricians are allowed to install theseCOPALUM connectors. Two other less-desirable options are CO/ALR devices and pigtailing.

When the electrical characteristics aredictated by impurity atoms, the semiconductor is said to be extrinsic. 18.10 INTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTION Intrinsic semiconductors are characterized by the electron band structure shown inFigure 18.4d: at 0 K, a completely filled valence band, separated from an empty con-duction band by a relatively narrow forbidden band gap, generally less than 2 eV .The two elemental semiconductors are silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge), havingband gap energies of approximately 1.1 and 0.7 eV , respectively. Both are found inGroup IVA of the periodic table (Figure 2.6) and are covalently bonded. 4In addi- tion, a host of compound semiconducting materials also display intrinsic behavior.One such group is formed between elements of Groups IIIA and VA, for example,gallium arsenide (GaAs) and indium antimonide (InSb); these are frequently calledIII–V compounds. The compounds composed of elements of Groups IIB and VIAalso display semiconducting behavior; these include cadmium sulfide (CdS) and zinctelluride (ZnTe). As the two elements forming these compounds become morewidely separated with respect to their relative positions in the periodic table (i.e.,the electronegativities become more dissimilar, Figure 2.7), the atomic bondingbecomes more ionic and the magnitude of the band gap energy increases—thematerials tend to become more insulative.

In metals, electron transitions normally occur from empty tofilled states within the same band (Figure 18.5), without the creation of holes.sp 31496T_c18_665-721 12/21/05 12:53 Page 679REVISED PAGESinfluence of an electric field, the position of this missing electron within the crystalline lattice may be thought of as moving by the motion of other valence electrons thatrepeatedly fill in the incomplete bond (Figure 18.11).This process is expedited by treat-ing a missing electron from the valence band as a positively charged particle calledahole. A hole is considered to have a charge that is of the same magnitude as that for an electron, but of opposite sign ( ). Thus, in the presence of an electric field, excited electrons and holes move in opposite directions. Furthermore,in semiconductors both electrons and holes are scattered by lattice imperfections. Intrinsic Conductivity Since there are two types of charge carrier (free electrons and holes) in an intrinsicsemiconductor, the expression for electrical conduction, Equation 18.8, must bemodified to include a term to account for the contribution of the hole current.Therefore, we write (18.13) where pis the number of holes per cubic meter and is the hole mobility.

For example, an impurity concentration of oneatom in 10 12is sufficient to render silicon extrinsic at room temperature. n-Type Extrinsic Semiconduction To illustrate how extrinsic semiconduction is accomplished, consider again theelemental semiconductor silicon. An Si atom has four electrons, each of which iscovalently bonded with one of four adjacent Si atoms. Now, suppose that an impu-rity atom with a valence of 5 is added as a substitutional impurity; possibilities wouldinclude atoms from the Group VA column of the periodic table (e.g., P , As, and Sb).Only four of five valence electrons of these impurity atoms can participate in thebonding because there are only four possible bonds with neighboring atoms. Theextra nonbonding electron is loosely bound to the region around the impurity atomby a weak electrostatic attraction, as illustrated in Figure 18.12 a. The binding en- ergy of this electron is relatively small (on the order of 0.01 eV); thus, it is easilyremoved from the impurity atom, in which case it becomes a free or conductingelectron (Figures 18.12 band 18.12c).

band 18.12c). The energy state of such an electron may be viewed from the perspective of the electron band model scheme. For each of the loosely bound electrons, there ex-ists a single energy level, or energy state, which is located within the forbidden bandgap just below the bottom of the conduction band (Figure 18.13 a). The electron binding energy corresponds to the energy required to excite the electron from oneof these impurity states to a state within the conduction band. Each excitation event(Figure 18.13b) supplies or donates a single electron to the conduction band; animpurity of this type is aptly termed a donor. Since each donor electron is excited from an impurity level, no corresponding hole is created within the valence band. At room temperature, the thermal energy available is sufficient to excite large numbers of electrons from donor states; in addition, some intrinsic valence–conduction band transitions occur, as in Figure 18.6 b, but to a negligible degree. Thus, the number donor state1496T_c18_665-721 12/21/05 12:53 Page 682REVISED PAGESof electrons in the conduction band far exceeds the number of holes in the valence band (or ), and the first term on the right-hand side of Equation 18.13 over-whelms the second; that is, (18.16) A material of this type is said to be an n-type extrinsic semiconductor.

One of the covalent bonds around each of these atoms is de-ficient in an electron; such a deficiency may be viewed as a hole that is weaklybound to the impurity atom. This hole may be liberated from the impurity atom bythe transfer of an electron from an adjacent bond as illustrated in Figure 18.14. Inessence, the electron and the hole exchange positions. A moving hole is consideredto be in an excited state and participates in the conduction process, in a manneranalogous to an excited donor electron, as described above. Extrinsic excitations, in which holes are generated, may also be represented us- ing the band model. Each impurity atom of this type introduces an energy levelwithin the band gap, above yet very close to the top of the valence band (Figure18.15a). A hole is imagined to be created in the valence band by the thermal exci-tation of an electron from the valence band into this impurity electron state, asdemonstrated in Figure 18.15 b.With such a transition, only one carrier is produced—684 •Chapter 18 / Electrical Properties (a)Conduction bandValence bandBand gapFree electron in conduction bandEnergyEg (b)Donor stateFigure 18.13 (a) Electron energy band scheme for a donor impurity level located within the band gap and just below the bottom of the conduction band.

An impurity of this type is called an acceptor, because it is capable of accepting an electron from the valence band, leaving behind a hole. It follows that the energy level within the band gap introduced by this type of impu-rity is called an acceptor state. For this type of extrinsic conduction, holes are present in much higher con- centrations than electrons (i.e., ), and under these circumstances a materialis termed p-type because positively charged particles are primarily responsible for electrical conduction. Of course, holes are the majority carriers, and electrons arepresent in minority concentrations.

minority concentrations. This gives rise to a predominance of the secondterm on the right-hand side of Equation 18.13, or (18.17) For p-type semiconductors, the Fermi level is positioned within the band gap and near to the acceptor level. Extrinsic semiconductors (both n- and p-type) are produced from materials that are initially of extremely high purity, commonly having total impurity contents onthe order of at%. Controlled concentrations of specific donors or acceptorsare then intentionally added, using various techniques. Such an alloying process insemiconducting materials is termed doping. In extrinsic semiconductors, large numbers of charge carriers (either electrons or holes, depending on the impurity type) are created at room temperature, by theavailable thermal energy. As a consequence, relatively high room-temperature elec-trical conductivities are obtained in extrinsic semiconductors. Most of these materi-als are designed for use in electronic devices to be operated at ambient conditions.

A couple of features of this plot are worthnoting. First, the concentrations of electrons and holes increase with temperaturebecause, with rising temperature, more thermal energy is available to excite elec-trons from the valence to the conduction band (per Figure 18.6 b). In addition, at all temperatures, carrier concentration in Ge is greater than for Si. This effect is dueto germanium’s smaller band gap (0.67 versus 1.11 eV , Table 18.3); thus, for Ge, atany given temperature more electrons will be excited across its band gap. On the other hand, the carrier concentration–temperature behavior for an ex- trinsic semiconductor is much different. For example, electron concentration versus temperature for silicon that has been doped with phosphorus atoms is plot-ted in Figure 18.17.

donated elec-trons). Also, intrinsic excitations across the band gap are insignificant in relation tothese extrinsic donor excitations.The range of temperatures over which this extrinsicregion exists will depend on impurity concentration; furthermore, most solid-statedevices are designed to operate within this temperature range. At low temperatures, below about 100 K (Figure 18.17), electron concentration drops dramatically with decreasing temperature, and approaches zero at 0 K. Overthese temperatures, the thermal energy is insufficient to excite electrons from the Pdonor level into the conduction band. This is termed the “freeze-out temperature re-gion” inasmuch as charged carriers (i.e., electrons) are “frozen” to the dopant atoms. Finally, at the high end of the temperature scale of Figure 18.17, electron con- centration increases above the P content, and asymptotically approaches the intrin-sic curve as temperature increases. This is termed the “intrinsic temperature region”since at these high temperatures the semiconductor becomes intrinsic; that is, chargecarrier concentrations resulting from electron excitations across the band gap firstbecome equal to and then completely overwhelm the donor carrier contributionwith rising temperature.

Furthermore, magnitudes of electron andhole mobilities are influenced by the presence of those same crystalline defects thatare responsible for the scattering of electrons in metals—thermal vibrations (i.e.,temperature) and impurity atoms. We now explore the manner in which dopant im-purity content and temperature influence the mobilities of both electrons and holes. Influence of Dopant Content Figure 18.18 represents the dependence of electron and hole mobilities in siliconas a function of the dopant (both acceptor and donor) content, at room tempera-ture—note that both axes on this plot are scaled logarithmically. At dopant con-centrations less than about both carrier mobilities are at their maximumlevels and independent of the doping concentration. In addition, both mobilitiesdecrease with increasing impurity content.

impurity content. Also worth noting is that the mobilityof electrons is always larger than the mobility of holes. Influence of Temperature The temperature dependences of electron and hole mobilities for silicon are pre-sented in Figures 18.19 aand 18.19b , respectively. Curves for several impurity dopant contents are shown for both carrier types; furthermore, both sets of axes are scaledlogarithmically. From these plots, note that, for dopant concentrations of and below, both electron and hole mobilities decrease in magnitude with rising tem-perature; again, this effect is due to enhanced thermal scattering of the carriers. Forboth electrons and holes, and dopant levels less than the dependence ofmobility on temperature is independent of acceptor/donor concentration (i.e., is rep-resented by a single curve). Also, for concentrations greater than curves inboth plots are shifted to progressively lower mobility values with increasing dopantlevel. These latter two effects are consistent with the data presented in Figure 18.18. These previous treatments have discussed the influence of temperature and dopant content on both carrier concentration and carrier mobility.

electrical characteristics. Solution First, the elements that, when added to silicon, render it p-type, lie one group to the left of silicon in the periodic table. These include the group IIIA elements (Figure 2.6): boron, aluminum, gallium, and indium. Since this material is extrinsic and p-type (i.e., the electrical con- ductivity is a function of both hole concentration and hole mobility according toEquation 18.17. In addition, it will be assumed that at room temperature all ofthe acceptor dopant atoms have accepted electrons to form holes (i.e., that weare in the “extrinsic region” of Figure 18.17), which is to say that the number ofholes is approximately equal to the number of acceptor impurities This problem is complicated by the fact that is dependent on impurity content per Figure 18.18. Consequently, one approach to solving this problem istrial and error: assume an impurity concentration, and then compute the con-ductivity using this value and the corresponding hole mobility from its curve ofFigure 18.18.Then on the basis of this result, repeat the process assuming anotherimpurity concentration. For example, let us select an value (i.e., a pvalue) of At this concentration the hole mobility is approximately (Figure 18.18); these values yield a conductivity of which is a little on the high side. Decreasing the impurity content an order of magnitude to results in only a slight increase of to about 0.045 m 2/V-s (Figure 18.18); thus, the resulting conductivity is With some fine-tuning of these numbers, a conductivity of 50 is achieved when at this value, remains approximately 0.04 m2/V-s. It next becomes necessary to calculate the concentration of acceptor impu- rity in atom percent. This computation first requires the determination of thenumber of silicon atoms per cubic meter, using Equation 4.2, which is asfollows: /H110055/H1100310 28 m/H110023 /H1100516.023 /H110031023 atoms/mol 212.33 g/cm321106 cm3/m32 28.09 g/mol NSi/H11005NArSi ASiNSi,mh Na m/H110023; Na/H11005p /H11061 8 /H110031021(/H9024-m)/H110021 /H110057.2 1/H9024-m2/H110021 s/H1100511021 m/H110023211.6/H1100310/H1100219 C210.045 m2/V-s2mh 1021 m/H110023 /H1100564 1/H9024-m2/H110021 s/H11005p0e0mh/H1100511022 m/H110023211.6/H1100310/H1100219 C210.04 m2/V-s20.04 m2/V-s1022 m/H110023.

Such determinations are not possible from asimple electrical conductivity measurement; a Hall effect experiment must also be conducted. This Hall effect is a result of the phenomenon whereby a magnetic fieldapplied perpendicular to the direction of motion of a charged particle exerts a forceon the particle perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the particle motiondirections. In demonstrating the Hall effect, consider the specimen geometry shown in Figure 18.20, a parallelepiped specimen having one corner situated at the origin ofa Cartesian coordinate system. In response to an externally applied electric field,the electrons and/or holes move in the xdirection and give rise to a current When a magnetic field is imposed in the positive zdirection (denoted as ), the resulting force brought to bear on the charge carriers will cause them to be de-flected in the y direction—holes (positively charged carriers) to the right specimen face and electrons (negatively charged carriers) to the left face, as indicated inthe figure.

For metals, wherein conduction is by electrons, is negative and equal to (18.19) Thus, nmay be determined, inasmuch as may be measured using Equation 18.18 and the magnitude of e, the charge on an electron, is known. Furthermore, from Equation 18.8, the electron mobility is just (18.20a) or, using Equation 18.19, (18.20b) Thus, the magnitude of may also be determined if the conductivity has alsobeen measured. For semiconducting materials, the determination of majority carrier type and computation of carrier concentration and mobility are more complicated and willnot be discussed here.

electronic functions. Diodes and transistors, which have replacedold-fashioned vacuum tubes, are two familiar examples. Advantages of semicon-ductor devices (sometimes termed solid-state devices) include small size, low powerconsumption, and no warmup time. Vast numbers of extremely small circuits, eachconsisting of numerous electronic devices, may be incorporated onto a small siliconchip. The invention of semiconductor devices, which has given rise to miniaturizedcircuitry, is responsible for the advent and extremely rapid growth of a host of newindustries in the past few years. The p–n Rectifying Junction A rectifier, or diode, is an electronic device that allows the current to flow in one direction only; for example, a rectifier transforms an alternating current into directcurrent. Before the advent of the p–n junction semiconductor rectifier, this opera- tion was carried out using the vacuum tube diode. The p–n rectifying junction is constructed from a single piece of semiconductor that is doped so as to be n-type on one side and p-type on the other (Figure 18.21 a). If pieces of n- and p-type ma- terials are joined together, a poor rectifier results, since the presence of a surfacebetween the two sections renders the device very inefficient. Also, single crystals ofsemiconducting materials must be used in all devices because electronic phenom-ena that are deleterious to operation occur at grain boundaries. Before the application of any potential across the p–n specimen, holes will be the dominant carriers on the p-side, and electrons will predominate in the n-region, as illustrated in Figure 18.21 a. An external electric potential may be established across a p–n junction with two different polarities. When a battery is used, the pos- itive terminal may be connected to the p-side and the negative terminal to the n-side; this is referred to as a forward bias.

forward bias. The opposite polarity (minus to pand plus to n) is termed reverse bias. The response of the charge carriers to the application of a forward-biased po- tential is demonstrated in Figure 18.21 b. The holes on the p-side and the electrons on the n-side are attracted to the junction. As electrons and holes encounter oneanother near the junction, they continuously recombine and annihilate one another,according to (18.21) Thus for this bias, large numbers of charge carriers flow across the semiconductorand to the junction, as evidenced by an appreciable current and a low resistivity.The current–voltage characteristics for forward bias are shown on the right-handhalf of Figure 18.22. For reverse bias (Figure 18.21 c), both holes and electrons, as majority carriers, are rapidly drawn away from the junction; this separation of positive and negativeelectron /H11001hole ¡ energydiode rectifying junction forward bias reverse bias1496T_c18_665-721 12/21/05 12:53 Page 694REVISED PAGEScharges (or polarization) leaves the junction region relatively free of mobile charge carriers. Recombination will not occur to any appreciable extent, so that the junctionis now highly insulative. Figure 18.22 also illustrates the current–voltage behaviorfor reverse bias. The rectification process in terms of input voltage and output current is demon- strated in Figure 18.23.Whereas voltage varies sinusoidally with time (Figure 18.23 a), maximum current flow for reverse bias voltage is extremely small in comparisonto that for forward bias (Figure 18.23 b).

This gives rise to a very abrupt increase in current, a phenomenon known as breakdown, also shown in Figure 18.22, and discussed in more detail in Section 18.22. The Transistor Transistors, which are extremely important semiconducting devices in today’s mi-croelectronic circuitry, are capable of two primary types of function. First, they canperform the same operation as their vacuum tube precursor, the triode; that is, theycan amplify an electrical signal. In addition, they serve as switching devices in com-puters for the processing and storage of information. The two major types are thejunction (or bimodal) transistor and the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect tran- sistor (abbreviated as MOSFET). Junction Transistors The junction transistor is composed of two p–n junctions arranged back to back in either the n–p–n or the p–n–p configuration; the latter variety is discussed here. Fig- ure 18.24 is a schematic representation of a p–n–p junction transistor along with its attendant circuitry. A very thin n-type base region is sandwiched in between p-type emitter and collector regions. The circuit that includes the emitter–base junction (junction 1) is forward biased, whereas a reverse bias voltage is applied across thebase–collector junction (junction 2).

(junction 2). Figure 18.25 illustrates the mechanics of operation in terms of the motion of charge carriers. Since the emitter is p-type and junction 1 is forward biased, large numbers of holes enter the base region. These injected holes are minority carriersin the n-type base, and some will combine with the majority electrons. However, ifthe base is extremely narrow and the semiconducting materials have been properlyprepared, most of these holes will be swept through the base without recombina-tion, then across junction 2 and into the p-type collector. The holes now become apart of the emitter–collector circuit. A small increase in input voltage within theemitter–base circuit produces a large increase in current across junction 2.This largeincrease in collector current is also reflected by a large increase in voltage across696 •Chapter 18 / Electrical Properties TimeVoltage, V Reverse Forward0 –V0+V0 (a) TimeCurrent, I Reverse Forward0 IRIF (b)Figure 18.23 (a) Voltage versus time for the input to a p–n rectifying junction.

Thus, a voltage signal that passes through a junction transistor experiences amplification; this effectis also illustrated in Figure 18.24 by the two voltage–time plots. Similar reasoning applies to the operation of an n–p–n transistor, except that electrons instead of holes are injected across the base and into the collector. The MOSFET One variety of MOSFET8consists of two small islands of p-type semiconductor that are created within a substrate of n-type silicon, as shown in cross section in Figure 18.26; the islands are joined by a narrow p-type channel.

p-type channel. Appropriate metal connections (source and drain) are made to these islands; an insulating layer ofsilicon dioxide is formed by the surface oxidation of the silicon. A final connector(gate) is then fashioned onto the surface of this insulating layer. The conductivity of the channel is varied by the presence of an electric field im- posed on the gate. For example, imposition of a positive field on the gate will drivecharge carriers (in this case holes) out of the channel, thereby reducing the electrical18.15 Semiconductor Devices •697 Figure 18.25 For a junction transistor ( p–n–p type), the distributions and directions of electron and hole motion (a) when nopotential is applied and ( b) with appropriate bias for voltage amplification.Time Time0.1Emitter pJunction 2 Junction 1 Base nCollector p 10Input voltage (mV) Output voltage (mV)– ++ – Output voltageLoad Input voltage Reverse-biasing voltageForward-biasing voltageFigure 18.24 Schematic diagram of a p–n–p junction transistor and its associated circuitry, including input and output voltage–time characteristics showing voltage amplification.

In some respects, then,the operation of a MOSFET is very similar to that described for the junction tran-sistor. The primary difference is that the gate current is exceedingly small in com-parison to the base current of a junction transistor. MOSFETs are, therefore, usedwhere the signal sources to be amplified cannot sustain an appreciable current. Another important difference between MOSFETs and junction transistors is that, although majority carriers dominate in the functioning of MOSFETs (i.e.,holes for the depletion-mode p -type MOSFET of Figure 18.26), minority carriers do play a role with junction transistors (i.e., injected holes in the n-type base region, Figure 18.25).

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Semiconductors in Computers In addition to their ability to amplify an imposed electrical signal, transistors anddiodes may also act as switching devices, a feature utilized for arithmetic and logi-cal operations, and also for information storage in computers. Computer numbersand functions are expressed in terms of a binary code (i.e., numbers written to thebase 2). Within this framework, numbers are represented by a series of two states(sometimes designated 0 and 1). Now, transistors and diodes within a digital circuitoperate as switches that also have two states—on and off, or conducting and non-conducting; “off” corresponds to one binary number state, and “on” to the other.Thus, a single number may be represented by a collection of circuit elements con-taining transistors that are appropriately switched.

This revolution was precipitated, in part, byaerospace technology, which necessitated computers and electronic devices thatwere small and had low power requirements. As a result of refinement in process-ing and fabrication techniques, there has been an astonishing depreciation in thecost of integrated circuitry.

The process begins with the growth of relatively largecylindrical single crystals of high-purity silicon from which thin circular wafers arecut. Many microelectronic or integrated circuits, sometimes called “chips,” are pre-pared on a single wafer; a photograph of one such wafer containing numerous chipsis shown in Figure 22.27.

Enlarged photographs of microprocessor chips at different magnifications are presented in Figures 18.27 a and 18.27b ; these micrographs reveal the intricacy of integrated circuits. At this time, microprocessor chips approaching one billion transistors are being produced, and thisnumber doubles about every 18 months. Microelectronic circuits consist of many layers that lie within or are stacked on top of the silicon wafer in a precisely detailed pattern. Using photolithographictechniques, for each layer, very small elements are masked in accordance with amicroscopic pattern. Circuit elements are constructed by the selective introduc-tion of specific materials (by diffusion or ion implantation) into unmasked regionsto create localized n -type, p-type, high-resistivity, or conductive areas. This proce- dure is repeated layer by layer until the total integrated circuit has been fabricated,as illustrated in the MOSFET schematic (Figure 18.26).

(Figure 18.26). Elements of integratedcircuits are shown in Figure 18.27 and in the chapter-opening photographs for thischapter. Electrical Conduction in Ionic Ceramics and in Polymers Most polymers and ionic ceramics are insulating materials at room temperatureand, therefore, have electron energy band structures similar to that represented inFigure 18.4c; a filled valence band is separated from an empty conduction band bya relatively large band gap, usually greater than 2 eV . Thus, at normal temperaturesonly very few electrons may be excited across the band gap by the available ther-mal energy, which accounts for the very small values of conductivity; Table 18.4700 •Chapter 18 / Electrical Properties Table 18.4 Typical Room-Temperature ElectricalConductivities for 13 Nonmetallic Materials Electrical Conductivity Material [(/H9024-m)/H115461] Graphite Ceramics Concrete (dry) 10/H110029 Soda–lime glass 10/H1100210–10/H1100211 Porcelain 10/H1100210–10/H1100212 Borosilicate glass /H1101110/H1100213 Aluminum oxide /H1102110/H1100213 Fused silica /H1102110/H1100218 Polymers Phenol-formaldehyde 10/H110029–10/H1100210 Poly(methyl methacrylate) /H1102110/H1100212 Nylon 6,6 10/H1100212–10/H1100213 Polystyrene /H1102110/H1100214 Polyethylene 10/H1100215–10/H1100217 Polytetrafluoroethylene /H1102110/H11002173/H11003104–2/H11003105Case Study: “Materials for Inte-grated Circuit Pack-ages,” Chapter 22,which may be foundat www.wiley.com/ college/callister (Student CompanionSite).1496T_c18_665-722 1/3/06 13:44 Page 7002nd REVISE PAGESgives the room-temperature electrical conductivities of several of these materials.

these materials. (The electrical resistivities of a large number of ceramic and polymeric materialsare provided in Table B.9, Appendix B.) Of course, many materials are utilized onthe basis of their ability to insulate, and thus a high electrical resistivity is desirable.With rising temperature, insulating materials experience an increase in electricalconductivity, which may ultimately be greater than that for semiconductors. 18.16 CONDUCTION IN IONIC MATERIALS Both cations and anions in ionic materials possess an electric charge and, as a con-sequence, are capable of migration or diffusion when an electric field is present.Thus an electric current will result from the net movement of these charged ions,which will be present in addition to current due to any electron motion. Of course,anion and cation migrations will be in opposite directions. The total conductivity ofan ionic material is thus equal to the sum of both electronic and ionic contri-butions, as follows: (18.22) Either contribution may predominate depending on the material, its purity, and, ofcourse, temperature. A mobility may be associated with each of the ionic species as follows: (18.23) where and represent, respectively, the valence and diffusion coefficient of aparticular ion; e,k, and Tdenote the same parameters as explained earlier in the chapter. Thus, the ionic contribution to the total conductivity increases withincreasing temperature, as does the electronic component. However, in spite of thetwo conductivity contributions, most ionic materials remain insulative, even atelevated temperatures. 18.17 ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF POLYMERS Most polymeric materials are poor conductors of electricity (Table 18.4) becauseof the unavailability of large numbers of free electrons to participate in theconduction process. The mechanism of electrical conduction in these materials isnot well understood, but it is felt that conduction in polymers of high purity iselectronic.

purity iselectronic. Conducting Polymers Within the past several years, polymeric materials have been synthesized thathave electrical conductivities on par with metallic conductors; they are appro-priately termed conducting polymers. Conductivities as high as have been achieved in these materials; on a volume basis, this value correspondsto one-fourth of the conductivity of copper, or twice its conductivity on the basisof weight. This phenomenon is observed in a dozen or so polymers, including poly- acetylene, polyparaphenylene, polypyrrole, and polyaniline.

For example, the chain structure of polyacetylene is as follows:702 •Chapter 18 / Electrical Properties The valence electrons associated with the alternating single and double chain-bonds are delocalized, which means they are shared amongst the backbone atomsin the polymer chain—similar to the way that electrons in a partially filled bandfor a metal are shared by the ion cores. In addition, the band structure of a con-ductive polymer is characteristic of that for an electrical insulator (Figure 18.4c )— viz. at 0 K, a filled valence band separated from an empty conduction band by aforbidden energy band gap. These polymers become conductive when doped withappropriate impurities such as AsF 5, SbF 5, or iodine.

or iodine. As with semiconductors, conducting polymers may be made either n-type (i.e., free-electron dominant) or p-type (i.e., hole dominant) depending on the dopant. However, unlike semicon- ductors, the dopant atoms or molecules do not substitute for or replace any of thepolymer atoms. The mechanism by which large numbers of free electrons and holes are gen- erated in these conducting polymers is complex and not well understood. In verysimple terms, it appears that the dopant atoms lead to the formation of new en-ergy bands that overlap the valence and conduction bands of the intrinsic poly-mer, giving rise to a partially filled band, and the production at room temperatureof a high concentration of free electrons or holes. Orienting the polymer chains,either mechanically (Section 15.7) or magnetically, during synthesis results in ahighly anisotropic material having a maximum conductivity along the direction oforientation. These conducting polymers have the potential to be used in a host of applica- tions inasmuch as they have low densities, are highly flexible, and are easy to pro-duce. Rechargeable batteries and fuel cells are currently being manufactured thatemploy polymer electrodes. In many respects these batteries are superior to theirmetallic counterparts. Other possible applications include wiring in aircraft andaerospace components, antistatic coatings for clothing, electromagnetic screeningmaterials, and electronic devices (e.g., transistors and diodes). Dielectric Behavior A dielectric material is one that is electrically insulating (nonmetallic) and ex- hibits or may be made to exhibit an electric dipole structure; that is, there is a separation of positive and negative electrically charged entities on a molecularor atomic level. This concept of an electric dipole was introduced in Section 2.7.As a result of dipole interactions with electric fields, dielectric materials areutilized in capacitors.dielectric electric dipoleC C C C HH C HH CC HHRepeat unit C HH1496T_c18_665-721 12/21/05 12:53 Page 702REVISED PAGES18.18 CAPACITANCE When a voltage is applied across a capacitor, one plate becomes positively charged, the other negatively charged, with the corresponding electric field directed fromthe positive to the negative.

The val-ues of a number of dielectric materials are contained in Table 18.5. 18.19 FIELD VECTORS AND POLARIZATION Perhaps the best approach to an explanation of the phenomenon of capacitance iswith the aid of field vectors. To begin, for every electric dipole there is a separationbetween a positive and a negative electric charge as demonstrated in Figure 18.29.An electric dipole moment p is associated with each dipole as follows: (18.28) where qis the magnitude of each dipole charge and d is the distance of separa- tion between them.

In the presence of an electric field which is also a vector quantity, a force (or torque) willcome to bear on an electric dipole to orient it with the applied field; this phe-nomenon is illustrated in Figure 18.30. The process of dipole alignment is termedpolarization. Again, returning to the capacitor, the surface charge density D, or quantity of charge per unit area of capacitor plate (C/m 2), is proportional to the electric field. When a vacuum is present, then (18.29) the constant of proportionality being Furthermore, an analogous expressionexists for the dielectric case; that is, (18.30) Sometimes, Dis also called the dielectric displacement. The increase in capacitance, or dielectric constant, can be explained using a sim- plified model of polarization within a dielectric material. Consider the capacitor inFigure 18.31a, the vacuum situation, wherein a charge of is stored on the topplate and on the bottom one. When a dielectric is introduced and an electricfield is applied, the entire solid within the plates becomes polarized (Figure 18.31 c). As a result of this polarization, there is a net accumulation of negative charge ofmagnitude at the dielectric surface near the positively charged plate and, in asimilar manner, a surplus of charge at the surface adjacent to the negativeplate. For the region of dielectric removed from these surfaces, polarization effectsare not important. Thus, if each plate and its adjacent dielectric surface are consid-ered to be a single entity, the induced charge from the dielectric ( or ) maybe thought of as nullifying some of the charge that originally existed on the platefor a vacuum ( or ).

electric field. There are three types orsources of polarization: electronic, ionic, and orientation. Dielectric materials ordi-narily exhibit at least one of these polarization types depending on the material andalso the manner of the external field application. Electronic Polarization Electronic polarization may be induced to one degree or another in all atoms. It results from a displacement of the center of the negatively charged electron cloudrelative to the positive nucleus of an atom by the electric field (Figure 18.32 a). This polarization type is found in all dielectric materials and, of course, exists only whilean electric field is present. Ionic Polarization Ionic polarization occurs only in materials that are ionic. An applied field acts to displace cations in one direction and anions in the opposite direction, which givesrise to a net dipole moment. This phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 18.32 b.The magnitude of the dipole moment for each ion pair is equal to the product of therelative displacement and the charge on each ion, or (18.33) Orientation Polarization The third type, orientation polarization, is found only in substances that possess permanent dipole moments. Polarization results from a rotation of the permanentmoments into the direction of the applied field, as represented in Figure 18.32 c. This alignment tendency is counteracted by the thermal vibrations of the atoms,such that polarization decreases with increasing temperature.p i/H11005qdidipielectronic polarization ionic polarization orientation polarizationElectric dipole moment for an ionpair1496T_c18_665-721 12/21/05 12:53 Page 708REVISED PAGESThe total polarization Pof a substance is equal to the sum of the electronic, ionic, and orientation polarizations ( and respectively), or (18.34) It is possible for one or more of these contributions to the total polarization to be either absent or negligible in magnitude relative to the others.

finite time. For each polar-ization type, some minimum reorientation time exists, which depends on the easewith which the particular dipoles are capable of realignment.A relaxation frequency is taken as the reciprocal of this minimum reorientation time. A dipole cannot keep shifting orientation direction when the frequency of the applied electric field exceeds its relaxation frequency and, therefore, will not makea contribution to the dielectric constant.The dependence of on the field frequencyis represented schematically in Figure 18.34 for a dielectric medium that exhibitsall three types of polarization; note that the frequency axis is scaled logarithmically.As indicated in Figure 18.34, when a polarization mechanism ceases to function,there is an abrupt drop in the dielectric constant; otherwise, is virtually frequencyindependent. Table 18.5 gave values of the dielectric constant at 60 Hz and 1 MHz;these provide an indication of this frequency dependence at the low end of the fre-quency spectrum. The absorption of electrical energy by a dielectric material that is subjected to an alternating electric field is termed dielectric loss. This loss may be important at electric field frequencies in the vicinity of the relaxation frequency for each of theoperative dipole types for a specific material. A low dielectric loss is desired at thefrequency of utilization./H9280 r/H9280r710 •Chapter 18 / Electrical Properties +++ + + + + –– – – – – /H11546+ /H11546+ /H11546+ /H11546 (a)/H5105– +– – – – – ++ + + + +/H11546+ /H11546+ /H11546+ /H11546 (b)/H5105Figure 18.33 Dipole orientations for (a) one polarity of an alternating electric field and ( b) for the reversed polarity.

As aresult, the current through the dielectric by the motion of these electrons increasesdramatically; sometimes localized melting, burning, or vaporization produces irre-versible degradation and perhaps even failure of the material. This phenomenon isknown as dielectric breakdown.The dielectric strength, sometimes called the break- down strength, represents the magnitude of an electric field necessary to producebreakdown. Table 18.5 presented dielectric strengths for several materials. 18.23 DIELECTRIC MATERIALS A number of ceramics and polymers are utilized as insulators and/or in capacitors.Many of the ceramics, including glass, porcelain, steatite, and mica, have dielectricconstants within the range of 6 to 10 (Table 18.5). These materials also exhibit ahigh degree of dimensional stability and mechanical strength. Typical applicationsinclude powerline and electrical insulation, switch bases, and light receptacles. Thetitania (TiO 2) and titanate ceramics, such as barium titanate (BaTiO 3), can be made to have extremely high dielectric constants, which render them especially useful forsome capacitor applications.

capacitor applications. The magnitude of the dielectric constant for most polymers is less than for ce- ramics, since the latter may exhibit greater dipole moments: values for polymersgenerally lie between 2 and 5. These materials are commonly utilized for insulationof wires, cables, motors, generators, and so on, and, in addition, for some capacitors. Other Electrical Characteristics of Materials Two other relatively important and novel electrical characteristics that are found insome materials deserve brief mention—namely, ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity. 18.24 FERROELECTRICITY The group of dielectric materials called ferroelectrics exhibit spontaneous polarization—that is, polarization in the absence of an electric field. They are thedielectric analogue of ferromagnetic materials, which may display permanent mag-netic behavior.There must exist in ferroelectric materials permanent electric dipoles,the origin of which is explained for barium titanate, one of the most commonferroelectrics. The spontaneous polarization is a consequence of the positioning ofthe and ions within the unit cell, as represented in Figure 18.35. The ions are located at the corners of the unit cell, which is of tetragonal sym-metry (a cube that has been elongated slightly in one direction). The dipole mo-ment results from the relative displacements of the and ions from theirsymmetrical positions as shown in the side view of the unit cell. The ions arelocated near, but slightly below, the centers of each of the six faces, whereas the ion is displaced upward from the unit cell center. Thus, a permanent ionic di- pole moment is associated with each unit cell (Figure 18.35 b). However, when bar- ium titanate is heated above its ferroelectric Curie temperature [120°C (250°F)], the unit cell becomes cubic, and all ions assume symmetric positions within the cubicunit cell; the material now has a perovskite crystal structure (Section 12.2), and theferroelectric behavior ceases.Ti 4/H11001O2/H11002Ti4/H11001O2/H11002Ba2/H11001O2/H11002Ti4/H11001, Ba2/H11001,/H9280r18.24 Ferroelectricity •711 dielectric strength ferroelectric1496T_c18_665-721 12/21/05 12:53 Page 711REVISED PAGESSpontaneous polarization of this group of materials results as a consequence of interactions between adjacent permanent dipoles wherein they mutually align, all in the same direction.

same direction. For example, with barium titanate, the relative displacementsof and ions are in the same direction for all the unit cells within some vol-ume region of the specimen. Other materials display ferroelectricity; these includeRochelle salt potassium dihydrogen phosphate potassium niobate and lead zirconate–titanate Ferro- electrics have extremely high dielectric constants at relatively low applied field fre-quencies; for example, at room temperature, for barium titanate may be as highas 5000. Consequently, capacitors made from these materials can be significantlysmaller than capacitors made from other dielectric materials. 18.25 PIEZOELECTRICITY An unusual property exhibited by a few ceramic materials is piezoelectricity, or, lit-erally, pressure electricity: polarization is induced and an electric field is establishedacross a specimen by the application of external forces. Reversing the sign of an ex-ternal force (i.e., from tension to compression) reverses the direction of the field.The piezoelectric effect is demonstrated in Figure 18.36. This phenomenon and ex-amples of its application were discussed in the Materials of Importance piece thatfollows Section 13.8. Piezoelectric materials are utilized in transducers, which are devices that con- vert electrical energy into mechanical strains, or vice versa. Some other familiar ap-plications that employ piezoelectrics include phonograph cartridges, microphones,speakers, audible alarms, and ultrasonic imaging. In a phonograph cartridge, as thestylus traverses the grooves on a record, a pressure variation is imposed on a piezo-electric material located in the cartridge, which is then transformed into an electricsignal and is amplified before going to the speaker. Piezoelectric materials include titanates of barium and lead, lead zirconate ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and quartz.

On the basisof its conductivity, a solid material may be classified as a metal, a semiconductor,or an insulator. Electronic and Ionic Conduction Energy Band Structures in SolidsConduction in Terms of Band and Atomic Bonding Models For most materials, an electric current results from the motion of free electrons, which are accelerated in response to an applied electric field. The number of thesefree electrons depends on the electron energy band structure of the material. Anelectron band is just a series of electron states that are closely spaced with respectto energy, and one such band may exist for each electron subshell found in the iso-lated atom. By “electron energy band structure” is meant the manner in which theoutermost bands are arranged relative to one another and then filled with electrons.A distinctive band structure type exists for metals, for semiconductors, and for in-sulators. An electron becomes free by being excited from a filled state in one band,to an available empty state above the Fermi energy. Relatively small energies arerequired for electron excitations in metals, giving rise to large numbers of freeelectrons. Larger energies are required for electron excitations in semiconductorsand insulators, which accounts for their lower free electron concentrations andsmaller conductivity values.1496T_c18_665-721 12/21/05 12:53 Page 713REVISED PAGESElectron Mobility Free electrons being acted on by an electric field are scattered by imperfections in the crystal lattice.

crystal lattice. The magnitude of electron mobility is indicative of the frequencyof these scattering events. In many materials, the electrical conductivity is propor-tional to the product of the electron concentration and the mobility. Electrical Resistivity of Metals For metallic materials, electrical resistivity increases with temperature, impurity content, and plastic deformation. The contribution of each to the total resistivity isadditive. Intrinsic Semiconduction Extrinsic SemiconductionThe Temperature Dependence of Carrier ConcentrationFactors That Affect Carrier Mobility Semiconductors may be either elements (Si and Ge) or covalently bonded com- pounds. With these materials, in addition to free electrons, holes (missing electronsin the valence band) may also participate in the conduction process. On the basisof electrical behavior, semiconductors are classified as either intrinsic or extrinsic.For intrinsic behavior, the electrical properties are inherent in the pure material,and electron and hole concentrations are equal; electrical behavior is dictated byimpurities for extrinsic semiconductors. Extrinsic semiconductors may be either n -o r p-type depending on whether electrons or holes, respectively, are the predominantcharge carriers. Donor impurities introduce excess electrons; acceptor impurities in-troduce excess holes. The electrical conductivity of semiconducting materials is particularly sensitive to impurity type and content, as well as to temperature.The addition of even minute con-centrations of some impurities enhances the conductivity drastically. Furthermore, withrising temperature the intrinsic carrier concentration increases dramatically. For ex-trinsic semiconductors, with increasing impurity dopant content, the room-temperaturecarrier concentration increases whereas carrier mobility diminishes. Semiconductor Devices A number of semiconducting devices employ the unique electrical characteris- tics of these materials to perform specific electronic functions. Included are thep–nrectifying junction, and junction and MOSFET transistors.

MOSFET transistors. Transistors are used for amplification of electrical signals, as well as for switching devices incomputer circuitries. Capacitance Field Vectors and PolarizationTypes of PolarizationFrequency Dependence of the Dielectric Constant Dielectric materials are electrically insulative, yet susceptible to polarization in the presence of an electric field. This polarization phenomenon accounts for the abilityof the dielectrics to increase the charge storing capability of capacitors, the efficiencyof which is expressed in terms of a dielectric constant. Polarization results from theinducement by or orientation with the electric field of atomic or molecular dipoles;a dipole is said to exist when there is a net spatial separation of positively and714 •Chapter 18 / Electrical Properties 1496T_c18_665-721 12/21/05 12:53 Page 714REVISED PAGESnegatively charged entities. Possible polarization types include electronic, ionic, and orientation; not all types need be present in a particular dielectric. For alternatingelectric fields, whether a specific polarization type contributes to the total polar-ization and dielectric constant depends on frequency; each polarization mechanismceases to function when the applied field frequency exceeds its relaxation frequency. Ferroelectricity Piezoelectricity Also included in this chapter were brief discussions of two other electrical phe- nomena. Ferroelectric materials are those that may exhibit polarization sponta-neously, that is, in the absence of any external electric field. Finally, piezoelectricityis the phenomenon whereby polarization is induced in a material by the impositionof external forces.References •715 IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS Acceptor stateCapacitanceConduction bandConductivity, electricalDielectricDielectric constantDielectric displacementDielectric strengthDiodeDipole, electricDonor stateDopingElectrical resistanceElectron energy bandEnergy band gapExtrinsic semiconductorFermi energyFerroelectricForward biasFree electronHall effectHoleInsulatorIntegrated circuitIntrinsic semiconductorIonic conductionJunction transistorMatthiessen’s ruleMetalMobilityMOSFETOhm’s lawPermittivityPiezoelectricPolarizationPolarization, electronicPolarization, ionicPolarization, orientationRectifying junctionRelaxation frequencyResistivity, electricalReverse biasSemiconductorValence band REFERENCES Azaroff, L.

Materials selection decisions for components that are exposed to elevated/subambient temperatures, tem-perature changes, and/or thermal gradients requirethe design engineer to have an understanding of thethermal responses of materials, as well as access tothe thermal properties of a wide variety of materials.For example, in the discussion on materials that areused for the leadframe component of an integratedcircuit package (Section 22.16), we note restrictionsthat are imposed on the thermal characteristics ofthe adhesive material that attaches the integratedcircuit chip to the leadframe plate.

WHY STUDY the Thermal Properties of Materials?1496T_c19_722-739 12/20/05 19:05 Page 722REVISED PAGESLearning Objectives After careful study of this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1.Define heat capacity and specific heat . 2.Note the primary mechanism by which thermal energy is assimilated in solid materials. 3.Determine the linear coefficient of thermal ex-pansion given the length alteration that accom-panies a specified temperature change. 4.Briefly explain the phenomenon of thermalexpansion from an atomic perspective using apotential energy-versus-interatomic separation plot. 5.Define thermal conductivity. 6.Note the two principal mechanisms of heatconduction in solids, and compare the relativemagnitudes of these contributions for each ofmetals, ceramics, and polymeric materials. 19.1 INTRODUCTION By “thermal property” is meant the response of a material to the application ofheat. As a solid absorbs energy in the form of heat, its temperature rises and itsdimensions increase. The energy may be transported to cooler regions of the spec-imen if temperature gradients exist, and ultimately, the specimen may melt. Heatcapacity, thermal expansion, and thermal conductivity are properties that are oftencritical in the practical utilization of solids. 19.2 HEAT CAPACITY A solid material, when heated, experiences an increase in temperature signifyingthat some energy has been absorbed. Heat capacity is a property that is indicative of a material’s ability to absorb heat from the external surroundings; it representsthe amount of energy required to produce a unit temperature rise.

temperature rise. In mathemati-cal terms, the heat capacity C is expressed as follows: (19.1) where dQis the energy required to produce a dTtemperature change. Ordinar- ily, heat capacity is specified per mole of material (e.g., J/mol-K, or cal/mol-K).Specific heat (often denoted by a lowercase c) is sometimes used; this repre- sents the heat capacity per unit mass and has various units (J/kg-K, cal/g-K,Btu/lb m- There are really two ways in which this property may be measured, according to the environmental conditions accompanying the transfer of heat. One is the heatcapacity while maintaining the specimen volume constant, the other is for con-stant external pressure, which is denoted The magnitude of is almost alwaysgreater than however, this difference is very slight for most solid materials atroom temperature and below. Vibrational Heat Capacity In most solids the principal mode of thermal energy assimilation is by the increasein vibrational energy of the atoms. Again, atoms in solid materials are constantlyvibrating at very high frequencies and with relatively small amplitudes. Rather thanbeing independent of one another, the vibrations of adjacent atoms are coupled byvirtue of the atomic bonding. These vibrations are coordinated in such a way thattraveling lattice waves are produced, a phenomenon represented in Figure 19.1.These may be thought of as elastic waves or simply sound waves, having shortCv;Cp Cp.Cv;/H11034F).C/H11005dQ dTheat capacity specific heatDefinition of heat capacity—ratio ofenergy change(energy gainedor lost) and theresultingtemperature change1496T_c19_722-739 12/20/05 19:05 Page 723REVISED PAGES724 •Chapter 19 / Thermal Properties wavelengths and very high frequencies, which propagate through the crystal at the velocity of sound.

of sound. The vibrational thermal energy for a material consists of a seriesof these elastic waves, which have a range of distributions and frequencies. Onlycertain energy values are allowed (the energy is said to be quantized), and a singlequantum of vibrational energy is called a phonon. (A phonon is analogous to the quantum of electromagnetic radiation, the photon.) On occasion, the vibrational waves themselves are termed phonons. The thermal scattering of free electrons during electronic conduction (Section 18.7) is by these vibrational waves, and these elastic waves also participate in thetransport of energy during thermal conduction (see Section 19.4). Temperature Dependence of the Heat Capacity The variation with temperature of the vibrational contribution to the heat capac-ity at constant volume for many relatively simple crystalline solids is shown in Fig-ure 19.2.The is zero at 0 K, but it rises rapidly with temperature; this correspondsto an increased ability of the lattice waves to enhance their average energy withascending temperature. At low temperatures the relationship between and theabsolute temperature T is (19.2) where Ais a temperature-independent constant. Above what is called the Debye temperature levels off and becomes essentially independent of temperature at a value of approximately 3 R,Rbeing the gas constant. Thus even though the to- tal energy of the material is increasing with temperature, the quantity of energy re-quired to produce a one-degree temperature change is constant.

Appendix B. Other Heat Capacity Contributions Other energy-absorptive mechanisms also exist that can add to the total heat ca-pacity of a solid. In most instances, however, these are minor relative to the mag-nitude of the vibrational contribution. There is an electronic contribution in thatelectrons absorb energy by increasing their kinetic energy. However, this is possi-ble only for free electrons—those that have been excited from filled states to emptystates above the Fermi energy (Section 18.6). In metals, only electrons at statesnear the Fermi energy are capable of such transitions, and these represent only avery small fraction of the total number. An even smaller proportion of electronsexperiences excitations in insulating and semiconducting materials. Hence, thiselectronic contribution is ordinarily insignificant, except at temperatures near 0 K. Furthermore, in some materials other energy-absorptive processes occur at specific temperatures–for example, the randomization of electron spins in a ferro-magnetic material as it is heated through its Curie temperature. A large spike isproduced on the heat capacity-versus-temperature curve at the temperature of thistransformation. 19.3 THERMAL EXPANSION Most solid materials expand upon heating and contract when cooled.

In many materials, the value of is anisotropic; that is, it depends on the crystallographic direction along which it is measured. For materials in which the thermal expansion is isotropic,is approximately From an atomic perspective, thermal expansion is reflected by an increase in the average distance between the atoms. This phenomenon can best be understoodby consultation of the potential energy-versus-interatomic spacing curve for a solidmaterial introduced previously (Figure 2.8 b), and reproduced in Figure 19.3 a.T h e curve is in the form of a potential energy trough, and the equilibrium interatomicspacing at 0 K, corresponds to the trough minimum. Heating to successivelyhigher temperatures ( etc.) raises the vibrational energy from to to and so on. The average vibrational amplitude of an atom corresponds to the trough width at each temperature, and the average interatomic distance is repre-sented by the mean position, which increases with temperature from to to and so on. Thermal expansion is really due to the asymmetric curvature of this potential energy trough, rather than the increased atomic vibrational amplitudes with risingtemperature.

with risingtemperature. If the potential energy curve were symmetric (Figure 19.3 b), there would be no net change in interatomic separation and, consequently, no thermalexpansion. For each class of materials (metals, ceramics, and polymers), the greater the atomic bonding energy, the deeper and more narrow this potential energy trough.As a result, the increase in interatomic separation with a given rise in temperaturewill be lower, yielding a smaller value of Table 19.1 lists the linear coefficientsof thermal expansion for several materials.With regard to temperature dependence,the magnitude of the coefficient of expansion increases with rising temperature.Thevalues in Table 19.1 are taken at room temperature unless indicated otherwise.

Otherwise, it isanisotropic; and, in fact, some ceramic materials, upon heating, contract in somecrystallographic directions while expanding in others. For inorganic glasses, the co-efficient of expansion is dependent on composition. Fused silica (high-purity SiO 2 glass) has a small expansion coefficient, This is explained by a low atomic packing density such that interatomic expansion produces relativelysmall macroscopic dimensional changes. Ceramic materials that are to be subjected to temperature changes must have coefficients of thermal expansion that are relatively low, and in addition, isotropic.Otherwise, these brittle materials may experience fracture as a consequence ofnonuniform dimensional changes in what is termed thermal shock, as discussed later in the chapter. Polymers Some polymeric materials experience very large thermal expansions upon heat-ing as indicated by coefficients that range from approximately to The highest values are found in linear and branched polymers because the secondary intermolecular bonds are weak, and there is a minimum ofcrosslinking. With increased crosslinking, the magnitude of the expansion coefficientdiminishes; the lowest coefficients are found in the thermosetting network polymerssuch as phenol-formaldehyde, in which the bonding is almost entirely covalent.

metal alloys. Its composition is 64 wt%Fe–36 wt% Ni, and it has been given the trade-nameof “Invar” since the length of a specimen of this ma-terial is virtually invariable with changes in temper-ature. Its coefficient of thermal expansion near roomtemperature is One might surmise that this near zero expan- sion is explained by a symmetrical potential energy-versus-interatomic distance curve [Figure 19.3(b )]. Such is not so; rather, this behavior relates to themagnetic characteristics of Invar. Both iron andnickel are ferromagnetic materials (Section 20.4). Aferromagnetic material may be made to form a per-manent and strong magnet; upon heating, this prop-erty disappears at a specific temperature, called the“Curie temperature,” which temperature variesfrom one ferromagnetic material to another (Section20.6). As a specimen of Invar is heated, its tendencyto expand is counteracted by a contraction phenom-enon that is associated with its ferromagnetic prop-erties (which is termed “magnetostriction”). Aboveits Curie temperature (approximately Invarexpands in a normal manner, and its coefficient ofthermal expansion assumes a much greater value. Heat treating and processing of Invar will also affect its thermal expansion characteristics.The low-est values result for specimens quenched from el-evated temperatures (near that are then coldworked. Annealing leads to an increase in . Other low-expansion alloys have been de- veloped. One of these is called “Super–Invar”because its thermal expansion coefficient is lower than the value for In- var. However, the temperature range over whichits low expansion characteristics persist is rela-tively narrow. Compositionally, for Super–Invarsome of the nickel in Invar is replaced by anotherferromagnetic metal, cobalt; Super–Invar contains63 wt% Fe, 32 wt% Ni, and 5 wt% Co.[0.72 /H1100310 /H110026 (/H11034C)/H110021]al800/H11034C)al230/H11034C),1.6/H1100310/H110026 (/H11034C)/H110021.230/H11034C.

The thermal expansion coefficientof the metal alloy (Kovar) is approximately the sameas that of the Pyrex glass. Thus, with changes intemperature, the likelihood of the establishment ofthermal stresses and fracture at the junction areminimized. [Photograph courtesy of Moores (EVIC)Glassworks, Ltd., Walton-on-Thames, England. ]Another such alloy, with the trade-name of “Kovar,” has been designed to have expansion char- acteristics close to those of borosilicate (or Pyrex)glass; when joined to Pyrex and subjected to tem-perature variations, thermal stresses and possiblefracture at the junction are avoided.The compositionof Kovar is 54 wt% Fe, 29 wt% Ni, and 17 wt% Co.

Also, the minus sign in the ex-pression indicates that the direction of heat flow is from hot to cold, or down thetemperature gradient. Equation 19.5 is similar in form to Fick’s first law (Equation 5.3) for steady- state diffusion. For these expressions, kis analogous to the diffusion coefficient D, and the temperature gradient parallels the concentration gradient, Mechanisms of Heat Conduction Heat is transported in solid materials by both lattice vibration waves (phonons) andfree electrons. A thermal conductivity is associated with each of these mechanisms,and the total conductivity is the sum of the two contributions, or (19.6) where and represent the lattice vibration and electron thermal conductivities,respectively; usually one or the other predominates. The thermal energy associatedwith phonons or lattice waves is transported in the direction of their motion.The contribution results from a net movement of phonons from high- to low-temperature regions of a body across which a temperature gradient exists. Free or conducting electrons participate in electronic thermal conduction. To the free electrons in a hot region of the specimen is imparted a gain in kineticenergy.They then migrate to colder areas, where some of this kinetic energy is trans-ferred to the atoms themselves (as vibrational energy) as a consequence of colli-sions with phonons or other imperfections in the crystal. The relative contributionof to the total thermal conductivity increases with increasing free electron con-centrations, since more electrons are available to participate in this heat transfer-ence process. Metals In high-purity metals, the electron mechanism of heat transport is much more effi-cient than the phonon contribution because electrons are not as easily scattered asphonons and have higher velocities.

higher velocities. Furthermore, metals are extremely good con-ductors of heat because relatively large numbers of free electrons exist that partic-ipate in thermal conduction. The thermal conductivities of several of the commonmetals are given in Table 19.1; values generally range between about 20 and400 W/m-K. Since free electrons are responsible for both electrical and thermal conduction in pure metals, theoretical treatments suggest that the two conductivities should berelated according to the Wiedemann–Franz law: (19.7) where is the electrical conductivity, Tis the absolute temperature, and L is a con- stant. The theoretical value of L, should be independent of temperature and the same for all metals if the heat energy is transported entirelyby free electrons. Included in Table 19.1 are the experimental Lvalues for these2.44 /H1100310 /H110028 /H9024-W/H11408(K)2,sL/H11005k sTkeklke klk/H11005kl/H11001kedC/H11408dx./H11034FdT/H11408dx730 •Chapter 19 / Thermal Properties Weidemann-Franz law—for metals, theratio of thermalconductivity andthe product ofthe electricalconductivity andtemperature shouldbe a constant1496T_c19_722-739 12/20/05 19:05 Page 730REVISED PAGESseveral metals; note that the agreement between these and the theoretical value is quite reasonable (well within a factor of 2). Alloying metals with impurities results in a reduction in the thermal conduc- tivity, for the same reason that the electrical conductivity is diminished (Section18.8); namely, the impurity atoms, especially if in solid solution, act as scatteringcenters, lowering the efficiency of electron motion.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Ceramics Nonmetallic materials are thermal insulators inasmuch as they lack large numbersof free electrons. Thus the phonons are primarily responsible for thermal conduc-tion: is much smaller than Again, the phonons are not as effective as freeelectrons in the transport of heat energy as a result of the very efficient phononscattering by lattice imperfections. Thermal conductivity values for a number of ceramic materials are contained in Table 19.1; room-temperature thermal conductivities range between approxi-mately 2 and 50 W/m-K. Glass and other amorphous ceramics have lower conduc-tivities than crystalline ceramics, since the phonon scattering is much more effectivewhen the atomic structure is highly disordered and irregular. The scattering of lattice vibrations becomes more pronounced with rising tem- perature; hence, the thermal conductivity of most ceramic materials normallydiminishes with increasing temperature, at least at relatively low temperatures (Fig-ure 19.5).As Figure 19.5 indicates, the conductivity begins to increase at higher tem-peratures, which is due to radiant heat transfer: significant quantities of infraredradiant heat may be transported through a transparent ceramic material. Theefficiency of this process increases with temperature.k l. ke19.4 Thermal Conductivity •731 Composition (wt% Zn)Thermal conductivity (W/m-K) Thermal conductivity (Btu/ft-h-°F) 01 0 2 0 3 0 4 0050100150200250 0100200300400Figure 19.4 Thermal conductivity versus composition for copper–zincalloys.

In fact, many ceramics that are used for ther-mal insulation are porous. Heat transfer across pores is ordinarily slow and ineffi-cient. Internal pores normally contain still air, which has an extremely low thermalconductivity—approximately 0.02 W/m-K. Furthermore, gaseous convection withinthe pores is also comparatively ineffective. Concept Check 19.3 The thermal conductivity of a single-crystal ceramic specimen is slightly greater thana polycrystalline one of the same material. Why is this so? [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Polymers As noted in Table 19.1, thermal conductivities for most polymers are on the orderof 0.3 W/m-K. For these materials, energy transfer is accomplished by the vibrationand rotation of the chain molecules. The magnitude of the thermal conductivity de-pends on the degree of crystallinity; a polymer with a highly crystalline and orderedstructure will have a greater conductivity than the equivalent amorphous material.This is due to the more effective coordinated vibration of the molecular chains forthe crystalline state. Polymers are often utilized as thermal insulators because of their low thermal conductivities.As with ceramics, their insulative properties may be further enhancedby the introduction of small pores, which are ordinarily introduced by foaming732 •Chapter 19 / Thermal Properties Temperature (°C)Thermal conductivity (W/m-K) (Btu/ft-h-°F) Thermal conductivity (cal/cm-s-K) 0 400 800 1200Dense stabilized ZrO2Pure dense Al2O3Pure dense MgOPure dense BeOGraphite 1600 20001.0101001.0 0.1 0.01 0.0011.010100400 1200 2000Temperature (°F) 2800 3600 Figure 19.5 Dependence of thermal conductivity on temperature for several ceramic materials.

An understanding of the origins and nature of thermal stresses is importantbecause these stresses can lead to fracture or undesirable plastic deformation. Stresses Resulting From Restrained Thermal Expansion and Contraction Let us first consider a homogeneous and isotropic solid rod that is heated or cooled uniformly; that is, no temperature gradients are imposed. For free expansion or con-traction, the rod will be stress free. If, however, axial motion of the rod is restrainedby rigid end supports, thermal stresses will be introduced. The magnitude of thestress resulting from a temperature change from to is (19.8) where Eis the modulus of elasticity and is the linear coefficient of thermal expansion.

thermal expansion. Upon heating the stress is compressive since rod ex-pansion has been constrained. Of course, if the rod specimen is cooled a tensile stress will be imposed Also, the stress in Equation 19.8 is thesame as the stress that would be required to elastically compress (or elongate) therod specimen back to its original length after it had been allowed to freely expand(or contract) with the temperature change. EXAMPLE PROBLEM 19.1 Thermal Stress Created Upon Heating A brass rod is to be used in an application requiring its ends to be held rigid.If the rod is stress free at room temperature what is the maxi- mum temperature to which the rod may be heated without exceeding a com-pressive stress of 172 MPa (25,000 psi)?

temperature change. Thermal stresses may be established as a result of temper-ature gradients across a body, which are frequently caused by rapid heating orcooling, in that the outside changes temperature more rapidly than the interior; dif-ferential dimensional changes serve to restrain the free expansion or contraction ofadjacent volume elements within the piece. For example, upon heating, the exteriorof a specimen is hotter and, therefore, will have expanded more than the interiorregions. Hence, compressive surface stresses are induced and are balanced by ten-sile interior stresses. The interior–exterior stress conditions are reversed for rapidcooling such that the surface is put into a state of tension. Thermal Shock of Brittle Materials For ductile metals and polymers, alleviation of thermally induced stresses may beaccomplished by plastic deformation. However, the nonductility of most ceramicsenhances the possibility of brittle fracture from these stresses. Rapid cooling of abrittle body is more likely to inflict such thermal shock than heating, since the in-duced surface stresses are tensile. Crack formation and propagation from surfaceflaws are more probable when an imposed stress is tensile (Section 12.8). The capacity of a material to withstand this kind of failure is termed its thermal shock resistance. For a ceramic body that is rapidly cooled, the resistance to ther-mal shock depends not only on the magnitude of the temperature change, but alsoon the mechanical and thermal properties of the material. The thermal shock re-sistance is best for ceramics that have high fracture strengths and high thermalconductivities, as well as low moduli of elasticity and low coefficients of thermal ex-pansion. The resistance of many materials to this type of failure may be approxi-mated by a thermal shock resistance parameter TSR: (19.9) Thermal shock may be prevented by altering the external conditions to the de- gree that cooling or heating rates are reduced and temperature gradients across abody are minimized.

The intro-duction of some relatively large pores or a ductile second phase may also improvethe thermal shock characteristics of a material; both serve to impede the propaga-tion of thermally induced cracks. It is often necessary to remove thermal stresses in ceramic materials as a means of improving their mechanical strengths and optical characteristics. This may be ac-complished by an annealing heat treatment, as discussed for glasses in Section 13.9.

Section 13.9. SUMMARY Heat Capacity This chapter discussed heat absorption, thermal expansion, and thermal conduc- tion—three important thermal phenomena. Heat capacity represents the quantityof heat required to produce a unit rise in temperature for one mole of a substance;on a per-unit mass basis, it is termed specific heat. Most of the energy assimilatedby many solid materials is associated with increasing the vibrational energy of theatoms; contributions to the total heat capacity by other energy-absorptive mecha-nisms (i.e., increased free-electron kinetic energies) are normally insignificant. For many crystalline solids and at temperatures within the vicinity of 0 K, the heat capacity measured at constant volume varies as the cube of the absolutetemperature; in excess of the Debye temperature, becomes temperature inde-pendent, assuming a value of approximately 3 R. Thermal Expansion Solid materials expand when heated and contract when cooled. The fractional change in length is proportional to the temperature change, the constant of pro-portionality being the coefficient of thermal expansion. Thermal expansion is re-flected by an increase in the average interatomic separation, which is a consequenceof the asymmetric nature of the potential energy versus interatomic spacing curvetrough. The larger the interatomic bonding energy, the lower is the coefficient ofthermal expansion. Thermal Conductivity The transport of thermal energy from high- to low-temperature regions of a material is termed thermal conduction. For steady-state heat transport, the flux is propor-tional to the temperature gradient along the direction of flow; the proportionalityconstant is the thermal conductivity. For solid materials, heat is transported by free electrons and by vibrational lat- tice waves, or phonons. The high thermal conductivities for relatively pure metalsare due to the large numbers of free electrons, and also the efficiency with whichthese electrons transport thermal energy. By way of contrast, ceramics and poly-mers are poor thermal conductors because free-electron concentrations are low andphonon conduction predominates.C v3/H1100310/H110026 (/H11034C)/H110021;9/H1100310/H110026 (/H11034C)/H110021,alSummary •7351496T_c19_722-739 12/20/05 19:05 Page 735REVISED PAGESThermal Stresses Thermal stresses, which are introduced in a body as a consequence of temperature changes, may lead to fracture or undesirable plastic deformation.

plastic deformation. The two primesources of thermal stresses are restrained thermal expansion (or contraction) andtemperature gradients established during heating or cooling. Thermal shock is the fracture of a body resulting from thermal stresses induced by rapid temperature changes. Because ceramic materials are brittle, they areespecially susceptible to this type of failure. The thermal shock resistance of manymaterials is proportional to the fracture strength and thermal conductivity, andinversely proportional to both the modulus of elasticity and the coefficient of ther-mal expansion.736 •Chapter 19 / Thermal Properties IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS Heat capacityLinear coefficient of thermal expansionPhononSpecific heatThermal conductivityThermal shockThermal stress REFERENCES Kingery, W.

Many of our modern technological devices rely on magnet-ism and magnetic materials; these include electrical power generators and trans-formers, electric motors, radio, television, telephones, computers, and componentsof sound and video reproduction systems. Iron, some steels, and the naturally occurring mineral lodestone are well-known examples of materials that exhibit magnetic properties. Not so familiar, however, isthe fact that all substances are influenced to one degree or another by the presenceof a magnetic field.This chapter provides a brief description of the origin of magneticfields and discusses the various magnetic field vectors and magnetic parameters; thephenomena of diamagnetism, paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, and ferrimagnetism;some of the different magnetic materials; and the phenomenon of superconductivity. 20.2 BASIC CONCEPTS Magnetic Dipoles Magnetic forces are generated by moving electrically charged particles; these mag-netic forces are in addition to any electrostatic forces that may prevail. Many timesit is convenient to think of magnetic forces in terms of fields. Imaginary lines offorce may be drawn to indicate the direction of the force at positions in the vicin-ity of the field source. The magnetic field distributions as indicated by lines of forceare shown for a current loop and also a bar magnet in Figure 20.1.

Figure 20.1. Magnetic dipoles are found to exist in magnetic materials, which, in some re- spects, are analogous to electric dipoles (Section 18.19). Magnetic dipoles may bethought of as small bar magnets composed of north and south poles instead of pos-itive and negative electric charges. In the present discussion, magnetic dipolemoments are represented by arrows, as shown in Figure 20.2. Magnetic dipoles areinfluenced by magnetic fields in a manner similar to the way in which electric dipolesare affected by electric fields (Figure 18.30). Within a magnetic field, the force ofthe field itself exerts a torque that tends to orient the dipoles with the field. A fa-miliar example is the way in which a magnetic compass needle lines up with theearth’s magnetic field.1496T_c20_76-113 10/31/05 16:31 Page 77FIRST PAGESMagnetic Field Vectors Before discussing the origin of magnetic moments in solid materials, we describe magnetic behavior in terms of several field vectors. The externally applied mag-netic field, sometimes called the magnetic field strength, is designated by H .I f the magnetic field is generated by means of a cylindrical coil (or solenoid) consistingof Nclosely spaced turns, having a length l,and carrying a current of magnitude I,then (20.1) A schematic diagram of such an arrangement is shown in Figure 20.3a .The magnetic field that is generated by the current loop and the bar magnet in Figure 20.1 is anHfield. The units of H are ampere-turns per meter, or just amperes per meter. The magnetic induction, or magnetic flux density, denoted by B, represents the magnitude of the internal field strength within a substance that is subjected to anHfield. The units for B are teslas [or webers per square meter Both B and Hare field vectors, being characterized not only by magnitude, but also by direction in space.

Several parameters may be used to describe the magnetic properties of solids. One of these is the ratio of the permeability in a material to the permeability in a vacuum, or (20.4) where is called the relative permeability, which is unitless. The permeability or relative permeability of a material is a measure of the degree to which the materialcan be magnetized, or the ease with which a Bfield can be induced in the presence of an external Hfield. Another field quantity, M,called the magnetization of the solid, is defined by the expression (20.5) In the presence of an Hfield, the magnetic moments within a material tend to be- come aligned with the field and to reinforce it by virtue of their magnetic fields;the term in Equation 20.5 is a measure of this contribution.

Furthermore, the magnetization Mand polarization Pare correlates (Equations 20.5 and 18.31). Magnetic units may be a source of confusion because there are really two systems in common use. The ones used thus far are SI [rationalized MKS (meter- kilogram-second)]; the others come from the (centimeter-gram-second- electromagnetic unit) system. The units for both systems as well as the appropriateconversion factors are contained in Table 20.1. Origins of Magnetic Moments The macroscopic magnetic properties of materials are a consequence of magnetic moments associated with individual electrons. Some of these concepts are relatively complex and involve some quantum-mechanical principles beyond the scope of thisdiscussion; consequently, simplifications have been made and some of the detailsomitted. Each electron in an atom has magnetic moments that originate from twosources.

Other susceptibilities are also possible; see Problem 20.3.xm1496T_c20_76-113 10/31/05 16:31 Page 80FIRST PAGEScharge, an electron may be considered to be a small current loop, generating a very small magnetic field, and having a magnetic moment along its axis of rotation, asschematically illustrated in Figure 20.4 a. Each electron may also be thought of as spinning around an axis; the other magnetic moment originates from this electron spin, which is directed along thespin axis as shown in Figure 20.4 b.Spin magnetic moments may be only in an “up” direction or in an antiparallel “down” direction. Thus each electron in an atom maybe thought of as being a small magnet having permanent orbital and spin magneticmoments. The most fundamental magnetic moment is the Bohr magneton which is of magnitude For each electron in an atom the spin magnetic moment is (plus for spin up, minus for spin down). Furthermore, the orbitalmagnetic moment contribution is equal to being the magnetic quantumnumber of the electron, as mentioned in Section 2.3. In each individual atom, orbital moments of some electron pairs cancel each other; this also holds for the spin moments. For example, the spin moment of anelectron with spin up will cancel that of one with spin down. The net magneticmoment, then, for an atom is just the sum of the magnetic moments of each of theconstituent electrons, including both orbital and spin contributions, and taking intoaccount moment cancellation.

moment cancellation. For an atom having completely filled electron shellsor subshells, when all electrons are considered, there is total cancellation of bothorbital and spin moments. Thus materials composed of atoms having completelyfilled electron shells are not capable of being permanently magnetized. This cate-gory includes the inert gases (He, Ne, Ar, etc.) as well as some ionic materials. Thetypes of magnetism include diamagnetism, paramagnetism, and ferromagnetism; inaddition, antiferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism are considered to be subclassesof ferromagnetism.All materials exhibit at least one of these types, and the behaviordepends on the response of electron and atomic magnetic dipoles to the applicationof an externally applied magnetic field. 20.3 DIAMAGNETISM AND PARAMAGNETISM Diamagnetism is a very weak form of magnetism that is nonpermanent and persists only while an external field is being applied. It is induced by a change in the orbitalmotion of electrons due to an applied magnetic field. The magnitude of the inducedmagnetic moment is extremely small, and in a direction opposite to that of the ap-plied field. Thus, the relative permeability is less than unity (however, only veryslightly), and the magnetic susceptibility is negative; that is, the magnitude of the B field within a diamagnetic solid is less than that in a vacuum. The volume suscep-tibility for diamagnetic solid materials is on the order of When placedbetween the poles of a strong electromagnet, diamagnetic materials are attractedtoward regions where the field is weak./H1100210 /H110025. xmmrmlmB, ml/H11006mB9.27 /H1100310/H1100224 A-m2.mB,20.3 Diamagnetism and Paramagnetism •81 Magnetic moment Atomic nucleusElectron + (a)Magnetic moment Direction of spinElectron (b)Figure 20.4 Demonstration of the magnetic moment associated with (a)an orbiting electron and ( b) a spinning electron.

Table 20.2 gives the susceptibilities of several diamagnetic materials. Diamagnet- ism is found in all materials; but because it is so weak, it can be observed onlywhen other types of magnetism are totally absent. This form of magnetism is ofno practical importance. For some solid materials, each atom possesses a permanent dipole moment by virtue of incomplete cancellation of electron spin and/or orbital magnetic moments.In the absence of an external magnetic field, the orientations of these atomic mag-netic moments are random, such that a piece of material possesses no net macro-scopic magnetization. These atomic dipoles are free to rotate, and paramagnetism results when they preferentially align, by rotation, with an external field as shownin Figure 20.5 b.These magnetic dipoles are acted on individually with no mutual82 •Chapter 20 / Magnetic Properties H = 0H (a) H = 0H (b)Figure 20.5 (a) The atomic dipole configuration for a diamagnetic material with and without a magnetic field.

adjacent dipoles. Inasmuch as the dipoles align with the exter- nal field, they enhance it, giving rise to a relative permeability that is greater thanunity, and to a relatively small but positive magnetic susceptibility. Susceptibilitiesfor paramagnetic materials range from about to (Table 20.2). A schematicB-versus-H curve for a paramagnetic material is also shown in Figure 20.6. Both diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials are considered to be nonmag- netic because they exhibit magnetization only when in the presence of an externalfield. Also, for both, the flux density B within them is almost the same as it would be in a vacuum. 20.4 FERROMAGNETISM Certain metallic materials possess a permanent magnetic moment in the absenceof an external field, and manifest very large and permanent magnetizations. Theseare the characteristics of ferromagnetism, and they are displayed by the transi- tion metals iron (as BCC ferrite), cobalt, nickel, and some of the rare earth met-als such as gadolinium (Gd). Magnetic susceptibilities as high as are possiblefor ferromagnetic materials. Consequently, and from Equation 20.5 wewrite (20.8) Permanent magnetic moments in ferromagnetic materials result from atomic magnetic moments due to electron spin—uncancelled electron spins as a consequenceof the electron structure. There is also an orbital magnetic moment contribution that is small in comparison to the spin moment. Furthermore, in a ferromagnetic mate-rial, coupling interactions cause net spin magnetic moments of adjacent atoms toalign with one another, even in the absence of an external field. This is schemati-cally illustrated in Figure 20.7. The origin of these coupling forces is not completelyunderstood, but it is thought to arise from the electronic structure of the metal. Thismutual spin alignment exists over relatively large volume regions of the crystalcalled domains (see Section 20.7).

In one such group, this coupling results in an antiparallel alignment; the alignment of the spin moments ofneighboring atoms or ions in exactly opposite directions is termed antiferromag- netism. Manganese oxide (MnO) is one material that displays this behavior. Man- ganese oxide is a ceramic material that is ionic in character, having both and ions. No net magnetic moment is associated with the ions, since there is a total cancellation of both spin and orbital moments. However, the ions pos-sess a net magnetic moment that is predominantly of spin origin. These ionsare arrayed in the crystal structure such that the moments of adjacent ions are an-tiparallel. This arrangement is represented schematically in Figure 20.8. Obviously,the opposing magnetic moments cancel one another, and, as a consequence, thesolid as a whole possesses no net magnetic moment. Ferrimagnetism Some ceramics also exhibit a permanent magnetization, termed ferrimagnetism. The macroscopic magnetic characteristics of ferromagnets and ferrimagnets are similar;the distinction lies in the source of the net magnetic moments. The principles of fer-rimagnetism are illustrated with the cubic ferrites. 2These ionic materials may be represented by the chemical formula in which M represents any one ofseveral metallic elements. The prototype ferrite is the mineral magnetite,sometimes called lodestone. The formula for may be written as in which the Fe ions exist in both /H11001 2 and /H11001 3 valence states in the ratio of 1:2.

of 1:2. A net spin mag- netic moment exists for each and ion, which corresponds to 4 and 5 Bohrmagnetons, respectively, for the two ion types. Furthermore, the ions are mag-netically neutral. There are antiparallel spin-coupling interactions between the Feions, similar in character to antiferromagnetism. However, the net ferrimagneticmoment arises from the incomplete cancellation of spin moments. Cubic ferrites have the inverse spinel crystal structure, which is cubic in sym- metry, and similar to the spinel structure (Section 12.2).

Again, there are two types of positions that may be oc-cupied by the iron cations, as illustrated in Figure 12.7.

Figure 12.7. For one, the coordinationnumber is 4 (tetrahedral coordination); that is, each Fe ion is surrounded by fouroxygen nearest neighbors. For the other, the coordination number is 6 (octahedralcoordination). With this inverse spinel structure, half the trivalent ions aresituated in octahedral positions, the other half, in tetrahedral positions. The diva-lent ions are all located in octahedral positions. The critical factor is thearrangement of the spin moments of the Fe ions, as represented in Figure 20.9 andTable 20.3. The spin moments of all the ions in the octahedral positions are aligned parallel to one another; however, they are directed oppositely to the ions disposed in the tetrahedral positions, which are also aligned. This results fromthe antiparallel coupling of adjacent iron ions. Thus, the spin moments of all ions cancel one another and make no net contribution to the magnetization of thesolid. All the ions have their moments aligned in the same direction; this totalmoment is responsible for the net magnetization (see Table 20.3). Thus, the satura-tion magnetization of a ferrimagnetic solid may be computed from the product ofthe net spin magnetic moment for each ion and the number of ions; thiswould correspond to the mutual alignment of all the ion magnetic momentsin the specimen. Cubic ferrites having other compositions may be produced by adding metallic ions that substitute for some of the iron in the crystal structure.

Ceramic materials other than the cubic ferrites are also ferrimagnetic; these include the hexagonal ferrites and garnets. Hexagonal ferrites have a crystal struc-ture similar to the inverse spinel, with hexagonal symmetry rather than cubic.

On the other hand, ferrites, being ceramic materials, are good electri-cal insulators. For some magnetic applications, such as high-frequency transformers,a low electrical conductivity is most desirable.

Recall that raising the temperature of a solid results in an increase in the magnitude of the thermal vibrations of atoms.The atomic magnetic moments are free to rotate; hence,with rising temperature, the increased thermal motion of the atoms tends to ran-domize the directions of any moments that may be aligned. For ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and ferrimagnetic materials, the atomic thermal motions counteract the coupling forces between the adjacent atomic dipolemoments, causing some dipole misalignment, regardless of whether an external fieldis present. This results in a decrease in the saturation magnetization for both ferro-and ferrimagnets.

ferro-and ferrimagnets. The saturation magnetization is a maximum at 0 K, at which tem-perature the thermal vibrations are a minimum. With increasing temperature, thesaturation magnetization diminishes gradually and then abruptly drops to zero atwhat is called the Curie temperature The magnetization-temperature behavior for iron and is represented in Figure 20.10. At the mutual spin couplingforces are completely destroyed, such that for temperatures above both ferro-magnetic and ferrimagnetic materials are paramagnetic.The magnitude of the Curietemperature varies from material to material; for example, for iron, cobalt, nickel,and the respective values are 768, 1120, 335, and Antiferromagnetism is also affected by temperature; this behavior vanishes at what is called the Néel temperature. At temperatures above this point, antiferromagnetic materials also become paramagnetic.

Such a re-gion is called a domain, and each one is magnetized to its saturation magnetization.Adjacent domains are separated by domain boundaries or walls, across which thedirection of magnetization gradually changes (Figure 20.12). Normally, domains aremicroscopic in size, and for a polycrystalline specimen, each grain may consist ofmore than a single domain.

single domain. Thus, in a macroscopic piece of material, there will bea large number of domains, and all may have different magnetization orientations.The magnitude of the M field for the entire solid is the vector sum of the magne- tizations of all the domains, each domain contribution being weighted by its vol-ume fraction. For an unmagnetized specimen, the appropriately weighted vectorsum of the magnetizations of all the domains is zero.T c90 •Chapter 20 / Magnetic Properties Temperature (°C)Temperature (°F)Saturation magnetization, Ms(106 A/m) Saturation flux density, Bs(gauss) –200 0 200 400Fe3O4Pure Fe 600 800 100000.51.01.52.0–400 0 400 800 1200 160025,000 20,000 15,000 10,000 5,000 0Figure 20.10 Plot of saturation magnetization asafunction of temperature for ironand [Adaptedfrom J.

through X). This process continues with increasing field strength until the macroscopic speci- men becomes a single domain, which is nearly aligned with the field (inset Y). Sat-uration is achieved when this domain, by means of rotation, becomes oriented withthe Hfield (inset Z). Alteration of the domain structure with magnetic field for an iron single crystal is shown in the chapter-opening photographs for this chapter. From saturation, point S in Figure 20.14, as the Hfield is reduced by reversal of field direction, the curve does not retrace its original path. A hysteresis effect is produced in which the Bfield lags behind the applied Hfield, or decreases at a lower rate. At zero H field (point R on the curve), there exists a residual Bfield that is called the r emanence, or remanent flux density, the material remains mag- netized in the absence of an external Hfield. Hysteresis behavior and permanent magnetization may be explained by the motion of domain walls. Upon reversal of the field direction from saturation (pointSin Figure 20.14), the process by which the domain structure changes is reversed. First, there is a rotation of the single domain with the reversed field. Next, do- mains having magnetic moments aligned with the new field form and grow at theexpense of the former domains. Critical to this explanation is the resistance tomovement of domain walls that occurs in response to the increase of the mag-netic field in the opposite direction; this accounts for the lag of B with H,or the hysteresis. When the applied field reaches zero, there is still some net volume frac-tion of domains oriented in the former direction, which explains the existence ofthe remanence To reduce the B field within the specimen to zero (point C on Figure 20.14), an Hfield of magnitude must be applied in a direction opposite to that of the original field; is called the coercivity, or sometimes the coercive force.

Upon con- tinuation of the applied field in this reverse direction, as indicated in the figure, sat-uration is ultimately achieved in the opposite sense, corresponding to point Asecond reversal of the field to the point of the initial saturation (point S) completes the symmetrical hysteresis loop and also yields both a negative remanence and a positive coercivity The B-versus-H curve in Figure 20.14 represents a hysteresis loop taken to sat- uration. Of course, it is not necessary to increase the Hfield to saturation before reversing the field direction; in Figure 20.15, loop NPis a hysteresis curve corre- sponding to less than saturation.

This dependence of magnetic behav- ior on crystallographic orientation is termed magnetic (or sometimes magnetocryst- alline) anisotropy. For each of these materials there is one crystallographic direction in which mag- netization is easiest—that is, saturation (of M) is achieved at the lowest Hfield; this is termed a direction of easy magnetization. For example, for Ni (Figure 20.17) this direction is [111] inasmuch as saturation occurs at point A; whereas, for [110] and[100] orientations, saturation points correspond, respectively, to points B and C.Correspondingly, easy magnetization directions for Fe and Co are [100] and [0001],respectively (Figures 20.17 and 20.18). Conversely, a hard crystallographic direction is that direction for which saturation magnetization is most difficult; hard directionsfor Ni, Fe, and Co are [100], [111], and As noted in the previous section, the insets of Figure 20.13 represent domain configurations at various stages along the B(or M) versus H curve during the mag- netization of a ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic material.

ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic material. Here, each of the arrows rep-resents a domain’s direction of easy magnetization; and domains whose directionsof easy magnetization are most closely aligned with the Hfield grow, at the expense of the other domains that shrink (insets V through X). Furthermore, the magneti-zation of the single domain in inset Y also corresponds to an easy direction. Andsaturation is achieved as the direction of this domain rotates away from the easydirection into the direction of the applied field (inset Z). 20.9 SOFT MAGNETIC MATERIALS The size and shape of the hysteresis curve for ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic ma- terials is of considerable practical importance. The area within a loop represents amagnetic energy loss per unit volume of material per magnetization–demagnetizationcycle; this energy loss is manifested as heat that is generated within the magnetic specimen and is capable of raising its temperature.

hysteresis characteristics. Soft magnetic materials are used in devices that are subjected to alternating magnetic fields and in which energy losses must be low; one familiar example consists of transformer cores. For thisreason the relative area within the hysteresis loop must be small; it is characteris-tically thin and narrow, as represented in Figure 20.19. Consequently, a soft mag-netic material must have a high initial permeability and a low coercivity.A materialpossessing these properties may reach its saturation magnetization with a relativelylow applied field (i.e., is easily magnetized and demagnetized) and still has lowhysteresis energy losses. The saturation field or magnetization is determined only by the composition of the material. For example, in cubic ferrites, substitution of a divalent metalion such as for in will change the saturation magnetization. However, susceptibility and coercivity which also influence the shape of thehysteresis curve, are sensitive to structural variables rather than to composition.For example, a low value of coercivity corresponds to the easy movement of do- main walls as the magnetic field changes magnitude and/or direction. Structuraldefects such as particles of a nonmagnetic phase or voids in the magnetic mate-rial tend to restrict the motion of domain walls, and thus increase the coercivity.Consequently, a soft magnetic material must be free of such structural defects. Another property consideration for soft magnetic materials is electrical resis- tivity. In addition to the hysteresis energy losses described above, energy losses mayresult from electrical currents that are induced in a magnetic material by a mag-netic field that varies in magnitude and direction with time; these are called eddy currents. It is most desirable to minimize these energy losses in soft magnetic ma- terials by increasing the electrical resistivity. This is accomplished in ferromagneticmaterials by forming solid solution alloys; iron–silicon and iron–nickel alloys areexamples.

alloys areexamples. The ceramic ferrites are commonly used for applications requiringsoft magnetic materials because they are intrinsically electrical insulators.

One alloy commonly used for thisapplication is the iron–silicon alloy listed in Table20.5 (97 wt% Fe-3 wt% Si). Single crystals of this alloy are magnetically anisotropic, as are also singlecrystals of iron (as explained above). Consequently,energy losses of transformers could be minimized iftheir cores were fabricated from single crystals suchthat a [100]-type direction [the direction of easymagnetization (Figure 20.17)] is oriented parallel tothe direction of an applied magnetic field; this con-figuration for a transformer core is representedschematically in Figure 20.20. Unfortunately, singlecrystals are expensive to prepare, and, thus, this isan economically unpractical situation. A better al-ternative—one that is used commercially, beingmore economically attractive—is to fabricate coresfrom polycrystalline sheets of this alloy that areanisotropic.

that areanisotropic. It is often the case that the grains in polycrys- talline materials are randomly oriented, with the re-sult that their properties are isotropic (Section 3.15).However, one way of developing anisotropy inpolycrystalline metals is via plastic deformation, forexample by rolling (Section 11.4, Figure 11.8 b); rolling is the technique by which sheet transformercores are fabricated. A flat sheet that has been rolledis said to have a rolling (or sheet) texture, or there is a preferred crystallographic orientation of the grains.For this type of texture, during the rolling operation, for most of the grains in the sheet, a specific crys-tallographic plane (hkl) becomes is aligned parallel(or nearly parallel) to the surface of the sheet, and,in addition a direction [u vw] in that plane lies par- allel (or nearly parallel) to the rolling direction.Thus, a rolling texture is indicated by the plane– direction combination, (hkl)[u vw]. For body- centered cubic alloys (to include the iron–siliconalloy mentioned above), the rolling texture is (110)[001], which is represented schematically in Figure20.21. Thus, transformer cores of this iron–siliconalloy are fabricated such the direction in which thesheet was rolled (corresponding to a [001]-type di-rection for most of the grains) is aligned parallel tothe direction of the magnetic field application. 3 The magnetic characteristics of this alloy may be further improved through a series of deforma-tion and heat-treating procedures that produce a(100)[001] texture.

The properties of a half-dozen soft magnetic materials are shown in Table 20.5. The hysteresis characteristics of soft magnetic materials may be enhanced for some applications by an appropriate heat treatment in the presence of a magneticfield. Using such a technique, a square hysteresis loop may be produced, which isdesirable in some magnetic amplifier and pulse transformer applications. In addi-tion, soft magnetic materials are used in generators, motors, dynamos, and switch-ing circuits. 20.10 HARD MAGNETIC MATERIALS Hard magnetic materials are utilized in permanent magnets, which must have a highresistance to demagnetization. In terms of hysteresis behavior, a hard magnetic material has a high remanence, coercivity, and saturation flux density, as well as a low initial permeability, and high hysteresis energy losses.

High-Energy Hard Magnetic Materials Permanent magnetic materials having energy products in excess of about 80 kJ/m3 (10 MGOe) are considered to be of the high-energy type. These are recentlydeveloped intermetallic compounds that have a variety of compositions; the twothat have found commercial exploitation are SmCo 5and Nd 2Fe14B. Their magnetic properties are also listed in Table 20.6. Samarium–Cobalt Magnets SmCo 5is a member of a group of alloys that are combinations of cobalt or iron and a light rare earth element; a number of these alloys exhibit high-energy, hard mag-netic behavior,but SmCo 5is the only one of commercial significance. The energy products of these SmCo 5materials [between 120 and 240 kJ/m3(15 and 30 MGOe)] are considerably higher than the conventional hard magnetic materials (Table 20.6);in addition, they have relatively large coercivities.

large coercivities. Powder metallurgical techniquesare used to fabricate SmCo 5magnets. The appropriately alloyed material is first ground into a fine powder; the powder particles are aligned using an external mag-netic field and then pressed into the desired shape. The piece is then sintered at anelevated temperature, followed by another heat treatment that improves the mag-netic properties. Neodymium–Iron–Boron Magnets Samarium is a rare and relatively expensive material; furthermore, the price of cobaltis variable and its sources are unreliable. Consequently, the Nd 2Fe14B alloys have become the materials of choice for a large number and wide diversity of applications100 •Chapter 20 / Magnetic Properties Table 20.6 Typical Properties for Several Hard Magnetic Materials.

Coercivities and energy products of these materials rival those of the samarium–cobalt alloys (Table 20.6). The magnetization–demagnetization behavior of these materials is a function of domain wall mobility, which, in turn, is controlled by the final microstructure—that is, the size, shape, and orientation of the crystallites or grains, as well as the na-ture and distribution of any second-phase particles that are present. Of course,microstructure will depend on how the material is processed. Two different pro-cessing techniques are available for the fabrication of Nd 2Fe14B magnets: powder metallurgy (sintering) and rapid solidification (melt spinning). The powder metal-lurgical approach is similar to that used for the SmCo 5materials. For rapid solidification, the alloy, in molten form, is quenched very rapidly such that eitheran amorphous or very fine grained and thin solid ribbon is produced. This ribbonmaterial is then pulverized, compacted into the desired shape, and subsequentlyheat treated. Rapid solidification is the more involved of the two fabricationprocesses; nevertheless, it is continuous, whereas powder metallurgy is a batchprocess, which has its inherent disadvantages. These high-energy hard magnetic materials are employed in a host of different devices in a variety of technological fields. One common application is in motors. Permanent magnets are far superior to electromagnets in that their magnetic fieldsare continuously maintained and without the necessity of expending electricalpower; furthermore, no heat is generated during operation.

during operation. Motors using permanentmagnets are much smaller than their electromagnet counterparts and are utilizedextensively in fractional horsepower units. Familiar motor applications include thefollowing: in cordless drills and screw drivers; in automobiles (starting, windowwinder, wiper, washer, and fan motors); in audio and video recorders; and in clocks.Other common devices that employ these magnetic materials are speakers in audiosystems, lightweight earphones, hearing aids, and computer peripherals. 20.11 MAGNETIC STORAGE Within the past few years, magnetic materials have become increasingly important in the area of information storage; in fact, magnetic recording has become virtuallythe universal technology for the storage of electronic information. This is evidencedby the preponderance of audio tapes, VCRs, disk storage media, credit cards, andso on. Whereas in computers, semiconductor elements serve as primary memory,magnetic disks are used for secondary memory because they are capable of storinglarger quantities of information and at a lower cost. Furthermore, the recording andtelevision industries rely heavily on magnetic tapes for the storage and reproduc-tion of audio and video sequences. In essence, computer bytes, sound, or visual images in the form of electrical sig- nals are recorded on very small segments of the magnetic storage medium—a tapeor disk.Transference to and retrieval from the tape or disk is accomplished by meansof an inductive read–write head, which consists basically of a wire coil wound arounda magnetic material core into which a gap is cut. Data are introduced (or “written”)by the electrical signal within the coil, which generates a magnetic field across thegap. This field in turn magnetizes a very small area of the disk or tape within theproximity of the head. Upon removal of the field, the magnetization remains; thatis, the signal has been stored. The essential features of this recording process areshown in Figure 20.23.

Figure 20.23. Furthermore, the same head may be utilized to retrieve (or “read”) the stored information. A voltage is induced when there is a change in the magnetic field as20.11 Magnetic Storage •101 1496T_c20_76-113 10/31/05 16:31 Page 101FIRST PAGESthe tape or disk passes by the head coil gap; this may be amplified and then con- verted back into its original form or character. This process is also represented inFigure 20.23. Recently, hybrid heads that consist of an inductive-write and a magnetoresistive read head in a single unit have been introduced. In the magnetoresistive head, theelectrical resistance of the magnetoresistive thin film element is changed as a resultof magnetic field changes when the tape or disk passes by the read head. Higher sen-sitivies and higher data transfer rates make magnetoresistive heads very attractive. There are two principal types of magnetic media— particulate and thin film. Particulate media consist of very small needle-like or acicular particles, normallyof -Fe 2O3ferrite or CrO 2;these are applied and bonded to a polymeric film (for magnetic tapes) or to a metal or polymer disk. During manufacture, theseparticles are aligned with their long axes in a direction that parallels the direc-tion of motion past the head (see Figures 20.23 and 20.24). Each particle is ag102 •Chapter 20 / Magnetic Properties Recording medium Recording head Signal inWriteSignal outReadWidth GapFigure 20.23 Schematic representation showing how information is stored andretrieved using a magneticstorage medium.

Two magnetic states are possible, corresponding to the saturation mag-netization in one axial direction, and its opposite. These two states make possi-ble the storage of information in digital form, as 1’s and 0’s. In one system, a 1is represented by a reversal in the magnetic field direction from one small areaof the storage medium to another as the numerous acicular particles of each suchregion pass by the head. A lack of reversal between adjacent regions is indicatedby a 0. The thin-film storage technology is relatively new and provides higher storage capacities at lower costs. It is employed mainly on rigid disk drives and consists ofa multilayered structure. A magnetic thin-film layer is the actual storage compo-nent (see Figure 20.25). This film is normally either a CoPtCr or CoCrTa alloy, witha thickness of between 10 and 50 nm. A substrate layer below and upon which thethin film resides is pure chromium or a chromium alloy. The thin film itself is20.11 Magnetic Storage •103 (b) (a)Figure 20.25 (a) A high- resolution transmission electron micrograph showingthe microstructure of acobalt–chromium–platinumthin film that is used as ahigh-density magnetic storagemedium.

Each grain within the thin film is a single magnetic domain, and it is highly desir-able that grain shape and size be relatively uniform. For magnetic storage disks thatemploy these thin films, the crystallographic direction of easy magnetization foreach grain is aligned in the direction of disk motion (or the direction opposite) (seeFigure 20.25). The mechanism of magnetic storage within each of these single- domain grains is the same as for the needle-shaped particles, as described above—that is, the two magnetic states correspond to domain magnetization in one directionor its antiparallel equivalent. The storage density of thin films is greater than for particulate media because the packing efficiency of thin-film domains is greater than for the acicular particles;particles will always be separated with void space in between. At the time of thiswriting, storage densities for particulate media are on the order of bit/in. 2 For thin films, storage densities are approximately an order of magnitude greater [i.e., Regarding specific magnetic properties, the hysteresis loops for these magnetic storage media should be relatively large and square. These characteristics ensurethat storage will be permanent, and, in addition, magnetization reversal will resultover a narrow range of applied field strengths. For particulate recording media,saturation flux density normally ranges from 0.4 to 0.6 tesla (4000 and 6000 gauss).For thin films, will lie between 0.6 and 1.2 tesla (6000 and 12,000 gauss).

12,000 gauss). Coercivity values are typically in the range of to A/m (2000 to3000 Oe). 20.12 SUPERCONDUCTIVITY Superconductivity is basically an electrical phenomenon; however, its discussion hasbeen deferred to this point because there are magnetic implications relative to thesuperconducting state, and, in addition, superconducting materials are used prima-rily in magnets capable of generating high fields. As most high-purity metals are cooled down to temperatures nearing 0 K, the electrical resistivity decreases gradually, approaching some small yet finite valuethat is characteristic of the particular metal. There are a few materials, however, forwhich the resistivity, at a very low temperature, abruptly plunges from a finite valueto one that is virtually zero and remains there upon further cooling. Materials thatdisplay this latter behavior are called superconductors, and the temperature at which they attain superconductivity is called the critical temperature 5The resistivity– temperature behaviors for superconductive and nonsuperconductive materials arecontrasted in Figure 20.26. The critical temperature varies from superconductor tosuperconductor but lies between less than 1 K and approximately 20 K for metalsand metal alloys. Recently, it has been demonstrated that some complex oxideceramics have critical temperatures in excess of 100 K. At temperatures below the superconducting state will cease upon applica- tion of a sufficiently large magnetic field, termed the critical field which de-pends on temperature and decreases with increasing temperature. The same maybe said for current density; that is, a critical applied current density exists below J CHC,TC,TC.2.5/H110031051.5/H11003105Bs/H110115/H110031010 bit/in.2 (8/H11003107 bit/mm2)].

In this discussion they are denoted by and respectively.T C, TcTc1496T_c20_76-113 10/31/05 16:31 Page 104FIRST PAGESwhich a material is superconductive. Figure 20.27 shows schematically the bound- ary in temperature-magnetic field-current density space separating normal and su-perconducting states. The position of this boundary will, of course, depend on thematerial. For temperature, magnetic field, and current density values lying betweenthe origin and this boundary, the material will be superconductive; outside theboundary, conduction is normal. The superconductivity phenomenon has been satisfactorily explained by means of a rather involved theory. In essence, the superconductive state results from at-tractive interactions between pairs of conducting electrons; the motions of thesepaired electrons become coordinated such that scattering by thermal vibrations andimpurity atoms is highly inefficient. Thus, the resistivity, being proportional to theincidence of electron scattering, is zero. On the basis of magnetic response, superconducting materials may be divided into two classifications designated as type I and type II. Type I materials, while inthe superconducting state, are completely diamagnetic; that is, all of an applied mag-netic field will be excluded from the body of material, a phenomenon known as theMeissner effect, which is illustrated in Figure 20.28. As His increased, the material remains diamagnetic until the critical magnetic field is reached. At this point,conduction becomes normal, and complete magnetic flux penetration takes place.H C20.12 Superconductivity •105 Figure 20.26 Temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity for normally conductingand superconducting materials inthe vicinity of 0 K.

I group. Type II superconductors are completely diamagnetic at low applied fields, and field exclusion is total. However, the transition from the superconducting state tothe normal state is gradual and occurs between lower critical and upper criticalfields, designated and respectively. The magnetic flux lines begin to pen-etrate into the body of material at and with increasing applied magnetic field,this penetration continues; at field penetration is complete. For fields between and the material exists in what is termed a mixed state—both normal and superconducting regions are present. Type II superconductors are preferred over type I for most practical applica- tions by virtue of their higher critical temperatures and critical magnetic fields. Atpresent, the three most commonly utilized superconductors are niobium–zirconium(Nb–Zr) and niobium–titanium (Nb–Ti) alloys and the niobium–tin intermetalliccompound Nb 3Sn. Table 20.7 lists several type I and II superconductors, their crit- ical temperatures, and their critical magnetic flux densities. Recently, a family of ceramic materials that are normally electrically insulative have been found to be superconductors with inordinately high critical temperatures.Initial research has centered on yttrium barium copper oxide, YBa 2Cu3O7,which has a critical temperature of about 92 K. This material has a complex perovskite-type crystal structure (Section 12.2). New superconducting ceramic materialsreported to have even higher critical temperatures have been and are currently be-ing developed. Several of these materials and their critical temperatures are listedin Table 20.7. The technological potential of these materials is extremely promisinginasmuch as their critical temperatures are above 77 K, which permits the use ofliquid nitrogen, a very inexpensive coolant in comparison to liquid hydrogen andliquid helium. These new ceramic superconductors are not without drawbacks, chiefof which is their brittle nature.

brittle nature. This characteristic limits the ability of these materi-als to be fabricated into useful forms such as wires. The phenomenon of superconductivity has many important practical implica- tions. Superconducting magnets capable of generating high fields with low powerconsumption are currently being employed in scientific test and research equip-ment. In addition, they are also used for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in themedical field as a diagnostic tool. Abnormalities in body tissues and organs can bedetected on the basis of the production of cross-sectional images. Chemical analy-sis of body tissues is also possible using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).Numerous other potential applications of superconducting materials also exist.H C 2, HC1HC 2,HC 1,HC 2, HC1106 •Chapter 20 / Magnetic Properties (b) (a)Figure 20.28 Representation of the Meissner effect.

The chief deterrent to the widespread application of thesesuperconducting materials is, of course, the difficulty in attaining and maintainingextremely low temperatures. Hopefully, this problem will be overcome with the de-velopment of the new generation of superconductors with reasonably high criticaltemperatures.

SUMMARY Basic Concepts The macroscopic magnetic properties of a material are a consequence of interac- tions between an external magnetic field and the magnetic dipole moments of the constituent atoms. Associated with each individual electron are both orbital andspin magnetic moments. The net magnetic moment for an atom is just the sum ofthe contributions of each of its electrons, wherein there will be spin and orbitalmoment cancellation of electron pairs.Summary •107 Table 20.7 Critical Temperatures and Magnetic Fluxes for Selected Superconducting Materials Critical Temperature Critical Magnetic Material TC(K) Flux Density B C(tesla)a Elementsb Tungsten 0.02 0.0001 Titanium 0.40 0.0056 Aluminum 1.18 0.0105 Tin 3.72 0.0305 Mercury (/H9251) 4.15 0.0411 Lead 7.19 0.0803 Compounds and Alloysb Nb–Ti alloy 10.2 12 Nb–Zr alloy 10.8 11 PbMo 6S8 14.0 45 V3Ga 16.5 22 Nb 3Sn 18.3 22 Nb 3Al 18.9 32 Nb 3Ge 23.0 30 Ceramic Compounds YBa 2Cu3O7 92 — Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10 110 — Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10 125 — HgBa 2Ca2Cu2O8 153 — aThe critical magnetic flux density for the elements was measured at 0 K.

are diamagnetic. Paramagnetic materials are those having permanentatomic dipoles, which are acted on individually and are aligned in the direction ofan external field. Since the magnetizations are relatively small and persist only whilean applied field is present, diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials are consideredto be nonmagnetic. Ferromagnetism Large and permanent magnetizations may be established within the ferromagnetic metals (Fe, Co, Ni). Atomic magnetic dipole moments are of spin origin, which arecoupled and mutually aligned with moments of adjacent atoms. Antiferromagnetism and Ferrimagnetism Antiparallel coupling of adjacent cation spin moments is found for some ionic ma-terials. Those in which there is total cancellation of spin moments are termed anti-ferromagnetic. With ferrimagnetism, permanent magnetization is possible becausespin moment cancellation is incomplete. For cubic ferrites, the net magnetizationresults from the divalent ions (e.g., Fe 2/H11001) that reside on octahedral lattice sites, the spin moments of which are all mutually aligned. The Influence of Temperature on Magnetic Behavior With rising temperature, increased thermal vibrations tend to counteract the di- pole coupling forces in ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials. Consequently, the saturation magnetization gradually diminishes with temperature, up to the Curie temperature, at which point it drops to near zero; above these materials areparamagnetic. Domains and Hysteresis Below its Curie temperature, a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material is composed of domains—small-volume regions wherein all net dipole moments are mutuallyaligned and the magnetization is saturated. The total magnetization of the solid isjust the appropriately weighted vector sum of the magnetizations of all these domains.As an external magnetic field is applied, domains having magnetization vectors ori-ented in the direction of the field grow at the expense of domains that have unfa-vorable magnetization orientations.

magnetization orientations. At total saturation, the entire solid is a singledomain and the magnetization is aligned with the field direction. The change indomain structure with increase or reversal of a magnetic field is accomplished bythe motion of domain walls. Both hysteresis (the lag of the Bfield behind the ap- plied Hfield) as well as permanent magnetization (or remanence) result from the resistance to movement of these domain walls. Magnetic Anisotropy The M(or B) versus Hbehavior for a ferromagnetic single crystal is anisotropic— that is, dependent on the crystallographic direction along which the magnetic field is applied. The crystallographic direction for which is achieved at the lowestHfield is an easy magnetization direction; for Fe, Ni, and Co easy directions are, respectively, [100], [111], and [0001].M sTc,108 •Chapter 20 / Magnetic Properties1496T_c20_76-113 10/31/05 16:31 Page 108FIRST PAGESSoft Magnetic Materials Hard Magnetic Materials For soft magnetic materials, domain wall movement is easy during magnetization and demagnetization. Consequently, they have small hysteresis loops and low en- ergy losses. Domain wall motion is much more difficult for the hard magnetic ma-terials, which results in larger hysteresis loops; because greater fields are requiredto demagnetize these materials, the magnetization is more permanent. Magnetic Storage Information storage is accomplished using magnetic materials in both needle- shaped particulate and thin-film forms. Superconductivity Superconductivity has been observed in a number of materials, in which, upon cooling and in the vicinity of absolute zero temperature, the electrical resistivity vanishes.The superconducting state ceases to exist if temperature, magnetic field, or current density exceeds the critical value. For type I superconductors, magnetic field exclu-sion is complete below a critical field, and field penetration is complete once isexceeded.

once isexceeded. This penetration is gradual with increasing magnetic field for type II ma-terials. New complex oxide ceramics are being developed with relatively high criti-cal temperatures, which allow inexpensive liquid nitrogen to be used as a coolant.H CReferences •109 IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS AntiferromagnetismBohr magnetonCoercivityCurie temperatureDiamagnetismDomainFerrimagnetism Ferrite (ceramic)Ferromagnetism Hard magnetic materialHysteresisMagnetic field strengthMagnetic flux densityMagnetic inductionMagnetic susceptibilityMagnetizationParamagnetismPermeabilityRemanenceSaturation magnetizationSoft magnetic materialSuperconductivity REFERENCES Azaroff, L.

When materials are exposed to electromagnetic radi- ation, it is sometimes important to be able to pre-dict and alter their responses.

their responses. This is possible whenwe are familiar with their optical properties and un-derstand the mechanisms responsible for their opticalbehaviors. For example, in Section 21.14 on opticalfiber materials, we note that the performance of op- tical fibers is increased by introducing a gradual vari-ation of the index of refraction (i.e., a graded index)at the outer surface of the fiber. This is accomplishedby the addition of specific impurities in controlled concentrations.WHY STUDY the Optical Properties of Materials ?1496T_c21_114-142 10/31/05 20:19 Page 114FIRST PAGES21.1 INTRODUCTION By “optical property” is meant a material’s response to exposure to electromag- netic radiation and, in particular, to visible light. This chapter first discusses someof the basic principles and concepts relating to the nature of electromagnetic radi-ation and its possible interactions with solid materials. Next to be explored arethe optical behaviors of metallic and nonmetallic materials in terms of theirabsorption, reflection, and transmission characteristics. The final sections outlineluminescence, photoconductivity, and light amplification by stimulated emission ofradiation (laser), the practical utilization of these phenomena, and optical fibers incommunications. Basic Concepts 21.2 ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION In the classical sense, electromagnetic radiation is considered to be wave-like, con-sisting of electric and magnetic field components that are perpendicular to eachother and also to the direction of propagation (Figure 21.1). Light, heat (or radiantenergy), radar, radio waves, and x-rays are all forms of electromagnetic radiation.Each is characterized primarily by a specific range of wavelengths, and also ac-cording to the technique by which it is generated. The electromagnetic spectrum of radiation spans the wide range from -rays (emitted by radioactive materials)having wavelengths on the order of m ( nm), through x-rays, ultraviolet,visible, infrared, and finally radio waves with wavelengths as long as m. Thisspectrum, on a logarithmic scale, is shown in Figure 21.2.10 510/H11002310/H1100212gLearning Objectives After careful study of this chapter you should be able to do the following: 1.Compute the energy of a photon given its fre- quency and the value of Planck’s constant.

The spectral ranges for the several colors are included in Figure 21.2.White light is simply a mixture of all colors. The ensuing discussion is concerned primarily with this visible radiation, by definition the only radiation to which the eyeis sensitive. All electromagnetic radiation traverses a vacuum at the same velocity, that of light—namely, m/s (186,000 miles/s). This velocity, c,is related to the electric permittivity of a vacuum and the magnetic permeability of a vacuum through (21.1) Thus, there is an association between the electromagnetic constant cand these elec- trical and magnetic constants.

Furthermore, the frequency and the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation are a function of velocity according to (21.2) Frequency is expressed in terms of hertz (Hz), and 1 Hz cycle per second. Ranges of frequency for the various forms of electromagnetic radiation are alsoincluded in the spectrum (Figure 21.2)./H110051c/H11005lnl nc/H110051 1/H92800 m0m0 /H928003/H11003108mm, mmmm. 4/H1100310/H110027mm116 •Chapter 21 / Optical Properties 108Energy (eV) Wavelength (m) 1 angstrom (Å)Violet Blue Green Yellow Orange Red 0.7 /H9262m0.6 /H9262m0.5 /H9262m0.4 /H9262mVisible spectrum wavelength 1 nanometer (nm) 1 micrometer (/H9262m) 1 millimeter (mm) 1 meter (m)1 kilometer (km)Frequency (Hz) 10 6 104 102 100 10–2 10–4 10–6 10–8 10–101022 1020 1018 1016 1014 1012 1010 108 106 10410–14 10–12 10–10 10–8 10–6 10–4 10–2 100 102 104/H9253-Rays X-Rays Ultraviolet Infrared Microwave Radio, TV–VisibleFigure 21.2 The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, including wavelength ranges for the various colors in the visible spectrum.

called photons. The energy Eof a photon is said to be quantized, or can only have specific values, defined by the relationship (21.3) where his a universal constant called Planck’s constant, which has a value of J-s. Thus, photon energy is proportional to the frequency of the radi- ation, or inversely proportional to the wavelength. Photon energies are also includedin the electromagnetic spectrum (Figure 21.2). When describing optical phenomena involving the interactions between radia- tion and matter, an explanation is often facilitated if light is treated in terms ofphotons. On other occasions, a wave treatment is more appropriate; at one time oranother, both approaches are used in this discussion.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 21.3 LIGHT INTERACTIONS WITH SOLIDS When light proceeds from one medium into another (e.g., from air into a solid sub- stance), several things happen. Some of the light radiation may be transmittedthrough the medium, some will be absorbed, and some will be reflected at the in-terface between the two media. The intensity of the beam incident to the surfaceof the solid medium must equal the sum of the intensities of the transmitted,absorbed, and reflected beams, denoted as and respectively, or (21.4) Radiation intensity, expressed in watts per square meter, corresponds to the energybeing transmitted per unit of time across a unit area that is perpendicular to thedirection of propagation.

Materials that are capable of transmitting light with relatively little absorption and reflection are transparent—one can see through them. Translucent materials are those through which light is transmitted diffusely; that is, light is scattered withinthe interior, to the degree that objects are not clearly distinguishable when viewedthrough a specimen of the material. Materials that are impervious to the transmis-sion of visible light are termed opaque. Bulk metals are opaque throughout the entire visible spectrum; that is, all light radiation is either absorbed or reflected. On the other hand, electrically insulatingmaterials can be made to be transparent. Furthermore, some semiconductingmaterials are transparent whereas others are opaque. 21.4 ATOMIC AND ELECTRONIC INTERACTIONS The optical phenomena that occur within solid materials involve interactions be- tween the electromagnetic radiation and atoms, ions, and/or electrons.

and/or electrons. Two of themost important of these interactions are electronic polarization and electron energytransitions. Electronic Polarization One component of an electromagnetic wave is simply a rapidly fluctuating electricfield (Figure 21.1). For the visible range of frequencies, this electric field interactswith the electron cloud surrounding each atom within its path in such a way as toinduce electronic polarization, or to shift the electron cloud relative to the nucleusof the atom with each change in direction of electric field component, as demon-strated in Figure 18.32 a.Two consequences of this polarization are: (1) some of the radiation energy may be absorbed, and (2) light waves are retarded in velocity asthey pass through the medium. The second consequence is manifested as refraction,a phenomenon to be discussed in Section 21.5. Electron Transitions The absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation may involve electron transitions from one energy state to another. For the sake of this discussion, con-sider an isolated atom, the electron energy diagram for which is represented inFigure 21.3. An electron may be excited from an occupied state at energy to a vacant and higher-lying one, denoted by the absorption of a photon of energy.The change in energy experienced by the electron, depends on the radiation frequency as follows: (21.6) where, again, his Planck’s constant. At this point it is important that several con- cepts be understood. First, since the energy states for the atom are discrete, onlyspecific ’s exist between the energy levels; thus, only photons of frequencies cor-responding to the possible ’s for the atom can be absorbed by electron transi-tions. Furthermore, all of a photon’s energy is absorbed in each excitation event. A second important concept is that a stimulated electron cannot remain in an excited state indefinitely; after a short time, it falls or decays back into its ground state, or unexcited level, with a reemission of electromagnetic radiation.

electromagnetic radiation. Several de- cay paths are possible, and these are discussed later. In any case, there must be aconservation of energy for absorption and emission electron transitions.¢E¢E¢E/H11005hn¢E,E 4,E2118 •Chapter 21 / Optical Properties transparent, translucent opaque For an electron transition, change in energy equals theproduct of Planck’sconstant and thefrequency ofradiation absorbed(or emitted). excited state, ground state1496T_c21_114-142 10/31/05 20:19 Page 118FIRST PAGESAs the ensuing discussions show, the optical characteristics of solid materials that relate to absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation are explained in terms of the electron band structure of the material (possible band structureswere discussed in Section 18.5) and the principles relating to electron transitions,as outlined in the preceding two paragraphs. Optical Properties of Metals Consider the electron energy band schemes for metals as illustrated in Figures 18.4 a and 18.4b; in both cases a high-energy band is only partially filled with electrons. Metals are opaque because the incident radiation having frequencies within the vis-ible range excites electrons into unoccupied energy states above the Fermi energy,as demonstrated in Figure 21.4 a;as a consequence, the incident radiation is ab- sorbed, in accordance with Equation 21.6. Total absorption is within a very thinouter layer, usually less than 0.1 thus only metallic films thinner than 0.1 are capable of transmitting visible light. All frequencies of visible light are absorbed by metals because of the continuously available empty electron states, which permit electron transitions as in Figure 21.4 a.mm mm;21.4 Atomic and Electronic Interactions •119 Electron excitation, ∆E = E4 – E2 = h/H926342 Incident photon of frequency /H926342E1E2E3E4E5EnergyFigure 21.3 For an isolated atom, a schematic illustration of photon absorption by the excitation of an electron from one energystate to another.

Metals are transparent to high-frequency (x- and -ray) radiation. Most of the absorbed radiation is reemitted from the surface in the form of vis- ible light of the same wavelength, which appears as reflected light; an electron tran-sition accompanying reradiation is shown in Figure 21.4 b.The reflectivity for most metals is between 0.90 and 0.95; some small fraction of the energy from electrondecay processes is dissipated as heat. Since metals are opaque and highly reflective, the perceived color is determined by the wavelength distribution of the radiation that is reflected and not absorbed.A bright silvery appearance when exposed to white light indicates that the metalis highly reflective over the entire range of the visible spectrum. In other words, forthe reflected beam, the composition of these reemitted photons, in terms of fre-quency and number, is approximately the same as for the incident beam.

incident beam. Aluminumand silver are two metals that exhibit this reflective behavior. Copper and gold ap-pear red-orange and yellow, respectively, because some of the energy associatedwith light photons having short wavelengths is not reemitted as visible light. Concept Check 21.3 Why are metals transparent to high-frequency X-ray and -ray radiation? [The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] Optical Properties of Nonmetals By virtue of their electron energy band structures, nonmetallic materials may betransparent to visible light. Therefore, in addition to reflection and absorption,refraction and transmission phenomena also need to be considered. 21.5 REFRACTION Light that is transmitted into the interior of transparent materials experiences adecrease in velocity, and, as a result, is bent at the interface; this phenomenon istermed refraction. The index of refraction nof a material is defined as the ratio of the velocity in a vacuum cto the velocity in the medium or (21.7) The magnitude of n (or the degree of bending) will depend on the wavelength of the light. This effect is graphically demonstrated by the familiar dispersion or sep-aration of a beam of white light into its component colors by a glass prism. Eachcolor is deflected by a different amount as it passes into and out of the glass, whichresults in the separation of the colors. Not only does the index of refraction affectthe optical path of light, but also, as explained below, it influences the fraction ofincident light that is reflected at the surface. Just as Equation 21.1 defines the magnitude of c,an equivalent expression gives the velocity of light in a medium as (21.8) v/H110051 1/H9280mvn/H11005c vv,gg120 •Chapter 21 / Optical Properties refraction, index of refraction Definition of index of refraction—theratio of lightvelocities in avacuum and in themedium of interest Velocity of light in amedium, in terms of the medium’selectric permittivityand magneticpermeability1496T_c21_114-142 10/31/05 20:19 Page 120FIRST PAGESwhere and are, respectively, the permittivity and permeability of the particular substance.

Since most substances are only slightly magnetic, and (21.10) Thus, for transparent materials, there is a relation between the index of refraction and the dielectric constant. As already mentioned, the phenomenon of refraction isrelated to electronic polarization (Section 21.4) at the relatively high frequenciesfor visible light; thus, the electronic component of the dielectric constant may bedetermined from index of refraction measurements using Equation 21.10. Since the retardation of electromagnetic radiation in a medium results from electronic polarization, the size of the constituent atoms or ions has a considerableinfluence on the magnitude of this effect—generally, the larger an atom or ion, thegreater will be the electronic polarization, the slower the velocity, and the greaterthe index of refraction. The index of refraction for a typical soda–lime glass is ap-proximately 1.5. Additions of large barium and lead ions (as BaO and PbO) to aglass will increase n significantly. For example, highly leaded glasses containing 90 wt% PbO have an index of refraction of approximately 2.1. For crystalline ceramics that have cubic crystal structures, and for glasses, the index of refraction is independent of crystallographic direction (i.e., it isisotropic). Noncubic crystals, on the other hand, have an anisotropic n;that is, the index is greatest along the directions that have the highest density of ions.Table 21.1 gives refractive indices for several glasses, transparent ceramics, and polymers.

The reflectivity Rrepresents the fraction of the incident light that is reflected at the interface, or (21.11) where and are the intensities of the incident and reflected beams, respectively.If the light is normal (or perpendicular) to the interface, then (21.12) where and are the indices of refraction of the two media. If the incident lightis not normal to the interface, Rwill depend on the angle of incidence. When light is transmitted from a vacuum or air into a solid s,then (21.13) since the index of refraction of air is very nearly unity. Thus, the higher the indexof refraction of the solid, the greater is the reflectivity. For typical silicate glasses,the reflectivity is approximately 0.05. Just as the index of refraction of a solid de-pends on the wavelength of the incident light, so also does the reflectivity vary withwavelength. Reflection losses for lenses and other optical instruments are mini-mized significantly by coating the reflecting surface with very thin layers of dielec-tric materials such as magnesium fluoride (MgF 2). 21.7 ABSORPTION Nonmetallic materials may be opaque or transparent to visible light; and, if trans-parent, they often appear colored. In principle, light radiation is absorbed in thisgroup of materials by two basic mechanisms, which also influence the transmissioncharacteristics of these nonmetals. One of these is electronic polarization (Section21.4). Absorption by electronic polarization is important only at light frequenciesin the vicinity of the relaxation frequency of the constituent atoms.

constituent atoms. The other mech-anism involves valence band-conduction band electron transitions, which dependon the electron energy band structure of the material; band structures for semi-conductors and insulators were discussed in Section 18.5. Absorption of a photon of light may occur by the promotion or excitation of an electron from the nearly filled valence band, across the band gap, and into anempty state within the conduction band, as demonstrated in Figure 21.5 a;a freeR/H11005an s/H110021 ns/H110011b2n2 n1R/H11005an2/H11002n1 n2/H11001n1b2IR I0R/H11005IR I0122 •Chapter 21 / Optical Properties Definition of reflectivity—interms of intensitiesof reflected andincident beams Reflectivity (for normal incidence) atinterface betweentwo media havingindices of refractionof and n 2 n11496T_c21_114-142 10/31/05 20:19 Page 122FIRST PAGESelectron in the conduction band and a hole in the valence band are created. Again, the energy of excitation is related to the absorbed photon frequency throughEquation 21.6. These excitations with the accompanying absorption can take placeonly if the photon energy is greater than that of the band gap —that is, if (21.14) or, in terms of wavelength, (21.15) The minimum wavelength for visible light, (min), is about 0.4 m, and since m/s and eV-s, the maximum band gap energy (max) for which absorption of visible light is possible is just (21.16a) Or, no visible light is absorbed by nonmetallic materials having band gap energiesgreater than about 3.1 eV; these materials, if of high purity, will appear transparentand colorless.

Every nonmetallic material becomes opaque at some wavelength, which de- pends on the magnitude of its For example, diamond, having a band gap of5.6 eV , is opaque to radiation having wavelengths less than about 0.22 Interactions with light radiation can also occur in dielectric solids having wide band gaps, involving other than valence band-conduction band electron transitions. Ifimpurities or other electrically active defects are present, electron levels within theband gap may be introduced, such as the donor and acceptor levels (Section 18.11),except that they lie closer to the center of the band gap. Light radiation of specificwavelengths may be emitted as a result of electron transitions involving these levelswithin the band gap. For example, consider Figure 21.6 a,which shows the valence band- conduction band electron excitation for a material that has one such impurity level.Again, the electromagnetic energy that was absorbed by this electron excitation mustbe dissipated in some manner; several mechanisms are possible. For one, this dissipa-tion may occur via direct electron and hole recombination according to the reaction (21.17) which is represented schematically in Figure 21.5 b.In addition, multiple-step elec- tron transitions may occur, which involve impurity levels lying within the band gap.One possibility, as indicated in Figure 21.6 b,is the emission of two photons; one is emitted as the electron drops from a state in the conduction band to the impuritylevel, the other as it decays back into the valence band. Alternatively, one of thetransitions may involve the generation of a phonon (Figure 21.6 c), wherein the associated energy is dissipated in the form of heat.

back faces. The derivation of Equation 21.19 is left as a homework problem. Thus, the fraction of incident light that is transmitted through a transparent ma- terial depends on the losses that are incurred by absorption and reflection. Again, thesum of the reflectivity R ,absorptivity A,and transmissivity T ,is unity according to Equation 21.5. Also, each of the variables R,A,and Tdepends on light wavelength. This is demonstrated over the visible region of the spectrum for a green glass in Fig- ure 21.8. For example, for light having a wavelength of 0.4 m, the fractions transmitted,absorbed, and reflected are approximately 0.90, 0.05, and 0.05, respectively. However,at 0.55 m, the respective fractions have shifted to about 0.50, 0.48, and 0.02. 21.9 COLOR Transparent materials appear colored as a consequence of specific wavelength ranges of light that are selectively absorbed; the color discerned is a result of the combination of wavelengths that are transmitted. If absorption is uniform for allvisible wavelengths, the material appears colorless; examples include high-purityinorganic glasses and high-purity and single-crystal diamonds and sapphire. Usually, any selective absorption is by electron excitation. One such situation involves semiconducting materials that have band gaps within the range of photonenergies for visible light (1.8 to 3.1 eV). Thus, the fraction of the visible light hav-ing energies greater than is selectively absorbed by valence band–conductionband electron transitions. Of course, some of this absorbed radiation is reemittedas the excited electrons drop back into their original, lower-lying energy states. Itis not necessary that this reemission occur at the same frequency as that of theabsorption. As a result, the color depends on the frequency distribution of bothtransmitted and reemitted light beams.E gmm126 •Chapter 21 / Optical Properties Figure 21.7 The transmission of light through a transparent medium for which there is reflection at front and back faces, as well as absorption within the medium.

Nonabsorbed visible light consists of pho-tons having energies between about 1.8 and 2.4 eV . Cadmium sulfide takes on ayellow-orange color because of the composition of the transmitted beam. With insulator ceramics, specific impurities also introduce electron levels within the forbidden band gap, as discussed above.

discussed above. Photons having energies less than theband gap may be emitted as a consequence of electron decay processes involvingimpurity atoms or ions as demonstrated in Figures 21.6 band 21.6c. Again, the color of the material is a function of the distribution of wavelengths that is found in thetransmitted beam. For example, high-purity and single-crystal aluminum oxide or sapphire is col- orless. Ruby, which has a brilliant red color, is simply sapphire to which has beenadded 0.5 to 2% of chromium oxide (Cr 2O3). The Cr3+ion substitutes for the Al3+ ion in the Al 2O3crystal structure and, furthermore, introduces impurity levels within the wide energy band gap of the sapphire. Light radiation is absorbed by valenceband-conduction band electron transitions, some of which is then reemitted at spe-cific wavelengths as a consequence of electron transitions to and from these impu-rity levels. The transmittance as a function of wavelength for sapphire and ruby ispresented in Figure 21.9. For the sapphire, transmittance is relatively constant withwavelength over the visible spectrum, which accounts for the colorlessness of thismaterial. However, strong absorption peaks (or minima) occur for the ruby, one inthe blue-violet region (at about 0.4 m), and the other for yellow-green light (atabout 0.6 m). That nonabsorbed or transmitted light mixed with reemitted lightimparts to ruby its deep-red color. Inorganic glasses are colored by incorporating transition or rare earth ions while the glass is still in the molten state. Representative color–ion pairs include Cu 2/H11001, blue-green; Co2/H11001,blue-violet; Cr3/H11001,green; Mn2/H11001,yellow; and Mn3/H11001,purple.

Many dielectric materials that are intrinsically transparent may be madetranslucent or even opaque because of interior reflection and refraction. A trans-mitted light beam is deflected in direction and appears diffuse as a result of multi-ple scattering events. Opacity results when the scattering is so extensive that virtuallynone of the incident beam is transmitted, undeflected, to the back surface. This internal scattering may result from several different sources. Polycrystalline specimens in which the index of refraction is anisotropic normally appear translucent.Both reflection and refraction occur at grain boundaries, which causes a diversion inthe incident beam.This results from a slight difference in index of refraction nbetween adjacent grains that do not have the same crystallographic orientation.

crystallographic orientation. Scattering of light also occurs in two-phase materials in which one phase is finely dispersed within the other. Again, the beam dispersion occurs across phaseboundaries when there is a difference in the refractive index for the two phases;the greater this difference, the more efficient is the scattering. Glass–ceramics (Sec-tion 13.3), which may consist of both crystalline and residual glass phases, will appearhighly transparent if the sizes of the crystallites are smaller than the wavelength ofvisible light, and when the indices of refraction of the two phases are nearly iden-tical (which is possible by adjustment of composition). As a consequence of fabrication or processing, many ceramic pieces contain some residual porosity in the form of finely dispersed pores. These pores alsoeffectively scatter light radiation. Figure 21.10 demonstrates the difference in optical transmission characteristics of single-crystal, fully dense polycrystalline, and porous ( /H110115% porosity) aluminum oxide specimens. Whereas the single crystal is totally transparent, polycrystallineand porous materials are, respectively, translucent and opaque. For intrinsic polymers (without additives and impurities), the degree of translu- cency is influenced primarily by the extent of crystallinity. Some scattering of visiblelight occurs at the boundaries between crystalline and amorphous regions, again asa result of different indices of refraction. For highly crystalline specimens, this degreeof scattering is extensive, which leads to translucency, and, in some instances, evenopacity. Highly amorphous polymers are completely transparent.128 •Chapter 21 / Optical Properties Figure 21.10 Photograph showing the light transmittance of three aluminum oxide specimens.

Photons of emitted light are generated from electron transitions in the solid. Energy is absorbed when an electron is promotedto an excited energy state; visible light is emitted when it falls back to a lower energystate if 1.8 3.1 eV . The absorbed energy may be supplied as higher- energy electromagnetic radiation (causing valence band–conduction band transi-tions, Figure 21.6a) such as ultraviolet light, or other sources such as high energyelectrons, or by heat, mechanical, or chemical energy. Furthermore, luminescence isclassified according to the magnitude of the delay time between absorption and ree-mission events. If reemission occurs for times much less than one second, the phe-nomenon is termed fluorescence; for longer times, it is called phosphorescence. A number of materials can be made to fluoresce or phosphoresce; these include somesulfides, oxides, tungstates, and a few organic materials. Ordinarily, pure materialsdo not display these phenomena, and to induce them, impurities in controlledconcentrations must be added. Luminescence has a number of commercial applications. Fluorescent lamps con- sist of a glass housing, coated on the inside with specially prepared tungstates orsilicates. Ultraviolet light is generated within the tube from a mercury glow dis-charge, which causes the coating to fluoresce and emit white light. The pictureviewed on a television screen (cathode ray tube screen) is the product of lumines-cence.The inside of the screen is coated with a material that fluoresces as an electronbeam inside the picture tube very rapidly traverses the screen.

the screen. Detection of x-raysand -rays is also possible; certain phosphors emit visible light or glow whenintroduced into a beam of the radiation that is otherwise invisible. 21.12 PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY The conductivity of semiconducting materials depends on the number of free electrons in the conduction band and also the number of holes in the valenceband, according to Equation 18.13. Thermal energy associated with lattice vi-brations can promote electron excitations in which free electrons and/or holesare created, as described in Section 18.6. Additional charge carriers may begenerated as a consequence of photon-induced electron transitions in which lightis absorbed; the attendant increase in conductivity is called photoconductivity. Thus, when a specimen of a photoconductive material is illuminated, the con- ductivity increases. This phenomenon is utilized in photographic light meters. A photoinduced current is measured, and its magnitude is a direct function of the intensity of theincident light radiation, or the rate at which the photons of light strike the photo-conductive material. Of course, visible light radiation must induce electronic tran-sitions in the photoconductive material; cadmium sulfide is commonly utilized inlight meters. Sunlight may be directly converted into electrical energy in solar cells, which also employ semiconductors.The operation of these devices is, in a sense, the reverseof that for the light-emitting diode. A p–n junction is used in which photoexcited electrons and holes are drawn away from the junction, in opposite directions, andbecome part of an external current.geV6hn621.12 Photoconductivity •129 luminescence fluorescence phosphorescence photoconductivity1496T_c21_114-142 10/31/05 20:19 Page 129FIRST PAGES130 •Chapter 21 / Optical Properties Light-Emitting DiodesMATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE In Section 18.15 we discussed semiconductor p-n junctions, and how they may be used as diodes or as rectifiers of an electric current.1Further- more, in some situations, when a forward-biased potential of relatively high magnitude is appliedacross a p-n junction diode, visible light (or in- frared radiation) will be emitted.

be emitted. This conversionof electrical energy into light energy is termedelectroluminescence, and the device that produces it is termed a light-emitting diode (LED). The forward-biased potential attracts electrons onthe n-side toward the junction, where some of them pass into (or are “injected” into) the p-side (Figure 21.11 a). Here, the electrons are minority charge carriers, and as such, they “recombine” with, or are annihilated by the holes in the region nearthe junction, according to Equation 21.17, wherethe energy is in the form of photons of light(Figure 21.11 b). An analogous process occurs on the p-side—i.e., holes travel to the junction, and recombine with the majority electrons on then-side. The elemental semiconductors, silicon and germanium, are not suitable for LEDs due to thedetailed natures of their band gap structures.Rather, some of the III-V semiconducting com-pounds such as gallium arsenide (GaAs), indiumphosphide (InP), and alloys composed of thesematerials (i.e., where x is a small number less than unity) are frequently used. Fur-thermore, the wavelength (i.e., color) of the emit-ted radiation is related to the band gap of thesemiconductor (which is the normally the samefor both n - and p -sides of the diode). For exam- ple, red, orange, and yellow colors are possiblefor the GaAs–InP system. And, blue and greenLEDs have been developed using (Ga, In)Nsemiconducting alloys.

Electronic remote con-trols (for televisions, DVD players, etc.) also em-ploy LEDs that emit an infrared beam; this beamtransmits coded signals that are picked up by de-tectors in the receiving devices. In addition, LEDsare now being used for light sources. They aremore energy efficient than incandescent lights,generate very little heat, and have much longerlifetimes (since there is no filament that can burnout). Most new traffic control signals use LEDsinstead of incandescent lights.

As a consequence, light-emitting diodes made of polymers are possible, of which there are two types: (1) organic light-emitting diodes (or OLEDs), which have relatively low molecular weights; and (2) the high molecular-weightpolymer light-emitting diodes (or PLEDs).

(or PLEDs). For these LED types, amorphous polymers are usedin the form of thin layers that are sandwichedtogether with electrical contacts (anodes andcathodes). In order for the light to be emitted fromthe LED, one of the contacts must be transparent.Figure 21.12 is a schematic illustration that shows the components and configuration of an OLED.A wide variety of colors is possible using OLEDsand PLEDs, and, in fact, more than a single colormay be produced from each device (such is notpossible with semiconductor LEDs)—thus, com-bining colors makes it possible to generate whitelight. Although the semiconductor LEDs currently have longer lifetimes than these organic emitters,OLEDs/PLEDs have distinct advantages. Inaddition to generating multiple colors, they areeasier to fabricate (by “printing” onto their sub-strates with an ink jet printer), are relativelyinexpensive, have slimmer profiles, and can bepatterned to give high-resolution and full-colorimages.

These transition events occur independently of one another and at randomtimes, producing radiation that is incoherent; that is, the light waves are out of phasewith one another. With lasers, however, coherent light is generated by electron tran-sitions initiated by an external stimulus; in fact, “laser” is just the acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Although there are several different varieties of laser, the principles of opera- tion are explained using the solid-state ruby laser. Ruby is simply a single crystalof (sapphire) to which has been added on the order of 0.05% ions. Aspreviously explained (Section 21.9), these ions impart to ruby its characteristic redcolor; more important, they provide electron states that are essential for the laserto function. The ruby laser is in the form of a rod, the ends of which are flat, par-allel, and highly polished. Both ends are silvered such that one is totally reflectingand the other partially transmitting. The ruby is illuminated with light from a xenon flash lamp (Figure 21.13).

(Figure 21.13). Be- fore this exposure, virtually all the ions are in their ground states; that is,electrons fill the lowest energy levels, as represented schematically in Figure 21.14.However, photons of wavelength from the xenon lamp excite electronsfrom the ions into higher energy states. These electrons can decay back intotheir ground state by two different paths. Some fall back directly; associated pho-ton emissions are not part of the laser beam. Other electrons decay into a metastableintermediate state (path EM,F igure 24.14), where they may reside for up to 3 ms (milliseconds) before spontaneous emission (path MG). In terms of electronicprocesses, 3 ms is a relatively long time, which means that a large number of thesemetastable states may become occupied. This situation is indicated in Figure 21.15 b. The initial spontaneous photon emission by a few of these electrons is the stimulus that triggers an avalanche of emissions from the remaining electrons inCr 3/H110010.56 mmCr3/H11001Cr3/H11001Al2O3132 •Chapter 21 / Optical Properties laser Flash lamp Coherent beam Power sourceRubyFigure 21.13 Schematic diagram of the ruby laser and xenon flash lamp.

That is, from a modification of Equation 21.3, namely (21.20) must lie between 0.4 and 0.7 m. A voltage applied to the material excites elec- trons from the valence band, across the band gap, and into the conduction band; correspondingly, holes are created in the valence band.This process is demonstratedin Figure 21.16a, which shows the energy band scheme over some region of the semiconducting material, along with several holes and excited electrons. Subse-quently, a few of these excited electrons and holes spontaneously recombine. Foreach recombination event, a photon of light having a wavelength given by Equa-tion 21.20 is emitted (Figure 21.16 a). One such photon will stimulate the recombi- nation of other excited electron–hole pairs, Figure 21.16 b–f, and the production of additional photons that have the same wavelength and are all in phase with one an-other and with the original photon; thus, a monochromatic and coherent beam re-sults.

The other end of the laser is partiallyreflecting, which allows for some of the beam to escape. Furthermore, with this typeof laser, a continuous beam is produced inasmuch as a constant applied voltageensures that there is always a steady source of holes and excited electrons. The semiconductor laser is composed of several layers of semiconducting ma- terials that have different compositions and are sandwiched between a heat sink anda metal conductor; a typical arrangement is represented schematically in Figure 21.17.The compositions of the layers are chosen so as to confine both the excited elec- trons and holes as well as the laser beam to within the central gallium arsenide layer.

Since laser beams may be focused to produce localized heating, they are used in some surgical procedures and for cutting, welding, andmachining metals. Lasers are also used as light sources for optical communicationsystems. Furthermore, because the beam is highly coherent, they may be utilizedfor making very precise distance measurements. 21.14 OPTICAL FIBERS IN COMMUNICATIONS The communications field has recently experienced a revolution with the develop- ment of optical fiber technology; at present, virtually all telecommunications aretransmitted via this medium rather than through copper wires. Signal transmissionthrough a metallic wire conductor is electronic (i.e., by electrons), whereas usingoptically transparent fibers, signal transmission is photonic, meaning that it uses photons of electromagnetic or light radiation. Use of fiber-optic systems has im-proved speed of transmission, information density, and transmission distance, witha reduction in error rate; furthermore, there is no electromagnetic interference withfiber optics.

withfiber optics. With regard to speed, optical fibers can transmit, in one second, infor-mation equivalent to three episodes of your favorite television program. Or rela-tive to information density, two small optical fibers can transmit the equivalentof 24,000 telephone calls simultaneously. Furthermore, it would require 30,000 kg(33 tons) of copper to transmit the same amount of information as only 0.1 kg of optical fiber material. The present treatment will center on the characteristics of optical fibers; how- ever, it is thought worthwhile to first briefly discuss the components and operationof the transmission system. A schematic diagram showing these components is pre-sented in Figure 21.18. The information (i.e., telephone conversation) in electronicform must first be digitized into bits, that is, 1’s and 0’s; this is accomplished in theencoder. It is next necessary to convert this electrical signal into an optical (pho-tonic) one, which takes place in the electrical-to-optical converter (Figure 21.18).This converter is normally a semiconductor laser, as described in the previous( 1 4lbm)136 •Chapter 21 / Optical Properties Table 21.2 Characteristics and Applications of Several Types of Lasers Common Max.

coherent light. The wavelength normally lies between 0.78 and 1.6 which is in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum; absorption losses are low within this range of wavelengths. The outputfrom this laser converter is in the form of pulses of light; a binary 1 is representedby a high-power pulse (Figure 21.19 a), whereas a 0 corresponds to a low-power pulse (or the absence of one), Figure 21.19 b.These photonic pulse signals are then fed into and carried through the fiber-optical cable (sometimes called a “waveguide”) to thereceiving end. For long transmissions, repeaters may be required; these are devicesthat amplify and regenerate the signal. Finally, at the receiving end the photonic sig-nal is reconverted to an electronic one, and is then decoded (undigitized). The heart of this communication system is the optical fiber. It must guide these light pulses over long distances without significant signal power loss (i.e., attenua-tion) and pulse distortion. Fiber components are the core, cladding, and coating;these are represented in the cross-section profile, Figure 21.20. The signal passesthrough the core, whereas the surrounding cladding constrains the light rays to travelwithin the core; the outer coating protects core and cladding from damage thatmight result from abrasion and external pressures. High-purity silica glass is used as the fiber material; fiber diameters normally range between about 5 and 100 The fibers are relatively flaw free and, thus, re-markably strong; during production the continuous fibers are tested to ensure thatthey meet minimum strength standards. Containment of the light to within the fiber core is made possible by total in- ternal reflection; that is, any light rays traveling at oblique angles to the fiber axisare reflected back into the core. Internal reflection is accomplished by varying theindex of refraction of the core and cladding glass materials.

glass materials. In this regard, two designtypes are employed. With one type (termed “step-index”), the index of refractionmm.mm,21.1 4O ptical Fibers in Communications •137 Output signalEncoderElectrical/ Optical ConverterOptical/ Electrical ConverterRepeaterFiber optic cable Decoder Figure 21.18 Schematic diagram showing the components of an optical fiber communications system.

Pulse broad-ening results because various light rays, although being injected at approximatelythe same instant, arrive at the output at different times; they traverse different tra-jectories and, thus, have a variety of path lengths. Pulse broadening is largely avoided by utilization of the other or “graded-index” design. Here, impurities such as boron oxide ( ) or germanium dioxide ( )are added to the silica glass such that the index of refraction is made to vary par-abolically across the cross section (Figure 21.22 b). Thus, the velocity of light within the core varies with radial position, being greater at the periphery than the outerperiphery of the core travel faster in this lower-index material, and arrive at theoutput at approximately the same time as undeviated rays that pass through thecenter portion of the core.

Impuritiesand other defects that absorb, scatter, and thus attenuate the light beam must beeliminated. The presence of copper, iron, and vanadium is especially detrimental;their concentrations are reduced to on the order of several parts per billion. Like-wise, water and hydroxyl contaminant contents are extremely low. Uniformity offiber cross-sectional dimensions and core roundness are critical; tolerances of theseparameters to within a micrometer over 1 km (0.6 mile) of length are possible. Inaddition, bubbles within the glass and surface defects have been virtually elimi-nated. The attenuation of light in this glass material is imperceptibly small.

SUMMARY Electromagnetic RadiationLight Interactions with Solids The optical behavior of a solid material is a function of its interactions with elec- tromagnetic radiation having wavelengths within the visible region of the spectrum.

the spectrum. Possible interactive phenomena include refraction, reflection, absorption, and trans- mission of incident light. Optical Properties of Metals Metals appear opaque as a result of the absorption and then reemission of light ra- diation within a thin outer surface layer. Absorption occurs via the excitation ofelectrons from occupied energy states to unoccupied ones above the Fermi energylevel. Reemission takes place by decay electron transitions in the reverse direction.The perceived color of a metal is determined by the spectral composition of the reflected light. Atomic and Electronic Interactions Refraction Light radiation experiences refraction in transparent materials; that is, its velocityis retarded and the light beam is bent at the interface. Index of refraction is the ra-tio of the velocity of light in a vacuum to that in the particular medium. The phe-nomenon of refraction is a consequence of electronic polarization of the atoms orions, which is induced by the electric field component of the light wave. Reflection When light passes from one transparent medium to another having a different in- dex of refraction, some of it is reflected at the interface.The degree of the reflectance depends on the indices of refraction of both media, as well as the angle of incidence.Summary •139Intensity Time (c) (d) (a) (b) Intensity Time (e)Cladding Core Radial position Index of refractionOutput impulseInput impulse Figure 21.22 Graded-index optical fiber design.

or opaque. Opacity results in relatively narrow-band gap materials as a result of absorption whereby a pho-ton’s energy is sufficient to promote valence band-conduction band electron tran-sitions. Transparent nonmetals have band gaps greater than about 3 eV . Some light absorption occurs in even transparent materials as a consequence of electronic polarization. Color For wide-band gap insulators that contain impurities, decay processes involving ex- cited electrons to states within the band gap are possible with the emission of pho- tons having energies less than the band gap energy. These materials appear colored,and the color depends on the distribution of wavelength ranges in the transmittedbeam. Opacity and Translucency in Insulators Normally transparent materials may be made translucent or even opaque if the in- cident light beam experiences interior reflection and/or refraction.Translucency andopacity as a result of internal scattering may occur, (1) in polycrystalline materialsthat have an anisotropic index of refraction, (2) in two-phase materials, (3) inmaterials containing small pores, and (4) in highly crystalline polymers. Luminescence PhotoconductivityLasers Three other important optical phenomena were discussed: luminescence, photo- conductivity, and light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (lasers). With luminescence, energy is absorbed as a consequence of electron excitations, which is reemitted as visible light. The electrical conductivity of some semiconduc-tors may be enhanced by photoinduced electron transitions, whereby additional freeelectrons and holes are generated. Coherent and high-intensity light beams areproduced in lasers by stimulated electron transitions. Optical Fibers in Communications This chapter concluded with a discussion of the use of optical fibers in our modern telecommunications. Using fiber-optic technology, transmission of information is interference free, rapid, and intense.140 •Chapter 21 / Optical Properties IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS AbsorptionColorElectroluminescenceExcited stateFluorescenceGround stateIndex of refractionLaserLight-emitting diode (LED)LuminescenceOpaquePhosphorescencePhotoconductivityPhotonPlanck’s constantReflectionRefractionTranslucent Transmission Transparent1496T_c21_114-142 10/31/05 20:19 Page 140FIRST PAGESQuestions and Problems •141 REFERENCES Azaroff, L.V ., and J.

Perhaps one of the most important tasks that an engineer may be called upon to perform is that of materials selection with regard to component design.Inappropriate or improper decisions can be disastrousfrom both economic and safety perspectives. There-fore, it is essential that the engineering student be-come familiar with and versed in the procedures andprotocols that are normally employed in this process.This chapter discusses materials selection issues inseveral contexts and from various perspectives.WHY STUDY Materials Selection and Design Considerations?

Of late, there has been a trend to emphasize the ele-ment of design in engineering pedagogy.

engineering pedagogy. To a materials scientist or materials engi- neer, design can be taken in several contexts. First of all, it can mean designing newmaterials having unique property combinations. Alternatively, design can involveselecting a new material having a better combination of characteristics for a specificapplication; choice of material cannot be made without consideration of necessarymanufacturing processes (i.e., forming, welding, etc. ), which also rely on materialproperties. Or, finally, design might mean developing a process for producing amaterial having better properties. One particularly effective technique for teaching design principles is the case study method. With this technique, the solutions to real-life engineering problemsare carefully analyzed in detail so that the student may observe the procedures andrationale that are involved in the decision-making process. We have chosen to per-form six case studies, which draw upon principles that were introduced in previouschapters. Five of these studies involve materials that are used for the following: (1)a torsionally stressed cylindrical shaft (materials selection); (2) an automobile valvespring; (3) the artificial total hip replacement; (4) chemical protective clothing; and(5) integrated circuit packages. The remaining case study discusses the probablecause of failure of an automobile rear axle. Materials Selection for a Torsionally Stressed Cylindrical Shaft We begin by addressing the design process from the perspective of materials selection; that is, for some application, selecting a material having a desirableor optimum property or combination of properties. Elements of this materials1496T_c22_143-191 11/3/05 20:07 Page 144FIRST PAGESselection process involve deciding on the constraints of the problem, and, from these, establishing criteria that can be used in materials selection to maximizeperformance. The component or structural element we have chosen to discuss is a solid cylin- drical shaft that is subjected to a torsional stress. Strength of the shaft will be con-sidered in detail, and criteria will be developed for the maximization of strengthwith respect to both minimum material mass and minimum cost.

minimum cost. Other parametersand properties that may be important in this selection process are also discussedbriefly. 22.2 STRENGTH CONSIDERATIONS— TORSIONALLY STRESSED SHAFT For this portion of the design problem, we will establish a criterion for selection of light and strong materials for this shaft. It will be assumed that the twisting mo-ment and length of the shaft are specified, whereas the radius (or cross-sectionalarea) may be varied. We develop an expression for the mass of material requiredin terms of twisting moment, shaft length, and density and strength of the material.Using this expression, it will be possible to evaluate the performance–that is, max-imize the strength of this torsionally stressed shaft with respect to mass and, inaddition, relative to material cost. Consider the cylindrical shaft of length L and radius r, as shown in Figure 22.1. The application of twisting moment (or torque) produces an angle of twist Shear stress at radius ris defined by the equation (22.1) Here, Jis the polar moment of inertia, which for a solid cylinder is (22.2) Thus, (22.3) A safe design calls for the shaft to be able to sustain some twisting moment with-out fracture.

material mass. The mass mof any given quantity of material is just the product of its density and volume. Since the volume of a cylinder is just then (22.5) or, the radius of the shaft in terms of its mass is just (22.6) Substitution of this r expression into Equation 22.4 leads to (22.7) Solving this expression for the mass myields (22.8) The parameters on the right-hand side of this equation are grouped into three sets of parentheses.Those contained within the first set (i.e., Nand ) relate to the safe func- tioning of the shaft.Within the second parentheses is L ,a geometric parameter. Finally, the material properties of density and strength are contained within the last set. The upshot of Equation 22.8 is that the best materials to be used for a light shaft that can safely sustain a specified twisting moment are those having low ratios. In terms of material suitability, it is sometimes preferable to work with whatis termed a performance index, P, which is just the reciprocal of this ratio; that is, (22.9) In this context we want to utilize a material having a large performance index. At this point it becomes necessary to examine the performance indices of a va- riety of potential materials. This procedure is expedited by the utilization of whatare termed materials selection charts. 1These are plots of the values of one material property versus those of another property. Both axes are scaled logarithmically andusually span about five orders of magnitude, so as to include the properties of vir-tually all materials. For example, for our problem, the chart of interest is logarithmof strength versus logarithm of density, which is shown in Figure 22.2. 2It may be noted on this plot that materials of a particular type (e.g., woods, engineering poly-mers, etc.) cluster together and are enclosed within an envelope delineated with abold line.

These include wood products, some plastics, anumber of engineering alloys, the engineering composites, and glasses and engi-neering ceramics. On the basis of fracture toughness considerations, the engineer-ing ceramics and glasses are ruled out as possibilities. Let us now impose a further constraint on the problem—namely, that the strength of the shaft must equal or exceed 300 MPa (43,500 psi). This may be repre-sented on the materials selection chart by a horizontal line constructed at 300 MPa,Figure 22.3. Now the search region is further restricted to that area above both of these lines. Thus, all wood products, all engineering polymers, other engineering al-loys (viz. Mg and some Al alloys), as well as some engineering composites are elim-inated as candidates; steels, titanium alloys, high-strength aluminum alloys, and theengineering composites remain as possibilities. At this point we are in a position to evaluate and compare the strength per- formance behavior of specific materials. Table 22.1 presents the density, strength,and strength performance index for three engineering alloys and two engineeringcomposites, which were deemed acceptable candidates from the analysis using thematerials selection chart.

selection chart. In this table, strength was taken as 0.6 times the tensileyield strength (for the alloys) and 0.6 times the tensile strength (for the compos-ites); these approximations were necessary since we are concerned with strength intorsion and torsional strengths are not readily available. Furthermore, for the twoengineering composites, it is assumed that the continuous and aligned glass and car-bon fibers are wound in a helical fashion (Figure 16.15), and at a angle refer-enced to the shaft axis. The five materials in Table 22.1 are ranked according tostrength performance index, from highest to lowest: carbon fiber-reinforced andglass fiber-reinforced composites, followed by aluminum, titanium, and 4340 steelalloys. Material cost is another important consideration in the selection process. In real-life engineering situations, economics of the application often is the overridingissue and normally will dictate the material of choice. One way to determine ma-terials cost is by taking the product of the price (on a per-unit mass basis) and therequired mass of material. Cost considerations for these five remaining candidate materials—steel, alu- minum, and titanium alloys, and two engineering composites—are presented in45/H1103422.2 Strength Considerations—Torsionally Stressed Shaft •149 Table 22.1 Density (/H9267), Strength (/H9270 f), and Performance Index (P) for Five Engineering Materials /H9267/H9270 f /H9270f2/H208623//H9267/H11549 P Material (Mg/m3)( MPa)[ ( MPa)2/H208623m3/Mg] Carbon fiber-reinforced composite 1.5 1140 72.8 (0.65 fiber fraction)a Glass fiber-reinforced composite 2.0 1060 52.0 (0.65 fiber fraction)a Aluminum alloy (2024-T6) 2.8 300 16.0 Titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) 4.4 525 14.8 4340 Steel (oil-quenched 7.8 780 10.9 and tempered) aThe fibers in these composites are continuous, aligned, and wound in a helical fashion at a angle relative to the shaft axis.45/H110341496T_c22_143-191 11/3/05 20:07 Page 149FIRST PAGESTable 22.2.

PAGESTable 22.2. In the first column is tabulated The next column lists the ap- proximate relative cost, denoted as this parameter is simply the per-unit mass cost of material divided by the per-unit mass cost for low-carbon steel, one of thecommon engineering materials. The underlying rationale for using is that whilethe price of a specific material will vary over time, the price ratio between thatmaterial and another will, most likely, change more slowly. Finally, the right-hand column of Table 22.2 shows the product of and This product provides a comparison of these several materials on the basis of the cost of materials for a cylindrical shaft that would not fracture in response to the twistingmoment We use this product inasmuch as is proportional to the mass ofmaterial required (Equation 22.8) and is the relative cost on a per-unit mass ba-sis. Now the most economical is the 4340 steel, followed by the glass fiber-reinforcedcomposite, 2024-T6 aluminum, the carbon fiber-reinforced composite, and the tita-nium alloy. Thus, when the issue of economics is considered, there is a significantalteration within the ranking scheme. For example, inasmuch as the carbon fiber-reinforced composite is relatively expensive, it is significantly less desirable; in otherwords, the higher cost of this material may not outweigh the enhanced strength itprovides. 22.3 OTHER PROPERTY CONSIDERATIONS AND THE FINAL DECISION To this point in our materials selection process we have considered only the strength of materials. Other properties relative to the performance of the cylindrical shaftmay be important—for example, stiffness, and, if the shaft rotates, fatigue behavior(Sections 8.7 and 8.8). Furthermore, fabrication costs should also be considered; inour analysis they have been neglected. Relative to stiffness, a stiffness-to-mass performance analysis similar to that above could be conducted.

Automobile Valve Spring 22.4 MECHANICS OF SPRING DEFORMATION The basic function of a spring is to store mechanical energy as it is initially elasti- cally deformed and then recoup this energy at a later time as the spring recoils. Inthis section helical springs that are used in mattresses and in retractable pens andas suspension springs in automobiles are discussed. A stress analysis will be con-ducted on this type of spring, and the results will then be applied to a valve springthat is utilized in automobile engines. Consider the helical spring shown in Figure 22.4, which has been constructed of wire having a circular cross section of diameter d;the coil center-to-center di- ameter is denoted as D.T he application of a compressive force Fcauses a twisting force, or moment, denoted T, as shown in the figure.A combination of shear stresses result, the sum of which, is (22.12) where is a force-independent constant that is a function of the ratio: (22.13) In response to the force F,the coiled spring will experience deflection, which will be assumed to be totally elastic.

The amount of deflection per coil of spring,as indicated in Figure 22.5, is given by the expression (22.14) d c/H110058FD3 d4Gdc,Kw/H110051.60 aD db/H110020.140D/H11408d Kwt/H110058FD pd3Kwt,22.4 Mechanics of Spring Deformation •151 D FF TdFigure 22.4 Schematic diagram of a helical spring showing the twisting momentTthat results from the compressive force F.

Functionally, springs of this type permit both intake andexhaust valves to alternately open and close as the engine is in operation. Rotationof the camshaft causes a valve to open and its spring to be compressed, so that theload on the spring is increased.

is increased. The stored energy in the spring then forces thevalve to close as the camshaft continues its rotation. This process occurs for eachvalve for each engine cycle, and over the lifetime of the engine it occurs many mil-lions of times. Furthermore, during normal engine operation, the temperature ofthe springs is approximately 80 /H11034C (175/H11034F).t y7dcGd pD2Kwtyt/H11005dcGd pD2KwF/H11005d4dcG 8D3dc/H11005ds NcNcds, dc152 •Chapter 22 / Materials Selection and Design Considerations D 2D 2 (a)D 2F (b)c/H9254 Figure 22.5 Schematic diagrams of one coil of a helical spring, ( a) prior to being compressed, and (b) showing the deflection produced from the compressive force F.

Figure 22.7 Photograph of a typical automobile valve spring.1496T_c22_143-191 11/3/05 20:07 Page 153FIRST PAGESwhich, from Equation 22.15, gives an installed deflection per coil of in./coil (1.5 mm/coil) The cam lift is 0.30 in. (7.6 mm), which means that when the cam completely opens a valve, the spring experiences a maximum total deflection equal to the sum of the valve lift and the compressed deflection, namely, (13.7 mm). Hence, the maximum deflection per coil, is in./coil (3.4 mm/coil) Thus, we have available all of the parameters in Equation 22.18 (taking ), except for the required shear yield strength of the spring material. However, the material parameter of interest is really not inasmuch as the spring is continually stress cycled as the valve opens and closes during engineoperation; this necessitates designing against the possibility of failure by fatiguerather than against the possibility of yielding. This fatigue complication is han-dled by choosing a metal alloy that has a fatigue limit (Figure 8.19 a) that is greater than the cyclic stress amplitude to which the spring will be subjected. For thisreason, steel alloys, which have fatigue limits, are normally employed for valvesprings. When using steel alloys in spring design, two assumptions may be made if the stress cycle is reversed (if where is the mean stress, or, equivalently, if in accordance with Equation 8.14 and as noted in Figure 22.8).The first of these assumptions is that the fatigue limit of the alloy (expressed as stressamplitude) is 45,000 psi (310 MPa), the threshold of which occurs at about cy-cles.

about cy-cles. Secondly, for torsion and on the basis of experimental data, it has been foundthat the fatigue strength at cycles is 0.67 TS,w h e re TSis the tensile strength of the material (as measured from a pure tension test). The S–N fatigue diagram (i.e., stress amplitude versus logarithm of the number of cycles to failure) for these alloysis shown in Figure 22.9. Now let us estimate the number of cycles to which a typical valve spring may be subjected in order to determine whether it is permissible to operate within thefatigue limit regime of Figure 22.9 (i.e., if the number of cycles exceeds ). Forthe sake of argument, assume that the automobile in which the spring is mountedtravels a minimum of 100,000 miles (161,000 km) at an average speed of 40 mph(64.4 km/h), with an average engine speed of 3000 rpm (rev/min). The total timeit takes the automobile to travel this distance is 2500 h (100,000 mi/40 mph), or10 6103106tmax/H11005/H11002tmin,tm tm/H110050,tyty,dc/H11005dmcdmc/H110050.54 in. 4 coils/H110050.135dmc,0.30 in. /H110010.24 in. /H110050.54 in.dic/H110050.24 in. 4 coils/H110050.060dic154 •Chapter 22 / Materials Selection and Design Considerations TimeStress max 0 min/H9270/H9270Figure 22.8 Stress versus time for a reversed cycle in shear.1496T_c22_143-191 11/3/05 20:07 Page 154FIRST PAGES150,000 min. At 3000 rpm, the total number of revolutions is (3000 rev/min)(150,000 min) rev, and since there are 2 rev/cycle, the total number of cycles is This result means that we may use the fatigue limit as the design stress inasmuch as the limit cycle threshold has been exceeded for the 100,000-miledistance of travel (i.e., since cycles cycles).

cycles cycles). Furthermore, this problem is complicated by the fact that the stress cycle is not completely reversed (i.e., ) inasmuch as between minimum and maxi-mum deflections the spring remains in compression; thus, the 45,000 psi (310 MPa)fatigue limit is not valid. What we would now like to do is first to make an ap-propriate extrapolation of the fatigue limit for this case and then computeand compare with this limit the actual stress amplitude for the spring; if the stressamplitude is significantly below the extrapolated limit, then the spring design issatisfactory. A reasonable extrapolation of the fatigue limit for this situation may be made using the following expression (termed Goodman’s law): (22.19) where is the fatigue limit for the mean stress is the fatigue limit for [i.e., 45,000 psi (310 MPa)]; and, again, TSis the tensile strength of the alloy. To determine the new fatigue limit from the above expression necessi-tates the computation of both the tensile strength of the alloy and the mean stressfor the spring. 22.6 ONE COMMONLY EMPLOYED STEEL ALLOY One common spring alloy is an ASTM 232 chrome–vanadium steel, having a com-position of 0.48–0.53 wt% C, 0.80–1.10 wt% Cr, a minimum of 0.15 wt% V , and thebalance being Fe. Spring wire is normally cold drawn (Section 11.4) to the desireddiameter; consequently, tensile strength will increase with the amount of drawing(i.e., with decreasing diameter). For this alloy it has been experimentally verifiedthat, for the diameter d in inches, the tensile strength is (22.20) TS 1psi2/H11005169,0001d2 /H110020.167taltm/H110050tm; te taltal/H11005te a1/H11002tm 0.67TSbtm/HS110050tm/HS110050tm/HS11005071062.25 /H110031082.25 /H11003108./H110054.5/H1100310822.6 One Commonly Employed Steel Alloy •155 0.67TS 45,000 psi Stress amplitude, S 103105107109 Cycles to failure, N (logarithmic scale)Figure 22.9 Shear stress amplitude versus logarithm of the numberof cycles to fatigue failurefor typical ferrous alloys.

The fatigue limit of this alloy may be increased to greater than 25,300 psi (175 MPa) by shot peening, a procedure described in Section 8.10.

Section 8.10. Shot peening involves the introduction of residual compressive surface stresses by plasticallydeforming outer surface regions; small and very hard particles are projected ontothe surface at high velocities. This is an automated procedure commonly usedto improve the fatigue resistance of valve springs; in fact, the spring shown inFigure 22.7 has been shot peened, which accounts for its rough surface texture. Shot peening has been observed to increase the fatigue limit of steel alloys inexcess of 50% and, in addition, to reduce significantly the degree of scatter offatigue data. This spring design, including shot peening, may be satisfactory; however, its ad- equacy should be verified by experimental testing.The testing procedure is relativelycomplicated and, consequently, will not be discussed in detail. In essence, it involvesperforming a relatively large number of fatigue tests (on the order of 1000) on thisshot-peened ASTM 232 steel, in shear, using a mean stress of 66,600 psi (460 MPa)and a stress amplitude of 25,600 psi (177 MPa), and for cycles. On the basis ofthe number of failures, an estimate of the survival probability can be made. For thesake of argument, let us assume that this probability turns out to be 0.99999; thismeans that one spring in 100,000 produced will fail. Suppose that you are employed by one of the large automobile companies that manufactures on the order of 1 million cars per year, and that the engine poweringeach automobile is a six-cylinder one. Since for each cylinder there are two valves,and thus two valve springs, a total of 12 million springs would be produced everyyear. For the above survival probability rate, the total number of spring failureswould be approximately 120, which also corresponds to 120 engine failures.

An in- vestigation was carried out to determine whether the axle failure caused the accidentor whether the failure occurred as a consequence of the accident. Figure 22.11 is a schematic diagram that shows the components of a rear axle as- sembly of the type used in this pickup truck. The fracture occurred adjacent to thebearing lock nut, as noted in this schematic. A photograph of one end of the failedaxle shaft is presented in Figure 22.12 a,and Figure 22.12 bis an enlarged view of the other fractured piece that includes the wheel mounting flange and the stub end of thefailed axle.

These results indicate that the mode of fracture within this outer periphery of the shaft was brittle. An SEM micrograph taken of the rough central region (Figure 22.15) revealed the presence of both brittle cleavage features and also dimples; thus, it is apparentthat the failure mode in this central interior region was mixed; that is, it was a com-bination of both brittle and ductile fracture. Metallographic examinations were also performed. A transverse cross section of the failed axle was polished, etched, and photographed using the optical micro-scope.

Hereit may be noted that the maximum hardness of approximately 56 HRC occurrednear the surface, and that hardness diminished with radial distance to a hardnessof about 20 HRC near the center. On the basis of the observed microstructures andthis hardness profile, it was assumed that the axle had been induction hardened. 6 At this point in the investigation it was not possible to ascertain irrefutably whether the axle fracture caused the accident or whether the accident caused thefracture. The high hardness and, in addition, the evidence of cleavage of the outersurface layer indicated that this region failed in a brittle manner as a result of beingoverloaded (i.e., as a result of the accident). On the other hand, the evidence of amixed ductile-brittle mode of fracture in the central region neither supported norrefuted either of the two possible failure scenarios.22.8 Testing Procedure and Results •161 Figure 22.16 Optical photomicrograph of the failed axle outer perimeter region,which is composed oftempered martensite.

Ferrite Pearlite 5Ferrite, pearlite, and bainite microconstituents are discussed in Sections 10.5 and 10.7. 6With induction hardening, the surface of a piece of medium-carbon steel is rapidly heated using an induction furnace. The piece is then quickly quenched so as to produce an outer surface layer of martensite (which is subsequently tempered), with a mixture offerrite and pearlite at interior regions.Figure 22.17 Optical photomicrograph of the failed axle central core region, which is composed of ferrite and pearlite (and possibly bainite).

By contrast, if failure was due to loads that were applied relatively slowly,as under normal driving conditions, the mode of failure would be more ductile. Inlight of this reasoning and, also, in order to glean further evidence as to cause offailure, it was decided to fabricate and test both impact and tensile specimens. Impact Tests For the impact tests, small [ mm (0.1 in.) wide] Charpy V-notch test specimens were prepared from both outer perimeter and interior areas. Since the hardenedouter region was very thin (6.4 mm thick), careful machining of these specimenswas required. Impact tests were conducted at room temperature, and it was notedthat the energy absorbed by the surface specimen was significantly lower than forthe core specimen [4 J (3 ft-lb f) versus 11 J (8 ft-lb f)]. Furthermore, the appearances of the fracture surfaces for the two specimens were dissimilar. Very little, if any, de-formation was observed for the outer perimeter specimen (Figure 22.19); conversely,the core specimen deformed significantly (Figure 22.20)./H110112.5162 •Chapter 22 / Materials Selection and Design Considerations Distance from outer surface (in. )Hardness (converted to Rockwell C) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8102030405060 Figure 22.18 Transverse hardness profile across the axle cross section.

Figure 22.21, a micrograph of the outer-periphery specimen that was impact tested, reveals the presence of cleavage features, which indicatesthat this was a brittle fracture. Furthermore, the morphology of this fracture sur-face is similar to that of the actual failed axle (Figure 22.14). For the impact specimen taken from the center-core region the fracture surface had a much different appearance; Figures 22.22 aand 22.22b show micrographs for this specimen, which were taken at relatively low and high magnifications, respec-tively. These micrographs reveal the details of this surface to be composed of in-terspersed cleavage features and shallow dimples, being similar to the failed axle,as shown in Figure 22.15. Thus, the fracture of this specimen was of the mixed-modetype, having both ductile and brittle components.22.8 Testing Procedure and Results •163 Figure 22.20 Fracture surface of the Charpy impact specimen that was taken from the central core region.

brittle fracture. Thus,although this center-core material exhibited mixed-mode fracture under impactloading conditions, when the load was applied at a relatively slow rate (as with thetensile test), failure was highly ductile in nature. 22.9 DISCUSSION In light of the previous discussion it was supposed that the truck rollover wasresponsible for the axle failure. Reasons for this supposition are as follows: 1.The outer perimeter region of the failed axle shaft failed in a brittle manner, as did also the specimen taken from this region that was impact tested. Thisconclusion was based on the fact that both fracture surfaces were very flat,and that SEM micrographs revealed the presence of cleavage facets. 2.The fracture behavior of the central core region was strain-rate sensitive, and indicated that axle failure was due to a single high strain-rate incident. Frac-ture surface features for both the failed axle and impact-tested (i.e., high-strain-rate-tested) specimens taken from this core region were similar: SEMmicrographs revealed the presence of features (cleavage features and dim-ples) that are characteristic of mixed mode (brittle and ductile) fracture. In spite of evidence supporting the validity of the accident-caused-axle-failure scenario, the plausibility of the other (axle-failure-caused-the-accident) scenario was also explored. This latter scenario necessarily assumes that a fatigue crack or someother slow-crack propagation mechanism initiated the sequence of events thatcaused the accident. In this case it is important to consider the mechanical charac-teristics of that portion of the specimen that was last to fail—in this instance, thecore region. If failure was due to fatigue, then any increase in loading level of thiscore region would have occurred relatively slowly, not rapidly as with impact load-ing conditions. During this gradually increasing load level, fatigue crack propagationwould have continued until a critical length was achieved (i.e., until the remainingintact axle cross section was no longer capable of sustaining the applied load); atthis time, final failure would have occurred.

have occurred. On the basis of the tensile tests (i.e., slow strain-rate tests) performed on this core region, the appearance of the axle fracture surface would be entirely ductile(i.e., dimpled, as per the SEM micrograph of Figure 22.23). Inasmuch as this coreregion of the failed shaft exhibited mixed (ductile and brittle) mode fracture features(both cleavage features and dimples, Figure 22.15), and not exclusively dimples, theaxle-failure-caused-the-accident scenario was rejected. Artificial Total Hip Replacement 22.10 ANATOMY OF THE HIP JOINT As a prelude to discussing the artificial hip, let us first briefly address some of theanatomical features of joints in general and the hip joint in particular. The joint isan important component of the skeletal system. It is located at bone junctions, whereloads may be transmitted from bone to bone by muscular action; this is normallyaccompanied by some relative motion of the component bones. Bone tissue is acomplex natural composite consisting of soft and strong protein collagen and brittlehydroxyapatite, which has a density between 1.6 and 1.7 Bone is an anisotropic g/cm 3.22.10 Anatomy of the Hip Joint •1651496T_c22_143-191 11/3/05 20:07 Page 165FIRST PAGESmaterial with mechanical properties that differ in the longitudinal (axial) and trans- verse (radial) directions (Table 22.3). The articulating (or connecting) surface ofeach joint is coated with cartilage, which consists of body fluids that lubricate andprovide an interface with a very low coefficient of friction that facilitates the bone-sliding movement. The human hip joint (Figure 22.24) occurs at the junction between the pelvis and the upper leg (thigh) bone, or femur. A relatively large range of rotary motionis permitted at the hip by a ball-and-socket type of joint; the top of the femur ter-minates in a ball-shaped head that fits into a cup-like cavity (the acetabulum) withinthe pelvis.

withinthe pelvis. An X-ray of a normal hip joint is shown in Figure 22.25 a. This joint is susceptible to fracture, which normally occurs at the narrow region just below the head. An x-ray of a fractured hip is shown in Figure 22.25 b;the ar- rows show the two ends of the fracture line through the femoral neck. Furthermore,the hip may become diseased (osteoarthritis); in such a case small lumps of boneform on the rubbing surfaces of the joint, which causes pain as the head rotates inthe acetabulum. Damaged and diseased hip joints have been replaced with artifi-cial or prosthetic ones, with moderate success, beginning in the late 1950s.

The property constraints on the materials to be used for these ele-ments are very stringent because of the chemical and mechanical complexity of thehip joint. Some of the requisite material characteristics will now be discussed. Whenever any foreign material is introduced into the body environment, re- jection reactions occur. The magnitude of rejection may range from mild irritationor inflammation to death. Any implant material must be biocompatible, that is, it must produce a minimum degree of rejection.

of rejection. Products resulting from reactionswith body fluids must be tolerated by the surrounding body tissues such that nor-mal tissue function is unimpaired. Biocompatibility is a function of the location ofthe implant, as well as its chemistry and shape. Body fluids consist of an aerated and warm solution containing approximately 1 wt% NaCl in addition to other salts and organic compounds in relatively minorconcentrations. Thus, body fluids are very corrosive, which for metal alloys can leadnot only to uniform corrosion but also to crevice attack and pitting and, whenstresses are present, to fretting, 7stress corrosion cracking, and corrosion fatigue. It has been estimated that the maximum tolerable corrosion rate for implant metalalloys is about 0.01 mil per year ( mm per year). Another adverse consequence of corrosion is the generation of corrosion prod- ucts that are either toxic or interfere with normal body functions. These substancesare rapidly transported throughout the body; some may segregate in specific organs.Even though others may be excreted from the body, they may nevertheless still per-sist in relatively high concentrations because of the ongoing corrosion process. The bones and replacement components within the hip joint must support forces that originate from outside the body, such as those due to gravity; in addition, theymust transmit forces that result from muscular action such as walking. These forcesare complex in nature and fluctuate with time in magnitude, in direction, and inrate of application. Thus, mechanical characteristics such as modulus of elasticity,yield strength, tensile strength, fatigue strength, fracture toughness, and ductility areall important considerations relative to the materials of choice for the prosthetichip. For example, the material used for the femoral stem should have minimumyield and tensile strengths of approximately 500 MPa (72,500 psi) and 650 MPa(95,000 psi), respectively, and a minimum ductility of about 8%EL.

about 8%EL. In addition, thefatigue strength (for bending stresses that are fully reversed [Figure 8.17 a]) should be at least 400 MPa (60,000 psi) at 10 7cycles. For the average person, the load on the hip joint fluctuates on the order of 106times per year. Ideally the modulus of elasticity of the prosthetic material should match that of bone. A significant differ-ence can lead to deterioration of the surrounding bone tissue and implant failure,which requires a second surgery and another prosthetic implant. Furthermore, since the ball-and-cup articulating surfaces rub against one an- other, wear of these surfaces is minimized by using very hard materials. Excessiveand uneven wear can lead to a change in shape of the articulating surfaces andcause the prosthesis to malfunction. In addition, particulate debris will be generatedas the articulating surfaces wear against one another; accumulation of this debrisin the surrounding tissues can also lead to inflammation.2.5/H1100310 /H110024168 •Chapter 22 / Materials Selection and Design Considerations 7Fretting is a combination of corrosion and wear in which corrosion produces small debris (generally oxide particles) that increases the friction and induces greater abrasion.1496T_c22_143-191 11/3/05 20:07 Page 168FIRST PAGESFrictional forces at these rubbing counterfaces should also be minimized to prevent loosening of the femoral stem and acetabular cup assembly from their positions secured by the fixation agent. If these components do become loose overtime, the hip joint will experience premature degradation that may require it tobe replaced. Three final important material factors are density, property reproducibility, and cost. It is highly desirable that lightweight components be used, that material prop-erties from prosthesis to prosthesis remain consistent over time, and, of course, thatthe cost of the prosthesis components be reasonable. Ideally, an artificial hip that has been surgically implanted should function satis- factorily for the life of the recipient and not require replacement.

require replacement. For current designs,lifetimes range between 15 and 25 years.While this is a substantial improvement fromthe previous five to ten year figures, longer lifetimes are still desirable. Several final comments are in order relative to biocompatibility assessment. Biocompatibility of materials is usually determined empirically; that is, tests areconducted wherein materials are implanted in laboratory animals and the biocom-patibility of each material is judged on the basis of rejection reactions, level ofcorrosion, generation of toxic substances, etc. This procedure is then repeated onhumans for those materials that were found to be relatively biocompatible in ani-mals. It is difficult to a priori predict the biocompatibility of a material. For example, mercury, when ingested into the body, is poisonous; however, dental amalgams,which have high mercury contents, have generally been found to be very biocom-patible. Because of this biocompatibility assessment issue, most manufacturers selectonly materials that have been approved for biomedical use. One final requirement for implant materials is that they be nonmagnetic [i.e., not exhibit ferromagnetic or ferromagnetic behavior (Chapter 20)]. A frequentlyused medical diagnostic tool is MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) spectroscopy,a medical test in which the patient is subjected to a very strong magnetic field.The presence of any ferromagnetic/ferromagnetic materials implanted in the pa- tient will disrupt the applied magnetic field, and render MRI spectroscopy unus-able. In addition, the magnitudes of these magnetic fields are such that significantforces may be brought to bear on any magnetic implant materials, which forcesmay loosen the implant and/or harm the patient. Ferromagnetic materials thatshould be avoided for implant applications include some ferrous alloys (i.e., fer-ritic and martensitic stainless steels), and alloys having high contents of nickeland/or cobalt.

nickeland/or cobalt. 22.12 MATERIALS EMPLOYED Femoral Stem and Ball Early prosthetic hip designs called for both the femoral stem and ball to be of thesame material—a stainless steel. Subsequent improvements have been introduced,including the utilization of materials other than stainless steel and, in addition, con-structing the stem and ball from different materials. Indeed, stainless steel is rarelyused in current implant designs. The chapter-opening photograph for this chaptershows one hip replacement design. Currently, the femoral stem is constructed from a metal alloy of which there are two primary types: cobalt–chromium–molybdenum and titanium. Some modelsstill use 316L stainless steel, which has a very low sulfur content its composition is given in Table 11.4. The principal disadvantages of this alloy are itssusceptibility to crevice corrosion and pitting and its relatively low fatigue strength.As a result its use has decreased.

One that has been found to be especially suitable, designated F75, is a cast alloy that has a com- position of 66 wt% Co, 28 wt% Cr, and 6 wt% Mo. Its mechanical properties andcorrosion rate range are listed in Table 22.4. The corrosion and fatigue characteris-tics of this alloy are excellent. Of those metal alloys that are implanted for prosthetic hip joints, probably the most biocompatible is the titanium alloy Ti–6Al–4V; its composition is 90 wt% Ti,6 wt% Al, and 4 wt% V . The optimal properties for this material are produced byhot forging; any subsequent deformation and/or heat treatment should be avoidedto prevent the formation of microstructures that are deleterious to its bioperfor-mance. The properties of this alloy are also listed in Table 22.4. Recent improvements for this prosthetic device include using a ceramic mate- rial for the ball component rather than any of the aforementioned metal alloys. Theceramics of choice are a high-purity and polycrystalline aluminum oxide or zirco-nium oxide, which are harder and more wear resistant than metals, and generatelower frictional stresses at the joint. However, the elastic moduli of these ceramicsare large and the fracture toughness of alumina is relatively low.

relatively low. Hence, the femoralstem, is still fabricated from one of the above alloys, and is then attached to theceramic ball; this femoral stem–ball component thus becomes a two-piece unit. The materials selected for use in an orthopedic implant come after years of re- search into the chemical and physical properties of a host of different candidate ma-terials. Ideally, the material(s) of choice will not only be biocompatible but will alsohave mechanical properties that match the biomaterial being replaced—bone. How-ever, no man-made material is both biocompatible and possesses the property com-bination of bone and the natural hip joint—low modulus of elasticity, relatively highstrength and fracture toughness, low coefficient of friction, and excellent wear resist-ance. Consequently, material property compromises and trade-offs must be made. Forexample, recall that the modulus of elasticity of bone and femoral stem materials shouldbe closely matched such that accelerated deterioration of the bone tissue adjacent tothe implant is avoided. Unfortunately, man-made materials that are both biocompat-ible and relatively strong also have high moduli of elasticity. Thus, for this application,it was decided to trade off a low modulus for biocompatibility and strength. Acetabular Cup Some acetabular cups are made from one of the biocompatible alloys or aluminumoxide. More commonly, however, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (Section15.19) is used. This material is virtually inert in the body environment and has excel-lent wear-resistance characteristics; furthermore, it has a very low coefficient of frictionwhen in contact with the materials used for the ball component of the socket. A two-component cup assembly is shown for the total hip implant in the chapter-openingphotograph for this chapter. It consists of an ultrahigh molecular weight polyethyleneinsert that fits within the cup; this cup is fabricated from one of the metal alloys listedin Table 22.4, which, after implantation, becomes bonded to the pelvis.

the pelvis. Fixation Successful performance of the artificial hip joint calls for the secure attachment of boththe femoral stem to the femur and the acetabular cup to the pelvis. Insecure attach-ment of either component ultimately leads to a loosening of that component and theaccelerated degradation of the joint. A fixation agent is sometimes used to bond thesetwo prosthetic components to their surrounding bone structures. The most com-monly used fixation agent is a poly(methyl methacrylate) (acrylic) bone cement that22.12 Materials Employed •1711496T_c22_143-191 11/3/05 20:07 Page 171FIRST PAGESis polymerized in situ during surgery. This reaction must be carefully controlled be- cause the heat released during polymerization can lead to damage to the bone tissue. This acrylic bond cement has, in some cases, contributed to femoral stem loos- ening because it is brittle and does not bond well with the metallic implant and bone tissue. It has been found that a more secure implant–bone bond is formed when thestem and cup are coated with a porous surface layer consisting of a sintered metalpowder. After implantation, bone tissue grows into the three-dimensional pore net-work and thereby fixates the implant to the bone. Such a coating has been appliedto the upper stem and outer acetabular cup regions of the hip replacement shownin the chapter-opening photograph for this chapter. Chemical Protective Clothing 22.13 INTRODUCTION There are a number of commercially important chemicals that, when exposed to the human body, can produce undesirable reactions; these reactions may range frommild skin irritation, to organ damage, or, in the extreme case, death. Anyone whorisks exposure to these chemicals should wear chemical protective clothing (CPC)to prevent direct skin contact and contamination. Protective clothing includes atleast gloves, but in some instances boots, suits, and/or respirators may be required.This case study involves the assessment of chemical protective glove materials for exposure to methylene chloride.

methylene chloride. The choice of a suitable glove material should include consideration of several important factors. The first of these is breakthrough time—i.e., the length of time(in minutes) until first detection of the toxic chemical species inside the glove. An-other key factor is the exposure rate—that is, how much of the toxic chemical passes through the glove per unit time. Consideration of both breakthrough time and ex-posure rate is important. Other relevant material factors include material degrad-ability, flexibility, and puncture resistance. Trade-offs of these several characteristicsmay be necessary. For example, a thick glove may have a longer breakthrough timeand lower exposure rate, but be less flexible than a thin glove. Common commercially available glove materials include natural rubber, nitrile rubber, poly(vinyl chloride), neoprene rubber, and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). Somegloves are multilayered, that is, composed of layers of two different materials that take advantage of the desirable features of each. For example, PVA is highly im-permeable to many organic solvents, but is soluble in water; any exposure to watercan soften (and ultimately dissolve) the glove. To counteract this liability, CPC ma-terials that consist of a thin layer of PVA sandwiched between two layers of a non-polar polymer such as polyethylene have been developed. The PVA layer impedesthe diffusion of nonpolar materials (i.e., many of the organic solvents), whereas thepolyethylene layers shield the PVA from water and inhibit the permeation of polarsolvents (i.e., water and alcohols). 22.14 ASSESSMENT OF CPC GLOVES MATERIALS TO PROTECT AGAINST EXPOSURE TO METHYLENE CHLORIDE Let us consider the selection of a glove material for use with methylene chloride (CH 2Cl2), a common ingredient in paint removers.

paint removers. Methylene chloride is a skin ir- ritant, and, furthermore, may also be absorbed into the body through skin; studies172 •Chapter 22 / Materials Selection and Design Considerations1496T_c22_143-191 11/3/05 20:07 Page 172FIRST PAGESsuggest that its presence in the body may cause cancer as well as birth defects. Computations of breakthrough time and exposure rate for methylene chloride thatis in contact with potential glove materials are possible. In light of the hazardousnature of CH 2Cl2,for these calculations any assumptions we make are conserva- tive, and overestimate the inherent dangers. The breakthrough time is related to the diffusion coefficient of methylene chloride in the glove material ( D) and the glove thickness ( ) according to the fol- lowing equation: (22.24) Values of D,, and (computed using the above expression) for several commer- cially available CPC glove materials are provided in Table 22.5. Breakthrough timescan also be measured directly using appropriate equipment; these measured valuesare in good agreement with the calculated ones presented in the table. For exposure rate computations, we assume that a condition of steady-state dif- fusion has been achieved, and also that concentration profile is linear [Figure 5.4( b)]. In actual fact, at the outset of exposure to methylene chloride, its diffusion throughthe glove is nonsteady-state, and the accompanying diffusion rates are lower thanthose calculated for conditions of steady state. For steady-state diffusion, the diffu-sion flux J is according to Equation 5.3 as (22.25) And for a linear concentration profile, this equation takes the form (22.26) We arbitrarily take the A and B subscripts to denote glove surfaces in contact with the methylene chloride and with the hand, respectively. In addition, the glove thick-ness such that the above equation now takes the form (22.27) Now, the exposure rate is equal to the product of the diffusion flux and total glovesurface are ( A)—that is (22.28) An average size pair of gloves has an inside surface area of about 800 cm 2.Fur- thermore, the surface concentration of methylene chloride (i.e., ) is equal to itssolubility in that polymer (which we denote as ); solubility values for the severalglove materials are also included in Table 22.5.

Now, if we assume that all methyl-ene chloride, upon contact, is immediately absorbed by the skin and swept away bythe blood stream, then takes on a value of 0 g/cm 3.8Thus, upon making the above CBSACAre/H11005JA/H11005DA / 1CA/H11002CB2reJ/H11005D CA/H11002CB ///H11005xB/H11002xA,J/H11005/H11002 D CA/H11002CB xA/H11002xBJ/H11005/H11002 D dC dxtb /tb/H11005/2 6D/tb22.14 Assessment of CPC Gloves Materials to Protect Against Exposure to Methylene Chloride •173 Computation of breakthrough timefor passage of ahazardous chemicalthrough a chemicalprotective glovematerial 8In most practical situations, since not all of the methylene chloride that passes through the glove will immediately be absorbed into the skin and removed from the hand by the blood stream.

Equation 22.29. At this point, a key question is: What is an acceptable and safe exposure rate? Based on airborne exposure limits set by the Occupational Safety and Health Ad-ministration (OSHA) of the US, the maximum allowable to methylene chlorideis approximately 1 g/h. Now let us examine and compare computed breakthrough times and exposure rates for the several glove materials, as listed in Table 22.5. First of all, with regardto exposure rate, two of the seven materials meet or exceed the standard set byOSHA (viz., 1 g/h)—viz. multilayer (Silver Shield TM) and VitonTMrubber (with values of 0.43 and 0.35 g/h, respectively). Relative to breakthrough time, the mul-tilayer material has the longer (24 hr versus about 6h for the Viton rubber). Fur-thermore, the multilayer gloves are considerably less inexpensive (at $US4.19 perpair compared to $US72.00 for Viton rubber, Table 22.5). Therefore, of these two glove materials, other relevant characteristics/proper- ties being equal, the one of choice for this application is multilayer Silver Shield. Ithas a significantly longer breakthrough time and is much less costly than the Vitonrubber material, whereas there is very little difference between their exposure rates.The photograph of Figure 22.27 shows a pair if Silver Shield gloves. It should be noted that calculated breakthrough time values presented in Table 22.5 assumed the glove material had no previous exposure to methylene chloride.For a second application, some of the methylene chloride that dissolved in the glove during the first exposure probably remains; thus, the breakthrough time will be muchshorter than predicted for an unused glove. For this reason, CPC gloves are oftendiscarded after one usage. One final comment is in order: one should always consult an industrial hygiene specialist when selecting chemical protection clothing.

The heart of the integrated circuit (abbreviated IC) is the c hip, a small rectangular substrate of high-purity and single-crystal silicon (or more recentlygallium arsenide) onto which literally thousands of circuit elements are imprinted.Circuit elements (i.e., transistors, resistors, diodes, etc.) are created by selectivelyadding controlled concentrations of specific impurities to extremely minute andlocalized regions near the surface of the semiconducting material using involvedphotolithographic techniques. The chips are small in size, with the largest on theorder of 6 mm ( in.) on each side and approximately 0.4 mm (0.015 in.) thick.Photographs of a typical chip are shown in Figure 18.27. Furthermore, chips are very fragile inasmuch as silicon is a relatively brittle ma- terial and gallium arsenide is even more brittle. It is also necessary to fabricate con-ducting circuit paths over the surface of the chip to facilitate the passage of currentfrom device to device; on silicon ICs the metal conductor used is aluminum or an alu-minum–silicon alloy (99 wt% Al, 1 wt% Si) that is metallized onto the chip surface toform a very thin film.

thin film. The chip design also calls for these circuit paths to terminate atcontact pads on the chip periphery, at which points electrical connections may be madewith the macroscopic world. It should be obvious that a functioning microelectronicchip is a very sophisticated electronic entity, that materials requirements are very strin-gent, and that elegant processing techniques are involved in its fabrication. A large number of IC chips are fabricated onto a circular thin wafer of single- crystal Si, as shown in the photograph in Figure 22.28. Single crystals of Si having 1 4176 •Chapter 22 / Materials Selection and Design Considerations Figure 22.28 Photograph of a 100-mm-diameter (4-in.-diameter) siliconwafer.

Tanner. 1496T_c22_143-191 11/3/05 20:07 Page 176FIRST PAGESdiameters as large as 200 mm (8 in.) are routinely grown.The small rectangular ICs arrayed in the manner shown in the photograph are collectively referred to as dice. Each IC or die(singular of dice) is first tested for functionality, after which it is re- moved from the wafer in a meticulous sawing or “scribe and break” operation. Next,the die is mounted in some type of package.T he packaged IC may then be bonded to a printed circuit board. The purpose of this section is to discuss the materialrequirements and some of the materials that are used for the various IC packagecomponents. Some of the functions that an integrated circuit package must perform include the following: 1.To permit electrical contact between the devices on the chip and the macroscopic world. The contact pads on the surface of the IC are so minuscule and numerous that accommodation of macroscopic wiringis simply not possible. 2.To dissipate excess heat.

excess heat. While in operation, the many electronic devices generate significant quantities of heat, which must be dissipated away fromthe chip. 3.To protect delicate electrical connections on the chip from chemical degrada- tion and contamination. 4.To provide mechanical support so that the small and fragile chip may be handled. 5.To provide an adequate electrical interface such that the performance of the IC itself is not significantly degraded by the package design. Thus, IC packaging also poses a host of material demands that are very chal- lenging. In fact, it has been noted that the performance of some ICs is limited, not by the characteristics of the semiconducting materials or by the metallizationprocess, but rather by the quality of the package. There are a number of differentpackage designs used by the various IC manufacturers. For one of the common de-signs, the leadframe, we have elected to discuss the various components and, for each component, the materials that are employed along with their property limita-tions.This package design is popular with digital IC manufacturers primarily becauseits production can be highly automated. 22.16 LEADFRAME DESIGN AND MATERIALS The leadframe, as the name suggests, is a frame to which electrical leads may be made from the IC chip. A photograph of a leadframe-type package is shown inFigure 22.29. In essence, the leadframe consists of a central plate onto which the die is mounted, and an array of contact leads to which wire connections may bemade from the contact pads on the chip. Some leadframe designs also call for asubstrate onto which the die is mounted; this substrate is, in turn, bonded to thecentral plate. During the packaging process, and after the chip has been attachedto the central plate (a procedure termed die bonding), the contact pads on the IC chip are cleaned, wires are attached to both the contact pads and the leadframeleads (called wire bonding), and, finally, this package is encapsulated in a protec- tive enclosure to seal out moisture, dust, and other contaminants.

other contaminants. This procedureis called hermetic sealing. There are some rather stringent requirements on the properties of the mate- rial to be used for the leadframe; these are as follows: (1) The leadframe materialmust have a high electrical conductivity because there will be current passagethrough its leads. (2) The leadframe, the die attach central plate, substrate (if pres ent),22.16 Leadframe Design and Materials •177 1496T_c22_143-191 11/3/05 20:07 Page 177FIRST PAGESand die-bonding adhesive must also be thermally conductive to facilitate the dissi- pation of heat generated by the IC. (3) A coefficient of thermal expansion compa-rable to that of Si is highly desirable; a thermal expansion mismatch could destroythe integrity of the bond between the IC and the central plate as a result of ther-mal cycling during normal operation. (4) The leadframe material and substrate mustalso adhere to the die-bonding adhesive, and the adhesive and substrate must alsobe electrically conductive. (5) A secure and electrically conductive joint betweenthe leadframe and the connecting wires must be possible. (6) The leadframe mustbe resistant to oxidation and retain its mechanical strength during any thermal cy-cling that may accompany the die-bonding and encapsulation procedures. (7) Theleadframe must also withstand corrosive environments at high temperatures andhigh humidities. (8) It must be possible to mass produce the leadframes economi-cally. Normally, they are stamped from thin metal sheets. Several alloys have been used for the leadframe with varying degrees of suc- cess. The most commonly used materials are copper-based alloys; the compositions,electrical and thermal conductivities, and coefficients of thermal expansion for twoof the most popular ones (C19400 and C19500) are listed in Table 22.6.

Table 22.6. For the mostpart, they satisfy the criteria listed in the preceding paragraph. Also listed in thetable are the compositions of two other alloys (Kovar and Alloy 42) that have beenused extensively in leadframes.The desirability of these latter two alloys lies in theirrelatively low coefficients of thermal expansion, which are closely matched to thatof Si [i.e., ]. However, from Table 22.6 it may also be noted that both electrical and thermal conductivities for Kovar and Alloy 42 are inferior tothe conductivity values for the C19400 and C19500 alloys. 22.17 DIE BONDING The die-bonding operation consists of attaching the IC chip to the central supporting leadframe plate. For the copper alloys noted in Table 22.6, attachment may be madeusing a gold–silicon eutectic solder; however, melting of the solder requires heatingthe assembly to Another adhesive possibility is an epoxy bonding agent, which is normally filled with metal particles (frequently Ag) so as to provide both a thermally and500/H11034C (900/H11034F).2.5/H1100310 /H110026 (/H11034C)/H110021178 •Chapter 22 / Materials Selection and Design Considerations Figure 22.29 Photograph of a leadframe on which the central plate and contact leads are labeled.

Curing of the epoxy is carried out at temperatures between and de- pending on the application. Since the amounts of thermal expansion are differentfor the Cu alloy leadframe plate and Si chip, the epoxy adhesive must be capableof absorbing any thermal strains produced during temperature changes such thatthe mechanical integrity of the junction is maintained.

22.29b ). A wire-bonding procedure is nor- mally carried out using a microjoining operation, since very fine wires are usedto make the connections. Wire bonding is the slow step in the packaging processbecause several hundred wires may need to be installed; this procedure is usu-ally automated. Several important considerations must be taken into account relative to the choice of wire alloy. Of course, a high electrical conductivity is the prime prerequi-site. In addition, consideration must be given to the ability of the alloy to bond, bywelding or brazing, with both the Al alloy at the chip pad and the Cu alloy on theleadframe; the formation of a microjoint that is both mechanically and electricallystable is an absolute necessity. The most commonly used wire material is gold—actually a gold alloy contain- ing a small amount of beryllium–copper that is added to inhibit grain growth. Goldwires are round and have diameters that are typically (0.0007 in. ),(0.001 in. ), or (0.002 in.). Less costly Cu and Al have also been employedfor contact wires. Prior to making the microjoint, regions of the chip pad and lead-frame surfaces at which the junctions are to be made may be coated with Au to im-prove bondability. During the actual microjoining process, one wire end is broughtinto the vicinity of one of the joint regions using a special tool. This wire end is thenmelted with a spark or flame heat source. Two different types of microjoints are possible: ball and wedge. Figure 22.31 is a schematic diagram showing a connecting wire having a ball microjoint at itscontact pad end and a wedge microjoint at the leadframe connection. Ball jointsare possible for gold wires since the melted wire end forms into a small ball be-cause of the high surface tension of gold. Bonding of this molten ball with thecontact pad or leadframe is accomplished by making mechanical contact with thebonding surface while both wire and surface are subjected to ultrasonic vibra-tions.

ultrasonic vibra-tions. A scanning electron micrograph of a ball microjoint is shown in Figure22.32a .This type of microjoint is especially desirable since, after the first of the two microjoints for each wire has been made (usually on the IC contact pad), thewire may then be bent in any direction in preparation for the microjoining of itsother extremity. The ends of copper and aluminum wires do not form balls upon melting. They are wedge microjoined by positioning the wire between a vibrating probe and the contact pad or leadframe surface; the vibrations loosen and remove sur-face contaminants, which results in intimate contact of the two surfaces. An electriccurrent is then applied through the probe, which welds the wire to the surface.50 mm25 mm 18 mm22.18 Wire Bonding •181 Connecting wire Contact padWedge bond (second bond) Ball bond (first bond)LeadframeFigure 22.31 Schematic diagram showing a connecting wire that is ball bonded to the IC contact pad and wedge bonded tothe leadframe.

Gold wires may also be bonded using wedge microjoints. Figure 22.32 b is a scanning electron micrograph of a wedge microjoint. There are other considerations relative to wire bonding that deserve mention- ing. Microjunction alloy combinations that form intermetallic phases should beavoided because these phases are normally brittle and yield microjoints lackinglong-term mechanical stability.

Furthermore, me-chanical integrity at each microjoint is important to (1) withstand vibrations thatthe package may experience, and (2) survive thermal stresses that are generated asthe packaging materials change temperature. 22.19 PACKAGE ENCAPSULATION The microelectronic package, as now constituted, must be provided some type of protection from corrosion, contamination, and damage during handling and whilein service. The wire interconnection microjunctions are extremely fragile and maybe easily damaged. Especially vulnerable to corrosion are the narrow Al circuitpaths that have been metallized onto the surface of the IC chip; even the slightestcorrosion of these elements will impair the operation of the chip. These Al-metallized layers experience corrosion when atmospheric moisture in which evenminute concentrations of ionic contaminants are dissolved (especially chlorine andphosphorus) condenses on the chip surface. Furthermore, the corrosive reactionsare accelerated as a consequence of electric currents that pass through these circuitpaths. In addition, any sodium (as Na /H11001) that gets on the chip surface will eventually diffuse into the chip and destroy its operation.182 •Chapter 22 / Materials Selection and Design Considerations Figure 22.32 Scanning electron micrographs of ( a) a ball bond ( ), and ( b) a wedge bond ( ).

IC package. Both ceramic and polymeric materials are used to encapsulate IC packages; of course each of these material types has its own set of assets and liabilities. Ceram-ics are extremely resistant to moisture penetration and are chemically stable andchemically inert. Glasses are the most commonly utilized ceramic materials. Theprincipal disadvantage of glass is the requirement that it be heated to moderatelyhigh temperatures to lower its viscosity to the point where it will flow around andmake intimate contact with all of the wires that are microjoined to the chip surface.Some common glass constituents should be avoided (notably Na 2O and K 2O) since volatile cation species (Na/H11001and K/H11001) may be emitted from the molten glass. These species are notorious in accelerating corrosion reactions, and the ions will degradethe chip performance. Polymeric materials are used in the largest volume for packaging encapsulation because they are not as costly as the ceramics, and they may be produced in a low-viscosity state at lower temperatures. Epoxies and polyurethanes are commonlyused, with the former being the most common. However, these materials have atendency to absorb water and do not form moisture-tight bonds with the lead wires.Some of these polymers require curing at a temperature on the order of andduring cooling to room temperature will shrink more than other package compo-nents to which they are attached. This difference in amounts of contraction can giverise to mechanical strains of sufficient magnitude to damage the connecting wiresas well as other electronic components. The addition of appropriate fillers (such asfine silica or alumina particles) to the polymer can alleviate this problem but often150/H11034C,22.19 Package Encapsulation •183 IC chip Encapsulation Connecting wire Encapsulation LeadframeFigure 22.33 Schematic diagram showing an encapsulated IC leadframe package.

A comparison of the important encapsu- lation characteristics of four different polymer types is given in Table 22.7. 22.20 TAPE AUTOMATED BONDING Another packaging design, tape automated bonding (or TAB ), a variation of the leadframe discussed above, has found widespread use by virtue of its low cost. Thetape-bonded package consists of a thin and flexible polyimide polymer backing filmsubstrate; onto this substrate surface is patterend an array of copper “finger” high-conductivity conduction paths similar in configuration to the contact leads for theconventional leadframe. A schematic diagram of a tape-bonded film leadframe isshown in Figure 22.34. Mechanical support for the assembly is provided by the polyimide film, onto which the die is bonded using an adhesive. Polyimide strip widths are typically 35 mm (1.38 in. ),and sprocket holes are incorporated along opposing edges to facilitate movement andpositioning of the TAB leadframes. Literally thousands of these individual units, at-tached end to end, are spooled onto reels in preparation for automated processing.184 •Chapter 22 / Materials Selection and Design Considerations Table 22.7 Property Comparisons of Four Classes of Polymers Used for IC Package Encapsulation Epoxy Resins Silicones Polyurethanes Polysulphides Dielectric strength Good Good Good Good Elastic modulus High Low Wide range Low Tensile strength High Low Wide range — Precursor viscosity Low Low Low High Adhesion to package Excellent Poor Good Good (to ceramics) Moisture diffusion rate High High Low Very low Source: From C.

Separa- tion distances of the inner contact leads are on the order of 50 m, which is much smaller than is possible for the stamped leadframe. Furthermore, each die chip con-tact pad is microjoined directly to one these copper fingers, which eliminates the needfor any connecting wires.The copper fingers are very thin, so that, for this direct bond-ing to be achieved, the chip pad bonding sites must be raised above the metallizedcoating. This is accomplished using “solder bumps,” which are normally layers of gold(or gold-plated copper) approximately 25 m thick. Schematic representations illus-trating this attachment design are presented in Figure 22.35. The finger contacts arebonded to these raised bumps by soldering using a thermal-compression bonding tool.This tape-bonding design is fully automated in that all of the hundred or so microjoints can be made in a single step, a feature not possible with leadframes that requiremultiple wire-bonding operations. The packaging operation for the TAB leadframe is completed, as with the stamped leadframe, by encapsulation of the assembly (i.e., tape leadframe and itsattached chip) within a fluid polymeric material that subsequently cures to form aprotective shield.

aprotective shield. Protruding from this package are the copper finger conductingpaths to which external electrical connections are made. Furthermore, excess heatgenerated by the chip must be dissipated along these copper fingers since the poly-mer tape backing does not provide an effective thermal conduction path becauseof its low thermal conductivity. The ultimate design goal of the IC package is to allow for the proper electri- cal operation of the packaged device. As frequencies and computing speeds creepever higher, the mechanical and electrical design considerations of the package de-sign must become more and more integrated. The overall electrical performance ofthe package is as important to the end user as the overall reliability.mm22.20 Tape Automated Bonding •185 Figure 22.35 Schematic diagrams showing (a) the cross section of an encapsulated TAB leadframe package, and (b) how bonding between the IC chip and a copper finger is achieved with a solder bump.

For the first case, a torsionally stressed cylindrical shaft, an ex-pression for strength performance index was derived; then, using the appropriatematerials selection chart, a preliminary candidate search was conducted. From theresults of this search, several candidate engineering materials were ranked on bothstrength-per-unit mass and cost bases.

cost bases. Other factors that are relevant to the decision-making process were also discussed. Automobile Valve Spring A stress analysis was next performed on a helical spring, which was then extended to an automobile valve spring. It was noted that the possibility of fatigue failurewas crucial to the performance of this spring application. The shear stress ampli-tude was computed, the magnitude of which was almost identical to the calcu-lated fatigue limit for a chrome–vanadium steel that is commonly used for valvesprings. It was noted that the fatigue limit of valve springs is often enhancedby shot peening. Finally, a procedure was suggested for assessing the economicfeasibility of this spring design incorporating the shot-peened chrome–vanadiumsteel. Failure of an Automobile Rear Axle The next case study was devoted to a failure analysis, which detailed an investiga- tion conducted on a failed rear axle of a light pickup truck that had overturned; the problem was to determine whether the accident resulted from this failure, or viceversa. Impact and tensile specimens were fabricated from outer perimeter and in-terior regions of the axle, which were subsequently tested. On the basis of scanningelectron and metallographic examinations of the actual failed axle surface, as wellas the surfaces of these test specimens, it was concluded that the accident causedthe axle failure. Artificial Total Hip Replacement For the fourth case study, the artificial total hip replacement was explored. The hip anatomy was first presented, which was followed by a discussion of the components and material requirements for the artificial replacement. Implant materials must bebiocompatible with body tissues and fluids, must be corrosion resistant, and mustalso be mechanically compatible with interfacing replacement/body components.The femoral stem and ball are normally made of a cold-worked stainless steel, a cast Co–Cr–Mo alloy, or a hot-forged titanium alloy. Some recent designs call for apolycrystalline aluminum oxide or zirconium oxide ball.

oxide ball. Ultrahigh molecular weightpolyethylene is commonly used for the acetabular cup, whereas acrylic bone cementis normally the fixation agent for attachment of the femoral stem (to the femur)and acetabular cup (to the pelvis). Chemical Protective Clothing The fifth materials case study was concerned with materials to be used for chemical protective clothing—specifically, glove materials to protect against exposure to186 •Chapter 22 / Materials Selection and Design Considerations 1496T_c22_143-191 11/3/05 20:07 Page 186FIRST PAGESmethylene chloride, a common ingredient in paint removers. Important parameters relative to the suitability of a chemical protective material are breakthrough timeand exposure rate. Equations were provided that allow computation of theseparameters, and values were determined for seven common protective glove mate-rials. Only two materials {multilayered [poly(vinyl alcohol)/polyethylene] and Vitonrubber} were deemed satisfactory for this application. Materials for Integrated Circuit Packages Materials utilized for the integrated circuit package incorporating the leadframe design were the topic of the final case study. An IC chip is bonded to the lead-frame plate using either a eutectic solder or an epoxy resin. The leadframe ma-terial must be both electrically and thermally conductive, and, ideally, have acoefficient of thermal expansion that matches the IC chip material (i.e., siliconor gallium arsenide); copper alloys are commonly used leadframe materials. Verythin wires (preferably of gold, but often of copper or aluminum) are used to makeelectrical connections from the microscopic IC chip contact pads to the lead-frame. Ultrasonic microjoining welding/brazing techniques are used where eachconnection joint may be in the form of either a ball or wedge. The final step ispackage encapsulation, wherein this leadframe–wire–chip assembly is encased ina protective enclosure.

protective enclosure. Ceramic glasses and polymeric resins are the most com-mon encapsulation materials. Resins are less expensive than glasses and requirelower encapsulation temperatures; however, glasses normally offer a higher levelof protection.References •187 REFERENCES General Ashby, M.

it manufactures. Materialsengineering decisions have economic consequenceswith regard to both material and production costs. An awareness of environmental and societal issues is important for the engineer because, over time,greater demands are being made on the world’snatural resources. Furthermore, levels of pollution areever increasing. Materials engineering decisions have impacts on the consumption of raw materials andenergy, on the contamination of our water and at-mosphere, and on the ability of the consumer torecycle or dispose of spent products.

materials selectionprocess. Many of these selection criteria relate to material properties or propertycombinations—mechanical, electrical, thermal, corrosion, etc. ; the performance ofsome component will depend on the properties of the material from which it ismade. Processability or ease of fabrication of the component may also play a rolein the selection process. Virtually all of this book, in one way or another, hasaddressed these property and fabrication issues. In engineering practice there are other important criteria that must be consid- ered in the development of a marketable product. Some of these are economic innature, which, to some degree, are unrelated to scientific principles and engineeringpractice, and yet are significant if a product is to be competitive in the commercialmarketplace. Other criteria that should be addressed involve environmental andsocietal issues such as pollution, disposal, recycling, and energy. This final chapteroffers relatively brief overviews of economic, environmental, and societal consid-erations that are important in engineering practice. Economic Considerations It goes without saying that engineering practice involves utilizing scientific princi-ples to design components and systems that perform reliably and satisfactorily. An-other critical driving force in engineering practice is that of economics; simply stated,the company or institution must realize a profit from the products that it manu-factures and sells. The engineer might design the perfect component; however, asmanufactured, it must be offered for sale at a price that is attractive to the con-sumer and, in addition, return a suitable profit to the company. Only a brief overviewof important economic considerations as they apply to the materials engineer willbe provided. The student may want to consult references provided at the end ofthis chapter that address engineering economics in detail. There are three factors over which the materials engineer has control and that affect the cost of a product; they are (1) component design, (2) the material(s) used,and (3) the manufacturing technique(s) that are employed.

are employed. These factors are inter-related in that component design may affect which material is used, and both com-ponent design and the material used will influence the choice of manufacturingtechnique(s). Economic considerations for each of these factors is now brieflydiscussed.1496T_c23_192-201 11/4/05 13:39 •Chapter 23 / Economic, Environmental, and Societal Issues in Materials Science 23.2 COMPONENT DESIGN Some fraction of the cost of a component is associated with its design. In this con- text, component design is the specification of size, shape, and configuration, whichwill affect in-service component performance. For example, if mechanical forces arepresent, then stress analyses may be required. Detailed drawings of the componentmust be prepared; computers are normally employed, using software that has beengenerated for this specific function. It is often the case that a single component is part of a complex device or sys- tem consisting of a large number of components (i.e., the television, automobile,DVD player/recorder, etc.). Thus, design must take into consideration each com- ponent’s contribution to the efficient operation of the complete system. Component design is a highly iterative process that involves many compromises and trade-offs.The engineer should keep in mind that an optimal component designmay not be possible due to system constraints. 23.3 MATERIALS In terms of economics, we want to select the material or materials with the appro-priate combination(s) of properties that are the least expensive. Once a family ofmaterials has been selected that satisfy the design constraints, cost comparisons ofthe various candidate materials may be made on the basis of cost per part. Mater-ial price is usually quoted per unit mass. The part volume may be determined fromits dimensions and geometry, which is then converted into mass using the density ofthe material. In addition, during manufacturing there ordinarily is some unavoidablematerial waste, which should also be taken into account in these computations.

these computations. Cur-rent prices for a wide variety of engineering materials are contained in Appendix C. 23.4 MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES As already stated, the choice of manufacturing process will be influenced by both thematerial selected and part design.The entire manufacturing process will normally con-sist of primary and secondary operations. Primary operations are those that convertthe raw material into a recognizable part (i.e., casting, plastic forming, powder com-paction, molding, etc. ), whereas secondary ones are those subsequently employed toproduce the finished part (i.e., heat treatments, welding, grinding, drilling, painting, dec-orating). The major cost considerations for these processes include capital equipment,tooling, labor, repairs, machine downtime, and waste. Of course, within this cost analy-sis, rate of production is an important consideration. If this particular part is one com-ponent of a system, then assembly costs must also be addressed. Finally, there will un-doubtedly be costs associated with inspection and packaging of the final product. As a sidelight, there are also other factors not directly related to design, material, or manufacturing that figure into the product selling price. These factors includelabor fringe benefits, supervisory and management labor, research and development,property and rent, insurance, profit, taxes, and so on. Environmental and Societal Considerations Our modern technologies and the manufacturing of their associated products im-pact our societies in a variety of ways—some are positive, others are adverse. Fur-thermore, these impacts are economic and environmental in type, and international1496T_c23_192-201 11/4/05 13:39 .4 Manufacturing Techniques •195 in scope inasmuch as (1) the resources required for a new technology often come from many different countries, (2) the economic prosperity resulting from techno-logical development is global in extent, and (3) environmental impacts may extendbeyond the boundaries of a single country.

single country. Materials play a crucial role in this technology-economy-environment scheme. A material that is utilized in some end product and then discarded passes throughseveral stages or phases; these stages are represented in Figure 23.1, which is some-times termed the “total materials cycle” or just “materials cycle,” and representsthe “cradle-to-grave” life circuit of a material. Beginning on the far left side of Fig-ure 23.1, raw materials are extracted from their natural earthly habitats by mining,drilling, harvesting, and so on. These raw materials are then purified, refined, andconverted into bulk forms such as metals, cements, petroleum, rubber, and fibers.Further synthesis and processing results in products that are what may be termed“engineered materials”; examples include metal alloys, ceramic powders, glass, plas-tics, composites, semiconductors, and elastomers. Next, these engineered materialsare further shaped, treated, and assembled into products, devices, and appliancesthat are ready for the consumer—this constitutes the “product design, manufacture,assembly” stage of Figure 23.1. The consumer purchases these products and usesthem (the “applications” stage) until they wear out or become obsolete, and arediscarded. At this time the product constituents may either be recycled/reused(whereby they reenter the materials cycle) or disposed of as waste, normally beingeither incinerated or dumped as solid waste in municipal land-fills—as such, theyreturn to the earth and complete the materials cycle. It has been estimated that worldwide, on the order of 15 billion tons of raw ma- terials are extracted from the earth every year; some of these are renewable andsome are not. Over time, it is becoming more apparent that the earth is virtually aclosed system relative to its constituent materials and that its resources are finite.

Furthermore, energy must be supplied at each cycle stage; in the United States it has been estimated that approximately one-half of the energy consumed bymanufacturing industries goes to produce and fabricate materials. Energy is a re-source that, to some degree, is limited in supply, and measures must be taken toconserve and more effectively utilize it in the production, application, and disposalof materials. Finally, there are interactions with and impacts on the natural environment at all stages of the materials cycle. The condition of the earth’s atmosphere, water, andland depends to a large extent on how carefully we traverse this materials cycle.Some ecological damage and landscape spoilage undoubtedly result during the ex-traction of raw materials phase. Pollutants may be generated that are expelled intothe air and water during the synthesis and processing stage; in addition, any toxicchemicals that are produced need to be disposed of or discarded. The final prod-uct, device, or appliance should be designed so that during its lifetime, any impacton the environment is minimal; furthermore, that at the end of its life, provisionis made for recycling of its component materials, or at least for their disposal withlittle ecological degradation (i.e., it should be biodegradable).

be biodegradable). Recycling of used products rather than disposing of them as waste is a desirable approach for several reasons. First of all, using recycled material obviates the needto extract raw materials from the earth, and thus conserves natural resources andeliminates any associated ecological impact from the extraction phase. Second, en-ergy requirements for the refinement and processing of recycled materials are nor-mally less than for their natural counterparts; for example, approximately 28 timesas much energy is required to refine natural aluminum ores as to recycle aluminumbeverage can scrap. Finally, there is no need to dispose of recycled materials. Thus, this materials cycle (Figure 23.1) is really a system that involves interac- tions and exchanges among materials, energy, and the environment. In many countries, environmental problems and issues are being addressed by the establishment of standards that are mandated by governmental regulatory agen-cies. Furthermore, from an industrial perspective, it becomes incumbent for engi-neers to propose viable solutions to existing and potential environmental concerns. Correcting any environmental problems associated with manufacturing will in- fluence product price. That is, manufacturing cost is normally greater for a “green”(or “environmentally friendly”) product than for its equivalent that is produced un-der conditions wherein environmental issues are minimized. Thus, a company mustconfront the dilemma of this potential economic-environmental trade-off and thendecide the relative importance of economics and of environmental impact. One approach that is being implemented by industry to improve the envi- ronmental performance of products is termed life cycle analysis/assessment.W ith this approach to product design, consideration is given to the cradle-to-graveenvironmental assessment of the product, from material extraction to productmanufacture to product use, and, finally, to recycling and disposal; sometimes thisapproach is also labeled “green design.” One important phase of this approach isto quantify the various inputs (i.e., materials and energy) and outputs (i.e., wastes)for each phase of the life cycle; this is represented schematically in Figure 23.2.In addition, an assessment is conducted relative to the impact on both global andlocal environments in terms of the effects on the ecology, human health, andresource reserves.196 •Chapter 23 / Economic, Environmental, and Societal Issues in Materials Science 1496T_c23_192-201 11/4/05 13:39 .5 Recycling Issues in Materials Science and Engineering •197 23.5 RECYCLING ISSUES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING Important stages in the materials cycle where materials science and engineering plays a significant role are recycling and disposal.

and disposal. The issues of recyclability and dis-posability are important when new materials are being designed and synthesized.Furthermore, during the materials selection process, the ultimate disposition of thematerials employed should be an important criterion. Let us conclude this sectionby briefly discussing several of these recyclability/disposability issues. From an environmental perspective, the ideal material should be either totally recyclable or completely biodegradable. Recyclable means that a material, after hav-ing completed its life cycle in one component, could be reprocessed, could reenterthe materials cycle, and could be reused in another component—a process that couldbe repeated an indefinite number of times. By completely biodegradable, we meanthat, by interactions with the environment (natural chemicals, microorganisms, oxy-gen, heat, sunlight, etc. ), the material deteriorates and returns to virtually the samestate in which it existed prior to the initial processing. Engineering materials exhibitvarying degrees of recyclability and biodegradability. Metals Most metal alloys (i.e., Fe, Cu), to one degree or another experience corrosion andare also biodegradable. However, some metals (i.e., Hg, Pb) are toxic and, whenland-filled, may present health hazards. Furthermore, alloys of most metals are re-cyclable; on the other hand it is not feasible to recycle all alloys of every metal. In addition, the quality of alloys that are recycled tends to diminish with each cycle. Product designs should allow for the dismantling of components composed of different alloys. Another of the problems of recycling involves separation of vari-ous alloys types (i.e., aluminum from ferrous alloys) after dismantling and shred-ding; in this regard, some rather ingenious separation techniques have been devised(i.e., magnetic and gravity). Joining of dissimilar alloys presents contamination prob-lems; for example, if two similar alloys are to be joined, welding is preferred overbolting or riveting.

or riveting. Coatings (paints, anodized layers, claddings, etc.) may also actas contaminants, and render the material nonrecyclable.Figure 23.2 Schematic representation of an input/output inventory for the life-cycle assessment of a product.

Fortunately, however, they may be recycled; in fact, aluminum is the most impor- tant recyclable nonferrous metal. Since aluminum is not easily corroded, it may be totally reclaimed. A low ratio of energy is required to refine recycled aluminum rel-ative to its primary production. In addition, there are a large number of commer-cially available alloys that have been designed to accommodate impurity contami-nation. The primary sources of recycled aluminum are used beverage cans andscrapped automobiles. Glass The one ceramic material that is consumed by the general public in the greatest quantities is glass, in the form of containers. Glass is a relatively inert material, and,as such, it does not decompose; thus, it is not biodegradable. A significant propor-tion of municipal land-fills consists of waste glass; so also does incinerator residue. In addition, there is not a significant economic driving force for recycling glass. Its basic raw materials (sand, soda ash, and limestone) are inexpensive and readilyavailable. Furthermore, salvaged glass (also called “cullet”) must be sorted by color(clear, amber, and green), by type (plate versus container), and by composition (lime,lead, and borosilicate [or Pyrex]); these sorting procedures are time-consuming andexpensive.

time-consuming andexpensive. Therefore, scrap glass has a low market value, which diminishes its re-cyclability. Advantages of utilizing recycled glass include more rapid and increased production rates and a reduction in pollutant emissions. Plastics and Rubber One of the reasons that synthetic polymers (including rubber) are so popular as en-gineering materials lies with their chemical and biological inertness. On the downside, this characteristic is really a liability when it comes to waste disposal. Polymersare not biodegradable, and, as such, they constitute a significant land-fill compo-nent; major sources of waste are from packaging, junk automobiles, automobile tires,and domestic durables. Biodegradable polymers have been synthesized, but theyare relatively expensive to produce. On the other hand, since some polymers arecombustible and do not yield appreciable toxic or polluting emissions, they may bedisposed of by incineration. Thermoplastic polymers, specifically poly(ethylene terephthalate), polyethyl- ene, and polypropylene, are those most amenable to reclamation and recycling, sincethey may be reformed upon heating. Sorting by type and color is necessary. In somecountries, type sorting of packaging materials is facilitated using a number identi-fication code; for example, a “1” denotes high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Table23.1 presents these recycling code numbers and their associated materials. Also in-cluded in the table are uses of virgin and recycled materials. Plastics recycling iscomplicated by the presence of fillers (Section 15.21) that were added to modifythe original properties. The recycled plastic is less costly than the original material,and quality and appearance are generally degraded with each recycle. Typical ap-plications for recycled plastics include shoe soles, tool handles, and industrial prod-ucts such as pallets. The recycling of thermoset resins is much more difficult since these materials are not easily remolded or reshaped due to their crosslinked or network structures.Some thermosets are ground up and added to the virgin molding material prior toprocessing; as such, they are recycled as filler materials.

filler materials. Rubber materials present some disposal and recycling challenges. When vul- canized, they are thermoset materials, which makes chemical recycling difficult. In198 •Chapter 23 / Economic, Environmental, and Societal Issues in Materials Science 1496T_c23_192-201 11/4/05 13:39 .5 Recycling Issues in Materials Science and Engineering •199 addition, they may also contain a variety of fillers. The major source of rubber scrap in the United States is discarded automobile tires, which are highly nonbiodegrad-able. Scrap tires have been utilized as a fuel for some industrial applications (i.e.,cement plants), but yield dirty emissions. Recycled rubber tires that have been splitand reshaped are used in a variety of applications such as automotive bumperguards, mud flaps, door mats, and conveyor rollers; and, of course, used tires mayalso be recapped. In addition, rubber tires may be ground into small chunks thatare then recombined into the desired shape using some type of adhesive; the re-sulting material may be used in a number of nondemanding applications such asplace mats and rubber toys. The most viable recyclable alternatives to the traditional rubber materials are the thermoplastic elastomers (Section 15.19). Being thermoplastic in nature theyare not chemically crosslinked and, thus, are easily reshaped. Furthermore, pro-duction energy requirements are lower than for the thermoset rubbers since a vul-canization step is not required in their manufacture. Composite Materials Composites are inherently difficult to recycle because they are multiphase in na-ture. The two or more phases/materials that constitute the composite are normallyintermixed on a very fine scale and trying to separate them complicates the recy-cling process. However, some techniques have been developed, with modest success,Table 23.1 Recycle Codes, Uses of the Virgin Material, and Recycled Products for Several Commercial Polymers Recycle Code Polymer Name Uses of Virgin Material Recycled Products 1P oly(ethylene Plastic beverage containers, Liquid-soap bottles, strapping, fiberfill for terephthalate) mouthwash jars, peanut butter winter coats, surfboards, paint brushes, (PET or PETE) and salad dressing bottles fuzz on tennis balls, soft-drink bottles, film, egg cartons, skis, carpets, boats 2 High-density Milk, water and juice containers, Soft-drink bottle base caps, flower pots, polyethylene grocery bags, toys, liquid drain pipes, signs, stadium seats, trash (HDPE) detergent bottles cans, recycling bins, traffic-barrier cones, golf bag liners, detergent bottles, toys 3P oly(vinyl chloride) Clear food packaging, shampoo Floor mats, pipes, hose, mud flaps or vinyl (V) bottles 4 Low-density poly- Bread bags, frozen-food bags, Garbage can liners, grocery bags, ethylene (LDPE) grocery bags multipurpose bags 5P olypropylene (PP) Ketchup bottles, yogurt contain- Manhole steps, paint buckets, videocas- ers and margarine tubs, sette storage cases, ice scrapers, fast medicine bottles food trays, lawn mower wheels, automobile battery parts 6P olystyrene (PS) Videocassette cases, compact License plate holders, golf course and disc jackets, coffee cups; septic tank drainage systems, desktop knives, spoons, and forks; accessories, hanging files, food service cafeteria trays, grocery store trays, flower pots, trash cans, videocas-meat trays, and fast-food settes sandwich containers Source: American Plastics Council.1496T_c23_192-201 11/4/05 13:39 •Chapter 23 / Economic, Environmental, and Societal Issues in Materials Science for recycling polymer–matrix composites.

polymer–matrix composites. Recycling technologies will differ only slightly for thermoset–matrix and thermoplastic–matrix composite materials. The first step in recycling both thermoset– and thermoplastic–matrix compos- ites is shredding/grinding, wherein the components are reduced in size to relativelysmall particles. In some instances, these ground particles are used as filler materi-als that are blended with a polymer (and perhaps other fillers) before fabrication(usually using some type of molding technique) into postconsumer products. Otherrecycling processes allow for separating of the fibers and/or matrix materials. Withsome techniques the matrix is volatilized; with others it is recovered as a monomer.Of course, the recovered fibers have short lengths, as a result of the shredding/grind-ing process. In addition, fibers will experience a reduction of mechanical strength,the degree of which will depend on the specific recovery process as well as fibertype. REFERENCES White, J.A., K. E. Case, D. B.

disposal stages. Materials, energy, and environmentalinteractions/exchanges are important factors in the efficient operation of the ma-terials cycle. The earth is a closed system in that its materials resources are finite;to some degree, the same may be said of energy resources. Environmental issuesinvolve ecological damage, pollution, and waste disposal. Recycling of used productsand the utilization of green design obviate some of these environmental problems. Recycling Issues in Materials Science and Engineering Recyclability and disposability issues were addressed in the context of materials sci- ence and engineering. Ideally, a material should be at best recyclable, and at leastbiodegradable or disposable.

Base units are fundamental and not reducible. Table A.1 lists the base units of interest in the discipline of materials science and engineering. Derived units are expressed in terms of the base units, using mathematical signs for multiplication and division. For example, the SI units for density are kilogramper cubic meter (kg/m 3). For some derived units, special names and symbols exist; for example, N is used to denote the newton, the unit of force, which is equivalentto 1 kg-m/s Table A.2 contains a number of the important derived units. It is sometimes necessary, or convenient, to form names and symbols that are decimal multiples or submultiples of SI units. Only one prefix is used when a mul-tiple of an SI unit is formed, which should be in the numerator. These prefixes andtheir approved symbols are given in Table A.3.

Appendix B. The collection of valid cost data for ma- terials is an extremely difficult task, which explains the dearth of materials pricinginformation in the literature. One reason for this is that there are three pricing tiers:manufacturer, distributor, and retail. Under most circumstances, we have cited dis-tributor prices. For some materials (e.g., specialized ceramics such as silicon carbideand silicon nitride), it was necessary to use manufacturer’s prices. In addition, theremay be significant variation in the cost for a specific material. There are several rea-sons for this. First, each vendor has its own pricing scheme. Furthermore, cost willdepend on quantity of material purchased and, in addition, how it was processedor treated. We have endeavored to collect data for relatively large orders—-that is,quantities on the order of 900 kg (2000 lb m) for materials that are ordinarily sold in bulk lots—and, also, for common shapes/treatments. When possible, we obtainedprice quotes from at least three distributors/manufacturers. This pricing information was collected between May and August 1998. Cost data are in U.S. dollars per kilogram; in addition, these data are expressed as both priceranges and single-price values.The absence of a price range (i.e., when a single valueis cited) means that either the variation is small, or that, on the basis of limited data,it is not possible to identify a range of prices. Furthermore, inasmuch as materialprices change over time, it was decided to use a relative cost index; this index rep-resents the per-unit mass cost (or average per-unit mass cost) of a material dividedby the average per-unit mass cost of a common engineering material—A36 plaincarbon steel. Although the price of a specific material will vary over time, the priceratio between that material and another will, most likely, change more slowly.
