Principles of Planetary Climate R. T. Pierrehumbert March 12, 2006Preface When it comes to understanding the why’s and wherefores of climate, there is an inﬁnite amount one needs to know, but life aﬀords only a ﬁnite time in which to learn it; the time available before one’s fellowship runs out and a PhD thesis must be produced aﬀords still less. Inevitably, the student who wishes to get launched on signiﬁcant interdisciplinary problems must begin with a somewhat hazy sketch of the relevant physics, and ﬁll in the gaps as time goes on. It is a lifelong process. This book is an attempt to provide the student with a sturdy scaﬀolding upon which a deeper understanding may be hung later. The climate system is made up of building blocks which in themselves are based on el- ementary physical principles, but which have surprising and profound collective behavior when allowed to interact on the planetary scale. In this sense, the ”climate game” is rather like the game of Go, where interesting structure emerges from the interaction of simple rules on a big playing ﬁeld, rather than complexity in the rules themselves. This book is intended to provide a rapid entr´ ee into this fascinating universe of problems for the student who is already somewhat literate in physics and mathematics, but who has not had any previous experience with climate problems. The subject matter of each individual chapter could easily ﬁll a textbook many times over, but even the abbreviated treatment given here provides enough core material for the student to begin treating original questions in the physics of climate. This is a somewhat Earth-centric book, in that the Earth provides our best-observed example of a planetary climate. Nonetheless, the central organizing principle is the manner in which the interplay of the same basic set of physical building-blocks gives rise to the diverse climates of present, past and future Earth, of the other planets in the Solar system, and of hypothetical planets yet to be discovered.

be discovered. In this book I have chosen to deal only with aspects of climate that can be treated without consideration of the ﬂuid dynamics of the Atmosphere or Ocean. Many successful scientists have spent their entire careers productively in this sphere. A sequel will treat the additional phenomena that emerge when ﬂuid dynamics is introduced, culminating in a do-it-yourself General Circulation Model. The short exercises embedded in the text are meant to be done ”on the spot,” as an imme- diate check of comprehension. More involved and thought-provoking problems may be found in the accompanying Workbook. While the Workbook is never explicitly referred to in the text, it provides an integral part of the course. Using the techniques and tools developed in the Workbook, the student will be able to reproduce every single computational and data analysis result included in the text. The Workbook also oﬀers considerable opportunities for independent inquiry launching oﬀ from the results shown in the text. After having completed the course, the diligent student will be in posession of a tool kit that will be immediately useful in original research. In a modest way, the Workbook is intended to do for climate modelling what Numerical Recipes did for numerical iii analysis.Contents Preface i Contents 1 1 The Big Questions 3 1.1 Faint Young Sun and habitability of the Earth . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 1.2 Earth,Mars and Venus:The Goldilocks problem . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 1.3 The Proterozoic climate:Snowball Earth . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 1.4 Hothouse climates . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

next glaciation? Lifetime of the biosphere, as the Sun continues to warm. Will Earth turn into Venus? Will Mars bloom? What will happen to Titan as the solar system warms?Chapter 2 Thermodynamics in a Nutshell The atmospheres which are our principal objects of study are made of compressible gases. The compressibility has a profound eﬀect on the vertical proﬁle of temperature in these atmospheres. As things progress it will become clear that the vertical temperature variation in turn strongly inﬂuences the planet’s climate. To deal with these eﬀects it will be necessary to know some thermodynamics though just a little. This chapter does not purport to be a complete course in thermodynamics. It can only provide a summary of the key thermodynamic concepts and formulae needed to treat the basic problems of planetary climate. It is assumed that the student has obtained (or will obtain) a more fundamental understanding of the general subject of thermodynamics elsewhere. 2.1 A few observations The temperature proﬁle in Figure 2.1, measured in the Earth’s tropics introduces most of the features that are of interest in the study of general planetary atmospheres. It was obtained by releasing an instrumented balloon (radiosonde) which ﬂoats upwards from the ground, and sends back data on temperature and pressure as it rises. Pressure goes down monotonically with height, so the lower pressures represent greater altitudes. Pressure is a very natural vertical coordinate to use. Many devices for measuring atmo- spheric proﬁles directly report pressure rather than altitude, since the former is generally easier to measure. More importantly, most problems in the physics of climate require knowledge only of the variation of temperature and other quantities with pressure; there are relatively few cases for which it is necessary to know the actual height corresponding to a given pressure. Pressure is also important because it is one of the fundamental thermodynamic variables determining the state of the gas making up the atmosphere.

the atmosphere. Atmospheres in essence present us with a thermodynamic diagram conveniently unfolded in height. Throughout, we will use pressure (or its logarithm) as our fundamental vertical coordinate. However, for various reasons one might nevertheless want to know at what altitude a given pressure level lies. By altitude tracking of the balloon, or using the methods to be described in Section 2.2, the height of the measurement can be obtained in terms of the pressure.Figure 2.2 shows the relation between altitude and pressure for the sounding shown in Figure 2.1. One can see that the height is very nearly linearly related to the log of the pressure. This is the reason 56 CHAPTER 2.

If pois representative of the largest pressure of interest, then −ln(p/po) is a nice height-like coordinate, since it is positive and increases with height. We can now return to our discussion of the critical aspects of the temperature proﬁle.

temperature proﬁle. The most striking feature of the temperature sounding is that the temperature goes down with altitude. This is a phenomenon familiar to those who have experienced weather in high mountains, but the sounding shows that the temperature drop continues to altitudes much higher than sampled at any mountain peak. This sounding was taken over the Paciﬁc Ocean, so it also shows that the temperature drop has nothing to do with the presence of a mountain surface. The temperature drop continues until a critical height, known as the tropopause, and above that height (100mb, or 16 km in this sounding) begins to increase with height. The portion of the atmosphere below the tropopause is known as the troposphere, whereas the portion immediately above is the stratosphere. ”Tropo” comes from the Greek root for ”turning” (as in ”turning over”), while ”Strato..” refers to stratiﬁcation. The reasons for this terminology will become clear shortly. The stratosphere was discovered in 1900 by L` eon Phillipe Teisserenc de Bort, the French pioneer of instrumented balloon ﬂights. The sounding we have shown is typical. In fact, a similar pattern is encountered in the atmospheres of many other planets, as indicated in Figure 2.3 for Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Titan. In common with the Earth case, the lower portions of these atmospheres exhibits a sharp decrease of temperature with height, which gives way to a region of more gently decreasing, or even in- creasing, temperature at higher altitudes. The temperature decrease with height in the Earth’s atmosphere has long been known from experience of mountain weather. It became a target of quantitative investigation not long after the invention of the thermometer, and was early recog-8 CHAPTER 2. THERMODYNAMICS IN A NUTSHELL nized as a challenge to those seeking an understanding of the atmosphere.

the atmosphere. It was one of the central pre-occupations of the mountaineer and scientist Horace B´ en´ edict de Saussure (1740-1799). In the quest for an explanation, many false steps were taken, even by greats such as Fourier, before the correct answer was unveiled. As will be shown in the remainder of this chapter, some simple ideas based on thermodynamics and vertical mixing provide at least the core of an explanation for the temperature decrease with height. In Chapter 7 we will present a theory of tropopause height that similarly captures the essence of the problem. Nonetheless, some serious gaps remain in the state of understanding of the rate of decrease of temperature with height, and of the geographical dis- tribution of tropopause height. In Chapters 3 and 4 we will see that the energy budget of a planet is crucially aﬀected by the vertical structure of temperature; therefore, a thorough understanding of this feature is central to any theory of planetary climate. 2.2 Dry thermodynamics of an ideal gas 2.2.1 The equation of state for an ideal gas The three thermodynamic variables with which we will mainly be concerned are: temperature (denoted by T), pressure ( denoted by p) and density (denoted by ρ). Temperature is a measure of the amount of kinetic energy per molecule in the molecules making up the gas. We will always measure temperature in degrees Kelvin, which are the same as degrees Celsius (or Centigrade), except oﬀset so that absolute zero – the temperature at which molecular motion ceases – occurs at zero Kelvin. In Celsius degrees, absolute zero occurs at about -273.15C, which is then zero degrees Kelvin by deﬁnition. Pressure is a measure of the ﬂux of momentum per unit time carried by the molecules of the gas passing through an imaginary surface of unit area; equivalently, it is a measure of the force per unit area exerted on a surface in contact with the gas, in the direction perpendicular to the surface.

the surface. In the mks units we employ throughout this book , pressure is measured in Pascals (Pa); 1 Pascal is 1 Newton of force per square meter of area, or equivalently 1 kg/(ms2). For historical reasons, atmospheric pressures are often measured in ”bars” or ”millibars.” One bar, or equivalently 1000 millibars (mb) is approximately the mean sea-level pressure of the Earth’s current atmosphere. We will often lapse into using mb as units of pressure, because the unit sounds comfortable to atmospheric scientists. For calculations, though, it is important to convert millibars to Pascals. This is easy, because 1 mb = 100 Pa. Hence, we should all learn to say ”Hectopascal” in place of ”millibar.” It may take some time. When pressures are quoted in millibars or bars, one must make sure to convert them to Pascals before using the values in any thermodynamic calculations. Density is simply the mass of the gas contained in a unit of volume. In mks units, it is measured in kg/m3. For a perfect gas, the three thermodynamic variables are related by the perfect gas equation of state, which can be written p=ρR∗ MT (2.1) where R∗is the universal gas constant, which is independent of the gas in question, and Mis the molecular weight of the gas. We can deﬁne the gas constant R=R∗/Mpertinent to the gas in question. For example, dry Earth air has a mean molecular weight of 28.97, so Rdryair = 287m2/(s2deg−K), in mks units. Generally speaking, a gas obeys the perfect gas law when it is tenuous enough that the energy stored in forces between the molecules making up the gas is negligible.

is negligible. Deviations from the perfect gas law can be very important for the dense atmosphere of2.2.

The Venus and Mars data derive from observations of radio transmission through the atmosphere, taken by the Magellan and Global Surveyor orbiters, respectively. The Jupiter data derives from in situ deceleration measurements of the Galileo probe. The full Mars proﬁle dataset reveals considerable seasonal and geographical variation. The two proﬁles shown here were taken at latitudes near 30N, near dawn during the Northern Hemisphere Summer.The colder sounding was taken near dawn, and the warmer in the afternoon.10 CHAPTER 2. THERMODYNAMICS IN A NUTSHELL Venus, but for the purposes of the current atmosphere of Earth or Mars, or the upper part of the Jovian or Venusian atmosphere, the perfect gas law can be regarded as an accurate model of the thermodynamics– in fact, ”perfect,” one might say. An extension of the concept of a perfect gas is the law of partial pressures . This states that, in a mixture of gases in a given volume, each component gas behaves just as it would if it occupied the volume alone.

volume alone. The pressure due to one component gas is called the partial pressure of that gas. Consider a gas which is a mixture of substance A (with molecular weight MA) and substance B (with molecular weight MB). The partial pressures of the two gases are pA=RAρAT, pB=RBρBT (2.2) where RA=R∗/MAandRB=R∗/MB. The same temperature appears in both equations, since thermodynamic equilibrium dictates that all components of the system have the same temperature. Concentrations of atmospheric gases are often quoted in terms of ratios of partial pressures, often referred to as ”volumetric concentration”. In the above example, the volumetric concentration of A, measured in ”parts A per total parts of gas” would be pA/(pA+pB) The somewhat peculiar nomenclature arises because the ratio of pressures is also the ratio of the volumes each gas would have if allowed to attain a standard pressure and temperature ( po, To) in isolation. Similarly, because the number of molecules per unit volume of any substance with density ρand molecular weight Mis proportional toρ M, the volumetric concentration is equal to the ratio of the number of molecules of substance A to the total number of molecules of gas in the parcel. For substances with small concentrations, this ratio is often quoted as a percent or as parts per million by volume (ppmv) and so forth. Exercise 2.2.1 Use Equation 2.2 to demonstrate the assertions about volumetric concentration made in the preceding paragraph. The composition of a gas can alternatively be speciﬁed in terms of volumetric mixing ratios . The volumetric mixing ratio of substance Ato substance Bis simply pA/pB, with all equivalent interpretations discussed in the context of concentrations applying equally to this ratio. We will refer to volumetric mixing ratios interchangeably as ”molar” mixing ratios (i.e.

ratios (i.e. mixing ratios by count of molecules), and likewise for volumetric concentrations. The mass mixing ratio is the ratio of the mass of substance Ato that of substance Bin a given parcel of gas, and is ( MA/MB)(pA/pB). Throughout this book,we will use the symbol qto denote mass mixing ratios, with subscripts added as necessary to distinguish the species involved. Yet another measure of concentration is speciﬁc concentration by mass , deﬁned as the ratio of the mass of a given substance to the total mass of the parcel, for example ρCO2/ρtot for the case above. Using the law of partial pressures, the speciﬁc concentration by mass of substance A in a mixture is related to the volumetric concentration by ρA ρtot=MA MtotpA ptot(2.3) where Mtotis the mean molecular weight of the mixture. By convention, the term speciﬁc con- centration generally means speciﬁc concentration by mass (as opposed to molar or equivalently volumetric concentration deﬁned earlier). For example the term speciﬁc humidity always refers to the concentration of water vapor, or more generally another condensible substance, measured by mass of condensible substance to total mass of gas. Sometimes, where emphasis is desirable, we will nonetheless refer to ”mass speciﬁc concentration.”2.2. DRY THERMODYNAMICS OF AN IDEAL GAS 11 Exercise 2.2.2 Show that a mixture of gases with mass speciﬁc concentrations rA=ρA/(ρA+ρB) andrB=ρB/(ρA+ρB)behaves like a perfect gas with mean molecular weight 1/M=rA/MA+ rB/MB.

1/M=rA/MA+ rB/MB. (i.e. derive the expression relating total pressure pA+pBto total density ρA+ρBand identify the eﬀective gas constant). Compute the mean molecular weight of dry Earth air. (Dry Earth air is 78.084% N2, 20.947% O2, and .934% Ar by volume) All of the ratios we have just deﬁned are convenient to use because, unlike densities, they remain unchanged as a parcel of air expands or contracts, provided the constituents under consid- eration do not undergo condensation, chemical reaction or other forms of internal sources or sinks. Hence, for a compressible gas, two components A and B are well-mixed relative to each other if the mixing ratio between them is independant of position. Constituents will tend to become well mixed over a great depth of the atmosphere if they are created or destroyed slowly, if at all, relative to the characteristic time required for mixing. In the Earth’s atmosphere, the mixing ratio of oxygen to nitrogen is virtually constant up to about 80km above the surface. The mixing ratio of carbon dioxide in air can vary considerably in the vicinity of sources at the surface, such as urban areas where much fuel is burned, or under forest canopies when photosynthesis is active. Away from the surface, however, the carbon dioxide mixing ratio varies little. Variations of a few ppmv can be detected in the relatively slowly mixed stratosphere, associated with the industrial-era upward trend in fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions. Small sea- sonal and interhemispheric ﬂuctuations in the tropospheric mixing ratio, associated with variations in the surface sources, can also be detected. For most purposes, though, carbon dioxide can be regarded as well mixed throughout the atmosphere. Because it is condensible in the temperature range encountered in Earth’s climate, water vapor has a strong internal sink, and therefore shows very considerable vertical variations.

vertical variations. Carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia are not condensible on Earth at present, but their condensation can become signiﬁcant in colder planetary atmospheres. Exercise 2.2.3 (a) In the year 2000, the concentration of CO 2in the atmosphere was about 370 parts per million by volume (ppmv). What is the ratio pCO2/ptot? Does the volumetric concentra- tion diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the volumetric mixing ratio? What is the mass mixing ratio of CO 2in air? What is the mass mixing ratio of carbon (in the form of CO 2) in air – i.e. how many kilograms of carbon would have to be burned into CO 2in order to produce the CO 2in 1 kg of air? Note: The mean molecular weight of air is about 29. (b) Air is about 20% O2by volume. How many grams of O2does a 1 liter breath of air contain at sea level (1000mb)? At the top of Qomolangma (a.k.a. ”Mt. Everest,” about 300mb)? Does the temperature of the air (within reasonable limits) aﬀect your answer much? 2.2.2 Speciﬁc heat and conservation of energy Conservation of energy is one of the three great pillars upon which the ediﬁce of thermodynamics rests. When expressed in terms of changes in the state of matter, it is known as the /tieFirst Law of Thermodynamics. When a gas expands or contracts, it does work by pushing against the environment as its boundaries move. Since pressure is force per unit area, and work is force times distance, the work done in the course of an expansion of volume dVispdV. This is the amount of energy that must be added to the parcel of gas to allow the increase in volume to take place.

take place. For atmospheric purposes, it is more convenient to do write all thermodynamic relations on a per unit mass basis. Dividing Vby the mass contained in the volume yields ρ−1, whence the work per unit mass is pdρ−1. This is not the end of energy accounting. Changing the temperature of a unit mass of the substance while holding volume ﬁxed changes the energy stored in the various motions12 CHAPTER 2. THERMODYNAMICS IN A NUTSHELL of the molecules by an amount cvdT, where cvis a proportionality factor known as the speciﬁc heat at constant volume . For example it takes about 720 Joules of energy to raise the temperature of 1kg of air by 1K while holding the volume ﬁxed. For ideal gases, the speciﬁc heat can depend on temperature, though the dependence is typically weak. For non-ideal gases, speciﬁc heat can depend on pressure as well. Exercise 2.2.4 There are 20 students and one professor in a well-insulated classroom measuring 20 meters by 20 meters by 3 meters. Each person in the classroom puts out energy at a rate of 100 Watts (1 Watt = 1 Joule/second). The classroom is dark, except for a computer and LCD projector which together consume power at a rate of 200 Watts. The classroom is ﬁlled with air at a pressure of 1000mb (no extra charge). How much does the temperature of the classroom rise during the course of a 1 hour lecture? Combining the two contributions to energy change we ﬁnd the expression for the amount of energy that must be added per unit mass in order to accomplish a change of both temperature and volume: δQ=cvdT+pdρ−1(2.4) Using the perfect gas law, the heat balance can be re-written in the form δQ=cvdT+d(pρ−1)−ρ−1dp= (cv+R)dT−ρ−1dp (2.5) From this relation, we can identify the speciﬁc heat at constant pressure ,cp≡cv+R, which is the amount of energy needed to warm a unit mass by 1K while allowing it to expand enough to keep pressure constant.

pressure constant. The units in which we measure temperature are an artifact of the marks one researcher or other once decided to put on some device that responded to heat and cold. Since temperature is proportional to the energy per molecule of a substance, it would make sense to set the propor- tionality constant to unity and simply use energy as the measure of temperature. This not being common practice, one has occasion to make use of the Boltzmann thermodynamic constant ,k, which expresses the proportionality between temperature and energy. More precisely, each degree of freedom in a system with temperature Thas a mean energy1 2kT. For example, a gas made of rigid spherical atoms has three degrees of freedom per atom (one for each direction it can move), and therefore each atom has energy3 2kTon average; a molecule which could store energy in the form of rotation or vibration would have more degrees of freedom, and therefore each molecule would have more energy at any given temperature. The energy-temperature relation is made pos- sible by an important thermodynamic principle, the equipartion principle , which states that in equilibrium, each degree of freedom accessible to a system gets an equal share of the total energy of the system. In constrast to physical constants like the speed of light, the Boltzmann constant should not be considered a fundamental constant of the Universe. It is just a unit conversion factor. 2.2.3 Entropy, reversibility and Potential temperature; The Second Law One cannot use Eqn 2.5 to deﬁne a ”heat content” Qof a state ( p, T) relative to a reference state (po, To), because the amount of heat needed to go from one state to another depends on the path in pressure-temperature space taken to get there; the right hand side of Eqn 2.5 is not an exact diﬀerential. However, it can be made into an exact diﬀerential by dividing the equation by Tand2.2.

by Tand2.2. DRY THERMODYNAMICS OF AN IDEAL GAS 13 using the perfect gas law as follows: ds≡δQ T=cpdT T−Rdp p=cpdln(Tp−R/cp) (2.6) assuming cpto be constant. This equation deﬁnes the entropy ,s≡cpln (Tp−R/cp). (Entropy can still be deﬁned if cpis not constant, but the expression is somewhat more complicated and need not concern us for the moment.) Entropy is a nice quantity to work with because it is a state variable – its change between two states is independent of the path taken to get from one to the other. A process aﬀecting a parcel of matter is said to be adiabatic if it occurs without addition or loss of heat from the parcel. By deﬁnition, δQ= 0 for adiabatic processes. In consequence, adiabatic processes leave entropy unchanged. They are reversible . Entropy can also be deﬁned for gases whose speciﬁc heat depends on temperature and pressure, and for non-ideal gases, but the expression is more complicated. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that entropy never decreases for energetically closed systems – systems to which energy is neither added nor subtracted in the course of their evo- lution. The formal derivation of the law from the microscopic properties of molecular interactions is in many ways an unﬁnished work of science, but the tendency towards an increase in entropy – an increase in disorder – seems to be a nearly universal property of systems consisting of a great many interacting components. The Second Law is perhaps more intuitive when restated in the following way: In an energetically closed system, heat ﬂows from a hotter part of the system to a colder part of the system, causing the system to evolve toward a state of uniform temperature.

uniform temperature. To see that this statement is equivalent to the entropy-increase principle, consider a thermally insulated box of gas having uniform pressure, but within which the left half of the mass is at temperature T1and the right half of the mass is at temperature T2< T1. Now suppose that we transfer an amount of heat δQfrom the left half of the box to the right half. This transfer leaves the net energy unchanged, but it changes the entropy. Speciﬁcally, according to Eq. 2.6, the entropy change summed over the two halves of the gas is ds= (1 T2−1 T1)δQ. Since T2< T 1, this change is positive only if δQ > 0, representing a transfer from the hotter to the colder portion of the gas. Entropy can be increased by further heat transfers until T1=T2, at which point the maximum entropy state has been attained. The Second Law endows the Universe with an arrow of time. If one watches a movie of a closed system and sees that the system starts with large ﬂuctuations of temperature (low entropy) and proceeds to a state of uniform temperature (high entropy), one knows that time is running forward. If one sees a thermally homogeneous object spontaneously generate large temperature inhomogeneities, then one knows that the movie is being run backwards. Note that the Second Law applies only to closed systems. The entropy of a subcomponent can decrease, if it exchanges energy with the outside world and increases the entropy of the rest of the Universe. This is how a refrigerator works. Entropy can also be used to determine how the temperature of an air parcel changes when it is compressed or expanded adiabatically. This is important because it tells us what happens to temperature is a bit of the atmosphere is lifted from low altitudes (where the pressure is high) to higher altitudes (where the pressure is lower), provided the lifting occurs so fast that the air parcel has little time to exchange heat with its surroundings.

its surroundings. If the initial temperature and pressure are (T, p), then conservation of entropy tells us that the temperature Tofound upon adiabatically compressing or expanding to pressure pois given by Tp−R/cp=Top−R/cpo This leads us to deﬁne thepotential temperature θ=T(p po)−R/cp(2.7)14 CHAPTER 2.

Like entropy, potential temperature is conserved for adiabatic processes. To understand why the presence of cold air above warm air in the sounding of Figure 2.1 does not succumb immediately to instability, we need only look at the corresponding proﬁle of potential temperature, shown in Figure 2.4. This ﬁgure shows that potential temperature increases monotonically with height. This proﬁle tells us that the air aloft is cold, but that if it were pushed down to lower altitudes, compression would warm it to the point that it is warmer than the surrounding air, and thus being positively buoyant, will tend to ﬂoat back up to its original level rather than continuing its descent. We see also where the stratosphere gets its name: potential temperature increases very strongly with height there, so air parcels are very resistant to vertical displacement. This part of the atmosphere is therefore strongly stratiﬁed. The troposphere is stable, but has much weaker gradients of θ.

of θ. In a compressible atmosphere, a well-stirred layer would have constant θrather than constant T, since it is the former that is conserved for adiabatic processes such as would be caused by rapid vertical displacements. This is the essence of the explanation for why temperature decreases with height: turbulent stirring relaxes the troposphere towards constant θ, yielding the dry adiabat T(p) =θ·(p po)R/cp(2.8) In this formula, θhas the constant value T(po). If we introduce the new vertical coordinate ζ=−ln(p/po), then Equation 2.8 can be re-written T(p) =T(po)exp(−(R/cp)ζ), from which we see that a dry adiabat shows up as a straight line on a plot of the logarithm of temperature vs. the logarithm of pressure.2.2.

Latent heats of vaporization are given at the temperature where vapor pressure reaches 1 bar, except in the case of water, where the value is speciﬁed at the triple point. For pressures, ”b” stands for units in bars while ”mb” stands for units in millibars. All other units are mks. It is evident from Figure 2.4 that something prevents θfrom becoming completely well mixed. An equivalent way of seeing this is to compare the observed temperature proﬁle with the dry adiabat. For example, if the air at 1000mb in Figure 2.4, having temperature 298K, were lifted dry-adiabatically to the tropopause, where the pressure is 100mb, then the temperature would be 298. (100 1000)2/7, i.e. 154.3K (using the value R/cp= 2/7 for Earth air). This is much colder than the observed temperature, which is 188K. We will see shortly that in the Earth’s atmosphere, condensation of water vapor is one of the factors in play, though it is not the only one aﬀecting the tropospheric temperature proﬁle.

temperature proﬁle. The question of what determines the tropospheric θgradient is at present still largely unsettled, particularly outside the Tropics. It is no accident that the value of R/cpfor air lies close to the ratio of two small integers. It is a consequence of the equipartition principle. Using methods of statistical thermodynamics, it can be shown that a gas made up of molecules with ndegrees of freedom has R/cp= 2/(n+ 2). Using the expression for the gas constant in terms of the speciﬁc heats, the adiabatic coeﬃcient can also be written as R/cp= 1−1/γ, where γ=cp/cv; for exact equipartion, γ= 1 + 2 /n. The measured values of γfor a few common atmospheric gases are shown in Table 2.1. Helium comes close to the theoretical value for a molecule with no internal degrees of freedom, underscoring that excitation of electron motions plays little role in heat storage for typical planetary temperatures. The diatomic molecules have values closest to the theoretical value for n= 5, one short of what one would expect from adding two rotational and one vibrational internal degrees of freedom. Among the triatomic molecules, water acts roughly as if it had n= 6 while carbon dioxide is closer to n= 7. The two most complex molecules, methane and ammonia, are also characterized by n= 7. The failure of thermodynamics to access all the degrees of freedom classically available to a molecule is a consequence of quantum theory. Since the energy stored in states of motion of a molecule in fact comes in discrete-sized chunks, or ”quanta,” one can have a situation where a molecule hardly ever gets enough energy from a collision to excite even a single vibrational degree of freedom, for example, leading to the phenomenon of partial excitation or even non-excitation of certain classical degrees of freedom.

of freedom. This is one of many ways that the quantum theory, operating on exceedingly tiny spatial scales, exerts a crucial control over macroscopic properties of matter that can eﬀect the very habitability of the Universe. Generally speaking, the higher the temperature gets, the more easy it is to excite internal degrees of freedom, leading to a decrease in γ. This quantum eﬀect is the chief reason that speciﬁc heats vary somewhat with temperature.16 CHAPTER 2. THERMODYNAMICS IN A NUTSHELL Exercise 2.2.5 (a) A commercial jet airliner cruises at an altitude of 300mb. The air outside has a temperature of 240K. To enable the passengers to breathe, the ambient air is compressed to a cabin pressure of 1000mb. What would the cabin temperature be if the air were compressed adiabatically? How do you think airlines deal with this problem? (b) Discuss whether the lower portion of the Venus temperature proﬁle shown in Figure 2.3 is on the dry CO 2adiabat. (c) Assume that the Jupiter sounding is on a dry adiabat, and estimate the value of R/cpfor the atmosphere. Based on your result, what is the dominant constituent of the Jovian atmosphere likely to be? What other gas might be mixed with the dominant one? 2.3 Static stability of inhomogeneous mixtures An atmosphere is statically unstable if an air parcel displaced from its original position tends to continue rising or sinking instead of returning to its original position. Such a state will tend to mix itself until it becomes stable. For a well-mixed atmosphere, the potential temperature proﬁle tells the whole story about static stability, since, according to the ideal gas law, the density of an air parcel with potential temperature θ0will be ρ0=p1/(Rθ0·(p1/p0)R/cp) upon being elevated to an altitude with pressure p1< p0.

p1< p0. The ambient density there is ρ1==p1/(Rθ1·(p1/p0)(R/cp)). The displaced parcel will be negatively buoyant and return toward its original position if ρ0> ρ1, which is true if and only if θ0< θ1, i.e. if the potential temperature increases with height. For an inhomogeneous atmosphere, this is no longer the case, since the gas constant Rdepends on the mean molecular weight of the mixture, which varies from place to place. As an example, we may consider an atmosphere which has uniform θ, but which consists of pure N2forp > p 0and pure CO2forp < p 0. In this case, the diﬀerence in density between a lifted N2parcel and that of the surrounding CO2is ρ0−ρ1=1 θ(1 RN2(p1/p0)−(R/cp)N2−1 RCO2(p1/p0)−(R/cp)CO2) (2.9) The value of R/cpdiﬀers somewhat between N2andCO2but the main eﬀect in this equation comes from the diﬀering values of the gas constant. Since N2has lower molecular weight (28) than CO2(44), the gas constant for N2is considerably greater than the gas constant for CO2. In consequence, ρ0< ρ 1, the lifted nitrogen parcel is positively buoyant, and the nitrogen layer will tend to spontaneously mix itself with the CO2layer despite the fact that both have the same potential temperature. The phenomenon is very familiar: it is why helium balloons rise in air, even when they are at the same temperature as their surroundings. The low molecular weight of helium makes it lighter (i.e. lower density) than air having the same temperature and pressure.

and pressure. Exercise 2.3.1 Make sense of the following statement: ”For the Earth’s atmosphere, moist air is lighter than dry air.” Would this still be true for a planet whose atmosphere is mainly H2? There are a number of ways to deal with the eﬀect of composition on static stability. For the case of moisture on the Earth, it is common to deﬁne a virtual temperature , which is the temperature at which the gas law for dry air would yield the same density as the true gas law taking into account the lightening eﬀect of water vapor. This approach has its virtues, but we ﬁnd it less confusing to deal instead with potential density , which is the density an air parcel would have if reduced adiabatically to a standard reference pressure. Using the gas law, and the fact that mixing ratios are conserved (whence R/cpis conserved on adiabatic compression of the parcel),2.4. THE HYDROSTATIC RELATION 17 the potential density is ρp=po Rθ=po RT(p po)R/cp(2.10) From this equation it is evident that for a well-mixed system, Ris independent of p, so that the system is stable precisely when θincreases with height. For an inhomogeneous mixture, the variations in Rassociated with varying composition can stabilize or destabilize the system. The variations in cpcan have a similar, though generally less pronounced, eﬀect. 2.4 The hydrostatic relation The hydrostatic relation relates pressure to altitude and the mass distribution of the atmosphere, and provides the chief reason that pressure is the most natural vertical coordinate to use in most atmospheric problems. Consider a column of any substance at rest, and suppose that the density of the substance as a function of height zis given by ρ(z). Suppose further that the range of altitudes being considered is small enough that the acceleration of gravity is essentially constant; The magnitude of this acceleration will be called g, and the force of gravity is taken to point along the direction of decreasing z.

decreasing z. Now, consider a slice of the column with vertical thickness dz, having cross sectional area Ain the horizontal direction. Since pressure is simply force per unit area, then the change in pressure from the base of this slice to the top of this slice is just the force exerted by the mass. By Newton’s law, then, we have Adp=−Agdm =−Agρdz (2.11) where dmis the increment of mass in the column per unit area. An immediate consequence of this relation is that dm=−dp g(2.12) which states that the amount of mass in a slab of atmosphere is proportional to the thickness of that slab, measured in pressure coordinates. A further consequence, upon dividing by dzis the relationdp dz=−ρg (2.13) This diﬀerential equation expresses the hydrostatic relation . It is exact if the substance is at rest (hence the ”static”), but if the material of the column is in motion, the relation is still approximately satisﬁed provided the acceleration is suﬃciently small, compared to the acceleration of gravity. In practice, the hydrostatic relation is very accurate for most problems involving large scale motions in planetary atmospheres. It would not be a good approximation within small scale intense updrafts or downdrafts where the acceleration of the ﬂuid may be large. Derivation of the precise conditions under which the hydrostatic approximation holds requires consideration of the equations of ﬂuid motion, which will be taken up in a sequel to the present book. An important consequence of the hydrostatic relation is that it enables us to determine the total mass of an atmosphere through measurements of pressure taken at the surface alone. Integrating Eqn 2.12 from the ground ( p=ps) to space ( p= 0) yields the relation m=ps g(2.14) where mis the total mass of the atmosphere located over a unit area of the planet’s surface.

planet’s surface. Note that this relation presumes that the depth of the layer containing almost all the mass of the18 CHAPTER 2. THERMODYNAMICS IN A NUTSHELL atmosphere is suﬃciently shallow that gravity can be considered constant throughout the layer. Given that gravity decays inversely with the square of distance from the planet’s center, this is equivalent to saying that the atmosphere must be shallow compared to the radius of the planet. For a well mixed substance A with mass-speciﬁc concentration κArelative to the whole atmosphere, the mass of substance A per square meter of the planet’s surface is just mκA Using the perfect gas law to eliminate ρfrom Eqn 2.13 yields dp dz=−g RTp (2.15) where Ris the gas constant for the mixture making up the atmosphere. This has the solution p(z) =psexp(−g R¯Tz),¯T(z) = (1 z/integraldisplayz 0T−1dz)−1(2.16) Here, ¯T(z) is the harmonic mean of temperature in the layer between the ground and altitude z. If temperature is constant, then pressure decays exponentially with scale height RT/g . Because temperature is measured relative to absolute zero, the mean temperature ¯T(z) can be relatively constant despite fairly large variations of temperature within the layer. In consequence, pressure typically decays roughly exponentially with height even when temperature is altitude-dependent. Exercise 2.4.1 Compute the mass of the Earth’s atmosphere, assuming a mean surface pressure of 1000mb. (The Earth’s radius is 6378km, and the acceleration of its gravity is 9.8m/s2). Compute the mass of the Martian atmosphere, assuming a mean surface pressure of 6mb. (Mars’ radius is 3390km, and the acceleration of its gravity is 3.7m/s2.)

is 3.7m/s2.) Note that the hydrostatic relation applies only to the total pressure of all constituents; it does not apply to partial pressures individually. However, in the special case in which the gases are well mixed, the total mass of each well-mixed component can still be determined from surface data alone. One simply multiplies the total mass obtained from surface pressure, by the appropriate (constant) mass-speciﬁc concentration. In the study of atmospheric dynamics, the hydrostatic equation is used to compute the pressure gradients which drive the great atmospheric circulations. Outside of dynamics, there are rather few problems in physics of climate that require one to know the altitude corresponding to a given pressure level. Our main use of the hydrostatic relation in this book will be in the form of Eqn 2.12, which tells us the mass between two pressure surfaces. The hydrostatic relation also allows us to derive a useful alternate form of the heat budget, by re-writing the heat balance equation as follows: δQ=cpdT−ρ−1dp=cpdT−ρ−1dp dzdz=d(cpT+gz) (2.17) assuming cpto be constant. The quantity cpT+gzis known as the dry static energy . Dry static energy provides a more convenient basis for atmospheric energy budgets than entropy, since changes in dry static energy following an air parcel are equal to the net energy added to or removed from the parcel by heat sources such as solar radiation. 2.5 Thermodynamics of phase change When a substance changes from one form to another (e.g. water vapor condensing into liquid water or gaseous carbon dioxide condensing into dry ice) energy is released or absorbed even if2.5. THERMODYNAMICS OF PHASE CHANGE 19 the temperature of the mass is unchanged after the transformation has taken place. This happens because the amount of energy stored in the form of intermolecular interactions is generally diﬀerent from one form, or phase to another.

to another. The amount of energy released when a unit of mass of a substance changes from one phase to another, holding temperature constant, is known as the latent heat associated with that phase change. By convention, latent heats are stated as positive numbers, with the phase change going in the direction that releases energy. Phase changes are reversible . If one kilogram of matter releases Ljoules of energy in going from phase A to phase B, it will take the same Ljoules of energy to turn the mass back into phase A. The units of latent heat are energy per unit mass (Joules per kilogram in mks units). Condensible substances play a central role in the atmospheres of many planets and satellites. On Earth, it is water that condenses, both into liquid water and ice. On Mars, CO2condenses into dry ice in clouds and in the form of frost at the surface. On Jupiter and Saturn, not only water but ammonia ( NH 3) and a number of other substances condense. The thick clouds of Venus are composed of condensed sulfuric acid. On Titan it is methane, and on Neptune’s moon Triton nitrogen itself condenses. Table 2.1 lists the latent heats for the liquid-vapor (evaporation), liquid- solid (fusion) and solid-vapor (sublimation) phase transitions are given for a number of common constituents of planetary atmospheres. Water has an unusually large latent heat; the condensation of 1 kg of water vapor into ice releases ﬁve times as much energy as the condensation of 1kg of carbon dioxide gas into dry ice. This is why the relatively small amount of water vapor in Earth’s present atmosphere can nonetheless have a great eﬀect on atmospheric structure and dynamics. Ammonia also has an unusually large latent heat, though not so much so as water. In both cases, the anomalous latent heat arises from the considerable energy needed to break hydrogen bonds in the condensed phase.

condensed phase. Like most thermodynamic properties, latent heat varies somewhat with temperature. For example, the latent heat of vaporization of water is 2 .5·106J/kg at 0C, but only 2 .26·106J/kg at 100C. For precise calculations, the variation of latent heat must be taken into account, but nonetheless for many purposes it will be suﬃcient to assume latent heat to be constant over fairly broad temperature ranges. The three main phases of interest are solid, liquid and gas (also called vapor), though other phases can be important in exotic circumstances. There is generally a triple point in temperature- pressure space where all three phases can co-exist. Above the triple point temperature, the substance undergoes a vapor-liquid phase transition as temperature is decreased or pressure is increased; below the triple point temperature vapor condenses directly into solid, once thermo- dynamic equilibrium has been attained. For water, the triple point occurs at a temperature of 273.15K and pressure of 6.11mb (see Table 2.1 for other gases). Generally, the triple point temper- ature can also be taken as an approximation to the ”freezing point” – the temperature at which a liquid becomes solid – because the freezing temperature varies only weakly with pressure until very large pressures are reached. Though we will generally take the freezing point to be identical to the triple point in our discussions, the eﬀect of pressure on freezing of liquid can nonetheless be of great importance at the base of glaciers and in the interior of icy planets or moons, and perhaps also in very dense,cold atmospheres. Typically, the solid phase is more dense than the liquid phase, but water again is exceptional. Water ice ﬂoats on liquid water, whereas carbon dioxide ice would sink in an ocean of liquid carbon dioxide, and methane ice would sink in a methane lake on Titan. This has profound consequences for the climates of planets with a water ocean such as Earth has, since ice formed in winter remains near the surface where it can be more readily melted when summer arrives.

summer arrives. Exercise 2.5.1 Per square meter, how many Joules of energy would be required to evaporate a20 CHAPTER 2. THERMODYNAMICS IN A NUTSHELL puddle of Methane on Titan, having a depth of 20m? Atmospheres can transport energy from one place to another by heating an air parcel by an amount δT, moving the parcel vertically or horizontally, and then cooling it down to its original temperature. This process moves an amount of heat cpδTper unit mass of the parcel. Latent heat provides an alternate way to transport energy, since energy can be used to evaporate liquid into an air parcel until its mixing ratio increases by δq, moving it and then condensing the substance until the mixing ratio returns to its original value. This process transports an amount of heat Lδqper unit mass of the planet’s uncondensible air, and can be much more eﬀective at transporting heat than inducing temperature ﬂuctuations, especially when the latent heat is large. ”Ordinary” heat – the kind that feels hot when you touch it, and which is stored in the form of the temperature increase of a substance – is known in atmospheric circles as ”sensible” heat. All gases are condensible at low enough temperatures or high enough pressures. On Earth (in the present climate) CO2is not a condensible substance, but on Mars it is. The ability of a gas to condense is characterized by the saturation vapor pressure ,psatof that gas, which may be a function of any number of thermodynamic variables. When the partial pressure pAof gas A is below psat,A, more of the gas can be added, raising the partial pressure, without causing condensation. However, once the partial pressure reaches psat,A, any further addition of A will condense out. The state pA=psat,A is referred to as ”saturated” with regard to substance A.

substance A. Each condensed state (e.g. liquid or solid) will have its own distinct saturation vapor pressure. Rather remarkably, for a mixture of perfect gases, the saturation vapor pressure of each component is independent of the presence of the other gases. Water vapor mixed with 1000 mb worth of dry air at a temperature of 300K will condense when it reaches a partial pressure of 38mb; a box of pure water vapor at 300K condenses at precisely the same 38mb. If a substance ”A” has partial pressure pAthat is below the saturation vapor pressure, it is said to be ”subsaturated,” or ”unsaturated.” The degree of subsaturation is measured by the saturation ratio pa/psat,A, which is often stated as a percent. Applied to water vapor, this ratio is called the relative humidity , and one often speaks of the relative humidity of other substances, e.g. ”methane relative humidity” instead of saturation ratios. Note that the relative humidity is also equal to the mixing ratio of the substance Ain a given mixture to the mixing ratio the air would have if the substance were saturated. This is diﬀerent from the ratio of speciﬁc humidity tosaturation speciﬁc humidity , or the ratio of molar concentration tosaturation molar concentration except when the mixing ratio is small. It is intuitively plausible that the saturation vapor pressure should increase with increasing temperature, as molecules move faster at higher temperatures, making it harder for them to stick together to form condensate. The temperature dependence of saturation vapor pressure is expressed by a remarkable thermodynamic relation known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation . It is derived from very general thermodynamic principles, via a detailed accounting of the work done in an reversible expansion-contraction cycle crossing the condensation threshold, and requires neither approximation nor detailed knowledge of the nature of the substance condensing.

The relation reads dpsat dT=1 TL ρ−1v−ρ−1c(2.18) where ρvis the density of the vapor phase, ρcis the density of the condensed phase, and L is the latent heat associated with the transformation to the condensed phase. For vapor to liquid or solid transitions, ρc/greatermuchρv, enabling one to ignore the second term in the denominator of Eqn 2.18. Further, upon substituting for density from the perfect gas law, one obtains the simpliﬁed form dpsat dT=L RAT2psat (2.19)2.5.

If we make the approximation that Lis constant, then Eqn 2.18 can be integrated analytically, resulting in psat(T) =psat(To)e−L RA(1 T−1 To)(2.20) where Tois some reference temperature. This equation shows that saturation water vapor content is very sensitive to temperature, decaying rapidly to zero as temperature is reduced and increasing rapidly as temperature is increased. The rate at which the change occurs is determined by the characteristic temperatureL RAappearing in the exponential. For the transition of water vapor to liquid, it has the value 5420K at temperatures near 300K.

near 300K. For CO2gas to dry ice, it is 4060K, and for methane gas to liquid methane it is 980K. Equation 2.19 seems to imply that the psat asymptotes to a constant value when T/greatermuchL/R A. This is a spurious limit, though, since the assumption of constant Linvariably breaks down over such large temperature ranges. In fact, Ltypically approaches zero at some critical temperature , where the distinction between the two phases disappears. For water vapor, this critical point occurs at a temperature and pressure of 647.1K and 221bars. For carbon dioxide, the critical point occurs for the vapor-liquid transition, at 304.2K and 73.825 bars. Critical points for other atmospheric gases are shown in Table 2.1. Below the triple point temperature, the favored transition is gas/solid,and so the appropriate latent heat to use in the Clausius-Clapeyron relation is the latent heat of sublimation. Above the triple point, the favored transition is gas/liquid, whence one should use the latent heat of vaporization. The triple point ( T, p) provides a convenient base for use with the simpliﬁed Clausius- Clapeyron solution in Eqn. 2.20, or indeed for any numerical integration of the relation with variable L. Results for water vapor are shown in Figure 2.5. These results were computed using the constant Lapproximation for sublimation and vaporization, but in fact a plot of the empirical results on a logarithmic plot of this type would not be distinguishable from the curves shown. The more exact result does diﬀer from the constant Lidealization by a few percent, which can be important in some applications. Be that as it may, the ﬁgure reveals the extreme sensitivity of vapor pressure to temperature. The vapor pressure ranges from about .1 Pascals at 200K (the22 CHAPTER 2.

CHAPTER 2. THERMODYNAMICS IN A NUTSHELL tropical tropause temperature) to 35mb at a typical tropical surface temperature of 300K, rising further to 100mb at 320K. Over this span of temperatures, water ranges from a trace gas to a major constituent; at temperatures much above 320K, it rapidly becomes the dominant constituent of the atmosphere. Note also that the distinction between the ice and liquid phase transitions has a marked eﬀect on the vapor pressure. Because the latent heat of sublimation is larger than the latent heat of vaporization, the vapor pressure over ice is lower than the vapor pressure over liquid would be, at subfreezing temperatures. At 200K, the ratio is nearly a factor of three. Exercise 2.5.2 Let’s consider once more the case of the airliner cruising at an altitude of 300mb, discussed in an earlier Exercise. Suppose that the ambient air at ﬂight level has 100% relative humidity. What is the relative humidity once the air has been brought into the cabin, compressed to 1000mb, and chilled to a room temperature of 290K? Once the saturation vapor pressure is known, one can compute the volumetric or mass mixing ratios with respect to the background non-condensible gas, if any, just as for any other pair of gases. The saturation vapor pressure is used in this calculation just like any other partial pressure. For example, the volumetric mixing ratio is just psat/pa, ifpais the partial pressure of the noncondensible background. Note that, while the saturation vapor pressure is independent of the pressure of the gas with which the condensible substance is mixed, the saturation mixing ratio is not. Exercise 2.5.3 What is the saturation volumetric mixing ratio of water vapor in air at the ground in tropical conditions (1000mb and 300K)? What is the mass mixing ratio? What is the mass- speciﬁc humidity?

speciﬁc humidity? What is the volumetric mixing ratio (in ppmv) of water vapor in air at the tropical tropopause (100mb and 200K)? 2.6 The moist adiabat When air is lifted, it cools by adiabatic expansion, and if it gets cold enough that one of the components of the atmosphere begins to condense, latent heat is released. This makes the lifted air parcel warmer than the dry adiabat would predict. The resulting temperature proﬁle will be referred to as the moist adiabat , regardless of whether the condensing substance is water vapor (as on Earth) or something else ( CO2on Mars or methane on Titan). We now proceed to make this quantitative. The simplest case to consider is that of a single component atmosphere, which can attain cold enough temperatures to reach saturation and condense. This case is relevant to present Mars, which has an almost pure CO2atmosphere that can condense in the cold Winter hemisphere and at upper levels at any time of year. A pure CO2atmosphere with a surface pressure on the order of two or three bars is a commonly used model of the atmosphere of Early Mars, though the true atmospheric composition in that instance is largely a matter of speculation. Another important application of a single component condensible atmosphere is the pure steam (water vapor) atmosphere, which occurs when a planet with an ocean gets warm enough that the mass of water which evaporates into the atmosphere dominates the other gases that may be present. This case ﬁgures prominenently in the runaway greenhouse eﬀect that will be studied in Chapter **. For a single component atmosphere, the partial pressure of the condensible substance is in fact the total atmospheric pressure. Therefore, at saturation, the pressure is related to the temperature by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. To ﬁnd the saturated moist adiabat, we simply2.6.

we simply2.6. THE MOIST ADIABAT 23 solve for Tin terms of psatin the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, and recall that p=psatbecause we are assuming the atmosphere to be saturated – that is, any reduction in temperature or increase in pressure leads to condensation. Using the simpliﬁed form of Clausius-Clapeyron given in Eqn 2.20, the saturated moist adiabat would be T(p) =To 1−RTo Llnp psat(To)(2.21) where Ris the gas constant for the substance making up the atmosphere. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that Tois taken to be the surface temperature, so that psat(To) is the surface pressure ps. Since the logarithm is negative, the temperature decreases with altitude (recalling that lower pressure corresponds to higher altitude). Further, the factor multiplying the logarithm is the ratio of the surface temperature to the characteristic temperature L/R. Since the characteristic temperature is large, the prefactor is small, and as a result the temperature of saturated adiabat for a one-component atmosphere varies very little over a great range of pressures. For example, in the case of the CO2vapor-ice transition, and assuming a surface pressure of 6.89 mb (slightly larger than the present Martian value), the temperature only drops to 135K at a pressure of .00689mb (one one-hundredth of the surface pressure). Exercise 2.6.1 In the above example, what would the temperature aloft have been if there were no condensation and the parcel were lifted along the dry adiabat? Unless there is a reservoir of condensate at the surface to maintain saturation, it would be rare for an atmosphere to be saturated all the way to the ground. Suppose now that a one- component atmosphere has warm enough surface temperature that the surface pressure is lower than the saturation vapor pressure computed at the surface temperature.

surface temperature. In this case, when a parcel is lifted by convection, it’s temperature will follow the dryornoncondensing adiabat, until the temperature falls so much that the gas becomes saturated. The level at which this occurs is called the lifted condensation level . Above the lifted condensation level, ascent causes condensation and the parcel follows the saturated adiabat. Since the temperature curve along the saturated adiabat falls with altitude so much less steeply than the dry adiabat, it is very easy for the two curves to intersect provided the surface temperature is not exceedingly large. An example for present Martian conditions is shown in Figure 2.6. A comparison with the Martian proﬁles in Figure 2.3 indicates that something interesting is going on in the Martian atmosphere, which is not captured by the adiabat. Although results like Figure 2.6 show a region of weak temperature dependence aloft which bears a superﬁcial resemblance to the stratosphere seen in Earth soundings (and also at the top of the Venus, Jupiter and Titan soundings), one should not jump to the conclusion that the stratosphere is caused by condensation. This is not generally the case, and there are other reasons for the upper atmospheric temperature structure, which will be taken up in the next few chapters. As a ﬁnal step up on the ladder of generality, let’s consider a mixture of a condensible substance with a substance that doesn’t condense under the range of temperatures encountered in the atmosphere under consideration. This might be a mixture of condensible methane on Titan with non-condensible nitrogen, or condensible carbon dioxide on Early Mars with non- condensible nitrogen, or water vapor on Earth with a non-condensible mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. Whatever the substance, we distinguish the properties of the condensible substance with the subscript ”c,” and those of the non-condensible substance by the subscript ”a” (for ”air”).

(for ”air”). We now need to do the energy budget for a parcel of the mixture, assuming that it has been cooled down enough for the condensible substance to reach saturation, so that any further cooling24 CHAPTER 2. THERMODYNAMICS IN A NUTSHELL 120140160180200220240101001000Tp (Pa)Condensation level Figure 2.6: The adiabatic proﬁle for a pure CO2atmosphere with a surface pressure of 700 Pa (7mb) and a surface temperature of 220K. The conditions are similar to those encountered on present-day Mars. results in formation of enough condensate (with concomitant release of latent heat) to keep the system from becoming supersaturated. We further introduce the assumption that essentially all of the condensate is immediately removed from the system, so that the heat storage in whatever mass of condensate is left in suspension may be neglected. This is a reasonable approximation for water or ice clouds on Earth, but even in that case the slight eﬀect of the mass of retained condensate on buoyancy can be signiﬁcan in some circumstances. In other planetary atmospheres the eﬀect of retained condensate could be of greater importance. The temperature proﬁle obtained by assuming condensate is removed from the system is called a pseudoadiabat , because the process is not truly reversible. One cannot return to the original saturated state, because the condensate is lost. At the opposite extreme, if all condensate is retained, it can be re-evaporated when the parcel is compressed, allowing for true reversibility. Let the partial pressure, density, molecular weight, gas constant and speciﬁc heat of the noncondensible substance be pa,ρa,Ma,Ra, and cpa, and similarly for the condensible substance. Further, let Lbe the latent heat of the phase transition between the vapor and condensed phase of the condensible substance, and let pc,sat(T) be the saturation vapor pressure of this substance, as determined by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation.

Clausius-Clapeyron relation. The assumption of saturation amounts to saying that pc=pc,sat(T); if the parcel weren’t at saturation, there would be no condensation and we could simply use the dry adiabat based on a noncondensing mixture of substance ”a” and ”c.” Now consider a parcel consisting of a mass maof noncondensible gas with an initial mass mcof condensible gas. If the temperature is changed by an amount dTand the partial pressure of noncondensible gas is changed by an amount dpathen the total heat budget of the parcel is (ma+mc)δQ=macpadT−ma ρadpa+mccpcdT−mc ρcdpc+Ldm c (2.22) where dmcis the amount of mass lost to condensation. There is no term in this budget corre- sponding to heat storage in the condensed phase, since it is assumed that all condensate disappears from the parcel by precipitation. Technically, the temperature proﬁle we will compute as a result is the pseudoadiabat , rather than the adiabat , since the removal of condensate makes the process irreversible. The usual way to change dpawould be by lifting, causing expansion and reduction of pressure. Now, we divide by mcT, make use of the perfect gas law to substitute for ρaandρc, and2.6. THE MOIST ADIABAT 25 make use of the fact that mc/ma= (Mc/Ma)(pc/pa), since mc/mais just the mass mixing ratio, denoted henceforth by qc. This yields (1 +qc)δQ T=cpadT T−Radpa pa+cpcqcdT T−qcRcdpc pc+L Tdqc (2.23) The ﬁrst two terms can be recognized as the contribution of the two substances to the dry entropy of the mixture, weighted according to relative abundance of each species.

each species. If there is no condensation, the mixing ratio is conserved as the parcel is displaced to a new pressure, dqc= 0, and the expression reduces to the equivalent of Eqn. 2.6, leading to the dry adiabat for a mixture. At this point, we introduce the saturation assumption, which actually consists of two parts: First, we assume that the air parcel is initially saturated, so that before being displaced, pc=pc,sat(T) andqc=qsat=/epsilon1pc,sat(T)/pa, where /epsilon1is the ratio of molecular weights Mc/Maandpc,sat(T) is determined by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. Second, we assume that a displacement conserving qcwould cause supersaturation, so that condensation would occur and bring the partial pressure pcback to the saturation vapor pressure corresponding to the new value of T. Usually, this would occur as a result of ascent and cooling, since cooling strongly decreases the saturation vapor pressure. In rare circumstances, it can be compression that leads to condensation. More typically, though, the eﬀect of compressional warming on saturation vapor pressure dominates the eﬀect of increasing partial pressure, so that subsidence of initially saturated air follows the dry adiabat. Assuming that the displacement causes condensation, we may replace pcbypc,sat(T) and qcbyqsateverywhere in Eqn. 2.23. Next, we use Clausius-Clapeyron to re-write dpc,sat, observing that dpc,sat pc,sat=dlnpc,sat=dlnpc,sat dTdT (2.24) and dqsat=/epsilon1dpc,sat pa=/epsilon1pc padlnpc pa=qsat·(dlnpc,sat−dlnpa) (2.25) Upon substituting into Equation 2.23 and collecting terms in dlnTanddlnpawe ﬁnd (1 +qsat)δQ T= (cpa+ (cpc+ (L RcT−1)L T)qsat)dlnT−(1 +L RaTqsat)Radlnpa (2.26) To obtain the adiabat, we set δQ= 0, which leads to the following diferential equation deﬁning lnTas a function of ln pa: dlnT dlnpa=Ra cpa1 +L RaTqsat 1 + (cpc cpa+ (L RcT−1)L cpaT)qsat(2.27) Note that this expression reduces to the dry adiabat, as it should, when qsat→0.

when qsat→0. Exercise 2.6.2 What would the dry adiabat be for a noncondensing mixture of the two gases? Why doesn’t the expression reduce to the dry adiabat for the mixture as L→0? (Hint: Think about the way Clausius-Clapeyron has been used in deriving the moist adiabat). An examination of the typical properties of gases indicates that the cpc/cpais typically of order unity, whereas L/(RcT) is typically very large, so long as the temperature is not exceedingly great. If one drops the smaller terms from the denominator of Eqn 2.27, one ﬁnds that the temperature gradient along the moist adiabiabat is weaker than that along the dry adiabat provided /epsilon1L cpaT>1, which is typically the case. It is expected that condensation should weaken the gradient,26 CHAPTER 2. THERMODYNAMICS IN A NUTSHELL since it adds heat to the system and warms the air to greater temperatures than it would have had without condensation. This property can fail when the latent heat is weak or the noncondensible speciﬁc heat is very large, whereon the heat added by condensation has little eﬀect on temperature. It is in this regime that there is also the possibility that condensation happens on descent rather than ascent; it is a very uncommon regime. Everything on the right hand side of Eqn 2.27 is either a thermodynamic constant, or can be computed in terms of ln Tand ln pa. Therefore, the equation deﬁnes a ﬁrst order ordinary diﬀerential equation which can be integrated (usually numerically) to obtain Tas a function of pa. Usually one wants the temperature as a function of total pressure, rather than partial pressure of the noncondensible substance.

noncondensible substance. This is no problem. Once T(pa) is known, the corresponding total pressure at the same point is obtained by computing p=pa+pc,sat(T(pa)). To make a plot, or a table, one treats the problem parametrically: computing both Tandpas functions of pa. When the condensible substance is dilute, then pc,sat<< p a, and p≈pa, so Eqn 2.27 gives the desired result directly. Figure 2.7 shows a family of solutions to Eqn 2.27, for the case of water vapor in Earth air. When the surface temperature is 250K, there is so little moisture in the atmosphere that the proﬁle looks like the dry adiabat right to the ground. As temperature is increased, a region of weak gradients appears near the ground, representing the eﬀect of latent heat on temperature. This layer gets progressively deeper as temperature increases and the moisture content of the atmosphere increases. When the surface temperature is 350K, so much moisture has entered the atmosphere that the surface pressure has actually increased to over 1300mb. Moreover, the moisture-dominated region extends all the way to 10 Pa (.1mb) , and even at 100 Pa (1mb) the atmosphere is 10% water by volume. Thus, for moderate surface temperatures, there is little water high up in the atmosphere. When the surface temperature approaches or exceeds 350K, though, the ”cold trap” is lost, and a great deal of water is found aloft, where it is exposed to the destructive ultraviolet light of the sun and the possibility of thermal escape to space. In subsequent chapters, it will be seen that this phenomenon plays a major role in the life cycle of planets, and probably accounts for the present hot, dry state of Venus. 2.7 Rayleigh Fractionation Section under development. I am considering providing an introduction to Rayleigh distillation processes in this section, since it is a natural extension of moist thermodynamics and is crucial to the understanding of many paleoclimate proxies.

THERMODYNAMICS IN A NUTSHELLChapter 3 Elementary models of radiation balance 3.1 Energy balance and temperature Our objective is to understand the factors governing the climate of a planet. Certainly, there is more to climate than temperature, but equally certainly temperature is a major part of what is meant by ”climate,” and greatly aﬀects most of the other processes which come under that heading. From the preceding chapter, we know that the temperature of a chunk of matter provides a measure of its energy content. Suppose that the planet receives energy at a certain rate. If uncompensated by loss, energy will accumulate and the temperature of some part of the planet will increase without bound. Now suppose that the planet loses energy at a rate that increases with temperature. Then, the temperature will increase until the rate of energy loss equals the rate of gain.

of gain. It is this principle of energy balance that determines a planet’s temperature. To quantify the functional dependence of the two rates, one must know the nature of both energy loss and energy gain. The most familiar source of energy warming a planet is the absorption of light from the planet’s star. This is the dominant mechanism for rocky planets like Venus, Earth and Mars. It is also possible for energy to be supplied to the surface by heat transport from the deep interior, fed by radioactive decay, tidal dissipation, or high temperature material left over from the formation of the planet. Heat ﬂux from the interior is a major player in the climates of some gas giant planets, notably Jupiter and Saturn, because ﬂuid motions can easily transport heat from the deep interior to the outer envelope of the planet. The sluggish motion of molten rock, and even more sluggish diﬀusion of heat through solid rock, prevent internal heating from being a signiﬁcant part of the energy balance of rocky planets. Early in the history of a planet, when collisions are more common, the kinetic energy brought to the planet in the course of impacts with asteroids and planetesimals can be a signiﬁcant part of the planet’s energy budget. There are many ways a planet can gain energy, but essentially only one way a planet can lose energy. Since a planet sits in the hard vaccuum of outer space,and its atmosphere is rather tightly bound by gravity, not much energy can be lost through heated matter streaming away from the planet. The only signiﬁcant energy loss occurs through emission of electromagnetic radiation, most typically in the infrared spectrum. The quantiﬁcation of this rate, and the way it is aﬀected 2930 CHAPTER 3. ELEMENTARY MODELS OF RADIATION BALANCE by a planet’s atmosphere, leads us to the subject of blackbody radiation .

radiation . 3.2 Blackbody radiation It is a matter of familiar experience that a suﬃciently hot body emits light – hence terms like ”red hot” or ”white hot.” Once it is recognized that light is just one form of electromagnetic radiation, it becomes a natural inference that a body with any temperature at all should emit some form of electromagnetic radiation, though not necessarily visible light. Thermodynamics provides the proper tool for addressing this question. Imagine a gas consisting of two kinds of molecules, labeled Aand B. Suppose that the two species interact strongly with each other, so that they come into thermodynamic equilibrium and their statistical properties are characterized by the same temperature T. Now suppose that the molecules Aare ordinary matter, but that the ”molecules” Bare particles of electromagnetic radiation (”photons”) or, equivalently, electromagnetic waves. If they interact strongly with the Amolecules, whose energy distribution is characterized by their temperature Tin accord with classical thermodynamics, the energy distribution of the electromagnetic radiation should also be characterized by the same temperature T. In particular, for any Tthere should be a unique distribution of energy amongst the various frequencies of the waves. This spectrum can be observed by examining the electromagnetic radiation leaving a body whose temperature is uniform. The radiation in question is known as blackbody radiation because of the assumption that radiation interacts strongly with the matter; any radiation impinging on the body will not travel far before it is absorbed, and in this sense the body is called ”black” even though, like the Sun, it may be emitting light. Nineteenth century physicists found it natural to seek a theoretical explanation of the observed properties of blackbody radiation by applying well-established thermodynamical principles to electromagnetic radiation as described by Maxwell’s classical equations. The attempt to solve this seemingly innocuous problem led to the discovery of quantum theory, and a revolution in the fundamental conception of reality. Radiation is characterized by direction of propagation and frequency (and also polarization, which will not concern us).

concern us). For electromagnetic radiation, the frequency νand wavelength λare related by the dispersion relation νλ=c, where cis a constant with the dimensions of veloc- ity. Because visible light is a familiar form of electromagnetic radiation, cis usually called ”the speed of light.” The wavenumber, deﬁned by n=λ−1=ν/cis often used in preference to fre- quency or wavelength. Figure 3.1 gives the approximate regions of the electromagnetic spectrum corresponding to common names such as ”Radio Waves” and so forth. If a ﬁeld of radiation consists of a mixture of diﬀerent frequencies and directions, the mixture is characterized by a spectrum , which is a function describing the proportions of each type of radiation making up the blend. A spectrum is a density describing the amount of electromagnetic energy contained in a unit volume of the space (3D position, frequency, direction) needed to characterize the radiation. Suppose we wish to characterize the energy in the vicinity of a point /vector r in three dimensional space, with frequency near νand direction near that given by a unit vector ˆ n. Then if Σ( /vector r, ν,ˆn) is the energy spectrum at this point, the energy contained in a ﬁnite but small sized neighborhood of the point ( /vector r, ν,ˆn) is Σ dV dνd Ω, where dVis a small volume of space, dνis the width of the frequency band we wish to consider, and dΩ is a measure of the range of directions we wish to consider. A collection of directions in three-dimensional space is called a solid angle , and is measured in steradians .

Since electromagnetic waves in a vacuum move with constant speed c, the energy ﬂuxthrough a ﬂat patch perpendicular to ˆ nwith area dAis simply cΣdAdνd Ω, which deﬁnes the ﬂux spectrum cΣ. In mks units, the ﬂux spectrum has units of ( Watts/m2)/(Hz·steradian ), where the Hertz (Hz) is the unit of frequency, equal to one cycle per second. Exercise 3.2.1 The mks unit of energy is the Joule ,J, which is 1 Newton ·meter/sec . A Watt ( W) is1J/sec . A typical resting human in not-too-cold weather requires about 2000Calories/day . (A Calorie is the amount of energy needed to increase the temperature of 1Kgof pure water by 1K.) Convert this to a power consumption in W, using the fact that 1Calorie = 4184 J. On the average, the ﬂux of Solar energy reaching the Earth’s surface is about 240W/m2. Assuming that food plants can convert Solar energy to usable food calories with an eﬃciency of 1%, what is the maximum population the Earth could support? (The radius of the Earth is about 6371km) The bold assumption introduced by Planck is that electromagnetic energy is exchanged only in amounts that are multiples of discrete quanta , whose size depends on the frequency of the radiation, in much the same sense that a penny is the quantum of US currency.

US currency. Speciﬁcally, the quantum of energy for electromagnetic radiation having frequency νis ∆E=hν, where h is now known as Planck’s constant . It is (so far as currently known) a constant of the universe, which determines the granuarity of reality. his an exceedingly small number (6 .626·10−34Joule− seconds ), so quantization of energy is not directly manifest as discreteness in the energy changes of everyday objects. A 1 watt blue nightlight (wavelength .48 microns, or frequency 6 .24·1014Hzemits 2.4·1018photons each second, so it is no surprise that the light appears to be a continuous stream. If a bicycle were hooked to an electrical brake that dissipated energy by driving a blue light, emitting photons, the bike would indeed slow down in discontinuous increments, but the velocity increment, assuming the bike and rider to have a mass of 80 kg, would be only 10−10m/s; if one divides a 1m/s decrease of speed into 1010equal parts, the deceleration will appear entirely continuous to the rider. Nonetheless, the aggregate eﬀect of microscopic graininess of energy transitions exert a profound inﬂuence on the macroscopic properties of everyday objects. Blackbody radiation is a prime example of this. Once the quantum assumption was introduced, Planck was able to compute the ﬂux spec- trum of blackbody radiation with temperature Tusing standard thermodynamic methods. The answer is B(ν, T) =2hν3 c21 ehν/kT−1(3.1) where kis the Boltzmann thermodynamic constant deﬁned in Chapter 2. B(ν, T) is known as the Planck function . Note that the Planck function is independent of the direction of the radiation; this is because blackbody radiation is isotropic , i.e.

, i.e. equally intense in all directions. In a typical application of the Planck function, we wish to know the ﬂux of energy exiting the surface of a blackbody through a small nearly ﬂat patch with area dA, over a frequency band of width dν. Since energy exits through this patch at all angles, we must integrate over all directions. However, energy exiting in a direction which makes an angle θto the normal to the patch contributes a ﬂux (BdAdνd Ω) cos θthrough the patch, since the component of ﬂux parallel to the patch carries no energy through it. Further, using the deﬁnition of a steradian, dΩ = 2 πsinθdθfor the set of all rays making angles between θandθ+dθwith the normal to the patch. Integrating from θ= 0 to3.2. BLACKBODY RADIATION 33 θ=π/2, and using the fact that Bis independent of direction, we then ﬁnd that the ﬂux through the patch is πBdAdν . This is also the amount of electromagnetic energy in a frequency band of width dνthat would pass each second through a hoop enclosing area dA(from one chosen side to the other), placed in the interior of an ideal blackbody; an equal amount passes through the hoop in the opposite sense. The way the angular distribution of the radiation is described by the Planck function is rather confusing, and requires a certain amount of practice to get used to. The following exercise will test the readers’ comprehension of this matter. Exercise 3.2.2 A radiation detector ﬂies on an airplane a distance Habove an inﬁnite ﬂat plain with uniform temperature T. The detector is connected to a watt-meter which reports the total radiant power captured by the detector.

the detector. The detector is sensitive to rays coming in at angles ≤δθ relative to the direction in which the detector is pointed. The area of the aperture of the detector isδA. The detector is sensitive to frequencies within a small range δνcentered on ν0. If the detector is pointed straight down, what is the power received by the detector? What is the size of the ”footprint” on the plain to which the detector is sensitive? How much power is emitted by this footprint in the detector’s frequency band? Why is this power diﬀerent from the power received by the detector? How do your answers change if the detector is pointed at an angle of 45orelative to the vertical, rather than straight down? The Planck function depends on frequency only through the dimensionless variable u= hν/(kT). Recalling that each degree of freedom has energy1 2kTin the average, we see that uis half the ratio of the quantum of energy at frequency νto the typical energy in a degree of freedom of the matter with which the electromagnetic energy is in equilibrium. When uis large, the typical energy in a degree of freedom cannot create even a single photon of frequency ν, and such photons can be emitted only by those rare molecules with energy far above the mean. This is the essence of the way quantization aﬀects the blackbody distribution – through inhibition of emission of high-frequency photons. On the other hand, when uis small, the typical energy in a degree of freedom can make many photons of frequency ν, and quantization imposes less of a constraint on emission. The characteristic frequency kT/h deﬁnes the crossover between the classical world and the quantum world. Much lower frequencies are little aﬀected by quantization, whereas much higher frequencies are strongly aﬀected. At 300K, the crossover frequency is 6240 GigaHz , corresponding to a wavenumber of 20814 m−1, or a wavelength of 48 microns ; this is in the far infrared range.

infrared range. In terms of u, the Planck function can be rewritten B(ν, T) =2k3T3 h2c2u3 eu−1(3.2) In the classical limit, u/lessmuch1, and u3/(exp( u)−1)≈u2. Hence, B≈2kTν2/c2, which is independent ofh. In a classical world, where h= 0, this form of the spectrum would be valid for all frequencies, and the emission would increase quadratically with frequency without bound; a body with any nonzero temperature would emit infrared at a greater rate than microwaves, visible light at a greater rate than infrared, ultraviolet at a greater rate than visible, X-rays at a greater rate than ultraviolet, and so forth. Bodies in equilibrium would cool to absolute zero almost instantaneously through emission of a burst of gamma rays, cosmic rays and even higher frequency radiation. This is clearly at odds with observations, not least the existence of the Universe. We are saved from this catastrophe by the fact that his nonzero, which limits the range of validity of the classical34 CHAPTER 3. ELEMENTARY MODELS OF RADIATION BALANCE form of B. At frequencies high enough to make u/greatermuch1, then u3/(exp( u)−1)≈u3exp(−u) and the spectrum decays somewhat more slowly than exponentially as frequency is increased. The peak of Boccurs at u≈2.821, implying that the frequency of maximum emission is ν≈(2.821k/h)T≈ 58.78·109T. The peak of the frequency spectrum increases linearly with temperature. This behavior, ﬁrst deduced empirically long before it was explained by quantum theory, is known as theWien Displacement Law . Because the emission decays only quadratically on the low frequency side of the peak, but decays exponentially on the high frequency side, bodies emit appreciable energy at frequencies much lower than the peak emission, but very little at frequencies much higher.

much higher. For example, at one tenth the peak frequency, a body emits at a rate of 4.8% of the maximum value. However, at ten times the peak frequency, the body emits at a rate of only 8 .9·10−9of the peak emission. The microwave emission from a portion of the Earth’s atmosphere with temperature 250 K(having peak emission in the infrared) is readily detectable by satellites, whereas the emission of visible light is not. Since Bis a density, one cannot obtain the corresponding distribution in wavenumber or wavelength space by simply substituting for νin terms of wavenumber or wavelength in the formula forB. One must also take into account the transformation of dν. For example, to get the ﬂux density in wavenumber space (call it Bn) we use B(ν, T)dν=B(n·c, T)d(n·c) =cB(n·c, T)dn, whence Bn(n, T) =cB(n·c, T). Thus, transforming to wavenumber space changes the amplitude but not the shape of the ﬂux spectrum. The Planck density in wavenumber space is shown for various temperatures in Figure 3.2. Because the transformation of the density from frequency to wavenumber space only changes the labeling of the vertical axis of the graph, one can obtain the wavenumber of maximum emission in terms of the frequency of maximum emission using nmax=νmax/c. If one transforms to wavelength space, however, B(ν, T)dν=B(c/λ, T )d(c/λ) =−c λ2B(c/λ, T )dλ=2k5T5 h4c3u5 eu−1dλ=Bλdλ (3.3) where u=kT/(hν) =kTλ/ (hc), as before.

as before. Transforming to wavelength space changes the shape of the ﬂux spectrum. Bλhas its maximum at u≈4.965, which is nearly twice as large as the value for the wavenumber or frequency spectrum. Since the location of the peak of the ﬂux spectrum depends on the coordinate used to measure position within the electromagnetic spectrum, this quantity has no intrinsic physical meaning, apart from being a way to characterize the shape of the curve coming out of some particular kind of measuring apparatus. A more meaningful quantity can be derived from the cumulative ﬂux spectrum , value at a given point in the spectrum is the same regardless of whether we use wavenumber, wavelength, log λor any other coordinate to describe the position within the spectrum. The cumulative ﬂux spectrum is deﬁned as Fcum(ν, T) =/integraldisplayν 0πB(ν/prime, T)dν/prime=/integraldisplayλ ∞πBλ(λ/prime, T)dλ/prime(3.4) Note that in deﬁning the cumulative emission we have included the factor πwhich results from integrating over all angles of emission in a hemisphere. Fcum(ν, T) thus gives the power emitted per square meter for all frequencies less than ν, or equivalently, for all wavelengths greater than c/ν. This function is shown for various temperatures in the lower panel of Fig. 3.2, where it is plotted as a function of wavenumber. The value of νfor which Fcum(ν, T)reaches half the net emission Fcum(∞, T) provides a natural characterization of the spectrum. We will refer to this characteristic3.2.

ELEMENTARY MODELS OF RADIATION BALANCE frequency as the median emission frequency . The median emission wavelength and wavenumber is deﬁned analogously. Whether one uses frequency, wavelength or some other measure, the median emission is attained at u≈3.503. For any given coordinate used to describe the spectrum, the (angle-integrated) Planck density in that coordinate is the derivative of the cumulative emission with respect to the coordinate. Hence the peak in the Planck density just gives the point at which the cumulative emission function has its maximum slope. This depends on the coordinate used, unlike the point of median emission. Figure 3.1 shows the the portion of the spectrum in which blackbodies with various temperatures dominantly radiate. For example, a body with a temperature of around 4 Kradiates in the microwave region; this is the famous ”Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation” left over from the Big Bang1. A body with a temperature of 300 Kradiates in the infrared, one with a temperature of a few thousand degrees radiates in the visible, and one with a temperature of some tens of thousands of degrees would radiate in the ultraviolet. Next, we evaluate Fcum(∞, T), to obtain the total power Fexiting from each unit area of the surface of a blackbody: F=/integraldisplay∞ 0πB(ν, T)dν=/integraldisplay∞ 0πB(u, T)kT hdu= [2πk4 h3c2/integraldisplay∞ 0u3 eu−1du]T4=σT4(3.5) where2σ= 2π5k4/(15c2h3)≈5.67·10−8Wm−2K−4.

where2σ= 2π5k4/(15c2h3)≈5.67·10−8Wm−2K−4. The constant σis known as the Stefan- Boltzmann constant , and the law F=σT4is the Stefan-Boltzmann law . This law was originally deduce from observations, and Boltzmann was able to derive the fourth-power scaling in temper- ature using classical thermodynamic reasoning. However, classical physics yields an inﬁnite value for the constant σ. The formula for σclearly reveals the importance of quantum eﬀects in deter- mining this constant, since σdiverges like 1 /h3if we try to pass to the classical limit by making happroach zero. An important property of an ideal blackbody is that the radiation leaving its surface depends only on the temperature of the body. If a blackbody is interposed between an observer and some other object, all properties of the object will be hidden from the observer, who will see only blackbody radiation corresponding to the temperature of the blackbody. This remark allows us to make use of blackbody theory to determine the emission from objects whose temperature varies greatly from place to place, even though blackbody theory applies, strictly speaking, only to extensive bodies with uniform temperature. For example, the temperature of the core of the Earth is about 6000 K, but we need not know this in order to determine the radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface; the outermost few millimeters of rock, ice or water at the Earth’s surface contain enough matter to act like a blackbody to a very good approximation. Hence, the radiation emitted from the surface depends only on the temperature of this outer skin of the planet. Similarly, the temperature of the core of the Sun is about 16 ,000,000Kand even at a distance from the center equal to 90% of the visible radius, the temperature is above 600 ,000K. However, the Sun is encased in a layer a few hundred kilometers thick which is suﬃciently dense to act like a blackbody, and which has a temperature of about 5780 K. This layer is known as the photosphere , because it is the source of most light exiting the Sun.

the Sun. Layers farther out from the center of the Sun can be considerably hotter than the photosphere, but they have a minimal eﬀect on solar radiation because they are so tenuous. In Chapter 4 we will develop more precise methods for dealing with tenuous objects, such as atmospheres, which peter out gradually without having a sharply deﬁned boundary. 1What is remarkable about this observed cosmic radiation is not so much that it is in the microwave region, but that it has a blackbody spectrum, which says much about the interaction of radiation with matter in the early moments of the Universe. 2The deﬁnite integralR∞ 0(u3/(eu−1))duwas determined by Euler, as a special case of his study of the behavior of the Riemann zeta function at even integers. It is equal to 6 ζ(4) = π4/153.3. RADIATION BALANCE OF PLANETS 37 An ideal blackbody would be opaque at all wavelengths, but it is a common situation that a material acts as a blackbody only in a limited range of wavelengths. Consider the case of window glass: It is transparent to visible light, but if you could see it in the infrared it would look as opaque as stone. Because it interacts strongly with infrared light, window glass emits blackbody radiation in the infrared range. At temperatures below a few hundred K, there is little blackbody emission at wavelengths shorter than the infrared, so at such temperatures the net power per unit area emitted by a pane of glass with temperature Tis very nearly σT4, even though it doesn’t act like a blackbody in the visible range. Liquid water, and water ice, behave similarly. Crystalline table salt, and carbon dioxide ice, are nearly transparent in the infrared as well as in the visible, and in consequence emit radiation at a much lower rate than expected from the blackbody formula.

blackbody formula. (They would make ﬁne windows for creatures having infrared vision). There is, in fact, a deep and important relation between absorption and emission of radiation, which will be discussed in Section 3.5. 3.3 Radiation balance of planets As a ﬁrst step in our study of the temperature of planets, let’s consider the following idealized case: •The only source of energy heating the planet is absorption of light from the planet’s Sun. •The albedo , or proportion of sunlight reﬂected, is spatially uniform. •The planet is spherical, and has a distinct solid or liquid surface which radiates like a perfect blackbody. •The planet’s temperature is uniform over its entire surface. •The planet’s atmosphere is perfectly transparent to the electromagnetic energy emitted by the surface. The uniform-temperature assumption presumes that the planet has an atmosphere or ocean which is so well stirred that it is able to rapidly mix heat from one place to another, smoothing out the eﬀects of geographical ﬂuctuations in the energy balance. The Earth conforms fairly well to this approximation. The equatorial annual mean temperature is only 4% above the global mean temperature of 286 K, while the North polar temperature is only 10% below the mean. The most extreme deviation occurs on the high Antarctic plateau, where the annual mean South polar temperature is 21% below the global mean. The surface temperature of Venus is even more uniform than that of Earth. That of Mars, which in our era, has a thin atmosphere and no ocean, is less uniform. Airless, rocky bodies like the Moon and Mercury do not conform at all well to the uniform temperature approximation. Light leaving the upper layers of the Sun and similar stars takes the form of blackbody radiation. It is isotropic, and its ﬂux and ﬂux spectrum conform to the blackbody law corresponding to the temperature of the photosphere, from which the light escapes.

light escapes. Once the light leaves the surface of the star, however, it expands through space and does not interact signiﬁcantly with matter except where it is intercepted by a planet. Therefore, it is no longer blackbody radiation, though it retains the blackbody spectrum. In the typical case of interest, the planet orbits its star at a distance that is much greater than the radius of the star, and itself has a radius that is considerably smaller than the star and is hence yet smaller than the orbital distance. In this38 CHAPTER 3. ELEMENTARY MODELS OF RADIATION BALANCE circumstance, all the rays of light which intersect the planet are very nearly parallel to the line joining the center of the planet to the center of its star; the sunlight comes in as a nearly parallel beam , rather than being isotropic, as would be the case for true blackbody radiation. The parallel- beam approximation is equivalent to saying that, as seen from the planet, the Sun occupies only a small portion of the sky, and as seen from the Sun the planet also occupies only a small portion of the sky. Even for Mercury, with a mean orbital distance of 58 ,000,000km, the Sun (whose radius is 695 ,000km) occupies an angular width in the sky of only about 2 ·695,000/58,000,000 radians, or 1.4o. The solar ﬂux impinging on the planet is also reduced, as compared to the solar ﬂux leaving the photosphere of the star. The total energy per unit frequency leaving the star is 4πr2 ⊙(πB(ν, T⊙)), where r⊙is the radius of the star and T⊙is the temperature of its photo- sphere. At a distance rfrom the star, the energy has spread uniformly over a sphere whose surface area is 4 πr2; hence at this distance, the energy ﬂux per unit frequency is πBr2 ⊙/r2, and the total ﬂux is σT4 ⊙r2 ⊙/r2.

⊙r2 ⊙/r2. The latter is the ﬂux seen by a planet at orbital distance r, in the form of a beam of parallel rays. It is known as the solar ”constant” (even though it in fact depends on distance from the star), and will be denoted by L⊙, or simply Lwhere there is no risk of confusion with latent heat. We are now equipped to compute the energy balance of the planet, subject to the preceding simplifying assumptions. Let abe the planet’s radius. Since the cross-section area of the planet isπa2and the solar radiation arrives in the form of a nearly parallel beam with ﬂux L⊙, the energy per unit time impinging on the planet’s surface is πa2L⊙; the rate of energy absorption is (1−α)πa2L⊙, where αis the albedo. The planet loses energy by radiating from its entire surface, which has area 4 πa2. Hence the rate of energy loss is 4 πa2σT4, where Tis the temperature of the planet’s surface. In equilibrium the rate of energy loss and gain must be equal. After cancelling a few terms, this yields σT4=1 4(1−α)L⊙ (3.6) Note that this is independent of the radius of the planet. The factor1 4comes from the ratio of the planet’s cross-sectional area to its surface area, and reﬂects the fact that the planet intercepts only a disk of the incident solar beam, but radiates over its entire spherical surface. This equation can be readily solved for T. If we substitute for L⊙in terms of the photospheric temperature, the result is T=1√ 2(1−α)1/4/radicalbiggr⊙ rT⊙ (3.7) Formula 3.7 shows that the blackbody temperature of a planet is much less than that of the photosphere, so long as the orbital distance is large compared to the stellar radius.

stellar radius. From the displacement law, it follows that the planet loses energy through emission at a distinctly lower wavenumber than that at which it receives energy from its star. This situation is illustrated in Figure 3.3. For example, the energy received from our Sun has a median wavenumber of about 15000 cm−1, equivalent to a wavelength of about .7microns . An isothermal planet at Mercury’s orbit would radiate to space with a median emission wavenumber of 1100 cm−1, corresponding to a wavelength of 9 microns . An isothermal planet at the orbit of Mars would radiate with a median wavenumber of 550 cm−1, corresponding to a wavelength of 18 microns . Exercise 3.3.1 A planet with zero albedo is in orbit around an exotic hot star having a photo- spheric temperature of 100,000K. The ratio of the planet’s orbit to the radius of the star is the same as for Earth (about 215). What is the median emission wavnumber of the star? In what part of the electromagnetic spectrum does this lie? What is the temperature of the planet? In what3.3.

The Planck densities are transformed to a logarithmic spectral coordinate, and all are normalized to unit total emission. part of the electromagnetic spectrum does the planet radiate? Do the same if the planet is instead in orbit around a brown dwarf star with a photospheric temperature of 600K. The separation between absorption and emission wavenumber will prove very important when we bring a radiatively active atmosphere into the picture, since it allows the atmosphere to have a diﬀerent eﬀect on incoming vs. outgoing radiation.

outgoing radiation. Since the outgoing radiation has longer wavelength than the incoming radiation, the ﬂux of emitted outgoing radiation is often referred to as outgoing longwave radiation , and denoted by OLR . For a non-isothermal planet, the OLR is a function of position (e.g. latitude and longitude on an imaginary sphere tightly enclosing the planet and its atmosphere). We will also use the term to refer to the outgoing ﬂux averaged over the surface of the sphere, even when the planet is not isothermal. As for the other major term in the planet’s energy budget, we will refer to the electromagnetic energy received from the planet’s star as the shortwave orsolar energy. Our own Sun has its primary output in the visible part of the spectrum, but it also emits signiﬁcant amounts of energy in the ultraviolet and near-infrared, both of which are shorter in wavelength than the OLR by which planets lose energy to space. Formula 3.7 is plotted in Figure 3.4 for a hypothetical isothermal planet with zero albedo. Because of the square-root dependence on orbital distance, the temperature varies only weakly with distance, except very near the star. Neglecting albedo and atmospheric eﬀects, Earth would have a mean surface temperature of about 280 K. Venus would be only 50K warmer than the Earth and Mars only 53 Kcolder. At the distant orbit of Jupiter, the blackbody equilibrium temperature falls to 122 K, but even at the vastly more distant orbit of Neptune the temperature is still as high as 50 K. The emission from all of these planets lies in the infrared range, though the colder planets radiate in the deeper (lower wavenumber) infrared. An exception to the strong separation between stellar and planetary temperature is provided by the ”roasters” – a recently discovered40 CHAPTER 3.

Dots show the equilibrium blackbody temperature of the Solar System planets, based on their actual observed albedos. class of extrasolar giant planets withr r⊙as low as 5. Such planets can have equilibrium blackbody temperatures as much as a third that of the photosphere of the parent star. For these planets, the distinction between the behavior of incoming and outgoing radiation is less sharp. It is instructive to compare the ideal blackbody temperature with observed surface temper- ature for the three Solar System bodies which have both a distinct surface and a thick enough atmosphere to enforce a roughly uniform surface temperature: Venus, Earth and Saturn’s moon Titan. For this comparison, we calculate the blackbody temperature using the observed planetary albedos, instead of assuming a hypothetical zero albedo planet as in Fig. 3.4. Venus is covered by thick, highly reﬂective clouds, which raise its albedo to .65. The corresponding isothermal blackbody temperature is only 253 K(as compared to 330 Kin the zero albedo case). This is far less than the observed surface temperature of 740 K. Clearly, the atmosphere of Venus exerts a profound warming eﬀect on the surface. The warming arises from the inﬂuence of the atmosphere on the infrared emission of the planet, which we have not yet taken into account. Earth’s albedo is on the order of .3, leading to a blackbody temperature of 255 K. The observed mean surface temperature is 286K. Earth’s atmosphere has a considerably weaker warming eﬀect than that of Venus, but it is nonetheless a very important warming, since it brings the planet from subfreez- ing temperatures where the oceans would almost certainly become ice-covered, to temperatures where liquid water can exist over most of the planet. The albedo of Titan is .21, and using the solar constant at Saturn’s orbit we ﬁnd a black body temperature of 85 K. The observed surface temperature is about 95 K, whence we conclude that the infrared eﬀects of Titan’s atmosphere moderately warm the surface.

the surface. The way energy balance determines surface temperature is illustrated graphically in Figure 3.5. One ﬁrst determines the way in which the mean infrared emission per unit area depends on the mean surface temperature Ts; for the isothermal blackbody calculation, this curve is simply3.3. RADIATION BALANCE OF PLANETS 41 σT4 s. The equilibrium temperature is determined by the point at which the OLR curve intersects the curve giving the absorbed solar radiation (a horizontal line in the present calculation). In some sense, the whole subject of climate comes down to an ever-more sophisticated heirarchy of calculations of the curve OLR (Ts); our attention will soon turn to the task of determining how the OLR curve is aﬀected by an atmosphere. With increasing sophistication, we will also allow the solar absorption to vary with Ts, owing to changing clouds, ice cover, vegetation cover, and other characteristics. We will now consider an idealized thought experiment which illustrates the essence of the way an atmosphere aﬀects OLR . Suppose that the atmosphere has a temperature proﬁle T(p) which decreases with altitude,according to the dry or moist adiabat. Let psbe the surface pressure, and suppose that the ground is strongly thermally coupled to the atmosphere by turbulent heat exchanges, so that the ground temperature cannot deviate much from that of the immediately overlying air. Thus, Ts=T(ps). If the atmosphere were transparent to infrared, as is very nearly the case for nitrogen or oxygen, the OLR would be σT4 s. Now, let’s stir an additional gas into the portion of the atmosphere between the ground and a pressure prad< ps, and suppose that the gas is transparent to solar radiation, but interacts so strongly with infrared that it turns each portion of the atmosphere it is mixed with into a perfect blackbody. A gas which is fairly transparent to the incoming shortwave stellar radiation but which interacts strongly with the outgoing (generally infrared) emitted radiation is called a greenhouse gas .

gas . Carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane are some examples of greenhouse gases, and the molecular properties that make a substance a good greenhouse gas will be discussed in Chapter 4. If one imagines slicing the atmosphere into a number layers so thin that they are essentially isothermal, then each layer with pressure greater than or equal to pradradiates like an ideal blackbody at its own temperature, but it is only the topmost of these layers that determines the radiation loss to space, since radiation from all the others is absorbed before it reaches the topmost layer. Since the topmost layer has temperature T(prad) and higher altitude layers are assumed transparent to infrared, the OLR isσT(prad)4, which is less than σT4 sto the extent that prad< ps. As shown in Figure 3.5, a greenhouse gas acts like an insulating blanket, reducing the rate of energy loss to space at any given surface temperature. The equilibrium surface temperature of a planet with a greenhouse gas in its atmosphere must be greater than that of a planet without a greenhouse gas, in order to radiate away energy at a suﬃcient rate to balance the absorbed solar radiation. In the real universe, greenhouse gases are continuously distributed in the atmosphere, rather than being conﬁned to a single layer. Further, they increase the interaction of the atmosphere with infrared, but rarely so much so as to turn some upper portion of the atmosphere into an ideal blackbody. In reality,the infrared escaping to space is a blend of radiation emitted from a range of atmospheric levels, with some admixture of radiation from the planet’s surface as well. The concept of an eﬀective radiating level nonetheless has merit for real greenhouse gases. It does not represent a distinct physical layer of the atmosphere, but rather characterizes the mean depth from which infrared photons escape to space. As more greenhouse gas is added to an atmosphere, more of the lower parts of the atmosphere become opaque to infrared, preventing the escape of infrared radiation from those regions.

those regions. This increases the altitude of the eﬀective radiating level (i.e. decreases prad). From an observation of the actual OLR emitted by a planet, one can determine an equivalent blackbody radiating temperature Tradfrom the expression σT4 rad=OLR . This temperature is the infrared equivalent of the Sun’s photospheric temperature; it is a kind of mean temperature of the regions from which infrared photons escape, and pradrepresents a mean pressure of these layers. For planets for which absorbed solar radiation is the only signiﬁcant energy source, Tradis equal to the ideal blackbody temperature given by Eq. 3.7. The arduous task of relating the eﬀective radiating level to speciﬁed concentrations of real greenhouse gases will be taken up in Chapter 4.42 CHAPTER 3.

surface temperature. In equilibrium, the outgoing radiation must remain equal to the absorbed solar radiation, so Trad stays constant. However, as more greenhouse gas is added to the atmosphere, pradis reduced, so one must extrapolate temperature further along the adiabat to reach the surface. Figure 3.7 illustrates the reduction of infrared emission caused by the Earth’s atmosphere. At every latitude, the observed OLR is much less than it would be if the planet radiated to space at its observed surface temperature. At the Equator the observed OLR is 238 W/m2, corresponding to a radiating temperature of 255 W/m2. This is much less than the observed surface temperature of 298 K, which would radiate at a rate of 446 W/m2if the atmosphere didn’t intervene. It is interesting that the gap between observed OLR and the computed surface emission is less in the cold polar regions, and especially small at the Winter pole. This happens partly because, at low temperatures, there is simply less infrared emission for the atmosphere to trap. However, diﬀerences in the water content of the atmosphere, and diﬀerences in the temperature proﬁle, can also play a role. These eﬀects will be explored in Chapter 4. Gases are not the only atmospheric constituents which aﬀect OLR . Clouds consist of parti- cles of condensed substance small enough to stay suspended for a long time. They can profoundly inﬂuence OLR . Gram for gram, condensed water interacts much more strongly with infrared than does water vapor. In fact, a mere 20 grams of water in the form of liquid droplets of a typical size is suﬃcient to turn a column of air 500 mthick by one meter square into a very nearly ideal blackbody. To a much greater extent than for greenhouse gases, a water cloud layer in an other- wise infrared-transparent atmosphere really can be thought of as a discrete radiating layer.

radiating layer. The prevalance of clouds in the high, cold regions of the tropical atmosphere accounts for the dip in OLR near the equator, seen in Figure 3.7. Clouds are unlike greenhouse gases, though, since they also strongly reﬂect the incoming solar radiation. It’s the tendency of these two large eﬀects to partly cancel that makes the problem of the inﬂuence of clouds on climate so challenging. Not all condensed substances absorb infrared as well as water does. Liquid methane (imporant on Titan) and CO2 ice (important on present and early Mars) are comparatively poor infrared absorbers. They aﬀect OLR in a fundamentally diﬀerent way, through reﬂection instead of absorption and emission. This will be discussed in Chapter 5.44 CHAPTER 3.

The observations were taken by satellite instruments during the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), and are averaged along latitude circles. The ﬁgure also shows the radiation that would be emitted to space by the surface ( σT4 s) if the atmosphere were transparent to infrared radiation.3.3. RADIATION BALANCE OF PLANETS 45 In a nutshell, then, here is how the greenhouse eﬀect works: From the requirement of energy balance, the absorbed solar radiation determines the eﬀective blackbody radiating temperature Trad. This is not the surface temperature; it is instead the temperature encountered at some pressure level in the atmosphere prad, which characterizes the infrared opacity of the atmosphere, speciﬁcally the typical altitude from which infrared photons escape to space.

to space. The pressure pradis determined by the greenhouse gas concentration of the atmosphere. The surface temperature is determined by starting at the ﬁxed temperature Tradand extrapolating from pradto the surface pressure psusing the atmosphere’s lapse rate, which is approximately governed by the appropriate adiabat. Since temperature decreases with altitude over much of the depth of a typical atmosphere, the surface temperature so obtained is typically greater than Trad, as illustrated in Figure 3.6. Increasing the concentration of a greenhouse gas decreases prad, and therefore increases the surface temperature because temperature is extrapolated from Tradover a greater pressure range. It is very important to recognize that greenhouse warming relies on the decrease of atmospheric temperature with height, which is generally due to the adiabatic proﬁle established by convection. The greenhouse eﬀect works by allowing a planet to radiate at a temperature colder than the surface, but for this to be possible, there must be some cold air aloft for the greenhouse gas to work with. For an atmosphere whose temperature proﬁle is given by the dry adiabat, the surface tem- perature is Ts= (ps/prad)R/cpTrad. (3.8) With this formula, the Earth’s present surface temperature can be explained by taking prad/ps= .67, whence prad≈670mb. Earth’s actual radiating pressure is somewhat lower than this estimate, because the atmosperic temperature decays less strongly with height than the dry adiabat. The high surface temperature of Venus can be accounted for by taking prad/ps=.0095, assuming that the temperature proﬁle is given by the noncondensing adiabat for a pure CO2atmosphere. Given Venus’ 93 barsurface pressure, the radiating level is 880 mbwhich, interestingly, is only slightly less than Earth’s surface pressure.

surface pressure. Earth radiates to space from regions quite close to its surface, whereas Venus radiates only from a thin shell near the top of the atmosphere. Note that from the observed Venusian temperature proﬁle in Fig. 2.3, the radiating temperature (253 K) is encountered at p= 250 mbrather than the higher pressure we estimated. As for the Earth, our estimate of the precise value pradfor Venus is oﬀ because the ideal-gas noncondensing adiabat is not a precise model of the actual temperature proﬁle. In the case of Venus, the problem most likely comes from the ideal-gas assumption, rather than condensation. The concept of radiating level and radiating temperature also enables us to make sense of the way energy balance constrains the climates of gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, which have no distinct surface. The essence of the calculation we have already done for rocky planets is to use the top of atmosphere energy budget to determine the parameters of the adiabat, and then extrapolate temperature to the surface along the adiabat. For a non-condensing adiabat, the atmospheric proﬁle compatible with energy balance is T(p) =Trad(p/prad)R/cp. This remains the appropriate temperature proﬁle for a (noncondensing) convecting outer layer of a gas giant, and the only diﬀerence with the previous case is that, for a gas giant, there is no surface to act as a natural lower boundary for the adiabatic region. At some depth, convection will give out and the adiabat must be matched to some other temperature model in order to determine the base of the convecting region, and to determine the temperature of deeper regions. There is no longer any distinct surface to be warmed by the greenhouse eﬀect, but the greenhouse gas concentration of the atmosphere nonetheless aﬀects T(p) through prad.

through prad. For example, adding some additional greenhouse gas to the convecting outer region of Jupiter’s atmosphere would decrease prad, and therefore increase the temperature encountered at, say, the 1 bar pressure level.46 CHAPTER 3.

The solar-only value of Tradis the radiating temperature that would balance the observed absorbed solar energy, in the absence of any internal heat source. The energy balance suﬃces to uniquely determine the temperature proﬁle because the non- condensing adiabat is a one-parameter family of temperature proﬁles. The saturated adiabat for a mixture of condensing and noncondensing gases is also a one parameter family, deﬁned by Eq. 2.27, and can therefore be treated similarly. If the appropriate adiabat for the planet had more than one free parameter, additional information beyond the energy budget would be needed to close the problem. On the other hand, a single component condensing atmosphere such as described by Eq. 2.21 yields a temperature proﬁle with no free parameters that can be adjusted so as to satisfy the energy budget. The consequences of this quandary will be taken up as part of our discussion of the runaway greenhouse phenonenon, in Chapter 7. Using infrared telescopes on Earth and in space, one can directly measure the OLR of the planets in our Solar System. In the case of the gas giants, the radiated energy is substantially in excess of the absorbed solar radiation.

solar radiation. Table 3.1 compares the observed OLR to the absorbed solar ﬂux for the gas giants. With the exception of Uranus, the gas giants appear to have a substantial internal energy source, which raises the radiating temperature to values considerably in excess of it would be if the planet were heated by solar absorption alone. Uranus is anomalous, in that it actually appears to be emitting less energy than it receives from the sun. Uncertainties in the observed OLR for Uranus would actually allow the emission to be in balance with solar absorption, but would still appear to preclude any signiﬁcant internal energy source. This may indicate a profound diﬀerence in the internal dynamics of Uranus. On the other hand, the unusually large tilt of Uranus’ rotation axis means that Uranus has an unusually strong seasonal variation of solar heating, and it may be that the hemisphere that has been observed so far has not yet had time to come into equilibrium, which would throw oﬀ the energy balance estimate. Because it is the home planet, Earth’s radiation budget has been very closely monitored by satellites. Very precise measurements show that the top of atmosphere radiation budget is currently out of balance, the Earth receiving about 1 W/m2more from Solar absorption than it emits to space as infrared. This is opposite from the imbalance that would be caused by an internal heating. It is a direct consequence of the rapid rise of CO2and other greenhouse gases, caused by the bustling activities of Earth’s human inhabitants. The rapid greenhouse gas increase has cut down the OLR , but because of the time required to warm up the oceans and melt ice, the Earth’s temperature has not yet risen enough to restore the energy balance. Exercise 3.3.2 A typical well-fed human in a resting state consumes energy in the form of food at a rate of 100W, essentially all of which is put back into the surroundings in the form of heat.

of heat. An astronaut is in a spherical escape pod of radius r, far beyond the orbit of Pluto, so that it receives essentially no energy from sunlight. The air in the escape pod is isothermal. The skin of the escape pod is a good conductor of heat, so that the surface temperature of the sphere is identical to the interior temperature. The surface radiates like an ideal blackbody. Find an expression for the temperature in terms of r, and evaluate it for a few reasonable3.3. RADIATION BALANCE OF PLANETS 47 values. Is it better to have a bigger pod or a smaller pod? In designing such an escape pod, should you include an additional source of heat if you want to keep the astronaut comfortable? How would your answer change if the pod were cylindrical instead of spherical? If the pod were cubical? Bodies such as Mercury or the Moon represent the opposite extreme from the uniform- temperature limit. Having no atmosphere or ocean to transport heat, and a rocky surface through which heat is conducted exceedingly slowly, each bit of the planet is, to a good approximation, thermally isolated from the rest. Moreover, the rocky surface takes very little time to reach its equilibrium temperature, so the surface temperature at each point is very nearly in equilibrium with the instantaneous absorbed solar radiation, with very little day-night or seasonal averaging. In this case, averaging the energy budget over the planet’s surface gives a poor estimate of the temperature, and it would be more accurate to compute the instantaneous equilibrium temperature for each patch of the planet’s surface in isolation. For example, consider a point on the planet where the Sun is directly overhead at some particular instant of time. At that time, the rays of sunlight come in perpendicularly to a small patch of the ground, and the absorbed solar radiation per unit area is simply (1 −α)L⊙; the energy balance determing the ground temperature is then σT4= (1−α)L⊙, without the factor of1 4we had when the energy budget was averaged over the entire surface of an isothermal planet.

isothermal planet. For Mercury, this yields a temperature of 622 K, based on the mean orbital distance and an albedo of .1. This is similar to the observed maximum temperature on Mercury, which is about 700 K(somewhat larger than the theoretical calculation because Mercury’s highly elliptical orbit brings it considerably closer to the Sun than the mean orbital position). The Moon, which is essentially in the same orbit as Earth and shares its Solar constant, has a predicted maximum temperature of 384 K, which is very close to the observed maximum. In contrast, the maximum surface temperature on Earth stays well short of 384 K, even at the hottest time of day in the hottest places. The atmosphere of Mars in the present epoch is thin enough that this planet behaves more like the no-atmosphere limit than the uniform-temperature limit. Based on a mean albedo of .25,the local maximum temperature should be 297 K, which is quite close to the observed maximum temperature. More generally speaking, when doing energy balance calculations the temperature we have in mind is the temperature averaged over an appropriate portion of the planet and over an appropriate time interval, where what is ”appropriate” depends on the response time and the eﬃciency of the heat transporting mechanisms of the planet under considerations. Correspondingly, the appropriate incident solar ﬂux to use is the incident solar ﬂux per unit of radiating surface, averaged consistently with temperature. We will denote this mean solar ﬂux by the symbol S. For an isothermal planet S=1 4L⊙, while at the opposite extreme S=L⊙for the instantaneous response at the subsolar point. In other circumstances it might be appropriate to average along a latitude circle, or over a hemisphere. A more complete treatment of geographical, seasonal and diurnal temperature variations will be given in Chapter 8. Exercise 3.3.3 Consider a planet which is tide-locked to its Sun, so that it always shows the same face to the Sun as it proceeds in its orbit (just as the Moon always shows the same face to the Earth).

These are only representative values. Albedo can vary considerably as a function of detailed conditions. For example, the ocean albedo depends on the angle of the solar radiation striking the surface (the value given in the table is for near-normal incidence), and the albedo of bare sea ice depends on the density of air bubbles. 3.4 Ice-albedo feedback Albedo is not a static quantity determined once and for all time when a planet forms. In large measure, albedo is determined by processes in the atmosphere and at the surface which are highly sensitive to the state of the climate. Clouds consist of suspended tiny particles of the liquid or solid phase of some atmospheric constituent; such particles are very eﬀective reﬂectors of visible and ultraviolet light, almost regardless of what they are made of. Clouds almost entirely control the albedos of Venus, Titan and all the gas giant planets, and also play a major role in Earth’s albedo. In addition, the nature of a planet’s surface can evolve over time, and many of the surface characteristics are strongly aﬀected by the climate. Table 3.2 gives the albedo of some common surface types encountered on Earth.

on Earth. The proportions of the Earth covered by sea-ice, snow, glaciers, desert sands or vegetation of various types are determined by temperature and precipitation patterns. As climate changes, the surface characteristics change too, and the resulting albedo changes feed back on the state of the climate. It is not a ”chicken and egg” question of whether climate causes albedo or albedo causes climate; rather it is a matter of ﬁnding a consistent state compatible with the physics of the way climate aﬀects albedo and the way albedo aﬀects climate. In this sense, albedo changes lead to a form of climate feedback . We will encounter many other kinds of feedback loops in the climate system. Among all the albedo feedbacks, that associated with the cover of the surface by highly reﬂective snow or ice plays a distinguished role in thinking about the evolution of the Earth’s climate. Let’s consider how albedo might vary with temperature for a planet entirely covered by a water ocean – a reasonable approximation to Earth, which is2 3ocean. We will characterize the climate by the global mean surface temperature Ts, but suppose that, like Earth, the temperature is somewhat colder than Tsat the poles and somewhat warmer than Tsat the Equator. When Ts is very large, say greater than some threshold temperature To, the temperature is above freezing everywhere and there is no ice. In this temperature range, the planetary albedo reduces to the relatively low value (call it αo) characteristic of sea water. At the other extreme, when Tsis very, very low, the whole planet is below freezing, the ocean will become ice-covered everywhere, and the3.4. ICE-ALBEDO FEEDBACK 49 albedo reduces to that of sea ice, which we shall call αi. We suppose that this occurs for Ts< Ti, where Tiis the threshold temperature for a globally frozen ocean.

frozen ocean. In general Timust be rather lower than the freezing temperature of the ocean, since when the mean temperature Ts=Tfreeze the equatorial portions of the planet will still be above freezing. Between TiandToit is reasonable to interpolate the albedo by assuming the ice cover to decrease smoothly and monotonically from 100% to zero. The phenomena we will emphasize are not particularly sensitive to the detailed form of the interpolation, but the quadratic interpolation α(T) =  αi forT≤Ti, αo+ (αi−αo)(T−To)2 (Ti−To)2forTi< T < T o αo forT≥To(3.9) qualitatively reproduces the shape of the albedo curve which is found in detailed calculations. In particular, the slope of albedo vs temperature is large when the temperature is low and the planet is nearly ice-covered, because there is more area near the Equator, where ice melts ﬁrst. Conversely, the slope reduces to zero as the temperature threshold for an ice-free planet is approached, because there is little area near the poles where the last ice survives; moreover, the poles receive relatively little sunlight in the course of the year, so the albedo there contributes less to the global mean than does the albedo at lower latitudes. Note that this description assumes an Earthlike planet, which on average is warmest near the Equator. As will be discussed in Chapter 8, other orbital conﬁgurations could lead to the poles being warmer, and this would call for a diﬀerent shape of albedo curve. Ice albedo feedback of a similar sort could arise on a planet with land, through snow accu- mulation and glacier formation on the continents. The albedo could have a similar temperature dependence, in that glaciers are unlikely to survive where temperatures are very much above freez- ing, but can accumulate readily near places that are below freezing – provided there is enough precipitation .

precipitation . It is the latter requirement that makes land-based snow/ice albedo feedback much more complicated than the oceanic case. Precipitation is determined by complex atmospheric circulation patterns that are not solely determined by local temperature. A region with no precip- itation will not form glaciers no matter how cold it is made. The present state of Mars provides a good example: its small polar glaciers do not advance to the Equator, even though the daily aver- age equatorial temperature is well below freezing. Still, for a planet like Earth with a widespread ocean to act as a source for precipitation, it may be reasonable to assume that most continental areas will eventually become ice covered if they are located at suﬃciently cold latitudes. In fair- ness, we should point out that even the formation of sea ice is considerably more complex than we have made it out to be, particularly since it is aﬀected by the mixing of deep unfrozen water with surface waters which are trying to freeze. Earth is the only known planet that has an evident ice/snow albedo feedback, but it is reasonable to inquire as to whether a planet without Earth’s water-dominated climate could behave analogously. Snow is always ”white” more or less regardless of the substance it is made of, since its reﬂectivity is due to the refractive index discontinuity between snow crystals and the ambient gas or vacuum. Therefore, a snow-albedo feedback could operate with substances other than water (e.g. nitrogen or methane). Titan presents an exotic possibility, in that its surface is bathed in a rain of tarry hydrocarbon sludge, raising the speculative possibility of ”dark glacier” albedo feedbacks. Sea ice forming on Earth’s ocean gets its high albedo from trapped air bubbles, which act like snowﬂakes in reverse. The same could happen for ices of other substances, but sea-ice albedo feedback is likely to require a water ocean.

water ocean. The reason is that water, alone among likely planetary materials, ﬂoats when it freezes. Ice forming on, say, a carbon dioxide or methane ocean would sink as soon as it formed, preventing it from having much eﬀect on surface albedo.50 CHAPTER 3. ELEMENTARY MODELS OF RADIATION BALANCE Returning attention to an Earthlike waterworld, we write down the energy budget (1−α(Ts))L⊙ 4=OLR (Ts) (3.10) This determines Tsas before, with the important diﬀerence that the Solar absorption on the left hand side is now a function of Tsinstead of being a constant. Analogously to Fig. 3.5, the equilibrium surface temperature can be found by plotting the absorbed Solar radiation and the OLR vs.Tson the same graph. This is done in Fig. 3.8, for four diﬀerent choices of L⊙. In this plot, we have taken OLR =σT4, which assumes no greenhouse eﬀect3. In contrast with the ﬁxed- albedo case, the ice-albedo feedback allows the climate system to have multiple equilibria : there can be more than one climate compatible with a given Solar constant, and additional information is required to determine which state the planet actually settles into. The nature of the equilibria depends on L⊙. When L⊙is suﬃciently small (as in the case L⊙= 1516 W/m2in Fig. 3.8) there is only one solution, which is a very cold globally ice-covered Snowball state, marked Sn1on the graph. Note that the Solar constant that produces a unique Snowball state exceeds the present Solar constant at Earth’s orbit. Thus, were it not for the greenhouse eﬀect, Earth would be in such a state, and would have been for its entire history.

entire history. When Lodot is suﬃciently large (as in the case L⊙= 2865 W/m2in Fig. 3.8) there is again a unique solution, which is a very hot globally ice-free state, marked Hon the graph. However, for a wide range of intermediate L⊙, there are three solutions: a Snowball state ( Sn2), a partially ice covered state with a relatively large ice sheet (e.g. A), and a warmer state (e.g. B) which may have a small ice sheet or be ice free, depending on the precise value of L⊙. In the intermediate range of Solar constant, the warmest state is suggestive of the present or Pleistocene climate when there is a small ice-cap, and suggestive of Cretaceous-type hothouse climates when it is ice-free. In either case, the frigid Snowball state is available as an alternate possibility. As the parameter L⊙is increased smoothly from low values, the temperature of the the Snowball state increases smoothly but at some point an additional solution discontinuously comes into being at a temperature far from the previous equilibrium, and splits into a pair as L⊙is further increased. As L⊙is increased further, at some point, the intermediate temperature state merges with the snowball state, and disappears. This sort of behavior, in which the behavior of a system changes discontinuously as some control parameter is continuously varied, is an example of abifurcation . Finding the equilibria tells only part of the story. A system placed exactly at an equilbrium point will stay there forever, but what if it is made a little warmer than the equilibrium? Will it heat up yet more, perhaps aided by melting of ice, and ultimately wander far from the equilibrium? Or will it cool down and move back toward the equilibrium? Similar questions apply if the state is made initially slightly cooler than an equilibrium.

an equilibrium. This leads us to the question of stability . In order to address stability, we must ﬁrst write down an equation describing the time evolution of the system. To this end, we suppose that the mean energy storage per unit area of the planet’s surface can be written as a function of the mean temperature; let’s call this function E(Ts). Changes in the energy storage could represent the energy required to heat up or cool down a layer of water of some characteristic depth, and could also include the energy needed to melt ice, or released by the freezing of sea water. For our purposes, all we need to know is that Eis a monotonically increasing function of Ts. The energy balance for a time-varying system can then be written dE(Ts) dt=dE dTsdTs dt=G(Ts) (3.11) 3Of course, this is an unrealistic assumption, since a waterworld would inevitably have at least water vapor – a good greenhouse gas – in its atmosphere3.4.

Suppose that the slope of Gis well-deﬁned near Teq– in formal mathematical language, we say that Gis continuously diﬀerentiable at Teq, meaning that the derivative of Gexists and is a continous function for Tsin some neighborhood ofTeq. Then, if dG/dT s<0 at Ts, it will also be negative for some ﬁnite distance to the right and left of Ts. This is the case for points aandcin the net ﬂux curve sketched in Fig. 3.9. If the temperature is made a little warmer than Teqin this case, G(Ts) and hencedTs dtwill become negative and the solution will move back toward the equilibrium. If the temperature is made a little colder than Teq,G(Ts) and hencedTs dtwill become positive, and the solution will again move back toward the equilibrium. In contrast, if dG/dT s>0 near the equilibrium, as for point cin the sketch, a temperature placed near the equilibrium moves away from it, rather than towards it. Such equilibria are unstable . If the slope happens to be exactly zero at an equilibrium, one must look to higher derivatives to determine stability. These are ”rare” cases, which will be encountered only for very special settings of the parameters. If the d2G/dT2is non zero at the equilibrium, the curve takes the form of a parabola tangent to the axis at the equilibrium. If the parabola opens upwards, then the equilibrium is stable to displacements to the left of the equilibrium, but unstable to displacements to the right.

the right. If the parabola opens downwards, the equilibrium is unstable to displacements to the left but stable to displacements to the right. Similar reasoning applies to the case in which the ﬁrst non-vanishing derivative is higher order, but such cases are hardly ever encountered. Exercise 3.4.1 Draw a sketch illustrating the behavior near marginal equilibria with d2G/dT2>0 andd2G/dT2<0. Do the same for equilibria with d2G/dT2= 0, having d3G/dT3>0andd3G/dT3< 0 It is rare that one can completely characterize the behavior of a nonlinear system, but one dimensional problems of the sort we are dealing with are exceptional. In the situation depicted in Fig. 3.9, Gis positive and dT/dt is positive throughout the interval between bandc. Hence, a temperature placed anywhere in this interval will eventually approach the solution carbitrarily closely – it will be attracted to that stable solution. Similarly, if Tis initially between aandb, the solution will be attracted to the stable equilibrium a. The unstable equilibrium bforms the boundary between the basins of attraction ofaandc. No matter where we start the system within the interval between aandc(and somewhat beyond, depending on the shape of the curve further out), it will wind up approaching one of the two stable equilibrium states. In mathematical terms, we are able to characterize the global behavior of this system, as opposed to just the local behavior near equilibria. At an equilibrium point, the curve of solar absorption crosses the OLR curve, and the stability criterion is equivalent to stating that the equilibrium is stable if the slope of the solar curve is less than that of the OLR curve where the two curves intersect. Using this criterion, we see that the intermediate-temperature large ice-sheet states, labeled AandA/primein Fig.

AandA/primein Fig. 3.8, are unstable. If the temperature is made a little bit warmer then the equilibrium the climate will continue to warm until it settles into the warm state ( BorB/prime) which has a small or nonexistent ice sheet. If the temperature is made a little bit colder than the equilibrium, the system will collapse into the snowball state ( Sn2orSn3). The unstable state thus deﬁnes the boundary separating the basin of attraction of the warm state from that of the snowball state.3.4. ICE-ALBEDO FEEDBACK 53 TNetFlux Unstableequilibrium Stableequilibrium 0 a b c Figure 3.9: Sketch illustrating stable vs. unstable equilibrium temperatures. Moreover, if the net ﬂux G(T) is continous and has a continuous derivative (i.e. if the curve has no ”kinks” in it), then the sequence of consecutive equilibria always alternates between stable and unstable states. For the purpose of this theorem, the rare marginal states with dG/dT = 0 should be considered ”wildcards” that can substitute for either a stable or unstable state. The basic geometrical idea leading to this property is more or less evident from Figure 3.9, but a more formalized argument runs as follows: Let TaandTbbe equilibria, so that G(Ta) =G(Tb) = 0. Suppose that the ﬁrst of these is stable, so dG/dT < 0 at Ta, and also that the two solutions are consecutive, so that G(T) does not vanish for any Tbetween TaandTb. Now if dG/dT < 0 atTb, then it follows that G > 0 just to the left of Tb. The slope near Tasimilarly implies that G < 0 just to the right of Ta. Since Gis continuous, it would follow that G(T) = 0 somewhere between TaandTb.

between TaandTb. This would contradict our assumption that the two solutions are consecutive. In consequence, dG/dT ≥0 atTb. Thus, the state Tbis either stable or marginally stable, which proves our result. The proof goes through similarly if Tais unstable. Note that we didn’t actually need to make use of the condition that dG/dT be continuous everywhere: it’s enough that it be continuous near the equilibria, so we can actually tolerate a few kinks in the curve. A consequence of this result is that, if the shape of G(T) is controlled continously by some parameter like L⊙, then new solutions are born in the form of a single marginal state which, upon further change of L⊙splits into a stable/unstable or unstable/stable pair. The ﬁrst member of the pair will be unstable if there is a pre-existing stable solution immediately on the cold side of the new one, as is the case for the Snowball states Snin Fig. 3.8. The ﬁrst member will be stable if there is a pre-existing unstable state on cold side, or a pre-existing stable state on the warm side (e.g. the state Hin Fig. 3.8). What we have just encountered is a very small taste of the very large and powerful subject of bifurcation theory . 3.4.1 Faint Young Sun, Snowball Earth and Hysteresis We we now have enough basic theoretical equipment to take a ﬁrst quantitative look at the Faint Young Sun problem. To allow for the greenhouse eﬀect of the Earth’s atmosphere, we take prad= 670mb, which gives the correct surface temperature with the observed current albedo α=.3.54 CHAPTER 3. ELEMENTARY MODELS OF RADIATION BALANCE How much colder does the Earth get if we ratchet the Solar constant down to 960 W/m2, as it was 4.7 billion years ago when the Earth was new?

was new? As a ﬁrst estimate, we can compute the new temperature from Eq. 3.8 holding pradand the albedo ﬁxed at their present values. This yields 261 K. This is substantially colder than the present Earth. The ﬁxed albedo assumption is unrealistic,however, since the albedo would increase for a colder and more ice-covered Earth, leading to a substantially colder temperature than we have estimated. In addition, the strength of the atmospheric greenhouse eﬀect could have been diﬀerent for the Early Earth, owing to changes in the composition of the atmosphere. An attempt at incorporating the ice-albedo feedback can be made by using the energy balance Eq. 3.10 with the albedo parameterization given by Eq. 3.9. For this calculation, we choose constants in the albedo formula that give a somewhat more realistic Earthlike climate than those used in Figure 3.8. Speciﬁcally, we set αo=.28 to allow for the albedo of clouds and land, andTo= 295 to allow a slightly bigger polar ice sheet. The position of the equilibria can be determined by drawing a graph like Fig. 3.8, or by applying a root-ﬁnding algorithm like Newton’s method to Eq. 3.10. The resulting equilibria are shown as a function of L⊙in Figure 3.10, with pradheld ﬁxed at 670 mb. Some techniques for generating diagrams of this type are developed in the Problems. For the modern Solar constant, and prad= 670 mb, the system has a stable equilibrium atTs= 286 K, close to the observed modern surface temperature, and is partially ice covered. However, the system has a second stable equilibrium, which is a globally ice-covered Snowball state having Ts= 249 K. Even today, the Earth would stay in a Snowball state if it were somehow put there.

put there. The two stable equilibria are separated by an unstable equilibrium at Ts= 270 K, which deﬁnes the boundary between the set of initial conditions that go to the ”modern” type state, and the set that go to a Snowball state. The attractor boundary for the modern open-ocean state is comfortably far from the present temperature, so it would not be easy to succumb to a Snowball. Now we turn down the Solar constant, and re-do the calculation. For L⊙= 960 W/m2, there is only a single equilibrium point if we keep prad= 670 mb. This is a stable Snowball state with Ts= 228 K. Thus, if the Early Earth had the same atmospheric composition as today,leading to a greenhouse eﬀect no stronger than the present one, the Earth would have inevitably been in a Snowball state. The open ocean state only comes into being when L⊙is increased to 1330 W/m2, which was not attained until the relatively recent past. This contradicts the abundant geological evidence for prevalent open water throughout several billion years of Earth’s history. Even worse, if the Earth were initially in a stable snowball state four billion years ago, it would stay in that state until L⊙increases to 1640 W/m2, at which point the stable snowball state would disappear and the Earth would deglaciate. Since this far exceeds the present Solar constant, the Earth would be globally glaciated today. This even more obviously contradicts the data. The currently favored resolution to the paradox of the Faint Young Sun is the supposition that the atmospheric composition of the early Earth must have resulted in a stronger greenhouse eﬀect than the modern atmosphere produces. The prime candidate gases for mediating this change areCO2andCH4. The radiative basis of the idea will be elaborated further in Chapter 4, and some ideas about why the atmosphere might have adjusted over time so as to maintain an equable climate despite the brightening Sun are introduced in Chapter 9.

Chapter 9. Fig. 3.11 shows how the equilibria depend on prad, with L⊙ﬁxed at 960 W/m2. Whichever greenhouse gas is the Earth’s savior, if it is present in suﬃcient quantities to reduce pradto 500 mbor less, then a warm state with an open ocean exists (the upper branch in Fig. 3.11). However, for 420 mb < prad < 500mba stable snowball state also exists, meaning that the climate that is actually selected depends on earlier history. If the planet had already fallen into a Snowball state for some reason, the early Earth would stay in a Snowball unless the greenhouse gases build up suﬃciently to reduce pradbelow 420mbat some point.3.4.

ICE-ALBEDO FEEDBACK 57 Figures 3.10 and 3.11 illustrate an important phenomenon known as hysteresis : the state in which a system ﬁnds itself depends not just on the value of some parameter of the system, but the history of variation of that parameter.

that parameter. This is possible only for systems that have multiple stable states. For example, in 3.10 suppose we start with L⊙= 1000 W/m2, where the system is inevitably in a Snowball state with T= 230 K. Let’s now gradually increase L⊙. When L⊙ reaches 1500 W/m2the system is still in a Snowball state, having T= 254 K, since we have been following a stable solution branch the whole way. However, when L⊙reaches 1640 W/m2, the Snowball solution disappears, and the system makes a sudden transition from a Snowball state with T= 260 Kto the only available stable solution, which is an ice-free state having T= 301 K. AsL⊙increases further to 2000 W/m2, we follow the warm, ice-free state and the temperature rises to 316 K. Now suppose we begin to gradually dim the Sun, perhaps by making the Solar system pass through a galactic dust cloud. Now, we follow the upper, stable branch as L⊙decreases, so that when we ﬁnd ourselves once more at L⊙= 1500 W/m2the temperature is 294 Kand the system is in a warm, ice-free state rather than in the Snowball state we enjoyed the last time we were there. As L⊙is decreased further, the warm branch disappears at L⊙= 1330 W/m2and the system drops suddenly from a temperature of 277 Kinto a Snowball state with a temperature of 246K, whereafter the Snowball branch is again followed as L⊙is reduced further. The trajectory of the system as L⊙is increased then decreased back to its original value takes the form of an open loop, depicted in Fig. 3.10. The thought experiment of varying L⊙in a hysteresis loop is rather fanciful, but many atmospheric processes could act to either increase or decrease the greenhouse eﬀect over time.

over time. For the very young Earth, with L⊙= 960 W/m2, the planet falls into a Snowball when pradexceeds 500mb, and thereafter would not deglaciate until pradis reduced to 420 mbor less (see Fig. 3.11). The boundaries of the hysteresis loop, which are the critical thresholds for entering and leaving the Snowball, depend on the solar constant. For the modern solar constant, the hysteresis loop operates between prad= 690 mbandprad= 570 mb. It takes less greenhouse eﬀect to keep out of the Snowball now than it did when the Sun was fainter, but the threshold for initiating a Snowball in modern conditions is disconcertingly close to the value of pradwhich reproduces the present climate. The fact that the freeze-thaw cycle can exhibit hysteresis as atmospheric composition changes is at the heart of the Snowball Earth phenomenon. An initially warm state can fall into a globally glaciated Snowball if the atmospheric composition changes in such a way as to suﬃciently weaken the greenhouse eﬀect. Once the threshold is reached, the planet can fall into a Snowball relatively quickly – in a matter of a thousand years or less – since sea ice can form quickly. However, to deglaciate the Snowball, the greenhouse eﬀect must be increased far beyond the threshold value at which the planet originally entered the Snowball state. Atmospheric composition must change drastically in order to achieve such a great increase, and this typically takes many millions of years. When deglaciation ﬁnally occurs, it leaves the atmosphere in a hyper-warm state, which only gradually returns to normal as the atmospheric composition evolves in such a way as to re- duce the greenhouse eﬀect. As discussed in Chapter 1, there are two periods in Earth’s past when geological evidence suggests that one or more Snowball freeze-thaw cycles may have occurred.

have occurred. The ﬁrst is in the Paleoproterozoic, around 2 billion years ago. At this time, L⊙≈1170W/m2, and the thresholds for initiating and deglaciating a Snowball are prad= 600 mbandprad= 500 mbin our simple model. For the Neoproterozoic, about 700 million years ago, L⊙≈1290W/m2and the thresholds are at prad= 650 mbandprad= 540 mb. The boundaries of the hysteresis loop shift as the Solar constant increases, but there is nothing obvious in the numbers to suggest why a Snowball state should have occurred in the Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic but not at other times. Hysteresis associated with ice-albedo58 CHAPTER 3. ELEMENTARY MODELS OF RADIATION BALANCE feedback has been a feature of the Earth’s climate system throughout the entire history of the planet. Hysteresis will remain a possibility until the Solar constant increases suﬃciently to render the Snowball state impossible even in the absence of any greenhouse eﬀect (i.e. with prad= 1000mb). Could a Snowball episode happen again in the future, or is that peril safely behind us? These issues require an understanding of the processes governing the evolution of Earth’s atmosphere, a subject that will be taken up in Chapter 9. Exercise 3.4.2 Assuming an ice albedo of .6, how high does L⊙have to become to eliminate the possibility of a snowball state? Will this happen within the next ﬁve billion years? What if you assume there is enough greenhouse gas in the atmosphere to make prad/ps=.5? Note: The evolution of the Solar constant over time is approximately L⊙(t) =L⊙p·(.7 + (t/22.975) + ( t/14.563)2), where tis the age of the Sun in billions of years ( t= 4.6being the current age) and L⊙pis the present Solar constant.

Solar constant. This ﬁt is reasonably good for the ﬁrst 10 billion years of Solar evolution. The ”cold start” problem is a habitability crisis that applies to waterworlds in general. If a planet falls into a Snowball state early in its history, it could take billions of years to get out if one needs to wait for the Sun to brighten. The time to get out of a Snowball could be shortened if greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere, reducing prad. How much greenhouse gas must build up to deglaciate a snowball? How long would that take? What could cause greenhouse gases to accumulate on a Snowball planet? These important questions will be taken up in subsequent chapters. Another general lesson to be drawn from the preceding discussion is that the state with a stable, small icecap is very fragile, in the sense that the planetary conditions must be tuned rather precisely for the state to exist at all. For example, with the present Solar constant, the stable small icecap solution ﬁrst appears when pradfalls below 690 mb. However, the icecap shrinks to zero as pradis reduced somewhat more, to 615 mb. Hence, a moderate strengthening in the greenhouse eﬀect would, according to the simple energy balance model, eliminate the polar ice entirely and throw the Earth into an ice-free Cretaceous hothouse state. The transition to an ice-free state of this sort is continous in the parameter being varied; unlike the collapse into a snowball state or the recovery from a snowball, it does not result from a bifurcation. In light of its fragility, it is a little surprising that the Earth’s present small-icecap state has persisted for the past two million years, and that similar states have occurred at several other times in the past half billion years. Does the simple energy-balance model exaggerate the fragility of the stable small-icecap state?

small-icecap state? Does some additional feedback process adjust the greenhouse eﬀect so as to favor such a state while resisting the peril of the Snowball? These are largely unresolved questions. Attacks on the ﬁrst question require comprehensive dynamical models of the general circulation, which we will not encounter in the present volume. We will take up, though not resolve, the second question in Chapter9. It is worth noting that small-icecap states like those of the past two million years appear to be relatively uncommon in the most recent half billion years of Earth’s history, for which data is good enough to render a judgement about ice cover. The typical state appears to be more like the warm relatively ice-free states of the Cretaceous, and perhaps this reﬂects the fragility of the small-icecap state. The simple models used above are too crude to produce very precise hysteresis boundaries. Among the many important eﬀects left out of the story are water vapor radiative feedbacks, cloud feedbacks, the factors governing albedo of sea ice, ocean heat transports and variations in atmospheric heat transport. The phenomena uncovered in this exposition are general, however and can be revisited across a heirarchy of models. Indeed, the re-examination of this subject provides an unending source of amusement and enlightenment to climate scientists.3.4. ICE-ALBEDO FEEDBACK 59 3.4.2 Climate sensitivity, radiative forcing and feedback The simple model we have been studying aﬀords us the opportunity to introduce the concepts ofradiative forcing, sensitivity coeﬃcient andfeedback factor . These diagnostics can be applied across the whole spectrum of climate models, from the simplest to the most comprehensive. Suppose that the mean surface temperature depends on some parameter Λ, and we wish to know how sensitive Tis to changes in that parameter. For example, this parameter might be the Solar constant, or the radiating pressure.

radiating pressure. It could be some other parameter controlling the strength of the greenhouse eﬀect, such as CO2concentration. Near a given Λ, the sensitivity is characterized by dT/d Λ. LetGbe the net top-of-atmosphere ﬂux, such as used in Eq. 3.11. To allow for the fact that the terms making up the net ﬂux depend on the parameter Λ, we write G=G(T,Λ). If we take the derivative of the the energy balance requirement G= 0 with respect to Λ, we ﬁnd 0 =∂G ∂TdT dΛ+∂G ∂Λ(3.13) so that dT dΛ=−∂G ∂Λ ∂G ∂T(3.14) The numerator in this expression is a measure of the radiative forcing associated with changes in Λ. Speciﬁcally, changing Λ by an amount δΛ will perturb the top-of-atmosphere radiative budget by ∂G ∂ΛδΛ, requiring that the temperature change so as to bring the energy budget back into balance. For example, if Λ is the Solar constant L, then∂G ∂Λ=1 4(1−α). If Λ is the radiating pressure prad, then∂G ∂Λ=−∂OLR ∂prad. Since OLR goes up as pradis reduced, a reduction in pradyields a positive radiative forcing. This is a warming inﬂuence. Radiative forcing is often quoted in terms of the change in ﬂux caused by a standard change in the parameter, in place of the slope∂G ∂Λitself. For example, the radiative forcing due to CO2 is typically described by the change in ﬂux caused by doubling CO2from its pre-industrial value, with temperature and everything else is held ﬁxed.

held ﬁxed. This is practically the same thing as∂G ∂Λif we take Λ = log2pCO 2, where pCO 2is the partial pressure of CO2. Similarly, the climate sensitivity is often described in terms of the temperature change caused by the standard forcing change, rather than the slopedT dΛ. For example, the notation ∆ T2xwould refer to the amount by which temperature changes when CO2is doubled. The denominator of Eq. 3.14 determines how much the equilibrium temperature changes in response to a given radiative forcing. For any given magnitude of the forcing, the response will be greater if the denominator is smaller. Thus, the denominator measures the climate sensitivity . An analysis of ice-albedo feedback illustrates how a feedback process aﬀects the climate sensitivity. If we assume that albedo is a function of temperature, as in Eq. 3.9, then ∂G ∂T=−1 4L∂α ∂T−∂OLR ∂T(3.15) With this expression, Eq. 3.14 can be rewritten dT dΛ=−1 1 + Φ[∂G ∂Λ ∂OLR ∂T] (3.16) where Φ =1 4L∂α ∂T ∂OLR ∂T(3.17)60 CHAPTER 3. ELEMENTARY MODELS OF RADIATION BALANCE In writing this equation we primarily have ice-albedo feedback in mind, but the equation is valid for arbitrary α(T) so it could as well describe a variety of other processes. The factor in square brackets in Eqn. 3.16 is the sensitivity the system would have if the response were unmodiﬁed by the change of albedo with temperature. The ﬁrst factor determines how the sensitivity is increased or decreased by the feedback of temperature on albedo.

on albedo. If −1<Φ<0 then the feedback increases the sensitivity – the same radiative forcing produces a bigger temperature change than it would in the absence of the feedback. When Φ = −1 2, for example, the response to the forcing is twice what it would have been in the absence of the feedback. The sensitivity becomes inﬁnite as Φ → − 1, and for −2<Φ<−1 the feedback is so strong that it actually reverses the sign of the response as well as increasing its magnitude. On the other hand, if Φ >0, the feedback reduces the sensitivity. In this case it is a stabilizing feedback . The larger Φ gets, the more the response is reduced. For example, when Φ = 1 the response is half what it would have been in the absence of feedback. Note that the feedback term is the same regardless of whether the radiative forcing is due to changing L,prador anything else. As an example, let’s compute the feedback parameter Φ for the albedo-temperature relation given by Eq. 3.9, under the conditions shown in Fig. 3.10. Consider in particular the upper solution branch, which represents a stable partially ice-covered climate like that of the present Earth. At the point L= 1400 W/m2, T= 288 Kon this branch, we ﬁnd Φ = −.333. Thus, at this point the ice-albedo feedback increases the sensitivity of the climate by a factor of about 1 .5. At the bifurcation point L≈1330W/m2, T≈277K, Φ→ −1 and the sensitivity becomes inﬁnite. This divergence merely reﬂects the fact that the temperature curve is vertical at the bifurcation point. Near such points, the temperature change is no longer linear in radiative forcing.

radiative forcing. It can easily be shown that the temperature varies as the square root of radiative forcing near a bifurcation point, as suggested by the plot. The ice-albedo feedback increases the climate sensitivity, but other feedbacks could be sta- bilizing. In fact Eq. 3.17 is valid whatever the form of α(T), and shows that the albedo feedback becomes a stabilizing inﬂuence if albedo increases with temperature. This could conceivably hap- pen as a result of vegetation feedback, or perhaps dissipation of low clouds. The somewhat fanciful Daisyworld example in the Workbook section at the end of this chapter provides an example of such a stabilizing feedback. The deﬁnition of the feedback parameter can be generalized as follows. Suppose that the energy balance function Gdepends not only on the control parameter Λ, but also on some other parameter Rwhich varies systematically with temperature. In the previous example, R(T) is the temperature-dependent albedo. We write G=G(T, R(T),Λ). Following the same line of reasoning as we did for the analysis of ice-albedo feedback, we ﬁnd Φ =∂G ∂R∂R ∂T∂G ∂T(3.18) For example, if Rrepresents the concentration of water vapor on Earth, or of methane on Titan, and if Rvaries as a function of temperature, then the feedback would inﬂuence Gthrough the OLR . Writing OLR =OLR (T, R(T),Λ), then the feedback parameter is Φ =∂OLR ∂R∂R ∂T ∂OLR ∂T(3.19) assuming the albedo to be independent of temperature in this case. Now, since OLR increases with TandOLR decreases with R, the feedback will be destabilizing (Φ <0) if Rincreases with T. (One might expect Rto increase with Tbecause Clausius-Clapeyron implies that the saturation vapor pressure increases sharply with T, making it harder to remove water vapor by condensation,3.5.

by condensation,3.5. PARTIALLY ABSORBING ATMOSPHERES 61 all other things being equal). Note that in this case the water vapor feedback does not lead to a runaway, with more water leading to higher temperatures leading to more water in a never-ending cycle; the system still attains an equilibrium, though the sensitivity of the equilibrium temperature to changes in a control parameter is increased. 3.5 Partially absorbing atmospheres The assumption underpinning the blackbody radiation formula is that radiation interacts so strongly with matter that it achieves thermodynamic equilibrium at the same temperature as the matter. It stands to reason, then, that if a box of gas contains too few molecules to oﬀer much opportunity to intercept a photon, the emission will deviate from the blackbody law. Weak interaction with radiation can also arise from aspects of the structure of a material which inhibit interaction, such as the crystal structure of table salt or carbon dioxide ice. In either event, the deviation of emission from the Planck distribution is characterized by the emissivity . Suppose that I(ν,ˆn) is the observed ﬂux of radiation at frequency νemerging from a body in the direction ˆ n. Then the emissivity e(ν,ˆn) is deﬁned by the expression I(ν,ˆn) =e(ν,ˆn)B(ν, T) (3.20) where Tis the temperature of the collection of matter we are observing. Note that in assigning a temperature Tto the body, we are assuming that the matter itself is in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. The emissivity may also be a function of temperature and pressure. We can also deﬁne a mean emissivity over frequencies, and all rays emerging from a body. The mean emissivity is ¯e=/integraltext ν,Ωe(ν,ˆn)B(ν, T) cosθdνdΩ σT4(3.21) where θis the angle of the ray to the normal to the body’s surface and the angular integration is taken over the hemisphere of rays leaving the surface of the body.

the body. With this deﬁnition, the net ﬂux emerging from any patch of the body’s surface is F= ¯eσT4. Even if edoes not depend explicitly on temperature, ¯ ewill be temperature dependent if eis frequency dependent, since the relative weighting of diﬀerent frequencies, determined by B(ν, T) changes with temperature. A blackbody has unit emissivity at all frequencies and directions. A blackbody also has unit absorptivity, which is just a restatement of the condition that blackbodies interact strongly with the radiation ﬁeld. For a non-black body, we can deﬁne the absorptivity a(ν,ˆn) by shining light at a given frequency and direction at the body and measuring how much is reﬂected and how much comes out the other side. Speciﬁcally, suppose that we shine a beam of electromagnetic energy with direction ˆ n, frequency νand ﬂux Fincat the test object. Then we measure the additional energy ﬂux coming out of the object once this beam is turned on. This outgoing ﬂux may come out in many diﬀerent directions, because of scattering of the incident beam; in exotic cases, even the frequency could diﬀer from the incident radiation. Let TandRbe the transmitted and reﬂected energy ﬂux, integrated over all angles and frequencies. Then, the absorptivity is deﬁned by taking the ratio of the ﬂux of energy left behind in the body to the incident ﬂux. Thus, a(ν,ˆn) =Finc−(T+R) Finc(3.22) The Planck function is unambigously the natural choice of a weighting function for deﬁning the mean emissivity ¯ efor an object with temperature T. There is no such unique choice for deﬁning the mean absorptivity over all frequencies and directions.

and directions. The appropriate weighting function is62 CHAPTER 3. ELEMENTARY MODELS OF RADIATION BALANCE determined by the frequency and directional spectrum of the incident radiation which requires a detailed knowledge of its source. If the incident radiation is a blackbody with temperature Tsource then ¯ ashould be deﬁned with a formula like Eq. 3.20, using B(ν, Tsource as the weighting function. Note that the weighting function is deﬁned by the temperature of the source rather than by the temperature of the the object doing the absorbing. As was the case for mean emissivity, the temperature dependence of the weighting function implies that ¯ awill vary with Tsource even if a=a(ν) and is not explicitly dependent on temperature. Absorptivity and emissivity might appear to be independent characteristics of an object, but observations and theoretical arguments reveal an intimate relation between the two. This relation, expressed by Kirchhoﬀ’s Law of Radiation is a profound property of the interaction of radiation with matter that lies at the heart of all radiative transfer theory. Kirchoﬀ’s Law states that the emissivity of a substance at any given frequency equals the emissivity measured at the same frequency. It was ﬁrst inferred experimentally. The hard-working spectroscopists of the late nineteenth centuries employed their new techniques to measure the emission spectrum I(ν,ˆn, T) and absorptivity a(ν,ˆn, T) of a wide variety of objects at various temperatures. Kirchhoﬀ found that, with the exception of a few phosphorescent materials whose emission was not linked to temperature, all the experimental data collapsed onto a single universal curve, independent of the material, once the observed emission was normalized by the observed absorptivity. In other words, virtually all materials ﬁt the relation I(ν,ˆn, T)/a(ν,ˆn, T) =f(ν, T) with the same function f. If we take the limit of a perfect absorber – a perfectly ”black” body – then a= 1 and we ﬁnd that f is in fact what we have been calling the Planck function B(ν, T).

B(ν, T). In fact, it was this extrapolation to a perfect absorber that originally led to the formulation of the notion of blackbody radiation. Since f=BandI=eB, we recover the statement of Kirchoﬀ’s law in the form e/a= 1. The thought experiment sketched in Fig. 3.12 allows us to deduce Kirchhoﬀ’s law for the mean absorptivity and emissivity from the requirements of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. We consider two inﬁnite slabs of a blackbody material with temperature To, separated by a gap. Into the gap, we introduce a slab of partially transparent material with mean absorptivity ¯ a(T1) and mean emissivity ¯ e(T1), where T1is the temperature of the test material. Note that this system is energetically closed. We next require that the radiative transfer between the blackbody material and the test object cause the system to evolve toward an isothermal state. In other words we arepostulating that radiative heat transfers satisfy the Second Law. A necessary condition for radiative transfer to force the system to evolve towards an isothermal state is that the isothermal state To=T1be an equilibrium state of the system; if it weren’t an initially isothermal state would spontaneously generate temperature inhomogeneities. Energy balance requires that 2¯ a(To)σT4 o= 2¯e(T1)σT4 Kirchhoﬀ’s law then follows immediately by setting To=T1in the energy balance, which then implies ¯ a(To) = ¯e(To). Note that the mean absorptivity in this statement is deﬁned using the Planck function at the common temperature of the two materials as the weighting function. A modiﬁcation of the preceding argument allows us to show that in fact the emissivity and absorptivity should be equal at each individual frequency, and not just in the mean.

the mean. To simplify the argument, we will assume that eandaare independent of direction. The thought experiment we employ is similar to that used to justify Kirchhoﬀ’s Law in the mean, except that this time we interpose frequency-selective mirrors between the test object and the blackbody material, as shown in Fig. 3.13. The mirrors allow the test object to exchange radiant energy with the blackbody only in a narrow frequency band ∆ νaround a speciﬁed frequency ν. The energy budget for the test object now reads 2 e(ν)B(ν, T1)∆ν= 2a(ν)B(ν, To)∆ν. Setting T1=Toso that the isothermal state is an equilibrium, we ﬁnd that e(ν) =a(ν).

ELEMENTARY MODELS OF RADIATION BALANCE cation commonly given for Kirchhoﬀ’s Law. It is ultimately unsatisfying, as it applies equilibrium thermodynamic reasoning to a system in which the radiation ﬁeld is manifestly out of equilibrium with matter; in the frequency-dependent form, it invokes the existence of mirrors with hypothet- ical material properties; worse, it takes as its starting point that radiative heat transfer will act like other heat transfers to equalize temperature, whereas we really ought to be able to demon- strate such a property from ﬁrst principles of the interaction of radiation with molecules. The great mathematician David Hilbert, was among many who recognized these diﬃculties; in 1912 he presented a formal justiﬁcation that eliminated the involvement of hypothetical ideal selective mirrors. The physical content of Hilbert’s proof is that one doesn’t need an ideal mirror, if one requires that a suﬃcient variety of materials with diﬀerent absorbing and emitting properties will all come into an isothermal state at equilibrium. Hilbert’s deriviation nonetheless relied on an assumption that radiation would come into equilibrium with matter at each individual wavelength considered separately. While Kirchoﬀ did the trick with mirrors, Hilbert, in essence, did the trick with axioms instead, leaving the microscopic justiﬁcation of Kirchoﬀ’s Law equally obscure. It is in fact quite diﬃcult to provide a precise and concise statement of the circumstances in which a material will comply with Kirchoﬀ’s Law. Violations are quite commonplace in nature and in engi- neered materials, since it is quite possible for a material to store absorbed electromagnetic energy and emit it later, perhaps at a quite diﬀerent frequency.

diﬀerent frequency. A few examples that come to mind are phosphorescent (”glow in the dark”) materials, ﬂuorescence (e.g. paints that glow when exposed to ultraviolet, or ”black” light), frequency doubling materials (used in making green laser pointers), and lasers themselves. In Nature, such phenomena involve insigniﬁcant amounts of energy, and are of no known importance in determining the energy balance of planets. We will content ourselves here with the statement that all known liquid and solid planetary materials, as well as the gases making up atmospheres, conform very well to Kirchoﬀ’s Law, except perhaps in the most tenuous outer reaches of atmospheres where the gas itself is not in thermodynamic equilibrium. When applying Kirchhoﬀ’s law in the mean, careful attention must be paid to the weighting function used to deﬁne the mean absorptivity. For example, based on the incident Solar spectrum, the Earth has a mean albedo of about .3, and hence a mean absorptivity of .7. Does this imply that the mean emissivity of the Earth must be .7 as well? In fact, no such implication can be drawn, because Kirchhoﬀ’s Law only requires that the mean emissivity and absorptivity are the same when averaged over identical frequency weighting functions. Most of the Earth’s thermal emission is in the infrared, not the visible. Kirchhoﬀ’s law indeed requires that the visible wavelength emissivity is .7, but the net thermal emission of the Earth in this band is tiny compared to the infrared, and contributes almost nothing to the Earth’s net emission. Speciﬁcally, the Planck function implies that, at 255 Kthe emission in visible wavelengths is smaller than the emission in infrared wavelengths by a factor of about 10−19.

about 10−19. Thus, if the infrared emission from some region were 100 W/m2, the visible emission would be only 10−17W/m2. Using ∆ E=hνto estimate the energy of a photon of visible light, we ﬁnd that this amounts to an emission of only 50 visible light photons each second, from each square meter of radiating surface. This tiny outgoing thermal emission of visible light should not be confused with the much larger outgoing ﬂux of reﬂected solar radiation. It is a corollary of Kirchhoﬀ’s law that e≤1. If the emissivity were greater than unity, then by Kirchhoﬀ’s Law, the absorptivity would also have to be greater than unity. In consequence, the amount of energy absorbed by the body per unit time would be greater than the amount delivered to it by the incident radiation. By conservation of energy, that would imply the existence of an internal energy source. However, any internal energy source would ultimately be exhausted, violating the assumption that the system is in a state of equilibrium which can be maintained indeﬁnitely.3.6. OPTICALLY THIN ATMOSPHERES: THE SKIN TEMPERATURE 65 3.6 Optically thin atmospheres: The skin temperature Since the density of an atmosphere always approaches zero with height, in accordance with the hydrostatic law, one can always deﬁne an outer layer of the atmosphere that has so few molecules in it that it will have low infrared emissivity. We will call this the skin layer . What is the temperature of this layer? Suppose for the moment that it is transparent to solar radiation, and that atmospheric motions do not transport any heat into the layer; thus, it is heated only by infrared upwelling from below. Because the emissivity of the skin layer is assumed small, little of the upwelling infrared will be absorbed, and so the upwelling infrared is very nearly the same as theOLR .

theOLR . The energy balance is between absorption and emission of infrared. Since the skin layer radiates from both its top and bottom, the energy balance reads 2eirσT4 skin=eirOLR. (3.23) Hence, Tskin=1 21 4(OLR σ)1 4=1 21 4Trad (3.24) where Tradis deﬁned as before. Thus, the skin temperature is colder than the blackbody radiating temperature by a factor of 2−1 The skin temperature is the natural temperature the outer regions of an atmosphere would have in the absence of in situ heating by solar absorption or other means. Note that the skin layer does not need any interior heat transfer mechanism to keep it isothermal, since the argument we have applied to determine Tskinapplies equally well to any sublayer of the skin layer. A layer that has low emissivity, and hence low absorptivity, in some given wavelength band is referred to as being optically thin in this band. A layer could well be optically thick in the infrared, but optically thin in the visible, which is in fact the case for strong greenhouse gases. Now let’s suppose that the entire atmosphere is optically thin, right down to the ground, and compute the pure radiative equilibrium in this system in the absence of heat transfer by convection. We’ll also assume that the atmosphere is completely transparent to the incident Solar radiation. Let Sbe the incident Solar ﬂux per unit surface area, appropriate to the problem under consideration (e.g.1 4L⊙for the global mean or L⊙for temperature at the subsolar point on a planet like modern Mars). Since the atmosphere has low emissivity, the heating of the ground by absorption of downwelling infrared emission coming from the atmosphere can be neglected to lowest order. Since the ground is heated only by absorbed Solar radiation, its temperature is determined byσT4 s= (1−α)S, just as if there were no atmosphere at all.

at all. In other words, prad=psbecause the atmosphere is optically thin, so that the atmosphere does not aﬀect the surface temperature no matter what its temperature structure turns out to be. Next we determine the atmospheric temperature. The whole atmosphere has small but nonzero emissivity so that the skin layer in this case extends right to the ground. The atmosphere is then isothermal, and its temperature Tais just the skin temperature 2−1/4Ts. The surface is thus considerably warmer than the air with which it is in immediate contact. There would be nothing unstable about this situation if radiative transfer were truly the only heat transfer mechanism coupling the atmosphere to the surface. In reality, the air molecules in contact with the surface will acquire the temperature of the surface by heat conduction, and turbulent air currents will carry the warmed air away from the surface, forming a heated, buoyant layer of air. This will trigger convection, mixing a deep layer of the atmosphere within which the temperature proﬁle will follow the adiabat. The layer will grow in depth until the temperature at the top of the mixed layer matches the skin temperature, eliminating the instability. This situation is66 CHAPTER 3. ELEMENTARY MODELS OF RADIATION BALANCE Temperatureps0 TsTskinptrop Figure 3.14: The unstable pure radiative equilibrium for an optically thin atmosphere (solid line) and the result of adjustment to the adiabat by convection (dashed line). The adjustment of the temperature proﬁle leaves the surface temperature unchanged in this case, because the atmosphere is optically thin and has essentially no eﬀect on the OLR . depicted in Figure 3.14. The isothermal, stably stratiﬁed region above the mixed region is the stratosphere in this atmosphere, and the lower, adiabatic region is the troposphere; the boundary between the two is the tropopause.

the tropopause. We have just formulated a theory of tropopause height for optically thin atmospheres. To make it quantitative, we need only require that the adiabat starting at the surface temperature match to the skin temperature at the tropopause. Let psbe the surface pressure and ptropbe the tropopause pressure. For the dry adiabat, the requirement is then Ts(ptrop/ps)R/cp=Tskin. Since Ts= 21/4Tskin, the result is ptrop ps= 2−cp 4R (3.25) Note that the tropopause pressure is aﬀected by R/cp, but is independent of the insolation S. The stratosphere in the preceding calculation diﬀers from the observed stratosphere of Earth in that it is isothermal rather than warming with altitude. The factor we have left out is that real stratospheres often contain constituents that absorb solar radiation. To rectify this shortcoming, let’s consider the eﬀect of solar absorption on the temperature of the skin layer. Let eirbe the infrared emissivity, which is still assumed small, and aswbe the shortwave (mostly visible) absorptivity, which will also be assumed small. Note that Kirchhoﬀ’s Law does not require eir= asw, as the emissivity and absorptivity are at diﬀerent wavelengths. The energy balance for the3.6. OPTICALLY THIN ATMOSPHERES: THE SKIN TEMPERATURE 67 skin layer now reads eirσT4=eirOLR +aswS (3.26) Hence, T=Tskin(1 +asw eirS OLR)1 4 (3.27) where Tskinis the skin temperature in the absence of Solar absorption. The formula shows that Solar absorption always increases the temperature of the skin layer.

skin layer. The temperature increases as the ratio of shortwave absorption to infrared emissivity is made larger. So long as the temperature remains less than the Solar blackbody temperature, the system does not violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics, since the radiative transfer is still acting to close the gap between the cold atmo- spheric temperature and the hot Solar temperature. As the atmospheric temperature approaches that of the Sun, however, it would no longer be appropriate to use the infrared emissivity, since the atmosphere would then be radiating in the shortwave range. Kirchoﬀ’s Law would come into play, requiring a/e= 1. This would prevent the atmospheric temperature from approaching the photospheric temperature. If the shortwave absorptivity is small, the skin layer can be divided into any number of sublayers, and the argument applies to determine the temperature of each one individually. This is so because the small absorptivity of the upper layers do not take much away from the Solar beam feeding absorption in the lower layers. We can then infer that the temperature of an absorbing stratosphere will increase with height if the absorption increases with height, making asw/eir increase with height. Armed with our new understanding of the optically thin outer portions of planetary atmo- spheres, let’s take another look at a few soundings. The skin temperature, deﬁned in Eq 3.24, provides a point of reference. It is shown for selected planets in Table 3.3. Except for the Martian case, these values were computed from the global mean OLR , either observed directly (for Jupiter) or inferred from the absorbed Solar radiation. In the Martian case, the fast thermal response of the atmosphere and ocean makes the global mean irrelevant. Hence, assuming the atmosphere to be optically thin, we compute the skin temperature based on the upwelling infrared from a typical daytime and night-time surface temperature corresponding to the Martian soundings of Figure 2.3.

Figure 2.3. The tropical Earth atmosphere sounding shown in Fig. 2.1 shows that the temperature increases sharply with height above the tropopause. This suggests that solar absorption is important in the Earth’s stratosphere. For Earth, the requisite solar absorption is provided by ozone, which strongly absorbs Solar ultraviolet. This is the famous ”ozone layer,” which shields life on the surface from the sterilizing eﬀects of deadly Solar ultraviolet rays. However, it is striking and puzzling that vir- tually the entire stratosphere is substantially colder than the skin temperature based on the global mean radiation budget. The minimum temperature in the sounding is 188 K, which is fully 26 K below the skin temperature. If anything, one might have expected the tropical temperatures to exceed the global mean skin temperatures, because the local tropospheric temperatures are warmer than the global mean. A reasonable conjecture about what is going on is that high, thick tropical clouds reduce the local OLR , thus reducing the skin temperature. However, the measured tropical OLR In Fig. 3.7 shows that at best clouds reduce the tropical OLR to 240 W/m2, which yields the same 214 Kskin temperature computed from the global mean budget. Apart from possible eﬀects of dynamical heat transports, the only way the temperature can fall below the skin temperature is if the infrared emissivity becomes greater than the infrared absorptivity. This is possible, without violating Kirchoﬀ’s law, if the spectrum of upwelling infrared is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the spectrum of infrared emitted by the skin layer. We will explore this possibility in the next chapter. Referring to Fig. 2.3 we see that the temperature of the Martian upper atmosphere declines steadily with height, unlike Earth; this is consistent with Mars’ CO2atmosphere, which has only68 CHAPTER 3.

Table 3.3: Computed skin temperatures of selected planets. relatively weak absorption in the Solar near infrared spectrum. The Martian upper atmosphere presents the same quandary as Earth’s though, in that the temperatures fall well below the skin temperature estimates. Just above the top of the Venusian troposphere, there is an isothermal layer with temperature 232 K, just slightly higher than the computed skin temperature. However, at higher altitudes, the temperature falls well below the skin temperature, as for Mars. Between 500 mband 100 mb, just above Titan’s troposphere, Titan has an isothermal layer with temperature of 75 K, which is very close to the skin temperature. Above 100 mb, the at- mosphere warms markedly with height, reaching 160 Kat 10 mb. The solar absorption in Titan’s stratosphere is provided mostly by organic haze clouds. Jupiter, like Titan, has an isothermal layer just above the troposphere, whose temperature is very close to the skin temperature. Jupiter’s atmosphere also shows warming with height; its upper atmosphere becomes nearly isothermal at 150K, which is 44 Kwarmer than the skin temperature. This indicates the presence of solar ab- sorbers in Jupiter’s atmosphere as well, though the solar absorption is evidently more uniformly spread over height on Jupiter than it is on Earth or Titan. We have been using the term ”stratosphere” rather loosely, without having attempted a precise deﬁnition. It is commonly said, drawing on experience with Earth’s atmosphere, that a stratosphere is an atmosphereic layer within which temperature increases with height. This would be an overly restrictive and Earth-centric deﬁnition. The dynamically important thing about a stratosphere is that it is much more stably stratiﬁed than the troposphere, i.e.

troposphere, i.e. that its temperature goes down less steeply than the adiabat appropriate to the planet under consideration. The stable stratiﬁcation of a layer indicates that convection and other dynamical stirring mechanisms are ineﬀective or absent in that layer, since otherwise the potential temperature would become well mixed and the temperature proﬁle would become adiabatic. An isothermal layer is stably stratiﬁed, because its potential temperature increases with height; even a layer like that of Mars’ upper atmosphere, whose temperature decreases gently with height, can be stably stratiﬁed. We have shown that an optically thin stratosphere is isothermal in the absence of solar absorption. Indeed, this is often taken as a back-of-the envelope model of stratospheres in general, in simple calculations. In the next chapter, we will determine the temperature proﬁle of stratospheres that are not optically thin. In a region that is well mixed in the vertical, for example by convection, will have a tem- perature that decreases with height. Dynamically speaking, such a mixed layer constitutes the troposphere. By contrast the stratosphere may be deﬁned as the layer above this, within which vertical mixing plays a much reduced role. Note, however, that the temperature minimum in a pro- ﬁle need not be coincident with the maximum height reached by convection; will revisit this matter in Chapter 7. Yet a further complication is that, in midlatitudes, large scale winds associated with storms are probably more important than convection as the stirring mechanism establishing the tropopause.3.6. OPTICALLY THIN ATMOSPHERES: THE SKIN TEMPERATURE 69 We conclude this chapter with a few comparisons of observed tropopause heights with the predictions of the optically thin limit. We’ll leave Venus out of this comparison, since its atmosphere is about as far from the optically thin limit as one could get.

could get. On Mars, using the dry adiabat for CO2and a 6 mbsurface pressure puts the tropopause at 2 .8mb, which is consistent with the top of the region of steep temperature decline seen in the daytime Martian sounding in Fig. 2.3. For Titan, we use the dry adiabat for N2and predict that the tropopause should be at 816 mb,which is again consistent with the sounding. If we use the methane/nitrogen moist adiabat instead of the nitrogen dry adiabat, we put the tropopause distinctly higher, at about 440 mb. Because the moist adiabatic temperature decreases less rapidly with height than the dry adiabat, one must go to greater elevations to hit the skin temperature (as in Fig. 3.14). The tropopause height based on the saturated moist adiabat is distinctly higher that seems compatible with the sounding, from which we infer that the low levels of Titan must be undersaturated with respect to Methane. Using R/cp=2 7for Earth air and 1000 mbfor the surface pressure, we ﬁnd that the Earth’s tropopause would be at 545 mbin the optically thin, dry limit. This is somewhat higher in pressure (lower in altitude) that the actual midlatitude tropopause, and very much higher in pressure than the tropical tropopause. Earth’s real atmosphere is not optically thin, and the lapse rate is less steep than the dry adiabat owing to the eﬀects of moisture. The eﬀects of optical thickness will be treated in Chapter 7, but we can already estimate the eﬀect of using the moist adiabat. Using the computation of the water-vapor/air moist adiabat described in Chapter 2, the tropopause rises to 157 mb, based on a typical tropical surface temperature of 300 Kand the skin temperature estimated in Table 3.3.

Table 3.3. This is much closer to the observed tropopause (deﬁned as the temperature minimum in the sounding), with the remaining mismatch being accounted for by the fact that the minimum temperature is appreciably colder than the skin temperature.70 CHAPTER 3. ELEMENTARY MODELS OF RADIATION BALANCEChapter 4 Radiative transfer in temperature-stratiﬁed atmospheres 4.1 Overview 4.2 Basic Formulation of Plane Parallel Radiative Transfer We will suppose that the properties of the radiation ﬁeld and the properties of the medium through which it travels are functions of a single coordinate, which we will take to be the pressure in a hydrostatically balanced atmosphere. (Recall that in such an atmosphere there is a one to one correspondence between pressure and altitude). This is the plane-parallel assumption. Although the properties of planetary atmospheres vary geographically with horizontal position within the spherical shell making up the atmosphere, in most cases it suﬃces to divide up the sphere into patches of atmosphere which are much larger in the horizontal than they are deep, and over which the properties can be considered horizontally uniform. In this case, vertical radiative transfer is much more important than horizontal transfer, and the atmosphere can be divided up into a large number of columns that act independently, insofar as radiative transfer is concerned. In this section, we will develop an approximate form of the equations of plane parallel ra- diative transfer. The errors introduced in this approximation are small enough that the resulting equations are suﬃciently accurate to form basis of the infrared radiative transfer component of vir- tually all large scale climate models. These equations will certainly be good enough for addressing the broad-brush climate questions that are our principal concern. 4.2.1 Optical thickness and the Schwarzschild equations Although the radiation ﬁeld varies in space only as a function of pressure, p, its intensity depends also on direction.

on direction. Let I(p,ˆn, ν) be the ﬂux density of electromagnetic radiation propagating in direction ˆ n, measured at point p. This density is just like the Planck function B(ν, T), except that 7172CHAPTER 4. RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN TEMPERATURE-STRATIFIED ATMOSPHERES Δτ*}θΒΔτ*/cosθI(τ*)–I(τ*)Δτ*/cosθ I(τ*) Figure 4.1: Sketch of the radiative energy balance for a slab of atmosphere illuminated by incident radiation from below. we allow it to depend on direction and position. Now we suppose that the radiation propagates through a thin layer of atmosphere of thickness ∆ pas measured by pressure. The absorption of energy at frequency νis proportional to the number of molecules of absorber encountered; assuming the mixing ratio of the absorber to be constant within the layer for small ∆ p, the number of molecules encountered will be proportional to ∆ p, in accord with the hydrostatic law. By Kirchoﬀ’s law, the absorptivity and emissivity of the layer are the same; we’ll call the value ∆τ, and keep in mind that in general it will be a function of ν. Let θbe the angle between the direction of propagation ˆ nand the vertical, as shown in Figure 4.1. Now, let ∆ τ∗be the emissivity (and absorptivity) of the layer for radiation propagating in the direction θ= 0. We may deﬁne the proportionality between emissivity and pressure through the relation ∆ τ∗=−κ∆p/gwhere g is the acceleration of gravity and κis an absorption coeﬃcient. It has units of area per unit mass, and can be thought of as an absorption cross-section per unit mass – in essence, the area taken out of the incident beam by the absorbers contained in a unit mass of atmosphere.

of atmosphere. In general κis a function of frequency, pressure, temperature and the mixing ratios of the various greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Passing to the limit of small ∆ p, we can deﬁne an optical thickness coordinate through the diﬀerential equation dτ∗ dp=−1 gκ (4.1) Since pressure decreases with altitude, τ∗increases with altitude. Radiation propagating at an angle θrelative to the vertical acts just like vertically propagating radiation, except that the thickness of each layer through which the beam propagates, and hence the number of absorbing molecules encountered, is increased by a factor of 1 /cosθ. Hence, the optical thickness for radiation propagating with angle θis simply τ=τ∗/cosθ. From now on, we will use τ∗in place of pas the vertical coordinate, and only transform back to pressure coordinates when necessary. Consider now the situation illustrated in Fig. 4.1, in which radiation at a given frequency and angle is incident on slab of atmosphere from below. In general, part of the incident radiation is scattered into other directions. However, for infrared and longer wave radiation interacting with gases, such scattering is negligible; scattering is also negligible for infrared interacting with condensed cloud particles made of substances such of water, which are strong absorbers. Here, we shall neglect scattering, though it will be brought back into the picture in Chapter 5. The radiation at the same angle which comes out the top of the slab is then the incident ﬂux minus the small amount absorbed in the slab, plus the small amount emitted. Thus I(τ∗+ ∆τ∗,ˆn, ν) = (1 −∆τ∗ cosθ)I(τ∗,ˆn, ν) +B(ν, T(τ∗))∆τ∗ cosθ(4.2)4.2.

The angular distribution of radiation changes with distance from the source, since radiation propagating near the direction θ= 0 or θ=πdecays more gradually than radiation with θnearer to π/2. Hence, radiation that starts out isotropic at the source (as is the blackbody emission) tends to become more forward-peaked as it propagates. For some specialized problems, it is indeed necessary to solve for the angular distribution explicitly in this fashion, which is rather computationally demanding. Fortunately, the isotropy of the blackbody source term tends to keep longwave radiation isotropic enough to allow one to make do with a much more economical approximate set of equations. We can derive an equation for the net upward ﬂux per unit frequency, I+, by multiplying Eq. 4.3 by cos θand integrating over all solid angles in the upward-pointing hemisphere. Integrating over the downward hemisphere yields the net downward ﬂux I−. However, because of the factor 1/cosθon the right hand side of Eq. 4.3, the hemispherically averaged intensity appearing on the right hand side is not I+. Instead, it is/integraltext I(τ∗,ˆn, ν)dΩ, or equivalently/integraltextπ/2 02πI(τ∗, θ, ν) sinθdθ.

ν) sinθdθ. One cannot proceed further without some assumption about the angular distribution. If we assume that the distribution remains approximately isotropic, by virtue of the isotropic source B, then I(τ∗, θ, ν) is independent of θ, and hence the problematic integral becomes 2 πI/integraltextπ/2 0sinθdθwhich is equal to 2 I+under the assumption of isotropy. This result yields a close equation for I+. It states that, if the radiation ﬁeld remains approximately isotropic, the decay rate is the same as for unidirectional radiation propagating with an angle ¯θsuch that cos ¯θ=1 2, i.e. θ= 60o. We will absorb this factor of 1 /cos¯θinto a redeﬁned optical depth τν=τ∗/cos¯θ. In some cases, one can do better than the pure isotropy assumption by choosing ¯θto optimize the ﬁt to an angularly resolved calculation, but that is a reﬁnement we shall not pursue. In terms of the redeﬁned τν, the equations for the upward and downward ﬂux are d dτνI+=−I++πB(ν, T(τν)) d dτνI−=I−−πB(ν, T(τν))(4.4) These are known as the two-stream equations , and will serve as the basis for all subsequent discus- sion of radiative transfer in this book, save that we will incorporate the neglected scattering term in Chapter 5. Because of the neglect of scattering, the equations for I+andI−are uncoupled, and each consists of a linear, inhomogeneous ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation. The solution can be obtained by substituting I+=A(τν) exp(−τν), and similarly for I−, which reduces the problem to evaluation of a deﬁnite integral for A.

The result is I+(τν) =I+(0)e−τν+/integraldisplayτν 0πB(ν, T(τ/prime ν))e−(τν−τ/prime ν)dτ/prime ν I−(τν) =I−(τ∞)e−(τ∞−τν)+/integraldisplayτ∞ τνπB(ν, T(τ/prime ν))e−(τ/prime ν−τν)dτ/prime ν(4.5) where τ/prime νis a dummy variable. Note that τ∞depends on νin general, though we have suppressed the subscript for the sake of readability. The physical content of these equations is simple: I+(τν)74CHAPTER 4. RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN TEMPERATURE-STRATIFIED ATMOSPHERES is an exponentially-weighted average of the emission from all layers below τν, with more distant layers given progressively smaller weights. Similarly, I−(τν) is an exponentially-weighted average of the emission from all layers above τν. The radiation escaping to space will be most sensitive to temperatures near the top of the atmosphere, while the downward radiation into the ground will be most sensitive to temperatures nearest the ground. I+(0) is the upward radiation emitted by the ground, or e(ν)B(ν, Tg) where e(ν) is the emissivity of the ground and Tgis the ground temperature. We generally assume that there is no infrared radiation incident on the top of the atmosphere, so that the upper boundary condition is I−(τ∞) = 0. The incident solar radiation does contain some near-infrared, but this is usually treated separately as part of the shortwave radiation calculation (see Chapter 5). For planets orbiting stars with cool photospheres, such as red giant stars, it might make sense to allow I−(τ∞) to be nonzero and treat the incoming infrared simultaneously with the internally generated thermal infrared.

thermal infrared. Since the radiative transfer equations are linear in the intensities, it is a matter of taste whether to treat the incoming stellar infrared in this way, or as part of the calculation dealing with the shorter wave part of the incoming stellar spectrum. The main reason for dealing with radiative transfer in the atmosphere is that one needs to know the amount of energy deposited in or withdrawn from a layer of atmosphere by radiation. This is the radiative heating rate (with negative heating representing a cooling). It is obtained by taking the derivative of the net ﬂux, which gives the diﬀerence between the energy entering and leaving a thin layer. The heating rate per unit optical thickness, per unit frequency, is thus Hν=−d dτν(I+(τν, ν)−I−(τν, ν)) (4.6) This must be integrated over all frequencies to yield the net heating rate. For making inferences about climate, one ordinarily requires the heating rate per unit mass rather than the heating rate per unit optical depth. This is easily obtained using the deﬁnition of optical depth, speciﬁcally, Hν=gd dp(I+−I−) =gdτν dpd dτν(I+−I−) =κ cos¯θHν (4.7) In mks units, this heating rate has units W/Kg . One can convert into a temperature tendency K/s by dividing this value by the speciﬁc heat cp. 4.2.2 Some special solutions of the Two-Stream equations Beer’s law Suppose that the atmosphere is too cold to radiate signiﬁcantly at the frequency under consider- ation. In that case, B(ν, T)≈0 and the internal source vanishes. This would be the case, for example, if νis in the visible light range and the temperature of the atmosphere is Earthlike.

is Earthlike. In this case, the solutions are simply I+=I+(0) exp( −τν) and I−=I−(τ∞)exp(τν−τ∞). The exponential attenuation of radiation is known as Beer’s Law . Here we’ve neglected scattering, but in Chapter 5 we’ll see that a form of Beer’s law still applies even if scattering is taken into account. Inﬁnite isothermal medium Consider next an unbounded isothermal medium. In this case, it is readily veriﬁed that I+= I−=πB(ν, T) is an exact solution to 4.5. The right hand sides of the equations vanish, but the derivatives on the left hand sides vanish also, because Tis independent of τν. Hence, in an unbounded isothermal medium, the radiation ﬁeld reduces to uniform blackbody radiation.4.2. BASIC FORMULATION OF PLANE PARALLEL RADIATIVE TRANSFER 75 Since the ﬂuxes are independent of p, the radiative heating rate vanishes, from which we recover the fact that blackbody radiation is in equilibrium with an extended body of isothermal matter. Finite-thickness isothermal slab Now let’s consider an isothermal layer of ﬁnite thickness, embedded in an atmosphere which is completely transparent to radiation at frequency ν. We suppose further that there is no radiation at this frequency incident on the layer from either above or below. We are free to deﬁne τν= 0 at the center of the layer, so that τν=1 2τ∞at the top of the layer and τν=−1 2τ∞at the bottom. The boundary conditions corresponding to no incident ﬂux are I−= 0 at the top of the layer andI+= 0 at the bottom of the layer.

the layer. The solution I+=I−=πBis still a particular solution within the layer, since the layer is isothermal, but it does not satisfy the boundary conditions. A homogeneous solution must be added to each in order to satisfy the boundary conditions. The homogeneous solutions are just exponentials, and so we easily ﬁnd that the full solution within the layer is I+(τν) = [1−exp(−(τ+τ∞ 2))]πB I−(τν) = [1−exp(+( τ−τ∞ 2))]πB(4.8) The radiation emitted out the top of the layer is I+(τ∞), or (1 −exp(−τ∞))πB, which reduces to the blackbody value πBwhen the layer is optically thick for the frequency in question, i.e. τ∞(ν)/greatermuch1. The same applies for the emission out of the bottom of the layer, mutatis mutandum . Note that in the optically thick limit, I+=I−=πBthrough most of the layer, and the inward-directed intensities only fall to zero in the two relatively thin skin layers near the top and bottom of the slab. In the opposite extreme, when the slab is optically thin, both τandτ∞are small. Using the ﬁrst order Taylor expansion of the exponentials, we ﬁnd that the emission out the top of the layer is τ∞πB, and similarly for the bottom of the layer. Hence, τinfty in this case is just the bulk emissivity of the layer. This is consistent with the way we constructed the Schwarzschild equations, which can be viewed as a matter of stacking a great number of individually optically thin slabs upon each other. Substituting into Eq. 4.6, the heating rate for this solution is Hν=−[exp(−τ) + exp( τ)] exp(−τ∞ 2)πB (4.9) In the optically thick case, the heating rate is nearly zero in the interior of the slab, but there is strong radiative cooling within about a unit optical depth of each surface.

each surface. In this case the radiation drains heat out of a thin skin layer near each surface, causing intense cooling there. In the optically thin limit, the cooling is distributed uniformly throughout the slab. It turns out that condensed water is a much better infrared absorber than the same mass of water vapor. Hence, an isolated absorbing layer such as we have just considered can be thought of as a very idealized model of a cloud. The following slight extension makes the connection with low lying stratus clouds, such as commonly found over the oceans, more apparent.76CHAPTER 4. RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN TEMPERATURE-STRATIFIED ATMOSPHERES Exercise 4.2.1 Instead of being suspended in an inﬁnite transparent medium, suppose that the cloud is in contact with the ground, and that the ground has the same temperature as the cloud. We still assume that the air above the cloud is transparent to radiation at the frequency under consideration. Compute the upward and downward ﬂuxes, and the radiative heating rate, in this case. This exercise shows that convection in boundary layer stratus clouds can be driven by cooling at the top, rather than heating from below. This is rather important, since the reﬂection of sunlight by the cloud makes it hard to warm up the surface. Entrainment of dry air due to top-driven convection is one of the main mechanisms for dissipating such clouds. Optically thick limit We now depart from the assumption of constant temperature. While allowing Tto vary in the vertical, we assume the atmosphere to be optically thick at frequency ν. This means that a small change in pressure pamounts to a large change in the optical thickness coordinate τν. Referring, to Eq. 4.1, we see that the assumption of optical thickness is equivalent to the assumption that κδp/g /greatermuch1, where δpis the typical amount by which one has to change the pressure in order for the temperature to change by an amount comparable to its mean value.

mean value. For most atmospheres, it suﬃces to take δpto be the depth of the whole atmosphere, namely ps, so that the optical thickness assumption becomes τ∞κps/g/greatermuch1 Since κdepends on frequency, an atmosphere may be optically thick near one frequency, but optically thin near another. Examining the expression for I+(τν) shown in Eq. 4.5, we see that values of τ/prime νsigniﬁcantly more than one optical depth away from τνare exponentially downweighted, and contribute little to the integral. Over the range of τ/prime νfor which the integrand is non-negligible, T(τ/prime ν) is nearly constant. Hence in the integral for I+we can substitute the two-term Taylor expansion for temperature, T(τ/prime ν) =T(τν) +dT/dτ nu·(τ/prime ν−τν). Substituting this into the expression for I+and carrying out the integral, we ﬁnd I+(ν, τν) =πB(ν, T(τν))−πdB dTdT dτν(4.10) The boundary term proportional to I+(0) is neglected because it is exponentially small when τ∞ is large. The exponentially small term arising from the lower limit of integration in Eq. 4.5 has also been dropped. Using identical reasoning, the downward ﬂux becomes I−(ν, τν) =πB(ν, T(τν)) +πdB dTdT dτν(4.11) In both expressions, the second term is small because dT/dτ νis small. To lowest order, then, the upward and downward ﬂuxes are both equal to the blackbody radiation ﬂux at the local temperature.

local temperature. In this sense, the optically thick limit looks ”locally isothermal.” The correction terms give the small deviation from locally isothermal behavior. Substituting the approximate forms of I+andI−into the expression for the radiative heating rate yields Hν=d dτν[2πdB dTdT dτν] (4.12)4.3. THE GREY GAS MODEL 77 Hence, in the optically thick limit, the heating and cooling caused by radiative transfer acts just like a thermal diﬀusion, with the diﬀusivity given by D(ν, τν) = 2 πdB dT|T=T(τν) (4.13) Optically thin limit The optically thin limit is deﬁned by τ∞/lessmuch1. Since τν≤τ∞andτ/prime ν≤τin Eq. 4.5, all the exponentials in the expression for the ﬂuxes are close to unity. Moreover, the integral is carried out over the small interval [0 , τν], and hence is already of order τ∞or less. It is thus a small correction to the ﬁrst term, and we may set the exponentials in the integrand to unity and still have an expression that is accurate to order τ∞. With these approximations, the ﬂuxes become I+(τν) =I+(0)(1−τν) +/integraldisplayτν 0πB(ν, T(τ/prime ν))dτ/prime ν I−(τν) =I−(τ∞)(1−(τ∞−τν)) +/integraldisplayτ∞ τνπB(ν, T(τ/prime ν))dτ/prime ν(4.14) B(¯Tν, ν)≡1 τ∞/integraldisplayτν 0B(ν, T(τ/prime ν))dτ/prime ν (4.15) I+(τ∞) = (1 −τ∞)I+(0) + τ∞πB(¯Tν, ν) I−(0) = (1 −τ∞)I−(τ∞) +τ∞πB(¯Tν, ν)(4.16) Hν= (I+(0) + I−(τ∞))−2πB(ν, T(τν)) (4.17) 4.3 The Grey Gas Model The problem posed by wavenumber-dependent optical depth.

optical depth. The grey-gas approximation ( κ, hence optical depth, independent of frequency). Why study grey gases. With the possible exception of cloud infrared eﬀects, they are not a very good model of the way real atmospheres behave. Nonetheless, they are worth studying for two reasons. First, they are analytically tractable, so that many of the basic kinds of phenomena that apply to real gases can be laid bare for the student. Second, grey gas models provide an important ”placeholder” radiation scheme for use with idealized climate models aimed at looking at basic phenomena (cf. Tapio Schneider or Dargan Frierson); using grey gas models allows one to force a model with something more like the natural forcing, but without confronting the computational expense or complexity of real gas radiation. Keeping things simple is important, because the behavior of complex models is harder to interpret, and one wouldn’t want to needlessly engage the full complexity of real gas radiation if the resulting radiative phenomena were not central to the matter one is studying. The grey gas versions of the two-stream Schwarzschild equations are obtained by making τν independent of frequency and integrating the resulting equations over all frequencies. The result is d dτI+=−I++σT(τ)4 d dτI−=I−−σT(τ)4(4.18)78CHAPTER 4. RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN TEMPERATURE-STRATIFIED ATMOSPHERES Grey gas versions of the solutions given in the previous section can similarly be obtained by integrating the relations over all frequencies, taking into account that τis now independent of ν. The expressions have precisely the same form as before, except that I+andI−now represent total ﬂux integrated over all frequencies, and every occurence of πBis replaced by σT4. 4.3.1 OLR for an all-troposphere dry atmosphere Let’s consider an atmosphere for which the convection is so deep that it establishes a dry adiabat throughout the depth of the atmosphere.

the atmosphere. Thus, T(p) =Ts(p/ps)R/cpall the way to p= 0. We wish to compute the OLR for this atmosphere, which is done by substituting this T(p) into Eq. ? ?and evaluating the integral for I+atτ=τ∞, i.e. the top of the atmosphere. Since the temperature is expressed as a function of pressure, it is necessary to substitute for pressure in terms of optical thickness in order to carry out the integral. We’ll suppose that κis a constant, so that τ∞−τ=κp/g =τ∞p/ps. Using this to eliminate pressure from T(p), the integral for OLR becomes OLR =I+(0)e−τ∞+/integraldisplayτ∞ 0σT4 s(τ∞−τ/prime τ∞)4R/cpe−(τ∞−τ/prime)dτ/prime =I+(0)e−τ∞+/integraldisplayτ∞ 0σT4 s(τ1 τ∞)4R/cpe−τ1dτ1 =I+(0)e−τ∞+σT4 sτ−4R/cp ∞/integraldisplayτ∞ 0τ4R/cp 1 e−τ1dτ1(4.19) The second line is derived by introducing a new dummy variable τ1=τ∞−τ/prime. This is the the optical depth measured relative to the top of the atmosphere, and the re-expressed integral is computed by integrating from the top down, rather than from the ground up. The ﬁrst term on the right hand side of Eq. 4.19 represents the proportion of the upward surface radiation which survives absorption by the atmosphere and reaches space. The second term is the net emission from the atmosphere.

the atmosphere. In the optically thick limit, τ∞/greatermuch1, the ﬁrst term becomes exponentially small and the upper limit of the integral can be replaced by ∞, yielding the expression OLR =σT4 sτ−4R/cp ∞ Γ(1 +4R cp) (4.20) where Γ is the Gamma function, deﬁned by Γ( s)≡/integraltext∞ 0ζs−1exp(−ζ)dζ. Using integration by parts, Γ( s) = ( s−1)Γ(s−1), while Γ(1) = 1, so Γ( n) = ( n−1)!. For Earth air, 4 R/cp=8 7so Γ(1 + 4 R/cp) will be close to Γ(2), which is unity; in fact it is approximately 1 .06. For any of the gases commonly found in planetary atmospheres, Γ(1 + 4 R/cp) will be an order unity constant. Recall that σT4 rad=OLR , so σT4 s(prad ps)4R/cp=OLR =σT4 sτ−4R/cp ∞ Γ(1 +4R cp) (4.21) whence ( prad/ps) =τ−1 ∞(Γ(1 + 4 R/cp))cp/4R 4.3.2 Eﬀect of an isothermal stratosphere on OLR Eﬀect of an isothermal stratosphere.

THE GREY GAS MODEL 79 4.3.3 A ﬁrst look at the runaway greenhouse We have seen in Chapter 2 that the mass of an atmosphere in equilibrium with a reservoir of condensed substance (e.g.

substance (e.g. a water ocean) is not ﬁxed. It increases with temperature in accordance with the dictates of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. If the condensible substance is a greenhouse gas, then the optical thickness τ∞increases with temperature. This tends to reduce the OLR , oﬀsetting or even reversing the tendency of rising temperature to increase the OLR . What are the implications of this for the dependence of OLR on surface temperature, and for planetary energy balance? We’ll take a ﬁrst look at this problem here, in the context of the grey-gas model. In the general case, we’d like to consider an atmosphere in which the condensible greenhouse gas is mixed with a noncondensible background of ﬁxed mass (which may also have a greenhouse eﬀect of its own). This is the case for water vapor in the Earth’s atmosphere, for methane on Titan, and probably also for water vapor in the early atmosphere of Venus. It could also have been the case for mixed nitrogen- CO2atmospheres on Early Mars, with CO2playing the role of the condensible component. We will eventually take up such atmospheres, but the diﬃculty in computing the moist adiabat for a two-component atmosphere introduces some distractions which get in the way of grasping the key phenomena. Hence, we’ll start with the simpler case in which the atmosphere consists of a pure condensible component in equilibrium with a reservoir (an ”ocean,” or perhaps a glacier). In this case, the saturated moist adiabat is given by the simple analytic formula Eq. 2.21, obtained by solving the simpliﬁed form of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation for temperature in terms of pressure. We’ve already seen in Chapter 2 that a mixed atmosphere is dominated by the condensible component at large temperatures, so if we are primarily interested in the large-temperature behavior, the use of the one-component condensible atmosphere is not at all a bad approximation.

bad approximation. We write T(p) =To/(1−RTo Llnp po), where ( po, To) are a ﬁxed reference temperature and pressure on the saturation curve, such as the triple point temperature and pressure. If the surface pressure is ps, then the surface temperature is Ts=T(ps). Hence, specifying surface pressure is equivalent to specifying surface temperature in this problem. To keep the algebra simple, we’ll assume a constant speciﬁc absorption κ. Then τ∞=κps/g, which increases as Tsis made larger. Further, for constant speciﬁc absorption, p/po= (τ∞−τ/prime)/τowhere τo=κpo/g. Now, the choice of the reference temperature and pressure ( po, To) is perfectly arbitrary, and we’ll get the same answer now matter what choice we make (within the accuracy of the approximate form of Clausius- Clapeyron we are using). Hence, we are free to pick posuch that τo= 1. Tothen implicitly depends onκ, and becomes larger as κgets smaller. Tois the temperature at the level of the atmosphere where the optical depth measured relative to the top of the atmosphere is unity. Substituting the one-component T(p) into the integral giving the solution to the Schwarzschild equation, and substituting for pressure in terms of optical thickness, we ﬁnd OLR =I+(0)e−τ∞+/integraldisplayτ∞ 0σT4 o (1−RTo Llnp po)4e−(τ∞−τ/prime)dτ/prime =I+(0)e−τ∞+σT4 o/integraldisplayτ∞ 01 (1−RTo Llnτ1)4e−τ1dτ1(4.22) where we have in the second line deﬁned a new dummy variable τ1=τ∞−τ/primeas before.

τ1=τ∞−τ/primeas before. The surface temperature enters the expression for OLR only through τ∞, which is proportional to surface pressure. In the optically thin limit, the integral on the right hand side of the expression is small (because τ∞is small). This happens at low surface temperatures, because psis small when the surface temperature is small. The OLR then reduces to the ﬁrst term, which is approximately80CHAPTER 4.

Calculations were done for thermodynamic parameters corresponding to water vapor, and with g= 10m/s2. Results are shown for two diﬀerent values of the speciﬁc absorption cross-section. I+(0),i.e. the unmodiﬁed upward radiation from the surface. In the optically thick limit, which occurs for high surface temperatures, the term proportional to I+(0) is negligible, and the second term dominates. This term consists of the ﬂux σT4 omultiplied by a non-dimensional integral. Recall that Tois a constant dependent on the thermodynamic and infrared optical properties of the gas making up the atmosphere; it does not change with surface temperature. Because of the decaying exponential in the integrand, the integral is dominated by the contribution from the vicinity of τ1= 0, and will therefore become independent of τ∞for large τ∞. In the optically thick (high temperature) limit, then, the integral is a function of RTo/Lalone. From this we conclude that the OLR becomes independent of surface temperature in the limit of large surface temperature (and hence large τ∞).

large τ∞). This limiting OLR is known as the Kombayashi-Ingersoll limit . It was originally studied in connection with the long-term history of water on Venus, using a somewhat diﬀerent argument than we have presented here. We shall use the term to refer to a limiting OLR arising from the evaporation of any volatile greenhouse gas reservoir, whether computed using a grey gas model or a more realistic radiation model. It is readily veriﬁed that the integral multiplying σT4 oapproaches unity as RTo/Lapproaches zero. In fact, for typical atmospheric gases L/R is a very large temperature, on the order of several thousand Kelvins. Hence, unless the speciﬁc absorption is exceedingly small, RTo/Ltends to be small, typically on the order of .1 or less. For RTo/L=.1, the integral has the value of .905. Thus, the limiting OLR is essentially σT4 o. Recalling that Tois the temperature of the moist adiabat at one optical depth unit down from the top of the atmosphere, we see that the limiting OLR behaves very nearly as if all the longwave radiation were emitted from a layer one optical depth unit from the top of the atmosphere.

The Sleep post-bolide rainout calculation. 4.3.4 Pure radiative equilibrium for a grey gas atmosphere For the temperature proﬁles discussed in Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.3, the net infrared radiative heating computed from Eq. 4.6 is nonzero at virtually all altitudes; generally it is negative, and acts to cool the atmosphere. These temperature proﬁles can be maintained in equilibrium only if some other heat transport mechanism makes up the deﬁcit. It is implicit in these solutions that convection will supply whatever heating is necessary to keep the atmosphere in a steady state. The atmosphere/surface system is in radiative equilibrium as a unit, but it need not be in radiative equilibrium at each altitude individually, since convection can redistribute heat in the vertical so as to maintain equilibrium Now, we’ll investigate solutions for which, in contrast, the net radiative heating vanishes individually at each altitude. Such solutions are in pure radiative equilibrium , as apposed to radiative-convective equilibrium . First we’ll consider the case in which the only radiative heating is supplied by infrared; later we’ll bring heating by atmospheric solar absorption into the picture. Assuming the atmosphere to be transparent to solar radiation, pure radiative equilibrium requires that the frequency-integrated longwave radiative heating Hvanish for all τ. From the grey gas version of Eq. 4.6, we then conclude that I+−I−is independent of τ. Applying the upper boundary condition, we ﬁnd that this constant is I+(τ∞), which is the OLR . Now, by taking the diﬀerence between the equations for I+andI−we ﬁnd 0 =d dτ(I+−I−) =−(I++I−) + 2σT4(4.23) which gives us the temperature in terms of ( I++I−).

( I++I−). Next, taking the sum of the equations for I+andI−yields d dτ(I++I−) =−(I+−I−) =const =−OLR (4.24) In consequence, 2σT4= (I++I−) = (1 + τ∞−τ)OLR (4.25) where we have again used the boundary condition at τ∞. This expression gives us the pure radiative equilibrium temperature proﬁle T(τ). In pure radiative equilibrium, the temperature always approaches the skin temperature at the top of the atmosphere, where τ=τ∞. This recovers the result obtained in the previous chapter, in Section 3.6. When the atmosphere is optically thin, τ∞−τis small throughout the atmosphere, and the entire atmosphere becomes isothermal with temperature equal to the skin temperature. When the atmosphere is not optically thin, the temperature decreases gently with height, approaching the skin temperature as the top of the atmosphere is approached. Eq. 4.25 also gives us the upward and downward ﬂuxes, since we now know both I+−I− andI++I−at each τ. In particular, the downward ﬂux into the ground is I−(0) =1 2((I++I−)−(I+−I−)) =1 2((1 + τ∞)OLR−OLR ) =1 2τ∞OLR (4.26)82CHAPTER 4. RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN TEMPERATURE-STRATIFIED ATMOSPHERES For an optically thin atmosphere, the longwave radiation returned to the ground by the atmosphere iss only a small fraction of that emitted to space. A the atmosphere becomes optically thick, the radiation returned to the ground becomes much greater than that emitted to space, because the radiative equilibrium temperature near the ground becomes large and the optical thickness implies that the radiation into the ground is determined primarily by the low level temperature.

level temperature. If we assume the planet to be in radiative equilibrium with the absorbed solar radiation (1 −α)S, where αis the albedo of the ground, then OLR = (1−α)Sand the radiative energy budget of the ground is σT4 s= (1−α)S+I−(0) = (1 −α)S·(1 +1 2τ∞) (4.27) where Tsis the surface temperature. This, together with the temperature proﬁle determined by Eq. 4.25, determines what the thermal state of the system would be in the absence of heat transport mechanisms other than radiation. For an optically thin atmosphere, the surface temperature is only slightly greater than the no-atmosphere value. As τ∞becomes large, the surface temperature increases without bound. Note that, while this formula yields a greenhouse warming of the surface, the relation between surface temperature and τ∞is diﬀerent from that given by the all-troposphere radiative convective calculation in Eq. ? ?, because the pure radiative equilibrium temperature proﬁle is diﬀerent from the adiabat which would be established by convection. Let’s now compare the surface temperature with the temperature of the air in immediate contact with the surface. From Eq. 4.25 we ﬁnd that the low level air temperature is determined byσT(0)4= (1−α)S·(1 2+1 2τ∞) Thus, the surface is always warmer than the overlying air in immediate contact with it. In the previous chapter, we saw that this was the case for pure radiative equilibrium in an optically thin atmosphere, but now we have generalized it ot arbitrary optical thickness. As before, this is a very unstable situation. Under the action of diﬀusive or turbulent heat transfer between the surface and the nearby air, a layer of air near the surface will heat up to the temperature of the surface, whereafter it will be warmer than the air above it.

above it. Being buoyant, it will rise and lead to convection, which will stir up some dept of the atmosphere and establish an adiabat – creating a troposphere. In pure radiative equilibrium, the surface heating inevitably gives rise to convection. How- ever, it is also possible that the temperature proﬁle in the interior of the atmosphere may become unstable to convection, even without the beneﬁt of a surface. This is a particularly important pos- sibility to consider for gas giant planets, which have no distinct surface to absorb solar radiation and stimulate convection. Taking the derivative of 4.25 with respect to optical thickness, we ﬁnd 8σT3dT dτ=−OLR (4.28) whence, using d/dp = (dτ/dp )(d/dτ), we ﬁnd 1 TdT dp=−1 41 (1 +τ∞−τ)dτ dp(4.29) Note that this slope, and hence the stability criterion, is independent of the OLR . Given that theOLR is equal to the energy sources driving the planet’s atmosphere, this result says that the degree of instability is independent of the magnitude of the planet’s energy source. R cp≥ −1 4pdτ dp1 (1 +τ∞−τ)(4.30) In the case of constant absorption coeﬃcient κ, we have pdτ/dp =−κp/g cos¯θ, which is just4.4. REAL GAS RADIATION 83 τ−τ∞.

is1 4τ∞/(1+τ∞). The more optically thick the atmosphere is, the more unstable it is near the ground. For large optical thickness, the stability criterion becomes the remarkably simple statement 4 R/cp≥1. Dry Earth air, with R/cp= 2/7, just misses being unstable by this criterion. Generally speaking, a sharp decrease of absorption coeﬃcient with height tends to destabilize the atmosphere, particularly if it occurs in a place where the atmosphere is optically thick. The easiest way to get such a sharp decrease is for the concentration of longwave absorbers to decrease sharply with height. 4.4 Real gas radiation 4.4.1 General considerations First some observations.

planetary albedo. However, clouds play a critical role in planetary climate, and a certain amount of treatment of scattering is needed if one is to understand things like the importance of particle size. I would prefer not to have to incorporate a chapter on scattering, since it is already well treated in many books on radiative transfer, but in order to keep this course self-contained, it is necessary to have this chapter. This chapter will be kept fairly concise. It will be limited to two-stream approximations to the scattering equations (which have been shown to be suﬃcient for most climate purposes), including the widely-used δ-eddington formulation for clouds. It would cover Rayleigh scattering and have a resum´ e of Mie theory. For planetary climates (notably Titan and Early Mars), it is necessary to simultaneously treat gaseous absorption of IR and scattering of IR by clouds. This is a topic that is little-discussed in existing texts, and I will give a fair amount of attention to it here, concentrating on exponen- tial sum approaches. I will also present some Monte-Carlo simulations highlighting the essential diﬃculty of the problem. Aside from the discussion of IR scattering, this chapter would go beyond what is available in other texts, because of the general computational philosophy of the entire book, which will be adhered to here: All algorithms used in results discussed in the chapter will be provided as Python scripts which the student can use for further exploration, in conjunction with the Workbook. 8586 CHAPTER 5. SCATTERINGChapter 6 The surface energy balance This chapter includes some observations of the Earth’s surface radiation budget, but it is more focused on theory and models than the previous chapter. It deals with paleoclimatic and planetary implications as well as the present Earth climate. The focus is on the way in which the physics of surface energy ﬂux determines the surface temperature of a planet with a condensed surface (solid or liquid).

For moist systems, we point out the importance of water-vapor buoyancy (and its generalizations) in destabilizing boundary layers with the surface colder than the free atmosphere. 8788 CHAPTER 6. THE SURFACE ENERGY BALANCE 6.7 Models of surface temperature This section ﬁrst uses the preceding results to determine the temperature diﬀerence between the surface and the free atmosphere, with the free-atmospheric temperature held ﬁxed. For example, we show that over dry surfaces like desert, the surface temperature can greatly exceed the air temperature, whereas over moist surfaces the temperature diﬀerence must generally remain small. Then the full problem, coupled to a radiative-convective model, is treated. It is pointed out that the surface problem becomes decoupled from the TOA radiative-convective problem when the atmosphere is optically thick in the infrared. In this section, we also illustrate the eﬀect of clouds on the surface temperature and surface energy budget, in cases where the clouds have zero net eﬀect (visible minus IR) on the TOA budget. 6.8 Observations of the Earth’s surface energy budget 6.9 Precipitation-temperature relations Here we discuss the factors constraining precipitation.

constraining precipitation. The discussion follows the lines of my dis- cussion of the subject in my Nature article on deep-time hydrological cycle problems. The general theme is the importance of the surface budget constraint for precipitation, when the temperature is high. 6.10 The Martian boundary layer 6.11 Sea ice and snow eﬀects This section discusses what happens when the surface can melt. Steady-state sea ice and snow models are discussed here. The eﬀect on the seasonal cycle is discussed in the next chapter. The basic idea, though, is that when the temperature reaches the melting point, energy goes into latent heat of melting rather than increasing the surface temperature. It is pointed out that this idea generalizes to any melting surface, and not just water ice. The case of sublimation is also discussed. Thermodynamic sea ice models.

Grey gas models of water vapor feedback. Generalization to feedback by similar substances (condensible CO2, or methane). 7.2 Surface vs. Top of Atmosphere Budgets: Who controls the surface temperature? Discuss why factors that aﬀect the TOA radiation budget have much more leverage over the surface temperature than things that aﬀect the surface budget. It’s true that TOA changes work their way into the surface budget, because the low level air temp. changes, and this changes all ﬂuxes between the atmosphere and surface. However these surface ﬂux changes are a cause, not an eﬀect. This can be clariﬁed by using a grey-gas model coupled to a simple surface turbulent exchange scheme. First look at what happens if we make the atmosphere more optically thick aloft, throwing oﬀ the TOA budget. Look at how surface adjusts, for various ﬂux coupling coeﬃcients. Then do a case where we increase the downward radiation to the surface by increasing the low 8990 CHAPTER 7.

CHAPTER 7. RADIATIVE-CONVECTIVE MODELS level optical thickness (e.g. add a low cloud), without aﬀecting the OLR. What does this do to surface temperature? Note that when the upper atmosphere is already optically thick, increasing the low level opacity doesn’t change the atmospheric cooling, since increased emission to ground is oﬀset by decreased loss of downwelling IR from aloft, and increased emission to upper atmosphere; this does change the amount of convective heat transport, though. What happens if the upper atmosphere is optically thin, though? (e.g. if we have a pure nitrogen atmosphere and introduce a surface cloud layer?) In that case, the increased emissivity could change the OLR (indirectly, through its eﬀect on surface temperature). This is a good case to analyze closely. Could also look at what happen if we put in a cloud that reduces surface solar absorption, but leaves TOA budget unchanged. (Do equilibrium case only). Bottom line is that, with enough surface moisture, surface budget perturbations aﬀect precip more than temperature. Exception is dry land, where surface balance can add appreciable warming to the general atmospheric warming. Note that some aspects of this problem (e.g. the buﬀering of surface budget changes by ”stiﬀness” provided by evaporative heat transfer) where already discussed in the surface budget chapter. 7.3 Real gas atmospheres Numerical solutions for radiative-convective equilibrium for real gases. 7.4 Sensitivity of climate to CO 2changes Glacial-interglacial cycles.

vapor feedback. Discuss what climate would be like with just water vapor feedback and no CO2. How close would orbit have to be in order to have an equable climate without CO2. These estimates will be based on clear-sky radiation, with a few remarks about how clouds complicate the picture. 7.5 The atmosphere as a heat engine In this section, we use the results of Chapter 2 to do vertically integrated budgets of atmospheric dry static energy and of entropy. The consequences of these budgets are discussed. An important aspect of atmospheric operation is that there is a pressure diﬀerence between where energy is put into the system (near the surface) and aloft (where energy is lost by IR emission). The climate is an open system, energetically. It is true that the rate of energy ﬂowing in is equal to the rate ﬂowing out, but the behavior of the system is strongly inﬂuenced by the fact that energy ﬂows through the system – speciﬁcally that energy comes in in the form of Solar radiation, and goes out in the form of longer wavelength radiation (typically infrared).7.6. EFFECT OF THE DIURNAL CYCLE ON TROPOPAUSE HEIGHT 91 Conventional thermodynamic analysis uses pressure and volume. It is possible to do this for the atmosphere, but volume isn’t a very natural thermodynamic variable for atmospheric work. Discuss how to avoid explicit use of volume by using the dry (or moist) static energy. (height Z replaces volume). Idealized atmospheric Carnot cycle: Put heat in by solar heating of air in contact with ground at ps. Lift adiabatically to pradand lose heat by IR radiative cooling there. Compress adiabatically back to surface pressure and start over. Note that this process is not a closed loop: the surface temperature you wind up with is lower than what you started with, so you can sustain a bit of mechanical work with that temperature diﬀerence.

temperature diﬀerence. (Estimate this). This process is not quite like the classic Carnot cycle. Note that with latent heat, the atmosphere is like a steam engine (or, following Pauluis, maybe more like a dehumidiﬁer). 7.6 Eﬀect of the diurnal cycle on tropopause height 7.7 The runaway greenhouse revisited Radiative-convective model calculations of runaway greenhouse.

Need for consideration of CO2clouds, which will be taken up in next chapter. 7.9 Titan The Methane greenhouse eﬀect on Titan. Methane condensation feedback (analogous to water vapor feedback). Note that Nitrogen also condenses at Titan temperatures, so that mass of atmo- sphere changes with the climate. Since Methane clouds are also infrared scatterers rather than absorbers, a full treatment of Titan’s climate also requires IR scattering theory, developed in next chapter.

next chapter. On Titan (and92 CHAPTER 7. RADIATIVE-CONVECTIVE MODELS perhaps Early Earth), high altitude tholin clouds are also important. 7.10 Gas Giants Two features distinguish the problem for gas giants like Jupiter or Saturn: (1) There is no surface to absorb solar radiation, so solar energy is deposited entirely by internal absorption in the Atmo- sphere; (2) Interior ﬂuid motions can eﬃciently transport heat from the deep interior to the upper layers, and can yield a heat source comparable to solar absorption. The latter eﬀect is weak on solid planets like Earth, since ﬂuid motions in the very viscous mantle are sluggish. This section explores the consequence of the above features, in radiative-convective models. The use of planetary energy balance observations in determining the relative role of interior and Solar heat sources was already discussed in Chapter 3.Chapter 8 Variation of temperature with season and latitude Why is the Earth generally hotter near the Equator than at the poles? Why is it generally hotter in Summer than in Winter, especially outside the tropics? Would this be true on other planets as well? How would the pattern change over time, as features of the planet’s orbit vary? More generally, in this section we seek to understand the features of a planet that determine the magnitude and pattern of geographic and seasonal variations in temperature. 8.1 A few observations of the Earth First, let’s take a look at how the Earth’s surface temperature varies with the seasons. Figure 8.1 shows the zonal-mean air temperature near the surface for representative months in each of the four seasons. The ﬁrst thing we note is that the temperature is fairly uniform in the tropics (30S-30N), but declines sharply as the poles are approached. The temperature diﬀerence between the Equator and 60N is 39K in the Winter but only 12K in the Summer.

the Summer. The Southern Hemisphere has a much weaker seasonal cycle, except over the Antarctic continent: The temperature diﬀerence between the Equator and 60S is 26K in the Winter and 22K in the Summer. However, over Antarctica, poleward of 60S the seasonal cycle is extreme. Noting that the Northern Hemisphere has more land than the Summer, the data imply that the oceans have a strong moderating eﬀect on the seasonal cycle. The temperature patterns in Figure 8.1 are what we seek to explain in terms of the response of climate to the geographically and seasonally varying Solar forcing. An even better appreciation of the eﬀect of land masses on the seasonal cycle can be obtained by examining the map of July-January temperature diﬀerences, shown in Figure 8.1. This map shows that the strongest seasonal temperature contrast occurs in the interior of large continents, and that the ocean temperature varies by at most a few degrees over the year – and even less in the Tropics. The strong seasonal cycle of the Northern Hemisphere continents extends very little beyond the coastlines, and the seasonal cycle of the Northern oceans has similar magnitude to that of the more extensive Southern oceans. 9394 CHAPTER 8.

Computed from NCEP data for 1970-2000. 8.2 Distribution of incident solar radiation The geographical variations of temperature are driven by variations in the amount of sunlight falling on each square meter of surface, and also by variations in albedo. Seasonal variations are driven by changes in the geographical distribution of absorbed sunlight as the planet proceeds through its orbit. Therefore, the starting point for any treatment of seasonal and geographical variation must be the study of how the light of a planet’s sun is distributed over the spherical surface of the planet.

the planet. This section dealso only with the distribution of incident sunlight, or insolation . The geographical distribution of the amount of sunlight absorbed is aﬀected also by the distribution of the albedo. The albedo variations can also aﬀect the seasonal distribution of solar forcing through seasonal variations in ice,snow, cloud and vegetation cover. It will help to ﬁrst consider an airless planet, so that we don’t at once have to deal with the possible eﬀects of scattering of the solar beam by the atmosphere. If our planet is far from its Sun, as compared to the radius of the Sun, the sunlight encountering the planet comes in as a beam of parallel rays with ﬂux L. Even if the surface of the planet is perfectly absorbing, the sunlight the planet intercepts is not spread uniformly over its surface; per unit area, parts of the planet where the sun is directly overhead receive a great deal of energy, whereas parts where the Sun grazes the surface at a shallow angle receive little, because the small amount of sunlight intercepted is spread over a comparatively large area, as shown in Figure 8.2. The night side of the planet, of course, receives no solar energy at all. To obtain a general expression for the distribution of incident solar radiation per unit of surface area, we may divide up the surface of the planet into a great many small triangles, and consider each one individually. The solar energy intercepted by a triangle is determined by the area of the shadow that would be cast by the triangle on a screen oriented perpendicular to the solar beam. To compute this area, suppose that one of the vertices of the triangle is located at8.2.

the triangle. To obtain the area of the shadow cast by the triangle, we apply the cross product to the projection of the vectors /vector r1and/vector r2onto the plane. These projections are given by /vector r1−ˆz /vector r1·ˆzand/vector r2−ˆz /vector r2·ˆz, where ˆ zis the unit vector pointing in the direction of the Sun. The cross product of these two vectors is (/vector r1−ˆz /vector r1·ˆz)×(/vector r2−ˆz /vector r2·ˆz) =/vector r1×/vector r2−(ˆz×/vector r2)(/vector r1·ˆz)−(/vector r1×ˆz)(/vector r2·ˆz) (8.1) Now, the cross product of two vectors in the xyplane must point in the direction of the zaxis. Hence, we can obtain the magnitude of the above vector by taking its dot product with ˆ z. This is very convenient, since the dot product of ˆ zwith the second two terms vanishes, leaving us with 2A⊥= ˆz·(/vector r1×/vector r2) = 2 Aˆz·ˆn= 2Acos(ζ) (8.2) where A⊥is the area of the shadow and ζis the angle between the normal to the patch of surface and the direction of the sun. This is known as the zenith angle . When the the zenith angle is zero,96 CHAPTER 8. VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE WITH SEASON AND LATITUDE the Sun is directly overhead, and when it is 90othe sunlight comes in parallel to the surface and leaves no energy behind.

energy behind. Zenith angles greater than 90oare unphysical, since they represent light that would have to pass through the solid body of the planet in order to illuminate the underside of the surface; these are on the night side of the planet. If one draws a line from the center of the planet to the center of the Sun, the zenith angle will be zero where the line intersects the surface of the planet; this is the subsolar point . At any given instant, the curves of constant zenith angle make a set of concentric circles centered on the subsolar point, with a zenith angle of 90oalong the great circle which at the given instant separates the dayside of the planet from the nightside. If the surface were in equilibrium with the instantaneous incident solar ﬂux, the subsolar point would be the hottest spot on the planet, with temperature falling to zero with distance away from the hot spot. As the planet rotates through its day/night cycle, a given point of the surface is swept through a range of distances from the hot spot, leading to a diurnal temperature variation. As the planet proceeds through its orbit in the course of the year, the diurnal cycle will change as the orientation of the planet’s rotation axis changes relative to the Sun. Insofar as the surface actually takes a ﬁnite amount of time to heat up or cool down, the diurnal cycle will be attenuated to one extent or another. As the next step toward realism, let’s now consider a rapidly rotating planet whose axis of rotation is perpendicular to the line connecting the center of the planet to the center of its Sun. If the axis of rotation is in fact perpendicular to the plane of the orbit, this situation prevails all year round; otherwise, the condition is met only at the equinoxes, and indeed the condition deﬁnes the equinoxes. We assume that the planet is rotating rapidly enough that the day-night diﬀerence in solar radiation is averaged out and the corresponding temperature ﬂuctuations are small.

are small. In other words, the length of the day is assumed to be short compared to the characteristic thermal response time of the planet’s surface, a concept which will be explored quantitatively in Section 8.3. Consider a small strip of the planet’s surface near a latitude φ, of angular width dφ. Ifais the planet’s radius, then the area of this strip is 2 πa2cos(φ)dφ, if angles are measured in radians. The cross section area of the strip seen edge-on looking from the Sun determines the amount of solar ﬂux intercepted by the strip. This area is 2 a2cos2(φ)dφwhen dφis small. In consequence, the incident solar radiation per unit area at latitude φisLcos(φ)/π. At the Equator, the solar radiation per unit area is L/π, which is somewhat greater than the value L/4 which we obtained in Chapter 3 by averaging solar radiation over the entire surface of the planet. If the planet has no atmosphere to transport heat or create a greenhouse eﬀect, the equilibrium temperature as a function of latitude is T= (Lcos(φ) πσ)1 4 (8.3) The temperature has its maximum at the Equator, and falls to zero at the poles. Exercise 8.2.1 For the geometric situation described above, derive an expression for the cosine of the zenith angle as a function of latitude and longitude. Re-derive the expression for the daily- average distribution of solar absorption by averaging the cosine of the zenith angle along latitude circles. Now we turn to the general case, in which the axis of rotation of the planet is not per- pendicular to the plane containing the orbit. The angle between the perpendicular to the orbital plane, and the planet’s axis of rotation, is known as the obliquity , and we shall call it γ.

it γ. It can be regarded as constant over the course of a planet’s year, though there are longer term variations which will be of interest to us later. The task now is to determine the solar zenith angle as a function of latitude, position along the latitude circle, and time of year.8.2. DISTRIBUTION OF INCIDENT SOLAR RADIATION 97 Let the point Pbe the center of the planet, and Sbe the center of the sun. If we draw a line from PtoS, it will intersect the surface of the planet at a latitude δ, which is called the latitude of the sun , or sometimes the subsolar latitude . It is a function of the orientation of the planet’s axis alone, and serves as a characterization of where we are in the march of the seasons. If the obliquity of the planet is γ, then δranges from γat the Northern Hemisphere summer solstice to −γat the Southern Hemisphere summer solstice. Let Qbe a point on the planet’s surface, characterized by its latitude φand its ”hour angle” h, which is the longitude relative to the longitude at which local noon (the highest sun position) is occurring throughout the globe. For radiative purposes, we just need to compute the zenith angle ζ, deﬁned previously. To get the zenith angle, we only need to take the vector dot product of the vector /vectorQSand the vector /vectorPQ. To do this, it is convenient to introduce a local Cartesian coordinate system centered at P, with the z-axis coincident with the axis of rotation, the x-axis lying in the plane containing the rotation axis and /vectorPS, and the y-axis orthogonal to the other two, chosen to complete a right-handed coordinate system. First, note that by the deﬁnition of the dot product, cos(ζ) =/vectorPQ·/vectorQS |PQ||QS|(8.4) Further, /vectorPQ+/vectorQS=/vectorPS, so cos(ζ) =/vectorPQ·/vectorPQ |PQ||QS|+/vectorPQ·/vectorPS |PQ||QS|≈/vectorPQ·/vectorPS |PQ||QS|(8.5) where we drop the ﬁrst term based on the assumption that the radius of the planet is a small fraction of its distance from the Sun.

the Sun. For the same reason, |QS|in the denominator can with good approximation be replaced by |PS|, leaving the expression in the form of a dot product between two unit vectors. Letting ˆ n1=/vectorPQ/|PQ|and ˆn2=/vectorPS/|PS|, the unit vectors have the following components in the local Cartesian coordinate system. ˆn1= (cos( φ) cos( h),cos(φ) sin( h),sin(φ)),ˆn2= (cos( δ),0,sin(δ)) (8.6) whence cos(ζ) = cos( φ) cos( δ) cos( h) + sin( φ) sin( δ) (8.7) When cos ζ <0 the sun is below the horizon. The cosine of the zenith angle attains a maximum value cos( φ−δ) when h= 0, and a minimum value −cos(φ+δ) when h=±π. Both values are above the horizon when |φ|> |π/2−δ|, corresponding to the perpetual polar summer day. Both values are below the horizon when|φ|>|π/2 +δ|, corresponding to the perpetual polar winter night. At the solstices, δtakes on its extreme values of ±γ. Therefore, perpetual day or night are experienced at some time of year for latitudes poleward of π/2−γ. These circles are known as the Arctic andAntarctic circles on Earth. Apart from the case of perpetual day or night, there is a terminator which separates the illuminated from the dark side of the planet. The position of the terminator is given by cosht=−tan(φ) tan( δ) (8.8) If Ω is the angular velocity of rotation of the planet, so that the planet’s day is Tday= 2π/Ω time units, then the number of time units of daylight is 2 ht/Ω = ( ht/π)Tday.

( ht/π)Tday. We shall adopt the convention ht= 0 in the case of perpetual night, and ht=±π/2 for perpetual day.98 CHAPTER 8. VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE WITH SEASON AND LATITUDE Exercise 8.2.2 For a given latitude φ, what δyields the least hours of daylight? What δyields the most hours of daylight? The Earth’s present obliquity is 23.5 degrees, and it’s length of day is 23.94hours. Sketch a plot of the maximum and minimum hours of daylight vs. latitude for the Earth. The diurnal variations of the zenith angle lead to hot days and cold nights. Where the thermal response time is long enough to average out an appreciable portion of the diurnal temper- ature variation, the daily mean incident solar ﬂux is an informative statistic. Since the incident solar ﬂux per square meter of surface is Lcosζ, where Lis the solar constant in W/m2, one can obtain the daily mean ﬂux by averaging cos ζover a rotation period of the planet. This results in a nondimensional ﬂux factor f, by which one multiplies the solar constant in order to obtain the daily mean solar radiation incident on each square meter of the planet’s spherical surface. The daily average can be performed analytically, resulting in f(φ, δ) =1 2π/integraldisplayht −htcos(ζ)dh =1 π[cos(φ) cos( δ) sin( ht) + sin( φ) sin( δ)ht](8.9) where htis determined by Eq. 8.8. This derivation of the daily average assumes that the length of the day is much less than the length of the year, so that δmay be regarded as constant over the course of the day.

the day. If the length of the day is a signiﬁcant fraction of the length of the year, as is be the case for nearly tide-locked planets like Mercury or Venus, the expression still gives the correct average along the latitude circle, but this average is no longer identical to the time average over a day. During the equinoxes, δ= 0 and f= cos( φ)/π, independant of the obliquity. This agrees with the result we obtained earlier by direct geometrical reasoning. At other times of year, the daily mean ﬂux is governed by two competing factors: the varying length of day, which tends to produce higher ﬂuxes near the summer pole, and the average zenith angle, which tends to produce high ﬂuxes near the subsolar latitude (which remains near the Equator if the obliquity is not too large). The latitude where the maximum daily mean insolation occurs is always between the subsolar latitude δand the summer pole. For δ= 0 the maximum occurs at the Equator, and a little numerical experimentation shows that the latitude of the maximum increases to about 43 .4o when δ= 23.4o(and similarly, with reversal of signs, in the Southern hemisphere). For larger δ, the length-of-day eﬀect wins out over the slant angle eﬀect at the pole, and the maximum occurs at the summer pole itself. This state of aﬀairs just barely happens at the solstice for the present obliquity of Earth and Mars; as a result, the summer hemisphere solstice insolation is fairly uniform in these two cases. It is also useful to note that the daily mean insolation at the summer pole exceeds the daily mean insolation at the Equator when |δ|>17.86o. To obtain a general appreciation of the seasonal cycle, recall that δvaries from −γduring the southern hemisphere summer solstice to γat the northern hemisphere summer solstice, taking on a value of zero at the equinox which lies between the two solstices.

two solstices. Consider a planet with uniform albedo, so that the absorbed solar radiation is determined by the distribution of incident solar radiation. Suppose further that the thermal response time is long enough to average out the diurnal cycle, but short compared to the length of the year. If the obliquity is below 23 .4o, the ”hot spot” starts some distance poleward of the Equator in the Southern hemisphere, moves to the Equator as the equinox is approached, and then migrates a similar distance into the Northern hemisphere as the Northern summer solstice is aproached. If the obliquity is greater than 23 .4o, the hot spot starts at the South Pole, discontinously jumps to −43.4oat the point in the season8.2. DISTRIBUTION OF INCIDENT SOLAR RADIATION 99 κκ κκ S NH Summer NH Winter Fall Spring Figure 8.4: where the subsolar latitude crosses −23.4o, smoothly migrates throught the Equator and on to 43.4owhen the subsolar latitude approaches 23 .4o, and then discontinuously jumps to the North Pole. Note that in either case, the hot spot crosses the Equator twice per year, at the equinoxes; the two solstices are the coldest times at the Equator. The climate at the Equator has a periodicity that is halfthe planet’s year. It only remains to express δas a function of the position of the planet in its orbit. The planet is spinning like a top, and if there are no torques acting on the planet (an assumption we will relax later) its angular momentum is conserved. Hence the rotation axis keeps a ﬁxed orientation relative to the distant stars throughout the year. This is why Polaris is the Northern Hemisphere pole star all year around. Let κbe the angle describing the position of the planet, as shown in Figure 8.4.

Figure 8.4. We shall adopt the convention that κ= 0 occurs at the Northern Hemisphere summer solstice. We shall refer to κas the season angle , but it is more commonly (and more obscurely) referred to as the longitude of the sun . In our case, we have deﬁned the longitude of the sun relative to the Northern Hemisphere summer solstice, but other choices are also common, for example deﬁning it relative to the Northern winter solstice or the Spring equinox. When discussing the progression through the seasonal cycle on planets other than Earth, the season angle is almost universally used to describe where the planet is in its cycle, since this description obviates the need to make up names for months for each planet. If we project the rotation axis onto the plane of the ecliptic (i.e. the plane containing the planet’s orbit), then the angle made by this vector with /vectorPSis equal to κ. The rotation axis projected onto the plane of the ecliptic acts like the hand of a clock, which rotates around the clock face once per year, though at a non-uniform rate if the orbit is not perfectly circular. Let ˆnbe the unit normal vector to the plane of the ecliptic, and ˆ nabe the unit vector in the direction of the rotation axis. Introduce a new cartesian coordinate system with xpointing along /vectorPS,zpointing along ˆ n, and yperpendicular to the two in a right-handed way. Then ˆna= (cos( κ) sin( γ),sin(κ) sin( γ),cos(γ)) and the latitude of the sun is the complement of the angle between ˆ naand the xaxis, whence sin(δ) = cos(π 2−δ) = cos( κ) sin( γ) (8.10) In the limit of small obliquity, this equation reduces to δ=γcosκ(t).

to δ=γcosκ(t). For a circular orbit, κ(t) = Ω t,100 CHAPTER 8. VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE WITH SEASON AND LATITUDE where Ω is the orbital angular velocity (2 πdivided by the orbital period). In this special case, the subsolar latitude varies cosinusoidally over the year, with amplitude given by the obliquity. This is actually not a bad approximation even for the roughly 23ocurrent obliquity of Earth and Mars, agreeing with the true value to two decimal places. At the opposite extreme, when γ= 90o, the subsolar latitude is given by δ=π/2−κ, which is not at all sinusoidal. Exercise 8.2.3 Compute the length of day as a function of the time of year for the latitude at which you are currently located. Compare with data for the current day, either observed yourself or presented in the newspaper weather report. Compute the length of a shadow that would be cast by a tall, thin skyscraper of height 100m, as a function of the time of day and time of year at your latitude. Contour plots of the ﬂux factor for various obliquities are shown in Figure 8.5. These plots assume the orbit to be perfectly circular, so that there is no variation in distance from the Sun in the course of the year. Over the course of the year, the hot spot moves from south of the Equator to North of the Equator, and back again, passing over the Equator at the equinoxes. The amplitude of the excursion increases with obliquity, and goes all the way from pole to pole for suﬃciently large obliquity. Earth, Mars, Saturn,Titan, and Neptune with present-day obliquities of 23 .5o, 24o,26.7o,26.7o,and 29 .6orespectively, are qualitatively like the 20ocase.

the 20ocase. The pattern of variation of incident solar radiation which forces the seasonal cycle is similar in all these cases. However, the nature of the seasonal cycle will diﬀer amongst these planets because the diﬀering nature of the atmospheres and planetary surfaces will lead to diﬀerent thermal response times. In the case of gas giant planets, another variable is the proportion of energy received from solar energy vs. the that received by transport from the interior of the planet. Insofar as the latter becomes dominant, the role of solar heating, and hence the prominence of the seasonal cycle, becomes less. Jupiter has a low obliquity (3 .1o), which, compounded by a high proportion of internal heating (** per cent) should lead to a minimal seasonal cycle. At the opposite extreme is Uranus, which has an obliquity of nearly 90o, and a small proportion (about ** percent) of internal heating. Venus is so slowly rotating that its obliquity is of little interest. Obliquity is not constant in time; it varies gradually over many thousands of years. We will see in Section 8.5.1 that relatively slight variations in the Earth’s obliquity are believed to contribute to the coming and going of the ice ages. The obliquity of Mars varies more dramatically, and perhaps with greater consequence; at various times in the past it could have reached values as high as 50oand as low as 15o. If the thermal response time of the planet is a year or more, then a considerable part of the seasonal cycle is averaged out and the annual mean insolation becomes an informative statistic. It will be seen in the next section that this is the case for watery planets like the Earth. The annual mean ﬂux factor is shown in Figure 8.6. When obliquity is small, the poles receive hardly any radiation. As obliquity is increased, the polar regions receive more insolation, at the expense of the equatorial regions.

equatorial regions. For Earthlike obliquity, the maximum insolation occurs at the Equator, which is why this region of Earth’s surface tends to be warmest. When the obliquity exceeds 53 .9o, the annual mean polar insolation becomes greater than the annual mean equatorial insolation. For such a planet, the poles will be warmer than the tropics, provided that the thermal response time is long enough to average out most of the seasonal cycle. Consider a planet with 20o obliquity, zero albedo, and a very long thermal response time. If the planet were put in Earth’s orbit about the Sun, the Solar constant would be 1370 W/m2, yielding equatorial insolation of 422W/m2and polar insolation of 149 W/m2, based on the ﬂux factors given in Figure 8.6. In the absence of any greenhouse eﬀect or lateral energy transport by atmospheres or oceans, the equatorial temperature would be 294K and the polar temperature would be 226K. If one takes into account the clear-sky greenhouse eﬀect of an Earthlike atmosphere with 300ppm CO2and 50%8.2.

In these plots, a circular orbit has been assumed. To obtain the daily mean energy ﬂux incident on each square meter of the planet’s surface, one multiplies the ﬂux factor by the solar constant. For example, if the solar constant is 1000 W/m2, the incident solar ﬂux at the pole during the Summer solstice is about 700 W/m2if the obliquity is 45o.102 CHAPTER 8.

Lowering the relative humidity to 20% to reﬂect the fact that much of the tropical troposphere is very dry (recall Chapter ? ?) still leaves the tropics with temperatures in excess of 350K. Part of the problem lies in the neglect of albedo. Simply using the observed planetary albedo in the tropics gives the wrong answer, because almost all of the cloud albedo is oﬀset by the cloud greenhouse eﬀect in the present climate (Chapter ? ?). Using an albedo of .15, based on the observed tropical clear-sky albedo, reduces the equatorial solar absorption to 360 W/m2, which is in balance with a tropical temperature of 318K assuming a relative humidity of 20%. This is still well in excess of the observed tropical temperature. In the real atmosphere, heat transports due to large scale atmospheric and oceanic motions remove some of the heat from the tropics and deposit it at high latitudes, reducing the tropical temperatures and increasing the polar temperatures. Since incorporation of ice-albedo eﬀects would reduce the polar temperatures below the estimates given above, such transports are also needed to bring the polar temperatures up into the observed range.

observed range. Some elementary models of heat transport will be discussed in Chapter 10, though a proper treatment of the subject must be deferred until Volume II, where the necessary ﬂuid dynamical background will be developed. If we put the same planet at the orbit of Mars the temperatures become 238K and 183K with- out any greenhouse eﬀect. Since there is little water vapor feedback at such low temperatures, the greenhouse eﬀect is less dramatic in this case. Addition of an Earthlike atmosphere with 300ppmv CO2would increase the equatorial and polar temperatures to 256K and 192K, respectively, based on a linear OLR ﬁt in the range 200K to 250K (speciﬁcally, OLR = 80.6 + 1.83(T−200)). Thus, a waterworld placed at the orbit of Mars would require a much stronger greenhouse eﬀect than the Earth’s to avoid succumbing to a snowball state. The eﬀects of obliquity on the seasonal and latitudinal pattern of insolation may be summed up as follows. Increasing obliquity increases the intensity of the seasonal cycle at mid to high8.2. DISTRIBUTION OF INCIDENT SOLAR RADIATION 103 Figure 8.7: Schematic eﬀect of atmospheric scattering on insolation latitudes. The summer insolation gets steadily higher relative to the global mean, and a greater area of the winter hemisphere exposed to cold perpetual night or low insolation. Increasing obliquity also increases the annual mean polar insolation, though the way this aﬀects polar climate depends on the thermal response time of the atmosphere-surface system. The increase might show up as very hot summers and bitterly cold winters, or as year-round warming, accordingly as the response time is fast or slow. The preceding results on incident solar radiation have been derived in the absence of an atmosphere, but can still be used if there is in intervening atmosphere which may absorb or scatter solar radiation before it reaches the surface.

the surface. The general geometry is illustrated in Figure 8.7. In this case, one suspends an imaginary sphere at an altitude above which the atmosphere is too thin to have a signﬁcant eﬀect on the solar radiation. The preceding results then give the solar ﬂux entering each square meter of the surface of this sphere, and the angle at which the light enters the atmosphere. This is all that is needed as input to one-dimensional scattering models of the sort discussed in Chapter 5. One simply divides up the atmosphere into a series of patches near each latitude and longitude point, within which the properties are considered uniform, and applies a one-dimensional column model to each of these patches. As illustrated in 8.7, if the horizontal size of the patches is large compared to the depth of the atmosphere, the energy loss by horizontal scattering from one patch to another can be neglected, and each patch can be considered energetically closed, so far as radiation is concerned. The atmosphere has three eﬀects, which can be inferred from the column radiation model: (1) Some of the incident solar radiation reaches the surface in the form of diﬀuse radiation at a continuous distribution of angles, rather than at the zenith angle, (2) Some of the solar radiation is absorbed in the atmosphere, rather than at the surface, and (3) some of the incident solar radiation is reﬂected back to space instead of entering the climate system. Of the three eﬀects, it is the last – the eﬀect of the atmosphere, including its clouds, on planetary albedo – that is most important for determining the climate. Diﬀuse radiation and atmospheric absorption do not change the amount of energy entering a column, but only the place and angle with which it enters. Often, this is of little consequence, so one can get a good estimate of the planet’s temperature if one can obtain an estimate of the planetary albedo from one means or another.

or another. The above reasoning can even to some extent apply to gas giant planets which have no surface. One can still deﬁne the imaginary sphere through which radiation enters the system, as before, but the problem comes in deﬁning a characteristic depth scale. For the purposes of solar radiation, it suﬃces to consider the depth of atmosphere over which most of the solar radiation is absorbed, in eﬀect a ”photic” zone. This is typically shallow compared to the prodigious size of the gas giants. The full problem, including internal heat sources and dynamical motions, might require consideration of a deeper layer. Whatever the depth of this ”active layer,” the preceding reasoning applies provided one can sensibly model the large scale aspects of the climate on the basis of averaging over patches of horizontal extent that is large compared to the characteristic depth scale. For giant planets, as for the Earth or any other planet, the essential diﬃculty is that clouds, temperature, water vapor and other climate variables are manifestly not uniform over104 CHAPTER 8. VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE WITH SEASON AND LATITUDE length scales comparable to or longer than the depth of the atmosphere. One makes progress by boldly assuming that one can represent the eﬀects of these ﬂuctuating quantities by their large scale averages. It is an assumption that is diﬃcult or impossible to justify mathematically, and in some cases may not even be true. With the present state of the art, one can only make progress by proceeding on the basis of the averaging assumption, and seeing how things work out. 8.3 Thermal Inertia At several points in the preceding discussion, we have needed to make reference to the thermal response time of the system. In the present section, we shall make this notion precise. The heat storage in the planet’s solid or liquid surface, and in its atmosphere means that it takes time for the system to heat up or cool down.

cool down. The strength of this eﬀect, known as thermal inertia , determines the extent to which the seasonal and diurnal ﬂuctuations are averaged out in the climate response. 8.3.1 Thermal inertia for a mixed-layer ocean The concept of thermal inertia is well illustrated by consideration of heat storage in the mixed layer of an ocean. Consider a layer of incompressible ﬂuid with density ρand speciﬁc heat cp, which is well-mixed by turbulence to a depth H. The assumption of well-mixedness implies that any heating or cooling applied to the surface is distributed instantaneously throughout the depth of the mixed layer, whose temperature thus remains uniform. Let S(t) be the solar ﬂux heating the mixed layer, and assume that the cooling of the mixed layer (by infrared radiation or other means) can be written as a function of temperature, which we shall call F(T). For example, if the atmosphere above the ocean has no greenhouse eﬀect and carries no heat away from the surface by turbulent transport, the cooling is the radiative cooling F(T) =σT4. The energy balance equation for the mixed layer is then d dtρcpHT=S(t)−F(T) (8.11) Exercise 8.3.1 Consider a planet with a 50m deep mixed layer water ocean ( cp= 4218 J/kg,ρ= 1000kg/m3). Suppose that the atmosphere for some reason has no eﬀect whatsoever on the surface energy budget. (Why would this situation be hard to arrange, even for a pure N2atmosphere?) Hence F(T) =σT4. Suppose that the temperature of the polar ocean is 300Kwhen the sun sets and the long polar night begins. Find a solution to Eq. 8.11 for this situation, and use it to determine how long it takes for the ocean to fall to the freezing point (about 271K for salt water)?

salt water)? We may deﬁne a thermal inertia coeﬃcient µ=ρcpHfor the mixed layer ocean. If an amount of energy ∆ Eis added to or removed from the system, the corresponding temperature change is ∆ E/µ. For a 50m mixed layer water ocean, µ= 2.1·108J/m2, so that an energy ﬂux of 100W/m2out of the surface would lead to a cooling rate of 100 /µ= 4.74·10−7K/s =.04K/day . Clearly, a rather shallow layer of well-mixed water can buﬀer a considerable surface ﬂux imbalance. The Earth’s ocean is several kilometers deep, but it is only the upper few tens of meters that are well mixed on short time scales; 50m is in fact a reasonable approximation to the overall mixed layer depth of Earth’s ocean, though there are geographical variations. Most other liquids would do about as well as water at storing heat. It is primarily the mixing depth that determines the thermal buﬀering eﬀect of a planet’s ocean.8.3. THERMAL INERTIA 105 Atmospheres also have thermal inertia, which can be considered in a fashion analogous to a mixed layer. The entire mass of the troposphere is well-mixed, and this generally makes up most of the mass of an atmosphere. In that case, the energy per square meter needed to raise the temperature of an atmosphere by 1K is µ=cpps/g, where psis the surface pressure, gthe acceleration of gravity and cpthe mean speciﬁc heat of the gas making up the atmosphere. It is convenient to express this value in terms of the depth of a water mixed layer ocean, Heqwhich would have the same thermal inertia coeﬃcient.

inertia coeﬃcient. For the Earth atmosphere, Heq= 2.4m, which is insigniﬁcant in comparison to the mixed layer depth of the ocean. Hence, one expects the Earth’s atmosphere to come into equilibrium much more quickly than the ocean. The current 6mb CO2atmosphere of Mars has Heq=.03m, while the massive atmosphere of Venus has Heqin excess of 155 m. Neither Mars nor Venus has an ocean to buﬀer the seasonal cycle, but the Venus atmosphere alone can be expected to have a considerable moderating eﬀect, whereas present Mars should behave more or less as if each point of the globe is in instantaneous equilibrium. Early Mars (circa 4 billion years ago) may have had a 2 bar CO2atmosphere, which would translate into a 10 mequivalent mixed layer. This is considerably greater than that of Earth’s atmosphere, but still not enough to have much moderating eﬀect, in view of the fact that Mars’ year is about twice as long as Earth’s. Titan has a mostly N2atmosphere with a surface pressure only slightly in excess of Earth, but it’s weak gravitational acceleration of 1 .35m/s2means that this pressure translates into a much greater mass of atmosphere per square meter of planetary surface. Thus,the Titan atmosphere has an equivalent mixed layer depth of about 24 m. Given the low temperature of Titan, and consequent low rate of energy loss by infrared emission, this value is expected to yield a very considerable buﬀering eﬀect on Titan’s seasonal cycle, regardless of whether there is a liquid ocean at the surface. For example, based on a typical surface temperature of 90K, blackbody emission would cool the planet only at a rate of about 1K per 300 Earth days, if insolation were completely shut oﬀ.

shut oﬀ. Exercise 8.3.2 The speciﬁc heat of liquid Methane is 3450.J/K. How deep would a well-mixed methane ocean on Titan have to be for it to have thermal inertia comparable to Titan’s atmosphere? We shall now consider some simple solutions to the mixed layer model, keeping in mind that this model applies to atmospheres as well as oceans, with a suitable choice of the equivalent mixed layer depth. At this point we assume that ρcpHis constant, though models with a time-varying mixed layer depth are possible. Without any loss of generality we may write the insolation and temperature in the form S=So+S/prime(t), T=To+T/prime(t) (8.12) where SoandToare the time means of SandTand the deviations have zero time mean. Now, suppose that T/prime<< T ofor whatever reason; this need not require that S/prime<< S o, since the temperature ﬂuctuations might be small by virtue of a slow response time of the system. Be- cause the temperature ﬂuctuations are small, the surface cooling can be expanded about Toand approximated by a linear function: F(T) =F(To) +aT/prime(t), b=dF dT(To) (8.13) Now we choose Toto be the equilibrium temperature corresponding to the mean insolation So, i.e. F(To) =So. With these assumptions the equation for the temperature ﬂuctuation becomes dT/prime dt=1 ρcpH(S/prime(t)−bT/prime) (8.14)106 CHAPTER 8. VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE WITH SEASON AND LATITUDE or equivalently, if we deﬁne the relaxation time τ= (ρcpH)/b, dT/prime dt+T/prime τ=1 ρcpHS/prime(t) (8.15) We can distinguish two limiting cases for Equation 8.15.

Equation 8.15. When the time scale over which S/primevaries is slow compared to τ, then the ﬁrst term on the left hand side is negligable compared to the second, whence the solution becomes T/prime=τS/prime(t)/(ρcpH) =S/prime(t)/a. In other words, the system acts as if it’s in equilibrium with the instantaneous solar radiation at each time. In the opposite limit, the time scale of the solar ﬂuctuation is rapid compared to τ, in which case it is the second term on the left hand side that may be neglected. Thus, T/prime(t) =1 ρcpH/integraldisplayt 0S/prime(t/prime)dt/prime(8.16) In this case, the temperature is out of phase with the heating, and represents a time average of the ﬂuctuating heating. The peak temperature occurs later than the peak solar heating, since it takes time for the mixed layer to respond to the accumulating heating. Further, in this case, the seasonal temperature ﬂuctuation becomes small as the mixed layer depth is made large, since the mixed layer becomes more and more eﬃcient at averaging out the seasonal ﬂuctuations of solar ﬂux. The variations in solar radiation over the course of a year are not sinusoidal, but we can nonetheless gain some further insight into the seasonal cycle by writing S/prime=S1cos(ωt). For this form of forcing, Eq. 8.15 can be solved most easily by using complex exponentials. Since S/prime=S1Real(exp(−iωt)), the solution may be written T/prime=Real(Aexp(−iωt)). Substituting this form of solution into Eq. 8.15 we ﬁnd A=S1 ρcpH1/τ+iω 1/τ2+ω2=|A|ei∆(8.17) where the phase and amplitude are ∆ = arctan( ωτ),|A|=S1 ρcpH1/radicalbig (1/τ2+ω2)(8.18) With these deﬁnitions, the solution can be written T/prime(t) =|A|cos(ωt−∆) (8.19) The character of the response depends on the period of the forcing relative to the characteristic response time of the system.

the system. This determines both the amplitude of the ﬂuctuation and the phase shift relative to the forcing. For ωτ << 1 we have ∆ = 0 and |A|=S1/a. For ωτ >> 1 we have ∆ = π/2 and|A|=S1/(ρcpHω). Note that in this case the temperature ﬂuctuation becomes weak in inverse proportion to the frequency of the solar forcing ﬂuctuation. These are special cases of the limits discussed previously, but we now have the further advantage of an explicit formula showing how the phase and amplitude of the seasonal cycle vary between the two extreme cases. So far, we have not speciﬁed the ﬂux which is to be used for the heat loss term F(T) in Eq. 8.11, or for the damping coeﬃcient bin the linearized form of the equation. One candidate for this ﬂux is the top-of-atmosphere infrared heat loss. The other is the combined turbulent and infrared heat exchange between the planetary surface and the atmosphere, discussed in Chapter There are two circumstances in which the top-of-atmosphere ﬂux (the OLR) is the appropriate8.3. THERMAL INERTIA 107 one to use. If the time scale under consideration is long enough that the surface budget can come into equilibrium, then the net solar ﬂux absorbed at the surface is equal to the net turbulent and infrared ﬂux passing from the surface into the atmosphere. In this case, we may consider the energy budget of the surface-atmosphere system as a whole, whence the OLR gives the heat loss from the system. The thermal inertia is provided by the atmosphere, and one uses he atmosphere’s equivalent mixed layer depth in the mixed layer model equations. Alternately, if the response time of the atmosphere is short enough compared to the time scale under consideration, the energy budget of the atmosphere comes into equilibrium.

into equilibrium. In this case, the net energy exchange between the surface and the atmosphere must equal the OLR, since otherwise the atmosphere would warm up or cool down until equilibrium is achieved. Hence, one can use the OLR for the heat loss term in the surface energy budget, obviating the need to know the detailed physics behind the surface to atmosphere energy transfer. In this case, the thermal inertia is provided by the heat capacity of the mixed layer ocean. In either case, one can compute OLR (T) using a radiation model and some assumption linking the temperature and humidity proﬁle to surface temperature, or one can use one of the linear or polynomial ﬁts to the OLR curve discussed in Section 4. For example, with a linear ﬁt to the OLR curve for a terrestrial atmosphere with 300ppmv CO2and 50% relative humidity, b is about 2( W/m2)/Kin the range 250K to 310K. The corresponding relaxation time τis 1200 days for a 50 meter mixed layer, or 60 days for the 2.4m mixed layer which is equivalent to the thermal inertia of the Earth’s atmosphere. In consequence, the seasonal cycle is expected to be strongly attenuated on the ocean- covered parts of the Earth (apart from coastal eﬀects). The atmosphere alone does not have enough thermal inertia to damp out the seasonal cycle, but it does have enough thermal inertia to keep the atmospheric temperature roughly constant in the course of the diurnal cycle. Colder temperatures tend to make the relaxation time longer. For example, in an Earthlike atmosphere with 300ppm CO2, the relaxation time roughly doubles at 160K. As noted earlier, Titan has a very long relaxation time owing to its thick atmosphere and low temperature; now we can make the statement more precise. Ignoring the greenhouse eﬀect and setting b= 4σT3, T= 90Kwe ﬁnd a relaxation time of 20 Earth years, based on the equivalent 24m mixed layer depth of Titan’s atmosphere.

Titan’s atmosphere. Since Titan’s year (which is the same as Saturn’s year) is about 30 Earth years, the seasonal cycle on Titan is expected to be considerably damped, though not so much so as the seasonal cycle over the Earth’s oceans. The weak greenhouse eﬀect from methane in Titan’s atmosphere would somewhat enhance the damping. In contrast, a similar calculation for the thin atmosphere of present Mars gives a relaxation time of only .8 Earth days, based on T= 200 K. Since a Mars day is approximately the same as an Earth day, the thermal inertia of the Martian atmosphere at present has relatively little damping eﬀecton the diurnal cycle. The thermal relaxation process is diﬀerent if the time scale under consideration is short compared to the response time of the atmosphere, but long compared to the response time of the surface. In this case, the atmospheric temperature remains approximately constant while the surface temperature ﬂuctuates. This is the way the diurnal cycle works on Earth over ice or land. The relaxation time of surface temperature is then determined using the turbulent and radiative surface-atmosphere ﬂux formulae discussed in Chapter 6, rather than the OLR. The situation of present Mars is not like this, since the atmosphere has little thermal inertia. There, the diurnal cycle aﬀects the entire depth of the atmosphere, and the diurnal response is approximately governed by the OLR and the thermal inertia of the surface, much as for the Earth’s seasonal cycle. In the general case, where neither the atmosphere nor the ocean are in equilibrium, one must write a separate mixed layer model for each of these two components, coupling them through the surface exchange ﬂux formulae, and allowing the atmosphere to lose energy through it’s top108 CHAPTER 8. VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE WITH SEASON AND LATITUDE via OLR.

via OLR. The exploration of this case will be left to the reader. 8.3.2 Thermal inertia of a solid surface Heat diﬀuses slowly through a non-metallic solid, so when the underlying surface is solid it is typically necessary to consider the continous distribution of temperature as a function of depth within the solid. To a good approximation, heat ﬂux within a solid is proportional to the temper- ature gradient; the proportionality constant is called the thermal conductivity , which we shall call κT. Balancing the rate of change of heat content against the convergence of heat ﬂux yields the diﬀusion equation ∂tρcpT=∂zκT∂zT (8.20) In this equation it is assumed that there are no internal heat sources. The surface heat budget enters the problem through the boundary condition at the surface ( z= 0), which states that the diﬀusive heat ﬂux into the surface equals the net heating of the surface by insolation and radiative and turbulent heat transfers. Using the same notation as we employed for the mixed layer case, this boundary condition reads κT∂zT|z=0=S(t)−F(T) (8.21) When Sis a constant So, the problem is solved with a constant temperature Tosatisfying So= F(To), just as for the mixed layer case. Linearizing the boundary condition about Toand substi- tuting the complex exponential form for S/primeyields κT∂zT/prime|z=0=S1e−iωt−bT/prime(8.22) Ifρcpis constant, this boundary condition can be satisﬁed by a solution of the diﬀusion equation of the form T/prime=Aei(kz−ωt), k=/radicalbiggω D1−i√ 2(8.23) where Ais a constant and Dis the diﬀusivity κT/(ρcp).

diﬀusivity κT/(ρcp). The complex vertical wavenumber khas been determined by substitution of the exponential form of T/primeinto the diﬀusion equation. Awill be determined by substitution of the solution into the boundary condition, but before doing so it is worth pausing to make some remarks on the solution Eq. 8.23. This solution was ﬁrst obtained by Fourier, in his study of diurnal and seasonal variations of temperatures in the interior of the Earth. Eq. 8.23 shows that the characteristic depth to which temperature ﬂuctuations penetrate is/radicalbig (D/ω). Low frequency ﬂuctuations penetrate to a greater depth than high frequency ﬂuctuations, because heat has a longer time to diﬀuse before the surface temperature reverses. Note also that the phase lag of the time of maximum temperature with depth also reﬂects the time required for the surface conditions to penetrate to the interior. For the diﬀusivity of water ice (Table 8.1) the characteristic depth is 12 cm for the diurnal period, 2.4m for the annual period, 24m for a century and 76m for a millennium. Solid rock yields similar numbers. Hence, the temperature proﬁle within ice or rock still contains information about temperatures centuries or even millennia in the past, albeit in a rather smoothed and degraded form. This fact has been exploited in reconstructions of past temperatures. Exercise 8.3.3 You are designing a lunar colony to be placed at a Lunar latitude where the sun is directly overhead at noon. The moon has an albedo close to zero, and the response time of the surface is rapid, so that the noontime surface temperature is close to the instantaneous equilibrium temperature of 394K (re-derive this temperature yourself). At night, the equilibrium temperature would be absolute zero, but there is not enough time to reach equilibrium; still the night-time8.3.

Since the Moon is tide-locked to the Earth, the Lunar day is 28 Earth days. The diﬀusivity of the Lunar regolith (”soil”) is about 10−8m2/s. Approximate the day-night temperature variation by a sinusoidal curve. What would be the constant temperature far below the surface (neglecting internal heat sources)? How deeply would the colony habitat have to be buried in order for the ambient diurnal temperature ﬂuctuations to be less than 1K? NB: Given the low diﬀusivity of the regolith, your main diﬃculty is likely to be getting rid of the heat generated by energy use (biological and otherwise) within the colony. Now we substitute Eq. 8.23 into the boundary condition (8.22). The result is A=S1 b+ρcp√ ωD1+i√ 2 =S1 b1 1 +√ωτD1+i√ 2 =S1 ρcp/radicalbig D/ω1 1 τ1+1+i√ 2ω(8.24) where τD= (ρcp)2D/b2andτ1=ρcp/radicalbig D/ω/b .

D/ω/b . Upon comparison of the third line of this equation with the solution for the mixed layer model, it is seen that the solid case acts somewhat like a mixed layer model with frequency dependent layer depth/radicalbig D/ω. For low frequency forcing, ωτD/lessmuch1, the surface temperature follows the instantaneous equilibrium, A=S1/b, just as for the mixed layer case. For high frequency forcing, the amplitude of the surface temperature ﬂuctuation decays like 1 //radicalbig (ω). This is slower than was the case for the ﬁxed-depth mixed layer, since the layer determining the thermal inertia now gets thinner as frequency is increased. Note also that the phase lag of surface temperature relative to insolation diﬀers from the mixed layer case. For the diﬀusion equation, the surface temperature lags the insolation by π/4 radians in the high frequency limit rather than π/2. The thinning of the active thermal layer keeps the surface temperature closer to instantaneous equilibrium than it would be in the ﬁxed-depth case. Apart from some exceptional circumstances, the thermal inertia of a solid surface has little eﬀect on the seasonal cycle, though it can substantially moderate the diurnal cycle. This can be seen easily through the evaluation of tauDin a few typical cases. First we consider the case of Antarctic or Arctic ice-covered regions. The ﬂux coeﬃcient based on a linear OLR ﬁt in the temperature range 240K to 270K is b= 2.16W/(m2K). Using the heat capacity and thermal diﬀusivity for water ice, given in Table 8.1, we ﬁnd tauD= 11Earthdays . At latitudes somewhat110 CHAPTER 8. VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE WITH SEASON AND LATITUDE away from the poles, the diurnal cycle of insolation becomes signiﬁcant, particularly during the equinoxes.

the equinoxes. Since the time scale for the surface is shorter than that for the atmosphere, it would be more appropriate to use surface ﬂux coeﬃcients than OLR in analyzing the terrestrial diurnal cycle. As noted in Chapter 6, the turbulent heat transfer is strongly inhibited at night-time, when the boundary layer is statically stable. In this case, the ﬂux coeﬃcient is dominated by the radiative term 4 σT3based on surface temperature. For temperatures around 255 Kthis yields an even shorter response time τ= 4Earthdays . In the midlatitudes and Tropics, the estimate diﬀers only in the use of the slightly larger values of bappropriate to the warmer temperatures, and the somewhat diﬀerent thermal properties of rock or soil, but the result remains that τDis on the order of a few days or less. For Mars, one may use b= 4σT3based on T= 200 K, given the thin atmosphere. This yields tauD= 15Earthdays , which is still not suﬃcient to appreciably aﬀect the seasonal cycle. It is only at the extremely cold temperatures of Titan that the response time of a solid ice surface becomes signiﬁcantly longer (roughly 1300 Earth days), but even there the eﬀect is of little interest, owing to the much longer response time of Titan’s atmosphere. In sum, a solid surface can generally be considered to be in equilibrium for the purpose of computing temperature ﬂuctuations on the seasonal time scale. It should not be concluded from the above estimates that the thermal inertia of solid surfaces is suﬃcient to eliminate the diurnal cycle. The variation of insolation between noon and night- time is huge; On Earth, at a latitude where the Sun is overhead at noon, the amplitude of the variation is 1370 W/m2, which leads to an undamped temperature ﬂuctuation of 685K based on a ﬂux coeﬃcient b= 2W/(m2K).

b= 2W/(m2K). Even damped by a factor of 20, this amounts to a very considerable diurnal ﬂuctuation. Similar considerations apply to the Martian diurnal cycle. As a complement to the periodically forced solution, Figures 8.8 and 8.9 show the solutions for the diﬀusion equation in water ice which is initialized at a uniform temperature of 300K and allowed to cool without solar heating subject to a ﬂux upper boundary condition. The heat loss from the surface was computed using an Earthlike OLR ﬁt OLR (Ts) = 48 .461+1 .5866( Ts−180)+ .0029663( Ts−180)2A quadratic ﬁt was used so that the the ﬁt would remain accurate over a large temperature range. Except for the high initial temperature, which turns out to be inconsequential, this problem can be thought of as representing the cooling of the Antarctic ice cap after permanent winter night closes in. Figure 8.8 illustrates the progressive penetration of the surface cooling into the depth of the ice; at time t, the cooling has penetrated to a depth on the order of√ Dt, where Dis the thermal diﬀusivity of the ice. Figure 8.9 shows that there is an extremely rapid initial cooling, owing to the thin layer of ice aﬀected at short times. After a half day, the temperature has already fallen below freezing. Therafter, the temperature drop becomes slower, as the depth of the ice layer involved becomes greater. The reduction in OLR as temperature drop also contributes to the reduction in cooling rate. Nonetheless, after two months, the temperature has fallen to 190K, which is well below the 235K minimum temperature observed at the South Pole. Incorporation of the atmosphere’s thermal inertia reduces the cooling rate somewhat, but does much increase the extremely cold temperature encountered at the end of the winter. Clearly, the Antarctic interior relies on heat transport from warmer latitudes to limit its winter temperature drop.

temperature drop. We conclude this section with a few remarks on the special eﬀects of snow and ice (whether from water, CO2or some other substance) on the seasonal and diurnal cycle. Snow has a profound eﬀect on the diurnal cycle, because of its very low thermal conductivity, which is nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of ice (see Table 8.1 for the case of water snow). The low thermal conductivity arises from the high proportion of the snow’s volume which consists of air trapped in pores which are too small to allow the air to ﬂow; since air itself has extremely low thermal conductivity, heat must primarily make its way through the contorted pathways of snow crystals in contact with each other. Other gases, trapped in snows made of other substance, have a8.3.

THERMAL INERTIA 113 similar eﬀect. The low conductivity dramatically reduces the characteristic response time of the surface, even for a snow layer of modest thickness. In the Antarctic case discussed above, τDdrops to a mere 60 minutes for old snow, and 20 minutes for fresh snow. At night, the temperature of the snow surface plunges almost instantaneously to its equilibrium value.

equilibrium value. In the case of the Earth, the atmosphere has suﬃcient thermal inertia that it doesn’t cool much at night, above the boundary layer. Given the suppression of turbulent ﬂux in the stable nocturnal boundary layer, the night-time equilibrium temperature is maintained mainly by the downwelling infrared ﬂux from the atmosphere, as discussed in Chapter 6. When the low level air temperature is 255K, the downwelling infrared ﬂux is about 120 W/m2, maintaining a snow surface temperature of 214K. On present Mars, the atmosphere cools down markedly at night, and in any event is too thin to provide much downwelling ﬂux, so it is less obvious what limits the night-time temperature drop over the CO2snow ﬁelds that form in the winter hemisphere. One relevant consideration is that the ﬂux coeﬃcient bdrops dramatically at very cold temperatures, leading to an increase of the relaxation time; when the surface temperature falls to 150K, τDincreases to 23 hours even over snow. However, at such low temperatures the saturation vapor pressure of CO2is only 1.26mb, well below the ambient surface pressure. Hence, the night-time temperature minimum is likely to be governed by the latent heat release due to CO2condensation, which sets in at surface temperatures near 160K. Snow cover on any planet can change rapidly in the course of the seasons, and on Earth, sea ice cover similarly expands and retreats. Since snow and ice have higher albedo than the surfaces they generally cover, this has an important feedback eﬀect on the seasonal cycle. It enhances the winter-time cooling once ice or snow begin to accumulate, delays the springtime warming, but then accelerates the warming once ice or snow begin to retreat. The albedo feedback of snow is especially pronounced, since snow has a much higher albedo than ice.

than ice. For water snow, for example, the albedo of fresh snow averaged over the solar spectrum can exceed .85, whereas a typical albedo for sea ice is on the order of .6. The high albedo of snow, like its low diﬀusivity, arises from its highly porous nature which oﬀers many opportunities for light to encounter discontinuities in index of refraction, leading to scattering. It is a generic property of the snow of any weakly-absorbing substance. Note that the concept of ”sea ice” is peculiar to planets with water oceans. On a planet with a liquid methane or CO2ocean ”sea ice” would sink, and not have any chance to aﬀect the surface albedo until the ocean were frozen to the bottom. The presence of a solid phase on the surface of the planet also introduces a new form of thermal inertia, associated with the latent heat of phase change from the solid to liquid form. Where there is ice, whether it be in the form of sea ice or land glaciers, the surface temperature cannot rise above the triple point (the ”melting point”) until all the ice has been melted. The phenomenon is familiar from an experiment commonly performed in elementary school science classes, in which one tries to boil a pot of water containing ice cubes,and ﬁnds that the temperature doesn’t start to rise above freezing until all the ice is gone. As an example, let us consider the melting of a 5m thick layer of ice with an albedo of .7. Based on the latent heat of melting, it takes 1 .5·109Joules to melt a square meter of this ice layer. In summertime at the pole, the ice absorbs 160 W/m2which would then take 110 days to melt the ice layer, even if all the absorbed solar energy is retained for melting, and none is lost by radiation to the atmosphere.

the atmosphere. Thus, a modest layer of ice can persist throughout a warm season, keeping the temperature from rising. One can clearly see this principle in operation in the summertime polar temperatures of the Earth, but it also operates in midlatitude areas subject to seasonal snow cover, in eﬀect delaying the end of winter. The case of sublimation is somewhat similar, though subtler since there is no threshold temperature and the sublimated gas enters the atmosphere (with its stored energy), rather than ﬂowing away in the form of rivers or ocean currents, as is the case for the liquid produced by melting. As discussed in Chapter 6, the latent heat ﬂux due to sublimation (like evaporation) greatly increases the surface114 CHAPTER 8. VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE WITH SEASON AND LATITUDE energy loss for any given temperature. This reduces the warming of the surface required to balance the summertime increase in absorbed solar radiation. Unlike melting, it does not generally cap the surface temperature at some ﬁxed value, but it does reduce the warming below what it would be without the presence of the sublimating ice or snow. 8.3.3 Summary of thermal inertia eﬀects The preceding discussion has revealed two limiting forms of behavior a planet can exhibit in the course of its seasonal cycle. A ”waterworld,” having high thermal inertia in the ocean-atmosphere system, responds primarily to the annual average insolation. Such a world will be coldest at the poles and warmest at the equator, unless the obliquity exceeds about 54o, in which case the warmest climates will be found near the two poles. A ”desertworld,” having little thermal inertia in either the surface or the atmosphere, responds to the instantaneous insolation at each time of the year. The location of the highest temperature moves from some latitude North of the equator to the same latituded South of the equator, and back again, in the course of the year.

the year. For small obliquity, the poles are frigid throughout the year, and the hot spot executes modest excursions about the equator. For obliquities greater than about 18o, the excursion goes all the way from pole to pole, assuming a uniform albedo. Geographical and temporal albedo variations alter this picture. Formation of permanent ice or snow cover near the poles will tend to keep the polar regions cold throughout the year; this eﬀect is assisted by the thermal inertia implied by the latent heat required to melt or sublimate ice, which limits the summertime temperature increase. The Earth shows some characteristics of both limiting cases, with extreme continental climates and equable maritime climates. Thermal inertia suﬃcient to moderate the seasonal cycle can be provided either by a thick atmosphere or a well mixed liquid layer at the surface, which need only have a depth of some tens of meters. Heat storage provided by non-melting solid surfaces is almost never suﬃcient to have a signiﬁcant aﬀect on the seasonal cycle, though it can substantially moderate the diurnal cycle for planets with rotation periods on the order of a few Earth days or less. 8.4 Some elementary orbital mechanics Sir Isaac Newton showed that the orbit of a single planet revolving about its star takes the form of an ellipse, with a focus of the ellipse at the center of mass of the system. Since stars are typically much more massive than their planets, the center of mass for most purposes is identical to the center of the star. The elliptical nature of orbits has an important eﬀect on the seasonal cycle, since the planet is farther from its sun at some parts of the year than it is at others. This makes the solar ”constant” La function of time of year. On Earth, we don’t notice this eﬀect too much because our orbit is nearly circular.

nearly circular. Nonetheless, the eﬀect has an important inﬂuence on the long-term evolution of climate. On other planets, it can be even more important. The distance of closest aproach of a planet to its star is called the perihelion , which we shall callrp. The greatest distance is called the aphelion , which we shall call rap, The semi-major axis is then a= (rp+rap)/2. Let κ1be the angle made by the line between the star and the planet, deﬁned so that κ1= 0 at the perihelion. Then, in polar coordinates, the equation of the elliptical orbit is r=a1−e2 1 +ecos(κ1)(8.25) where eis the eccentricity of the orbit, which lies in the interval [0 ,1].e= 0 yields a circular orbit, while the ellipse becomes progressively more elongated as e→1. Speciﬁcally, perihelion is (1 −e)a,8.4.

To get the semi-minor axis, we maximize r(κ1)sin(κ1), yielding a√ 1−e2. Hence, the ratio of the minor to major axis is√ 1−e2. The geometry of the orbit is summarized in Figure 8.10. Exercise 8.4.1 What eccentricity would yield an ellipse with a 3:1 axis ratio?

axis ratio? Sketch such an ellipse, indicating the correct location of the Sun relative to the orbit. The variation of the solar constant is then given by L=1 4πIo r2(8.26) where Iois the power output of the star (e.g about 3 .8x1026Watts for the Sun at present). The annual variation in distance from the Sun leads to ”distance seasons,” which are synchronous between the hemispheres. This contrasts with the ”obliquity seasons” (dominant for Earth and Mars) which are out of phase between the hemispheres, one hemisphere enjoying winter while the other suﬀers under the torrid heat of summer. In the limit of small eccentricity, the ratio of solar constant at aphelion to that at perihelion is 1 + 4 e. This represents a very considerable variation, even for modest eccentricity. For the present eccentricity of the Earth (.017), it amounts to 6.8%, or 93 W/m2diﬀerence in the solar constant between perihelion and aphelion. To turn this ﬂux into a crude temperature estimate, we divide 4 to account for the averaging over the Earth’s surface, and apply a typical terrestrial OLR (T) slope of 2 W/(m2K), yielding a temperature diﬀerence of more than 11K between perihelion and aphelion. This represents the amplitude of the distance seasons. For Mars, with its present eccentricity of .093, the eﬀect is even greater. The perihelion to aphelion ﬂux variation is 37%, or 219 W/m2. For Martian conditions, where the atmosphere has a weak greenhouse eﬀect, this translates into an amplitude of 30K. To determine the time dependence of r, we must know κ1(t).

know κ1(t). Because the orbit is no longer circular, the angular velocity is no longer constant; the planet moves faster when is close to the sun than when it is farther away. There is no analytic expression for the time variation of the orbital position. However, it can be easily computed by numerically solving a ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation, which can be derived either from Kepler’s equal-area law, or directly from angular momentum conservation. We shall take the latter route. Let v⊥be the component of116 CHAPTER 8. VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE WITH SEASON AND LATITUDE velocity perpendicular to the line joining the planet to its star. Then, by conservation of angular momemtum, rv⊥=Jis independant of time. However, the angular velocity of the orbit is simply v⊥/r, so the angle satisﬁes the equation dκ1 dt=J r2=J a2(1 +ecos(κ1))2 (1−e2)2(8.27) This equation shows that the angular velocity of the planet speeds up as it approaches perihelion, and slows down as it approaches aphelion. In consequence, the planet spends less time near the sun than it does at greater distances, and ”distance summer” is shorter than ”distance winter.” The average of the solar constant over the course of the year can be written < L > =1 4πIo a2<a2 r2>=La<a2 r2> (8.28) where angle brackets denote the average over the planet’s year and Lais the solar constant eval- uated at a distance equal to the semi-major axis of the orbit. We can take advantage of the fact that the same 1 /r2factor appears in Eqn. 8.27 to relate the mean solar constant to the nondi- mensionalized duration of the planet’s year.

planet’s year. Speciﬁcally, integrating Eqn. 8.27 over one year and dividing by the length of the year yields < L > =1 τ∗yLa (8.29) where τ∗ y=τy/(2πa2/J),τybeing the length of the year in dimensional terms. The quantity 2πa2/Jis the length of year for a circular orbit with radius a. Numerical integration of Eqn. 8.27 shows that the nondimensional year deﬁned in this way decreases as the orbit becomes more eccentric. For e=.1,τ∗ yis.995, for e=.25,τ∗ yis.968, and e=.5,τ∗ yis.866. Most planets have nearly circular orbits; leaving out Mercury and Pluto, the other planets have current eccentricities ranging from .007 to .093. Even Pluto, the most eccentric planet, only has a value of .244. Note that the diﬀerence between perihelion and aphelion distance is O(e), whereas the ratio of major to minor axes deviates from unity by only O(e2). Hence, for small e, the orbit still looks like a circle, but with the Sun displaced from the circle’s center by O(e). For small e, Eqn. 8.27 can be solved approximately by a straightforward expansion in e. Substituting κ1(t) =J a2[t+eF(t) +e2G(t)] (8.30) into the equation and matching like terms in eyields the solution κ1= 2πt∗+ 2ecos 2πt∗+e2[πt∗+5π 2sin 4πt∗] +O(e3) (8.31) where t∗=tJ/(2πa2).

where t∗=tJ/(2πa2). The ﬁrst order term causes an O(e) variation in the orbital angular velocity over the course of the year, but it this term by itself does not alter the length of the year. Taking into account the second order term, it may be inferred that the nondimensional length of the year is approximately τ∗ y= 1−e2/2. In consequence, the annual mean insolation varies very little from what it would be for a circular orbit with radius equal to the semi-major axis. For e=.1, close to the present value for Mars, the eccentricity increases mean insolation by only .5%. For e=.02, similar to Earth at present, the increase is a meager .02%, or .274W/m2. Except in very unusual cases, orbital eccentricity aﬀects the climate through the intermediary of the seasonal cycle, and not through any eﬀect on the annual mean radiation budget.8.4. SOME ELEMENTARY ORBITAL MECHANICS 117 The consequences of orbital eccentricity for a planet’s climate derive from the way the distance seasons interact with the tilt seasons. Each of these types of seasons has a period of one planetary year, so the nature of the interaction is governed by the position in the orbit at which the Northern Hemisphere summer solstice occurs, measured relative to the position of the perihelion. This can be measured by an angle, called the precession angle orprecession phase . We will deﬁne the phase such that when it is zero, the Northern Hemisphere solstice occurs at the perihelion. It is also common to deﬁne the phase as the angle between the perihelion and the Northern Hemisphere spring (”vernal”) equinox. When the precession angle is zero, the distance seasons make the Northern Hemisphere seasonal cycle stronger, since ”Northern tilt summer” happens when the planet is closest to the Sun and ””Northern tilt winter” happens when the planet is farthers from the Sun.

the Sun. Conversely, the Southern Hemisphere seasonal cycle is attenuated when the precession angle is zero. When the precession angle is 180o, the situation is reversed between the hemispheres, with the Southern Hemisphere getting very hot summers and very cold winters, and the Northern Hemisphere experiencing more moderate seasons. When the precession angle is 90oor 270o, the solstices conditions are no longer modulated by the distance seasons, but instead the vernal equinox becomes warmer than the autumnal equinox, or vice versa . Figure 8.11 illustrates the eﬀect of eccentricity and precession on the seasonal cycle of insolation. These results were computed by numerically solving Eq. 8.27, and substituting κ1(t) into the ﬂux distribution function given by Eq 8.10 and Eq 8.9, after shifting its phase to account for the precession angle. Given κ1(t), we also know r(t). Using this, we multiply the ﬂux factor by (a/r(t))2to account for the variations in orbital distance. This is the quantity plotted, at selected latitudes, in Figure 8.11. One multiplies this ﬂux factor by the solar constant at a distance equal to the semi-major axis, in order to obtain the actual insolation in W/m2. Using the symmetries of Eqn. 8.9, the results for precession angles of 180oand 270ocan be obtained from those shown in Figure 8.11 by simply shifting the curves shown by a half year, and interchanging the two hemispheres, so these cases do not require separate discussion. For both eccentricities, we see that the Northern Hemisphere extratropical seasonal cycle is made more extreme when the precession angle is 0o, while that in the Southern Hemisphere is moderated. At the Equator, the two equinoxes have identical insolation, but the time of maximum equatorial insolation is shifted towards the Northern summer solstice, which is also the time of perihelion in this case.

this case. For the larger, Marslike, eccentricity ( e=.1), the maximum equatorial insolation in fact occurs at the solstice. For the case of 90oobliquity, the extratropical seasonal cycle has identical strength in both hemispheres, but the equinox conditions now diﬀer from each other, the Autumnal equinox receiving less insolation than the Vernal (Spring) equinox. Also, the time of maximum and minimum extratropical insolation is also signiﬁcantly displaced from what it would be for a circular orbit. The eﬀect of orbital velocity variations on the seasonal cycle is just barely visible for the lower, Earthlike, eccentricity, but it is prominent for the higher eccentricity case. For 0oprecession, Summer is longer than Winter in the Southern hemisphere, while Winter is longer than Summer in the Northern hemisphere; for 90oprecession, there is a marked asymmetry between the rate of increase of insolation going into each season, and the rate of decrease coming out of it. For example, in the Northern Hemisphere, Summer sets in rapidly, but the transition to Winter takes a long time. In fact the Northern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere and equatorial insolation maxima are all bunched up within a period of about a quarter of a year, indicating that the distance seasons are beginning to dominate the tilt seasons even at this modest eccentricity. The eﬀect of precession phase on the annual average insolation at each latitude is insigniﬁcant; for both the high and low eccentricity cases shown in Figure 8.11, changing the precession phase leaves the annual mean ﬂux factor unchanged to at least four decimal places. Note that the precession angle has a big eﬀect on climate when the eccentricity is large, but118 CHAPTER 8.

and 45S. To obtain the insolation at any given time of year, this ﬂux factor is multiplied by the solar constant at the time of perihelion. Results are shown for an Earthlike eccentricity of .02 (top row), and a Marslike eccentricity of .1 (bottom row). The left column gives results for a precessional phase of zero degrees, while the right gives results for 90 degrees, both measured relative to the Northern Hemisphere summer solstice.8.5. EFFECT OF LONG TERM VARIATION OF ORBITAL PARAMETERS 119 has no eﬀect when the eccentricity is zero. The eﬀects of precession angle and orbital eccentricity work in conjunction with each other, and cannot be disentangled. At present, Earth’s precession angle is close to 180o, so that the Southern hemisphere is driven towards hotter summers and colder winters, while the Northern hemisphere is driven towards a weaker seasonal cycle. This pattern is not manifest in the observations (Figure 8.1) because the Northern Hemisphere has more land than the Southern Hemisphere, giving it a stronger seasonal cycle, owing to its lower thermal inertia. Relatively speaking, though, the Northern Hemisphere seasonal cycle is weaker than it would be if the precession angle were 90oor 0o. Coincidentally, the precession angle of Mars is also about 180oat present, so that the Southern Hemisphere Martian winters are expected to be considerably colder than those in the North. Evidence that this indeed occurs, and its broader implications for Martian climate, will be taken up in Section 8.6. The precession angles and orbital eccentricities of Earth and Mars have been diﬀerent in the past, and will be diﬀerent in the future. This has some extremely important implications for the evolution of climate, to which we now turn our attention. 8.5 Eﬀect of long term variation of orbital parameters The three orbital parameters that govern the seasonal and geographical distribution of insolation are the precession angle, obliquity, and eccentricity.

and eccentricity. All three change gradually on a scale of many thousands of years, owing basic laws of mechanics which apply to any planet in any solar system. The evolution of the precession angle derives from a fairly elementary property of the me- chanics of rigid-body rotation. The rotation axis of a rotating body subject to a net torque executes a rotation at constant rate about a second axis whose orientation is determined by the torque. The precession rate is determined by the magnitude of the torque and the angular momentum of the rotating body. The phenomenon of precession can be easily observed on a tabletop, by setting down a toy gyroscope with its axis inclined from the vertical. The top will precess, because there is a torque caused by the Earth’s gravity and the force of the tabletop pushing up on the point of the top. For planets, the torque instead is provided by the slight deviations of the mass distribution from spherical symmetry. The equatorial bulge caused by rotation is a major player, but other asymmetries, including those due to the distribution of ice, and of major geographic features, are also of consequence. Obliquity variations also stem from the basic properties of rigid-body rotation, but these variations arise from ﬂuctuations in the torque on the planet, rather than the mean torque. The obliquity cycle is inextricably linked with the precessional cycle, which modulates the orientation of the aspherical planet with respect to the non-uniform gravitational ﬁeld caused by the Sun, the planet’s moon(s) (if suﬃciently massive), and all the other planets. Eccentricity evolves because the periodic elliptical orbit is a solution only of the two-body problem, consisting of a planet and its star in isolation. Although the gravity of the Sun greatly dominates that of the other planets in our Solar System (and most likely in other planetary systems as well) the relatively small tugs of the planets on each other causes eccentricity to change gradually.

change gradually. Early in the history of this subject, it was shown by Laplace and Lagrange that the semi-major axis remains very nearly constant in the course of such eccentricity changes. The results of the preceding section therefore imply that eccentricity cycles have only a weak eﬀect on annual mean insolation, since the mean insolation changes little if the semi-major axis is held ﬁxed, except for extremely non-circular orbits.120 CHAPTER 8. VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE WITH SEASON AND LATITUDE Tiny deviations of the stellar gravity ﬁeld from the ideal 1 /r2law add up to signiﬁcant eﬀects on obliquity and eccentricity over suﬃciently long periods of time. The fact that the Sun is not perfectly spherical enters the problem, and even general relativistic deviations from Newtonian gravity have major eﬀects. Eccentricity modulates the distance seasons, and precession determines whether they con- structively or destructively interfere with the tilt seasons. Meanwhile, obliquity variations modu- late the strength of the tilt seasons. The net result is a rich variety of rhythms and patterns in insolation, which may lead to dramatic cycles in the state of a planet’s climate. 8.5.1 Milankovic cycles on Earth Earth’s precessional cycle is shown in Figure 8.12. The precession angle increases at a nearly constant rate, completing a cycle every 22,000 years. Though the variation in rate is not evident over any one cycle, the rate is not exactly constant, and therefore the phase drifts over the course of hundreds of thousands of years. The precessional cycle is very rapid, and the precession angle has changed markedly even over historical times. Eight thousand years ago, when the ﬁrst Sumerians poured into the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, the star we now call Polaris (the ”Pole Star”, in the tail of the Little Bear) was about 40oof arc away from the star that the the North Polar axis then pointed to,and about which the constellations rotated at the time.

the time. The consequences of precession for change in seasonality are potentially highly consequential. In Figure 8.12, the July insolation at 65N is shown as a general indication of the magnitude of the seasonality eﬀect; high northern July insolation in the precessional cycle goes with low January northern insolation, weak southern January (summer) insolation, and relatively strong southern July (winter) insolation. Ten thousand years ago, the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation was fully 40 W/m2greater than at present, and so the northern summers should have been considerably warmer than today, while the northern winters should have been considerably colder. The eﬀect should show up especially over land, which is dark enough to absorb most of the solar radiation and has low enough thermal inertia to respond nearly instantaneously to seasonal changes. The climate system in its full glory is nonlinear and complex, so the response of climate to this change in seasonality could show up in any number of unexpected ways, and not simply as an enhancement of the Northern Hemisphere seasonal cycle over land. The event which is most likely to be a recent manifestation of the precessional cycle is the ”Climatic Optimum,” covering the period of about 5000 to 7000 years ago (see Chapter 1). The term is most often used to refer to a period of generally warmer Eurasian temperatures. The ”optimum” is sometimes said to be about 1-2K warmer than present, but it is diﬃcult to get reliable estimates of global mean temperatures, or even annual means. What is certain is that some regions during some seasons were warmer than they were at recent pre-industrial times. At about the same time, the Sahara, which is now a torrid desert, experienced a period of greening, with currently dry riverbeds (”wadis”) ﬁlled with water, and a teeming variety of animal life and ﬂora not known at present.

at present. The greening of the Sahara is thought to be associated with atmospheric circulation systems known as ”monsoons,” forced to a greater extent by the enhanced heating of Northern Hemisphere subtropical land. A central question, though, is why the greening of the Sahara, and the Climatic Optimum occurred several thousand years after the precessional peak in Northern Hemisphere insolation. There are some indications that the warming may have begun as much as 10,000 years ago, but the question of the physics accounting for the time delay in response remains unsettled. Candidates for the necessary inertia in climate response include vegetation adaptation,8.5.

Looking further back in time, the obliquity and eccentricity variations become signiﬁcant, though of course, the precession cycle also continues to have a large eﬀect. The Earth’s obliq- uity and eccentricity cycle is shown in Figure 8.13. The amplitude of the obliquity cycle varies considerably over time, but it’s dominant period is on the order of 40,000 years. The Earth’s obliquity varies narrowly in a range from about 22oto 24 .5o. At present, the Earth is in the middle of its obliquity range.

obliquity range. Eccentricity varies on a longer time scale of approximately 100,000 years. However, in Figure 8.13 there are also hints of 400,000 year cycle of eccentricity, whose ﬁngerprint consists of two high eccentricity cycles followed by two low eccentricity cycles. This visual impression is borne out by spectral analysis. Currently, the Earth is near the low end of its eccentricity range, though it has gotten quite close to zero during the past two million years. At the other extreme, Earth’s eccentricity has gotten as high as .055, or more than half that of Mars. The idea that ice ages are due to changes in Earth’s orbital parameters is nearly as old as the discovery of ice ages themselves. The idea has gained currency, but it is nearly as hard to justify today on basic physical principles as it was when ﬁrst proposed. The main reason for its acceptance is circumstantial, in that increasingly detailed data on the observed rhythm of the ice ages shows the unmistakable imprint of the calculated rhythm of the orbital forcing. James Croll ﬁrst proposed in the 1870’s that changes in the Earth’s eccentricity led to ice ages, and his idea was reﬁned a half century later by Milutin Milankovic, whose name is now generally attached to the theory. The centerpiece of Milankovic’s idea is that ice ages require the accumulation of snow on land, and that122 CHAPTER 8.

and eccentricity. Data taken from Berger and Loutre (1991).8.5. EFFECT OF LONG TERM VARIATION OF ORBITAL PARAMETERS 123 this in turn is favored by mild summers (limiting melting of old snow and ice) and warmer, but still sub-freezing, winters (favoring snow accumulation, since warmer air contains more water). The gaping hole in Milankovic’s theory is that it predicts that ice ages should follow the precessional cycle. In particular, the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere should have ice ages in alternation every 10,000 years, with the severity of the ice ages modulated by the eccentricity cycle. This is not at all what is observed. Figure 8.14 shows the Antarctic temperature record for the past 400,000 years, together with eccentricity and the July insolation at 65N. Numerous other temperature proxies worldwide show that the Northern Hemisphere temperature, and global glacier ice volume, is nearly in phase with the Antarctic temperature record, so that the Antarctic temperature can be taken as an index of when the world is in an ice age. The dominant signal in the climate response is an approximately 100,000 year spacing in the major interglacial warm periods, and a similar spacing in the coldest glacial periods. Crudely speaking, each interglacial corresponds to a peak in eccentricity, and a time within which (during parts of the precessional cycle) the Northern Hemisphere seasonality is unusually strong. This is somewhat reminiscent of the Milankovic mechanism, but what ﬁlters out the high frequency precessional cycle? Why does the entire Earth fall into an ice age at the same time, rather than alternating between hemispheres? A closer examination of the 65N July insolation strongly suggests that major global deglaciations occur when the Northern Hemisphere seasonality is weak, suggesting that the Earth listens to the Northern hemisphere forcing more than the Southern, in deciding when to have an ice age.

ice age. This probably has something to do with the fact that the Northern hemisphere has more land, and hence more seasonality, than the Summer, but the precise way this asymmetry inﬂuences global glaciation remains largely obscure. The problem is not that the amplitude of radiative forcing associated with Milankovic cycles is small: it amounts to an enormous 100 W/m2, with the amplitude determined by the eccentricity cycle. The problem is that the forcing occurs on the fast precessional time scale, whereas the climate response is predominately on a much slower 100,000 year time scale. One does not so much need an ampliﬁer of Milankovic forcing, as a ”rectiﬁer,” which is sensitive to the amplitude of the precessional variation, rather than to its mean. Recall that atmospheric CO2is observed to vary on the glacial-interglacial time scale. Certainly, this is a major piece of the puzzle, since the drop in CO2during glacial times is suﬃcient to account for a major portion of the cooling of the climate, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere (see Chapter 4). CO2is a globalizing eﬀect, and (insofar as it is linked to the glacial-interglacial physical climate changes) an amplifying feedback. The circumstantial role of CO2in ice ages is also a reprise of an old idea. The 19th century physicist Tyndall, whose work on infrared spectroscopy is at the foundations of our current understanding of the greenhouse eﬀect, was primarily interested in explaining the ice ages, and the association reappeared later in the work of Chamberlain. The mechanism of the CO2cycle not known, but almost certainly involves CO2storage in the deep ocean. The lack of a theory for the glacial-interglacial CO2cycle is the central impediment to a theory of the ice ages.

ice ages. The presence of ice does seem to be a prerequisite for a strong climate response to orbital forcing. Before the onset of permanent polar ice at the beginning of the Pleistocene, response to orbital forcing was weak (see Chapter 1). Besides CO2, ocean circulations can potentially play a major role in globalizing and rectifying the Northern Hemisphere signal, through direct heat transport as well as indirect eﬀects on CO2. The answer to the mystery of the ice ages lies somewhere in the space: ice,ocean, CO2, but how the system works its miracles to yield a 100,000 year cycle is still unknown.124 CHAPTER 8.

EFFECT OF LONG TERM VARIATION OF ORBITAL PARAMETERS 125 8.5.2 Milankovic cycles on Mars As expected from general mechanical considerations, Mars has Milankovic cycles analogous to those of Earth. Mars’ cycles diﬀer in some key respects, because of the lack of a massive moon, and because of the proximity of Jupiter.

of Jupiter. As for Earth, the precession angle of Mars increases at a nearly constant rate. However, because Mars does not have a moon as massive as Earth’s, the precession is dominated by Solar gravity, and is slower. The Mars precessional cycle has a period of approximately 50,000 Earth years. The current precession phase is 145o, and will reach 180oin about 5000 years. The obliquity and eccentricity variations are shown in Figure 8.15. Obliquity has short term variations with amplitude on the order of 20o. The period is not visible in the ﬁgure, but a ﬁner scale examination of the data shows that the period is about 125,000 Earth years in recent times. The amplitude is markedly larger than that of Earth’s obliquity cycle, but what is even more remarkable is that the obliquity drifts to values as large as 47oover 10 million years. The extreme obliquity variations are directly linked to the absence of Earth’s massive moon, which can be shown to provide a considerable damping eﬀect on obliquity. This raises the intriguing possibility that a massive moon may be a necessary condition for a planet to avoid extreme climate ﬂuctuations that could compromise its habitability. Calculations of the Earth’s obliquity have also been carried out for tens of millions of years, and do not yield any greater variations than have been encountered in the past million years. Mars is close to its maximum eccentricity at present, though it can get somewhat larger. The eccentricity of Mars undergoes quasiperiodic large amplitude cycles with a period on the order of 3 million years. In addition, there are short period, lower amplitude eccentricity variations with a period on the order of 100,000 years, rather similar to Earth’s. In contrast, the very long period variations are not found in Earth’s eccentricity.

Earth’s eccentricity. Mars has no ocean, little thermal inertia, and a thin atmosphere that has a relatively modest eﬀect on the planet’s surface temperature. These features should lead to a diﬀerent, and perhaps simpler, response to orbital forcing on Mars as compared to Earth. The predicted climate changes have been simulated in detail using comprehensive climate models, but we will conﬁne ourselves here to some general remarks. The main eﬀect of Martian Milankovic cycles is likely to be the redistribution of water deposits, in the form of either glaciers or permafrost. There are two aspects to this redistribution. On the short precessional time scale, the asymmetry between the Northern and Southern polar ice caps should reverse. For example, about 25000 years ago, the Southern hemisphere should have had milder summers and winters, while the Northern had cold winters and hot summers; the default reasoning would imply that at such times, the Southern ice cap should be large and be composed mainly of water ice, whereas the Northern ice cap becomes smaller and experiences massive seasonal CO2snow deposition. On the time scale of millions of years, the obliquity of Mars becomes much greater, leading potentially to a situation where water my migrate from poles that are seasonally very hot, and re-deposit in the tropics. At times of much lower obliquity, permafrost ice may migrate to both poles. The migration of water deposits and changes in patterns of deposition of CO2snow probably leaves some imprint on the surface geology of Mars, and the growth and decay of glaciers certainly does. These oﬀer some prospects for reconstructing the consequences of Milankovic cycles on Mars. Even better information would be obtained through analyzing cores of the polar ice caps, much as is done in Antarctica and Greenland. It is a very exciting development that the technology for doing this robotically on Mars is already under development. With respect to Mars, we are more or less at the stage of Croll or Milankovic, who thought they found the key to Earth’s ice ages.

A PALETTE OF PLANETARY SEASONAL CYCLES 127 that we do not yet have a satisfactory theory leading from orbital variations to climate response on Earth, one can look forward to many surprises, once data on the Martian climate response becomes available. 8.6 A palette of planetary seasonal cycles In this section we apply the preceding ideas to a range of planets (including Earth under very diﬀerent past climate regimes), to see how they play out. This section is still under development. The following provides an outline of topics to be covered. Each topic will be supplemented so far as possible by observations or (when observations are unavailable) GCM simulations, illustrating the behavior inferred from the basic reasoning. 8.6.1 Airless planets and moons This includes a discussion of Earth’s moon, as well as nearly airless exotic cases like Triton. Pluto is an interesting case, because of its high eccentricity; like Triton, it should have a seasonal nitrogen ”micro-atmosphere.” 8.6.2 Venus Slow rotation implies no real distinction between seasonal and diurnal cycles. High thermal inertia, and eﬃcient atmospheric heat transport. Therefore no signiﬁcant geographical or seasonal/diurnal variation of temperature, except in the upper stratosphere.

Can we have seasonal summertime melting? Can we form transient or permanent CO2glaciers? 8.6.5 Snowball Earth A full glaciated Snowball Earth is more like Mars than like present Earth. Low thermal inertia of surface. High albedo implies weaker solar driving, and lower temperatures imply less role of water vapor and clouds. This section is based in part on my papers in Nature and JGR on the Snowball Earth, and datasets from those simulations will be provided for use with the Workbook. 8.6.6 Hothouse Earth This section deals with climates like the Cretaceous, with no permanent polar ice.

polar ice. A particular emphasis is on the extreme seasonal cycle of polar continents, the moderate high latitude maritime seasonal cycle, and the diﬃculty of ”getting rid of winter” in the interior of midlatitude continents. 8.6.7 Earth without a moon This is an exercise in habitability and comparative planetology. If the Earth had no mssive moon, its obliquity would vary over a wider range, like that of Mars. What are the consequences for climate? For a waterworld, high obliquity actually leads to a fairly equable climate, but life on large continents becomes very problematic. 8.6.8 Titan Remark on the obliquity of moons: one must be careful to distinguish the obliquity relative to the plane of the moon’s orbit from the obliquity relative to the ecliptic. This is critical in cases like Titan, which are tide-locked to the parent planet. Observations of Titan seasonal cycle. Expectations from thermal inertia and obliquity. Low rotation rate and thick atmosphere means that the atmosphere can transport heat very eﬃciently,and the very weak solar forcing means the atmosphere doesn’t need to transport much heat to equalize the temperature. Upper atmospheric vs. surface solar heating. Implications of the methane and nitrogen ”hydrological” cycles.Chapter 9 Evolution of the atmosphere This chapter goes over some of the basics of how atmospheres change over time. The primary attention is given to models of the long term CO2evolution in terms of silicate weathering, after the fashion of Walker and Kasting, and of Berner. Models of atmospheric mass loss (thermal escape, hydrodynamic escape, solar wind sputtering and ejection due to giant collisions) are also discussed. A very basic survey of some relevant atmospheric chemistry is also included. The focus here would be on the interplay of methane and oxygen in Earthlike conditions, the formation of tholin clouds on Titan and Early Earth, and the chemistry accounting for CO2stability on Mars.
