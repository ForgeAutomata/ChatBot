DuringmyexperienceofteachingaircraftstructuresIhavefelttheneedforatextbook writtenspeciﬁcallyforstudentsofaeronauticalengineering.Althoughtherehavebeena number of excellent books written on the

The book in intended for students studying for degrees, Higher National Diplomas andHigherNationalCertiﬁcatesinaeronauticalengineeringandwillbefoundofvalueto those students in related courses who specialize in structures. The subject matterhas been chosen to provide the student with a textbook which will take him from thebeginningofthesecondyearofhiscourse,whenspecializationusuallybegins,uptoandincludinghisﬁnalexamination.Ihavearrangedthetopicssothattheymaybestudiedto an appropriate level in, say, the second year and then resumed at a more advancedstageintheﬁnalyear;forexample,theinstabilityofcolumnsandbeamsmaybestudiedas examples of structural instability at second year level while the instability of platesandstiffenedpanelscouldbestudiedintheﬁnalyear.Inaddition,Ihavegroupedsomesubjects under unifying headings to emphasize their interrelationship; thus, bending,shearandtorsionofopenandclosedtubesaretreatedinasinglechaptertounderlinethefactthattheyarejustdifferentloadingcasesofbasicstructuralcomponentsratherthanisolatedtopics.Irealizehoweverthatthemoderntrendistopresentmethodsofanalysisin general terms and then consider speciﬁc applications. Nevertheless, I feel that incases such as those described above it is beneﬁcial for the student’s understanding ofthesubjecttoseethecloserelationshipsandsimilaritiesamongstthedifferentportionsof theory. Part I of the book, ‘Fundamentals of Elasticity’, Chapters 1–6, includes sufﬁcient elasticity theory to provide the student with the basic tools of structural analysis. Theworkisstandardbutthepresentationinsomeinstancesisoriginal.InChapter4Ihaveendeavoured to clarify the use of energy methods of analysis and present a consistent,but general, approach to the various types of structural problem for which energymethodsareemployed.Thus,althoughavarietyofmethodsarediscussed,emphasisisplaced on the methods of complementary and potential energy.

An introduction to computational methods ofstructural analysis is presented in Chapter 11 which also includes some elementarywork on the relatively modern ﬁnite element method for continuum structures. Finally, Part III, ‘Airworthiness and Aeroelasticity’, Chapters 12 and 13, are self explanatory.

The ﬁrst ﬁve chapters remain essentially the same as in the ﬁrst edition except for some minor changes in presentation. In Chapter 6, Section 6.12 has been rewritten and extended to include ﬂexural– torsional buckling of thin-walled columns; Section 6.13 has also been rewritten topresent the theory of tension ﬁeld beams in a more logical form. ThediscussionofcompositematerialsinChapter7hasbeenextendedinthelightof modern developments and the sections concerned with the function and fabrication ofstructuralcomponentsnowincludeillustrationsofactualaircraftstructuresofdifferenttypes.The topic of structural idealization has been removed to Chapter 8. Chapter 8 has been retitled and the theory presented in a different manner. Matrix notationisusedinthederivationoftheexpressionfordirectstressduetounsymmetricalbending and the ‘bar’notation discarded. The theory of the torsion of closed sectionshasbeenextendedtoincludeadiscussionofthemechanicsofwarping,andthetheoryfor the secondary warping of open sections amended. Also included is the analysisof combined open and closed sections. Structural idealization has been removed fromChapter 7 and is introduced here so that the effects of structural idealization on theanalysis follow on logically. An alternative method for the calculation of shear ﬂowdistributions is presented. Chapter 9 has been retitled and extended to the analysis of actual structural com- ponents such as tapered spars and beams, fuselages and multicell wing sections. Themethodofsuccessiveapproximationsisincludedfortheanalysisofmanycelledwingsand the effects of cut-outs in wings and fuselages are considered. In addition the cal-culation of loads on and the analysis of fuselage frames and wing ribs is presented. Inaddition to the analysis of structural components composite materials are consideredwith the determination of the elastic constants for a composite together with their usein the fabrication of plates.FM-H6739.tex 1/2/2007 11: 48 Page xvi xvi Preface to Second Edition Chapter 10 remains an investigation into structural constraint, although the presen- tationhasbeenchangedparticularlyinthecaseofthestudyofshearlag.Thetheoryfor therestrainedwarpingofopensectionbeamsnowincludesgeneralsystemsofloadingand introduces the concept of a moment couple or bimoment. OnlyminorchangeshavebeenmadetoChapter11whileChapter12nowincludesa detailed study of fatigue, the fatigue strength of components, the prediction of fatiguelife and crack propagation. Finally, Chapter 13 now includes a much more detailedinvestigation of ﬂutter and the determination of critical ﬂutter speed. I am indebted to Professor D. J. Mead of the University of Southampton for many useful comments and suggestions. I am also grateful to Mr K. Broddle of British Aerospace for supplying photographs and drawings of aircraft structures. T.H.G. Megson 1989FM-H6739.tex 1/2/2007 11: 48 Page xvii Preface to Third Edition The publication of a third edition and its accompanying solutions manual has allowed me to take a close look at the contents of the book and also to test the accuracy of the answers to the examples in the text and the problems set at the end of each chapter. I have reorganised the book into two parts as opposed, previously, to three. Part I, Elasticity, contains, as before, the ﬁrst six chapters which are essentially the sameexceptfortheadditionoftwoillustrativeexamplesinChapter1andoneinChapter4. Part II, Chapters 7 to 13, is retitledAircraft structures, with Chapter 12,Airworthi- ness, now becoming Chapter 8, Airworthiness and airframe loads, since it is logicalthat loads on aircraft produced by different types of manoeuvre are considered beforethe stress distributions and displacements caused by these loads are calculated. Chapter 7 has been updated to include a discussion of the latest materials used in aircraftconstructionwithanemphasisonthedifferentrequirementsofcivilandmilitaryaircraft. Chapter 8, as described above, now contains the calculation of airframe loads pro- duced by different types of manoeuvre and has been extended to consider the inertialoads caused, for example, by ground manoeuvres such as landing. Chapter 9 (previously Chapter 8) remains unchanged apart from minor corrections while Chapter 10 (9) is unchanged except for the inclusion of an example on thecalculationofstressesanddisplacementsinalaminatedbar;anextraproblemhasbeenincluded at the end of the chapter. Chapter 11 (10), Structural constraint, is unchanged while in Chapter 12 (11) the discussion of the ﬁnite element method has been extended to include the four nodequadrilateralelementtogetherwithillustrativeexamplesonthecalculationofelementstiffnesses; a further problem has been added at the end of the chapter. Chapter 13, Aeroelasticity, has not been changed from Chapter 13 in the second edition apart from minor corrections. I am indebted to, formerly, David Ross and, latterly, Matthew Flynn ofArnold for their encouragement and support during this project. T.H.G. Megson 1999This page intentionally left blank FM-H6739.tex 1/2/2007 11: 48 Page xix Preface to Fourth Edition Ihavereviewedthethreepreviouseditionsofthebookanddecidedthatamajoroverhaul wouldbebeneﬁcial,particularlyinthelightofdevelopmentsintheaircraftindustryandintheteachingofthesubject.Present-daystudentsprefernumerousworkedexamplesand problems to solve so that I have included more worked examples in the text andmore problems at the end of each chapter. I also felt that some of the chapters weretoo long. I have therefore broken down some of the longer chapters into shorter, more‘digestible’ones. For example, the previous Chapter 9 which covered bending, shearandtorsionofopenandclosedsectionthin-walledbeamsplustheanalysisofcombinedopen and closed section beams, structural idealization and deﬂections now forms thecontentsofChapters16–20.Similarly,theThirdEditionChapter10‘StressAnalysisof AircraftComponents’isnowcontainedinChapters21–25while‘StructuralInstability’, Chapter 6 in theThird Edition, is now covered by Chapters 8 and 9. In addition to breaking down the longer chapters I have rearranged the material to emphasize the application of the fundamentals of structural analysis, contained inPartA, to the analysis of aircraft structures which forms Part B. For example, MatrixMethods, which were included in ‘Part II,Aircraft Structures’in theThird Edition arenowincludedinPartAsincetheyarebasictogeneralstructuralanalysis;similarlyforstructural vibration. Partsofthetheoryhavebeenexpanded.InPartA,virtualworknowmeritsachapter (Chapter4)toitselfsinceIbelievethispowerfulandimportantmethodisworthanin-depthstudy.Theworkontensionﬁeldbeams(Chapter9)hasbecomepartofthechapteronthinplatesandhasbeenextendedtoincludepost-bucklingbehaviour.Materials,inPart B, now contains a section on material properties while, in response to readers’comments,thehistoricalreviewhasbeendiscarded.ThedesignofrivettedconnectionshasbeenaddedtotheconsiderationofstructuralcomponentsofaircraftinChapter12whiletheworkoncrackpropagationhasbeenextendedinChapter15.Themethodofsuccessive approximations for multi-cellular wings has been dropped since, in thesecomputer-driven times, it is of limited use and does not advance an understanding ofthe behaviour of structures. On the other hand the study of composite structures hasbeen expanded as these form an increasing part of a modern aircraft’s structure. Finally,aCaseStudy,thedesignofpartoftherearfuselageofamythicaltrainer/semi- aerobatic aeroplane is presented in theAppendix to illustrate the application of someof the theory contained in this book.FM-H6739.tex 1/2/2007 11: 48 Page xx xx Preface to Fourth Edition IwouldliketothankJonathanSimpsonofElsevierwhoinitiatedtheprojectandwho collatedtheveryhelpfulreaders’comments,Margaret,mywife,forsufferingthelong hours I sat at my word processor, and Jasmine, Lily,Tom and Bryony who are alwaysan inspiration.

The third section is deferred until the end of the chapter to emphasizethe fact that the analysis of stress and strain, for example the equations of equilibriumand compatibility, does not assume a particular stress–strain law.

It follows that at any internal point O there is a resultant force Fig. 1.1 Internal force at a point in an arbitrarily shaped body.Ch01-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 6 6Basic elasticity Fig. 1.2 Internal force components at the point O. δP.TheparticleofmaterialatOsubjectedtotheforce δPisinequilibriumsothatthere mustbeanequalbutoppositeforce δP(showndottedinFig.1.1)actingontheparticle at the same time. If we now divide the body by any plane nncontaining O then these two forces δPmay be considered as being uniformly distributed over a small area δA ofeachfaceoftheplaneatthecorrespondingpointOasinFig.1.2.The stressatOis then deﬁned by the equation Stress =lim δA→0δP δA(1.1) The directions of the forces δPin Fig. 1.2 are such as to produce tensilestresses on the faces of the plane nn. It must be realized here that while the direction of δPis absolute the choice of plane is arbitrary, so that although the direction of the stress at O will always be in the direction of δPits magnitude depends upon the actual plane chosensinceadifferentplanewillhaveadifferentinclinationandthereforeadifferentvalue for the area δA. This may be more easily understood by reference to the bar in simpletensioninFig.1.3.Onthecross-sectionalplane mmtheuniformstressisgiven byP/A,whileontheinclinedplanem /primem/primethestressisofmagnitude P/A/prime.Inbothcases the stresses are parallel to the direction of P. Generally, the direction of δPis not normal to the area δA, in which case it is usual to resolve δPinto two components: one, δPn, normal to the plane and the other, δPs, acting in the plane itself (see Fig. 1.2). Note that in Fig. 1.2 the plane containing δP is perpendicular to δA.The stresses associated with these components are a normalor direct stress deﬁned as σ=lim δA→0δPn δA(1.2) and ashear stress deﬁned as τ=lim δA→0δPs δA(1.3)Ch01-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 6 1.2 Notation for forces and stresses 7 Fig. 1.3 Values of stress on different planes in a uniform bar. The resultant stress is computed from its components by the normal rules of vector addition, namely Resultant stress =/radicalbig σ2+τ2 Generally, however, as indicated above, we are interested in the separate effects of σ andτ. However, to be strictly accurate, stress is not a vector quantity for, in addition to magnitude and direction, we must specify the plane on which the stress acts. Stress is therefore a tensor, its complete description depending on the two vectors of force and surface of action. 1.2 Notation for forces and stresses It is usually convenient to refer the state of stress at a point in a body to an orthogonalset of axes Oxyz. In this case we cut the body by planes parallel to the direction of theaxes. The resultant force δPacting at the point O on one of these planes may then be resolved into a normal component and two in-plane components as shown in Fig. 1.4,therebyproducingonecomponentofdirectstressandtwocomponentsofshearstress. Thedirectstresscomponentisspeciﬁedbyreferencetotheplaneonwhichitactsbut the stress components require a speciﬁcation of direction in addition to the plane. Wethereforeallocateasinglesubscripttodirectstresstodenotetheplaneonwhichitactsand two subscripts to shear stress, the ﬁrst specifying the plane, the second direction. ThereforeinFig.1.4,theshearstresscomponentsare τ zxandτzyactingonthe zplane and in the xandydirections, respectively, while the direct stress component is σz.Ch01-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 6 8Basic elasticity We may now completely describe the state of stress at a point O in a body by specifyingcomponentsofshearanddirectstressonthefacesofanelementofside δx, δy,δz, formed at O by the cutting planes as indicated in Fig. 1.5.

Two types of external force may act on a body to produce the internal stress system we have already discussed. Of these, surface forces such asP 1,P2,..., or hydrostatic pressure, are distributed over the surface area of the body. The surface force per unitarea may be resolved into components parallel to our orthogonal system of axes andthese are generally given the symbols X,YandZ.

These aredistributedoverthevolumeofthebodyandthecomponentsofbodyforceperunitvolume are designated X,YandZ. 1.3 Equations of equilibrium Generally, except in cases of uniform stress, the direct and shear stresses on oppositefaces of an element are not equal as indicated in Fig. 1.5 but differ by small amounts. Therefore if, say, the direct stress acting on the zplane is σ zthen the direct stress acting on the z+δzplane is, from the ﬁrst two terms of a Taylor’s series expansion, σz+(∂σz/∂z)δz.

In Section 1.6 the direct and shear stresses on an inclined plane were shown to be given by σn=σxcos2θ+σysin2θ+τxysin2θ (Eq.

Equation (1.8) may be rewritten in the form σn=σx 2(1+cos2θ)+σy 2(1−cos2θ)+τxysin2θ or σn−1 2(σx+σy)=1 2(σx−σy)cos2 θ+τxysin2θ Squaring and adding this equation to Eq.

Note that the construction of Fig. 1.12(b) corresponds to the stress system of Fig. 1.12(a) so that any sign reversal must be allowed for. Also, the Oσand Oτaxes must be constructed to the same scale or the equation of the circle is not represented.

Therefore, for an isotropic material 0 ≤ν≤0.5 and for most isotropic materials νis in the range 0.25–0.33 below the elastic limit. Above the limit of proportionality νincreases and approaches 0.5.

The boundary conditions for this method of solution must be speciﬁed as displacements. Determination of u,vandwenables the six strains to be com- puted from Eqs (1.18) and (1.20); the six unknown stresses follow from the equationsexpressing stress as functions of strain. It should be noted here that no use has beenmade of the compatibility equations. The fact that u,vandware determined directly ensures that they are single-valued functions, thereby satisfying the requirement ofcompatibility. In most structural problems the object is usually to ﬁnd the distribution of stress in anelasticbodyproducedbyanexternalloadingsystem.Itisthereforemoreconvenientin this case to determine the six stresses before calculating any required strains ordisplacements. This is accomplished by using Eqs (1.42) and (1.46) to rewrite thesix equations of compatibility in terms of stress. The resulting equations, in turn, aresimpliﬁed by making use of the stress relationships developed in the equations ofequilibrium. The solution of these equations automatically satisﬁes the conditions ofcompatibility and equilibrium throughout the body.Ch02-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 7 2.1 Two-dimensional problems 47 2.1 Two-dimensional problems For the reasons discussed in Chapter 1 we shall conﬁne our actual analysis to the two-dimensional cases of plane stress and plane strain. The appropriate equilibriumconditions for plane stress are given by Eqs (1.6), viz. ∂σ x ∂x+∂τxy ∂y+X=0 ∂σy ∂y+∂τyx ∂y+Y=0 and the required stress–strain relationships obtained from Eqs (1.47), namely εx=1 E(σx−νσy) εy=1 E(σy−νσx) γxy=2(1+ν) Eτxy Weﬁndthatalthough εzexists,Eqs(1.22)–(1.26)areidenticallysatisﬁedleavingEq.

Further, from the third of Eqs (1.42) σz=ν(σx+σy) (since εz=0 for plane strain) so that εx=1 E[(1−ν2)σx−ν(1+ν)σy] and εy=1 E[(1−ν2)σy−ν(1+ν)σx] Also γxy=2(1+ν) Eτxy Substituting as before in Eq.

For simplicity let us consider the two-dimensional case for which the body forces are zero.

It is subjectedto equal but opposite torques Tat each end, both of which are assumed to be free fromrestraintsothatwarpingdisplacements w,thatisdisplacementsofcross-sections normal to and out of their original planes, are unrestrained. Further, we make thereasonable assumptions that since no direct loads are applied to the bar σ x=σy=σz=0 Fig. 3.1 Torsion of a bar of uniform, arbitrary cross-section.Ch03-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 8 66 Torsion of solid sections and that the torque is resisted solely by shear stresses in the plane of the cross-section giving τxy=0 Toverifytheseassumptionswemustshowthattheremainingstressessatisfythecondi- tionsofequilibriumandcompatibilityatallpointsthroughoutthebarand,inaddition,fulﬁl the equilibrium boundary conditions at all points on the surface of the bar. If we ignore body forces the equations of equilibrium, (1.5), reduce, as a result of our assumptions, to ∂τ xz ∂z=0∂τyz ∂z=0∂τzx ∂x+∂τyz ∂y=0 (3.1) The ﬁrst two equations of Eqs (3.1) show that the shear stresses τxzandτyzare func- tions ofxandyonly. They are therefore constant at all points along the length of the bar which have the same xandycoordinates. At this stage we turn to the stress function to simplify the process of solution. Prandtl introduced a stress function φ deﬁned by ∂φ ∂x=−τzy∂φ ∂y=τzx (3.2) whichidenticallysatisﬁesthethirdoftheequilibriumequations(3.1)whateverform φ maytake.Wethereforehavetoﬁndthepossibleformsof φwhichsatisfythecompati- bility equations and the boundary conditions, the latter being, in fact, the requirementthat distinguishes one torsion problem from another. From the assumed state of stress in the bar we deduce that ε x=εy=εz=γxy=0 (see Eqs (1.42) and (1.46)) Further, since τxzandτyzand hence γxzandγyzare functions of xandyonly then the compatibility equations (1.21)–(1.23) are identically satisﬁed as is Eq. (1.26).Theremaining compatibility equations, (1.24) and (1.25), are then reduced to ∂ ∂x/parenleftbigg −∂γyz ∂x+∂γxz ∂y/parenrightbigg =0 ∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg∂γyz ∂x−∂γxz ∂y/parenrightbigg =0 Substituting initially for γyzandγxzfrom Eqs (1.46) and then for τzy(=τyz) andτzx(=τxz) from Eqs (3.2) gives ∂ ∂x/parenleftbigg∂2φ ∂x2+∂2φ ∂y2/parenrightbigg =0 −∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg∂2φ ∂x2+∂2φ ∂y2/parenrightbigg =0Ch03-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 8 3.1 Prandtl stress function solution 67 or ∂ ∂x∇2φ=0−∂ ∂y∇2φ=0 (3.3) where ∇2is the two-dimensional Laplacian operator /parenleftbigg∂2 ∂x2+∂2 ∂y2/parenrightbigg The parameter ∇2φis therefore constant at any section of the bar so that the function φmust satisfy the equation ∂2φ ∂x2+∂2φ ∂y2=constant =F(say) (3.4) at all points within the bar. Finallywemustensurethat φfulﬁlstheboundaryconditionsspeciﬁedbyEqs(1.7). On the cylindrical surface of the bar there are no externally applied forces so that ¯X=¯Y=¯Z=0. The direction cosine nis also zero and therefore the ﬁrst two equa- tions of Eqs (1.7) are identically satisﬁed, leaving the third equation as the boundary condition, i.e. τyzm+τxzl=0 (3.5) The direction cosines landmof the normal Nto any point on the surface of the bar are, by reference to Fig. 3.2 l=dy dsm=−dx ds(3.6) Substituting Eqs (3.2) and (3.6) into (3.5) we have ∂φ ∂xdx ds+∂φ ∂ydy ds=0 Fig. 3.2 Formation of the direction cosines landmof the normal to the surface of the bar.Ch03-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 8 68 Torsion of solid sections or ∂φ ds=0 Thusφis constant on the surface of the bar and since the actual value of this constant does not affect the stresses of Eq. (3.2) we may conveniently take the constant to be zero. Hence on the cylindrical surface of the bar we have the boundary condition φ=0 (3.7) On the ends of the bar the direction cosines of the normal to the surface have the valuesl=0,m=0andn=1.Therelatedboundaryconditions,fromEqs(1.7),arethen ¯X=τzx ¯Y=τzy ¯Z=0 We now observe that the forces on each end of the bar are shear forces which are dis- tributedovertheendsofthebarinthesamemannerastheshearstressesaredistributedover the cross-section.The resultant shear force in the positive direction of the xaxis, which we shall call S x, is then Sx=/integraldisplay/integraldisplay ¯Xdxdy=/integraldisplay/integraldisplay τzxdxdy or, using the relationship of Eqs (3.2) Sx=/integraldisplay/integraldisplay∂φ ∂ydxdy=/integraldisplay dx/integraldisplay∂φ ∂ydy=0 asφ=0 at the boundary.

However, we shallrequire a more exact deﬁnition since we shall be concerned with work done by bothforcesandmomentsandwiththeworkdonebyaforcewhenthebodyonwhichitactsis given a displacement which is not coincident with the line of action of the force. Consider the force, F, acting on a particle,A, in Fig. 4.1(a). If the particle is given a displacement, /Delta1, by some external agency so that it moves toA /primein a direction at anCh04-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 9 88 Virtual work and energy methods angleαto the line of action of F, the work, WF, done by Fis given by WF=F(/Delta1cosα) (4.1) or WF=(Fcosα)/Delta1 (4.2) We see therefore that the work done by the force, F, as the particle moves fromA to A/primemayberegardedaseithertheproductof Fandthecomponentof /Delta1inthedirection ofF(Eq. (4.1)) or as the product of the component of Fin the direction of /Delta1and/Delta1 (Eq. (4.2)). Now consider the couple (pure moment) in Fig. 4.1(b) and suppose that the couple is given a small rotation of θradians. The work done by each force Fis thenF(a/2)θ so that the total work done, WC, by the couple is WC=Fa 2θ+Fa 2θ=Faθ It follows that the work done, WM, by the pure moment, M, acting on the barAB in Fig. 4.1(c) as it is given a small rotation, θ,i s WM=Mθ (4.3) Notethatintheabovetheforce, F,andmoment, M,areinpositionbeforethedisplace- mentstakeplaceandarenotthecauseofthem.Also,inFig.4.1(a),thecomponentof /Delta1 paralleltothedirectionof Fisinthesamedirectionas F;ifithadbeenintheopposite direction the work done would have been negative. The same argument applies to the work done by the moment, M, where we see in Fig. 4.1(c) that the rotation, θ,i si n the same sense as M. Note also that if the displacement, /Delta1, had been perpendicular to the force, F, no work would have been done by F. Finallyitshouldberememberedthatworkisascalarquantitysinceitisnotassociated with direction (in Fig. 4.1(a) the force Fdoes work if the particle is moved in any direction).

It follows from Eq. (4.5) that the virtual work done by the forces, F, during the virtual displacement, /Delta1v, is zero. We can therefore state the principle of virtual work for a particle as follows: If a particle is in equilibrium under the action of a number of forces the total work done by the forces for a small arbitrary displacement of the particle is zero.

Suppose now that the rigid body is given a small, imaginary, that is virtual, displacement, /Delta1v(or a rotation or a combination of both), in some speciﬁed direction. The external and internal forces then do virtual work and the totalvirtual work done, W t, is the sum of the virtual work, We, done by the external forces and the virtual work, Wi, done by the internal forces.Thus Wt=We+Wi (4.6) Sincethebodyisrigid,alltheparticlesinthebodymovethroughthesamedisplacement,/Delta1 v,sothatthevirtualworkdoneonalltheparticlesisnumericallythesame.However, for a pair of adjacent particles, such as A 1and A2in Fig. 4.3, the self-equilibrating forcesareinoppositedirections,whichmeansthattheworkdoneonA 1isoppositein sign to the work done on A 2.

(iv) (RA+RC−W)/Delta1v+(RCL−Wa)θv=0( v) Equation (v) is valid for all values of /Delta1vandθvso that RA+RC−W=0RCL−Wa=0 which are the equations of equilibrium we would have obtained by resolving forcesvertically and taking moments aboutA. It is not being suggested here that the application of the principles of statics should be abandoned in favour of the principle of virtual work. The purpose of Example 4.1is to illustrate the application of a virtual displacement and the manner in which theprinciple is used. 4.2.3 Virtual work in a deformable body Instructuralanalysiswearenotgenerallyconcernedwithforcesactingonarigidbody.Structures and structural members deform under load, which means that if we assignavirtualdisplacementtoaparticularpointinastructure,notallpointsinthestructurewillsufferthesamevirtualdisplacementaswouldbethecaseifthestructurewererigid. This means that the virtual work produced by the internal forces is not zero as it is in therigidbodycase,sincethevirtualworkproducedbytheself-equilibratingforcesonadjacent particles does not cancel out. The total virtual work produced by applying avirtualdisplacementtoadeformablebodyacteduponbyasystemofexternalforcesistherefore given by Eq. (4.6). Ifthebodyisinequilibriumundertheactionoftheexternalforcesystemthenevery particleinthebodyisalsoinequilibrium.Therefore,fromtheprincipleofvirtualwork,thevirtualworkdonebytheforcesactingontheparticleiszeroirrespectiveofwhetherthe forces are external or internal. It follows that, since the virtual work is zero for allparticles in the body, it is zero for the complete body and Eq. (4.6) becomes W e+Wi=0 (4.8) Notethatintheaboveargumentonlytheconditionsofequilibriumandtheconceptofwork are employed. Equation (4.8) therefore does not require the deformable body tobelinearlyelastic(i.e.itneednotobeyHooke’slaw)sothattheprincipleofvirtualworkmay be applied to any body or structure that is rigid, elastic or plastic. The principledoes require that displacements, whether real or imaginary, must be small, so that wemayassumethatexternalandinternalforcesareunchangedinmagnitudeanddirectionCh04-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 9 94 Virtual work and energy methods during the displacements. In addition the virtual displacements must be compatible with the geometry of the structure and the constraints that are applied, such as thoseat a support. The exception is the situation we have in Example 4.1 where we applya virtual displacement at a support. This approach is valid since we include the workdone by the support reactions in the total virtual work equation. 4.2.4 Work done by internal force systems Thecalculationoftheworkdonebyanexternalforceisstraightforwardinthatitisthe product of the force and the displacement of its point of application in its own line ofaction(Eqs(4.1),(4.2)or(4.3))whereasthecalculationoftheworkdonebyaninternalforce system during a displacement is much more complicated.

For beams of non-circular cross-section, Iois replaced by a torsion constant, J, which, for many practical beam sections is determined empirically. Hinges In some cases it is convenient to impose a virtual rotation, θv, at some point in a structural member where, say, the actual bending moment is MA. The internal virtual work done by MAis thenMAθv(see Eq. (4.3)); physically this situation is equivalent to inserting a hinge at the point. Sign of internal virtual work Sofarwehavederivedexpressionsforinternalworkwithoutconsideringwhetheritispositive or negative in relation to external virtual work. Supposethatthestructuralmember,AB,inFig.4.6(a)is,say,amemberofatrussand that it is in equilibrium under the action of two externally applied axial tensile loads, P; clearly the internal axial, that is normal, force at any section of the member is P. Supposenowthatthememberisgivenavirtualextension, δv,suchthatBmovestoB/prime. Then the virtual work done by the applied load, P, is positive since the displacement, δv, is in the same direction as its line of action. However, the virtual work done by the internal force, N(=P), is negative since the displacement of B is in the opposite direction to its line of action; in other words work is done onthe member.Thus, from Eq.

(4.23) is generally applicable. 4.2.5 Virtual work due to external force systems Sofarinourdiscussionwehaveonlyconsideredthevirtualworkproducedbyexternallyapplied concentrated loads. For completeness we must also consider the virtual workproduced by moments, torques and distributed loads. In Fig. 4.7 a structural member carries a distributed load, w(x), and at a particular point a concentrated load, W, a moment, Mand a torque, T. Suppose that at the point a virtual displacement is imposed that has translational components, /Delta1 v,yand/Delta1v,x, parallel to the yandxaxes, respectively, and rotational components, θvandφv, in the yxandzyplanes, respectively. If we consider a small element, δx, of the member at the point, the distributed load may be regarded as constant over the length δxand acting, in effect, as a concentrated loadw(x)δx. The virtual work, we, done by the complete external force system is therefore given by we=W/Delta1v,y+P/Delta1v,x+Mθv+Tφv+/integraldisplay Lw(x)/Delta1v,ydx For a structure comprising a number of load positions, the total external virtual workdone is then W e=/summationdisplay/bracketleftbigg W/Delta1v,y+P/Delta1v,x+Mθv+Tφv+/integraldisplay Lw(x)/Delta1v,ydx/bracketrightbigg (4.24) InEq.(4.24)thereneednotbeacompletesetofexternalloadsappliedateveryloadingpoint so, in fact, the summation is for the appropriate number of loads.

However, the actualforcesarenotrelatedtothevirtualdisplacementsinanywaysince,aswehaveseen,themagnitudes and directions of the actual forces are unchanged by the virtual displace-mentssolongasthedisplacementsaresmall.Thustheprincipleofvirtualworkappliesforanyset of forces in equilibrium and anyset of displacements. Equally, therefore, we could specify that the forces are a set of virtual forces in equilibrium and that the displacements are actual displacements. Therefore, instead of relating actual externalandinternalforcesystemsthroughvirtualdisplacements,wecanrelateactualexternaland internal displacements through virtual forces. If we apply a virtual force system to a deformable body it will induce an internal virtualforcesystemwhichwillmovethroughtheactualdisplacements;internalvirtualwork will therefore be produced. In this case, for example, Eq. (4.10) becomes w i,N=/integraldisplay LNvεAdx in which Nvis the internal virtual normal force and εAis the actual strain. Then, for a linear system, in which the actual internal normal force is NA,εA=NA/EA, so that for a structure comprising a number of members the total internal virtual work due to a virtual normal force is Wi,N=/summationdisplay/integraldisplay LNvNA EAdx which is identical to Eq. (4.12). Equations (4.17), (4.21) and (4.22) may be shown to apply to virtual force systems in a similar manner. 4.3 Applications of the principle of virtual work We have now seen that the principle of virtual work may be used either in the form of imposed virtual displacements or in the form of imposed virtual forces. GenerallyCh04-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 9 4.3 Applications of the principle of virtual work 101 theformerapproach,aswesawinExample4.1,isusedtodetermineforces,whilethe latter is used to obtain displacements. For statically determinate structures the use of virtual displacements to determine force systems is a relatively trivial use of the principle although problems of this typeprovide a useful illustration of the method. The real power of this approach lies in itsapplication to the solution of statically indeterminate structures. However, the use ofvirtual forces is particularly useful in determining actual displacements of structures. We shall illustrate both approaches by examples. Example 4.2 DeterminethebendingmomentatthepointBinthesimplysupportedbeamABCshownin Fig. 4.8(a). WedeterminedthesupportreactionsforthisparticularbeaminExample4.1.Inthis example,however,weareinterestedintheactualinternalmoment, M B,atthepointof application of the load. We must therefore impose a virtual displacement which willrelatetheinternalmomentatBtotheappliedloadandwhichwillexcludeotherunknownexternalforcessuchasthesupportreactions,andunknowninternalforcesystemssuchas the bending moment distribution along the length of the beam. Therefore, if weimaginethatthebeamishingedatBandthatthelengthsABandBCarerigid,avirtualdisplacement, /Delta1 v,B, at B will result in the displaced shape shown in Fig. 4.8(b). NotethatthesupportreactionsatAandCdonoworkandthattheinternalmoments inAB and BC do no work becauseAB and BC are rigid links.

(ii) we have Waβ=MBL bβ which gives MB=Wab L which is the result we would have obtained by calculating the moment of RC(=Wa/L from Example 4.1) about B.

Further, the triangle BCDwill rotate as a rigid body about D to B /primeC/primeD as shown in Fig. 4.9(b). The horizontal displacement of C, /Delta1C, is then given by /Delta1C=4α while /Delta1v,B=3α Hence /Delta1C=4/Delta1v,B 3(i) Equating the external virtual work done by the 30kN load to the internal virtual workdone by the force, F BA, in the member,AB, we have (see Eq. (4.23) and Fig. 4.6) 30/Delta1C=FBA/Delta1v,B (ii) Substituting for /Delta1C from Eq. (i) in Eq. (ii), 30×4 3/Delta1v,B=FBA/Delta1v,B Whence FBA=+40kN (i.e. FBAis tensile) Intheaboveweare,ineffect,assigningapositive(i.e.tensile)signto FBAbyimposing a virtual extension on the memberAB. The actual sign of FBAis then governed by the sign of the external virtual work. Thus,ifthe30kNloadhadbeenintheoppositedirectionto /Delta1Ctheexternalworkdone would have been negative, so that FBAwould be negative and therefore compressive. This situation can be veriﬁed by inspection. Alternatively, for the loading as shown in Fig. 4.9(a), a contraction inAB would have implied that FBAwas compressive. In this case DC would have rotated in an anticlockwise sense, /Delta1Cwould have been in the opposite direction to the 30kN load so that the external virtual work done wouldbe negative, resulting in a negative value for the compressive force F BA;FBAwould thereforebetensileasbefore.Notealsothatthe10kNloadatDdoesnoworksinceDremains undisplaced. We shall now consider problems involving the use of virtual forces. Generally we shall require the displacement of a particular point in a structure, so that if we apply avirtualforcetothestructureatthepointandinthedirectionoftherequireddisplacementthe external virtual work done will be the product of the virtual force and the actualdisplacement,whichmaythenbeequatedtotheinternalvirtualworkproducedbytheinternalvirtualforcesystemmovingthroughactualdisplacements.Sincethechoiceofthevirtualforceisarbitrary,wemaygiveitanyconvenientvalue;thesimplesttypeofCh04-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 9 104 Virtual work and energy methods virtualforceisthereforeaunitloadandthemethodthenbecomesthe unitloadmethod (see also Section 5.5).

Further, energy methods provide comparatively simple solutions fordeﬂection problems which are not readily solved by more elementary means. Generally, as we shall see, modern analysis 1uses the methods of total complemen- tary energy andtotal potential energy. Either method may be employed to solve a particular problem, although as a general rule deﬂections are more easily found usingcomplementary energy, and forces by potential energy. Although energy methods are applicable to a wide range of structural problems and may even be used as indirect methods of forming equations of equilibrium orcompatibility, 1,2we shall be concerned in this chapter with the solution of deﬂection problems and the analysis of statically indeterminate structures.We shall also includesomemethodsrestrictedtothesolutionoflinearsystems,i.e.the unitloadmethod,the principle of superposition and thereciprocal theorem. 5.1 Strain energy and complementary energy Figure 5.1(a) shows a structural member subjected to a steadily increasing load P.As thememberextends,theload Pdoesworkandfromthelawofconservationofenergy thisworkisstoredinthememberas strainenergy.Atypicalload–deﬂectioncurvefora memberpossessingnon-linearelasticcharacteristicsisshowninFig.5.1(b).ThestrainenergyUproduced by a load Pand corresponding extension yis then U=/integraldisplay y 0Pdy (5.1)Ch05-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 10 112 Energy methods Fig. 5.1 (a) Strain energy of a member subjected to simple tension; (b) load–deﬂection curve for a nonlinearly elastic member. and is clearly represented by the area OBD under the load–deﬂection curve.

It will be observed that the latter of Eqs (5.5) is in the form of what is commonly known as Castigliano’s ﬁrst theorem, in which the differential of the strain energy U of a structure with respect to a load is equated to the deﬂection of the load. To bemathematically correct, however, it is the differential of the complementary energy C which should be equated to deﬂection (compare Eqs (5.3) and (5.4)). 5.2 The principle of the stationary value of the total complementary energy Consideranelasticsysteminequilibriumsupportingforces P1,P2,...,Pnwhichpro- duce real corresponding displacements /Delta11,/Delta12,...,/Delta1n.

From the principle of virtual work −/integraldisplay volydP+n/summationdisplay r=1/Delta1rδPr=0 (5.6) Comparing Eq. (5.6) with Eq.

Let us suppose that we require to ﬁnd the deﬂection /Delta1 2of the load P2in the sim- ple pin-jointed framework consisting, say, of kmembers and supporting loads P1, P2,...,Pn,asshowninFig.5.3.FromEqs(5.8)thetotalcomplementaryenergyofthe framework is given by C=k/summationdisplay i=1/integraldisplayFi 0λidFi−n/summationdisplay r=1/Delta1rPr (5.9)Ch05-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 10 5.3 Application to deﬂection problems 115 Fig. 5.3 Determination of the deﬂection of a point on a framework by the method of complementary energy. where λiis the extension of the ith member, Fithe force in the ith member and /Delta1r thecorrespondingdisplacementofthe rthloadPr.Fromtheprincipleofthestationary value of the total complementary energy ∂C ∂P2=k/summationdisplay i=1λi∂Fi ∂P2−/Delta12=0 (5.10) from which /Delta12=k/summationdisplay i=1λi∂Fi ∂P2(5.11) Equation(5.10)isseentobeidenticaltotheprincipleofvirtualforcesinwhichvirtual forces δFandδPactthroughrealdisplacements λand/Delta1.Clearlythepartialderivatives with respect to P2of the constant loads P1,P2,...,Pnvanish, leaving the required deﬂection /Delta12as the unknown.

The complementary energy of the reaction at A and the vertical reaction at B is therefore zero, since both of their corresponding displacements are zero. If weexamineEq.(5.11)wenotethat λ iistheextensionofthe ithmemberoftheframework due to the applied loads P1,P2,...,Pn. Therefore, the loads Fiin the substitution for λiinEq.(5.11)arethosecorrespondingtotheloads P1,P2,...,Pn.Theterm ∂Fi/∂P2 in Eq. (5.11) represents the rate of change of FiwithP2and is calculated by applying theloadP2totheunloaded frameanddeterminingthecorrespondingmemberloadsin termsofP2.Thisprocedureindicatesamethodforobtainingthedisplacementofeither a point on the frame in a direction not coincident with the line of action of a load or,in fact, a point such as C which carries no load at all.We place at the point and in therequireddirectiona ﬁctitiousordummyload,say P f,theoriginalloadsbeingremoved. The loads in the members due to Pfare then calculated and ∂F/∂Pfobtained for each member. Substitution in Eq. (5.11) produces the required deﬂection. It must be pointed out that it is not absolutely necessary to remove the actual loads during the application of Pf. The force in each member would then be calculated in terms of the actual loading and Pf.Fifollows by substituting Pf=0 and ∂Fi/∂Pfis found by differentiation with respect to Pf. Obviously the two approaches yield the same expressions for Fiand∂Fi/∂Pf, although the latter is arithmetically clumsier.

The trueforce system is, as we demonstrated in Section 5.2, the one satisfying the conditionsofcompatibilityofdisplacementoftheelasticstructureor,alternatively,thatforwhichthe total complementary energy has a stationary value. We shall apply the principleto a variety of statically indeterminate structures, beginning with the relatively simplesingly redundant pin-jointed frame shown in Fig. 5.8 in which each member has thesame value of the product AE. The ﬁrst step is to choose the redundant member.

The intention here is not to suggest that continuous beams are best or most readily solved by the energy method; the moment distribution method produces a more rapid solution, especially for beams in which the degree of redundancy is large. Insteadthe purpose is to demonstrate the versatility and power of energy methods in theirreadysolutionofawiderangeofstructuralproblems.Acompleteinvestigationofthisversatilityisimpossiblehereduetorestrictionofspace;infact,wholebookshavebeendevoted to this topic. We therefore limit our analysis to problems peculiar to the ﬁeldof aircraft structures with which we are primarily concerned. The remaining portionof this section is therefore concerned with the solution of frames and rings possessingvarying degrees of redundancy. The frameworks we considered in the earlier part of this section and in Section 5.3 comprised members capable of resisting direct forces only. Of a more generaltype are composite frameworks in which some or all of the members resist bendingand shear loads in addition to direct loads. It is usual, however, except for the thin-walledstructuresinPartBofthisbook,toignoredeﬂectionsproducedbyshearforces. We only consider, therefore, bending and direct force contributions to the internal complementary energy of such structures. The method of analysis is illustrated in thefollowing example.

The displacement of some point in thereleasedstructureisthendeterminedby,say,theunitloadmethod.Theactualloadsonthestructureareremovedandunknownforcesappliedtothepointswherethestructurehas been released; the displacement at the point produced by these unknown forcesCh05-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 10 140 Energy methods must, from compatibility, be the same as that in the released structure. The unknown forces are then obtained; this approach is known as the ﬂexibility method . Example 5.8 Determine the forces in the members of the truss shown in Fig. 5.20(a); the cross-sectional area A, andYoung’s modulus E, are the same for all members. The truss in Fig. 5.20(a) is clearly externally statically determinate but has a degree of internal statical indeterminacy equal to 1. We therefore release the truss so that itbecomes statically determinate by ‘cutting’one of the members, say BD, as shown inFig. 5.20(b). Due to the actual loads ( Pin this case) the cut ends of the member BD willseparateorcometogether,dependingonwhethertheforceinthemember(beforeit was cut) was tensile or compressive; we shall assume that it was tensile. We are assuming that the truss is linearly elastic so that the relative displacement of the cut ends of the member BD (in effect the movement of B and D away fromor towards each other along the diagonal BD) may be found using, say, the unit loadmethod. Thus we determine the forces F a,j, in the members produced by the actual loads.WethenapplyequalandoppositeunitloadstothecutendsofthememberBDasshown in Fig 5.20(c) and calculate the forces, F 1,jin the members. The displacement of B relative to D, /Delta1BD, is then given by /Delta1BD=n/summationdisplay j=1Fa,jF1,jLj AE(see Eq.

Having determined XBD, the actualforcesinthemembersofthecompletetrussmaybecalculatedby,say,themethod of joints or the method of sections. In Eq.

Finally, we note that the cut member BD is included in the calculation of the displacements in the released structure since its deformation, under a unit load, contributes to aBD.

(5.23) may be written δU−δn/summationdisplay r=1Pr/Delta1r=0 or, from Eq. (5.22) δ(U+V)=0 (5.24) Thus, the total potential energy of an elastic system has a stationary value for all small displacements if the system is in equilibrium. It may also be shown that if thestationaryvalueisaminimumtheequilibriumisstable.Aqualitativedemonstrationofthisfactissufﬁcientforourpurposes,althoughmathematicalproofsexist. 1InFig.5.24 the positionsA, B and C of a particle correspond to different equilibrium states. Thetotal potential energy of the particle in each of its three positions is proportional toits height habove some arbitrary datum, since we are considering a single particle for which the strain energy is zero. Clearly at each position the ﬁrst order variation,∂(U+V)/∂u, is zero (indicating equilibrium), but only at B where the total potential energy is a minimum is the equilibrium stable. At A and C we have unstable andneutral equilibrium, respectively. Fig. 5.24 States of equilibrium of a particle.Ch05-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 10 148 Energy methods Tosummarize, theprincipleofthestationaryvalueofthetotalpotentialenergy may be stated as: The total potential energy of an elastic system has a stationary value for all small displacementswhenthesystemisinequilibrium;further,theequilibriumisstableif the stationary value is a minimum. This principle may often be used in the approximate analysis of structures where an exact analysis does not exist. We shall illustrate the application of the principle inExample 5.11 below, where we shall suppose that the displaced form of the beam isunknown and must be assumed; this approach is called the Rayleigh–Ritzmethod. Example 5.11 Determinethedeﬂectionofthemid-spanpointofthelinearlyelastic,simplysupportedbeam shown in Fig. 5.25; the ﬂexural rigidity of the beam is EI.

From Eq. (i) we see that v=0 whenz=0 andz=Land that v=vBwhenz=L/2. Also d v/dz=0 whenz=L/2 so that the displacement function satisﬁes the boundary conditions of the beam.

Further, the approximate displacement is less than theexactdisplacementsince,byassumingadisplacedshape,wehave,ineffect,forcedthebeam into taking that shape by imposing restraint; the beam is therefore stiffer. 5.9 Principle of superposition An extremely useful principle employed in the analysis of linearly elastic structures is that of superposition. The principle states that if the displacements at all points inan elastic body are proportional to the forces producing them, i.e. the body is linearlyelastic, the effect on such a body of a number of forces is the sum of the effects of theforcesappliedseparately.Weshallmakeimmediateuseoftheprincipleinthederivationof the reciprocal theorem in the following section. 5.10 The reciprocal theorem The reciprocal theorem is an exceptionally powerful method of analysis of linearly elastic structures and is accredited in turn to Maxwell, Betti and Rayleigh. However,Ch05-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 10 150 Energy methods Fig. 5.26 Linearly elastic body subjected to loads P1,P2,P3,… ,Pn. before we establish the theorem we ﬁrst consider a useful property of linearly elas- tic systems resulting from the principle of superposition. The principle enables us toexpress the deﬂection of any point in a structure in terms of a constant coefﬁcient andtheappliedloads.Forexample,aload P 1appliedatapoint1inalinearlyelasticbody will produce a deﬂection /Delta11at the point given by /Delta11=a11P1 inwhichthe inﬂuence orﬂexibility coeffcient a11isdeﬁnedasthedeﬂectionatthepoint 1 in the direction of P1, produced by a unit load at the point 1 applied in the direction ofP1.Clearly,ifthebodysupportsasystemofloadssuchasthoseshowninFig.5.26, each of the loads P1,P2,… ,Pnwill contribute to the deﬂection at the point 1. Thus, thecorresponding deﬂection /Delta11at the point 1 (i.e. the total deﬂection in the direction ofP1produced by all the loads) is then /Delta11=a11P1+a12P2+···+a1nPn wherea12isthedeﬂectionatthepoint1inthedirectionof P1,producedbyaunitload at the point 2 in the direction of the load P2and so on. The corresponding deﬂections at the points of application of the complete system of loads are then /Delta11=a11P1+a12P2+a13P3+···+a1nPn /Delta12=a21P1+a22P2+a23P3+···+a2nPn /Delta13=a31P1+a32P2+a33P3+···+a3nPn ... /Delta1n=an1P1+an2P2+an3P3+···+annPn⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎭(5.25) or, in matrix form ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩/Delta1 1 /Delta12 /Delta13 ... /Delta1n⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎭=⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣a 11a12a13…a1n a21a22a23…a2n a31a32a33…a3n ............ a n1an2an3…ann⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩P 1 P2 P3 ...

(5.26) results from the additional work donebyP1asitisdisplacedthroughafurtherdistance a12P2bytheactionof P2.Ifwe now remove the loads and apply P2followed by P1we have U2=P2 2(a22P2)+P1 2(a11P1)+P2(a21P1) (5.27) By the principle of superposition the strain energy stored is independent of the order in which the loads are applied. Hence U1=U2 and it follows that a12=a21 (5.28) Thus in its simplest form the reciprocal theorem states that: The deﬂection at a point 1 in a given direction due to a unit load at a point 2 in a second direction is equal to the deﬂection at the point 2 in the second direction dueto a unit load at the point 1 in the ﬁrst direction. Inasimilarmanner,wederivetherelationshipbetweenmomentsandrotations,thus: Therotationatapoint1duetoaunitmomentatapoint2isequaltotherotationat the point 2 produced by a unit moment at the point 1.Finally, we have: The rotation at a point 1 due to a unit load at a point 2 is numerically equal to the deﬂectionatthepoint2inthedirectionoftheunitloadduetoaunitmomentatthe point 1.

The initial deﬂected shape of the cantilever is plotted as shown in Fig. 5.27(a) and the deﬂections at D and E produced by the 40 N load determined. The solution then proceeds as follows. Deﬂection at D due to 40N load at C =−1.4mm. Hence from the reciprocal theorem the deﬂection at C due to a 40N load at D=−1.4mm. It follows that the deﬂection at C due to a 30N load at D =−3 4×1.4=−1.05mm. Similarly the deﬂection at C due to a 10N load at E =−1 4×2.4=−0.6mm. Therefore,thetotaldeﬂectionatC,producedbythe30and10Nloadsactingsimul- taneously (Fig. 5.27(b)), is −1.05−0.6=−1.65mm from which the angular rotation of the beam at B, θB,i sg i v e nb y θB=tan−11.65 300=tan−10.0055 or θB=0◦19/prime Example 5.13 AnelasticmemberispinnedtoadrawingboardatitsendsAandB.Whenamoment M isappliedatA,Arotates θA,Brotates θBandthecentredeﬂects δ1.Thesamemoment M appliedtoBrotatesB, θCanddeﬂectsthecentrethrough δ2.Findthemomentinduced atAwhenaload Wisappliedtothecentreinthedirectionofthemeasureddeﬂections, bothA and B being restrained against rotation.

Finally, the rotation atA due to MAat A is, from Fig. 5.28(a) and (c) θA(c),3=MA MθA (iii) The total rotation atA produced by MAatA,Wat C andMBat B is, from Eqs (i), (ii) and (iii) θA(c),1+θA(c),2+θA(c),3=MB MθB+W Mδ1+MA MθA=0( i v ) since the endA is restrained from rotation.

However, a linear temperature gradient across the beam section causes the upper ﬁbres of the beam toexpand more than the lower ones, producing a bending strain as shown in Fig. 5.30without the associated bending stresses, again provided no constraints are present. Consider an element of the beam of depth hand length δzsubjected to a linear temperature gradient over its depth, as shown in Fig. 5.31(a). The upper surface Fig. 5.29 Expansion of beam due to uniform temperature. Fig. 5.30 Bending of beam due to linear temperature gradient.

Thus from Fig. 5.31(b) R δz=R+h δz(1+αt) giving R=h/αt (5.29) Also δθ=δz/R so that, from Eq. (5.29) δθ=δzαt h(5.30) We may now apply the principle of the stationary value of the total complementary energy in conjunction with the unit load method to determine the deﬂection /Delta1Te, due to the temperature of any point of the beam shown in Fig. 5.30. We have seen that the above principle is equivalent to the application of the principle of virtual workwherevirtualforcesactthroughrealdisplacements.Therefore,wemayspecifythatthedisplacements are those produced by the temperature gradient while the virtual forcesystem is the unit load. Thus, the deﬂection /Delta1 Te,Bof the tip of the beam is found by writing down the increment in total complementary energy caused by the applicationof a virtual unit load at B and equating the resulting expression to zero (see Eqs (5.7)and (5.12)).Thus δC=/integraldisplay LM1dθ−1/Delta1Te,B=0 or /Delta1Te,B=/integraldisplay LM1dθ (5.31) whereM1is the bending moment at any section due to the unit load.

These components are usually continuous and therefore, theoret- ically, possess an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom and redundancies. Analysisis then only possible if the actual structure is replaced by an idealized approximationor model. This procedure is discussed to some extent in Chapter 20 where we notethat the greater the simpliﬁcation introduced by the idealization the less complex butmore inaccurate becomes the analysis. In aircraft design, where structural weight isof paramount importance, an accurate knowledge of component loads and stresses isessential so that at some stage in the design these must be calculated as accurately aspossible. This accuracy may only be achieved by considering an idealized structurewhich closely represents the actual structure. Standard methods of structural analysisare inadequate for coping with the necessary degree of complexity in such idealizedstructures. It was this situation which led, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, to thedevelopment of matrix methods of analysis and at the same time to the emergence of high-speed, electronic, digital computers. Conveniently, matrix methods are ideallysuitedforexpressingstructuraltheoryandforexpressingthetheoryinaformsuitablefor numerical solution by computer. Astructuralproblemmaybeformulatedineitheroftwodifferentways.Oneapproach proceeds with the displacements of the structure as the unknowns, the internal forcesthen follow from the determination of these displacements, while in the alternativeapproach forces are treated as being initially unknown. In the language of matrixmethods these two approaches are known as the stiffness(ordisplacement ) method and theﬂexibility (orforce) method, respectively. The most widely used of these two methods is the stiffness method and for this reason, we shall concentrate on this par-ticular approach. Argyris and Kelsey, 1however, showed that complete duality exists betweenthetwomethodsinthattheformofthegoverningequationsisthesamewhetherthey are expressed in terms of displacements or forces. Generally, actual structures must be idealized to some extent before they become amenabletoanalysis.Examplesofsomesimpleidealizationsandtheireffectonstruc-turalanalysisarepresentedinChapter20foraircraftstructures.Outsidetherealmsofaeronauticalengineeringtherepresentationofatrussgirderbyapin-jointedframeworkisawell-knownexampleoftheidealizationofwhatareknownas‘skeletal’structures.SuchstructuresareassumedtoconsistofanumberofelementsjoinedatpointscalledCh06-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 13 6.1 Notation 169 nodes.Thebehaviourofeachelementmaybedeterminedbybasicmethodsofstructural analysisandhencethebehaviourofthecompletestructureisobtainedbysuperposition.Operations such as this are easily carried out by matrix methods as we shall see laterin this chapter. A more difﬁcult type of structure to idealize is the continuum structure; in this category are dams, plates, shells and, obviously, aircraft fuselage and wing skins.

Hence Fx,1=ku1 and from equilibrium we see that Fx,2=−Fx,1=−ku1 (6.3) which indicates that Fx,2has become a reactive force in the opposite direction to Fx,1. Secondly, we take the reverse case where u1=0 andu2=u2and obtain Fx,2=ku2=−Fx,1 (6.4) Fig. 6.1 Determination of stiffness matrix for a single spring.Ch06-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 13 6.3 Stiffness matrix for two elastic springs in line 171 By superposition of these two conditions we obtain relationships between the applied forces and the nodal displacements for the state when u1=u1andu2=u2.Thus Fx,1=ku1−ku2 Fx,2=−ku1+ku2/bracerightbigg (6.5) Writing Eq.

The notation and sign convention for the forces and nodal displacementsare identical to those speciﬁed in Section 6.1. First let us suppose that u 1=u1andu2=u3=0. By comparison with the single spring case we have Fx,1=kau1=−Fx,2 (6.8) but, in addition, Fx,3=0 sinceu2=u3=0. Secondly, we put u1=u3=0 andu2=u2. Clearly, in this case, the movement of node 2 takes place against the combined spring stiffnesses kaandkb. Hence Fx,2=(ka+kb)u2 Fx,1=−kau2,Fx,3=−kbu2/bracerightbigg (6.9) Hence the reactive force Fx,1(=−kau2) is not directly affected by the fact that node 2 isconnectedtonode3,butisdeterminedsolelybythedisplacementofnode2.Similarconclusions are drawn for the reactive force F x,3. Finally, we set u1=u2=0,u3=u3and obtain Fx,3=kbu3=−Fx,2 Fx,1=0/bracerightbigg (6.10) Fig. 6.2 Stiffness matrix for a two-spring system.Ch06-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 13 172 Matrix methods Superimposing these three displacement states we have, for the condition u1=u1, u2=u2,u3=u3 Fx,1=kau1−kau2 Fx,2=−kau1+(ka+kb)u2−kbu3 Fx,3=−kbu2+kbu3⎫ ⎬ ⎭(6.11) Writing Eqs (6.11) in matrix form gives ⎧ ⎨ ⎩Fx,1 Fx,2 Fx,3⎫ ⎬ ⎭=⎡⎣k a−ka0 −kaka+kb−kb 0 −kbkb⎤⎦⎧ ⎨ ⎩u 1 u2 u3⎫ ⎬ ⎭(6.12) Comparison of Eqs (6.12) with Eq. (6.1) shows that the stiffness matrix [ K] of this two-spring system is [K]=⎡⎣k a−ka0 −kaka+kb−kb 0 −kbkb⎤⎦ (6.13) Equation (6.13) is a symmetric matrix of order 3 ×3. It is important to note that the order of a stiffness matrix may be predicted from a knowledgeofthenumberofnodalforcesanddisplacements.Forexample,Eq.(6.7)isa 2×2 matrix connecting twonodal forces with twonodal displacements; Eq. (6.13) is a3×3matrixrelating threenodalforcesto threenodaldisplacements.Wededucethat astiffnessmatrixforastructureinwhich nnodalforcesrelateto nnodaldisplacements willbeoforder n×n.Theorderofthestiffnessmatrixdoesnot,however,bearadirect relationtothenumberofnodesinastructuresinceitispossibleformorethanoneforceto be acting at any one node. Sofarwehavebuiltupthestiffnessmatricesforthesingle-andtwo-springassemblies byconsideringvariousstatesofdisplacementineachcase.Suchaprocesswouldclearlybecome tedious for more complex assemblies involving a large number of springs sothat a shorter, alternative, procedure is desirable. From our remarks in the precedingparagraph and by reference to Eq. (6.2) we could have deduced at the outset of theanalysis that the stiffness matrix for the two-spring assembly would be of the form [K]=⎡ ⎣k 11k12k13 k21k22k23 k31k32k33⎤⎦ (6.14) The element k 11of this matrix relates the force at node 1 to the displacement at node 1 and so on. Hence, remembering the stiffness matrix for the single spring (Eq. (6.7)) we may write down the stiffness matrix for an elastic element connecting nodes 1 and2 in a structure as [K 12]=/bracketleftbigg k11k12 k21k22/bracketrightbigg (6.15) and for the element connecting nodes 2 and 3 as [K23]=/bracketleftbigg k22k23 k32k33/bracketrightbigg (6.16)Ch06-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 13 6.3 Stiffness matrix for two elastic springs in line 173 Inourtwo-springsystemthestiffnessofthespringjoiningnodes1and2is kaandthat of the spring joining nodes 2 and 3 is kb.Therefore, by comparison with Eq. (6.7), we may rewrite Eqs (6.15) and (6.16) as [K12]=/bracketleftbigg ka−ka −kaka/bracketrightbigg [K23]=/bracketleftbigg kb−kb −kbkb/bracketrightbigg (6.17) Substituting in Eq. (6.14) gives [K]=⎡ ⎣ka−ka0 −kaka+kb−kb 0 −kbkb⎤⎦ whichisidenticaltoEq.(6.13).Weseethatonlythe k 22term(linkingtheforceatnode 2 to the displacement at node 2) receives contributions from both springs.This results fromthefactthatnode2isdirectlyconnectedtobothnodes1and3whilenodes1and3areeachjoineddirectlyonlytonode2.Also,theelements k 13andk31of[K]arezero since nodes 1 and 3 are not directly connected and are therefore not affected by eachother’s displacement. Theformationofastiffnessmatrixforacompletestructurethusbecomesarelatively simple matter of the superposition of individual or element stiffness matrices. Theprocedure may be summarized as follows: terms of the form k iion the main diagonal consist of the sum of the stiffnesses of all the structural elements meeting at node i while off-diagonal terms of the form kijconsist of the sum of the stiffnesses of all the elements connecting node ito nodej. Anexaminationofthestiffnessmatrixrevealsthatitpossessescertainproperties.For example,thesumoftheelementsinanycolumniszero,indicatingthattheconditionsofequilibriumaresatisﬁed.Also,thenon-zerotermsareconcentratedneartheleadingdiagonal while all the terms in the leading diagonal are positive; the latter propertyderives from the physical behaviour of any actual structure in which positive nodalforces produce positive nodal displacements. Further inspection of Eq.

Sufﬁcient boundary conditions must therefore be speciﬁedto enable the system to remain stable under load. In this particular problem we shalldemonstrate the solution procedure by assuming that node 1 is ﬁxed, i.e. u 1=0. The ﬁrst step is to rewrite Eq. (6.13) in partitioned form as ⎧ ⎨ ⎩Fx,1 Fx,2 Fx,3⎫ ⎬ ⎭=⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣k a...−ka0 ························ −ka...ka+kb−kb 0...−k bkb⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦⎧ ⎨ ⎩u 1=0 u2 u3⎫ ⎬ ⎭(6.18) In Eq. (6.18) Fx,1is the unknown reaction at node 1, u1andu2are unknown nodal displacements, while Fx,2andFx,3are known applied loads. Expanding Eq. (6.18) byCh06-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 13 174 Matrix methods matrix multiplication we obtain {Fx,1}=[−ka0]/braceleftbigg u2 u3/bracerightbigg/braceleftbigg Fx,2 Fx,3/bracerightbigg =/bracketleftbigg ka+kb−kb −kbkb/bracketrightbigg/braceleftbigg u2 u3/bracerightbigg (6.19) Inversion of the second of Eqs (6.19) gives u2andu3in terms of Fx,2andFx,3.

Obviously in a practical case a beam supports a variety of loads along its length and therefore such beams must be idealized intoa number of beam–elements for which the above condition holds. The idealization is accomplished by merely specifying nodes at points along the beam such that anyelementlyingbetweenadjacentnodescarries,atthemost,auniformshearandalinearlyvarying bending moment. For example, the beam of Fig. 6.7 would be idealized intobeam–elements 1–2, 2–3 and 3–4 for which the unknown nodal displacements arev 2,θ2,θ3,v4andθ4(v1=θ1=v3=0). Beams supporting distributed loads require special treatment in that the distributed load is replaced by a series of statically equivalent point loads at a selected number ofnodes. Clearly the greater the number of nodes chosen, the more accurate but morecomplicated and therefore time consuming will be the analysis.

The idealization maybe carried out in any number of different ways depending on such factors as the typeof problem, the accuracy of the solution required and the time and money available.For example, a coarseidealization involving a small number of large elements would provide a comparatively rapid but very approximate solution while a ﬁneidealization of small elements would produce more accurate results but would take longer andconsequently cost more. Frequently, graded meshes are used in which small elements areplacedinregionswherehighstressconcentrationsareexpected,forexamplearoundcut-outs and loading points. The principle is illustrated in Fig. 6.12 where a gradedsystem of triangular elements is used to examine the stress concentration around acircular hole in a ﬂat plate. Although the elements are connected at an inﬁnite number of points around their boundaries it is assumed that they are only interconnected at their corners or nodes.

In the case of distributed loads, equivalent nodal concentratedloads must be calculated. 4 The solution procedure is identical in outline to that described in the previous sec- tions for skeletal structures; the differences lie in the idealization of the structure intoﬁnite elements and the calculation of the stiffness matrix for each element.

Before discussing the solution of Eq. (7.20) for particular cases we shall establish boundary conditions for various types of edge support. 7.3.1 The simply supported edge Let us suppose that the edge x=0 of the thin plate shown in Fig. 7.10 is free to rotate but not to deﬂect. The edge is then said to be simply supported. The bending momentalong this edge must be zero and also the deﬂection w=0.Thus (w) x=0=0 and ( Mx)x=0=−D/parenleftbigg∂2w ∂x2+ν∂2w ∂y2/parenrightbigg x=0=0 The condition that w=0 along the edge x=0 also means that ∂w ∂y=∂2w ∂y2=0 Fig. 7.10 Plate of dimensions a×b.Ch07-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 15 230 Bending of thin plates along this edge.The above boundary conditions therefore reduce to (w)x=0=0/parenleftbigg∂2w ∂x2/parenrightbigg x=0=0 (7.23) 7.3.2 The built-in edge If the edge x=0 is built-in or ﬁrmly clamped so that it can neither rotate nor deﬂect, then, in addition to w, the slope of the middle plane of the plate normal to this edge must be zero.That is (w)x=0=0/parenleftbigg∂w ∂x/parenrightbigg x=0=0 (7.24) 7.3.3 The free edge Alongafreeedgetherearenobendingmoments,twistingmomentsorverticalshearing forces, so that if x=0 is the free edge then (Mx)x=0=0(Mxy)x=0=0(Qx)x=0=0 giving,inthisinstance,threeboundaryconditions.However,Kirchhoff(1850)showed that only two boundary conditions are necessary to obtain a solution of Eq. (7.20),and that the reduction is obtained by replacing the two requirements of zero twistingmomentandzeroshearforcebyasingleequivalentcondition.ThomsonandTait(1883)gave a physical explanation of how this reduction may be effected. They pointed outthatthehorizontalforcesystemequilibratingthetwistingmoment M xymaybereplaced along the edge of the plate by a vertical force system. Consider two adjacent elements δy1andδy2along the edge of the thin plate of Fig. 7.11.The twisting moment Mxyδy1on the element δy1may be replaced by forces Mxya distance δy1apart. Note that Mxy, being a twisting moment per unit length, has the dimensions of force. The twisting moment on the adjacent element δy2is [Mxy+(∂Mxy/∂y)δy]δy2. Again this may be replaced by forces Mxy+(∂Mxy/∂y)δy. At the common surface of the two adjacent elements there is now a resultant force (∂Mxy/∂y)δyor a vertical force per unit length of ∂Mxy/∂y. For the sign conven- tion forQxshown in Fig. 7.9 we have a statically equivalent vertical force per unit length of ( Qx−∂Mxy/∂y).The separate conditions for a free edge of ( Mxy)x=0=0 and (Qx)x=0=0 are therefore replaced by the equivalent condition /parenleftbigg Qx−∂Mxy ∂y/parenrightbigg x=0=0 or in terms of deﬂection /bracketleftbigg∂3w ∂x3+(2−ν)∂3w ∂x∂y2/bracketrightbigg x=0=0 (7.25)Ch07-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 15 7.3 Plates subjected to a distributed transverse load 231 Fig. 7.11 Equivalent vertical force system.

SinceMxy=−Myx, then resultant forces 2M xyact at each corner as shown and must be provided by external supports if the corners of the plate are not to move. The directions of these forcesare easily obtained if the deﬂected shape of the plate is known. For example, a thinplate simply supported along all four edges and uniformly loaded has ∂w/∂xpositive and numerically increasing, with increasing ynear the corner x=0,y=0. Hence ∂ 2w/∂x∂yis positive at this point and from Eq. (7.14) we see that Mxyis positive and Myxnegative; the resultant force 2 Mxyis therefore downwards. From symmetry the force at each remaining corner is also 2M xydownwards so that the tendency is for the corners of the plate to rise. Having discussed various types of boundary conditions we shall proceed to obtain the solution for the relatively simple case of a thin rectangular plate of dimensionsa×b, simply supported along each of its four edges and carrying a distributed load q(x,y).Wehaveshownthatthedeﬂectedformoftheplatemustsatisfythedifferential equation ∂ 4w ∂x4+2∂4w ∂x2∂y2+∂4w ∂y4=q(x,y) DCh07-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 15 232 Bending of thin plates with the boundary conditions (w)x=0,a=0/parenleftbigg∂2w ∂x2/parenrightbigg x=0,a=0 (w)y=0,b=0/parenleftbigg∂2w ∂y2/parenrightbigg x=0,b=0 Navier(1820)showedthattheseconditionsaresatisﬁedbyrepresentingthedeﬂection was an inﬁnite trigonometrical or Fourier series w=∞/summationdisplay m=1∞/summationdisplay n=1Amnsinmπx asinnπy b(7.27) in which mrepresents the number of half waves in the xdirection and nthe corres- ponding number in the ydirection.

The ﬁrst, in which the form of the deﬂected shape of the plate isknown,producesanexactsolution;thesecond,the Rayleigh–Ritz method,assumesan approximate deﬂected shape in the form of a series having a ﬁnite number of termschosen to satisfy the boundary conditions of the problem and also to give the kind ofdeﬂection pattern expected. InChapter5wesawthatthetotalpotentialenergyofastructuralsystemcomprised the internal or strain energy of the structural member, plus the potential energy of theapplied loading. We now proceed to derive expressions for these quantities for theloading cases considered in the preceding sections. 7.6.1 Strain energy produced by bending and twisting In thin plate analysis we are concerned with deﬂections normal to the loaded surfaceof the plate. These, as in the case of slender beams, are assumed to be primarily dueto bending action so that the effects of shear strain and shortening or stretching of themiddle plane of the plate are ignored. Therefore, it is sufﬁcient for us to calculatethestrainenergyproducedbybendingandtwistingonlyasthiswillbeapplicable,forthe reason of the above assumption, to all loading cases. It must be remembered thatweareonlyneglectingthecontributionsofshearanddirect strainsonthedeﬂectionof the plate; the stresses producing them must not be ignored.

Both are susceptible to failure by buckling at a buckling stress or critical stress, which is frequently below the limit of proportionality and seldomappreciably above the yield stress of the material. Clearly, for this type of structure,bucklingisthemostcriticalmodeoffailuresothatthepredictionofbucklingloadsofcolumns, thin plates and stiffened panels is extremely important in aircraft design. Inthis chapter we consider the buckling failure of all these structural elements and alsothe ﬂexural–torsional failure of thin-walled open tubes of low torsional rigidity. Twotypesofstructuralinstabilityarise: primaryandsecondary.Theformerinvolves the complete element, there being no change in cross-sectional area while the wave-length of the buckle is of the same order as the length of the element. Generally, solidand thick-walled columns experience this type of failure. In the latter mode, changesin cross-sectional area occur and the wavelength of the buckle is of the order of thecross-sectional dimensions of the element. Thin-walled columns and stiffened platesmay fail in this manner. 8.1 Euler buckling of columns Theﬁrstsigniﬁcantcontributiontothetheoryofthebucklingofcolumnswasmadeas earlyas1744byEuler.Hisclassicalapproachisstillvalid,andlikelytoremainso,forslendercolumnspossessingavarietyofendrestraints.Ourinitialdiscussionisthereforea presentation of the Euler theory for the small elastic deﬂection of perfect columns.However,weinvestigateﬁrstthenatureofbucklingandthedifferencebetweentheoryand practice.

We therefore require a precise deﬁnition of buckling load whichmay be used in our analysis of the perfect column.Ch08-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 15: 7 256 Columns Fig. 8.1 Deﬁnition of buckling load for a perfect column.

Hence PCR=π2EI l2(8.5) Other values of PCRcorresponding to n=2, 3,..., are PCR=4π2EI l2,9π2EI l2,... These higher values of buckling load cause more complex modes of buckling such as those shown in Fig. 8.3. The different shapes may be produced by applying externalrestraints to a very slender column at the points of contraﬂexure to prevent lateralmovement.

Further, suppose that the lateral load Fin Fig. 8.1 is removed. Since the column is perfectly straight, homogeneous and loaded exactly along its axis, it will sufferonly axial compression as Pis increased.This situation, theoretically, would continue until yielding of the material of the column occurred.

(8.8), depends only on the elastic modulus of the material of the column and the slenderness ratio l/r. For a given material the critical stress increases as the slenderness ratio decreases; i.e. as the column becomes shorter and thicker.A point is then reached when the critical stress is greater than theyield stress of the material so that Eq. (8.8) is no longer applicable. For mild steel thispoint occurs at a slenderness ratio of approximately 100, as shown in Fig. 8.6. Wethereforerequiresomealternativemeansofpredictingcolumnbehaviouratlowvaluesof slenderness ratio. ItwasassumedinthederivationofEq.(8.8)thatthestressesinthecolumnremained withintheelasticrangeofthematerialsothatthemodulusofelasticity E(=dσ/dε)was constant.

Since these changes take place outside the elastic limit of the material, we see, from our remarksin the previous paragraph, that the modulus of elasticity of the material in the areaA 1isEwhile that in A2isEt. The homogeneous column now behaves as if it were non-homogeneous, with the result that the stress distribution is changed to the formshown in Fig. 8.8(b); the linearity of the distribution follows from an assumption thatplane sections remain plane.

Hence the tangent modulus theorygives PCR=π2EtI l2e(8.20) and σCR=π2Et (le/r2)(8.21) By a similar argument, a reduction in Pcould result in a decrease in stress over the whole cross-section. The elastic modulus applies in this case and the critical load andstress are given by the standard Euler theory; namely, Eqs (8.7) and (8.8). InEq.(8.16), I 1andI2aretogethergreaterthan IwhileEisgreaterthan Et.Itfollows that the reduced modulus Eris greater than the tangent modulus Et. Consequently, buckling loads predicted by the reduced modulus theory are greater than bucklingloads derived from the tangent modulus theory, so that although we have speciﬁedtheoreticalloadingsituationswherethedifferenttheorieswouldapplytherestillremainsthe difﬁculty of deciding which should be used for design purposes. Extensiveexperimentscarriedoutonaluminiumalloycolumnsbytheaircraftindus- try in the 1940s showed that the actual buckling load was approximately equal to thetangent modulus load. Shanley (1947) explained that for columns with small imper-fections, an increase of axial load and bending occur simultaneously. He then showedanalytically that after the tangent modulus load is reached, the strain on the concavesideofthecolumnincreasesrapidlywhilethatontheconvexsidedecreasesslowly.Thelarge deﬂection corresponding to the rapid strain increase on the concave side, whichoccurs soon after the tangent modulus load is passed, means that it is only possible toexceedthetangentmodulusloadbyasmallamount.Itfollowsthatthebucklingloadofcolumnsisgivenmostaccuratelyforpracticalpurposesbythetangentmodulustheory. Empirical formulae have been used extensively to predict buckling loads, although in view of the close agreement between experiment and the tangent modulus theorytheywouldappearunnecessary.Severalformulaeareinuse;forexample,the Rankine, Straight-line andJohnson’s parabolic formulae are given in many books on elastic stability. 1Ch08-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 15: 7 8.3 Effect of initial imperfections 265 8.3 Effect of initial imperfections Obviouslyitisimpossibleinpracticetoobtainaperfectlystraighthomogeneouscolumn andtoensurethatitisexactlyaxiallyloaded.Anactualcolumnmaybebentwithsomeeccentricityofload.Suchimperfectionsinﬂuencetoalargedegreethebehaviourofthecolumnwhich,unliketheperfectcolumn,beginstobendimmediatelytheaxialloadisapplied.

Thisrelationship is valid if the deﬂections are small such that the slight change in geom-etry produced in the loaded beam has an insigniﬁcant effect on the loads themselves. This situation changes drastically when axial loads act simultaneously with the trans- verse loads.The internal moments, shear forces, stresses and deﬂections then becomedependentuponthemagnitudeofthedeﬂectionsaswellasthemagnitudeoftheexter-nal loads.

Thin plates under relatively small compressive loads are prone to buckle and so must be stiffened to prevent this. The determination of buckling loads for thin plates in isolation is relatively straightforward but when stiffened by ribs and stringers, theproblem becomes complex and frequently relies on an empirical solution. In fact itmay be the stiffeners which buckle before the plate and these, depending on theirgeometry, may buckle as a column or suffer local buckling of, say, a ﬂange. Inthischapterweshallpresentthetheoryforthedeterminationofbucklingloadsof ﬂatplatesandthenexaminesomeofthedifferentempiricalapproacheswhichvariousresearchers have suggested. In addition we shall investigate the particular case of ﬂatplates which, when reinforced by horizontal ﬂanges and vertical stiffeners, form thespars of aircraft wing structures; these are known as tension ﬁeld beams . 9.1 Buckling of thin plates A thin plate may buckle in a variety of modes depending upon its dimensions, the loading and the method of support. Usually, however, buckling loads are much lowerthan those likely to cause failure in the material of the plate. The simplest form ofbucklingariseswhencompressiveloadsareappliedtosimplysupportedoppositeedgesandtheunloadededgesarefree,asshowninFig.9.1.Athinplateinthisconﬁguration Fig. 9.1 Buckling of a thin ﬂat plate.Ch09-H6739.tex 25/1/2007 13: 56 9.1 Buckling of thin plates 295 behavesinexactlythesamewayasapin-endedcolumnsothatthecriticalloadisthat predicted by the Euler theory. Once this critical load is reached the plate is incapableofsupportinganyfurtherload.Thisisnotthecase,however,whentheunloadededgesaresupportedagainstdisplacementoutofthe xyplane.Buckling,forsuchplates,takes the form of a bulging displacement of the central region of the plate while the partsadjacent to the supported edges remain straight. These parts enable the plate to resisthigher loads; an important factor in aircraft design. Atthisstagewearenotconcernedwiththispost-bucklingbehaviour,butratherwith thepredictionofthecriticalloadwhichcausestheinitialbulgingofthecentralareaofthe plate. For the analysis we may conveniently employ the method of total potentialenergysincewehavealready,inChapter7,derivedexpressionsforstrainandpotentialenergycorrespondingtovariousloadandsupportconﬁgurations.Intheseexpressionsweassumedthatthedisplacementoftheplatecomprisesbendingdeﬂectionsonlyandthat these are small in comparison with the thickness of the plate. These restrictionstherefore apply in the subsequent theory. First we consider the relatively simple case of the thin plate of Fig. 9.1, loaded as shown, but simply supported along all four edges. We have seen in Chapter 7 that itstrue deﬂected shape may be represented by the inﬁnite double trigonometrical series w= ∞/summationdisplay m=1∞/summationdisplay n=1Amnsinmπx asinnπy b Also, the total potential energy of the plate is, from Eqs (7.37) and (7.45) U+V=1 2/integraldisplaya 0/integraldisplayb 0/bracketleftBigg D/braceleftBigg/parenleftbigg∂2w ∂x2+∂2w ∂y2/parenrightbigg2 −2(1−ν)/bracketleftBigg ∂2w ∂x2∂2w ∂y2−/parenleftbigg∂2w ∂x∂y/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg/bracerightBigg −Nx/parenleftbigg∂w ∂x/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg dxdy(9.1) TheintegrationofEq.(9.1)onsubstitutingfor wissimilartothoseintegrationscarried out in Chapter 7.Thus, by comparison with Eq.

(ii) of Example 7.3, where the displacement w would become inﬁnite for a negative (compressive) value of Nx equal to that of Eq. (9.3). We observe from Eq. (9.3) that each term in the inﬁnite series for displacement corresponds, as in the case of a column, to a different value of critical load (note, theproblemisaneigenvalueproblem).Thelowestvalueofcriticalloadevolvesfromsomecritical combination of integers mandn, i.e. the number of half-waves in the xandy directions, and the plate dimensions. Clearly n=1 gives a minimum value so that no matter what the values of m,aandbthe plate buckles into a half sine wave in the y direction.Thus we may write Eq.

For le/r>80 this type of column is susceptible to primary instability. In the intermediate rangeofle/rbetween20and80,bucklingoccursbyacombinationofbothprimaryand secondary modes.

In local instability the ﬂanges and webs buckle like plates with a resulting change in the cross-section of the column.The wavelength of the buckle is of the order of thewidthsoftheplateelementsandthecorrespondingcriticalstressisgenerallyindepend-ent of the length of the column when the length is equal to or greater than three timesthe width of the largest plate element in the column cross-section. Bucklingoccurswhentheweakestplateelement,usuallyaﬂange,reachesitscritical stress, although in some cases all the elements reach their critical stresses simultane-ously.When this occurs the rotational restraint provided by adjacent elements to eachother disappears and the elements behave as though they are simply supported alongtheir common edges. These cases are the simplest to analyse and are found where thecross-sectionofthecolumnisanequal-leggedangle,T-,cruciformorasquaretubeofconstantthickness.Valuesoflocalcriticalstressforcolumnspossessingthesetypesofsection may be found using Eq.

(9.7) that plates having large values of b/tbuckle at low values of criticalstress.Aneffectivemethodofreducingthisparameteristointroducestiffeners along the length of the plate thereby dividing a wide sheet into a number of smallerand more stable plates. Alternatively, the sheet may be divided into a series of wideshort columns by stiffeners attached across its width. In the former type of structurethelongitudinalstiffenerscarrypartofthecompressiveload,whileinthelatteralltheload is supported by the plate. Frequently, both methods of stiffening are combined toform a grid-stiffened structure. Stiffeners in earlier types of stiffened panel possessed a relatively high degree of strength compared with the thin skin resulting in the skin buckling at a much lowerstress level than the stiffeners. Such panels may be analysed by assuming that thestiffeners provide simply supported edge conditions to a series of ﬂat plates. A more efﬁcient structure is obtained by adjusting the stiffener sections so that bucklingoccursinbothstiffenersandskinataboutthesamestress.Thisisachievedbyaconstructioninvolvingcloselyspacedstiffenersofcomparablethicknesstotheskin.Since their critical stresses are nearly the same there is an appreciable interaction atbucklingbetweenskinandstiffenerssothatthecompletepanelmustbeconsideredasaunit.However,cautionmustbeexercisedsinceitispossibleforthetwosimultaneouscriticalloadstointeractandreducetheactualcriticalloadofthestructure 2(seeExample 8.4). Various modes of buckling are possible, including primary buckling where thewavelength is of the order of the panel length and local buckling with wavelengths oftheorderofthewidthoftheplateelementsoftheskinorstiffeners.AdiscussionofthevariousbucklingmodesofpanelshavingZ-sectionstiffenershasbeengivenbyArgyrisand Dunne. 3 The prediction of critical stresses for panels with a large number of longitudinal stiffeners is difﬁcult and relies heavily on approximate (energy) and semi-empiricalmethods. Bleich 4and Timoshenko (see Ref. 1, Chapter 8) give energy solutions for plates with one and two longitudinal stiffeners and also consider plates having a largenumber of stiffeners. Gerard and Becker 5have summarized much of the work on stiffened plates and a large amount of theoretical and empirical data is presented by Argyris and Dunne in the Handbook ofAeronautics.3 For detailed work on stiffened panels, reference should be made to as much as possibleoftheabovework.Theliteratureis,however,extensivesothatherewepresentarelativelysimpleapproachsuggestedbyGerard 1.Figure9.5representsapanelofwidth wstiffenedbylongitudinalmemberswhichmaybeﬂats(asshown),Z-,I-,channelor Fig. 9.5 Stiffened panel.Ch09-H6739.tex 25/1/2007 13: 56 302 Thin plates ‘top hat’sections. It is possible for the panel to behave as an Euler column, its cross- section being that shown in Fig. 9.5. If the equivalent length of the panel acting as acolumn is l ethen the Euler critical stress is σCR,E=π2E (le/r)2 as in Eq. (8.8). In addition to the column buckling mode, individual plate elementscomprising the panel cross-section may buckle as long plates. The buckling stress isthen given by Eq. (9.7), i.e. σ CR=ηkπ2E 12(1−ν2)/parenleftbiggt b/parenrightbigg2 where the values of k,tandbdepend upon the particular portion of the panel being investigated.Forexample,theportionofskinbetweenstiffenersmaybuckleasaplatesimply supported on all four sides.

Values of local buckling stress have been determined by Boughan, Baab and Gallaher for idealized web, Z- and T- stiffened panels. The results are reproduced in Rivello6 together with the assumed geometries. Further types of instability found in stiffened panels occur where the stiffeners are riveted or spot welded to the skin. Such structures may be susceptible to interrivetCh09-H6739.tex 25/1/2007 13: 56 9.6 Failure stress in plates and stiffened panels 303 bucklinginwhichtheskinbucklesbetweenrivetswithawavelengthequaltotherivet pitch,orwrinkling wherethestiffenerformsanelasticlinesupportfortheskin.Inthe lattermodethewavelengthofthebuckleisgreaterthantherivetpitchandseparationof skinandstiffenerdoesnotoccur.Methodsofestimatingtheappropriatecriticalstressesare given in Rivello 6and theHandbook ofAeronautics.3 9.6 Failure stress in plates and stiffened panels The previous discussion on plates and stiffened panels investigated the prediction of buckling stresses. However, as we have seen, plates retain some of their capacity tocarry load even though a portion of the plate has buckled. In fact, the ultimate load isnot reached until the stress in the majority of the plate exceeds the elastic limit. Thetheoreticalcalculationoftheultimatestressisdifﬁcultsincenon-linearityresultsfromboth large deﬂections and the inelastic stress–strain relationship. Gerard 1proposes a semi-empirical solution for ﬂat plates supported on all four edges. After elastic buckling occurs theory and experiment indicate that the averagecompressivestress, ¯σ a,intheplateandtheunloadededgestress, σe,arerelatedbythe following expression ¯σa σCR=α1/parenleftbiggσe σCR/parenrightbiggn (9.8) where σCR=kπ2E 12(1−ν2)/parenleftbiggt b/parenrightbigg2 andα1is some unknown constant. Theoretical work by Stowell7and Mayers and Budiansky8shows that failure occurs when the stress along the unloaded edge is approximately equal to the compressive yield strength, σcy, of the material. Hence substituting σcyforσein Eq. (9.8) and rearranging gives ¯σf σcy=α1/parenleftbiggσCR σcy/parenrightbigg1−n (9.9) where the average compressive stress in the plate has become the average stress atfailure ¯σ f.

The calculation of gfor two types of skin/stiffener combination is illustrated in Fig. 9.7. Equation (9.13) is applicable to either monolithic or built uppanels when, in the latter case, interrivet buckling and wrinkling stresses are greaterthan the local failure stress. The values of failure stress given by Eqs (9.11), (9.12) and (9.13) are asso- ciated with local or secondary instability modes. Consequently, they apply whenl e/r≤20. In the intermediate range between the local and primary modes, failure occurs through a combination of both.At the moment there is no theory that predictssatisfactorily failure in this range and we rely on test data and empirical methods. The NACA (now NASA) have produced direct reading charts for the failure of ‘top hat’, Z- and Y-section stiffened panels; a bibliography of the results is given byGerard. 10 It must be remembered that research into methods of predicting the instabil- ity and post-buckling strength of the thin-walled types of structure associated withaircraft construction is a continuous process. Modern developments include theuse of the computer-based ﬁnite element technique (see Chapter 6) and the studyof the sensitivity of thin-walled structures to imperfections produced during fab-rication; much useful information and an extensive bibliography is contained inMurray. 2 Fig. 9.7 Determination of gfor two types of stiffener/skin combination.Ch09-H6739.tex 25/1/2007 13: 56 306 Thin plates Fig. 9.8 Diagonal tension ﬁeld beam. 9.7 Tension ﬁeld beams Thesparsofaircraftwingsusuallycompriseanupperandalowerﬂangeconnectedby thin stiffened webs.

The effect of this assumption is to produce a uniform shear stress distribution through the depth of the web (see Section 20.3) at any section. Therefore, at a section of thebeam where the shear force is S, the shear stress τis given by τ=S td(9.14) Consider now an elementABCD of the web in a panel of the beam, as shown in Fig.9.8(a).Theelementissubjectedtotensilestresses, σ t,producedbythediagonaltension on the planesAB and CD; the angle of the diagonal tension is α.

(8.7) the buckling load of a stiffener is then PCR=π2×70000 ×2000 2532=22.0kN Clearly the stiffener will not buckle. In Eqs (9.28) and (9.29) it is implicitly assumed that a stiffener is fully effective in resisting axial load. This will be the case if the centroid of area of the stiffener lies in the plane of the beam web. Such a situation arises when the stiffener consists of twomembers symmetrically arranged on opposite sides of the web. In the case where theweb is stiffened by a single member attached to one side, the compressive load Pis offset from the stiffener axis thereby producing bending in addition to axial load.

It is possible, if the beam ﬂanges are relatively light, for failuredue to yielding to occur in the beam ﬂanges after the web has buckled so that plastichinges form and a failure mechanism of the type shown in Fig. 9.15 exists.

SupposethatthepanelAXBZinFig.9.15hascollapsedduetoashearload Sanda bending moment M; plastic hinges have formed atW, X,Y and Z. In the initial stages of loading the web remains perfectly ﬂat until it reaches its critical stresses i.e., τ crin shear and σcrbin bending.

Once the critical stress is reached the web starts to buckle and cannot carry any increase in compressive stress so that, aswe have seen in Section 9.7.1, any additional load is carried by tension ﬁeld action.It is assumed that the shear and bending stresses remain at their critical values τ m andσmband that there are additional stresses σtwhich are inclined at an angle θto the horizontal and which carry any increases in the applied load. At collapse, i.e. atultimateloadconditions,theadditionalstress σ treachesitsmaximumvalue σt(max)and the panel is in the collapsed state shown in Fig. 9.15.Ch09-H6739.tex 25/1/2007 13: 56 316 Thin plates Consider now the small rectangular element on the edge AW of the panel before collapse. The stresses acting on the element are shown in Fig. 9.16(a). The stresses on planes parallel to and perpendicular to the direction of the buckle may be foundby considering the equilibrium of triangular elements within this rectangular element.Initially we shall consider the triangular element CDE which is subjected to the stresssystem shown in Fig. 9.16(b) and is in equilibrium under the action of the forcescorrespondingtothesestresses.NotethattheedgeCEoftheelementisparalleltothedirection of the buckle in the web.

The frequency of the oscillation is ω/2π cyclespersecondanditsamplitude x0.Further,theperiodictimeofthemotion,thatis the time taken by one complete oscillation, is 2 π/ω. Both the frequency and periodic time are seen to depend upon the basic physical characteristics of the system, namely the spring stiffness and the magnitude of the mass. Therefore, although the amplitudeof the oscillation may be changed by altering the size of the initial disturbance, itsfrequencyisﬁxed.Thisfrequencyisthenormalornaturalfrequencyofthesystemandthe vertical simple harmonic motion of the mass is its normal mode of vibration. Consider now the system of nmasses connected by ( n−1) springs, as shown in Fig. 10.2.

Associated with each solution are two arbitrary con-stants which determine the phase and amplitude of each mode of vibration. We canthereforerelatethevibrationofasystemtoagivensetofinitialconditionsbyassigningappropriate values to these constants. A useful property of the normal modes of a system is their orthogonality, which is demonstrated by the provable fact that the product of the inertia forces in one modeand the displacements in another results in zero work done. In other words displace-ments in one mode cannot be produced by inertia forces in another. It follows that thenormalmodesareindependentofoneanothersothattheresponseofeachmodetoanexternallyappliedforcemaybefoundwithoutreferencetotheothermodes.Thereforebyconsideringtheresponseofeachmodeinturnandaddingtheresultingmotionswecan ﬁnd the response of the complete system to the applied loading. Another usefulcharacteristic of normal modes is their ‘stationary property’. It can be shown that ifan elastic system is forced to vibrate in a mode that is slightly different from a truenormalmodethefrequencyisonlyveryslightlydifferenttothecorrespondingnaturalfrequency of the system. Reasonably accurate estimates of natural frequencies maytherefore be made from ‘guessed’modes of displacement. We shall proceed to illustrate the general method of solution by determining nor- mal modes and frequencies of some simple beam/mass systems.

As a preliminary to the analysis of the basic aircraft structural forms presented in subsequent chapters we shall discuss the materials used in aircraft construction. Several factors inﬂuence the selection of the structural material for an aircraft, but amongst these strength allied to lightness is probably the most important. Otherproperties having varying, though sometimes critical signiﬁcance are stiffness, tough-ness, resistance to corrosion, fatigue and the effects of environmental heating, ease offabrication, availability and consistency of supply and, not least important, cost. The main groups of materials used in aircraft construction have been wood, steel, aluminiumalloyswith,morerecently,titaniumalloys,andﬁbre-reinforcedcomposites.Intheﬁeldofenginedesign,titaniumalloysareusedintheearlystagesofacompres-sor while nickel-based alloys or steels are used for the hotter later stages.

However, when alloyed with other metals its properties areimprovedsigniﬁcantly.Threegroupsofaluminiumalloyhavebeenusedintheaircraftindustry for many years and still play a major role in aircraft construction. In theﬁrst of these aluminium is alloyed with copper, magnesium, manganese, silicon andiron,andhasatypicalcompositionof4%copper,0.5%magnesium,0.5%manganese,0.3%siliconand0.2%ironwiththeremainderbeingaluminium.Inthewrought,heat-treated, naturally aged condition this alloy possesses a 0.1% proof stress not less than230N/mm 2, a tensile strength not less than 390N/mm2and an elongation at fracture of 15%. Artiﬁcial ageing at a raised temperature of, for example, 170◦C increases the proof stress to not less than 370N/mm2and the tensile strength to not less than 460N/mm2with an elongation of 8%.Ch11-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 22 354 Materials Thesecondgroupofalloyscontain,inadditiontotheabove,1–2%ofnickel,ahigher content of magnesium and possible variations in the amounts of copper, silicon and iron. The most important property of these alloys is their retention of strength at hightemperatures which makes them particularly suitable for aero engine manufacture. AdevelopmentofthesealloysbyRolls-RoyceandHighDutyAlloysLtdreplacedsomeof the nickel by iron and reduced the copper content; these RR alloys, as they werecalled, were used for forgings and extrusions in aero engines and airframes. Thethirdgroupofalloysdependsupontheinclusionofzincandmagnesiumfortheir highstrengthandhaveatypicalcompositionof2.5%copper,5%zinc,3%magnesiumandupto1%nickelwithmechanicalpropertiesof0.1%proofstress510N/mm 2,tensile strength 585N/mm2and an elongation of 8%. In a modern development of this alloy nickelhasbeeneliminatedandprovisionmadefortheadditionofchromiumandfurtheramounts of manganese. Alloys from each of the above groups have been used extensively for airframes, skins and other stressed components, the choice of alloy being inﬂuenced by factorssuch as strength (proof and ultimate stress), ductility, ease of manufacture (e.g. inextrusionandforging),resistancetocorrosionandamenabilitytoprotectivetreatment,fatigue strength, freedom from liability to sudden cracking due to internal stressesand resistance to fast crack propagation under load. Clearly, different types of aircrafthave differing requirements.A military aircraft, for instance, having a relatively shortlife measured in hundreds of hours, does not call for the same degree of fatigue andcorrosion resistance as a civil aircraft with a required life of 30000hours or more. Unfortunately, as one particular property of aluminium alloys is improved, other desirable properties are sacriﬁced. For example, the extremely high static strength ofthealuminium–zinc–magnesiumalloyswasaccompaniedformanyyearsbyasuddenliability to crack in an unloaded condition due to the retention of internal stressesin bars, forgings and sheet after heat treatment. Although variations in composi-tion have eliminated this problem to a considerable extent other deﬁciencies showedthemselves. Early post-war passenger aircraft experienced large numbers of stress-corrosion failures of forgings and extrusions. The problem became so serious that in1953 it was decided to replace as many aluminium–zinc–manganese components aspossible with the aluminium–4 per cent copper Alloy L65 and to prohibit the use offorgings in zinc-bearing alloy in all future designs. However, improvements in thestress-corrosion resistance of the aluminium–zinc–magnesium alloys have resulted inrecentyearsfromBritish,AmericanandGermanresearch.BothBritishandAmericanopinionsagreeonthebeneﬁtsofincludingabout1percentcopperbutdisagreeontheinclusion of chromium and manganese, while in Germany the addition of silver hasbeen found extremely beneﬁcial. Improved control of casting techniques has broughtfurtherimprovementsinresistancetostresscorrosion.Thedevelopmentofaluminium–zinc–magnesium–copper alloys has largely met the requirement for aluminium alloyspossessinghighstrength,goodfatiguecrackgrowthresistanceandadequatetoughness.Furtherdevelopmentwillconcentrateontheproductionofmaterialspossessinghigherspeciﬁcproperties,bringingbeneﬁtsinrelationtoweightsavingratherthanincreasingstrength and stiffness. The ﬁrst group of alloys possess a lower static strength than the above zinc-bearing alloys, but are preferred for portions of the structure where fatigue considerations areof primary importance such as the undersurfaces of wings where tensile fatigue loadsCh11-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 22 11.2 Steel 355 predominate. Experience has shown that the naturally aged version of these alloys has important advantages over the fully heat-treated forms in fatigue endurance andresistance to crack propagation. Furthermore, the inclusion of a higher percentageof magnesium was found, in America, to produce, in the naturally aged condition,mechanicalpropertiesbetweenthoseofthenormalnaturallyagedandartiﬁciallyagedalloy.Thisalloy,designated2024(aluminium–copperalloysformthe2000series)hasthe nominal composition: 4.5 per cent copper, 1.5 per cent magnesium, 0.6 per centmanganese,withtheremainderaluminium,andappearstobeasatisfactorycompromisebetween the various important, but sometimes conﬂicting, mechanical properties. Interest in aluminium–magnesium–silicon alloys has recently increased, although theyhavebeeningeneraluseintheaerospaceindustryfordecades.Thereasonsforthisrenewedinterestarethattheyarepotentiallycheaperthanaluminium–copperalloysand,beingweldable,arecapableofreducingmanufacturingcosts.Inaddition,variants,suchas the ISO 6013 alloy, have improved property levels and, generally, possess a similarhigh fracture toughness and resistance to crack propagation as the 2000 series alloys. Frequently, a particular form of an alloy is developed for a particular aircraft.

In the USA the aluminium–lithium–copper alloy, 2095, has been used in the fuselage frames of the F16 as areplacement for 2124, resulting in a ﬁvefold increase in fatigue life and a reduction inweight.Aluminium–lithiumalloyscanbesuccessfullywelded,possessahighfracturetoughness and exhibit a high resistance to crack propagation. 11.2 Steel The use of steel for the manufacture of thin-walled, box-section spars in the 1930s has been superseded by the aluminium alloys described in Section 11.1. Clearly, itsCh11-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 22 356 Materials high speciﬁc gravity prevents its widespread use in aircraft construction, but it has retained some value as a material for castings for small components demanding hightensile strengths, high stiffness and high resistance to wear. Such components includeundercarriage pivot brackets, wing-root attachments, fasteners and tracks. Although the attainment of high and ultra-high tensile strengths presents no difﬁ- culty with steel, it is found that other properties are sacriﬁced and that it is difﬁcult tomanufactureintoﬁnishedcomponents.Toovercomesomeofthesedifﬁcultiestypesofsteel known as maraging steels were developed in 1961, from which carbon is either eliminated entirely or present only in very small amounts. Carbon, while producingthenecessaryhardeningofconventionalhightensilesteels,causesbrittlenessanddis-tortion; the latter is not easily rectiﬁable as machining is difﬁcult and cold formingimpracticable. Welded fabrication is also almost impossible or very expensive. Thehardening of maraging steels is achieved by the addition of other elements such asnickel, cobalt and molybdenum. A typical maraging steel would have these elementspresent in the proportions: nickel 17–19 per cent, cobalt 8–9 per cent, molybdenum3–3.5 per cent, with titanium 0.15–0.25 per cent. The carbon content would be amaximum of 0.03 per cent, with traces of manganese, silicon, sulphur, phosphorus,aluminium, boron, calcium and zirconium. Its 0.2 per cent proof stress would benominally 1400N/mm 2and its modulus of elasticity 180000N/mm2. Themainadvantagesofmaragingsteelsoverconventionallowalloysteelsare:higher fracture toughness and notched strength, simpler heat treatment, much lower volumechangeanddistortionduringhardening,verymuchsimplertoweld,easiertomachineand better resistance to stress corrosion/hydrogen embrittlement. On the other hand,the material cost of maraging steels is three or more times greater than the cost ofconventional steels, although this may be more than offset by the increased cost offabricating a complex component from the latter steel. Maraging steels have been used in: aircraft arrester hooks, rocket motor cases, helicopter undercarriages, gears, ejector seats and various structural forgings. In addition to the above, steel in its stainless form has found applications primar- ily in the construction of super- and hypersonic experimental and research aircraft,where temperature effects are considerable. Stainless steel formed the primary struc-turalmaterialintheBristol188,builttoinvestigatekineticheatingeffects,andalsointheAmerican rocket aircraft, the X-15, capable of speeds of the order of Mach 5–6. 11.3 Titanium The use of titanium alloys increased signiﬁcantly in the 1980s, particularly in the constructionofcombataircraftasopposedtotransportaircraft.Thisincreasecontinuedinthe1990stothestagewhere,forcombataircraft,thepercentageoftitaniumalloyasafractionofstructuralweightisofthesameorderasthatofaluminiumalloy.Titaniumalloys possess high speciﬁc properties, have a good fatigue strength/tensile strengthratiowithadistinctfatiguelimit,andsomeretainconsiderablestrengthattemperaturesupto400–500 ◦C.Generally,thereisalsoagoodresistancetocorrosionandcorrosion fatiguealthoughpropertiesareadverselyaffectedbyexposuretotemperatureandstressin a salt environment. The latter poses particular problems in the engines of carrier-operated aircraft. Further disadvantages are a relatively high density so that weightCh11-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 22 11.6 Composite materials 357 penalties are imposed if the alloy is extensively used, coupled with high primary and high fabrication costs, approximately seven times those of aluminium and steel. In spite of this, titanium alloys were used in the airframe and engines of Con- corde,whiletheTornadowingcarry-throughboxisfabricatedfromaweldablemediumstrength titanium alloy. Titanium alloys are also used extensively in the F15 and F22 American ﬁghter aircraft and are incorporated in the tail assembly of the Boeing 777 civil airliner. Other uses include forged components such as ﬂap and slat tracks andundercarriage parts. Newfabricationprocesses(e.g.superplasticformingcombinedwithdiffusionbond- ing) enable large and complex components to be produced, resulting in a reduction inproduction man-hours and weight. Typical savings are 30 per cent in man-hours, 30percentinweightand50percentincostcomparedwithconventionalrivetedtitaniumstructures.Itispredictedthatthenumberoftitaniumcomponentsfabricatedinthiswayforaircraftwillincreasesigniﬁcantlyandincludeitemssuchasaccessdoors,sheetforareas of hot gas impingement, etc. 11.4 Plastics Plainplasticmaterialshavespeciﬁcgravitiesofapproximatelyunityandarethereforeconsiderably heavier than wood although of comparable strength.

They are also particularly useful as electrical insu-latorsandasenergyabsorbingshieldsfordelicateinstrumentationandevenstructureswhere severe vibration, such as in a rocket or space shuttle launch, occurs. 11.5 Glass The majority of modern aircraft have cabins pressurized for ﬂight at high altitudes. Windscreens and windows are therefore subjected to loads normal to their midplanes. Glass is frequently the material employed for this purpose in the form of plain orlaminated plate or heat-strengthened plate. The types of plate glass used in aircrafthave a modulus of elasticity between 70000 and 75000N/mm 2with a modulus of rupture in bending of 45N/mm2. Heat-strengthened plate has a modulus of rupture of about four and a half times this ﬁgure. 11.6 Composite materials Composite materials consist of strong ﬁbres such as glass or carbon set in a matrixof plastic or epoxy resin, which is mechanically and chemically protective.The ﬁbresmaybecontinuousordiscontinuousbutpossessastrengthverymuchgreaterthanthatof the same bulk materials. For example, carbon ﬁbres have a tensile strength of theorder of 2400N/mm 2and a modulus of elasticity of 400000N/mm2.Ch11-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 22 358 Materials A sheet of ﬁbre-reinforced material is anisotropic, i.e. its properties depend on the direction of the ﬁbres. Generally, therefore, in structural form two or more sheets are sandwiched together to form a lay-upso that the ﬁbre directions match those of the major loads. Intheearlystagesofthedevelopmentofcompositematerialsglassﬁbreswereused in a matrix of epoxy resin. This glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) was used for radomesand helicopter blades but found limited use in components of ﬁxed wing aircraft dueto its low stiffness. In the 1960s, new ﬁbrous reinforcements were introduced; Kevlar,forexample,isanaramidmaterialwiththesamestrengthasglassbutisstiffer.Kevlarcomposites are tough but poor in compression and difﬁcult to machine, so they wereused in secondary structures. Another composite, using boron ﬁbre and developed intheUSA,wastheﬁrsttopossesssufﬁcientstrengthandstiffnessforprimarystructures. These composites have now been replaced by carbon-ﬁbre-reinforced plastics (CFRP),whichhavesimilarpropertiestoboroncompositesbutareverymuchcheaper. Typically, CFRP has a modulus of the order of three times that of GRP, one and a half times that of a Kevlar composite and twice that of aluminium alloy. Its strengthis three times that of aluminium alloy, approximately the same as that of GRP, andslightly less than that of Kevlar composites. CFRP does, however, suffer from somedisadvantages.Itisabrittlematerialandthereforedoesnotyieldplasticallyinregionsof high stress concentration. Its strength is reduced by impact damage which may notbe visible and the epoxy resin matrices can absorb moisture over a long period whichreduces its matrix-dependent properties, such as its compressive strength; this effectincreases with increase of temperature. Further, the properties of CFRP are subject tomore random variation than those of metals. All these factors must be allowed for indesign.Ontheotherhand,thestiffnessofCFRPismuchlessaffectedthanitsstrengthby the above and it is less prone to fatigue damage than metals. It is estimated thatreplacing40%ofanaluminiumalloystructurebyCFRPwouldresultina12%savingin total structural weight. CFRP is included in the wing, tailplane and forward fuselage of the latest Harrier development,isusedintheTornadotaileronandhasbeenusedtoconstructacompleteJaguar wing and engine bay door for testing purposes. The use of CFRP in the fabri-cation of helicopter blades has led to signiﬁcant increases in their service life, wherefatigueresistanceratherthanstiffnessisofprimaryimportance.Figure11.1showsthestructural complexity of a Sea King helicopter rotor blade which incorporates CFRP,GRP,stainlesssteel,ahoneycombcoreandfoamﬁlling.Anadditionaladvantageoftheuseofcompositesforhelicopterrotorbladesisthatthemouldingtechniquesemployedallow variations of cross-section along the span, resulting in substantial aerodynamicbeneﬁts. This approach is being employed in the fabrication of the main rotor bladesof the GKNWestland Helicopters EH101. Acomposite(ﬁbreglassandaluminium)isusedinthetailassemblyoftheBoeing777 while the leading edge of theAirbusA310–300/A320 ﬁn assembly is of conventionalreinforced glass ﬁbre construction, reinforced at the nose to withstand bird strikes. A complete composite airframe was produced for the Beechcraft Starship turboprop executive aircraft which, however, was not a commercial success due to its canardconﬁguration causing drag and weight penalties.

Metal matrix composites such asgraphite–aluminium and boron–aluminium are lightweight and retain their strength athigher temperatures than aluminium alloys, but are expensive to produce. Generally, the use of composites in aircraft construction appears to have reached a plateau, particularly in civil subsonic aircraft where the fraction of the structure com-prising composites is approximately 15%. This is due largely to the greater cost ofmanufacturing composites compared with aluminium alloy structures since compos-ites require hand crafting of the materials and manual construction processes. Theseincreasedcostsareparticularlyimportantincivilaircraftconstructionandarebecomingincreasingly important in military aircraft. 11.7 Properties of materials In Sections 11.1–11.6 we discussed the various materials used in aircraft constructionandlistedsomeoftheirproperties.Weshallnowexamineinmoredetailtheirbehaviourunder load and also deﬁne different types of material. Ductility A material is said to be ductileif it is capable of withstanding large strains under load beforefractureoccurs.Theselargestrainsareaccompaniedbyavisiblechangeincross-sectionaldimensionsandthereforegivewarningofimpendingfailure.Materialsinthiscategory include mild steel, aluminium and some of its alloys, copper and polymers.Ch11-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 22 360 Materials Brittleness A brittle material exhibits little deformation before fracture, the strain normally being below 5%. Brittle materials therefore may fail suddenly without visible warning. Includedinthisgroupareconcrete,castiron,highstrengthsteel,timberandceramics. Elastic materials Amaterialissaidtobe elasticifdeformationsdisappearcompletelyonremovalofthe load. All known engineering materials are, in addition, linearly elastic within certain limits of stress so that strain, within these limits, is directly proportional to stress. Plasticity Amaterialisperfectly plasticifnostraindisappearsaftertheremovalofload.Ductile materials are elastoplastic and behave in an elastic manner until the elastic limit is reached after which they behave plastically. When the stress is relieved the elasticcomponent of the strain is recovered but the plastic strain remains as a permanent set. Isotropic materials In many materials the elastic properties are the same in all directions at each point inthe material although they may vary from point to point, such a material is known asisotropic. An isotropic material having the same properties at all points is known as homogeneous (e.g. mild steel). Anisotropic materials Materials having varying elastic properties in different directions are known asanisotropic. Orthotropic materials Althoughastructuralmaterialmaypossessdifferentelasticpropertiesindifferentdirec- tions,thisvariationmaybelimited,asinthecaseoftimberwhichhasjusttwovaluesof Young’smodulus,oneinthedirectionofthegrainandoneperpendiculartothegrain.A materialwhoseelasticpropertiesarelimitedtothreedifferentvaluesinthreemutuallyperpendicular directions is known as orthotropic. 11.7.1 Testing of engineering materials Thepropertiesofengineeringmaterialsaredeterminedmainlybythemechanicaltesting of specimens machined to prescribed sizes and shapes. The testing may be static ordynamic in nature depending on the particular property being investigated. Possiblythe most common mechanical static tests are tensile and compressive tests which arecarriedoutonawiderangeofmaterials.Ferrousandnon-ferrousmetalsaresubjectedCh11-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 22 11.7 Properties of materials 361 Gauge pointsDiameter, D Radius, RFractionally reduceddiameter Gauge length (GL) Length, L Fig. 11.2 Standard cylindrical test piece. to both forms of test, while compression tests are usually carried out on many non- metallic materials. Other static tests include bending, shear and hardness tests, whilethe toughness of a material, in other words its ability to withstand shock loads, isdetermined by impact tests. Tensile tests Tensile tests are normally carried out on metallic materials and, in addition, timber.Test pieces are machined from a batch of material, their dimensions being speciﬁed by Codes of Practice. They are commonly circular in cross-section, although ﬂat testpieces having rectangular cross-sections are used when the batch of material is in theform of a plate.A typical test piece would have the dimensions speciﬁed in Fig. 11.2.Usually the diameter of a central portion of the test piece is fractionally less than thatof the remainder to ensure that the test piece fractures between the gauge points. Before the test begins, the mean diameter of the test piece is obtained by taking measurements at several sections using a micrometer screw gauge. Gauge points arepunched at the required gauge length, the test piece is placed in the testing machineand a suitable strain measuring device, usually an extensometer, is attached to thetest piece at the gauge points so that the extension is measured over the given gaugelength. Increments of load are applied and the corresponding extensions recorded. This procedure continues until yield occurs, when the extensometer is removed as a precaution against the damage which would be caused if the test piece fracturedunexpectedly. Subsequent extensions are measured by dividers placed in the gaugepointsuntil,ultimately,thetestpiecefractures.Theﬁnalgaugelengthandthediameterof the test piece in the region of the fracture are measured so that the percentageelongation and percentage reduction in area may be calculated.These two parametersgive a measure of the ductility of the material. A stress–strain curve is drawn (see Figs 11.9 and 11.13), the stress normally being calculatedonthebasisoftheoriginalcross-sectionalareaofthetestpiece,i.e.a nominal stressasopposedtoan actualstress (whichisbasedontheactualareaofcross-section). For ductile materials there is a marked difference in the latter stages of the test as a considerablereductionincross-sectionalareaoccursbetweenyieldandfracture.Fromthestress–straincurvetheultimatestress,theyieldstressandYoung’smodulus, E,are obtained.Ch11-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 22 362 Materials There are a number of variations on the basic tensile test described above. Some of these depend upon the amount of additional information required and some upon the choiceofequipment.Thereisawiderangeofstrainmeasuringdevicestochoosefrom,extendingfromdifferentmakesofmechanicalextensometer,e.g.Huggenberger,Lind-ley, Cambridge, to the electrical resistance strain gauge.

Testing machines are usually driven hydraulically. More sophisticated versions employloadcellstorecordloadandautomaticallyplotloadagainstextensionorstressagainst strain on a pen recorder as the test proceeds, an advantage when investigatingthe distinctive behaviour of mild steel at yield. Compression tests A compression test is similar in operation to a tensile test, with the obvious differ- ence that the load transmitted to the test piece is compressive rather than tensile. Thisis achieved by placing the test piece between the platens of the testing machine andreversing the direction of loading. Test pieces are normally cylindrical and are lim-ited in length to eliminate the possibility of failure being caused by instability.Againcontractions are measured over a given gauge length by a suitable strain measuringdevice. Variations in test pieces occur when only the ultimate strength of the material in compression is required. For this purpose concrete test pieces may take the form ofcubes having edges approximately 10cm long, while mild steel test pieces are stillcylindrical in section but are of the order of 1cm long. Bending tests Many structural members are subjected primarily to bending moments. Bending testsare therefore carried out on simple beams constructed from the different materials todetermine their behaviour under this type of load. Two forms of loading are employed the choice depending upon the type speciﬁed inCodesofPracticefortheparticularmaterial.Intheﬁrstasimplysupportedbeamissubjected to a ‘two-point’loading system as shown in Fig. 11.3(a). Two concentratedloads are applied symmetrically to the beam, producing zero shear force and constantbending moment in the central span of the beam (Fig. 11.3(b) and (c)). The conditionof pure bending is therefore achieved in the central span.

Thus plastic properties, for example the ultimate strength in bending, cannot be determined for such materials. In the case of brittle materials,including cast iron, timber and various plastics, failure does occur, so that plasticproperties can be evaluated. For such materials the ultimate strength in bending isdeﬁned by the modulus of rupture.

In the usual form of test a solid circular-section test piece is placed in a torsionmachine and twisted by controlled increments of torque. The corresponding anglesof twist are recorded and torque–twist diagrams plotted from which the shear prop-erties of the material are obtained. The method is similar to that used to determinethe tensile properties of a material from a tensile test and uses relationships derived inChapter 3.

Hardness tests are also used to investigate the effects of heat treat-ment, hardening and tempering and of cold forming.Two types of hardness test are incommon use: indentation tests andscratch and abrasion tests.

For steel and hard materials F=3000kg andD=10mm while for soft materials F=500kg and D=10mm; in addition the load is usually applied for 15s.

For example,carbonﬁbreshaveatensilestrengthoftheorder2400N/mm 2andamodulusofelasticity of 400000N/mm2. Fibre composites are highly durable, require no maintenance and can be used in hostile chemical and atmospheric environments; vinyls and epoxy resins provide thebest resistance. Allthestress–straincurvesdescribedintheprecedingdiscussionarethoseproduced intensileorcompressiontestsinwhichthestrainisappliedatanegligiblerate.Arapidstrain application would result in signiﬁcant changes in the apparent properties of thematerials giving possible variations in yield stress of up to 100%. 11.7.3 Strain hardening Thestress–straincurveforamaterialisinﬂuencedbythe strainhistory,ortheloading and unloading of the material, within the plastic range. For example, in Fig. 11.17 atestpieceisinitiallystressedintensionbeyondtheyieldstressat,‘a’,toavalueat‘b’. The material is then unloaded to ‘c’and reloaded to ‘f’producing an increase in yield stressfromthevalueat‘a’tothevalueat‘d’.Subsequentunloadingto‘g’andloadingto‘j’increasestheyieldstressstillfurthertothevalueat‘h’.Thisincreaseinstrengthresulting from the loading and unloading is known as strain hardening. It can be seen from Fig. 11.17 that the stress–strain curve during the unloading and loading cyclesform loops (the shaded areas in Fig. 11.17). These indicate that strain energy is lostduring the cycle, the energy being dissipated in the form of heat produced by internalfriction.Thisenergylossisknownas mechanicalhysteresis andtheloopsas hysteresis loops.Althoughtheultimatestressisincreasedbystrainhardeningitisnotinﬂuenced tothesameextentasyieldstress.Theincreaseinstrengthproducedbystrainhardeningis accompanied by decreases in toughness and ductility.Ch11-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 22 372 Materials ab cgdf j h 0 Strain, εStress, s Fig. 11.17 Strain hardening of a material. 11.7.4 Creep and relaxation We have seen in Chapter 1 that a given load produces a calculable value of stress in a structuralmemberandhenceacorrespondingvalueofstrainoncethefullvalueofthe load is transferred to the member. However, after this initial or ‘instantaneous’stressand its corresponding value of strain have been attained, a great number of structuralmaterialscontinuetodeformslowlyandprogressivelyunderloadoveraperiodoftime. This behaviour is known as creep.A typical creep curve is shown in Fig. 11.18. Somematerials,suchasplasticsandrubber,exhibitcreepatroomtemperaturesbut moststructuralmaterialsrequirehightemperaturesorlong-durationloadingatmoderatetemperatures.Insome‘soft’metals,suchaszincandlead,creepoccursoverarelativelyshort period of time, whereas materials such as concrete may be subject to creep overa period of years.

Whereas creep involves an increase in strain under constant stress, relaxation is the decrease in stress experienced over a period of time by a material subjected to a constant strain. 11.7.5 Fatigue Structuralmembersarefrequentlysubjectedtorepetitiveloadingoveralongperiodoftime. For example, the members of a bridge structure suffer variations in loading pos-siblythousandsoftimesadayastrafﬁcmovesoverthebridge.Inthesecircumstancesa structural member may fracture at a level of stress substantially below the ultimatestress for non-repetitive static loads; this phenomenon is known as fatigue. Fatiguecracksaremostfrequentlyinitiatedatsectionsinastructuralmemberwhere changes in geometry, e.g. holes, notches or sudden changes in section, cause stress concentrations. Designersseektoeliminatesuchareasbyensuringthatrapidchanges in section are as smooth as possible. At re-entrant corners for example, ﬁllets areprovided as shown in Fig. 11.19.

Frequently in structural members an alternating stress, σ alt, is superimposed on a static or mean stress, σmean, as illustrated in Fig. 11.20. The value of σaltis the most important factor in determining the number of cycles of load that produce failure. The stress σalt, that can be withstood for a speciﬁed number of cycles is called the fatigue strength of the material. Some materials, such as mild steel, possess a stress level that can be withstood for an indeﬁnite number of cycles. This stress is knownas theendurance limit of the material; no such limit has been found for aluminium and its alloys. Fatigue data are frequently presented in the form of an S–ncurve or stress–endurance curve as shown in Fig. 11.21. In many practical situations the amplitude of the alternating stress varies and is frequently random in nature. The S–ncurve does not, therefore, apply directly and an alternative means of predicting failure is required.

There are variations in particular aircraft, for example, a delta wing aircraft would not necessarily possess a horizontal tail although this is presentin a canard conﬁguration such as that of the Euroﬁghter (Typhoon). Each componenthas one or more speciﬁc functions and must be designed to ensure that it can carryout these functions safely. In this chapter we shall describe the various loads to whichaircraftcomponentsaresubjected,theirfunctionandfabricationandalsothedesignofconnections. 12.1 Loads on structural components Thestructureofanaircraftisrequiredtosupporttwodistinctclassesofload:theﬁrst, termedground loads , includes all loads encountered by the aircraft during movement ortransportationonthegroundsuchastaxiingandlandingloads,towingandhoistingloads; while the second, air loads, comprises lòads imposed on the structure during ﬂight by manoeuvres and gusts.

The two classes of loads may be further divided into surface forces which act upon thesurfaceofthestructure,e.g.aerodynamicandhydrostaticpressure,and bodyforces whichactoverthevolumeofthestructureandareproducedbygravitationalandinertialeffects.Calculationofthedistributionofaerodynamicpressureoverthevarioussurfacesof an aircraft’s structure is presented in numerous texts on aerodynamics and willtherefore not be attempted here. We shall, however, discuss the types of load inducedby these various effects and their action on the different structural components.Ch12-H6739.tex 25/1/2007 14: 14 12.1 Loads on structural components 377 Fig. 12.1 Principal aerodynamic forces on an aircraft during ﬂight. Fig. 12.2 (a) Pressure distribution around an aerofoil; (b) transference of lift and drag loads to the AC. Basically,allairloadsaretheresultantsofthepressuredistributionoverthesurfaces of the skin produced by steady ﬂight, manoeuvre or gust conditions. Generally, these resultants cause direct loads, bending, shear and torsion in all parts of the structure inaddition to local, normal pressure loads imposed on the skin. Conventional aircraft usually consist of fuselage, wings and tailplane.The fuselage contains crew and payload, the latter being passengers, cargo, weapons plus fuel,depending on the type of aircraft and its function; the wings provide the lift and thetailplane is the main contributor to directional control. In addition, ailerons, elevatorsand the rudder enable the pilot to manoeuvre the aircraft and maintain its stability inﬂight, while wing ﬂaps provide the necessary increase of lift for take-off and landing.Figure 12.1 shows typical aerodynamic force resultants experienced by an aircraft insteady ﬂight. Theforceonanaerodynamicsurface(wing,verticalorhorizontaltail)resultsfroma differentialpressuredistributioncausedbyincidence,camberoracombinationofboth.Such a pressure distribution, shown in Fig. 12.2(a), has vertical (lift) and horizontal(drag) resultants acting at a centre of pressure (CP). (In practice, lift and drag aremeasuredperpendicularandparalleltotheﬂightpath,respectively.)Clearlythepositionof the CP changes as the pressure distribution varies with speed or wing incidence.Ch12-H6739.tex 25/1/2007 14: 14 378 Structural components of aircraft Fig. 12.3 Typical lift distribution for a wing/fuselage combination. However,thereis,conveniently,apointintheaerofoilsectionaboutwhichthemoment due to the lift and drag forces remains constant.We therefore replace the lift and dragforces acting at the CP by lift and drag forces acting at the aerodynamic centre (AC)plusaconstantmoment M 0asshowninFig.12.2(b).(Actually,athighMachnumbers the position of theAC changes due to compressibility effects.) While the chordwise pressure distribution ﬁxes the position of the resultant aero- dynamic load in the wing cross-section, the spanwise distribution locates its positionin relation, say, to the wing root. A typical distribution for a wing/fuselage combina-tion is shown in Fig. 12.3. Similar distributions occur on horizontal and vertical tailsurfaces. We see therefore that wings, tailplane and the fuselage are each subjected to direct, bending,shearandtorsionalloadsandmustbedesignedtowithstandcriticalcombin-ations of these. Note that manoeuvres and gusts do not introduce different loads butresultonlyinchangesofmagnitudeandpositionofthetypeofexistingloadsshowninFig.12.1.Overandabovethesebasicin-ﬂightloads,fuselagesmaybepressurizedandthereby support hoop stresses, wings may carry weapons and/or extra fuel tanks withresultingadditionalaerodynamicandbodyforcescontributingtotheexistingbending,shear and torsion, while the thrust and weight of engines may affect either fuselage orwings depending on their relative positions.

Clearly the position of the main undercarriage should be such as toproduce minimum loads on the wing structure compatible with the stability of theaircraftduringgroundmanoeuvres.Thismaybeachievedbylocatingtheundercarriagejust forward of the ﬂexural axis of the wing and as close to the wing root as possible.In this case the shock landing load produces a given shear, minimum bending plustorsion,withthelatterbeingreducedasfaraspracticablebyoffsettingthetorquecausedby the vertical load in the undercarriage leg by a torque in an opposite sense due tobraking. Other loads include engine thrust on the wings or fuselage which acts in the plane of symmetry but may, in the case of engine failure, cause severe fuselage bendingmoments, as shown in Fig. 12.4; concentrated shock loads during a catapult launch;and hydrodynamic pressure on the fuselages or ﬂoats of seaplanes.Ch12-H6739.tex 25/1/2007 14: 14 12.2 Function of structural components 379 Fig. 12.4 Fuselage and wing bending caused by an unsymmetrical engine load. In Chapter 13 we shall examine in detail the calculation of ground and air loads for a variety of cases. 12.2 Function of structural components Thebasicfunctionsofanaircraft’sstructurearetotransmitandresisttheappliedloads; to provide an aerodynamic shape and to protect passengers, payload, systems, etc. from the environmental conditions encountered in ﬂight.These requirements, in mostaircraft, result in thin shell structures where the outer surface or skin of the shell isusually supported by longitudinal stiffening members and transverse frames to enableittoresistbending,compressiveandtorsionalloadswithoutbuckling.Suchstructuresare known as semi-monocoque, while thin shells which rely entirely on their skins for their capacity to resist loads are referred to as monocoque. First, we shall consider wing sections which, while performing the same function, candifferwidelyintheirstructuralcomplexity,ascanbeseenbycomparingFigs12.5and 12.6. In Fig. 12.5, the wing of the small, light passenger aircraft, the De Havil-land CanadaTwin Otter, comprises a relatively simple arrangement of two spars, ribs,stringersandskin,whilethewingoftheHarrierinFig.12.6consistsofnumerousspars,ribsandskin.However,nomatterhowcomplextheinternalstructuralarrangementthedifferentcomponentsperformthesamekindoffunction.Theshapeofthecross-sectionisgovernedbyaerodynamicconsiderationsandclearlymustbemaintainedforallcom-binationsofload;thisisoneofthefunctionsoftheribs.Theyalsoactwiththeskininresistingthedistributedaerodynamicpressureloads;theydistributeconcentratedloads(e.g. undercarriage and additional wing store loads) into the structure and redistributestress around discontinuities, such as undercarriage wells, inspection panels and fueltanks,inthewingsurface.Ribsincreasethecolumnbucklingstressofthelongitudinalstiffeners by providing end restraint and establishing their column length; in a similarmannertheyincreasetheplatebucklingstressoftheskinpanels.Thedimensionsofribsaregovernedbytheirspanwisepositioninthewingandbytheloadstheyarerequiredtosupport.Intheouterportionsofthewing,wherethecross-sectionmayberelativelysmallifthewingistaperedandtheloadsarelight,ribsactprimarilyasformersfortheaerofoilshape.Alightstructureissufﬁcientforthispurposewhereasatsectionsclosertothewingroot,wheretheribsarerequiredtoabsorbandtransmitlargeconcentratedCh12-H6739.tex 25/1/2007 14: 14 380 Structural components of aircraft appliedloads,suchasthosefromtheundercarriage,enginethrustandfuselageattach- ment point reactions, a much more rugged construction is necessary. Between thesetwo extremes are ribs which support hinge reactions from ailerons, ﬂaps and othercontrol surfaces, plus the many internal loads from fuel, armament and systemsinstallations.

Although the thin skin is efﬁcient for resisting shear and tensile loads, it buckles under comparatively low compressive loads. Rather than increase the skin thicknessand suffer a consequent weight penalty, stringers are attached to the skin and ribs,thereby dividing the skin into small panels and increasing the buckling and failingstresses. This stabilizing action of the stringers on the skin is, in fact, reciprocated tosomeextentalthoughtheeffectnormaltothesurfaceoftheskinisminimal.Stringersrelychieﬂyonribattachmentsforpreventingcolumnactioninthisdirection.Wehavenoted in the previous paragraph the combined action of stringers and skin in resistingaxial and bending loads. Theroleofsparwebsindevelopingshearstressestoresistshearandtorsionalloads has been mentioned previously; they perform a secondary but signiﬁcant function instabilizing, with the skin, the spar ﬂanges or caps which are therefore capable ofsupporting large compressive loads from axial and bending effects. In turn, spar websexert a stabilizing inﬂuence on the skin in a similar manner to the stringers. Whilethemajorityoftheaboveremarkshavebeendirectedtowardswingstructures, they apply, as can be seen by referring to Figs 12.5 and 12.6, to all the aerodynamicsurfaces, namely wings, horizontal and vertical tails, except in the obvious cases ofundercarriage loading, engine thrust, etc. Fuselages,whileofdifferentshapetotheaerodynamicsurfaces,comprisemembers whichperformsimilarfunctionstotheircounterpartsinthewingsandtailplane.How-ever, there are differences in the generation of the various types of load.Aerodynamicforces on the fuselage skin are relatively low; on the other hand, the fuselage supportslargeconcentratedloadssuchaswingreactions,tailplanereactions,undercarriagereac-tionsanditcarriespayloadsofvaryingsizeandweight,whichmaycauselargeinertiaforces. Furthermore, aircraft designed for high altitude ﬂight must withstand internalpressure.Theshapeofthefuselagecross-sectionisdeterminedbyoperationalrequire-ments.

Althoughthewings(andtailsurfaces)ofﬁxedwingaircraftgenerallyconsistofspars, ribs, skin and stringers, methods of fabrication and assembly differ. The wing of theaircraftofFig.12.5reliesonfabricationtechniquesthathavebeenemployedformanyyears. In this form of construction the spars comprise thin aluminium alloy webs andﬂanges,thelatterbeingextrudedormachinedandareboltedorrivetedtotheweb.Theribs are formed in three parts from sheet metal by large presses and rubber dies andhave ﬂanges round their edges so that they can be riveted to the skin and spar webs;cut-outs around their edges allow the passage of spanwise stringers. Holes are cut inthe ribs at positions of low stress for lightness and to accommodate control runs, fueland electrical systems. Finally, the skin is riveted to the rib ﬂanges and longitudinal stiffeners. Where the curvatureoftheskinislarge,forexampleattheleadingedge,thealuminiumalloysheetsarepassedthrough‘rolls’topre-formthemtothecorrectshape.Afurther,aerodynamic,requirement is that forward chordwise sections of the wing should be as smooth aspossibletodelaytransitionfromlaminartoturbulentﬂow.Thus,countersunkrivetsareused in these positions as opposed to dome-headed rivets nearer the trailing edge.

This integral method of constructioninvolves no new design principles and has the advantages of combining a high gradeof surface ﬁnish, free from irregularities, with a more efﬁcient use of material sinceskin thicknesses are easily tapered to coincide with the spanwise decrease in bendingstresses. An alternative form of construction is the sandwich panel, which comprises a light honeycomborcorrugatedmetalcoresandwichedbetweentwoouterskinsofthestress-bearing sheet (see Fig. 12.10).

Thegeneralprinciplesrelatingtowingconstructionareapplicabletofuselages,with the exception that integral construction is not used in fuselages for obvious reasons.Figures12.5,12.6and12.7showthatthesamebasicmethodofconstructionisemployedin aircraft having widely differing roles. Generally, the fuselage frames that supportlarge concentrated ﬂoor loads or loads from wing or tailplane attachment points areheavierthanlightlyloadedframesandrequirestiffening,withadditionalprovisionfortransmitting the concentrated load into the frame and hence the skin. Withtheframesinpositioninthefuselagejig,stringers,passingthroughcut-outs,are rivetedtotheframeﬂanges.Beforetheskinisrivetedtotheframesandstringers,othersubsidiary frames such as door and window frames are riveted or bolted in position. The areas of the fuselage in the regions of these cut-outs are reinforced by additional stringers, portions of frame and increased skin thickness, to react to the high shearﬂows and direct stresses developed. On completion, the various sub-assemblies are brought together for ﬁnal assembly. Fuselagesectionsareusuallyboltedtogetherthroughﬂangesaroundtheirperipheries,while wings and the tailplane are attached to pick-up points on the relevant fusel-age frames. Wing spars on low wing civil aircraft usually pass completely throughthe fuselage, simplifying wing design and the method of attachment. On smaller,military aircraft, engine installations frequently prevent this so that wing spars areattached directly to and terminate at the fuselage frame. Clearly, at these positionsframe/stringer/skin structures require reinforcement. 12.4 Connections The fabrication of aircraft components generally involves the joining of one part of the component to another. For example, fuselage skins are connected to stringers andframes while wing skins are connected to stringers and wing ribs unless, as in somemilitary aircraft with high wing loadings, the stringers are machined integrally withthe wing skin (see Section 12.3). With the advent of all-metal, i.e. aluminium alloyconstruction, riveted joints became the main form of connection with some weldingalthough aluminium alloys are difﬁcult to weld, and, in the modern era, some gluedjointswhichuseepoxyresin.Inthissectionweshallconcentrateonthestillpredominantmethod of connection, riveting.

The hand-booksincludeoperationalrequirements,minimumsafetyrequirements,recommendedpractices and design data, etc. Inthischapterweshallconcentrateonthestructuralaspectsofairworthinesswhich depend chieﬂy on the strength and stiffness of the aircraft. Stiffness problems may beconvenientlygroupedundertheheading aeroelasticity andarediscussedinSectionB6. Strength problems arise, as we have seen, from ground and air loads, and their mag-nitudesdependontheselectionofmanoeuvringandotherconditionsapplicabletotheoperational requirements of a particular aircraft. 13.1 Factors of safety-ﬂight envelope The control of weight in aircraft design is of extreme importance. Increases in weight require stronger structures to support them, which in turn lead to further increasesin weight and so on. Excesses of structural weight mean lesser amounts of payload,therebyaffectingtheeconomicviabilityoftheaircraft.Theaircraftdesigneristhereforeconstantlyseekingtoparehisaircraft’sweighttotheminimumcompatiblewithsafety.However, to ensure general minimum standards of strength and safety, airworthinessregulations lay down several factors which the primary structure of the aircraft mustsatisfy.Thesearethe limitload,whichisthemaximumloadthattheaircraftisexpected toexperienceinnormaloperation,the proofload,whichistheproductofthelimitload andtheprooffactor (1.0–1.25),andthe ultimateload,whichistheproductofthelimit load and the ultimate factor (usually 1.5). The aircraft’s structure must withstand the proof load without detrimental distortion and should not fail until the ultimate loadhasbeenachieved.Theproofandultimatefactorsmayberegardedasfactorsofsafetyandprovideforvariouscontingenciesanduncertaintieswhicharediscussedingreaterdetail in Section 13.2.Ch13-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 24 400 Airworthiness Fig. 13.1 Flight envelope Table 13.1 Category Load factor nNormal Semi-aerobatic Aerobatic n1 2.1+24000/(W+10000) 4.5 6.0 n2 0.75n1butn2\<2.0 3.1 4.5 n3 1.0 1.8 3.0 Thebasicstrengthandﬂightperformancelimitsforaparticularaircraftareselected bytheairworthinessauthoritiesandarecontainedinthe ﬂightenvelope orV−ndiagram shown in Fig. 13.1.

Flight envelopes are therefore drawn for a range of altitudes from sea level to theoperational ceiling of the aircraft. 13.2 Load factor determination Severalproblemsrequiresolutionbeforevaluesforthevariousloadfactorsintheﬂightenvelope can be determined.The limit load, for example, may be produced by a spec-iﬁed manoeuvre or by an encounter with a particularly severe gust (gust cases and theassociatedgustenvelopearediscussedinSection14.4).Clearlysomeknowledgeofpos-siblegustconditionsisrequiredtodeterminethelimitingcase.Furthermore,theﬁxingoftheproofandultimatefactorsalsodependsuponthedegreeofuncertaintyofdesign,variations in structural strength, structural deterioration, etc.We shall now investigatesome of these problems to see their comparative inﬂuence on load factor values. 13.2.1 Limit load Anaircraftissubjectedtoavarietyofloadsduringitsoperationallife,themainclassesof whichare:manoeuvreloads,gustloads,undercarriageloads,cabinpressureloads,buf-feting and induced vibrations. Of these, manoeuvre, undercarriage and cabin pressureloads are determined with reasonable simplicity since manoeuvre loads are controlleddesign cases, undercarriages are designed for given maximum descent rates and cabinpressures are speciﬁed. The remaining loads depend to a large extent on the atmo-spheric conditions encountered during ﬂight. Estimates of the magnitudes of suchloads are only possible therefore if in-ﬂight data on these loads is available. It obvi-ouslyrequiresagreatnumberofhoursofﬂyingiftheexperimentaldataaretoincludepossible extremes of atmospheric conditions. In practice, the amount of data requiredtoestablishtheprobableperiodofﬂighttimebeforeanaircraftencounters,say,agustload of a given severity, is a great deal more than that available. It therefore becomesa problem in statistics to extrapolate the available data and calculate the probabilityof an aircraft being subjected to its proof or ultimate load during its operational life. The aim would be for a zero or negligible rate of occurrence of its ultimate load and an extremely low rate of occurrence of its proof load. Having decided on an ultimateload, then the limit load may be ﬁxed as deﬁned in Section 13.1 although the value ofthe ultimate factor includes, as we have already noted, allowances for uncertainties indesign, variation in structural strength and structural deterioration. 13.2.2 Uncertainties in design and structural deterioration Neitherofthesepresentsseriousproblemsinmodernaircraftconstructionandthereforedo not require large factors of safety to minimize their effects.

The problem of structural deterioration due to corrosion and wear may be largely eliminatedbycloseinspectionduringserviceandtheapplicationofsuitableprotective treatments. 13.2.3 Variation in structural strength To minimize the effect of the variation in structural strength between two apparently identical components, strict controls are employed in the manufacture of materialsand in the fabrication of the structure. Material control involves the observance ofstrict limits in chemical composition and close supervision of manufacturing methodssuch as machining, heat treatment, rolling, etc. In addition, the inspection of samplesby visual, radiographic and other means, and the carrying out of strength tests onspecimens,enablebelowlimitbatchestobeisolatedandrejected.Thus,ifasampleofabatchofmaterialfallsbelowaspeciﬁedminimumstrengththenthebatchisrejected.

Similarprecautionsareappliedtoassembledstructureswithregardtodimensiontol- erances,qualityofassembly,welding,etc.Again,visualandotherinspectionmethodsare employed and, in certain cases, strength tests are carried out on sample structures. 13.2.4 Fatigue Althoughadequateprecautionsaretakentoensurethatanaircraft’sstructurepossesses sufﬁcientstrengthtowithstandthemostsevereexpectedgustormanoeuvreload,therestillremainstheproblemoffatigue.Practicallyallcomponentsoftheaircraft’sstructurearesubjectedtoﬂuctuatingloadswhichoccuragreatmanytimesduringthelifeoftheaircraft.Ithasbeenknownformanyyearsthatmaterialsfailunderﬂuctuatingloadsatmuch lower values of stress than their normal static failure stress.

Prior to the mid-1940s little attention had been paid to fatigue considerations in the design of aircraft structures. It was felt that sufﬁcient static strength would eliminatethe possibility of fatigue failure. However, evidence began to accumulate that severalaircraftcrasheshadbeencausedbyfatiguefailure.Theseriousnessofthesituationwashighlighted in the early 1950s by catastrophic fatigue failures of two Comet airliners. These were caused by the once-per-ﬂight cabin pressurization cycle which produced circumferential and longitudinal stresses in the fuselage skin.Although these stresseswere well below the allowable stresses for single cycle loading, stress concentrationsoccurred at the corners of the windows and around rivets which raised local stressesCh13-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 24 13.2 Load factor determination 403 Fig. 13.2 Typical form of S–Ndiagram. considerablyabovethegeneralstresslevel.Repeatedcyclesofpressurizationproduced fatigue cracks which propagated disastrously, causing an explosion of the fuselage athigh altitude. Several factors contributed to the emergence of fatigue as a major factor in design. Forexample,aircraftspeedsandsizesincreased,callingforhigherwingandotherload-ings.

In conjunction with their fatigue strength testing, the RAE initiated research to develop a suitable instrument for counting and recording gust loads over long periodsof time. Such an instrument was developed by J. Taylor in 1950 and was designed sothat the response fell off rapidly above 10Hz.

For these purposes we shall suppose that an aircraftis a rigid body and represent it by a rigid mass, m, as shown in Fig. 14.1. We shall also, at this stage, consider motion in the plane of the mass which would correspondto pitching of the aircraft without roll or yaw. We shall also suppose that the centreof gravity (CG) of the mass has coordinates ¯x,¯yreferred to xandyaxes having an arbitraryoriginO;themassisrotatingaboutanaxisthroughOperpendiculartothe xy plane with a constant angular velocity ω.

Similarly, if the CG lies on the yaxis, Fx=0. Clearly, if O coincides with the CG, ¯x=¯y=0 andFx=Fy=0.

In symmetric manoeuvres we consider the motion of the aircraft initiated by move- ment of the control surfaces in the plane of symmetry. Examples of such manoeuvresare loops, straight pull-outs and bunts, and the calculations involve the determinationof lift, drag and tailplane loads at given ﬂight speeds and altitudes. The effects ofatmospheric turbulence and gusts are discussed in Section 14.4. 14.2.1 Level ﬂight Although steady level ﬂight is not a manoeuvre in the strict sense of the word, it is a useful condition to investigate initially since it establishes points of load appli-cation and gives some idea of the equilibrium of an aircraft in the longitudinal plane.

However, other parameters in these equations, suchasM 0, depend upon the wing incidence αwhich in turn is a function of the required wing lift so that, in practice, a method of successive approximation is found to be themost convenient means of solution.

Again the method of successive approximation is found to be most convenient for the solution of Eqs (14.12)–(14.14). There is, however, a difference to the proceduredescribed for the steady level ﬂight case. The engine thrust Tis no longer directly related to the drag Das the latter changes during the manoeuvre.

The movements of the air in turbulence are generally known as gusts and produce changes in wing incidence, thereby subjecting the aircraft to sudden orgradual increases or decreases in lift from which normal accelerations result.

The calculation of the complete response of the aircraft to a ‘graded’gust may be obtained from its response to a ‘sharp-edged’or ‘step’gust, by treating the former ascomprisingalargenumberofsmall‘steps’andsuperimposingtheresponsestoeachofthese. Such a process is known as convolution or Duhamel integration.This treatmentis desirable for large or unorthodox aircraft where aeroelastic (structural ﬂexibility)effectsongustloadsmaybeappreciableorunknown.Insuchcasestheassumptionofa rigid aircraft may lead to an underestimation of gust loads.The equations of motionare therefore modiﬁed to allow for aeroelastic in addition to aerodynamic effects. Forsmallandmedium-sizedaircrafthavingorthodoxaerodynamicfeaturestheequivalent‘sharp-edged’gust procedure is satisfactory. While the ‘graded’or ‘ramp’gust is used as a basis for gust load calculations, other shapes of gust proﬁle are in current use. Typical of these is the ‘l −cosine’ gust of Fig.14.11(c),wherethegustvelocity uisgivenby u(t)=(U/2)[l−cos(πt/T)].Again the aircraft response is determined by superimposing the responses to each of a largenumber of small steps. Although the ‘discrete’ gust approach still ﬁnds widespread use in the calculation of gust loads, alternative methods based on power spectral analysis are being investi- gated.Theadvantageofthepowerspectraltechniqueliesinitsfreedomfromarbitraryassumptions of gust shapes and sizes. It is assumed that gust velocity is a randomvariable which may be regarded for analysis as consisting of a large number of sinu-soidal components whose amplitudes vary with frequency. The power spectrum of such a function is then deﬁned as the distribution of energy over the frequency range. This may then be related to gust velocity. To establish appropriate amplitude and frequency distributions for a particular random gust proﬁle requires a large amountof experimental data. The collection of such data has been previously referred to inSection 13.2. Calculations of the complete response of an aircraft and detailed assessments of the ‘discrete’ gust and power spectral methods of analysis are outside the scope ofthis book. More information may be found in Refs [1–4] at the end of the chapter.Our present analysis is conﬁned to the ‘discrete’ gust approach, in which we con-sider the ‘sharp-edged’ gust and the equivalent ‘sharp-edged’ gust derived from the‘graded’gust. 14.4.1 ‘Sharp-edged’ gust The simplifying assumptions introduced in the determination of gust loads resulting from the ‘sharp-edged’ gust, have been discussed in the earlier part of this section.Ch14-H6739.tex 25/1/2007 17: 1 14.4 Gust loads 421 Fig. 14.12 Increase in wing incidence due to a sharp-edged gust.

It follows that high speed aircraftwithlowormoderatewingloadingsaremostlikelytobeaffectedbygustloads. The contribution to normal acceleration of the change in tail load produced by the gust may be calculated using the same assumptions as before. However, the changein tailplane incidence is not equal to the change in wing incidence due to downwasheffects at the tail.Thus if /Delta1Pis the increase (or decrease) in tailplane load, then /Delta1P= 1 2ρ0V2 EST/Delta1CL,T (14.29) whereSTis the tailplane area and /Delta1CL,Tthe increment of tailplane lift coefﬁcient given by /Delta1CL,T=∂CL,T ∂αuE VE(14.30) inwhich ∂CL,T/∂αistherateofchangeoftailplaneliftcoefﬁcientwithwingincidence.

Also, the gust alleviation factor in the‘graded’gust case becomes F 1and includes allowances for the aerodynamic yawing moment produced by the gust and the yawing inertia of the aircraft. 14.4.3 Gust envelope Airworthinessrequirementsusuallyspecifythatgustloadsshallbecalculatedatcertain combinations of gust and ﬂight speed.

For example,A and F denote speeds at which a gust of velocity ±U1would stall the wing. The lift coefﬁcient–incidence curve is, as we noted in connection with the ﬂight envelope, affected by compressibility and therefore altitude so that a series of gustenvelopesshouldbedrawnfordifferentaltitudes.Anadditionalvariableintheequationsfor gust load factor is the wing loading w. Further gust envelopes should therefore be drawn to represent different conditions of aircraft loading.

Fig. P.14.8Ch15-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 27 15 Fatigue Fatigue has been discussed brieﬂy in Section 11.7 when we examined the properties of materials and also in Section 13.4 as part of the chapter on airworthiness.We shallnowlookatfatigueingreaterdetailandconsiderfactorsaffectingthelifeofanaircraftincludingsafelifeandfailsafestructures,designingagainstfatigue,thefatiguestrengthof components, the prediction of aircraft fatigue life and crack propagation. Fatigue is deﬁned as the progressive deterioration of the strength of a material or structural component during service such that failure can occur at much lower stresslevelsthantheultimatestresslevel.Aswehaveseen,fatigueisadynamicphenomenonwhich initiates small (micro) cracks in the material or component and causes them togrowintolarge(macro)cracks;these,ifnotdetected,canresultincatastrophicfailure. Fatigue damage can be produced in a variety of ways. Cyclic fatigue is caused by repeatedﬂuctuatingloads. Corrosionfatigue isfatigueacceleratedbysurfacecorrosion of the material penetrating inwards so that the material strength deteriorates. Small-scale rubbing movements and abrasion of adjacent parts cause fretting fatigue, while thermal fatigue is produced by stress ﬂuctuations induced by thermal expansions and contractions;thelatterdoesnotincludetheeffectonmaterialstrengthofheat.Finally,high frequency stress ﬂuctuations, due to vibrations excited by jet or propeller noise,causesonicoracoustic fatigue. Clearly an aircraft’s structure must be designed so that fatigue does not become a problem. For aircraft in general, the requirements that the strength of an aircraftthroughout its operational life shall be such as to ensure that the possibility of a dis-astrous fatigue failure shall be extremely remote (i.e. the probability of failure is lessthan 10 −7) under the action of the repeated loads of variable magnitude expected in service.Alsoitisrequiredthattheprincipalpartsoftheprimarystructureoftheaircraftbe subjected to a detailed analysis and to load tests which demonstrate a safe life,o r thatthepartsoftheprimarystructurehave fail-safecharacteristics.Theserequirements do not apply to light aircraft provided that zinc-rich aluminium alloys are not used intheirconstructionandthatwingstresslevelsarekeptlow,i.e.providedthata3.05m/supgust causes no greater stress than 14N/mm 15.1 Safe life and fail-safe structures The danger of a catastrophic fatigue failure in the structure of an aircraft may be eliminatedcompletelyormaybecomeextremelyremoteifthestructureisdesignedtoCh15-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 27 430 Fatigue haveasafelifeortobefail-safe.Intheformerapproach,thestructureisdesignedtohave aminimumlifeduringwhichitisknownthatnocatastrophicdamagewilloccur.Attheend of this life the structure must be replaced even though there may be no detectablesigns of fatigue. If a structural component is not economically replaceable when itssafelifehasbeenreachedthecompletestructuremustbewrittenoff.Alternatively,itispossibleforeasilyreplaceablecomponentssuchasundercarriagelegsandmechanismsto have a safe life less than that of the complete aircraft since it would probably bemore economical to use, say, two lightweight undercarriage systems during the life oftheaircraftratherthancarryaheavierundercarriagewhichhasthesamesafelifeastheaircraft. The fail-safe approach relies on the fact that the failure of a member in a redundant structure does not necessarily lead to the collapse of the complete structure, providedthattheremainingmembersareabletocarrytheloadshedbythefailedmemberandcanwithstandfurtherrepeatedloadsuntilthepresenceofthefailedmemberisdiscovered.Such a structure is called a fail-safe structure or a damage tolerant structure. Generally, it is more economical to design some parts of the structure to be fail- safe rather than to have a long safe life since such components can be lighter. Whenfailureisdetected,eitherthrougharoutineinspectionorbysomemalfunction,suchasfuelleakagefromawingcrack,theparticularaircraftmaybetakenoutofserviceandrepaired.However,thestructuremustbedesignedandtheinspectionintervalsarrangedsuchthatafailure,forexampleacrack,toosmalltobenoticedatoneinspectionmustnotincreasetoacatastrophicsizebeforethenext.Thedeterminationofcrackpropagationrates is discussed later. Some components must be designed to have a safe life; these include landing gear, major wing joints, wing–fuselage joints and hinges on all-moving tailplanes or onvariable geometry wings. Components which may be designed to be fail-safe includewing skins which are stiffened by stringers and fuselage skins which are stiffened byframesandstringers;thestringersandframespreventskincracksspreadingdisastrouslyfor a sufﬁcient period of time for them to be discovered at a routine inspection. 15.2 Designing against fatigue Various precautions may be taken to ensure that an aircraft has an adequate fatigue life. We have seen in Chapter 11 that the early aluminium–zinc alloys possessed highultimate and proof stresses but were susceptible to early failure under fatigue loading;choiceofmaterialsisthereforeimportant.Thenaturallyagedaluminium–copperalloyspossess good fatigue resistance but with lower static strengths. Modern research isconcentrating on alloys which combine high strength with high fatigue resistance. Attention to detail design is equally important. Stress concentrations can arise at sharp corners and abrupt changes in section. Fillets should therefore be provided atre-entrant corners, and cut-outs, such as windows and access panels, should be rein-forced. In machined panels the material thickness should be increased around boltholes, while holes in primary bolted joints should be reamered to improve surface ﬁn-ish;surfacescratchesandmachinemarksaresourcesoffatiguecrackinitiation.Jogglesin highly stressed members should be avoided while asymmetry can cause additionalstresses due to bending.Ch15-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 27 15.2 Designing against fatigue 431 In addition to sound structural and detail design, an estimation of the number, fre- quencyandmagnitudeoftheﬂuctuatingloadsanaircraftencountersisnecessary.The fatigue load spectrum begins when the aircraft taxis to its take-off position. During taxiingtheaircraftmaybemanoeuvringoverunevengroundwithafullpayloadsothatwingstresses,forexample,aregreaterthaninthestaticcase.Also,duringtake-offandclimbanddescentandlandingtheaircraftissubjectedtothegreatestloadﬂuctuations. The undercarriage is retracted and lowered; ﬂaps are raised and lowered; there is the impact on landing; the aircraft has to carry out manoeuvres; and, ﬁnally, the aircraft,as we shall see, experiences a greater number of gusts than during the cruise. Theloadscorrespondingtothesevariousphasesmustbecalculatedbeforetheasso- ciated stresses can be obtained. For example, during take-off, wing bending stressesandshearstressesduetoshearandtorsionarebasedonthetotalweightoftheaircraftincludingfullfueltanks,andmaximumpayloadallfactoredby1.2toallowforabumpduring each take-off on a hard runway or by 1.5 for a take-off from grass. The loadsproducedduringlevelﬂightandsymmetricmanoeuvresarecalculatedusingthemeth-ods described in Section 14.2. From these values distributions of shear force, bendingmoment and torque may be found in, say, the wing by integrating the lift distribution.Loads due to gusts are calculated using the methods described in Section 14.4. Thus,duetoasingleequivalentsharp-edgedgusttheloadfactorisgiveneitherbyEq(14.25)or Eq (14.26). Althoughitisarelativelysimplemattertodeterminethenumberofloadﬂuctuations during a ground–air–ground cycle caused by standard operations such as raising andlowering ﬂaps, retracting and lowering the undercarriage, etc., it is more difﬁcult toestimate the number and magnitude of gusts an aircraft will encounter. For example,there is a greater number of gusts at low altitude (during take-off, climb and descent)thanathighaltitude(duringcruise).Terrain(sea,ﬂatland,mountains)alsoaffectsthenumber and magnitude of gusts as does weather. The use of radar enables aircraft toavoidcumuluswheregustsareprevalent,buthaslittleeffectatlowaltitudeintheclimbanddescentwherecloudscannoteasilybeavoided.TheESDU(EngineeringSciencesData Unit) has produced gust data based on information collected by gust recorderscarried by aircraft. These show, in graphical form (l 10versushcurves,his altitude), theaveragedistanceﬂownatvariousaltitudesforagusthavingavelocitygreaterthan±3.05m/s to be encountered. In addition, gust frequency curves give the number of gusts of a given velocity per 1000 gusts of velocity 3.05m/s. Combining both sets ofdataenablesthe gustexceedance tobecalculated,i.e.thenumberofgustcycleshaving avelocitygreaterthanorequaltoagivenvelocityencounteredperkilometreofﬂight. Since an aircraft is subjected to the greatest number of load ﬂuctuations during taxi–take-off–climbanddescent–standoff–landingwhilelittledamageiscausedduringcruise,thefatiguelifeofanaircraftdoesnotdependonthenumberofﬂyinghoursbutonthenumberofﬂights.However,theoperationalrequirementsofaircraftdifferfromclass to class. TheAirbus is required to have a life free from fatigue cracks of 24000ﬂightsor30000hours,whileitseconomicrepairlifeis48000ﬂightsor60000hours;itslandinggear,however,isdesignedforasafelifeof32000ﬂights,afterwhichitmustbe replaced. On the other hand the BAe 146, with a greater number of shorter ﬂightsperdaythantheAirbus,hasaspeciﬁedcrackfreelifeof40000ﬂightsandaneconomicrepair life of 80000 ﬂights.Although the above ﬁgures are operational requirements,the nature of fatigue is such that it is unlikely that all of a given type of aircraft willCh15-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 27 432 Fatigue satisfythem.OfthetotalnumberofAirbusaircraft,atleast90%willachievetheabove values and 50% will be better; clearly, frequent inspections are necessary during anaircraft’s life. 15.3 Fatigue strength of components In Section 13.2.4 we discussed the effect of stress level on the number of cycles tofailure of a material such as mild steel.As the stress level is decreased the number ofcycles to failure increases, resulting in a fatigue endurance curve (the S–Ncurve) of thetypeshowninFig.13.2.Suchacurvecorrespondstotheaveragevalueof Nateach stress amplitude since there will be a wide range of values of Nfor the given stress; evenundercarefullycontrolledconditionstheratioofmaximum Ntominimum Nmay be as high as 10:1. Two other curves may therefore be drawn, as shown in Fig. 15.1,enveloping all or nearly all the experimental results; these curves are known as theconﬁdencelimits .If99.9percentofalltheresultsliebetweenthecurves,i.e.only1in 1000 falls outside, they represent the 99.9 per cent conﬁdence limits. If 99.99999 percent of results lie between the curves only 1 in 10 7results will fall outside them and they represent the 99.99999 per cent conﬁdence limits.

The damaging portion of a ﬂuctuating load cycle occurs when the stress is tensile; thiscausescrackstoopenandgrow.Therefore,ifasteadytensilestressissuperimposed onacyclicstressthemaximumtensilestressduringthecyclewillbeincreasedandthenumberofcyclestofailurewilldecrease.Conversely,ifthesteadystressiscompressivethe maximum tensile stress will decrease and the number of cycles to failure willincrease.

In Fig. 15.2, S ais the allowable stress amplitude, Sa,0is the stress amplitude required to produce fatigue failure at Ncycles with zero mean stress, Smisthemeanstressand Sutheultimatetensilestress.If Sm=Suanycyclicstresswill cause failure, while if Sm=0 the allowable stress amplitude is Sa,0. The equation of the straight line portion of the diagram is Sa Sa,0=/parenleftbigg 1−Sm Su/parenrightbigg (15.3) Experimental evidence suggests a non-linear relationship for particular materials.Equation (15.3) then becomes S a Sa,0=/bracketleftbigg 1−/parenleftbiggSm Su/parenrightbiggm/bracketrightbigg (15.4) in whichmlies between 0.6 and 2. Fig. 15.2 Goodman diagram.Ch15-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 27 434 Fatigue In practical situations, fatigue is not caused by a large number of identical stress cycles but by many different stress amplitude cycles. The prediction of the number of cycles to failure therefore becomes complex. Miner and Palmgren have proposedalinear cumulative damage law as follows. If Ncycles of stress amplitude S acause fatiguefailurethen1cycleproduces1/ Nofthetotaldamagetocausefailure.Therefore, ifrdifferent cycles are applied in which a stress amplitude Sj(j=1,2,...,r) would causefailurein Njcyclesthenumberofcycles njrequiredtocausetotalfatiguefailure is given by r/summationdisplay j=1nj Nj=1 (15.5) Although S–Ncurvesmaybereadilyobtainedfordifferentmaterialsbytestingalarge number of small specimens ( coupon tests ), it is not practicable to adopt the same approachforaircraftcomponentssincetheseareexpensivetomanufactureandthetestprogrammetooexpensivetorunforlongperiodsoftime.However,suchaprogrammewasinitiatedintheearly1950stotestthewingsandtailplanesofMeteorandMustangﬁghters.Theseweresubjectedtoconstantamplitudeloadinguntilfailurewithdifferentspecimensbeingtestedatdifferentloadlevels.Stressesweremeasuredatpointswherefatigue was expected (and actually occurred) and S–Ncurves plotted for the complete structure. The curves had the usual appearance and at low stress levels had such largeendurancesthatfatiguedidnotoccur;thusafatiguelimitexisted.ItwasfoundthattheaverageS–Ncurve could be approximated to by the equation S a=10.3(1+1000/√ N) (15.6) in which the mean stress was 90N/mm2. In general terms, Eq. (15.6) may be written as Sa=S∞(1+C/√ N) (15.7) in which S∞is the fatigue limit and Cis a constant. Thus Sa→S∞asN→∞. Equation (15.7) may be rearranged to give the endurance directly, i.e. N=C2/parenleftbiggS∞ Sa−S∞/parenrightbigg2 (15.8) which shows clearly that as Sa→S∞,N→∞.

Rearranging Eq.

(15.13) for S/prime ∞,mfrom Eq. (15.12) we have Sa=Sa,m (1+C/√ N/prime)(1+C/√ N) (15.14) in whichN/primeis given by Eq. (15.11). Equation (15.14) will be based on a few test results so that a ‘safe’fatigue strength isusuallytakentobethreestandarddeviationsbelowthemeanfatiguestrength.Hence we introduce a scatter factor K n(>1) to allow for this; Eq. (15.14) then becomes SaSa,m Kn(1+C/√ N/prime)(1+C/√ N) (15.15) Knvaries with the number of test results available and for a coefﬁcient of variation of 0.1,Kn=1.45 for 6 specimens, Kn=1.445 for 10 specimens, Kn=1.44 for 20 specimensandfor100specimensormore Kn=1.43.Fortypical S–Ncurvesascatter factor of 1.43 is equivalent to a life factor of 3 to 4. 15.4 Prediction of aircraft fatigue life Wehaveseenthatanaircraftsuffersfatiguedamageduringallphasesoftheground–air– ground cycle. The various contributions to this damage may be calculated separatelyand hence the safe life of the aircraft in terms of the number of ﬂights calculated.

Suppose that a gust of velocity uecauses a stress Suabout a mean stress corresponding to level ﬂight, and suppose also that the number of stress cyclesofthismagnituderequiredtocausefailureis N(S u);thedamagecausedbyonecycleis then1/N(Su).ThereforefromthePalmgren–Minerhypothesis,whensufﬁcientgustsof thisandallothermagnitudestogetherwiththeeffectsofallotherloadcyclesproduceacumulative damage of 1.0, fatigue failure will occur. It is therefore necessary to knowthe number and magnitude of gusts likely to be encountered in ﬂight. Gustdatahavebeenaccumulatedoveranumberofyearsfromaccelerometerrecords fromaircraftﬂyingoverdifferentroutesandterrains,atdifferentheightsandatdifferentseasons.The ESDU data sheets 1present the data in two forms, as we have previously noted. First, l10against altitude curves show the distance which must be ﬂown at a givenaltitudeinorderthatagust(positiveornegative)havingavelocity ≥3.05m/sbe encountered. It follows that 1/ l10is the number of gusts encountered in unit distance (1km)ataparticularheight.Secondly,gustfrequencydistributioncurves, r(ue)against ue, give the number of gusts of velocity uefor every 1000 gusts of velocity 3.05m/s. From these two curves the gust exceedance E(ue) is obtained; E(ue) is the number oftimesagustofagivenmagnitude( ue)willbeequalledorexceededin1kmofﬂight. Thus, from the above number of gusts ≥3.05m/s per km =1/l10 number of gusts equal to ueper 1000 gusts equal to 3 .05m/s=r(ue) Hence number of gusts equal to ueper single gust equal to 3 .05m/s=r(ue)/1000 It follows that the gust exceedance E(ue)i sg i v e nb y E(ue)=r(ue) 1000l10(15.17) inwhichl10isdependentonheight.Agoodapproximationforthecurveof r(ue)against uein the region ue=3.05m/s is r(ue)=3.23×105u−5.26 e (15.18) Consider now the typical gust exceedance curve shown in Fig. 15.3.

Half of these gusts will be positive (upgusts) and half negative (downgusts)sothatifitisassumedthateachupgustisfollowedbyadowngustofequal magnitude the number of complete gust cycles will be −δE(ue)/2. Suppose that each cycle produces a stress S(ue) and that the number of these cycles required to produce failure is N(Su,e).The damage caused by one cycle is then 1/N (Su,e) and over the gust velocity interval δuethe total damage δDis given by δD=−δE(ue) 2N(Su,e)=−dE(ue) dueδue 2N(Su,e)(15.19) Integrating Eq.

[2]) (15.29) in which f(θ) is a different function for each of the three stresses and Kis thestress intensity factor ;Kis a function of the nature and magnitude of the applied stress levels and also of the crack size.The terms (2 πr)1 2andf(θ) map the stress ﬁeld in theCh15-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 27 15.5 Crack propagation 441 Fig. 15.4 Basic modes of crack growth.

Equation (15.29) applies to all modes of crack opening, with Khaving different values depending on the geometry of the structure, the nature of the applied loads andthe type of crack. Experimental data show that crack growth and residual strength data are better cor- related using Kthan any other parameter. Kmay be expressed as a function of the nominal applied stress Sand the crack length in the form K=S(πa)1 2α (15.30) in which αis a non-dimensional coefﬁcient usually expressed as the ratio of crack lengthtoanyconvenientlocaldimensionintheplaneofthecomponent;foracrackinaninﬁniteplateunderanapplieduniformstresslevel Sremotefromthecrack, α=1.0.Ch15-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 27 442 Fatigue Alternatively, in cases where opposing loads Pare applied at points close to the plane of the crack K=Pα (πa)1 2(15.31) in which Pis the load/unit thickness. Equations (15.30) and (15.31) may be rewritten as K=K0α (15.32) whereK0is a reference value of the stress intensity factor which depends upon the loading. For the simple case of a remotely loaded plate in tension K0=S(πa)1 2 (15.33) and Eqs (15.32) and (15.30) are identical so that for a given ratio of crack length to platewidth αisthesameinbothformulations.Inmorecomplexcases,forexamplethe in-plane bending of a plate of width 2 band having a central crack of length 2 a K0=3Ma 4b3(πa)1 2 (15.34) in which Mis the bending moment per unit thickness.

Use of Eqs(15.30)–(15.32)dependsontheformofthesolutionfor K0andcaremustbetaken to ensure that the formula used and the way in which the nominal stress is deﬁned arecompatible with those used in the derivation of α. There are a number of methods available for determining the value of Kandα.I n one method the solution for a component subjected to more than one type of loadingis obtained from available standard solutions using superposition or, if the geometryis not covered, two or more standard solutions may be compounded. 1Alternatively, a ﬁnite element analysis may be used. The coefﬁcient αin Eq. (15.30) has, as we have noted, different values depending on the plate and crack geometries. Listed below are values of αfor some of the more common cases. (i) A semi-inﬁnite plate having an edge crack of length a;α=1.12.

(1.40), the direct stressσzin the ﬁbre ST is given by σz=−Ey R(16.2) Thedirectornormalforceonthecross-sectionoftheﬁbreSTis σzδA.However,since the direct stress in the beam section is due to a pure bending moment, in other wordsthere is no axial load, the resultant normal force on the complete cross-section of thebeam must be zero.Then/integraldisplay AσzdA=0 (16.3) whereAis the area of the beam cross-section.

Thus we see that the neutral axis passes through the centroid of area of the cross-section. Since the yaxis in this case is also an axis of symmetry, it must also pass through the centroid of thecross-section. Hence the origin, O, of the coordinate axes, coincides with the centroidof area of the cross-section. Equation (16.2) shows that for a sagging (i.e. negative) bending moment the direct stressinthebeamsectionisnegative(i.e.compressive)when yispositiveandpositive (i.e. tensile) when yis negative. Considernowtheelementalstrip δAinFig.16.4(b);thisis,infact,thecross-section of the ﬁbre ST. The strip is above the neutral axis so that there will be a compressive force acting on its cross-section of σ zδAwhich isnumerically equal to (Ey/R )δAfrom Eq. (16.2).

Rewriting Eq. (16.6) we have M=−EI R(16.7) or, combining this expression with Eq. (16.2) M I=−E R=σz y(16.8) From Eq. (16.8) we see that σz=My I(16.9) The direct stress, σz, at any point in the cross-section of a beam is therefore directly proportional to the distance of the point from the neutral axis and so varies linearly throughthedepthofthebeamasshown,forthesectionJK,inFig.16.5(b).Clearly,forapositivebendingmoment σ zispositive,i.e.tensile,when yispositiveandcompressive (i.e. negative) when yis negative.Thus in Fig. 16.5(b) σz,1=My1 I(compression) σz,2=My2 I(tension) (16.10) Furthermore, we see from Eq. (16.7) that the curvature, 1 /R, of the beam is given by 1 R=M EI(16.11) and is therefore directly proportional to the applied bending moment and inverselyproportional to the product EIwhich is known as the ﬂexural rigidity of the beam. Example 16.1 The cross-section of a beam has the dimensions shown in Fig. 16.6(a). If the beam is subjected to a negative bending moment of 100kNm applied in a vertical plane,determine the distribution of direct stress through the depth of the section. The cross-section of the beam is doubly symmetrical so that the centroid, C, of the section, and therefore the origin of axes, coincides with the mid-point of the web.Furthermore, the bending moment is applied to the beam section in a vertical planeso that the xaxis becomes the neutral axis of the beam section; we therefore need to calculate the second moment of area, I xx, about this axis. Ixx=200×3003 12−175×2603 12=193.7×106mm4(see Section 16.4) From Eq.

Again from Section 16.4 Iyy=2×20×2003 12+260×253 12=27.0×106mm4 Hence, substituting for MandIyyin Eq.

Again thedistribution is linear and varies from 3.7 ×(−100)=−370N/mm 2(compression) at the left-hand edges of each ﬂange to 3 .7×(+100)=+370N/mm2(tension) at the right-hand edges. Wenotethatthemaximumstressesinthisexampleareverymuchgreaterthanthose inExample16.1.Thisisduetothefactthatthebulkofthematerialinthebeamsectionis concentrated in the region of the neutral axis where the stresses are low. The use ofan I-section in this manner would therefore be structurally inefﬁcient. Example 16.3 The beam section of Example 16.1 is subjected to a bending moment of 100kNm appliedinaplaneparalleltothelongitudinalaxisofthebeambutinclinedat30◦tothe left of vertical. The sense of the bending moment is clockwise when viewed from theleft-hand edge of the beam section. Determine the distribution of direct stress. The bending moment is ﬁrst resolved into two components, M xin a vertical plane andMyin a horizontal plane. Equation (16.9) may then be written in two forms σz=Mx Ixxyσz=My Iyyx (i) The separate distributions can then be determined and superimposed. A more direct method is to combine the two equations (i) to give the total direct stress at any point(x,y) in the section.Thus σ z=Mx Ixxy+My Iyyx (ii) Now Mx=100cos30◦=86.6kNm My=100sin30◦=50.0kNm/bracerightbigg (iii) Mxis, in this case, a positive bending moment producing tension in the upper half of thebeamwhere yispositive.Also Myproducestensionintheleft-handhalfofthebeam wherexisnegative;weshallthereforecall Myanegativebendingmoment.Substituting thevaluesof MxandMyfromEq.(iii)butwiththeappropriatesigninEq.(ii)together with the values of IxxandIyyfrom Examples 16.1 and 16.2 we obtain σz=86.6×106 193.7×106y−50.0×106 27.0×106x (iv) or σz=0.45y−1.85x (v) Equation(v)givesthevalueofdirectstressatanypointinthecross-sectionofthebeamand may also be used to determine the distribution over any desired portion.

It may also be noted thatin Eq. (16.21) σ z=0 when, for the ﬁrst equation, y=0 and for the second equation whenx=0. Therefore, in symmetrical bending theory the xaxis becomes the neutral axis when My=0 and the yaxis becomes the neutral axis when Mx=0.

It is therefore necessary to know thelocation of the shear centre in all types of section or to calculate its position. Wherea cross-section has an axis of symmetry the shear centre must, of course, lie on thisaxis.ForcruciformoranglesectionsofthetypeshowninFig.17.8theshearcentreislocated at the intersection of the sides since the resultant internal shear loads all passthrough these points.Ch17-H6739.tex 25/1/2007 14: 7 17.2 Shear of open section beams 511 Fig. 17.8 Shear centre position for type of open section beam shown. Example 17.2 Calculate the position of the shear centre of the thin-walled channel section shown in Fig. 17.9.The thickness tof the walls is constant. The shear centre S lies on the horizontal axis of symmetry at some distance ξS, say, from the web.

S yappears on both sides of the resulting equation and may therefore be eliminated to leave ξS. For the channel section, Cx is an axis of symmetry so that Ixy=0.AlsoSx=0 and therefore Eq.

From symmetry it is clear that themoments of the resultant shears on the top and bottom ﬂanges about the mid-pointof the web are numerically equal and act in the same rotational sense. Furthermore,the moment of the web shear about the same point is zero. We deduce that it is onlynecessary to obtain the shear ﬂow distribution on either the top or bottom ﬂange for asolution.Alternatively,choosingaweb/ﬂangejunctionasamomentcentreleadstothesame conclusion.

Consider the closed section beam of arbitrary section shown in Fig. 17.10. The shear loads SxandSyare applied through any point in the cross-section and, in general, cause direct bending stressesand shear ﬂows which are related by the equilibrium equation (17.2).We assume thathoop stresses and body forces are absent.Therefore ∂q ∂s+t∂σz ∂z=0 From this point the analysis is identical to that for a shear loaded open section beamuntil we reach the stage of integrating Eq.

(17.15) in the form qs=qb+qs,0 (17.16)Ch17-H6739.tex 25/1/2007 14: 7 514 Shear of beams Fig. 17.11 (a) Determination of qs,0; (b) equivalent loading on ‘open’ section beam.

In this case theconstant shear ﬂow q s,0corresponds to the torque but will have different values for different positions of the ‘cut’since the corresponding various ‘open’section beamswill have different locations for their shear centres. An additional effect of ‘cutting’the beam is to produce a statically determinate structure since the q bshear ﬂows are obtained from statical equilibrium considerations. It follows that a single cell closedsection beam supporting shear loads is singly redundant. 17.3.1 Twist and warping of shear loaded closed section beams Shear loads which are not applied through the shear centre of a closed section beamcause cross-sections to twist and warp; i.e., in addition to rotation, they suffer out ofplaneaxialdisplacements.Expressionsforthesequantitiesmaybederivedintermsoftheshearﬂowdistribution q sasfollows.Since q=τtandτ=Gγ(seeChapter1)then we can express qsin terms of the warping and tangential displacements wandvtof a point in the beam wall by using Eq.

For unsymmetrical sections the originforsmay be chosen arbitrarily. The resulting warping distribution will have exactly the same form as the actual distribution but will be displaced axially by the unknownwarping displacement at the origin for s. This value may be found by referring to the torsion of closed section beams subject to axial constraint (see Section 26.3). In theanalysis of such beams it is assumed that the direct stress distribution set up bythe constraint is directly proportional to the free warping of the section, i.e. σ=constant ×w Also, since a pure torque is applied the resultant of any internal direct stress system must be zero, in other words it is self-equilibrating.Thus Resultant axial load =/contintegraldisplay σtdsCh17-H6739.tex 25/1/2007 14: 7 17.3 Shear of closed section beams 517 where σis the direct stress at any point in the cross-section.

However, a difﬁculty arises in obtaining qs,0since, at this stage, it is impossible to equate internal and external moments to produce an equation similarto Eq.

We shall use the results of this analysis to investigate the torsion of thin-walledopensectionbeamsbutﬁrstweshallexaminethetorsionofthin-walledclosedsectionbeams since the theory for this relies on the general stress, strain and displacementrelationships which we established in Chapter 17. 18.1 Torsion of closed section beams A closed section beam subjected to a pure torque Tas shown in Fig. 18.1 does not, in the absence of an axial constraint, develop a direct stress system. It follows that theequilibrium conditions of Eqs (17.2) and (17.3) reduce to ∂q/∂s=0 and ∂q/∂z=0, respectively. These relationships may only be satisﬁed simultaneously by a constantvalueofq.Wededuce,therefore,thattheapplicationofapuretorquetoaclosedsection beam results in the development of a constant shear ﬂow in the beam wall. However,theshearstress τmayvaryaroundthecross-sectionsinceweallowthewallthickness tto be a function of s. The relationship between the applied torque and this constant shear ﬂow is simply derived by considering the torsional equilibrium of the sectionshown in Fig. 18.2.

Wehavenotedthatthelongitudinalstrain εziszeroinaclosedsectionbeamsubjected toapuretorque.Thismeansthatallsectionsofthebeammustpossessidenticalwarp-ing distributions. In other words longitudinal generators of the beam surface remainunchanged in length although subjected to axial displacement. Example 18.1 A thin-walled circular section beam has a diameter of 200mm and is 2m long; it is ﬁrmly restrained against rotation at each end. A concentrated torque of 30kNm isapplied to the beam at its mid-span point. If the maximum shear stress in the beam islimited to 200N /mm 2and the maximum angle of twist to 2◦, calculate the minimum thickness of the beam walls.Take G=25000N /mm2. Theminimumthicknessofthebeamcorrespondingtothemaximumallowableshear stress of 200N /mm2is obtained directly using Eq. (18.1) in which Tmax=15kNm.

Example 18.2 Determine the warping distribution in the doubly symmetrical rectangular, closed section beam, shown in Fig. 18.4, when subjected to an anticlockwise torque T. From symmetry the centre of twist R will coincide with the mid-point of the cross- section and points of zero warping will lie on the axes of symmetry at the mid-pointsof the sides.

Therefore, the variation in stress Fig. 20.1 Typical wing section.Ch20-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 36 20.2 Idealization of a panel 559 Fig. 20.2 Idealization of a wing section. over the cross-section of a stringer due to, say, bending of the wing would be small. Furthermore, the difference between the distances of the stringer centroids and theadjacent skin from the wing section axis is small. It would be reasonable to assumetherefore that the direct stress is constant over the stringer cross-sections. We couldtherefore replace the stringers and spar ﬂanges by concentrations of area, known asbooms, over which the direct stress is constant and which are located along the mid-lineoftheskin,asshowninFig.20.2.InwingandfuselagesectionsofthetypeshowninFig.20.1,thestringersandsparﬂangescarrymostofthedirectstresseswhiletheskinismainlyeffectiveinresistingshearstressesalthoughitalsocarriessomeofthedirectstresses.TheidealizationshowninFig.20.2maythereforebetakenastagefurtherbyassuming that all direct stresses are carried by the booms while the skin is effectiveonly in shear. The direct stress carrying capacity of the skin may be allowed for byincreasing each boom area by an area equivalent to the direct stress carrying capacityof the adjacent skin panels. The calculation of these equivalent areas will generallydepend upon an initial assumption as to the form of the distribution of direct stress ina boom/skin panel. 20.2 Idealization of a panel SupposethatwewishtoidealizethepanelofFig.20.3(a)intoacombinationofdirectstress carrying booms and shear stress only carrying skin as shown in Fig. 20.3(b).In Fig. 20.3(a) the direct stress carrying thickness t Dof the skin is equal to its actual thickness twhileinFig.20.3(b) tD=0.Supposealsothatthedirectstressdistribution in the actual panel varies linearly from an unknown value σ1to an unknown value σ2. Clearly the analysis should predict the extremes of stress σ1andσ2although the distribution of direct stress is obviously lost. Since the loading producing the direct stresses in the actual and idealized panels must be the same we can equate momentsto obtain expressions for the boom areas B 1andB2.

For axial load only σ1/σ2=1 andB1=B2=tDb/2; for a pure bendingmoment σ1/σ2=−1andB1=B2=tDb/6.Thus,differentidealizationsofthe same structure are required for different loading conditions.

Generally, in anyidealization, different loading conditions require different idealizations of the samestructure. In Example 20.1, the loading is applied in a vertical plane. If, however,the loading had been applied in a horizontal plane the assumed stress distribution inCh20-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 36 562 Structural idealization the panels of the section would have been different, resulting in different values of boom area. Suppose that an open or closed section beam is subjected to given bending or shear loads and that the required idealization has been completed.The analysis of such sec-tionsusuallyinvolvesthedeterminationoftheneutralaxispositionandthecalculationof sectional properties. The position of the neutral axis is derived from the conditionthat the resultant load on the beam cross-section is zero, i.e. /integraldisplay AσzdA=0 (see Eq. (16.3)) The area Ain this expression is clearly the direct stress carrying area. It follows that thecentroidofthecross-sectionisthecentroidofthedirectstresscarryingareaofthesection,dependingonthedegreeandmethodofidealization.Thesectionalproperties,I xx, etc., must also refer to the direct stress carrying area. 20.3.1 Bending of open and closed section beams TheanalysispresentedinSections16.1and16.2appliesandthedirectstressdistribution isgivenbyanyofEqs(16.9),(16.18)or(16.19),dependingonthebeamsectionbeinginvestigated.Intheseequationsthecoordinates( x,y)ofpointsinthecross-sectionare referred to axes having their origin at the centroid of the direct stress carrying area.Furthermore, the section properties I xx,IyyandIxyare calculated for the direct stress carrying area only. In the case where the beam cross-section has been completely idealized into direct stresscarryingboomsandshearstressonlycarryingpanels,thedirectstressdistributionconsists of a series of direct stresses concentrated at the centroids of the booms.

Equation (16.18) therefore reduces to σz=Mx Ixxy (i) The origin of axes C xycoincides with the position of the centroid of the direct stress carrying area which, in this case, is the centroid of the boom areas.

What remains is in facttheaverageoftheshearﬂow,ascanbeseenbyreferringtoExample20.3.Analysisofthe unidealized channel section would result in a parabolic distribution of shear ﬂowin the web 23 whose resultant is statically equivalent to the externally applied shearload of 4.8kN. In Fig. 20.8 the resultant of the constant shear ﬂow in the web 23 is12×400=4800N =4.8kN. It follows that this constant value of shear ﬂow is the average of the parabolically distributed shear ﬂows in the unidealized section. Theresult,fromtheidealizationofabeamsection,ofaconstantshearﬂowbetween booms may be used to advantage in parts of the analysis. Suppose that the curvedweb12inFig.20.9hasboomsatitsextremitiesandthattheshearﬂow q 12intheweb is constant. The shear force on an element δsof the web is q12δs, whose components horizontallyandverticallyare q12δscosφandq12δssinφ.Theresultant,paralleltothe xaxis,Sx,o fq12is therefore given by Sx=/integraldisplay2 1q12cosφds or Sx=q12/integraldisplay2 1cosφds which, from Fig. 20.9, may be written Sx=q12/integraldisplay2 1dx=q12(x2−x1) (20.7) Similarly the resultant of q12parallel to the yaxis is Sy=q12(y2−y1) (20.8)Ch20-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 36 568 Structural idealization Thus the resultant, in a given direction, of a constant shear ﬂow acting on a web is the value of the shear ﬂow multiplied by the projection on that direction of the web. The resultant shear force Son the web of Fig. 20.9 is S=/radicalBig S2x+S2y=q12/radicalBig (x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2 i.e. S=q12L12 (20.9) Therefore, the resultant shear force acting on the web is the product of the shear ﬂow and the length of the straight line joining the ends of the web; clearly the direction of the resultant is parallel to this line. The moment Mqproduced by the shear ﬂow q12about any point O in the plane of the web is, from Fig. 20.10 Mq=/integraldisplay2 1q12pds=q12/integraldisplay2 12dA or Mq=2Aq12 (20.10) inwhichAistheareaenclosedbythewebandthelinesjoiningtheendsofthewebto the point O.

If the tensile load had increased with decreasing zthe right-handsideoftheseequationswouldhavebeenpositive.Itfollowsthatinthecase where a compressive load increases with decreasing z, as for booms 1 and 2 in Fig. 20.13, the right-hand side is negative; similarly for booms 3 and 4 the right-hand sideis positive.Thus q 12=−6N/mm q23=−6+q12=−12N/mm and q34=+6+q23=−6N/mm giving the same solution as before.

It is therefore reasonable to assume that the shear ﬂow is constant betweenadjacent stringers so that the analysis simpliﬁes to the analysis of an idealized sectionin which the stringers/booms carry all the direct stresses while the skin is effectiveonly in shear. The direct stress carrying capacity of the skin may be allowed for byincreasing the stringer/boom areas as described in Section 20.3. The analysis of fuse-lages therefore involves the calculation of direct stresses in the stringers and the shearstress distributions in the skin; the latter are also required in the analysis of transverseframes, as we shall see in Chapter 24. 22.1 Bending The skin/stringer arrangement is idealized into one comprising booms and skin as describedinSection20.3.ThedirectstressineachboomisthencalculatedusingeitherEqs (16.18) or (16.19) in which the reference axes and the section properties refer tothe direct stress carrying areas of the cross-section.

The above analysis assumes that the web panels in beams of the type shown in Fig. 24.1 resist pure shear along their boundaries.

Fig. 24.7 Support of load having a component normal to a web. 24.2 Fuselage frames We have noted that fuselage frames transfer loads to the fuselage shell and provide column support for the longitudinal stringers. The frames generally take the form of open rings so that the interior of the fuselage is not obstructed. They are connectedcontinuously around their peripheries to the fuselage shell and are not necessarilycircular in form but will usually be symmetrical about a vertical axis. A fuselage frame is in equilibrium under the action of any external loads and the reaction shear ﬂows from the fuselage shell. Suppose that a fuselage frame has avertical axis of symmetry and carries a vertical external load W, as shown in Fig. 24.8(a) and (b). The fuselage shell/stringer section has been idealized such that thefuselageskiniseffectiveonlyinshear.Supposealsothattheshearforceinthefuselageimmediately to the left of the frame is S y,1and that the shear force in the fuselage immediately to the right of the frame is Sy,2; clearly, Sy,2=Sy,1−W.Sy,1andSy,2 generateshearﬂowdistributions q1andq2,respectivelyinthefuselageskin,eachgiven byEq.(22.1)inwhich Sx,1=Sx,2=0andIxy=0(Cyisanaxisofsymmetry).Theshear ﬂowqftransmittedtotheperipheryoftheframeisequaltothealgebraicsumof q1and q2, i.e. qf=q1−q2Ch24-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 39 644 Fuselage frames and wing ribs Fig. 24.8 Loads on a fuselage frame.

Since the wing bending moments are resisted entirely by the ﬂanges 1, 2 and 3, the shear ﬂows developed in the wing skin are constant between the ﬂanges.

Inthischapterweshallexaminesomerelativelysimpleexamplesoftheaboveeffects; more complex cases require analysis by computer-based techniques such as the ﬁniteelement method. 26.1 General aspects Structural constraint stresses in either closed or open beams result from a restrictiononthefreedomofanysectionofthebeamtoassumeitsnormaldisplacedshapeunderload. Such a restriction arises when one end of the beam is built-in although the sameeffectmaybeproducedpractically,inavarietyofways.Forexample,therootsectionofabeamsubjectedtotorsioniscompletelyrestrainedfromwarpingintothedisplacedshape indicated by Eq. (18.5) and a longitudinal stress system is induced which, in aspecial case discussed later, is proportional to the free warping of the beam. A slightly different situation arises when the beam supports shear loads. The stress systempredictedbyelementarybendingtheoryreliesonthebasicassumptionofplanesections remaining plane after bending. However, for a box beam comprising thinskins and booms, the shear strains in the skins are of sufﬁcient magnitude to causea measurable redistribution of direct load in the booms and hence previously planesections warp. We shall discuss the phenomenon of load redistribution resulting fromshear,knownas shearlag,indetaillaterinthechapter.Thepreventionofthiswarping by some form of axial constraint modiﬁes the stress system still further. The most comprehensive analysis yet published of multi-cell and single cell beams under arbitrary loading and support conditions is that by Argyris and Dunne. 1Their workconcentratesinthemainonbeamsofidealizedcross-sectionandwhilethetheorythey present is in advance of that required here, it is beneﬁcial to examine some ofthe results of their analysis. We shall limit the present discussion to closed beams ofidealized cross-section.Ch26-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 15: 10 680 Closed section beams The problem of axial constraint may be conveniently divided into two parts. In the ﬁrst, the shear stress distribution due to an arbitrary loading is calculated exclusively at the built-in end of the beam. In the second, the stress (and/or load) distributions arecalculated along the length of the beam for the separate loading cases of torsion andshear. Obviously the shear stress systems predicted by each portion of theory must becompatible at the built-in end. Argyris and Dunne showed that the calculation of the shear stress distribution at a built-inendisarelativelysimpleproblem,thesolutionbeingobtainedforanyloadingand beam cross-section by statics. More complex is the determination of the stressdistributionsatsectionsalongthebeam.Thesestresses,forthetorsioncase,areshownto be the sum of the stresses predicted by elementary theory and stresses caused bysystems of self-equilibrating end loads. For a beam supporting shear loads the totalstresses are again the sum of those corresponding to elementary bending theory andstresses due to systems of self-equilibrating end loads. For ann-boom, idealized beam,Argyris and Dunne found that there are n−3 self- equilibrating end load, or eigenload , systems required to nullify n−3 possible modes of warping displacement. These eigenloads are analogous to, say, the buckling loadscorrespondingtothedifferentbuckledshapesofanelasticstrut.Thefactthat,generally,thereareanumberofwarpingdisplacementspossibleinanidealizedbeaminvalidatesthe use of the shear centre or ﬂexural axis as a means of separating torsion and shearloads.For,associatedwitheachwarpingdisplacementisanaxisoftwistthatisdifferentfor each warping mode. In practice, a good approximation is obtained if the torsionloadsarereferredtotheaxisoftwistcorrespondingtothelowesteigenload.Transverseloadsthroughthisaxis,the zerowarpingaxis producenowarpingduetotwist,although axial constraint stresses due to shear will still be present. In the special case of a doubly symmetrical section the problem of separating the torsion and bending loads does not arise since it is obvious that the torsion loadsmay be referred to the axis of symmetry. Double symmetry has the further effectof dividing the eigenloads into four separate groups corresponding to ( n/4)−1 pure ﬂexural modes in each of the xzandyzplanes, (n/4) pure twisting modes about the centre of symmetry and ( n/4)−1 pure warping modes which involve neither ﬂexure nortwisting.Adoublysymmetricalsixboombeamsupportingasingleshearloadhastherefore just one eigenload system if the centre boom in the top and bottom panelsis regarded as being divided equally on either side of the axis of symmetry therebyconverting it, in effect, into an eight boom beam.

If, in addition, the beam isdoublysymmetricalthenitsaxisoftwistwillpassthroughthecentreofsymmetry.Wenote that only in cases of doubly symmetrical beams do the zero warping and ﬂexuralaxes coincide. A further special case arises when the beam possesses the properties of a Neuber beam(Section18.1.2)whichdoesnotwarpundertorsion.Thestressesinthiscasearethe elementary torsion theory stresses since no constraint effects are present. Whenbending loads predominate, however, it is generally impossible to design an efﬁcientstructure which does not warp.Ch26-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 15: 10 26.2 Shear stress distribution 681 In this chapter the calculation of spanwise stress distributions in closed section beams is limited to simple cases of beams having doubly symmetrical cross-sections. It should be noted that simpliﬁcations of this type can be misleading in that some ofthe essential characteristics of beam analysis, for example the existence of the n−3 self-equilibrating end load systems, vanish. 26.2 Shear stress distribution at a built-in end of a closed section beam This special case of structural constraint is of interest due to the fact that the shear stressdistributionatthebuilt-inendofaclosedsectionbeamisstaticallydeterminate.Figure 26.1 represents the cross-section of a thin-walled closed section beam at itsbuilt-in end.

The analysis of a rectangular section beam built-in at one end and subjected to a pure torque at the other is simpliﬁed if the section is idealized into one comprisingfour corner booms which are assumed to carry all the direct stresses together withshear–stress-only carrying walls. The assumption on which the idealization is basedis that the direct stress distribution at any cross-section is directly proportional to thewarpingwhichhasbeensuppressed.Therefore,thedistributionofdirectstressislineararound any cross-section and has values equal in magnitude but opposite in sign atoppositecornersofawall.Thisappliesatallcross-sectionssincethefreewarpingwillbesuppressedtosomeextentalongthecompletelengthofthebeam.InFig.26.5(b)allthe booms will have the same cross-sectional area from anti-symmetry and, from Eq.(20.1) or (20.2) B=at a 6(2−1)+btb 6(2−1)=1 6(ata+btb) To the boom area Bwill be added existing concentrations of area such as connecting anglesectionsatthecorners.Thecontributionsofstringersmaybeincludedbyallowingfor their direct stress carrying capacity by increasing the actual wall thickness by anamount equal to the total stringer area on one wall before idealizing the section.

The ﬁrst terms, T/2abtaandT/2abtb, are the shear stresses pre- dicted by elementary theory (see Section 18.1), while the hyperbolic second termsCh26-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 15: 10 692 Closed section beams Fig. 26.9 Shear stress distributions along the beam of Fig. 11.5. represent the effects of the warping restraint. Clearly, for an anticlockwise torque and bta>atb, the effect of this constraint is to increase the shear stress in the covers over that predicted by elementary theory and decrease the shear stress in the webs. It mayalso be noted that for bt ato be greater than atbfor the beam of Fig. 26.6, in which a>b, thentamust be appreciably greater than tbso thatT/2abta<T/2abtb. Also at the built-in end ( z=0), Eqs (26.21) and (26.22) reduce to τa=T/a(bta+atb) and τb=T/b(bta+atb) so that even though τbis reduced by the axial constraint and τa increased, τbis still greater than τa. It should also be noted that these values of τaand τbat the built-in end may be obtained using the method of Section 26.2 and that these are the values of shear stress irrespective of whether the section has been idealized ornot.Inotherwords,thepresenceofintermediatestringersand/ordirectstresscarryingwalls does not affect the shear ﬂows at the built-in end since the direct stress gradientat this section is zero (see Section 26.2 and Eq. (17.2)) except in the corner booms.Finally, when both zandLbecome large, i.e. at the free end of a long, slender beam τ a→T 2abtaandτb→T 2abtb The above situation is shown in Fig. 26.9.

We have seen in Chapter 18 that torsion induces shear stresses in the walls of beams and these cause shear strains which produce warping of the cross-section. When this warping is restrained, direct stresses are set up whichmodify the shear stresses. In a similar manner the shear strains in the thin walls ofbeamssubjectedtoshearloadscausecross-sectionstodistortorwarpsothatthebasicassumptionofelementarybendingtheoryofplanesectionsremainingplaneisnolongervalid.Thedirectandshearstressdistributionspredictedbyelementarytheorythereforebecomesigniﬁcantlyinaccurate.Furthermodiﬁcationsarisewhenanyformofstructuralconstraint prevents the free displacement of the cross-sections of a beam. Generally,shear lag becomes a problem in wide, relatively shallow, thin-walled beams such aswings in which the shear distortion of the thin upper and lower surface skins causesredistribution of stress in the stringers and spar caps while the thicker and shallowerspar webs experience little effect. ConsidertheboxbeamshowninFig.26.10.Elementarybendingtheorypredictsthat thedirectstressatanysectionAAwouldbeuniformacrossthewidthofthecoverssothatthe stringers and web ﬂanges would all be subjected to the same stress. However, theshearstrainsatthesectioncausethedistortionshownsothattheintermediatestringerscarrylowerstressesthanthewebﬂanges.Sincetheresultantofthedirectstressesmust Fig. 26.10 Shear distortion in the covers of a box beam.Ch26-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 15: 10 26.4 Shear lag 695 be equivalent to the applied bending moment this means that the direct stresses in the web ﬂanges must be greater than those predicted by elementary bending theory. Ourinvestigation of the shear lag problem will be restricted to idealized six- and eight-boom doubly symmetrical rectangular section beams subjected to shear loads actingin the plane of symmetry and in which the axis of twist, the ﬂexural axis and the zerowarpingaxiscoincide;theshearloadsthereforeproducenotwistandhencenowarpingdue to twist. In the analysis we shall assume that the cross-sections of beams remainundistorted in their own plane. Figure 26.11 shows an idealized six-boom beam built-in at one end and carrying a shearloadattheother;thecornerboomshaveacross-sectionalarea Bwhilethecentral booms have a cross-sectional area A. At any section the vertical shear load is shared equally by the two webs. Also, since the beam has been idealized, the shear ﬂow atany section will be constant between the booms so that, for a web, the situation isthat shown in the free body diagram of Fig. 26.12, in addition, the corner booms aresubjected to equal and opposite loads P B.

It is advantageous to adopt a methodical approach in the analysis. Thus, use may be made of the symmetry of the cover so that only one edge boom, one panel andthe central boom need to be considered as long as the symmetry is allowed for in theassumed directions of the panel shear ﬂows q, as shown in Fig. 26.13.

It is essential in the designof structural components that the aerodynamic load distribution on the component isknown.Wingdistortion,forexample,mayproducesigniﬁcantchangesinliftdistribu-tion from that calculated on the assumption of a rigid wing, especially in instances ofhigh wing loadings such as those experienced in manoeuvres and gusts. To estimateactual lift distributions the aerodynamicist requires to know the incidence of the wingat all stations along its span. Obviously this is affected by any twisting of the wingwhich may be present. Let us consider the case of a simple straight wing with the centre of twist behind the aerodynamic centre (see Fig. 28.1).The moment of the lift vector about the centreof twist causes an increase in wing incidence which produces a further increase inlift, leading to another increase in incidence and so on. At speeds below a criticalvalue, called the divergence speed , the increments in lift converge to a condition of stableequilibriuminwhichthetorsionalmomentoftheaerodynamicforcesaboutthecentre of twist is balanced by the torsional rigidity of the wing. The calculation oflift distribution then proceeds from a knowledge of the distribution of twist along thewing. For a straight wing the redistribution of lift usually causes an outward spanwisemovement of the centre of pressure, resulting in greater bending moments at the wingroot. In the case of a swept wing a reduction in streamwise incidence of the outboardsectionsduetobendingdeﬂectionscausesamovementofthecentreofpressuretowardsthe wing root. All aerodynamic surfaces of the aircraft suffer similar load redistribution due to distortion. 28.2.1 Wing torsional divergence (two-dimensional case) The most common divergence problem is the torsional divergence of a wing. It is useful, initially, to consider the case of a wing of area Swithout ailerons and in a Fig. 28.1 Increase of wing incidence due to wing twist.Ch28-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 42 28.2 Load distribution and divergence 747 two-dimensionalﬂow,asshowninFig.28.2.Thetorsionalstiffnessofthewing,which we shall represent by a spring of stiffness, K, resists the moment of the lift vector, L, and the wing pitching moment, M0, acting at the aerodynamic centre of the wing section.Formomentequilibriumofthewingsectionabouttheaerodynamiccentrewehave M 0+Lec=Kθ (28.1) whereecis the distance of the aerodynamic centre forward of the ﬂexural centre expressed in terms of the wing chord, c, andθis the elastic twist of the wing.

This is no longer the case for a swept wing where the spanwise axes are inclined to the aircraft’s plane of symmetry. Let us consider theswept wing of Fig. 28.4. The wing lift distribution causes the wing to bend in anupward direction. Points A and B on a line perpendicular to the reference axis willdeﬂect by approximately the same amount, but this will be greater than the deﬂectionof A /primewhich means that bending reduces the streamwise incidence of the wing.

Diederich and Budiansky in 1948 showedthat wings with moderate or large sweepback cannot diverge. The opposite of courseis true for swept-forward wings where bending deﬂections have a destabilizing effectand divergence speeds are extremely low. The determination of lift distributions anddivergence speeds for swept-forward wings is presented in Ref. [3]. 28.3 Control effectiveness and reversal Theﬂexibilityofthemajoraerodynamicsurfaces(wings,verticalandhorizontaltails) adversely affects the effectiveness of the corresponding control surfaces (ailerons,rudder and elevators). For example, the downward deﬂection of an aileron causes anose-down twisting of the wing which consequently reduces the aileron incidence. Thus,thewingtwisttendstoreducetheincreaseinliftproducedbytheailerondeﬂec- tion, and thereby the rolling moment to a value less than that for a rigid wing. Theaerodynamic twisting moment on the wing due to aileron deﬂection increases as thesquare of the speed but the elastic restoring moment is constant since it depends onthetorsionalstiffnessofthewingstructure.Therefore,aileronsbecomemarkedlylesseffective as the speed increases until, at a particular speed, the aileron reversal speed, ailerondeﬂectiondoesnotproduceanyrollingmomentatall.Athigherspeedsreversedaileron movements are necessary in that a positive increment of wing lift requires anupward aileron deﬂection and vice versa. Similar, less critical, problems arise in the loss of effectiveness and reversal of the rudder and elevator controls.

Although the analysis described above is based on a two-dimensional case, it is sometimes used in practice to give approximate answers for ﬁnite wings. The method is to apply the theory to a representative wing cross-section at an arbitrary spanwisestation and use the local wing section properties in the formulae.Ch28-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 42 754 Wing problems 28.3.2 Aileron effectiveness and reversal (ﬁnite wing) Weshallagainapplystriptheorytoinvestigatetheaeroelasticeffectsofailerondeﬂec- tion on a ﬁnite wing.

Another non-classical form of ﬂutter, aileron buzz, occurs at high subsonic speeds andisassociatedwiththeshockwaveonthewingforwardoftheaileron.Iftheaileronoscillates downwards the ﬂow over the upper surface of the wing accelerates, intensi-fying the shock and resulting in a reduction in pressure in the boundary layer behindtheshock.Theaileron,therefore,tendstobesuckedbacktoitsneutralposition.Whenthe aileron rises the shock intensity reduces and the pressure in the boundary layerincreases, tending to push the aileron back to its neutral position.

The vertical motion therefore induces a twisting motion by virtue of the inertia forces present, i.e. inertial coupling. Conversely, an angular acceleration ¨α about the ﬂexural axis causes a linear acceleration of gc¨αat the centre of gravity with a corresponding inertia force of mgc¨α. Thus, angular acceleration generates a force producing translation, again inertial coupling. Note that the inertia torque due to unitlinear acceleration (mgc ) is equal to the inertia force due to unit angular acceleration (mgc); the inertial coupling therefore possesses symmetry.

From the above it can be seen that ﬂutter will be prevented by uncoupling the two constituent motions. Thus, inertial coupling is prevented if the centre of gravity coin- cideswiththeﬂexuralaxis,whileaerodynamiccouplingiseliminatedwhenthecentreof independence coincides with the ﬂexural axis. This, in fact, would also eliminateelastic coupling since O in Fig. 28.9 would generally be the centre of independence.Unfortunately, in practical situations, the centre of independence is usually forwardof the ﬂexural axis, while the centre of gravity is behind it giving conditions whichpromote ﬂutter. 28.4.2 Determination of critical ﬂutter speed Consider a wing section of chord coscillating harmonically in an airﬂow of velocity Vand density ρand having instantaneous displacements, velocities and accelerations of, rotationally, α,˙α,¨α, and, translationally, y,˙y,¨y.The oscillation causes a reduction in lift from the steady state lift4so that, in effect, the lift due to the oscillation acts downwards.The downward lift corresponding to α,˙αand¨αis, respectively lαρcV2α=Lαα l˙αρc2V˙α=L˙α˙α l¨αρc3¨α=L¨α¨α in which lα,l˙α,l¨αare non-dimensional coefﬁcients analogous to the lift-curve slopes insteadymotion.Similarly,downwardforcesduetothetranslationofthewingsectionoccur and are l yρcV2y/c=Lyy l˙yρc2V˙y/c=L˙y˙y l¨yρc3¨y/c=L¨y¨yCh28-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 42 28.4 Introduction to ‘ﬂutter’ 761 Fig. 28.10 Flutter of a wing section. Thus, the total aerodynamic lift on the wing section due to the oscillating motion is given by L=Lyy+L˙y˙y+L¨y¨y+Lαα+L˙α˙α+L¨α¨α (28.36) We have previously seen that rotational and translational displacements produce momentsaboutanychosencentre.Thus,thetotalnose-upmomentonthewingsectionis M=Myy+M˙y˙y+M¨y¨y+Mαα+M˙α˙α+M¨α¨α (28.37) where Myy=lyρc2V2y/c M˙y˙y=l˙yρc3V˙y/c M¨y¨y=l¨yρc4¨y/c Mαα=mαρc2V2α/c M˙α˙α=m˙αρc3V˙α/c M¨α¨α=m¨αρc4¨α/c inwhichmα,etc.areanalogoustothesteadymotionlocalpitchingmomentcoefﬁcients.

Above this critical value the equations represent divergent oscillatory motion, while at lower speeds they represent dampedoscillatory motion.

(28.42) is most readily obtained by computer4for which several methods are available. One method represents the motion of the system at a generalspeedVby y=y 0e(δ+iω)tα=α(δ+iω)t 0 in which δ+iωis one of the complex roots of the determinant of Eq. (28.42). For any speed Vthe imaginary part ωgives the frequency of the oscillating system while δrepresents the exponential growth rate. At low speeds the oscillation decays ( δis negative) and at high speeds it diverges ( δis positive). Zero growth rate corresponds to the critical ﬂutter speed Vf, which may therefore be obtained by calculating δfor a range of speeds and determining the value of Vfforδ=0. 28.4.3 Prevention of ﬂutter We have previously seen that ﬂutter can be prevented by eliminating inertial, aero- dynamic and elastic coupling by arranging for the centre of gravity, the centre ofindependence and the ﬂexural axis of the wing section to coincide. The means bywhich this may be achieved are indicated in the coupling terms in Eqs (28.40) and(28.41). In Eq. (28.41) the inertial coupling term is mgc+M ¨yin which M¨yis usually very muchsmallerthan mgc.Thus,inertialcouplingmaybevirtuallyeliminatedbyadjustingCh28-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 42 28.4 Introduction to ‘ﬂutter’ 763 thepositionofthecentreofgravityofthewingsectionthrough massbalancing sothat it coincides with the ﬂexural axis, i.e. gc=0. The aerodynamic coupling term M˙y˙y vanishes,aswehaveseen,whenthecentreofindependencecoincideswiththeﬂexural axis. Further, the terms MyyandL˙α˙αare very small and may be neglected so that Eqs (28.40) and (28.41) now reduce to (m−L¨y)¨y−L˙y˙y+(k−Ly)y−Lαα=0 (28.43) and (IO−M¨α)¨α−M˙α˙α+(kθ−Mα)α=0 (28.44) Theremainingcouplingterm Lααcannotbeeliminatedsincetheverticalforcerequired to maintain ﬂight is produced by wing incidence. Equation (28.44) governs the torsional motion of the wing section and contains no coupling terms so that, since all the coefﬁcients are positive at speeds below the wingsection torsional divergence speed, any torsional oscillation produced, say, by a gustwill decay.Also, from Eq. (28.43), it would appear that a vertical oscillation could bemaintained by the incidence term L αα. However, rotational oscillations, as we have seen from Eq. (28.44), decay so that the lift force Lααis a decaying force and cannot maintain any vertical oscillation. Inpracticeitisnotalwayspossibletopreventﬂutterbyeliminatingcouplingterms. However, increasing structural stiffness, although carrying the penalty of increasedweight, can raise the value of V fabove the operating speed range.

In practice the structure of an aircraft can oscillate in many differentways.Forexample,awinghasfundamentalbendingandtorsionalmodesofoscillationon which secondary or overtone modes of oscillation are superimposed. Also it ispossible for fuselage bending oscillations to produce changes in wing camber therebyaffecting wing lift and for control surfaces oscillating about their hinges to produceaerodynamic forces on the main surfaces. The equations of motion for an actual aircraft are therefore complex with a number N, say, of different motions being represented (N can be as high as 12). There are, therefore, Nequationsofmotionwhichareaerodynamicallycoupled.Atagivenspeed, solutionofthese Nequationsyields Ndifferentvaluesof δ+iωcorrespondingtothe N modes of oscillation.Again, as in the simple two degrees of freedom case, the criticalﬂutter speed for each mode may be found by calculating δfor a range of speeds and determining the value of speed at which δ=0. A similar approach is used experimentally on actual aircraft. The aircraft is ﬂown at a given steady speed and caused to oscillate either by exploding a small detonatoron the wing or control surface or by a sudden control jerk. The resulting oscillationsare recorded and analysed to determine the decay rate. The procedure is repeatedCh28-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 42 764 Wing problems Fig. 28.11 Experimental determination of ﬂutter speed. at increasing speeds with smaller increments being used at higher speeds. The mea- sured decay rates are plotted against speed, producing a curve such as that shown inFig. 28.11. This curve is then extrapolated to the zero decay point which correspondstoV f. Clearly this approach requires as accurate as possible a preliminary estimation of ﬂutter speed since induced oscillations above the ﬂutter speed diverge leading topossibly catastrophic results. Other experimental work involves wind tunnel tests on ﬂutter models, the results being used to check theoretical calculations. 3 28.4.5 Control surface ﬂutter If a control surface oscillates about its hinge, oscillating forces are induced on themain surface. For example, if a wing oscillates in bending at the same time as theaileronoscillatesaboutitshinge,ﬂuttercanoccurprovidedthereisaphasedifferencebetween the two motions. In similar ways elevator and rudder ﬂutter can occur asthe fuselage oscillates in bending. Other forms of control surface ﬂutter involve morethantwodifferenttypesofmotion.Includedinthiscategoryarewingbending/aileronrotation/tab rotation and elevator rotation/fuselage bending/rigid body pitching andtranslation of the complete aircraft. It can be shown 4that control surface ﬂutter can be prevented by eliminating the inertial coupling between the control rotation and the motion of the main surface. This may be achieved by mass balancing the control surface whereby weights are attached to the control surface forward of the hinge line. Allnewlydesignedaircraftaresubjectedearlyinthelifeofaprototypetoa ground resonancetest todetermineactualnormalmodesandfrequencies.Theprimaryobjec- tives of such tests are to check the accuracy of the calculated normal modes on whichthe ﬂutter predictions are based and to show up any unanticipated peculiarities in thevibrational behaviour of the aircraft. Usually the aircraft rests on some low frequencysupport system or even on its deﬂated tyres. Electrodynamic exciters are mounted inpairs on the wings and tail with accelerometers as the measuring devices. The testCh28-H6739.tex 23/1/2007 12: 42 Problems 765 procedure is generally ﬁrst to discover the resonant frequencies by recording ampli- tude and phase of a selected number of accelerometers over a given frequency range.Having obtained the resonant frequencies the aircraft is then excited at each of thesefrequencies in turn and all accelerometer records taken simultaneously.

A.6 Fuselage design calculations Two approaches to the actual design are possible. Elastic design usesallowable or workingstresses which are obtained from, say, the 0.1% proof stress by incorporating a factor of safety, usually 1.5; these stresses are then combined with the actual loads to produce skin and stringer sizes.Alternatively, ultimate load design is based on the actualloadsmultipliedbyanultimateloadfactor(seeSection13.1)whichthenproducesfailureloads,thestressesinvolvedarethereforetheultimatestresses.Forlinearsystemsthe methods produce identical results so that, in this case, since the 0.1% proof stressis given, elastic design will be used.The working, or allowable, stresses are then Direct =186/1.5=124N/mm 2 Shear =117/1.5=78N/mm2 TheproposedfuselagesectioniscircularaspreviouslyshowninFig.A.5.Thedesign processisrequiredtoproducesuitablestringersectionsandaskinthickness.Supposethateachstringer(orboom)hasacross-sectionalarea Bmm 2andthattheskinthickness istmm.The idealized fuselage section (see Section 20.2) is shown in FigA.8.

Hence tan2θ=2×45 80−0=1.125 which gives θ=24◦11/primeandθ=114◦11/prime It is clear from the derivation of Eqs (1.11) and (1.12) that the ﬁrst value of θ corresponds to σIwhile the second value corresponds to σII. Finally, the maximum shear stress is obtained from either of Eqs (1.14) or (1.15). Hence from Eq.
