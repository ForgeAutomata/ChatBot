Fun damentals of AerodynamicsJohn Anderson SIXTH EDITIONFundamentals of Aerodynamics Sixth Edition John D. Anderson, Jr.McGRAW-HILL SERIES IN AERONAUTICAL AND AEROSPACE ENGINEERING The Wright brothers invented the ﬁrst practical airplane in the ﬁrst decade of the twentieth century. Along with this came the rise of aeronauticalengineering as an exciting, new, distinct discipline. College courses in aeronautical engineering were offered as early as 1914 at the University ofMichigan and at MIT. Michigan was the ﬁrst university to establish an aero-nautics department with a four-year degree-granting program in 1916; by 1926 ithad graduated over one hundred students. The need for substantive textbooks invarious areas of aeronautical engineering became critical. Rising to this demand,McGraw-Hill became one of the ﬁrst publishers of aeronautical engineering text-books, starting with Airplane Design and Construction by Ottorino Pomilio in 1919, and the classic and deﬁnitive text Airplane Design: Aerodynamics by the iconic Edward P. Warner in 1927. Warner’s book was a watershed in aeronauticalengineering textbooks. Since then, McGraw-Hill has become the time-honored publisher of books in aeronautical engineering. With the advent of high-speed ﬂight after World War IIand the space program in 1957, aeronautical and aerospace engineering grewto new heights. There was, however, a hiatus that occurred in the 1970s whenaerospace engineering went through a transition, and virtually no new books inthe ﬁeld were published for almost a decade by anybody. McGraw-Hill brokethis hiatus with the foresight of its Chief Engineering Editor, B.J. Clark, whowas instrumental in the publication of Introduction to Flight by John Anderson. First published in 1978, Introduction to Flight is now in its 8th edition. Clark’s bold decision was followed by McGraw-Hill riding the crest of a new wave ofstudents and activity in aerospace engineering, and it opened the ﬂood-gates fornew textbooks in the ﬁeld. In 1988, McGraw-Hill initiated its formal series in Aeronautical and Aerospace Engineering, gathering together under one roof all its existing textsin the ﬁeld, and soliciting new manuscripts. This author is proud to have beenmade the consulting editor for this series, and to have contributed some of thetitles. Starting with eight books in 1988, the series now embraces 24 books cov-ering a broad range of discipline in the ﬁeld. With this, McGraw-Hill continuesits tradition, started in 1919, as the premier publisher of important textbooks inaeronautical and aerospace engineering. John D.

It is consciously written ina clear, informal, and direct style to talkto the reader and gain his or her immediate interest in the challenging and yet beautiful discipline of aerodynamics.The explanation of each topic is carefully constructed to make sense to the reader.Moreover, the structure of each chapter is highly organized in order to keepthe reader aware of where we are, where we were, and where we are going.Too frequently the student of aerodynamics loses sight of what is trying to beaccomplished; to avoid this, I attempt to keep the reader informed of my intentat all times. For example, preview boxes are introduced at the beginning of eachchapter. These short sections, literally set in boxes, inform the reader in plainlanguage what to expect from each chapter and why the material is important andexciting. They are primarily motivational; they help to encourage the reader toactually enjoy reading the chapter, therefore enhancing the educational process.In addition, each chapter contains a road map—a block diagram designed tokeep the reader well aware of the proper ﬂow of ideas and concepts. The use ofpreview boxes and chapter road maps are unique features of this book. Also, tohelp organize the reader’s thoughts, there are special summary sections at the endof most chapters. The material in this book is at the level of college juniors and seniors in aerospace or mechanical engineering. It assumes no prior knowledge of ﬂuiddynamics in general, or aerodynamics in particular. It does assume a familiaritywith differential and integral calculus, as well as the usual physics backgroundcommon to most students of science and engineering. Also, the language ofvector analysis is used liberally; a compact review of the necessary elementsof vector algebra and vector calculus is given in Chapter 2 in such a fashionthat it can either educate or refresh the reader, whatever may be the case foreach individual. This book is designed for a one-year course in aerodynamics. Chapters 1 to 6 constitute a solid semester emphasizing inviscid, incompressible ﬂow. Chapters 7to 14 occupy a second semester dealing with inviscid, compressible ﬂow. Finally,Chapters 15 to 20 introduce some basic elements of viscous ﬂow, mainly to serveas a contrast to and comparison with the inviscid ﬂows treated throughout the bulkof the text. Speciﬁc sections on viscous ﬂow, however, have been added muchearlier in the book in order to give the reader some idea of how the inviscid resultsare tempered by the inﬂuence of friction. This is done by adding self-containedviscous ﬂow sections at the end of various chapters, written and placed in such away that they do not interfere with the ﬂow of the inviscid ﬂow discussion, butare there to complement the discussion. For example, at the end of Chapter 4 on xvxvi Preface to the Sixth Edition incompressible inviscid ﬂow over airfoils, there is a viscous ﬂow section that deals with the prediction of skin friction drag on such airfoils. A similar viscous ﬂowsection at the end of Chapter 12 deals with friction drag on high-speed airfoils.At the end of the chapters on shock waves and nozzle ﬂows, there are viscousﬂow sections on shock wave/boundary-layer interactions. And so forth. Other features of this book are: 1.An introduction to computational ﬂuid dynamics as an integral part of thestudy of aerodynamics. Computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) has recentlybecome a third dimension in aerodynamics, complementing the previouslyexisting dimension of pure experiment and pure theory. It is absolutelynecessary that the modern student of aerodynamics be introduced to someof the basic ideas of CFD—he or she will most certainly come face to facewith either its “machinery” or its results after entering the professionalranks of practicing aerodynamicists. Hence, such subjects as the source andvortex panel techniques, the method of characteristics, and explicitﬁnite-difference solutions are introduced and discussed as they naturallyarise during the course of our discussion. In particular, Chapter 13 isdevoted exclusively to numerical techniques, couched at a level suitable toan introductory aerodynamics text. 2.A chapter is devoted entirely to hypersonic ﬂow. Although hypersonics is atone extreme end of the ﬂight spectrum, it has current important applicationsto the design of hypervelocity missiles, planetary entry vehicles, andmodern hypersonic atmospheric cruise vehicles. Therefore, hypersonic ﬂowdeserves some attention in any modern presentation of aerodynamics. Thisis the purpose of Chapter 14. 3.Historical notes are placed at the end of many of the chapters. This followsin the tradition of some of my previous textbooks, Introduction to Flight: Its Engineering and History, 8th Edition (McGraw-Hill, 2016) and Modern Compressible Flow: With Historical Perspecive, 3rd Edition (McGraw-Hill,2003). Although aerodynamics is a rapidly evolving subject, its foundationsare deeply rooted in the history of science and technology. It is importantfor the modern student of aerodynamics to have an appreciation for thehistorical origin of the tools of the trade. Therefore, this book addressessuch questions as who Bernoulli, Euler, d’Alembert, Kutta, Joukowski, andPrandtl were; how the circulation theory of lift developed; and whatexcitement surrounded the early development of high-speed aerodynamics.I wish to thank various members of the staff of the National Air and SpaceMuseum of the Smithsonian Institution for opening their extensive ﬁles forsome of the historical research behind these history sections. Also, aconstant biographical reference was the Dictionary of Scientiﬁc Biography, edited by C. C. Gillespie, Charles Schribner’s Sons, New York, 1980. Thisis a 16-volume set of books that is a valuable source of biographicinformation on the leading scientists in history.Preface to the Sixth Edition xvii 4.Design boxes are scattered throughout the book. These design boxes are special sections for the purpose of discussing design aspects associated withthe fundamental material covered throughout the book. These sections areliterally placed in boxes to set them apart from the mainline text. Modernengineering education is placing more emphasis on design, and the designboxes in this book are in this spirit. They are a means of making thefundamental material more relevant and making the whole process oflearning aerodynamics more fun. Due to the extremely favorable comments from readers and users of the ﬁrst ﬁve editions, virtually all the content of the earlier editions has been carried over intact to the present sixth edition. In this edition, however, a completely new edu-cational tool has been introduced in some of the chapters in order to enhance andexpand the reader’s learning process. Throughout the previous editions, numer-ous worked examples have been included at the end of many of the sections toillustrate and reinforce the ideas and methods discussed in that particular section. These are still included in the present sixth edition. However, added at the end ofa number of the chapters in this sixth edition, a major challenge is given to thereader that integrates and uses thoughts and equations drawn from the chapter as a whole. These new sections are called END OF CHAPTER INTEGRATEDWORK CHALLENGES. They are listed next: Chapter 1: A forward-facing axial aerodynamic force on an airfoil sounds not possible, but it can actually happen. What are the conditions under which it can happen?Also, the history of when such a forward-facing force was ﬁrst observed isdiscussed. Chapter 2: Using the momentum equation, develop the relation between drag on an aerodynamic body and the loss of total pressure in the ﬂow ﬁeld. Chapter 3: Perform a conceptual design of a low-speed subsonic wind tunnel. Chapter 4: Find a way to account for the effects of wind tunnel walls on the measurements made on an aerodynamic body in a low-speed wind tunnel. Chapter 7: Obtain and discuss a relation between supersonic wave drag on a body and the entropy increase in the ﬂow. Chapter 9: Consider the sonic boom generated from a body in supersonic ﬂight. What is it? How is it created? How can its strength be reduced? Chapter 10: Perform a conceptual design of a supersonic wind tunnel. Chapter 11: At the end of World War II, in the face of the lack of reliable transonic wind tunnels and the extreme theoretical difﬁculty solving thenonlinear mathematical equations that govern transonic ﬂow, the NACAdeveloped an innovative experimental method for obtaining transonicaerodynamic data. Called the “wing-ﬂow technique,” it involved mountinga small airfoil wing model vertically on the surface of the wing of a P-51xviii Preface to the Sixth Edition ﬁghter airplane at a location inside the bubble of locally supersonic ﬂow formed on the P-51 wing when the airplane exceeded its critical Machnumber. Design this apparatus, taking into account the size of the testmodel, the ﬂow conditions over the test model, the optimum locations on theP-51 wing, etc. Also, the history of the wing-ﬂow techniques will be given. The answers to these Integrated Work Challenges are given right there in the text so that the reader can gain instant gratiﬁcation after working them out, just like the other worked examples; the answers are just more complex with a morewidespread educational value. New homework problems have been added to McGraw-Hill’s online learning environment, Connect ®. These question banks will include all end-of-chapter problems from the textbook and additional problems unique to Connect. All the new additional material not withstanding, the main thrust of this book remains the presentation of the fundamentals of aerodynamics; the new materialis simply intended to enhance and support this thrust. I repeat that the book isorganized along classical lines, dealing with inviscid incompressible ﬂow, inviscidcompressible ﬂow, and viscous ﬂow in sequence. My experience in teaching thismaterial to undergraduates ﬁnds that it nicely divides into a two-semester coursewith Parts 1 and 2 in the ﬁrst semester and Parts 3 and 4 in the second semester.Also, I have taught the entire book in a fast-paced, ﬁrst-semester graduate courseintended to introduce the fundamentals of aerodynamics to new graduate studentswho have not had this material as part of their undergraduate education. The bookworks well in such a mode. I would like to thank the McGraw-Hill editorial and production staff for their excellent help in producing this book, especially Jolynn Kilburg and ThomasScaife, PhD, in Dubuque. Our photo researcher, David Tietz, was invaluablein searching out new and replacement photographs for the new edition to sat-isfy new McGraw-Hill guidelines; I don’t know what I would have done with-out him. Also, special thanks go to my long-time friend and associate, SueCunningham, whose expertise as a scientiﬁc typist is beyond comparison andwho has typed all my book manuscripts for me, including this one, with great careand precision. I want to thank my students over the years for many stimulating discussions on the subject of aerodynamics, discussions that have inﬂuenced the development ofthis book. Special thanks go to three institutions: (1) The University of Marylandfor providing a challenging intellectual atmosphere in which I have basked forthe past 42 years; (2) The National Air and Space Museum of the SmithsonianInstitution for opening the world of the history of the technology of ﬂight for me;and (3) the Anderson household—Sarah-Allen, Katherine, and Elizabeth—whohave been patient and understanding over the years while their husband and fatherwas in his ivory tower. Also, I pay respect to the new generation, which includesmy two beautiful granddaughters, Keegan and Tierney Glabus, who represent thefuture. To them, I dedicate this book.Preface to the Sixth Edition xix As a ﬁnal comment, aerodynamics is a subject of intellectual beauty, com- posed and drawn by many great minds over the centuries. Fundamentals of Aero- dynamics is intended to portray and convey this beauty. Do you feel challenged and interested by these thoughts? If so, then read on, and enjoy! John D. Anderson, Jr.PART1 Fundamental Principles In Part 1, we cover some of the basic principles that apply to aerodynamics in general. These are the pillars on which all of aerodynamics is based. 1CHAPTER 1 Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts The term “aerodynamics” is generally used for problems arising from ﬂight and other topics involving the ﬂow of air. Ludwig Prandtl, 1949 Aerodynamics: The dynamics of gases, especially atmospheric interactions withmoving objects. The American HeritageDictionary of the EnglishLanguage, 1969 PREVIEW BOX Why learn about aerodynamics? For an answer, just take a look at the following ﬁve photographs showinga progression of airplanes over the past 70 years. TheDouglas DC-3 (Figure 1.1), one of the most famousaircraft of all time, is a low-speed subsonic trans-port designed during the 1930s. Without a knowl-edge of low-speed aerodynamics, this aircraft wouldhave never existed. The Boeing 707 (Figure 1.2)opened high-speed subsonic ﬂight to millions of pas-sengers beginning in the late 1950s. Without a knowl-edge of high-speed subsonic aerodynamics, most ofus would still be relegated to ground transportation. Figure 1.1 Douglas DC-3 (NASA). 34 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 1.2 Boeing 707 (© Everett Collection Historical/Alamy). Figure 1.3 Bell X-1 (Library of Congress [LC-USZ6-1658]). Figure 1.4 Lockheed F-104 (Library of Congress [LC-USZ62-94416]). The Bell X-1 (Figure 1.3) became the ﬁrst piloted air- plane to ﬂy faster than sound, a feat accomplishedwith Captain Chuck Yeager at the controls on Oc-tober 14, 1947. Without a knowledge of transonicaerodynamics (near, at, and just above the speed ofsound), neither the X-1, nor any other airplane, wouldhave ever broken the sound barrier. The LockheedF-104 (Figure 1.4) was the ﬁrst supersonic airplane Figure 1.5 Lockheed-Martin F-22 (U.S. Air Force Photo/Staff Sgt. Vernon Young Jr.). Figure 1.6 Blended wing body (NASA). point-designed to ﬂy at twice the speed of sound,accomplished in the 1950s. The Lockheed-MartinF-22 (Figure 1.5) is a modern ﬁghter aircraft designedfor sustained supersonic ﬂight. Without a knowledgeof supersonic aerodynamics, these supersonic air-planes would not exist. Finally, an example of aninnovative new vehicle concept for high-speed sub-sonic ﬂight is the blended wing body shown in Figure1.6. At the time of writing, the blended-wing-bodypromises to carry from 400 to 800 passengers overlong distances with almost 30 percent less fuel perseat-mile than a conventional jet transport. This wouldbe a “renaissance” in long-haul transport. The salientdesign aspects of this exciting new concept are dis-cussed in Section 11.10. The airplanes in Figures 1.1–1.6 are six good reasons to learn about aerodynamics.The major purpose of this book is to help you do this.As you continue to read this and subsequent chapters,you will progressively learn about low-speed aerody-namics, high-speed subsonic aerodynamics, transonicaerodynamics, supersonic aerodynamics, and more.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 5 Airplanes are by no means the only application of aerodynamics. The air ﬂow over an automobile, the gas ﬂow through the internal combustion enginepowering an automobile, weather and storm predic-tion, the ﬂow through a windmill, the production ofthrust by gas turbine jet engines and rocket engines,and the movement of air through building heater andair-conditioning systems are just a few other exam-ples of the application of aerodynamics. The materialin this book is powerful stuff—important stuff. Havefun reading and learning about aerodynamics. To learn a new subject, you simply have to start at the beginning. This chapter is the beginning of ourstudy of aerodynamics; it weaves together a seriesof introductory thoughts, deﬁnitions, and conceptsessential to our discussions in subsequent chapters.For example, how does nature reach out and grabhold of an airplane in ﬂight—or any other objectemmersed in a ﬂowing ﬂuid—and exert an aerody-namic force on the object? We will ﬁnd out here. Theresultant aerodynamic force is frequently resolvedinto two components deﬁned as lift and drag; butrather than dealing with the lift and drag forces them-selves, aerodynamicists deal instead with lift and dragcoefﬁcients. What is so magic about lift and drag coefﬁcients? We will see. What is a Reynolds number?Mach number? Inviscid ﬂow? Viscous ﬂow? Theserather mysterious sounding terms will be demystiﬁedin the present chapter. They and others constitute thelanguage of aerodynamics, and as we all know, todo anything useful you have to know the language.Visualize this chapter as a beginning language lesson,necessary to go on to the exciting aerodynamic appli-cations in later chapters. There is a certain enjoymentand satisfaction in learning a new language. Take thischapter in that spirit, and move on. 1.1 IMPORTANCE OF AERODYNAMICS: HISTORICAL EXAMPLES On August 8, 1588, the waters of the English Channel churned with the gyrations of hundreds of warships. The great Spanish Armada had arrived to carry out aninvasion of Elizabethan England and was met head-on by the English ﬂeet underthe command of Sir Francis Drake. The Spanish ships were large and heavy;they were packed with soldiers and carried formidable cannons that ﬁred 50 lbround shot that could devastate any ship of that era. In contrast, the Englishships were smaller and lighter; they carried no soldiers and were armed withlighter, shorter-range cannons. The balance of power in Europe hinged on theoutcome of this naval encounter. King Philip II of Catholic Spain was attemptingto squash Protestant England’s rising inﬂuence in the political and religious affairsof Europe; in turn, Queen Elizabeth I was attempting to defend the very existenceof England as a sovereign state. In fact, on that crucial day in 1588, when theEnglish ﬂoated six ﬁre ships into the Spanish formation and then drove headlonginto the ensuing confusion, the future history of Europe was in the balance.In the ﬁnal outcome, the heavier, sluggish, Spanish ships were no match for thefaster, more maneuverable, English craft, and by that evening the Spanish Armadalay in disarray, no longer a threat to England. This naval battle is of particularimportance because it was the ﬁrst in history to be fought by ships on both sidespowered completely by sail (in contrast to earlier combinations of oars and sail),and it taught the world that political power was going to be synonymous withnaval power. In turn, naval power was going to depend greatly on the speed and6 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 1.7 Isaac Newton’s model of ﬂuid ﬂow in the year 1687. This model was widely adopted in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries but was later found to be conceptually inaccurate for most ﬂuid ﬂows. maneuverability of ships. To increase the speed of a ship, it is important to reduce the resistance created by the water ﬂow around the ship’s hull. Suddenly, thedrag on ship hulls became an engineering problem of great interest, thus givingimpetus to the study of ﬂuid mechanics. This impetus hit its stride almost a century later, when, in 1687, Isaac Newton (1642–1727) published his famous Principia, in which the entire second book was devoted to ﬂuid mechanics. Newton encountered the same difﬁculty as othersbefore him, namely, that the analysis of ﬂuid ﬂow is conceptually more difﬁcultthan the dynamics of solid bodies. A solid body is usually geometrically welldeﬁned, and its motion is therefore relatively easy to describe. On the otherhand, a ﬂuid is a “squishy” substance, and in Newton’s time it was difﬁcult todecide even how to qualitatively model its motion, let alone obtain quantitativerelationships. Newton considered a ﬂuid ﬂow as a uniform, rectilinear streamof particles, much like a cloud of pellets from a shotgun blast. As sketched inFigure 1.7, Newton assumed that upon striking a surface inclined at an angle θ to the stream, the particles would transfer their normal momentum to the surfacebut their tangential momentum would be preserved. Hence, after collision withthe surface, the particles would then move along the surface. This led to anexpression for the hydrodynamic force on the surface which varies as sin 2θ. This is Newton’s famous sine-squared law (described in detail in Chapter 14). Althoughits accuracy left much to be desired, its simplicity led to wide application in navalarchitecture. Later, in 1777, a series of experiments was carried out by JeanLeRond d’Alembert (1717–1783), under the support of the French government,in order to measure the resistance of ships in canals. The results showed that “therule that for oblique planes resistance varies with the sine square of the angle ofincidence holds good only for angles between 50 and 90 ◦and must be abandoned for lesser angles.” Also, in 1781, Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) pointed out thephysical inconsistency of Newton’s model (Figure 1.7) consisting of a rectilinearstream of particles impacting without warning on a surface. In contrast to thisCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 7 model, Euler noted that the ﬂuid moving toward a body “before reaching the latter, bends its direction and its velocity so that when it reaches the body it ﬂows past it along the surface, and exercises no other force on the body except the pressurecorresponding to the single points of contact.” Euler went on to present a formulafor resistance that attempted to take into account the shear stress distributionalong the surface, as well as the pressure distribution. This expression becameproportional to sin 2θfor large incidence angles, whereas it was proportional to sinθat small incidence angles. Euler noted that such a variation was in reasonable agreement with the ship-hull experiments carried out by d’Alembert. This early work in ﬂuid dynamics has now been superseded by modern con- cepts and techniques. (However, amazingly enough, Newton’s sine-squared lawhas found new application in very high-speed aerodynamics, to be discussed inChapter 14.) The major point here is that the rapid rise in the importance ofnaval architecture after the sixteenth century made ﬂuid dynamics an importantscience, occupying the minds of Newton, d’Alembert, and Euler, among manyothers. Today, the modern ideas of ﬂuid dynamics, presented in this book, are stilldriven in part by the importance of reducing hull drag on ships. Consider a second historical example. The scene shifts to Kill Devil Hills, 4 mi south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. It is summer of 1901, and Wilburand Orville Wright are struggling with their second major glider design, the ﬁrstbeing a stunning failure the previous year. The airfoil shape and wing design oftheir glider are based on aerodynamic data published in the 1890s by the greatGerman aviation pioneer Otto Lilienthal (1848–1896) and by Samuel PierpontLangley (1934–1906), secretary of the Smithsonian Institution—the most presti-gious scientiﬁc position in the United States at that time. Because their ﬁrst gliderin 1900 produced no meaningful lift, the Wright brothers have increased the wingarea from 165 to 290 ft 2and have increased the wing camber (a measure of the airfoil curvature—the larger the camber, the more “arched” is the thin airfoilshape) by almost a factor of 2. But something is still wrong. In Wilbur’s words,the glider’s “lifting capacity seemed scarcely one-third of the calculated amount.”Frustration sets in. The glider is not performing even close to their expectations,although it is designed on the basis of the best available aerodynamic data. OnAugust 20, the Wright brothers despairingly pack themselves aboard a train goingback to Dayton, Ohio. On the ride back, Wilbur mutters that “nobody will ﬂy fora thousand years.” However, one of the hallmarks of the Wrights is perseverance,and within weeks of returning to Dayton, they decide on a complete departurefrom their previous approach. Wilbur later wrote that “having set out with abso-lute faith in the existing scientiﬁc data, we were driven to doubt one thing afteranother, until ﬁnally after two years of experiment, we cast it all aside, and de-cided to rely entirely upon our own investigations.” Since their 1901 glider wasof poor aerodynamic design, the Wrights set about determining what constitutesgood aerodynamic design. In the fall of 1901, they design and build a 6 ft long,16 in square wind tunnel powered by a two-bladed fan connected to a gasolineengine. A replica of the Wrights’ tunnel is shown in Figure 1.8 a. In their wind tunnel they test over 200 different wing and airfoil shapes, including ﬂat plates,8 PART 1Fundamental Principles (a) (b) Figure 1.8 (a) Replica of the wind tunnel designed, built, and used by the Wright brothers in Dayton, Ohio, during 1901–1902. (b) Wing models tested by the Wright brothersin their wind tunnel during 1901–1902. ((a) NASA;(b) Courtesy of John Anderson). curved plates, rounded leading edges, rectangular and curved planforms, and var- ious monoplane and multiplane conﬁgurations. A sample of their test models isshown in Figure 1.8b . The aerodynamic data are taken logically and carefully. Armed with their new aerodynamic information, the Wrights design a new gliderin the spring of 1902. The airfoil is much more efﬁcient; the camber is reducedconsiderably, and the location of the maximum rise of the airfoil is moved closerto the front of the wing. The most obvious change, however, is that the ratio ofthe length of the wing (wingspan) to the distance from the front to the rear of theairfoil (chord length) is increased from 3 to 6. The success of this glider duringCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 9 the summer and fall of 1902 is astounding; Orville and Wilbur accumulate over a thousand ﬂights during this period. In contrast to the previous year, the Wrightsreturn to Dayton ﬂushed with success and devote all their subsequent efforts topowered ﬂight. The rest is history. The major point here is that good aerodynamics was vital to the ultimate success of the Wright brothers and, of course, to all subsequent successful airplanedesigns up to the present day. The importance of aerodynamics to successfulmanned ﬂight goes without saying, and a major thrust of this book is to presentthe aerodynamic fundamentals that govern such ﬂight. Consider a third historical example of the importance of aerodynamics, this time as it relates to rockets and space ﬂight. High-speed, supersonic ﬂight hadbecome a dominant feature of aerodynamics by the end of World War II. By thistime, aerodynamicists appreciated the advantages of using slender, pointed bodyshapes to reduce the drag of supersonic vehicles. The more pointed and slenderthe body, the weaker the shock wave attached to the nose, and hence the smallerthe wave drag. Consequently, the German V-2 rocket used during the last stagesof World War II had a pointed nose, and all short-range rocket vehicles ﬂownduring the next decade followed suit. Then, in 1953, the ﬁrst hydrogen bombwas exploded by the United States. This immediately spurred the developmentof long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) to deliver such bombs.These vehicles were designed to ﬂy outside the region of the earth’s atmospherefor distances of 5000 mi or more and to reenter the atmosphere at suborbital speedsof from 20,000 to 22,000 ft/s. At such high velocities, the aerodynamic heating ofthe reentry vehicle becomes severe, and this heating problem dominated the mindsof high-speed aerodynamicists. Their ﬁrst thinking was conventional—a sharp-pointed, slender reentry body. Efforts to minimize aerodynamic heating centeredon the maintenance of laminar boundary layer ﬂow on the vehicle’s surface;such laminar ﬂow produces far less heating than turbulent ﬂow (discussed inChapters 15 and 19). However, nature much prefers turbulent ﬂow, and reentryvehicles are no exception. Therefore, the pointed-nose reentry body was doomedto failure because it would burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the earth’ssurface. However, in 1951, one of those major breakthroughs that come very infre- quently in engineering was created by H. Julian Allen at the NACA (NationalAdvisory Committee for Aeronautics) Ames Aeronautical Laboratory—he in-troduced the concept of the blunt reentry body. His thinking was paced by the following concepts. At the beginning of reentry, near the outer edge of the atmo-sphere, the vehicle has a large amount of kinetic energy due to its high velocityand a large amount of potential energy due to its high altitude. However, by thetime the vehicle reaches the surface of the earth, its velocity is relatively small andits altitude is zero; hence, it has virtually no kinetic or potential energy. Wherehas all the energy gone? The answer is that it has gone into (1) heating the bodyand (2) heating the airﬂow around the body. This is illustrated in Figure 1.9. Here,the shock wave from the nose of the vehicle heats the airﬂow around the vehicle;at the same time, the vehicle is heated by the intense frictional dissipation withinthe boundary layer on the surface. Allen reasoned that if more of the total reentry10 PART 1Fundamental Principles Very high– speed flowHeat transfer into body fromboundary layerHot boundarylayer Shock waveShock waveheats air Figure 1.9 Energy of reentry goes into heating both the body and the air around the body. energy could be dumped into the airﬂow, then less would be available to be trans- ferred to the vehicle itself in the form of heating. In turn, the way to increase theheating of the airﬂow is to create a stronger shock wave at the nose (i.e., to usea blunt-nosed body). The contrast between slender and blunt reentry bodies isillustrated in Figure 1.10. This was a stunning conclusion—to minimize aerody-namic heating, you actually want a blunt rather than a slender body. The result wasso important that it was bottled up in a secret government document. Moreover,because it was so foreign to contemporary intuition, the blunt-reentry-body con-cept was accepted only gradually by the technical community. Over the next fewyears, additional aerodynamic analyses and experiments conﬁrmed the validityof blunt reentry bodies. By 1955, Allen was publicly recognized for his work,receiving the Sylvanus Albert Reed Award of the Institute of the AeronauticalSciences (now the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics). Finally,in 1958, his work was made available to the public in the pioneering documentNACA Report 1381 entitled “A Study of the Motion and Aerodynamic Heating ofBallistic Missiles Entering the Earth’s Atmosphere at High Supersonic Speeds.”Since Harvey Allen’s early work, all successful reentry bodies, from the ﬁrst AtlasICBM to the manned Apollo lunar capsule, have been blunt. Incidentally, Allenwent on to distinguish himself in many other areas, becoming the director of theNASA Ames Research Center in 1965, and retiring in 1970. His work on theblunt reentry body is an excellent example of the importance of aerodynamics tospace vehicle design. In summary, the purpose of this section has been to underscore the importance of aerodynamics in historical context. The goal of this book is to introduce thefundamentals of aerodynamics and to give the reader a much deeper insight tomany technical applications in addition to the few described above. Aerodynamicsis also a subject of intellectual beauty, composed and drawn by many great mindsover the centuries. If you are challenged and interested by these thoughts, or eventhe least bit curious, then read on.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 11 Figure 1.10 Contrast of aerodynamic heating for slender and blunt reentry vehicles.

Put a solid object inside a larger, closed container. The solid object willnot change; its shape and boundaries will remain the same. Now put a liquid insidethe container. The liquid will change its shape to conform to that of the containerand will take on the same boundaries as the container up to the maximum depthof the liquid. Now put a gas inside the container. The gas will completely ﬁll thecontainer, taking on the same boundaries as the container. The word ﬂuid is used to denote either a liquid or a gas. A more technical distinction between a solid and a ﬂuid can be made as follows. When a forceis applied tangentially to the surface of a solid, the solid will experience a ﬁnite deformation, and the tangential force per unit area—the shear stress—will usuallybe proportional to the amount of deformation. In contrast, when a tangential shear12 PART 1Fundamental Principles stress is applied to the surface of a ﬂuid, the ﬂuid will experience a continuously increasing deformation, and the shear stress usually will be proportional to the rate of change of the deformation. The most fundamental distinction between solids, liquids, and gases is at the atomic and molecular level. In a solid, the molecules are packed so closely together that their nuclei and electrons form a rigid geometric structure, “glued”together by powerful intermolecular forces. In a liquid, the spacing betweenmolecules is larger, and although intermolecular forces are still strong, they allowenough movement of the molecules to give the liquid its “ﬂuidity.” In a gas,the spacing between molecules is much larger (for air at standard conditions,the spacing between molecules is, on the average, about 10 times the moleculardiameter). Hence, the inﬂuence of intermolecular forces is much weaker, and themotion of the molecules occurs rather freely throughout the gas. This movementof molecules in both gases and liquids leads to similar physical characteristics,the characteristics of a ﬂuid—quite different from those of a solid. Therefore,it makes sense to classify the study of the dynamics of both liquids and gasesunder the same general heading, called ﬂuid dynamics. On the other hand, certain differences exist between the ﬂow of liquids and the ﬂow of gases; also, differentspecies of gases (say, N 2, He, etc.) have different properties. Therefore, ﬂuid dynamics is subdivided into three areas as follows: Hydrodynamics—ﬂow of liquids Gas dynamics—ﬂow of gasesAerodynamics—ﬂow of air These areas are by no means mutually exclusive; there are many similarities and identical phenomena between them. Also, the word “aerodynamics” has taken ona popular usage that sometimes covers the other two areas. As a result, this authortends to interpret the word aerodynamics very liberally, and its use throughout this book does notalways limit our discussions just to air. Aerodynamics is an applied science with many practical applications in engi- neering. No matter how elegant an aerodynamic theory may be, or how mathemat-ically complex a numerical solution may be, or how sophisticated an aerodynamicexperiment may be, all such efforts are usually aimed at one or more of the fol-lowing practical objectives: 1.The prediction of forces and moments on, and heat transfer to, bodies moving through a ﬂuid (usually air). For example, we are concerned withthe generation of lift, drag, and moments on airfoils, wings, fuselages,engine nacelles, and most importantly, whole airplane conﬁgurations. Wewant to estimate the wind force on buildings, ships, and other surfacevehicles. We are concerned with the hydrodynamic forces on surface ships,submarines, and torpedoes. We need to be able to calculate the aerodynamicheating of ﬂight vehicles ranging from the supersonic transport to aplanetary probe entering the atmosphere of Jupiter. These are but a fewexamples.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 13 Figure 1.11 A CO 2-N2gas-dynamic laser, circa 1969 ( Courtesy of John Anderson). 2.Determination of ﬂows moving internally through ducts. We wish to calculate and measure the ﬂow properties inside rocket and air-breathing jetengines and to calculate the engine thrust. We need to know the ﬂowconditions in the test section of a wind tunnel. We must know how muchﬂuid can ﬂow through pipes under various conditions. A recent, veryinteresting application of aerodynamics is high-energy chemical andgas-dynamic lasers (see Reference 1), which are nothing more thanspecialized wind tunnels that can produce extremely powerful laser beams.Figure 1.11 is a photograph of an early gas-dynamic laser designed in thelate 1960s. The applications in item 1 come under the heading of external aerodynamics since they deal with external ﬂows over a body. In contrast, the applications in item 2involve internal aerodynamics because they deal with ﬂows internally within ducts. In external aerodynamics, in addition to forces, moments, and aerodynamicheating associated with a body, we are frequently interested in the details ofthe ﬂow ﬁeld away from the body. For example, the communication blackoutexperienced by the space shuttle during a portion of its reentry trajectory is due toa concentration of free electrons in the hot shock layer around the body. We needto calculate the variation of electron density throughout such ﬂow ﬁelds. Anotherexample is the propagation of shock waves in a supersonic ﬂow; for instance, does14 PART 1Fundamental Principles the shock wave from the wing of a supersonic airplane impinge upon and interfere with the tail surfaces? Yet another example is the ﬂow associated with the strongvortices trailing downstream from the wing tips of large subsonic airplanes suchas the Boeing 747. What are the properties of these vortices, and how do theyaffect smaller aircraft which happen to ﬂy through them? The above is just a sample of the myriad applications of aerodynamics. One purpose of this book is to provide the reader with the technical background nec-essary to fully understand the nature of such practical aerodynamic applications. Figure 1.12 Road map for Chapter 1.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 15 1.3 ROAD MAP FOR THIS CHAPTER When learning a new subject, it is important for you to know where you are, where you are going, and how you can get there. Therefore, at the beginning ofeach chapter in this book, a road map will be given to help guide you through thematerial of that chapter and to help you obtain a perspective as to how the materialﬁts within the general framework of aerodynamics. For example, a road map forChapter 1 is given in Figure 1.12. You will want to frequently refer back to theseroad maps as you progress through the individual chapters. When you reach theend of each chapter, look back over the road map to see where you started, whereyou are now, and what you learned in between. 1.4 SOME FUNDAMENTAL AERODYNAMIC VARIABLES A prerequisite to understanding physical science and engineering is simply learn-ing the vocabulary used to describe concepts and phenomena. Aerodynamics isno exception. Throughout this book, and throughout your working career, youwill be adding to your technical vocabulary list. Let us start by deﬁning four ofthe most frequently used words in aerodynamics: pressure, density, temperature, andﬂow velocity. 1 Consider a surface immersed in a ﬂuid. The surface can be a real, solid surface such as the wall of a duct or the surface of a body; it can also be a free surfacewhich we simply imagine drawn somewhere in the middle of a ﬂuid. Also, keepin mind that the molecules of the ﬂuid are constantly in motion. Pressure is the normal force per unit area exerted on a surface due to the time rate of changeof momentum of the gas molecules impacting on (or crossing) that surface. It isimportant to note that even though pressure is deﬁned as force “per unit area,”you do not need a surface that is exactly 1 ft 2o r1m2to talk about pressure. In fact, pressure is usually deﬁned at a point in the ﬂuid or a point on a solid surface and can vary from one point to another. To see this more clearly, consider a point Bin a volume of ﬂuid. Let dA=elemental area at B dF=force on one side of dAdue to pressure Then, the pressure at point Bin the ﬂuid is deﬁned as p=lim/parenleftbiggdF dA/parenrightbigg dA→0 The pressure pis the limiting form of the force per unit area, where the area of interest has shrunk to nearly zero at the point B.2Clearly, you can see that pressure 1A basic introduction to these quantities is given on pages 56–61 of Reference 2. 2Strictly speaking, dAcan never achieve the limit of zero, because there would be no molecules at point Bin that case. The above limit should be interpreted as dAapproaching a very small value, near zero in terms of our macroscopic thinking, but sufﬁciently larger than the average spacing between molecules on a microscopic basis.16 PART 1Fundamental Principles is apoint property and can have a different value from one point to another in the ﬂuid. Another important aerodynamic variable is density, deﬁned as the mass per unit volume. Analogous to our discussion on pressure, the deﬁnition of density does not require an actual volume of 1 ft3o r1m3. Rather, it is a point property that can vary from point to point in the ﬂuid. Again, consider a point Bin the ﬂuid. Let dv=elemental volume around B dm=mass of ﬂuid inside dv Then, the density at point Bis ρ=limdm dvdv→0 Therefore, the density ρis the limiting form of the mass per unit volume, where the volume of interest has shrunk to nearly zero around point B. (Note that dvcannot achieve the value of zero for the reason discussed in the footnote concerning dA in the deﬁnition of pressure.) Temperature takes on an important role in high-speed aerodynamics (intro- duced in Chapter 7). The temperature Tof a gas is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecules of the ﬂuid. In fact, if KE is the meanmolecular kinetic energy, then temperature is given by KE = 3 2kT, where kis the Boltzmann constant. Hence, we can qualitatively visualize a high-temperaturegas as one in which the molecules and atoms are randomly rattling about at highspeeds, whereas in a low-temperature gas, the random motion of the molecules isrelatively slow. Temperature is also a point property, which can vary from pointto point in the gas. The principal focus of aerodynamics is ﬂuids in motion. Hence, ﬂow velocity is an extremely important consideration. The concept of the velocity of a ﬂuid isslightly more subtle than that of a solid body in motion. Consider a solid objectin translational motion, say, moving at 30 m/s. Then all parts of the solid aresimultaneously translating at the same 30 m/s velocity. In contrast, a ﬂuid isa “squishy” substance, and for a ﬂuid in motion, one part of the ﬂuid may betraveling at a different velocity from another part. Hence, we have to adopt acertain perspective, as follows. Consider the ﬂow of air over an airfoil, as shownin Figure 1.13. Lock your eyes on a speciﬁc, inﬁnitesimally small element of mass Figure 1.13 Illustration of ﬂow velocity and streamlines.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 17 in the gas, called a ﬂuid element, and watch this element move with time. Both the speed and direction of this ﬂuid element can vary as it moves from point to point in the gas. Now ﬁx your eyes on a speciﬁc ﬁxed point in space, say, point B in Figure 1.13. Flow velocity can now be deﬁned as follows: The velocity of a ﬂowing gas at any ﬁxed point Bin space is the velocity of an inﬁnitesimally small ﬂuid element as it sweeps through B. The ﬂow velocity Vhas both magnitude and direction; hence, it is a vector quantity. This is in contrast to p,ρ, and T, which are scalar variables. The scalar magnitude of Vis frequently used and is denoted by V. Again, we emphasize that velocity is a point property and can vary from point to point in the ﬂow. Referring again to Figure 1.13, a moving ﬂuid element traces out a ﬁxed path in space. As long as the ﬂow is steady (i.e., as long as it does not ﬂuctuatewith time), this path is called a streamline of the ﬂow. Drawing the streamlines of the ﬂow ﬁeld is an important way of visualizing the motion of the gas; we willfrequently be sketching the streamlines of the ﬂow about various objects. A morerigorous discussion of streamlines is given in Chapter 2. Finally, we note that friction can play a role internally in a ﬂow. Consider two adjacent streamlines aandbas sketched in Figure 1.14. The streamlines are an inﬁnitesimal distance, dy, apart. At point 1 on streamline bthe ﬂow velocity isV;at point 2 on streamline athe ﬂow velocity is slightly higher, V+dV. You can imagine that streamline ais rubbing against streamline band, due to friction, exerts a force of magnitude dF fon streamline bacting tangentially toward the right. Furthermore, imagine this force acting on an elemental area dA, where dA is perpendicular to the yaxis and tangent to the streamline bat point 1. The local shear stress, τ, at point 1 is τ=lim/parenleftbiggdF f dA/parenrightbigg dA→0 The shear stress τis the limiting form of the magnitude of the frictional force per unit area, where the area of interest is perpendicular to the yaxis and has shrunk a bdFfVy dyV + dV 12 Figure 1.14 Generation of frictional force due to a velocity gradient in a ﬂow.18 PART 1Fundamental Principles to nearly zero at point 1. Shear stress acts tangentially along the streamline. For the type of gases and liquids of interest in aerodynamic applications, the valueof the shear stress at a point on a streamline is proportional to the spatial rateof change of velocity normal to the streamline at that point (i.e., for the ﬂowillustrated in Figure 1.14, τ∝dV/dy). The constant of proportionality is deﬁned as the viscosity coefﬁcient, μ. Hence, τ=μdV dy where dV/dyis the velocity gradient. In reality, μis not really a constant; it is a function of the temperature of the ﬂuid. We will discuss these matters in moredetail in Section 1.11. From the above equation, we deduce that in regions ofa ﬂow ﬁeld where the velocity gradients are small, τis small and the inﬂuence of friction locally in the ﬂow is small. On the other hand, in regions where thevelocity gradients are large, τis large and the inﬂuence of friction locally in the ﬂow can be substantial. 1.4.1 Units Two consistent sets of units will be used throughout this book, SI units (SystemeInternational d’Unites) and the English engineering system of units. The basicunits of force, mass, length, time, and absolute temperature in these two systemsare given in Table 1.1. For example, units of pressure and shear stress are lb/ft 2or N/m2, units of density are slug/ft3or kg/m3, and units of velocity are ft/s or m/s. When a consistent set of units is used, physical relationships are written without theneed for conversion factors in the basic formulas; they are written in the pureform intended by nature. Consistent units will always be used in this book. Foran extensive discussion on units and the signiﬁcance of consistent units versusnonconsistent units, see pages 65–70 of Reference 2. The SI system of units (metric units) is the standard system of units throughout most of the world today. In contrast, for more than two centuries the Englishengineering system (or some variant) was the primary system of units in theUnited States and England. This situation is changing rapidly, especially in theaerospace industry in the United States and England. Nevertheless, a familiaritywith both systems of units is still important today. For example, even though mostengineering work in the future will deal with the SI units, there exists a huge bulk of Table 1.1 Force Mass Length Time Temp. SI Units Newton kilogram meter second Kelvin (N) (kg) (m) (s) (K) English pounds slug feet second deg. Rankine Engineering (lb) (ft) (s) (◦R) UnitsCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 19 present and past engineering literature written in the English engineering system, literature that will be used well into the future. The modern engineering studentmust be bilingual in these units, and must feel comfortable with both systems.For this reason, although many of the worked examples and end-of-the-chapterproblems in this book are in the SI units, some are in the English engineeringsystem of units. You are encouraged to join this bilingual spirit and to work tomake yourself comfortable in both systems. 1.5 AERODYNAMIC FORCES AND MOMENTS At ﬁrst glance, the generation of the aerodynamic force on a giant Boeing 747may seem complex, especially in light of the complicated three-dimensional ﬂowﬁeld over the wings, fuselage, engine nacelles, tail, etc. Similarly, the aerody-namic resistance on an automobile traveling at 55 mi/h on the highway involvesa complex interaction of the body, the air, and the ground. However, in these andall other cases, the aerodynamic forces and moments on the body are due to onlytwo basic sources: 1.Pressure distribution over the body surface 2.Shear stress distribution over the body surface No matter how complex the body shape may be, the aerodynamic forces and moments on the body are due entirely to the above two basic sources. The only mechanisms nature has for communicating a force to a body moving through aﬂuid are pressure and shear stress distributions on the body surface. Both pressure pand shear stress τhave dimensions of force per unit area (pounds per square foot or newtons per square meter). As sketched in Figure 1.15, pactsnormal to the surface, and τactstangential to the surface. Shear stress is due to the “tugging action” on the surface, which is caused by friction between the body and the air(and is studied in great detail in Chapters 15 to 20). The net effect of the pandτdistributions integrated over the complete body surface is a resultant aerodynamic force Rand moment Mon the body, as sketched in Figure 1.16. In turn, the resultant Rcan be split into components, two sets of Figure 1.15 Illustration of pressure and shear stress on an aerodynamic surface.20 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 1.16 Resultant aerodynamic force and moment on the body. Figure 1.17 Resultant aerodynamic force and the components into which it splits. which are shown in Figure 1.17. In Figure 1.17, V∞is the relative wind, deﬁned as the ﬂow velocity far ahead of the body. The ﬂow far away from the body is called the freestream, and hence V∞is also called the freestream velocity. In Figure 1.17, by deﬁnition, L≡lift≡component of Rperpendicular to V∞ D≡drag≡component of Rparallel to V∞ The chord cis the linear distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the body. Sometimes, Ris split into components perpendicular and parallel to the chord, as also shown in Figure 1.17. By deﬁnition, N≡normal force ≡component of Rperpendicular to c A≡axial force ≡component of Rparallel to c The angle of attack αis deﬁned as the angle between candV∞. Hence, αis also the angle between LandNand between DandA. The geometrical relation between these two sets of components is, from Figure 1.17, L=Ncosα−Asinα (1.1) D=Nsinα+Acosα (1.2)CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 21 Figure 1.18 Nomenclature for the integration of pressure and shear stress distributions over a two-dimensional body surface. Let us examine in more detail the integration of the pressure and shear stress distributions to obtain the aerodynamic forces and moments. Consider the two- dimensional body sketched in Figure 1.18. The chord line is drawn horizontally,and hence the relative wind is inclined relative to the horizontal by the angle ofattack α. An xycoordinate system is oriented parallel and perpendicular, respec- tively, to the chord. The distance from the leading edge measured along the bodysurface to an arbitrary point Aon the upper surface is s u; similarly, the distance to an arbitrary point Bon the lower surface is sl. The pressure and shear stress on the upper surface are denoted by puandτu, both puandτuare functions of su. Similarly, plandτlare the corresponding quantities on the lower surface and are functions of sl. At a given point, the pressure is normal to the surface and is oriented at an angle θrelative to the perpendicular; shear stress is tangential to the surface and is oriented at the same angle θrelative to the horizontal. In Figure 1.18, the sign convention for θis positive when measured clockwise from the vertical line to the direction of pand from the horizontal line to the direction ofτ. In Figure 1.18, all thetas are shown in their positive direction. Now con- sider the two-dimensional shape in Figure 1.18 as a cross section of an inﬁnitelylong cylinder of uniform section. A unit span of such a cylinder is shown inFigure 1.19. Consider an elemental surface area dSof this cylinder, where dS= (ds)(1) as shown by the shaded area in Figure 1.19. We are interested in the contribution to the total normal force N /primeand the total axial force A/primedue to the pressure and shear stress on the elemental area dS. The primes on N/primeand A/prime denote force per unit span. Examining both Figures 1.18 and 1.19, we see thatthe elemental normal and axial forces acting on the elemental surface dSon the22 PART 1Fundamental Principles s yp /H9270 /H9251xl V/H11009ds Figure 1.19 Aerodynamic force on an element of the body surface. upper body surface are dN/prime u=− pudsucosθ−τudsusinθ (1.3) dA/prime u=− pudsusinθ+τudsucosθ (1.4) On the lower body surface, we have dN/prime l=pldslcosθ−τldslsinθ (1.5) dA/prime l=pldslsinθ+τldslcosθ (1.6) In Equations (1.3) to (1.6), the positive directions of N/primeandA/primeare those shown in Figure 1.17. In these equations, the positive clockwise convention for θmust be followed. For example, consider again Figure 1.18. Near the leading edge of the body, where the slope of the upper body surface is positive, τis inclined upward, and hence it gives a positive contribution to N/prime. For an upward inclined τ,θwould be counterclockwise, hence negative. Therefore, in Equation (1.3), sin θwould be negative, making the shear stress term (the last term) a positive value, as itshould be in this instance. Hence, Equations (1.3) to (1.6) hold in general (forboth the forward and rearward portions of the body) as long as the above signconvention for θis consistently applied. The total normal and axial forces per unit span are obtained by integrating Equations (1.3) to (1.6) from the leading edge (LE) to the trailing edge (TE): N /prime=−/integraldisplayTE LE(pucosθ+τusinθ)dsu+/integraldisplayTE LE(plcosθ−τlsinθ)dsl(1.7) A/prime=/integraldisplayTE LE(−pusinθ+τucosθ)dsu+/integraldisplayTE LE(plsinθ+τlcosθ)dsl(1.8)CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 23 Figure 1.20 Sign convention for aerodynamic moments. In turn, the total lift and drag per unit span can be obtained by inserting Equa- tions (1.7) and (1.8) into (1.1) and (1.2); note that Equations (1.1) and (1.2) holdfor forces on an arbitrarily shaped body (unprimed) and for the forces per unitspan (primed). The aerodynamic moment exerted on the body depends on the point about which moments are taken. Consider moments taken about the leading edge. Byconvention, moments that tend to increase α(pitch up) are positive, and moments that tend to decrease α(pitch down) are negative. This convention is illustrated in Figure 1.20. Returning again to Figures 1.18 and 1.19, the moment per unitspan about the leading edge due to pandτon the elemental area dSon the upper surface is dM /prime u=(pucosθ+τusinθ)x ds u+(−pusinθ+τucosθ)y ds u (1.9) On the bottom surface, dM/prime l=(−plcosθ+τlsinθ)x ds l+(plsinθ+τlcosθ)y ds l (1.10) In Equations (1.9) and (1.10), note that the same sign convention for θapplies as before and that yis a positive number above the chord and a negative number below the chord. Integrating Equations (1.9) and (1.10) from the leading to thetrailing edges, we obtain for the moment about the leading edge per unit span M /prime LE=/integraldisplayTE LE[(pucosθ+τusinθ)x−(pusinθ−τucosθ)y]dsu (1.11) +/integraldisplayTE LE[(−plcosθ+τlsinθ)x+(plsinθ+τlcosθ)y]dsl In Equations (1.7), (1.8), and (1.11), θ,x, and yare known functions of s for a given body shape. Hence, if pu,pl,τu, andτlare known as functions of s (from theory or experiment), the integrals in these equations can be evaluated.Clearly, Equations (1.7), (1.8), and (1.11) demonstrate the principle stated earlier,namely, the sources of the aerodynamic lift, drag, and moments on a body are the pressure and shear stress distributions integrated over the body. A major goal of theoretical aerodynamics is to calculate p(s)andτ(s)for a given body shape and freestream conditions, thus yielding the aerodynamic forces and momentsvia Equations (1.7), (1.8), and (1.11). As our discussions of aerodynamics progress, it will become clear that there are quantities of an even more fundamental nature than the aerodynamic forcesand moments themselves. These are dimensionless force and moment coefﬁcients, deﬁned as follows. Let ρ ∞andV∞be the density and velocity, respectively, in24 PART 1Fundamental Principles the freestream, far ahead of the body. We deﬁne a dimensional quantity called the freestream dynamic pressure as Dynamic pressure: q∞≡1 2ρ∞V2 ∞ The dynamic pressure has the units of pressure (i.e., pounds per square footor newtons per square meter). In addition, let Sbe a reference area and lbe a reference length. The dimensionless force and moment coefﬁcients are deﬁnedas follows: Lift coefﬁcient: C L≡L q∞S Drag coefﬁcient: CD≡D q∞S Normal force coefﬁcient: CN≡N q∞S Axial force coefﬁcient: CA≡A q∞S Moment coefﬁcient: CM≡M q∞Sl In the above coefﬁcients, the reference area Sand reference length lare chosen to pertain to the given geometric body shape; for different shapes, Sandlmay be different things. For example, for an airplane wing, Sis the planform area, and l is the mean chord length, as illustrated in Figure 1.21 a. However, for a sphere, Sis the cross-sectional area, and lis the diameter, as shown in Figure 1.21b . Figure 1.21 Some reference areas and lengths.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 25 The particular choice of reference area and length is not critical; however, when using force and moment coefﬁcient data, you must always know what referencequantities the particular data are based upon. The symbols in capital letters listed above (i.e., C L,CD,CM, and CA) denote the force and moment coefﬁcients for a complete three-dimensional body suchas an airplane or a ﬁnite wing. In contrast, for a two-dimensional body, such asgiven in Figures 1.18 and 1.19, the forces and moments are per unit span. For thesetwo-dimensional bodies, it is conventional to denote the aerodynamic coefﬁcientsby lowercase letters; for example, c l≡L/prime q∞ccd≡D/prime q∞ccm≡M/prime q∞c2 where the reference area S=c(1)=c. Two additional dimensionless quantities of immediate use are Pressure coefﬁcient: Cp≡p−p∞ q∞ Skin friction coefﬁcient: cf≡τ q∞ where p∞is the freestream pressure. The most useful forms of Equations (1.7), (1.8), and (1.11) are in terms of the dimensionless coefﬁcients introduced above. From the geometry shown inFigure 1.22, dx=dscosθ (1.12) dy=−(dssinθ) (1.13) S=c(1) (1.14) Substituting Equations (1.12) and (1.13) into Equations (1.7), (1.8), and (1.11),dividing by q ∞, and further dividing by Sin the form of Equation (1.14), we Figure 1.22 Geometrical relationship of differential lengths.26 PART 1Fundamental Principles obtain the following integral forms for the force and moment coefﬁcients: cn=1 c/bracketleftbigg/integraldisplayc 0(Cp,l−Cp,u)dx+/integraldisplayc 0/parenleftbigg cf,udyu dx+cf,ldyl dx/parenrightbigg dx/bracketrightbigg (1.15) ca=1 c/bracketleftbigg/integraldisplayc 0/parenleftbigg Cp,udyu dx−Cp,ldyl dx/parenrightbigg dx+/integraldisplayc 0(cf,u+cf,l)dx/bracketrightbigg (1.16) cmLE=1 c2/bracketleftbigg/integraldisplayc 0(Cp,u−Cp,l)x dx−/integraldisplayc 0/parenleftbigg cf,udyu dx+cf,ldyl dx/parenrightbigg x dx (1.17) +/integraldisplayc 0/parenleftbigg Cp,udyu dx+cf,u/parenrightbigg yudx+/integraldisplayc 0/parenleftbigg −Cp,ldyl dx+cf,l/parenrightbigg yldx/bracketrightbigg The simple algebraic steps are left as an exercise for the reader. When evaluating these integrals, keep in mind that yuis directed above the xaxis, and hence is positive, whereas ylis directed below the xaxis, and hence is negative. Also, dy/dxon both the upper and lower surfaces follow the usual rule from calculus (i.e., positive for those portions of the body with a positive slope and negative forthose portions with a negative slope). The lift and drag coefﬁcients can be obtained from Equations (1.1) and (1.2) cast in coefﬁcient form: c l=cncosα−casinα (1.18) cd=cnsinα+cacosα (1.19) Integral forms for clandcdare obtained by substituting Equations (1.15) and (1.16) into (1.18) and (1.19). It is important to note from Equations (1.15) through (1.19) that the aerody- namic force and moment coefﬁcients can be obtained by integrating the pressureand skin friction coefﬁcients over the body. This is a common procedure in boththeoretical and experimental aerodynamics. In addition, although our derivationshave used a two-dimensional body, an analogous development can be presentedfor three-dimensional bodies—the geometry and equations only get more com-plex and involved—the principle is the same. EXAMPLE 1.1 Consider the supersonic ﬂow over a 5◦half-angle wedge at zero angle of attack, as sketched in Figure 1.23 a. The freestream Mach number ahead of the wedge is 2.0, and the freestream pressure and density are 1.01 ×105N/m2and 1.23 kg/m3, respectively (this corresponds to standard sea level conditions). The pressures on the upper and lower surfaces of the wedge are constant with distance sand equal to each other, namely, pu=pl=1.31×105N/m2, as shown in Figure 1.23b . The pressure exerted on the base of the wedge is equal to p∞. As seen in Figure 1.23c , the shear stress varies over both the upper and lower surfaces as τw=431s−0.2. The chord length, c, of the wedge is 2 m. Calculate the drag coefﬁcient for the wedge.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 27 Figure 1.23 Illustration for Example 1.1.28 PART 1Fundamental Principles ■Solution We will carry out this calculation in two equivalent ways. First, we calculate the drag from Equation (1.8), and then obtain the drag coefﬁcient. In turn, as an illustration of analternate approach, we convert the pressure and shear stress to pressure coefﬁcient andskin friction coefﬁcient, and then use Equation (1.16) to obtain the drag coefﬁcient. Since the wedge in Figure 1.23 is at zero angle of attack, then D /prime=A/prime. Thus, the drag can be obtained from Equation (1.8) as D/prime=/integraldisplayTE LE(−pusinθ+τucosθ)dsu+/integraldisplayTE LE(plsinθ+τlcosθ)dsl Referring to Figure 1.23c , recalling the sign convention for θ, and noting that integration over the upper surface goes from s1tos2on the inclined surface and from s2tos3on the base, whereas integration over the bottom surface goes from s1tos4on the inclined surface and from s4tos3on the base, we ﬁnd that the above integrals become /integraldisplayTE LE−pusinθdsu=/integraldisplays2 s1−(1.31 ×105)sin(−5◦)dsu +/integraldisplays3 s2−(1.01 ×105)sin 90◦dsu =1.142×104(s2−s1)−1.01×105(s3−s2) =1.142×104/parenleftBigc cos 5◦/parenrightBig −1.01×105(c)(tan 5◦) =1.142×104(2.008) −1.01×105(0.175) =5260 N /integraldisplayTE LEplsinθdsl=/integraldisplays4 s1(1.31×105)sin(5◦)dsl+/integraldisplays3 s4(1.01×105)sin(−90◦)dsl =1.142×104(s4−s1)+1.01×105(−1)(s 3−s4) =1.142×104/parenleftBigc cos 5◦/parenrightBig −1.01×105(c)(tan 5◦) =2.293×104−1.767×104=5260 N Note that the integrals of the pressure over the top and bottom surfaces, respectively,yield the same contribution to the drag—a result to be expected from the symmetry of theconﬁguration in Figure 1.23: /integraldisplayTE LEτucosθdsu=/integraldisplays2 s1431s−0.2cos(−5◦)dsu =429/parenleftBigg s0.8 2−s0.8 1 0.8/parenrightBigg =429/parenleftBigc cos 5◦/parenrightBig0.81 0.8=936.5NCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 29 /integraldisplayTE LEτlcosθdsl=/integraldisplays4 s1431s−0.2cos(−5◦)dsl =429/parenleftbiggs0.8 4−s0.8 1 0.8/parenrightbigg =429/parenleftBigc cos 5◦/parenrightBig0.81 0.8=936.5N Again, it is no surprise that the shear stresses acting over the upper and lower surfaces, respectively, give equal contributions to the drag; this is to be expected due to the symmetryof the wedge shown in Figure 1.23. Adding the pressure integrals, and then adding theshear stress integrals, we have for total drag D /prime=1.052×104 /bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright pressure drag+0.1873 ×104 /bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright skin friction drag=1.24×104N Note that, for this rather slender body, but at a supersonic speed, most of the drag is pressuredrag. Referring to Figure 1.23 a, we see that this is due to the presence of an oblique shock wave from the nose of the body, which acts to create pressure drag (sometimes called wave drag). In this example, only 15 percent of the drag is skin friction drag; the other 85 percent is the pressure drag (wave drag). This is typical of the drag of slender supersonic bodies.In contrast, as we will see later, the drag of a slender body at subsonic speed, where thereis no shock wave, is mainly skin friction drag. The drag coefﬁcient is obtained as follows. The velocity of the freestream is twice the sonic speed, which is given by a ∞=/radicalbig γRT∞=/radicalbig (1.4)(287)(288) =340.2 m/s (See Chapter 8 for a derivation of this expression for the speed of sound.) Note that, inthe above, the standard sea level temperature of 288 K is used. Hence, V ∞=2(340.2) = 680.4 m/s. Thus, q∞=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞=(0.5)(1.23)(680.4)2=2.847×105N/m2 Also, S=c(1)=2.0m2 Hence,cd=D/prime q∞S=1.24×104 (2.847 ×105)(2)=0.022 An alternate solution to this problem is to use Equation (1.16), integrating the pressure coefﬁcients and skin friction coefﬁcients to obtain directly the drag coefﬁcient.

EXAMPLE 1.2 Consider a cone at zero angle of attack in a hypersonic ﬂow. (Hypersonic ﬂow is very high-speed ﬂow, generally deﬁned as any ﬂow above a Mach number of 5; hypersonicﬂow is further deﬁned in Section 1.10.) The half-angle of the cone is θ c, as shown in Figure 1.24. An approximate expression for the pressure coefﬁcient on the surface of ahypersonic body is given by the newtonian sine-squared law (to be derived in Chapter 14): C p=2 sin2θc Note that Cp, hence, p, is constant along the inclined surface of the cone. Along the base of the body, we assume that p=p∞. Neglecting the effect of friction, obtain an expression for the drag coefﬁcient of the cone, where CDis based on the area of the base Sb. ■Solution We cannot use Equations (1.15) to (1.17) here. These equations are expressed for a two-dimensional body, such as the airfoil shown in Figure 1.22, whereas the cone in Figure 1.24is a shape in three-dimensional space. Hence, we must treat this three-dimensional bodyas follows. From Figure 1.24, the drag force on the shaded strip of surface area is (psinθ c)(2π r)dr sinθc=2πrp drCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 31 rsin /H9258cShock wave /H9258c drxrrbp cdx p/H11009 Figure 1.24 Illustration for Example 1.2.

Hence, using the newtonian sine-squared law, we obtain CD=2 sin2θc 1.6 CENTER OF PRESSURE From Equations (1.7) and (1.8), we see that the normal and axial forces on the body are due to the distributed loads imposed by the pressure and shear stress distributions. Moreover, these distributed loads generate a moment about theleading edge, as given by Equation (1.11). Question: If the aerodynamic force on a body is speciﬁed in terms of a resultant single force R, or its components such as NandA,where on the body should this resultant be placed? The answer is that the resultant force should be located on the body such that it producesthe same effect as the distributed loads. For example, the distributed load on atwo-dimensional body such as an airfoil produces a moment about the leadingedge given by Equation (1.11); therefore, N /primeandA/primemust be placed on the airfoil at such a location to generate the same moment about the leading edge. If A/primeis placed on the chord line as shown in Figure 1.25, then N/primemust be located at a distance xcpdownstream of the leading edge such that M/prime LE=−(xcp)N/prime xcp=−M/prime LE N/prime(1.20) In Figure 1.25, the direction of the curled arrow illustrating M/prime LEis drawn in the positive (pitch-up) sense. (From Section 1.5, recall the standard convention thataerodynamic moments are positive if they tend to increase the angle of attack.)Examining Figure 1.25, we see that a positive N /primecreates a negative (pitch-down) moment about the leading edge. This is consistent with the negative sign inEquation (1.20). Therefore, in Figure 1.25, the actual moment about the leadingedge is negative, and hence is in a direction opposite to the curled arrow shown. Figure 1.25 Center of pressure for an airfoil.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 33 Figure 1.26 Equivalent ways of specifying the force-and-moment system on an airfoil. In Figure 1.25 and Equation (1.20), xcpis deﬁned as the center of pressure. It is the location where the resultant of a distributed load effectively acts on the body. If moments were taken about the center of pressure, the integrated effect ofthe distributed loads would be zero. Hence, an alternate deﬁnition of the center ofpressure is that point on the body about which the aerodynamic moment is zero. In cases where the angle of attack of the body is small, sin α≈0 and cosα≈1; hence, from Equation (1.1), L /prime≈N/prime. Thus, Equation (1.20) becomes xcp≈−M/prime LE L/prime(1.21) Examine Equations (1.20) and (1.21). As N/primeandL/primedecrease, xcpincreases. As the forces approach zero, the center of pressure moves to inﬁnity. For thisreason, the center of pressure is not always a convenient concept in aerodynamics.However, this is no problem. To deﬁne the force-and-moment system due to adistributed load on a body, the resultant force can be placed at anypoint on the body, as long as the value of the moment about that point is also given. Forexample, Figure 1.26 illustrates three equivalent ways of specifying the force-and-moment system on an airfoil. In the left ﬁgure, the resultant is placed atthe leading edge, with a ﬁnite value of M /prime LE. In the middle ﬁgure, the resultant is placed at the quarter-chord point, with a ﬁnite value of M/prime c/4. In the right ﬁgure, the resultant is placed at the center of pressure, with a zero moment about that point.By inspection of Figure 1.26, the quantitative relation between these cases is M /prime LE=−c 4L/prime+M/prime c/4=−xcpL/prime(1.22) EXAMPLE 1.3 In low-speed, incompressible ﬂow, the following experimental data are obtained for an NACA 4412 airfoil section at an angle of attack of 4◦:cl=0.85 and cm,c/4=− 0.09. Calculate the location of the center of pressure.34 PART 1Fundamental Principles ■Solution From Equation (1.22), xcp=c 4−M/prime c/4 L/prime xcp c=1 4−(Mc/4/q∞c2) (L/prime/q∞c)=1 4−cm,c/4 cl =1 4−(−0.09) 0.85=0.356 (Note: In Chapter 4, we will learn that, for a thin, symmetrical airfoil, the center of pressure is at the quarter-chord location. However, for the NACA 4412 airfoil, which is not symmetric, the center-of-pressure location is behind the quarter-chord point.) EXAMPLE 1.4 Consider the DC-3 shown in Figure 1.1. Just outboard of the engine nacelle, the airfoilchord length is 15.4 ft. At cruising velocity (188 mi/h) at sea level, the moments perunit span at this airfoil location are M /prime c/4=−1071 ft lb/ft and M/primeLE=−3213.9 ft lb/ft. Calculate the lift per unit span and the location of the center of pressure on the airfoil. ■Solution From Equation (1.22), c 4L/prime=M/prime c/4−M/prime LE=−1071−(−3213.9) =2142.9 At this airfoil location on the wing,c 4=15.4 4=3.85 ft. Thus, L/prime=2142.9 3.85=556.6 lb/ft Returning to Equation (1.22), −xcpL/prime=M/prime LE −xcp=−M/prime LE L/prime=−(−3213.9) 556.6=5.774 ft Note: In this section, we have shown that the force and moment system acting on an airfoil is uniquely speciﬁed by giving the lift acting at any point on the airfoil and the momentabout that point. Analogously, this example proves that the force and moment system isalso uniquely speciﬁed by giving the moments acting about any two points on the airfoil. 1.7 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS: THE BUCKINGHAM PI THEOREM The aerodynamic forces and moments on a body, and the corresponding force and moment coefﬁcients, have been deﬁned and discussed in Section 1.5. Question:CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 35 What physical quantities determine the variation of these forces and moments? The answer can be found from the powerful method of dimensional analysis, which is introduced in this section.3 Consider a body of given shape at a given angle of attack (e.g., the airfoil sketched in Figure 1.17). The resultant aerodynamic force is R. On a physical, intuitive basis, we expect Rto depend on: 1.Freestream velocity V∞. 2.Freestream density ρ∞. 3.Viscosity of the ﬂuid. We have seen that shear stress τcontributes to the aerodynamic forces and moments, and that τis proportional to the velocity gradients in the ﬂow. For example, if the velocity gradient is given by∂u/∂y, thenτ=μ∂u/∂y. The constant of proportionality is the viscosity coefﬁcient μ. Hence, let us represent the inﬂuence of viscosity on aero- dynamic forces and moments by the freestream viscosity coefﬁcient μ ∞. 4.The size of the body, represented by some chosen reference length. InFigure 1.17, the convenient reference length is the chord length c. 5.The compressibility of the ﬂuid. The technical deﬁnition of compressibilityis given in Chapter 7. For our present purposes, let us just say thatcompressibility is related to the variation of density throughout the ﬂow ﬁeld, and certainly the aerodynamic forces and moments should besensitive to any such variation. In turn, compressibility is related to thespeed of sound ain the ﬂuid, as shown in Chapter 8. 4Therefore, let us represent the inﬂuence of compressibility on aerodynamic forces andmoments by the freestream speed of sound, a ∞. In light of the above, and without any a priori knowledge about the variation of R, we can use common sense to write R=f(ρ∞,V∞,c,μ∞,a∞) (1.23) Equation (1.23) is a general functional relation, and as such is not very practicalfor the direct calculation of R. In principle, we could mount the given body in a wind tunnel, incline it at the given angle of attack, and then systematically measurethe variation of Rdue to variations of ρ ∞,V∞,c,μ∞, and a∞, taken one at a time. By cross-plotting the vast bulk of data thus obtained, we might be able to extracta precise functional relation for Equation (1.23). However, it would be hard work,and it would certainly be costly in terms of a huge amount of required wind-tunneltime. Fortunately, we can simplify the problem and considerably reduce our timeand effort by ﬁrst employing the method of dimensional analysis. This method will 3For a more elementary treatment of dimensional analysis, see Chapter 5 of Reference 2. 4Common experience tells us that sound waves propagate through air at some ﬁnite velocity, much slower than the speed of light; you see a ﬂash of lightning in the distance, and hear the thunder moments later. The speed of sound is an important physical quantity in aerodynamics and is discussed in detail inSection 8.3.36 PART 1Fundamental Principles deﬁne a set of dimensionless parameters that governs the aerodynamic forces and moments; this set will considerably reduce the number of independent variablesas presently occurs in Equation (1.23). Dimensional analysis is based on the obvious fact that in an equation dealing with the real physical world, each term must have the same dimensions. Forexample, if ψ+η+ζ=φ is a physical relation, then ψ,η,ζ, andφmust have the same dimensions. Other- wise we would be adding apples and oranges. The above equation can be madedimensionless by dividing by any one of the terms, say, φ: ψ φ+η φ+ζ φ=1 These ideas are formally embodied in the Buckingham pi theorem, stated belowwithout derivation. (See Reference 3, pages 21–28, for such a derivation.) Buckingham pi Theorem LetKequal the number of fundamental dimensions required to describe the physical variables. (In mechanics, all physical variables can be expressed in terms of the dimensions of mass, length, andtime; hence, K=3.) Let P1,P2,..., PNrepresent Nphysical variables in the physical relation f1(P1,P2,..., PN)=0 (1.24) Then, the physical relation Equation (1.24) may be reexpressed as a relation of(N−K)dimensionless products (called /Pi1products), f 2(/Pi11,/Pi12,...,/Pi1 N−K)=0 (1.25) where each /Pi1product is a dimensionless product of a set of Kphysical variables plus one other physical variable. Let P1,P2,..., PKbe the selected set of K physical variables. Then /Pi11=f3(P1,P2,..., PK,PK+1) (1.26) /Pi12=f4(P1,P2,..., PK,PK+2) ................................ /Pi1N−K=f5(P1,P2,..., PK,PN) The choice of the repeating variables, P1,P2,..., PKshould be such that they include alltheKdimensions used in the problem. Also, the dependent variable [such as Rin Equation (1.23)] should appear in only one of the /Pi1products.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 37 Returning to our consideration of the aerodynamic force on a given body at a given angle of attack, Equation (1.23) can be written in the form of Equa- tion (1.24): g(R,ρ∞,V∞,c,μ∞,a∞)=0 (1.27) Following the Buckingham pi theorem, the fundamental dimensions are m=dimensions of mass l=dimension of length t=dimension of time Hence, K=3. The physical variables and their dimensions are [R]=mlt−2 [ρ∞]=ml−3 [V∞]=lt−1 [c]=l [μ∞]=ml−1t−1 [a∞]=lt−1 Hence, N=6. In the above, the dimensions of the force Rare obtained from Newton’s second law, force =mass×acceleration; hence, [ R]=mlt−2. The dimensions of μ∞are obtained from its deﬁnition [e.g., μ=τ/(∂ u/∂y)], and from Newton’s second law. (Show for yourself that [μ ∞]=ml−1t−1.) Choose ρ∞,V∞, and cas the arbitrarily selected sets of Kphysical variables. Then Equation (1.27) can be reexpressed in terms of N−K=6−3=3 dimensionless /Pi1products in the form of Equation (1.25): f2(/Pi11,/Pi1 2,/Pi1 3)=0 (1.28) From Equation (1.26), these /Pi1products are /Pi11=f3(ρ∞,V∞,c,R) (1.29a) /Pi12=f4(ρ∞,V∞,c,μ∞) (1.29b) /Pi13=f5(ρ∞,V∞,c,a∞) (1.29c) For the time being, concentrate on /Pi11, from Equation (1.29 a). Assume that /Pi11=ρd ∞Vb ∞ceR (1.30) where d,b, and eare exponents to be found. In dimensional terms, Equa- tion (1.30) is [/Pi11]=(ml−3)d(lt−1)b(l)e(mlt−2) (1.31) Because /Pi11is dimensionless, the right side of Equation (1.31) must also be dimensionless. This means that the exponents of mmust add to zero, and similarly38 PART 1Fundamental Principles for the exponents of landt. Hence, Form: d+1=0 Forl: −3d+b+e+1=0 Fort: −b−2=0 Solving the above equations, we ﬁnd that d=− 1,b=− 2, and e=− 2. Substituting these values into Equation (1.30), we have /Pi11=Rρ−1 ∞V−2 ∞c−2 =R ρ∞V2 ∞c2(1.32) The quantity R/ρ∞V2 ∞c2is a dimensionless parameter in which c2has the di- mensions of an area. We can replace c2with any reference area we wish (such as the planform area of a wing S), and/Pi11will still be dimensionless. Moreover, we can multiply /Pi11by a pure number, and it will still be dimensionless. Thus, from Equation (1.32), /Pi11can be redeﬁned as /Pi11=R 1 2ρ∞V2 ∞S=R q∞S(1.33) Hence, /Pi11is a force coefﬁcient CR, as deﬁned in Section 1.5. In Equation (1.33), Sis a reference area germane to the given body shape. The remaining /Pi1products can be found as follows. From Equation (1.29b ), assume /Pi12=ρ∞Vh ∞ciμj ∞ (1.34) Paralleling the above analysis, we obtain [/Pi12]=(ml−3)(lt−1)h(l)i(ml−1t−1)j Hence, Form:1 +j=0 Forl: −3+h+i−j=0 Fort: −h−j=0 Thus, j=−1,h=1, and i=1. Substitution into Equation (1.34) gives /Pi12=ρ∞V∞c μ∞(1.35) The dimensionless combination in Equation (1.35) is deﬁned as the freestream Reynolds number Re=ρ∞V∞c/μ∞. The Reynolds number is physically a mea- sure of the ratio of inertia forces to viscous forces in a ﬂow and is one of themost powerful parameters in ﬂuid dynamics. Its importance is emphasized inChapters 15 to 20.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 39 Returning to Equation (1.29c ), assume /Pi13=V∞ρk ∞cras ∞ [/Pi13]=(lt−1)(ml−3)k(l)r(lt−1)s(1.36) Form: k=0 Forl:1 −3k+r+s=0 Fort: −1−s=0 Hence, k=0,s=−1, and r=0. Substituting Equation (1.36), we have /Pi1e=V∞ a∞(1.37) The dimensionless combination in Equation (1.37) is deﬁned as the freestream Mach number M =V∞/a∞. The Mach number is the ratio of the ﬂow velocity to the speed of sound; it is a powerful parameter in the study of gas dynamics. Itsimportance is emphasized in subsequent chapters. The results of our dimensional analysis may be organized as follows. Inserting Equations (1.33), (1.35), and (1.37) into (1.28), we have f 2/parenleftBigg R 1 2ρ∞V2 ∞S,ρ∞V∞c μ∞,V∞ a∞/parenrightBigg =0 or f2(CR,Re,M∞)=0 or CR=f6(Re, M∞) (1.38) This is an important result! Compare Equations (1.23) and (1.38). In Equa-tion (1.23), Ris expressed as a general function of ﬁve independent variables. However, our dimensional analysis has shown that: 1.Rcan be expressed in terms of a dimensionless force coefﬁcient, C R=R/1 2ρ∞V2 ∞S. 2.CRis a function of only Re and M∞, from Equation (1.38). Therefore, by using the Buckingham pi theorem, we have reduced the number of independent variables from ﬁve in Equation (1.23) to two in Equation (1.38).Now, if we wish to run a series of wind-tunnel tests for a given body at a givenangle of attack, we need only to vary the Reynolds and Mach numbers in order toobtain data for the direct formulation of Rthrough Equation (1.38). With a small amount of analysis, we have saved a huge amount of effort and wind-tunnel time.More importantly, we have deﬁned two dimensionless parameters, Re and M ∞, which govern the ﬂow. They are called similarity parameters, for reasons to be discussed in the following section. Other similarity parameters are introduced asour aerodynamic discussions progress.40 PART 1Fundamental Principles Since the lift and drag are components of the resultant force, corollaries to Equation (1.38) are CL=f7(Re, M∞) (1.39) CD=f8(Re, M∞) (1.40) Moreover, a relation similar to Equation (1.23) holds for the aerodynamic mo- ments, and dimensional analysis yields CM=f9(Re, M∞) (1.41) Keep in mind that the above analysis was for a given body shape at a given angleof attack α. Ifαis allowed to vary, then C L,CD, and CMwill in general depend on the value of α. Hence, Equations (1.39) to (1.41) can be generalized to CL=f10(Re, M∞,α) CD=f11(Re, M∞,α) CM=f12(Re, M∞,α)(1.42) (1.43)(1.44) Equations (1.42) to (1.44) assume a given body shape. Much of theoretical and experimental aerodynamics is focused on obtaining explicit expressions for Equa-tions (1.42) to (1.44) for speciﬁc body shapes. This is one of the practical ap-plications of aerodynamics mentioned in Section 1.2, and it is one of the majorthrusts of this book. For mechanical problems that also involve thermodynamics and heat transfer, the temperature, speciﬁc heat, and thermal conductivity of the ﬂuid, as well asthe temperature of the body surface (wall temperature), must be added to the listof physical variables, and the unit of temperature (say, kelvin or degree Rankine)must be added to the list of fundamental dimensions. For such cases, dimensionalanalysis yields additional dimensionless products such as heat transfer coefﬁ-cients, and additional similarity parameters such as the ratio of speciﬁc heat atconstant pressure to that at constant volume c p/cv, the ratio of wall tempera- ture to freestream temperature Tw/T∞, and the Prandtl number Pr =μ∞cp/k∞, where k∞is the thermal conductivity of the freestream.5Thermodynamics is essential to the study of compressible ﬂow (Chapters 7 to 14), and heat transferis part of the study of viscous ﬂow (Chapters 15 to 20). Hence, these additionalsimilarity parameters will be emphasized when they appear logically in our subse-quent discussions. For the time being, however, the Mach and Reynolds numberswill sufﬁce as the dominant similarity parameters for our present considerations. 5Thespeciﬁc heat of a ﬂuid is deﬁned as the amount of heat added to a system, δq, per unit increase in temperature; cv=δq/dT ifδqis added at constant volume, and similarly, for cpifδqis added at constant pressure. Speciﬁc heats are discussed in detail in Section 7.2. The thermal conductivity relates heat ﬂux to temperature gradients in the ﬂuid. For example, if ˙qxis the heat transferred in the xdirection per second per unit area and dT/dxis the temperature gradient in the xdirection, then thermal conductivity kis deﬁned by ˙qx=−k(dT/dx). Thermal conductivity is discussed in detail in Section 15.3.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 41 1.8 FLOW SIMILARITY Consider two different ﬂow ﬁelds over two different bodies. By deﬁnition, dif- ferent ﬂows are dynamically similar if: 1.The streamline patterns are geometrically similar. 2.The distributions of V/V∞,p/p∞,T/T∞, etc., throughout the ﬂow ﬁeld are the same when plotted against common nondimensionalcoordinates. 3.The force coefﬁcients are the same. Actually, item 3 is a consequence of item 2; if the nondimensional pressure andshear stress distributions over different bodies are the same, then the nondimen-sional force coefﬁcients will be the same. The deﬁnition of dynamic similarity was given above. Question: What are thecriteria to ensure that two ﬂows are dynamically similar? The answer comes from the results of the dimensional analysis in Section 1.7. Two ﬂows will bedynamically similar if: 1.The bodies and any other solid boundaries are geometrically similar for both ﬂows. 2.The similarity parameters are the same for both ﬂows. So far, we have emphasized two parameters, Re and M ∞. For many aerodynamic applications, these are by far the dominant similarity parameters. Therefore, in alimited sense, but applicable to many problems, we can say that ﬂows over geomet-rically similar bodies at the same Mach and Reynolds numbers are dynamicallysimilar, and hence the lift, drag, and moment coefﬁcients will be identical for thebodies. This is a key point in the validity of wind-tunnel testing. If a scale modelof a ﬂight vehicle is tested in a wind tunnel, the measured lift, drag, and momentcoefﬁcients will be the same as for free ﬂight as long as the Mach and Reynoldsnumbers of the wind-tunnel test-section ﬂow are the same as for the free-ﬂightcase. As we will see in subsequent chapters, this statement is not quite precisebecause there are other similarity parameters that inﬂuence the ﬂow. In addition,differences in freestream turbulence between the wind tunnel and free ﬂight canhave an important effect on C Dand the maximum value of CL. However, direct simulation of the free-ﬂight Re and M∞is the primary goal of many wind-tunnel tests. EXAMPLE 1.5 Consider the ﬂow over two circular cylinders, one having four times the diameter of the other, as shown in Figure 1.27. The ﬂow over the smaller cylinder has a freestreamdensity, velocity and temperature given by ρ 1,V1, and T1, respectively. The ﬂow over the larger cylinder has a freestream density, velocity, and temperature given by ρ2,V2, and T2, respectively, where ρ2=ρ1/4,V2=2V1, and T2=4T1. Assume that both μanda are proportional to T1/2. Show that the two ﬂows are dynamically similar.42 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 1.27 Example of dynamic ﬂow similarity. Note that as part of the deﬁnition of dynamic similarity, the streamlines (lines along which the ﬂow velocity is tangent at each point)are geometrically similar between the two ﬂows. ■Solution Sinceμ∝√ Tanda∝√ T, then μ2 μ1=/radicalbigg T2 T1=/radicalbigg 4T1 T1=2 anda2 a1=/radicalbigg T2 T1=2 By deﬁnition, M1=V1 a1 and M2=V2 a2=2V1 2a1=V1 a1=M1 Hence, the Mach numbers are the same. Basing the Reynolds number on the diameter d of the cylinder, we have by deﬁnition, Re1=ρ1V1d1 μ1 and Re2=ρ2V2d2 μ2=(ρ1/4)(2 V1)(4d 1) 2μ1=ρ1V1d1 μ1=Re1 Hence, the Reynolds numbers are the same. Since the two bodies are geometrically sim- ilar and M∞and Re are the same, we have satisﬁed all the criteria; the two ﬂows are dynamically similar. In turn, as a consequence of being similar ﬂows, we know from thedeﬁnition that: 1.The streamline patterns around the two cylinders are geometrically similar. 2.The nondimensional pressure, temperature, density, velocity, etc., distributions arethe same around two cylinders. This is shown schematically in Figure 1.28, whereCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 43 Figure 1.28 One aspect of the deﬁnition of dynamically similar ﬂows. The nondimensional ﬂow variable distributionsare the same. the nondimensional pressure distribution p/p∞is shown as a function of the nondimensional surface distance s/d. It is the same curve for both bodies. 3.The drag coefﬁcients for the two bodies are the same. Here, CD=D/q∞S, where S=πd2/4. As a result of the ﬂow similarity, CD1=CD2.(Note: Examining Figure 1.27, we see that the lift on the cylinders is zero because the ﬂow is symmetrical about the horizontal axis through the center of the cylinder. Thepressure distribution over the top is the same as over the bottom, and they canceleach other in the vertical direction. Therefore, drag is the only aerodynamic force onthe body.) EXAMPLE 1.6 Consider a Boeing 747 airliner cruising at a velocity of 550 mi/h at a standard altitudeof 38,000 ft, where the freestream pressure and temperature are 432.6 lb/ft 2and 390◦R, respectively. A one-ﬁftieth scale model of the 747 is tested in a wind tunnel where thetemperature is 430 ◦R. Calculate the required velocity and pressure of the test airstream in the wind tunnel such that the lift and drag coefﬁcients measured for the wind-tunnelmodel are the same as for free ﬂight. Assume that both μandaare proportional to T 1/2. ■Solution Let subscripts 1 and 2 denote the free-ﬂight and wind-tunnel conditions, respectively. For CL,1=CL,2andCD,1=CD,2, the wind-tunnel ﬂow must be dynamically similar to free ﬂight. For this to hold, M1=M2and Re 1=Re2: M1=V1 a1∝V1√T1 andM2=V2 a2∝V2√T244 PART 1Fundamental Principles Hence,V2√T2=V1√T1 orV2=V1/radicalbigg T2 T1=550/radicalbigg 430 390=577.5 mi/h Re1=ρ1V1c1 μ1∝ρ1V1c1√T1 and Re2=ρ2V2c2 μ2∝ρ2V2c2√T2 Hence,ρ1V1c1√T1=ρ2V2c2√T2 orρ2 ρ1=/parenleftbiggV1 V2/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggc1 c2/parenrightbigg/radicalbigg T2 T1 However, since M1=M2, then V1 V2=/radicalbigg T1 T2 Thus,ρ2 ρ1=c1 c2=50 The equation of state for a perfect gas is p=ρRT, where Ris the speciﬁc gas constant.

In Example 1.6, the wind-tunnel test stream must be pressurized far above atmospheric pressure in order to simulate the proper free-ﬂight Reynolds num- ber. However, most standard subsonic wind tunnels are not pressurized as such,because of the large extra ﬁnancial cost involved. This illustrates a common dif-ﬁculty in wind-tunnel testing, namely, the difﬁculty of simulating both Machnumber and Reynolds number simultaneously in the same tunnel. It is interest-ing to note that the NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, thepredecessor of NASA) in 1922 began operating a pressurized wind tunnel at theNACA Langley Memorial Laboratory in Hampton, Virginia. This was a subsonicwind tunnel contained entirely inside a large tank pressurized to as high as 20 atm.Called the variable density tunnel (VDT), this facility was used in the 1920s and1930s to provide essential data on the NACA family of airfoil sections at the highCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 45 Figure 1.29 The NACA variable density tunnel (VDT). Authorized in March of 1921, the VDT was operational in October 1922 at the NACA Langley Memorial Laboratory at Hampton, Virginia. It is essentially a large, subsonic wind tunnel entirely contained withinan 85-ton pressure shell, capable of 20 atm. This tunnel was instrumental in the developmentof the various families of NACA airfoil shapes in the 1920s and 1930s. In the early 1940s, itwas decommissioned as a wind tunnel and used as a high-pressure air storage tank. In 1983,due to its age and outdated riveted construction, its use was discontinued altogether. Today,the VDT remains at the NASA Langley Research Center; it has been ofﬁcially designated asa National Historic Landmark. (NASA). Reynolds numbers associated with free ﬂight. A photograph of the NACA vari- able density tunnel is shown in Figure 1.29; notice the heavy pressurized shell inwhich the wind tunnel is enclosed. A cross section of the VDT inside the pressurecell is shown in Figure 1.30. These ﬁgures demonstrate the extreme measuressometimes taken in order to simulate simultaneously the free-ﬂight values of theimportant similarity parameters in a wind tunnel. Today, for the most part, we donot attempt to simulate all the parameters simultaneously; rather, Mach numbersimulation is achieved in one wind tunnel, and Reynolds number simulation inanother tunnel. The results from both tunnels are then analyzed and correlated toobtain reasonable values for C LandCDappropriate for free ﬂight. In any event, this example serves to illustrate the difﬁculty of full free-ﬂight simulation in agiven wind tunnel and underscores the importance given to dynamically similarﬂows in experimental aerodynamics.46 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 1.30 Schematic of the variable density tunnel (From Baals, D. D. and Carliss, W. R., Wind Tunnels of NASA, NASA SP-440, 1981). DESIGN BOX Lift and drag coefﬁcients play a strong role in the preliminary design and performance analysis of air-planes. The purpose of this design box is to enforce theimportance of C LandCDin aeronautical engineering; they are much more than just the conveniently deﬁnedterms discussed so far—they are fundamental quan-tities, which make the difference between intelligentengineering and simply groping in the dark. Consider an airplane in steady, level (horizontal) ﬂight, as illustrated in Figure 1.31. For this case, theweight Wacts vertically downward. The lift Lacts vertically upward, perpendicular to the relative wind TL WV/H11009 D Figure 1.31 The four forces acting on an airplane in ﬂight.V∞(by deﬁnition). In order to sustain the airplane in level ﬂight, L=W The thrust Tfrom the propulsive mechanism and the drag Dare both parallel to V∞. For steady (unaccel- erated) ﬂight, T=D Note that for most conventional ﬂight situations, themagnitude of LandWis much larger than the mag- nitude of TandD, as indicated by the sketch in Fig- ure 1.31. Typically, for conventional cruising ﬂight, L/D≈15 to 20. For an airplane of given shape, such as that sketched in Figure 1.31, at given Mach and Reynoldsnumber, C LandCDare simply functions of the angle of attack, αof the airplane. This is the message con- veyed by Equations (1.42) and (1.43). It is a simpleand basic message—part of the beauty of nature—that the actual values of C LandCDfor a given body shape just depend on the orientation of the body in theﬂow (i.e., angle of attack). Generic variations for C L andCDversus αare sketched in Figure 1.32. Note that CLincreases linearly with αuntil an angle ofCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 47 CL, max CL CD, minCD Angle of attack, /H9251 Figure 1.32 Schematic of lift and drag coefﬁcients versus angle of attack; illustration of maximum lift coefﬁcient and minimum dragcoefﬁcient. attack is reached when the wing stalls, the lift coefﬁ- cient reaches a peak value, and then drops off as αis further increased. The maximum value of the lift coef-ﬁcient is denoted by C L,max, as noted in Figure 1.32. The lowest possible velocity at which the air- plane can maintain steady level ﬂight is the stallingvelocity, V stall; it is dictated by the value of CL,max, as follows.6From the deﬁnition of lift coefﬁcient given in Section 1.5, applied for the case of level ﬂight where L=W, we have CL=L q∞S=W q∞S=2W ρ∞V2∞S(1.45) Solving Equation (1.45) for V∞, V∞=/radicalbigg 2W ρ∞SCL(1.46) For a given airplane ﬂying at a given altitude, W,ρ, andSare ﬁxed values; hence from Equation (1.46) each value of velocity corresponds to a speciﬁc valueofCL. In particular, V∞will be the smallest when CLis a maximum. Hence, the stalling velocity for a given airplane is determined by CL,max from Equa- tion (1.46) Vstall=/radicalBigg 2W ρ∞SCL,max(1.47) For a given airplane, without the aid of any arti- ﬁcial devices, CL,maxis determined purely by nature, through the physical laws for the aerodynamic ﬂow-ﬁeld over the airplane. However, the airplane designerhas some devices available that artiﬁcially increase C L,maxbeyond that for the basic airplane shape. These mechanical devices are called high-lift devices; exam- ples are ﬂaps, slats, and slots on the wing which, whendeployed by the pilot, serve to increase C L,max, and hence decrease the stalling speed. High-lift devicesare usually deployed for landing and take-off; theyare discussed in more detail in Section 4.12. On the other extreme of ﬂight velocity, the maxi- mum velocity for a given airplane with a given maxi-mum thrust from the engine is determined by the valueof minimum drag coefﬁcient, C D,min, where CD,minis marked in Figure 1.32. From the deﬁnition of drag co-efﬁcient in Section 1.5, applied for the case of steadylevel ﬂight where T=D, we have C D=D q∞S=T q∞S=2T ρ∞V2∞S(1.48) Solving Equation (1.48) for V∞, V∞=/radicalbigg 2T ρ∞SCD(1.49) For a given airplane ﬂying at maximum thrust Tmax and a given altitude, from Equation (1.49) the maxi-mum value of V ∞corresponds to ﬂight at CD,min Vmax=/radicalBigg 2Tmax ρ∞SCD,min(1.50) From the above discussion, it is clear that the aerodynamic coefﬁcients are important engineering 6The lowest velocity may instead be dictated by the power required to maintain level ﬂight exceeding the power available from the powerplant. This occurs on the “back side of the power curve.” The velocity at which this occurs is usually less than the stalling velocity, so is of academic interest only. See Anderson,Aircraft Performance and Design, McGraw-Hill, 1999, for more details.48 PART 1Fundamental Principles Flight velocity, V/H11009Lift coefficient, CL VstallCL, max Vmax /H9251 Decreasing Figure 1.33 Schematic of the variation of lift coefﬁcient with ﬂight velocity for level ﬂight. quantities that dictate the performance and design of airplanes. For example, stalling velocity is determinedin part by C L,max, and maximum velocity is deter- mined in part by CD,min. Broadening our discussion to the whole range of ﬂight velocity for a given airplane, note from Equa-tion (1.45) that each value of V ∞corresponds to a speciﬁc value of CL. Therefore, over the whole range of ﬂight velocity from VstalltoVmax, the airplane lift coefﬁcient varies as shown generically in Figure 1.33.The values of C Lgiven by the curve in Figure 1.33 are what are needed to maintain level ﬂight over the whole range of velocity at a given altitude. The airplane de-signer must design the airplane to achieve these val- ues of C Lfor an airplane of given weight and wing area. Note that the required values of CLdecrease as V∞increases. Examining the lift coefﬁcient variation with angle of attack shown in Figure 1.33, note thatas the airplane ﬂies faster, the angle of attack must besmaller, as also shown in Figure 1.33. Hence, at highspeeds, airplanes are at low α, and at low speeds, air- planes are at high α; the speciﬁc angle of attack which the airplane must have at a speciﬁc V ∞is dictated by the speciﬁc value of CLrequired at that velocity. Obtaining raw lift on a body is relatively easy— even a barn door creates lift at angle of attack. Thename of the game is to obtain the necessary lift withaslowa drag as possible. That is, the values of C L required over the entire ﬂight range for an airplane,as represented by Figure 1.33, can sometimes be ob-tained even for the least effective lifting shape—justmake the angle of attack high enough. But C Dalso varies with V∞, as governed by Equation (1.48); the generic variation of CDwith V∞is sketched in Fig- ure 1.34. A poor aerodynamic shape, even though itgenerates the necessary values of C Lshown in Fig- ure 1.33, will have inordinately high values of CD (i.e., the CDcurve in Figure 1.34 will ride high on theCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 49 Flight velocity, V/H11009Drag coefficient, CD VstallCD, min VmaxVmax /H9251 DecreasingLow drag aerodynamic shapeHigh dragaerodynamic shape Figure 1.34 Schematic of the variation of drag coefﬁcient with ﬂight velocity for level ﬂight. Comparison between high and low drag aerodynamic bodies, with the consequent effect on maximum velocity. graph), as denoted by the dashed curve in Figure 1.34. An aerodynamically efﬁcient shape, however, willproduce the requisite values of C Lprescribed by Fig- ure 1.33 with much lower drag, as denoted by the solidcurve in Figure 1.34. An undesirable by-product of thehigh-drag shape is a lower value of the maximum ve-locity for the same maximum thrust, as also indicatedin Figure 1.34. Finally, we emphasize that a true measure of the aerodynamic efﬁciency of a body shape is its lift-to- drag ratio, given by L D=q∞SCL q∞SCD=CL CD(1.51) Since the value of CLnecessary for ﬂight at a given velocity and altitude is determined by the airplane’sweight and wing area (actually, by the ratio ofW/S, called the wing loading) through the relationship given by Equation (1.45), the value of L/Dat this veloc- ity is controlled by CD, the denominator in Equa- tion (1.51). At any given velocity, we want L/Dto be as high as possible; the higher is L/D, the more aero- dynamically efﬁcient is the body. For a given airplaneat a given altitude, the variation of L/Das a func- tion of velocity is sketched generically in Figure 1.35.Note that, as V ∞increases from a low value, L/D ﬁrst increases, reaches a maximum at some interme-diate velocity, and then decreases. Note that, as V ∞ increases, the angle of attack of the airplane decreases,as explained earlier. From a strictly aerodynamic con-sideration, L/Dfor a given body shape depends on angle of attack. This can be seen from Figure 1.32,50 PART 1Fundamental Principles Flight velocity, V/H11009V/H11009 for (L /D)max(L/D)maxL/D = CL/CD Figure 1.35 Schematic of the variation of lift-to-drag ratio with ﬂight velocity for level ﬂight.

If these two curves are ratioed, the result is L/Das a func- tion of angle of attack, as sketched generically in Fig- ure 1.36. The relationship of Figure 1.35 to Figure 1.36is that, when the airplane is ﬂying at the velocity thatcorresponds to (L/D) maxas shown in Figure 1.35, itisat the angle of attack for (L/D)maxas shown in Figure 1.36. In summary, the purpose of this design box is to emphasize the important role played by theaerodynamic coefﬁcients in the performance analysis and design of airplanes. In this discussion, what hasCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 51 been important is not the lift and drag per se, but rather CLand CD. These coefﬁcients are a won- derful intellectual construct that helps us to bet-ter understand the aerodynamic characteristics of abody, and to make reasoned, intelligent calculations.Hence they are more than just conveniently deﬁnedquantities as might ﬁrst appear when introduced inSection 1.5. For more insight to the engineering value of these coefﬁcients, see Anderson, Aircraft Performance and Design, McGraw-Hill, 1999, and Anderson, Introduc-tion to Flight, 6th edition, McGraw-Hill, 2008. Also, homework Problem 1.15 at the end of this chaptergives you the opportunity to construct speciﬁc curvesforC L,CD, and L/Dversus velocity for an actual airplane so that you can obtain a feel for some realnumbers that have been only generically indicated inthe ﬁgures here. (In our present discussion, the useof generic ﬁgures has been intentional for pedagogicreasons.) Finally, an historical note on the originsof the use of aerodynamic coefﬁcients is given inSection 1.14. EXAMPLE 1.7 Consider an executive jet transport patterned after the Cessna 560 Citation V shown in three-view in Figure 1.37. The airplane is cruising at a velocity of 492 mph at analtitude of 33,000 ft, where the ambient air density is 7.9656 ×10 −4slug/ft3. The weight and wing planform areas of the airplane are 15,000 lb and 342.6 ft2, respectively. The drag coefﬁcient at cruise is 0.015. Calculate the lift coefﬁcient and the lift-to-drag ratioat cruise. ■Solution The units of miles per hour for velocity are not consistent units. In the English engineeringsystem of units, feet per second are consistent units for velocity (see Section 2.4 of Refer-ence 2). To convert between mph and ft/s, it is useful to remember that 88 ft/s =60 mph. Figure 1.37 Cessna 560 Citation V .52 PART 1Fundamental Principles For the present example, V∞=492/parenleftbig88 60/parenrightbig =721.6 ft/s From Equation (1.45), CL=2W ρ∞V2∞S=2(15,000) (7.9659 ×10−4)(721.6)2(342.6)=0.21 From Equation (1.51), L D=CL CD=0.21 0.015=14 Remarks: For a conventional airplane such as shown in Figure 1.37, almost all the lift at cruising conditions is produced by the wing; the lift of the fuselage and tail are very small by comparison. Hence, the wing can be viewed as an aerodynamic “lever.” In thisexample, the lift-to-drag ratio is 14, which means that for the expenditure of one poundof thrust to overcome one pound of drag, the wing is lifting 14 pounds of weight—quitea nice leverage. EXAMPLE 1.8 The same airplane as described in Example 1.7 has a stalling speed at sea level of 100 mphat the maximum take-off weight of 15,900 lb. The ambient air density at standard sealevel is 0.002377 slug/ft Calculate the value of the maximum lift coefﬁcient for the airplane. ■Solution Once again we have to use consistent units, so Vstall=10088 60=146.7 ft/s Solving Equation (1.47) for CL,max, we have CL,max=2W ρ∞V2 stallS=2(15,900) (0.002377)(146.7)2(342.6)=1.81 1.9 FLUID STATICS: BUOYANCY FORCE In aerodynamics, we are concerned about ﬂuids in motion, and the resulting forces and moments on bodies due to such motion. However, in this section, we considerthe special case of noﬂuid motion (i.e., ﬂuid statics). A body immersed in a ﬂuid will still experience a force even if there is no relative motion between the bodyand the ﬂuid. Let us see why. To begin, we must ﬁrst consider the force on an element of ﬂuid itself. Consider a stagnant ﬂuid above the xzplane, as shown in Figure 1.38. The verti- cal direction is given by y. Consider an inﬁnitesimally small ﬂuid element with sides of length dx,dy, and dz. There are two types of forces acting on this ﬂuid element: pressure forces from the surrounding ﬂuid exerted on the surface of theCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 53 Figure 1.38 Forces on a ﬂuid element in a stagnant ﬂuid. element, and the gravity force due to the weight of the ﬂuid inside the element. Consider forces in the ydirection. The pressure on the bottom surface of the element is p, and hence the force on the bottom face is p(dx dz )in the upward direction, as shown in Figure 1.38. The pressure on the top surface of the elementwill be slightly different from the pressure on the bottom because the top surfaceis at a different location in the ﬂuid. Let dp/dydenote the rate of change of pwith respect to y. Then the pressure exerted on the top surface will be p+(dp/dy)dy, and the pressure force on the top of the element will be [ p+(dp/dy)dy](dx dz ) in the downward direction, as shown in Figure 1.38. Hence, letting upward forcebe positive, we have Net pressure force =p(dx dz )− /parenleftbigg p+dp dydy/parenrightbigg (dx dz ) =−dp dy(dx dydz ) Letρbe the mean density of the ﬂuid element. The total mass of the element is ρ(dx dydz ). Therefore, Gravity force =−ρ(dx dydz )g where gis the acceleration of gravity. Since the ﬂuid element is stationary (in equilibrium), the sum of the forces exerted on it must be zero: −dp dy(dx dydz )−gρ(dx dydz )=0 or dp=−gρdy (1.52) Equation (1.52) is called the Hydrostatic equation; it is a differential equation which relates the change in pressure dpin a ﬂuid with a change in vertical height dy.54 PART 1Fundamental Principles The net force on the element acts only in the vertical direction. The pressure forces on the front and back faces are equal and opposite and hence cancel; the same is true for the left and right faces. Also, the pressure forces shown inFigure 1.38 act at the center of the top and bottom faces, and the center of gravityis at the center of the elemental volume (assuming the ﬂuid is homogeneous);hence, the forces in Figure 1.38 are colinear, and as a result, there is no momenton the element. Equation (1.52) governs the variation of atmospheric properties as a func- tion of altitude in the air above us. It is also used to estimate the properties ofother planetary atmospheres such as for Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. The use ofEquation (1.52) in the analysis and calculation of the “standard atmosphere” isgiven in detail in Reference 2; hence the details will not be repeated here. Appen-dices D and E, however, contain a tabulation of the properties of the 1959 ARDCmodel atmosphere for earth as compiled by the U.S. Air Force. These standardatmosphere tables are included in this book for use in solving certain worked ex-amples and some end-of-chapter homework problems. Moreover, Example 1.10at the end of this section illustrates how the Hydrostatic equation is used to obtainsome of the entries in Appendices D and E. Let the ﬂuid be a liquid, for which we can assume ρis constant. Consider points 1 and 2 separated by the vertical distance /Delta1has sketched on the right side of Figure 1.38. The pressure and ylocations at these points are p 1,h1, and p2, h2, respectively. Integrating Equation (1.52) between points 1 and 2, we have /integraldisplayp2 p1dp=−ρg/integraldisplayh2 h1dy or p2−p1=−ρg(h2−h1)=ρg/Delta1h (1.53) where /Delta1h=h1−h2. Equation (1.53) can be more conveniently expressed as p2+ρgh2=p1+ρgh1 or p+ρgh=constant (1.54) Note that in Equations (1.53) and (1.54), increasing values of hare in the positive (upward) ydirection. A simple application of Equation (1.54) is the calculation of the pressure distribution on the walls of a container holding a liquid, and open to the atmosphereat the top. This is illustrated in Figure 1.39, where the top of the liquid is at aheight h The atmospheric pressure pais impressed on the top of the liquid; hence, the pressure at h1is simply pa. Applying Equation (1.54) between the top (where h=h1) and an arbitrary height h, we have p+ρgh=p1+ρgh1=pa+ρgh1 or p=pa+ρg(h1−h) (1.55)CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 55 Figure 1.39 Hydrostatic pressure distribution on the walls of a container. Equation (1.55) gives the pressure distribution on the vertical sidewall of the container as a function of h. Note that the pressure is a linear function of has sketched on the right of Figure 1.39, and that pincreases with depth below the surface. Another simple and very common application of Equation (1.54) is the liquid- ﬁlled U-tube manometer used for measuring pressure differences, as sketched in Figure 1.40. The manometer is usually made from hollow glass tubing bent in theshape of the letter U. Imagine that we have an aerodynamic body immersed in an airﬂow (such as in a wind tunnel), and we wish to use a manometer to measurethe surface pressure at point bon the body. A small pressure oriﬁce (hole) at point bis connected to one side of the manometer via a long (usually ﬂexible) pressure tube. The other side of the manometer is open to the atmosphere, wherethe pressure p ais a known value. The U tube is partially ﬁlled with a liquid of known density ρ. The tops of the liquid on the left and right sides of the U tube are at points 1 and 2, with heights h1andh2, respectively. The body surface pressure pbis transmitted through the pressure tube and impressed on the top of the liquid at point 1. The atmospheric pressure pais impressed on the top of the liquid at point 2. Because in general pb/negationslash=pa, the tops of the liquid will be at different heights (i.e., the two sides of the manometer will show a displacement/Delta1h=h 1−h2of the ﬂuid).

From Equation (1.54) applied between points 1 and 2, pb+ρgh1=pa+ρgh2 or pb=pa−ρg(h1−h2) or pb=pa−ρg/Delta1h (1.56) In Equation (1.56), pa,ρ, and gare known, and /Delta1his read from the U tube, thus allowing pbto be measured. At the beginning of this section, we stated that a solid body immersed in a ﬂuid will experience a force even if there is no relative motion between the body and the ﬂuid. We are now in a position to derive an expression for this force, henceforthcalled the buoyancy force. We will consider a body immersed in either a stagnant gas or liquid, hence ρcan be a variable. For simplicity, consider a rectangular body of unit width, length l, and height (h 1−h2), as shown in Figure 1.41. Examining Figure 1.41, we see that the vertical force Fon the body due to the pressure distribution over the surface is F=(p2−p1)l(1) (1.57) There is no horizontal force because the pressure distributions over the verticalfaces of the rectangular body lead to equal and opposite forces which cancel eachother. In Equation (1.57), an expression for p 2−p1can be obtained by integrating the hydrostatic equation, Equation (1.52), between the top and bottom faces: p2−p1=/integraldisplayp2 p1dp=−/integraldisplayh2 h1ρgdy=/integraldisplayh1 h2ρgdy Substituting this result into Equation (1.57), we obtain for the buoyancy force F=l(1)/integraldisplayh1 h2ρgdy (1.58) Solid or hollow bodyElement of fluid ll llp1 p2h1 h2h1 dy h2y x z Figure 1.41 Source of the buoyancy force on a body immersed in a ﬂuid.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 57 Consider the physical meaning of the integral in Equation (1.58). The weight of a small element of ﬂuid of height dyand width and length of unity as shown at the right of Figure 1.41 is ρgdy (1)(1). In turn, the weight of a column of ﬂuid with a base of unit area and a height (h1−h2)is /integraldisplayh1 h2ρgdy which is precisely the integral in Equation (1.58). Moreover, if we place lof these ﬂuid columns side by side, we would have a volume of ﬂuid equal to the volumeof the body on the left of Figure 1.41, and the weight of this total volume of ﬂuid would be l/integraldisplayh1 h2ρgdy which is precisely the right-hand side of Equation (1.58). Therefore, Equa-tion (1.58) states in words that Buoyancy force on body=weight of ﬂuid displaced by body We have just proved the well-known Archimedes principle, ﬁrst advanced by the Greek scientist, Archimedes of Syracuse (287–212 B.C.). Although we have used a rectangular body to simplify our derivation, the Archimedes principle holds forbodies of any general shape. (See Problem 1.14 at the end of this chapter.) Also,note from our derivation that the Archimedes principle holds for both gases andliquids and does not require that the density be constant. The density of liquids is usually several orders of magnitude larger than the density of gases (e.g., for water ρ=10 3kg/m3, whereas for air ρ=1.23 kg/m3). Therefore, a given body will experience a buoyancy force a thousand times greaterin water than in air. Obviously, for naval vehicles buoyancy force is all important,whereas for airplanes it is negligible. On the other hand, lighter-than-air vehicles,such as blimps and hot-air balloons, rely on buoyancy force for sustenation; theyobtain sufﬁcient buoyancy force simply by displacing huge volumes of air. Formost problems in aerodynamics, however, buoyancy force is so small that it canbe readily neglected. EXAMPLE 1.9 A hot-air balloon with an inﬂated diameter of 30 ft is carrying a weight of 800 lb, which includes the weight of the hot air inside the balloon. Calculate (a)its upward acceler- ation at sea level the instant the restraining ropes are released and (b)the maximum altitude it can achieve. Assume that the variation of density in the standard atmosphereis given by ρ=0.002377(1 −7×10 −6h)4.21, where his the altitude in feet and ρis in slug/ft3.58 PART 1Fundamental Principles ■Solution (a)At sea level, where h=0,ρ=0.002377 slug/ft3.

A complete discussion onthe construction and use of the standard altitude tables is given in Chapter 3 of Reference 2. From sea level to an altitude of 11 km, the standard altitude is based on a linear variation of temperature with altitude, h, where Tdecreases at a rate of −6.5 K per kilometer (the lapse rate). At sea level, the standard pressure, density, and temperature are1.01325 ×10 5N/m2, 1.2250 kg/m3, and 288.16 K, respectively. Calculate the pressure, density, and temperature at a standard altitude of 5 km. ■Solution Repeating Equation (1.52), dp=−gρdy=−gρdhCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 59 The equation of state for a perfect gas is given in Chapter 7 as Equation (7.1), p=ρRT where Ris the speciﬁc gas constant. Dividing Equation (1.52) by (7.1), we have dp p=−g Rdh T(E1.1) Denoting the lapse rate by a, we have by deﬁnition a≡dT dh or dh=dT a(E1.2) Substituting (E1.2) into (E1.1), we obtain dp p=−g aRdT T(E1.3) Integrate Equation (E1.3) from sea level where the standard values of pressure and tem- perature are denoted by psandTs, respectively, and a given altitude hwhere the values of pressure and temperature are pandT, respectively. /integraldisplayp psdp p=−/integraldisplayT Tsg aRdT T or lnP ps=−/integraldisplayT Tsg aRdT T(E1.4) In Equation (E1.4), aandRare constants, but the acceleration of gravity, g, varies with altitude. The integral in Equation (E1.4) is simpliﬁed by assuming that gis constant with altitude, equal to its value at sea level, gs. With this assumption, Equation (E1.4) becomes lnP ps=−gs aRlnT Ts or p ps=/parenleftbiggT Ts/parenrightbigg−gs/aR (E1.5) Note: Here we must make a distinction between the geometric altitude, hG, which is the actual “tape measure” altitude above sea level, and the geopotential altitude, h, which is a slightly ﬁctitious altitude consistent with the assumption of a constant value of g. That is, when we write the Hydrostatic equation as dp=−gρdhG we are treating gas a variable with altitude and hence the altitude is the actual geometric altitude, hG. On the other hand, when we assume that gis constant, say equal to its value60 PART 1Fundamental Principles at sea level, gs, the Hydrostatic equation is p=−gsρdh (E1.6) where his denoted as the geopotential altitude, consistent with the assumption of constant g. For reasonable altitudes associated with conventional atmospheric ﬂight, the difference between hGandhis very small. Observe from Appendix D that altitude is listed under two columns, the ﬁrst being the geometric altitude, hG, and the second being the geopotential altitude, h. For the current example we are calculating the properties at an altitude of 5 km. This is the real “tape measure” altitude, hG. The corresponding value of geopotential altitude, h, is 4.996 km, only a 0.08 percent difference. The calculation of hfor a given hG is derived in Reference 2; it is not important to our discussions here. What is important, however, is that when we use Equation (E1.5), or any other such equation assuming aconstant value of g, we must use the geopotential altitude. For the calculations in this example, where we are calculating properties at a geometric altitude of 5 km, we mustuse the value of the geopotential altitude, 4.996 km, in the equations. Equation (E1.5) explicitly gives the variation of pressure with temperature, and im- plicitly the variation with altitude because temperature is a known function of altitude viathe given lapse rate a=dT/dh=− 6.5 K/km. Speciﬁcally, because Tvaries linearly with altitude for the altitude region under consideration here, we have T−T s=ah (E1.7) In Equation (E1.7), his the geopotential altitude. The given value of a=−6.5 K/km = −0.0065 /m is based on the change in geopotential altitude. Thus, from Equation (E1.7), we have at the speciﬁed geometric altitude of 5 km, T−288.16 =−(0.0065)(4996) =−32.474 T=288.16 −32.474 =255.69 K Note that this value of Tis precisely the value entered in Appendix D for a geometric altitude of 5000 m. In Equation (E1.5), for air, R=287 J/kg K. Thus, the exponent is −gs aR=−(9.80) (−0.0065)(287)=5.25328 and p ps=/parenleftbiggT Ts/parenrightbigg−gs/aR =/parenleftbigg255.69 288.16/parenrightbigg5.25328 =0.53364 p=0.53364 ps=0.53364(1.01325 ×105) p=5.407×104N/m2 This value of pressure agrees within 0.04 percent with the value entered in Appendix D.The very slight difference is due to the value of R=287 J/(kg)(K) used here, whichCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 61 depends on the molecular weight of air, which in turn varies slightly from one source to another. Finally, the density can be obtained from the equation of state ρ=p RT=5.407×104 (287)(255.69)=0.7368 kg/m3 which agrees within 0.05 percent with the value entered in Appendix D. EXAMPLE 1.11 Consider a U-tube mercury manometer oriented vertically. One end is completely sealedwith a total vacuum above the column of mercury. The other end is open to the atmospherewhere the atmospheric pressure is that for standard sea level. What is the displacementheight of the mercury in centimeters, and in which end is the mercury column the highest?The density of mercury is 1.36 ×10 4kg/m3. ■Solution Examining Figure 1.40, consider the sealed end with the total vacuum to be on the left,where p b=0, and the height of the mercury column is h1. This is balanced by the right column of mercury with height h2plus the atmospheric pressure paexerted on the top of the column. Clearly, when these two columns of mercury are balanced, the left columnmust be higher to account for the ﬁnite pressure being exerted at the top of the rightcolumn, i.e., h 1>h2. From Equation (1.56), we have pb=pa−ρg/Delta1h where /Delta1h=h1−h2 Thus, /Delta1h=pa ρg From Appendix D, at sea level pa=1.013 ×105N/m2. Hence, /Delta1h=pa ρg=1.013×105 /parenleftbig 1.36×104/parenrightbig (9.8)=0.76 m =76 cm Note: Since 2.54 cm =1 in, then /Delta1h=76/2.54 =29.92 in. The above calculation explains why, on a day when the atmospheric pressure happens to be that for standard sealevel, the meteorologist on television will usually say that the pressure is now “76 cm, or760 mm, or 29.92 in.” You rarely hear the pressure quoted in terms of “pounds per squarefoot,” or “pounds per square inch,” and hardly ever in “newtons per square meter.”62 PART 1Fundamental Principles 1.10 TYPES OF FLOW An understanding of aerodynamics, like that of any other physical science, is ob- tained through a “building-block” approach—we dissect the discipline, form theparts into nice polished blocks of knowledge, and then later attempt to reassemblethe blocks to form an understanding of the whole. An example of this process isthe way that different types of aerodynamic ﬂows are categorized and visualized.Although nature has no trouble setting up the most detailed and complex ﬂowwith a whole spectrum of interacting physical phenomena, we must attempt tounderstand such ﬂows by modeling them with less detail, and neglecting some ofthe (hopefully) less signiﬁcant phenomena. As a result, a study of aerodynamicshas evolved into a study of numerous and distinct types of ﬂow. The purpose ofthis section is to itemize and contrast these types of ﬂow, and to brieﬂy describetheir most important physical phenomena. 1.10.1 Continuum Versus Free Molecule Flow Consider the ﬂow over a body, say, for example, a circular cylinder of diameter d. Also, consider the ﬂuid to consist of individual molecules, which are moving aboutin random motion. The mean distance that a molecule travels between collisionswith neighboring molecules is deﬁned as the mean-free path λ. Ifλis orders of magnitude smaller than the scale of the body measured by d, then the ﬂow appears to the body as a continuous substance. The molecules impact the bodysurface so frequently that the body cannot distinguish the individual molecularcollisions, and the surface feels the ﬂuid as a continuous medium. Such ﬂow iscalled continuum ﬂow. The other extreme is where λis on the same order as the body scale; here the gas molecules are spaced so far apart (relative to d) that collisions with the body surface occur only infrequently, and the body surface canfeel distinctly each molecular impact. Such ﬂow is called free molecular ﬂow. For manned ﬂight, vehicles such as the space shuttle encounter free molecular ﬂow atthe extreme outer edge of the atmosphere, where the air density is so low that λ becomes on the order of the shuttle size. There are intermediate cases, where ﬂowscan exhibit some characteristics of both continuum and free molecule ﬂows; suchﬂows are generally labeled “low-density ﬂows” in contrast to continuum ﬂow. Byfar, the vast majority of practical aerodynamic applications involve continuumﬂows. Low-density and free molecule ﬂows are just a small part of the totalspectrum of aerodynamics. Therefore, in this book we will always deal withcontinuum ﬂow; that is, we will always treat the ﬂuid as a continuous medium. 1.10.2 Inviscid Versus Viscous Flow A major facet of a gas or liquid is the ability of the molecules to move rather freely,as explained in Section 1.2. When the molecules move, even in a very randomfashion, they obviously transport their mass, momentum, and energy from onelocation to another in the ﬂuid. This transport on a molecular scale gives rise tothe phenomena of mass diffusion, viscosity (friction), and thermal conduction.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 63 Flow outside the boundary layer is inviscid Thin boundary layer ofviscous flow adjacentto surface Body surface Figure 1.42 The division of a ﬂow into two regions: (1) the thin viscous boundary layer adjacent to the body surface and (2) the inviscid ﬂow outside the boundary layer. Such “transport phenomena” will be discussed in detail in Chapter 15. For our purposes here, we need only to recognize that all real ﬂows exhibit the effectsof these transport phenomena; such ﬂows are called viscous ﬂows. In contrast, a ﬂow that is assumed to involve no friction, thermal conduction, or diffusion iscalled an inviscid ﬂow. Inviscid ﬂows do not truly exist in nature; however, there are many practical aerodynamic ﬂows (more than you would think) where theinﬂuence of transport phenomena is small, and we can model the ﬂow as being inviscid. For this reason, more than 70 percent of this book (Chapters 3 to 14)deals primarily with inviscid ﬂows. Theoretically, inviscid ﬂow is approached in the limit as the Reynolds number goes to inﬁnity (to be proved in Chapter 15). However, for practical problems,many ﬂows with high but ﬁnite Re can be assumed to be inviscid. For suchﬂows, the inﬂuence of friction, thermal conduction, and diffusion is limited to avery thin region adjacent to the body surface called the boundary layer, and theremainder of the ﬂow outside this thin region is essentially inviscid. This divisionof the ﬂow into two regions is illustrated in Figure 1.42. Hence, most of thematerial discussed in Chapters 3 to 14 applies to the ﬂow outside the boundarylayer. For ﬂows over slender bodies, such as the airfoil sketched in Figure 1.42,inviscid theory adequately predicts the pressure distribution and lift on the bodyand gives a valid representation of the streamlines and ﬂow ﬁeld away from thebody. However, because friction (shear stress) is a major source of aerodynamicdrag, inviscid theories by themselves cannot adequately predict total drag. In contrast, there are some ﬂows that are dominated by viscous effects. For example, if the airfoil in Figure 1.42 is inclined to a high incidence angle to the ﬂow(high angle of attack), then the boundary layer will tend to separate from the topsurface, and a large wake is formed downstream. The separated ﬂow is sketchedat the top of Figure 1.43; it is characteristic of the ﬂow ﬁeld over a “stalled”airfoil. Separated ﬂow also dominates the aerodynamics of blunt bodies, suchas the cylinder at the bottom of Figure 1.43. Here, the ﬂow expands around thefront face of the cylinder, but separates from the surface on the rear face, forminga rather fat wake downstream. The types of ﬂow illustrated in Figure 1.43 aredominated by viscous effects; no inviscid theory can independently predict the64 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 1.43 Examples of viscous-dominated ﬂow. aerodynamics of such ﬂows. They require the inclusion of viscous effects, to be presented in Part 4. 1.10.3 Incompressible Versus Compressible Flows A ﬂow in which the density ρis constant is called incompressible. In contrast, a ﬂow where the density is variable is called compressible. A more precise deﬁni- tion of compressibility will be given in Chapter 7. For our purposes here, we willsimply note that all ﬂows, to a greater or lesser extent, are compressible; trulyincompressible ﬂow, where the density is precisely constant, does not occur innature. However, analogous to our discussion of inviscid ﬂow, there are a numberof aerodynamic problems that can be modeled as being incompressible withoutany detrimental loss of accuracy. For example, the ﬂow of homogeneous liquidsis treated as incompressible, and hence most problems involving hydrodynamicsassume ρ=constant. Also, the ﬂow of gases at a low Mach number is essen- tially incompressible; for M<0.3, it is always safe to assume ρ=constant. (We will prove this in Chapter 8.) This was the ﬂight regime of all airplanes from theWright brothers’ ﬁrst ﬂight in 1903 to just prior to World War II. It is still theﬂight regime of most small, general aviation aircraft of today. Hence, there existsa large bulk of aerodynamic experimental and theoretical data for incompressibleﬂows. Such ﬂows are the subject of Chapters 3 to 6. On the other hand, high-speedﬂow (near Mach 1 and above) must be treated as compressible; for such ﬂows ρ can vary over wide latitudes. Compressible ﬂow is the subject of Chapters 7 to 14. 1.10.4 Mach Number Regimes Of all the ways of subdividing and describing different aerodynamic ﬂows, thedistinction based on the Mach number is probably the most prevalent. If Mis theCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 65 local Mach number at an arbitrary point in a ﬂow ﬁeld, then by deﬁnition the ﬂow is locally: Subsonic ifM<1 Sonic ifM=1 Supersonic ifM>1 Looking at the whole ﬁeld simultaneously, four different speed regimes can beidentiﬁed using Mach number as the criterion: 1.Subsonic ﬂow (M<1 everywhere). A ﬂow ﬁeld is deﬁned as subsonic if the Mach number is less than 1 at every point. Subsonic ﬂows are characterized by smooth streamlines (no discontinuity in slope), as sketchedin Figure 1.44 a. Moreover, since the ﬂow velocity is everywhere less than the speed of sound, disturbances in the ﬂow (say, the sudden deﬂection ofthe trailing edge of the airfoil in Figure 1.44 a) propagate both upstream and downstream, and are felt throughout the entire ﬂow ﬁeld. Note that afreestream Mach number M ∞less than 1 does not guarantee a totally subsonic ﬂow over the body. In expanding over an aerodynamic shape, theﬂow velocity increases above the freestream value, and if M ∞is close enough to 1, the local Mach number may become supersonic in certainregions of the ﬂow. This gives rise to a rule of thumb that M ∞<0.8 for subsonic ﬂow over slender bodies. For blunt bodies, M∞must be even lower to ensure totally subsonic ﬂow. (Again, emphasis is made that theabove is just a loose rule of thumb and should not be taken as a precisequantitative deﬁnition.) Also, we will show later that incompressible ﬂow isa special limiting case of subsonic ﬂow where M→0. 2.Transonic ﬂow (mixed regions where M<1 and M>1). As stated above, ifM ∞is subsonic but is near unity, the ﬂow can become locally supersonic (M>1). This is sketched in Figure 1.44b , which shows pockets of supersonic ﬂow over both the top and bottom surfaces of the airfoil,terminated by weak shock waves behind which the ﬂow becomes subsonicagain. Moreover, if M ∞is increased slightly above unity, a bow shock wave is formed in front of the body; behind this shock wave the ﬂow is locallysubsonic, as shown in Figure 1.44c . This subsonic ﬂow subsequently expands to a low supersonic value over the airfoil. Weak shock waves areusually generated at the trailing edge, sometimes in a “ﬁshtail” pattern asshown in Figure 1.44c . The ﬂow ﬁelds shown in Figure 1.44b andcare characterized by mixed subsonic-supersonic ﬂows and are dominated by thephysics of both types of ﬂow. Hence, such ﬂow ﬁelds are called transonic ﬂows. Again, as a rule of thumb for slender bodies, transonic ﬂows occurfor freestream Mach numbers in the range 0.8 <M ∞<1.2. 3.Supersonic ﬂow (M>1 everywhere). A ﬂow ﬁeld is deﬁned as supersonic if the Mach number is greater than 1 at every point. Supersonic ﬂows arefrequently characterized by the presence of shock waves across which theﬂow properties and streamlines change discontinuously (in contrast to the66 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 1.44 Different regimes of ﬂow. smooth, continuous variations in subsonic ﬂows). This is illustrated in Figure 1.44d for supersonic ﬂow over a sharp-nosed wedge; the ﬂow remains supersonic behind the oblique shock wave from the tip. Alsoshown are distinct expansion waves, which are common in supersonicﬂow. (Again, the listing of M ∞>1.2 is strictly a rule of thumb. For example, in Figure 1.44d , ifθis made large enough, the oblique shock wave will detach from the tip of the wedge and will form a strong, curvedbow shock ahead of the wedge with a substantial region of subsonic ﬂowbehind the wave. Hence, the totally supersonic ﬂow sketched inCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 67 Figure 1.44d is destroyed if θis too large for a given M∞. This shock detachment phenomenon can occur at any value of M∞>1, but the value ofθat which it occurs increases as M∞increases. In turn, if θis made inﬁnitesimally small, the ﬂow ﬁeld in Figure 1.44d holds for M∞≥1.0. These matters will be considered in detail in Chapter 9. However, the above discussion clearly shows that the listing of M∞>1.2 in Figure 1.44d is a very tenuous rule of thumb and should not be taken literally.) In asupersonic ﬂow, because the local ﬂow velocity is greater than the speed ofsound, disturbances created at some point in the ﬂow cannot work their way upstream (in contrast to subsonic ﬂow). This property is one of the mostsigniﬁcant physical differences between subsonic and supersonic ﬂows. It isthe basic reason why shock waves occur in supersonic ﬂows, but do notoccur in steady subsonic ﬂow. We will come to appreciate this differencemore fully in Chapters 7 to 14. 4.Hypersonic ﬂow (very high supersonic speeds). Refer again to the wedge in Figure 1.44d . Assume θis a given, ﬁxed value. As M ∞increases above 1, the shock wave moves closer to the body surface. Also, the strength of theshock wave increases, leading to higher temperatures in the region betweenthe shock and the body (the shock layer). If M ∞is sufﬁciently large, the shock layer becomes very thin, and interactions between the shock waveand the viscous boundary layer on the surface occur. Also, the shock layertemperature becomes high enough that chemical reactions occur in the air.The O 2and N 2molecules are torn apart; that is, the gas molecules dissociate. When M∞becomes large enough such that viscous interaction and/or chemically reacting effects begin to dominate the ﬂow(Figure 1.44e ), the ﬂow ﬁeld is called hypersonic. (Again, a somewhat arbitrary but frequently used rule of thumb for hypersonic ﬂow is M ∞>5.) Hypersonic aerodynamics received a great deal of attention during theperiod 1955–1970 because atmospheric entry vehicles encounter theatmosphere at Mach numbers between 25 (ICBMs) and 36 (the Apollolunar return vehicle). Again during the period 1985–1995, hypersonic ﬂightreceived a great deal of attention with the concept of air-breathingsupersonic-combustion ramjet-powered transatmospheric vehicles toprovide single-stage-to-orbit capability. Today, hypersonic aerodynamics isjust part of the whole spectrum of realistic ﬂight speeds. Some basicelements of hypersonic ﬂow are treated in Chapter 14. In summary, we attempt to organize our study of aerodynamic ﬂows according to one or more of the various categories discussed in this section. The block diagram in Figure 1.45 is presented to help emphasize these categories and toshow how they are related. Indeed, Figure 1.45 serves as a road map for thisentire book. All the material to be covered in subsequent chapters ﬁts into theseblocks, which are lettered for easy reference. For example, Chapter 2 containsdiscussions of some fundamental aerodynamic principles and equations which ﬁtinto both blocks C and D. Chapters 3 to 6 ﬁt into blocks D and E, Chapter 7 ﬁts intoblocks D and F, etc. As we proceed with our development of aerodynamics, we68 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 1.45 Block diagram categorizing the types of aerodynamic ﬂows. will frequently refer to Figure 1.45 in order to help put speciﬁc, detailed material in proper perspective relative to the whole of aerodynamics. 1.11 VISCOUS FLOW: INTRODUCTION TO BOUNDARY LAYERS Section 1.10.2 speaks to the problem of friction in an aerodynamic ﬂow. Frictionalshear stress is deﬁned in Section 1.4; shear stress, τ, exists at any point in a ﬂow where there is a velocity gradient across streamlines. For most problemsin aerodynamics, the local shear stress has a meaningful effect on the ﬂow onlywhere the velocity gradients are substantial. Consider, for example, the ﬂow overthe body shown in Figure 1.42. For the vast region of the ﬂow ﬁeld away from thebody, the velocity gradients are relatively small, and friction plays virtually norole. For the thin region of the ﬂow adjacent to the surface, however, the velocitygradients are large, and friction plays a deﬁning role. This natural division of theﬂow into two regions, one where friction is much more important than the other,was recognized by the famous German ﬂuid dynamicist Ludwig Prandtl in 1904.Prandtl’s concept of the boundary layer created a breakthrough in aerodynamicanalysis. Since that time theoretical analyses of most aerodynamic ﬂows havetreated the region away from the body as an inviscid ﬂow (i.e., no dissipative effects due to friction, thermal conduction, or mass diffusion), and the thin regionimmediately adjacent to the body surface as a viscous ﬂow where these dissipative effects are included. The thin viscous region adjacent to the body is called theboundary layer; for most aerodynamic problems of interest, the boundary layer is very thin compared to the extent of the rest of the ﬂow. But what an effect thisthin boundary layer has! It is the source of the friction drag on an aerodynamicCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 69 body. The friction drag on an Airbus 380 jumbo jet, for example, is generated by the boundary layer that wets the entire surface of the airplane in ﬂight. Thephenomena of ﬂow separation, as sketched in Figure 1.43, is associated withthe presence of the boundary layer; when the ﬂow separates from the surface,it dramatically changes the pressure distribution over the surface resulting in alarge increase in drag called pressure drag. So this thin viscous boundary layer adjacent to the body surface, although small in extent compared to the rest of theﬂow, is extremely important in aerodynamics. Parts 2 and 3 of this book deal primarily with inviscid ﬂows; viscous ﬂow is the subject of Part 4. However, at the end of some of the chapters in Parts 2 and 3,you will ﬁnd a “viscous ﬂow section” (such as the present section) for the beneﬁtof those readers who are interested in examining the practical impact of boundarylayers on the inviscid ﬂows studied in the given chapters. These viscous ﬂowsections are stand-alone sections and do not break the continuity of the inviscidﬂow discussion in Parts 2 and 3; they simply complement those discussions. Why are the velocity gradients inside the boundary layer so large? To help answer this question, ﬁrst consider the purely inviscid ﬂow over the airfoil shapein Figure 1.46. By deﬁnition there is no friction effect, so the streamline thatis right on the surface of the body slips over the surface; for example, the ﬂow velocity at point bon the surface is a ﬁnite value, unhindered by the effect of friction. In actuality, due to friction the inﬁnitesimally thin layer of air moleculesimmediately adjacent to the body surface sticks to the surface, thus it has zero velocity relative to the surface. This is the no-slip condition, and it is the cause of the large velocity gradients within the boundary layer. To see why, consider theﬂow illustrated in Figure 1.47; here the boundary layer is shown greatly magniﬁed Vb bThe streamline that is right on the surface slips over the surface Figure 1.46 Inviscid (frictionless) ﬂow. Vb Va = 0/H9270wy b aBoundary layer /H9254 Figure 1.47 Flow in real life, with friction. The thickness of the boundary layer is greatly overemphasized for clarity.70 PART 1Fundamental Principles in thickness for clarity. The ﬂow velocity at point aon the body surface is zero due to the no-slip condition. Above point a, the velocity increases until it reaches the value of Vbat point bat the outer edge of the boundary layer. Because the boundary layer is so thin, Vbat point bin Figure 1.47 is assumed to be the same as Vbat point bon the body in the inviscid ﬂow shown in Figure 1.46. Conventional boundary layer analysis assumes that the ﬂow conditions at the outer edge of the boundary layer are the same as the surface ﬂow conditions from an inviscid ﬂowanalysis. Examining Figure 1.47, because the ﬂow velocity inside the boundarylayer increases from zero at point ato a signiﬁcant ﬁnite velocity at point b, and this increase takes place over a very short distance because the boundary layer isso thin, then the velocity gradients, the local values of dV/dy, are large. Hence the boundary layer is a region of the ﬂow where frictional effects are dominant. Also identiﬁed in Figure 1.47 is the shear stress at the wall, τ w, and the boundary layer thickness, δ. Both τwandδare important quantities, and a large part of boundary layer theory is devoted to their calculation. It can be shown experimentally and theoretically that the pressure through the boundary layer in a direction perpendicular to the surface is constant. That is,letting p aandpbbe the pressures at points aandb, respectively, in Figure 1.47, where the y-axis is perpendicular to the body at point a, then pa=pb. This is an important phenomenon. This is why the surface pressure distribution calculatedfor an inviscid ﬂow (Figure 1.46) gives accurate results for the real-life surfacepressures; it is because the inviscid calculations give the correct pressure at theouter edge of the thin boundary layer (point bin Figure 1.47), and these pressures are impressed without change through the boundary layer right down to the surface(point a). The preceding statements are reasonable for thin boundary layers that remain attached to the body surface; they do not hold for regions of separatedﬂow such as those sketched in Figure 1.43. Such separated ﬂows are discussed inSections 4.12 and 4.13. Looking more closely at the boundary layer, Figure 1.48 illustrates the velocity proﬁle through the boundary layer. The velocity starts out at zero at the surface and increases continuously to its value of V bat the outer edge. Let us set up coordinate axes xandysuch that xis parallel to the surface and yis normal to the surface, as shown in Figure 1.48. By deﬁnition, a velocity pro- ﬁlegives the variation of velocity in the boundary layer as a function of y. In general, the velocity proﬁles at different xstations are different. Similarly, the temperature proﬁle through the boundary layer is shown in Figure 1.49. The gas Outer edge of boundary layer y xVelocity profile through the boundary layer SurfaceVb = V2 Figure 1.48 Velocity proﬁle through a boundary layer.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 71 Outer edge of boundary layer y Tb Twy xTemperature profile throughthe boundary layer Figure 1.49 Temperature proﬁle through a boundary layer. temperature at the wall (which is the same as the surface temperature of the wall itself—a kind of “no slip” condition on temperature) is Tw, and the temperature at the outer edge of the boundary layer is Tb. As before, the value of Tbis the same as the gas temperature at the surface calculated from an inviscid ﬂow anal-ysis. By deﬁnition, a temperature proﬁle gives the variation of temperature in the boundary layer as a function of y. In general, the temperature proﬁles at different xstations are different. The temperature inside the boundary layer is governed by the combined mechanisms of thermal conduction and frictional dissipation.Thermal conduction is the transfer of heat from a hotter region to a colder regionby random molecular motion. Frictional dissipation, in a very simplistic sense, isthe local heating of the gas due to one streamline rubbing over another, somewhatanalogous to warming your hands by vigorously rubbing them together. A bet-ter explanation of frictional dissipation is that, as a ﬂuid element moves along astreamline inside the boundary layer, it slows down due to frictional shear stressacting on it, and some of the original kinetic energy it had before it entered theboundary layer is converted to internal energy inside the boundary layer, henceincreasing the gas temperature inside the boundary layer. The slope of the velocity proﬁle at the wall is of particular importance because it governs the wall shear stress. Let (dV/dy) y=0be deﬁned as the velocity gradient at the wall. Then the shear stress at the wall is given by τw=μ/parenleftbiggdV dy/parenrightbigg y=0(1.59) where μis the absolute viscosity coefﬁcient (or simply the viscosity) of the gas. The viscosity coefﬁcient has dimensions of mass/(length)(time), as can be veriﬁedfrom Equation (1.59) combined with Newton’s second law. It is a physical propertyof the ﬂuid; μis different for different gases and liquids. Also, μvaries with T. For liquids, μdecreases as Tincreases (we all know that oil gets “thinner” when the temperature is increased). But for gases, μincreases as Tincreases (air72 PART 1Fundamental Principles Temperature, K/H9262, kg/(m)(s) /H11003 105 2501.51.61.71.81.92.02.1 270 290 310 330 350Air Figure 1.50 Variation of viscosity coefﬁcient with temperature. gets “thicker” when the temperature is increased). For air at standard sea-level temperature, μ=1.7894 ×10−5kg/(m)(s) =3.7373 ×10−7slug/(ft)(s) The temperature variation of μfor air over a small range of interest is given in Figure 1.50. Similarly, the slope of the temperature proﬁle at the wall is very important; it dictates the aerodynamic heating to or from the wall. Let (dT/dy)y=0be deﬁned as the temperature gradient at the wall. Then the aerodynamic heating rate (energyper second per unit area) at the wall is given by •qw=−k/parenleftbiggdT dy/parenrightbigg y=0(1.60) where kis the thermal conductivity of the gas, and the minus sign connotes that heat is conducted from a warm region to a cooler region, in the opposite directionas the temperature gradient. That is, if the temperature gradient in Equation (1.60)is positive (temperature increases in the direction above the wall), the heat transferis from the gas intothe wall, opposite to the direction of increasing temperature. If the temperature gradient is negative (temperature decreases in the directionabove the wall), the heat transfer is away from the wall into the gas, again opposite to the direction of increasing temperature. Frequently, the heating or cooling ofa wall by a ﬂow over the wall is called “convective heat transfer,” although fromEquation (1.60) the actual mechanism by which heat is transferred between thegas and the wall is thermal conduction. In this book, we will label the heat transfer taking place between the boundary layer and the wall as aerodynamic heating. Aerodynamic heating is important in high-speed ﬂows, particularly supersonicCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 73 y x x/H9254Leading edge Figure 1.51 Growth of the boundary layer thickness. ﬂows, and it becomes absolutely dominant in hypersonic ﬂows. Finally, we note thatkin Equation (1.60), like μin Equation (1.59), is a physical property of the ﬂuid, and is a function of temperature. For air at standard sea-level temperature, k=2.53×10−2J/(m)(s)(K) =3.16×10−3lb/(s)(◦R) Thermal conductivity is essentially proportional to the viscosity coefﬁcient (i.e,k=(constant) ×μ), so the temperature variation of kis proportional to that shown in Figure 1.49 for μ. Sections 1.7 and 1.8 introduced the Reynolds number as an important simi- larity parameter. Consider the development of a boundary layer on a surface, suchas the ﬂat plate sketched in Figure 1.51. Let xbe measured from the leading edge, that is, from the tip of the plate. Let V ∞be the ﬂow velocity far upstream of the plate. The local Reynolds number at a local distance xfrom the leading edge is deﬁned as Rex=ρ∞V∞x μ∞(1.61) where the subscript ∞is used to denote conditions in the freestream ahead of the plate. The local values of τwandδare functions of Re x; this is shown in Chapter 4, and in more detail in Part 4 of this book. The Reynolds number has a powerful in-ﬂuence over the properties of a boundary layer, and it governs the nature of viscousﬂows in general. We will encounter the Reynolds number frequently in this book. Up to this point in our discussion, we have considered ﬂow streamlines to be smooth and regular curves in space. However, in a viscous ﬂow, and particularlyin boundary layers, life is not quite so simple. There are two basic types of viscousﬂow: 1.Laminar ﬂow, in which the streamlines are smooth and regular and a ﬂuid element moves smoothly along a streamline. 2.Turbulent ﬂow, in which the streamlines break up and a ﬂuid element moves in a random, irregular, and tortuous fashion. If you observe smoke rising from a lit cigarette, as sketched in Figure 1.52, you see ﬁrst a region of smooth ﬂow—laminar ﬂow—and then a transition toirregular, mixed-up ﬂow—turbulent ﬂow. The differences between laminar andturbulent ﬂow are dramatic, and they have a major impact on aerodynamics. Forexample, consider the velocity proﬁles through a boundary layer, as sketched inFigure 1.53. The proﬁles are different, depending on whether the ﬂow is laminar74 PART 1Fundamental Principles Laminar CigaretteTurbulent Figure 1.52 Smoke pattern illustrating transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow. Turbulent /H9254turb /H9254lamV/H11009 Laminar Vy Figure 1.53 Velocity proﬁles for laminar and turbulent boundary layers. Note that the turbulent boundary layer thickness is larger than the laminar boundary layer thickness.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 75 or turbulent. The turbulent proﬁle is “fatter,” or fuller, than the laminar proﬁle. For the turbulent proﬁle, from the outer edge to a point near the surface, the velocityremains reasonably close to the freestream velocity; it then rapidly decreases tozero at the surface. In contrast, the laminar velocity proﬁle gradually decreasesto zero from the outer edge to the surface. Now consider the velocity gradient atthe wall, (dV/dy) y=0, which is the reciprocal of the slope of the curves shown in Figure 1.52 evaluated at y=0. From Figure 1.53, it is clear that /parenleftbiggdV dy/parenrightbigg y=0for laminar ﬂow </parenleftbiggdV dy/parenrightbigg y=0for turbulent ﬂow Recalling Equation (1.59) for τwleads us to the fundamental and highly important fact that laminar shear stress is less than turbulent shear stress: (τw)laminar< (τ w)turbulent This obviously implies that the skin friction exerted on an airplane wing or bodywill depend on whether the boundary layer on the surface is laminar or turbulent,with laminar ﬂow yielding the smaller skin friction drag. The same trends hold for aerodynamic heating. We have for the temperature gradients at the wall: /parenleftbiggdT dy/parenrightbigg y=0for laminar ﬂow </parenleftbiggdT dy/parenrightbigg y=0for turbulent ﬂow Recalling Equation (1.60) for qw, we see that turbulent aerodynamic heating is larger than laminar aerodynamic heating, sometimes considerably larger. At hypersonic speeds, turbulent heat transfer rates can be almost a factor of 10larger than laminar heat transfer rates—a showstopper in some hypersonic vehicledesigns. We will have a lot to say about the effects of turbulent versus laminarﬂows in subsequent sections of this book. In summary, in this section we have presented some introductory thoughts about friction, viscous ﬂows, and boundary layers, in keeping with the intro-ductory nature of this chapter. In subsequent chapters we will expand on thesethoughts, including discussions on how to calculate some of the important prac-tical quantities such as τ w,qw, andδ. 1.12 APPLIED AERODYNAMICS: THE AERODYNAMIC COEFFICIENTS—THEIR MAGNITUDES AND VARIATIONS With the present section, we begin a series of special sections in this book under the general heading of “applied aerodynamics.” The main thrust of this book isto present the fundamentals of aerodynamics, as is reﬂected in the book’s title. However, applications of these fundamentals are liberally sprinkled throughout the book, in the text material, in the worked examples, and in the homeworkproblems. The term applied aerodynamics normally implies the application of76 PART 1Fundamental Principles aerodynamics to the practical evaluation of the aerodynamic characteristics of real conﬁgurations such as airplanes, missiles, and space vehicles moving throughan atmosphere (the earth’s, or that of another planet). Therefore, to enhance thereader’s appreciation of such applications, sections on applied aerodynamics willappear near the end of many of the chapters. To be speciﬁc, in this section,we address the matter of the aerodynamic coefﬁcients deﬁned in Section 1.5; inparticular, we focus on lift, drag, and moment coefﬁcients. These nondimensionalcoefﬁcients are the primary language of applications in external aerodynamics (thedistinction between external and internal aerodynamics was made in Section 1.2).It is important for you to obtain a feeling for typical values of the aerodynamiccoefﬁcients. (For example, do you expect a drag coefﬁcient to be as low as 10 −5, or maybe as high as 1000—does this make sense?) The purpose of this section is tobegin to provide you with such a feeling, at least for some common aerodynamicbody shapes. As you progress through the remainder of this book, make everyeffort to note the typical magnitudes of the aerodynamic coefﬁcients that arediscussed in various sections. Having a realistic feel for these magnitudes is partof your technical maturity. Question: What are some typical drag coefﬁcients for various aerodynamic conﬁgurations? Some basic values are shown in Figure 1.54. The dimensionalanalysis described in Section 1.7 proved that C D=f(M,Re). In Figure 1.54, the drag-coefﬁcient values are for low speeds, essentially incompressible ﬂow;therefore, the Mach number does not come into the picture. (For all practicalpurposes, for an incompressible ﬂow, the Mach number is theoretically zero,not because the velocity goes to zero, but rather because the speed of sound isinﬁnitely large. This will be made clear in Section 8.3.) Thus, for a low-speed ﬂow,the aerodynamic coefﬁcients for a ﬁxed shape at a ﬁxed orientation to the ﬂoware functions of just the Reynolds number. In Figure 1.54, the Reynolds numbersare listed at the left and the drag-coefﬁcient values at the right. In Figure 1.54 a, a ﬂat plate is oriented perpendicular to the ﬂow; this conﬁguration producesthe largest possible drag coefﬁcient of any conventional conﬁguration, namely, C D=D/prime/q∞S=2.0, where Sis the frontal area per unit span, i.e., S=(d)(1), where dis the height of the plate. The Reynolds number is based on the height d; that is, Re =ρ∞V∞d/μ∞=105. Figure 1.54b illustrates ﬂow over a circular cylinder of diameter d; here, CD=1.2, considerably smaller than the vertical plate value in Figure 1.54 a. The drag coefﬁcient can be reduced dramatically by streamlining the body, as shown in Figure 1.54c . Here, CD=0.12; this is an order of magnitude smaller than the circular cylinder in Figure 1.54b . The Reynolds numbers for Figure 1.54 a,b, and care all the same value, based on d (diameter). The drag coefﬁcients are all deﬁned the same, based on a referencearea per unit span of (d)(1). Note that the ﬂow ﬁelds over the conﬁgurations in Figure 1.54 a,b, and cshow a wake downstream of the body; the wake is caused by the ﬂow separating from the body surface, with a low-energy, recirculating ﬂowinside the wake. The phenomenon of ﬂow separation will be discussed in detail inPart 4 of this book, dealing with viscous ﬂows. However, it is clear that the wakesdiminish in size as we progressively go from Figure 1.54 a,b, and c. The fact that C Dalso diminishes progressively from Figure 1.54 a,b, and cis no accident—itCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 77 Separation point Re /H11015 105 Separation pointFlat plate(Broadside) length /H11005 d (a) (b) (c) (d) (e)Cylinder diameter /H11005 d Streamline bodythickness /H11005 d C D /H11005 0.12CD /H11005 1.2CD /H11005 2.0 CD /H11005 1.2 CD /H11005 0.6Cylinderdiameter /H11005 dCylinder diameter /H11005 d1 10Separation point Separation pointSeparation point Re /H11015 10 5 Re /H11015 105 Re /H11015 104 Re /H11015 107 Figure 1.54 Drag coefﬁcients for various aerodynamic shapes. (Source: Talay, T. A., Introduction to the Aerodynamics of Flight, NASA SP-367, 1975). is a direct result of the regions of separated ﬂow becoming progressively smaller. Why is this so? Simply consider this as one of the many interesting questions inaerodynamics—a question that will be answered in due time in this book. Note,in particular that the physical effect of the streamlining in Figure 1.54c results in a very small wake, hence a small value for the drag coefﬁcient. Consider Figure 1.54d , where once again a circular cylinder is shown, but of much smaller diameter. Since the diameter here is 0.1d , the Reynolds number is now 10 4(based on the same freestream V∞,ρ∞, andμ∞as Figure 1.54 a,b, andc). It will be shown in Chapter 3 that CDfor a circular cylinder is relatively independent of Re between Re =104and 105. Since the body shape is the same between Figure 1.54d andb, namely, a circular cylinder, then CDis the same value of 1.2 as shown in the ﬁgure. However, since the drag is given by D/prime=q∞SC D, and Sis one-tenth smaller in Figure 1.54d , then the drag force on the small cylinder in Figure 1.54d is one-tenth smaller than that in Figure 1.54b . Another comparison is illustrated in Figure 1.54c andd. Here we are com- paring a large streamlined body of thickness dwith a small circular cylinder of78 PART 1Fundamental Principles diameter 0.1d . For the large streamlined body in Figure 1.54c , D/prime=q∞SC D=0.12q∞d For the small circular cylinder in Figure 1.54d , D/prime=q∞SC D=q∞(0.1d)(1.2) =0.12q∞d The drag values are the same! Thus, Figure 1.54c anddillustrate that the drag on a circular cylinder is the same as that on the streamlined body which is 10 times thicker—another way of stating the aerodynamic value of streamlining. As a ﬁnal note in regard to Figure 1.54, the ﬂow over a circular cylinder is again shown in Figure 1.54 e. However, now the Reynolds number has been increased to 107, and the cylinder drag coefﬁcient has decreased to 0.6—a dra- matic factor of two less than in Figure 1.54b andd. Why has CDdecreased so precipitously at the higher Reynolds number? The answer must somehow be con-nected with the smaller wake behind the cylinder in Figure 1.54e compared to Figure 1.54b . What is going on here? This is one of the fascinating questions we will answer as we progress through our discussions of aerodynamics in thisbook—an answer that will begin with Section 3.18 and culminate in Part 4 dealingwith viscous ﬂow. At this stage, pause for a moment and note the values ofC Dfor the aero- dynamic shapes in Figure 1.54. With CDbased on the frontal projected area (S=d(1)per unit span), the values of CDrange from a maximum of 2 to numbers as low as 0.12. These are typical values of CDfor aerodynamic bodies. Also, note the values of Reynolds number given in Figure 1.54. Consider a circular cylinder of diameter1mi naﬂ o wa tstandard sea level conditions(ρ ∞=1.23 kg/m3andμ∞=1.789 ×10−5kg/m·s)with a velocity of 45 m/s (close to 100 mi/h). For this case, Re=ρ∞V∞d μ∞=(1.23)(45)(1) 1.789×10−5=3.09×106 Note that the Reynolds number is over 3 million; values of Re in the millions aretypical of practical applications in aerodynamics. Therefore, the large numbersgiven for Re in Figure 1.54 are appropriate. Let us examine more closely the nature of the drag exerted on the various bodies in Figure 1.54. Since these bodies are at zero angle of attack, the drag isequal to the axial force. Hence, from Equation (1.8) the drag per unit span can bewritten as D /prime=/integraldisplayTE LE−pusinθdsu+/integraldisplayTE LEplsinθdsl pressure drag (1.62) +/integraldisplayTE LEτucosθdsu+/integraldisplayTE LEτlcosθdsl skin friction dragCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 79 Separation point Separation point Separation point Re /H11015 105 Separation pointFlat plate(Broadside)length /H11005 dRelative drag force (a) (b) (c) (d) (e)Cylinder diameter/H11005 d Streamlinebodythickness/H11005 d Cylinderdiameter/H11005 d Pressure dragSkin friction dragLargerSame total drag Cylinder diameter /H11005 d1 10 Separation pointSeparation point Re /H11015 10 5 Re /H11015 105 Re /H11015 104 Re /H11015 107 Figure 1.55 The relative comparison between skin friction drag and pressure drag for various aerodynamic shapes. (Source: Talay, T. A., Introduction to the Aerodynamics of Flight, NASA SP-367, 1975). That is, the drag on any aerodynamic body is composed of pressure drag and skin friction drag; this is totally consistent with our discussion in Section 1.5, whereit is emphasized that the only two basic sources of aerodynamic force on a bodyare the pressure and shear stress distributions exerted on the body surface. Thedivision of total drag onto its components of pressure and skin friction drag isfrequently useful in analyzing aerodynamic phenomena. For example, Figure 1.55illustrates the comparison of skin friction drag and pressure drag for the casesshown in Figure 1.54. In Figure 1.55, the bar charts at the right of the ﬁgure givethe relative drag force on each body; the cross-hatched region denotes the amount80 PART 1Fundamental Principles of skin friction drag, and the blank region is the amount of pressure drag. The freestream density and viscosity are the same for Figure 1.55 atoe; however, the freestream velocity V∞is varied by the necessary amount to achieve the Reynolds numbers shown. That is, comparing Figure 1.55b ande, the value of V∞is much larger for Figure 1.55e . Since the drag force is given by D/prime=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞SC D then the drag for Figure 1.55e is much larger than for Figure 1.55b . Also shown in the bar chart is the equal drag between the streamlined body of thickness d and the circular cylinder of diameter 0.1d —a comparison discussed earlier in conjunction with Figure 1.54. Of most importance in Figure 1.55, however, is therelative amounts of skin friction and pressure drag for each body. Note that thedrag of the vertical ﬂat plate and the circular cylinders is dominated by pressuredrag, whereas, in contrast, most of the drag of the streamlined body is due to skinfriction. Indeed, this type of comparison leads to the deﬁnition of two genericbody shapes in aerodynamics, as follows: Blunt body =a body where most of the drag is pressure drag Streamlined body =a body where most of the drag is skin friction drag In Figures 1.54 and 1.55, the vertical ﬂat plate and the circular cylinder are clearlyblunt bodies. The large pressure drag of blunt bodies is due to the massive regions of ﬂow separation which can be seen in Figures 1.54 and 1.55. The reason why ﬂowseparation causes drag will become clear as we progress through our subsequentdiscussions. Hence, the pressure drag shown in Figure 1.55 is more preciselydenoted as “pressure drag due to ﬂow separation”; this drag is frequently calledform drag. (For an elementary discussion of form drag and its physical nature,see Reference 2.) Let us now examine the drag on a ﬂat plate at zero angle of attack, as sketched in Figure 1.56. Here, the drag is completely due to shear stress; there is no pressureforce in the drag direction. The skin friction drag coefﬁcient is deﬁned as C f=D/prime q∞S=D/prime q∞c(1) where the reference area is the planform area per unit span, that is, the surface area as seen by looking down on the plate from above. Cfwill be discussed further in Chapters 4 and 16. However, the purpose of Figure 1.56 is to demonstrate that: 1.Cfis a strong function of Re, where Re is based on the chord length of the plate, Re =ρ∞V∞c/μ∞. Note that Cfdecreases as Re increases. 2.The value of Cfdepends on whether the ﬂow over the plate surface is laminar or turbulent, with the turbulent Cfbeing higher than the laminar Cfat the same Re. What is going on here? What is laminar ﬂow? What is turbulent ﬂow? Why does it affect Cf? The answers to these questions will be addressed in Chapters 4, 15, 17, and 18.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 81 Figure 1.56 Variation of laminar and turbulent skin friction coefﬁcient for a ﬂat plate as a function of Reynolds number based on the chord length of the plate. The intermediate dashed curves are associated with various transition paths from laminar ﬂow to turbulentﬂow. Figure 1.57 Variation of section drag coefﬁcient for an NACA 63-210 airfoil. Re =3×106. 3.The magnitudes of Cfrange typically from 0.001 to 0.01 over a large range of Re. These numbers are considerably smaller than the drag coefﬁcients listed in Figure 1.54. This is mainly due to the different reference areasused. In Figure 1.54, the reference area is a cross-sectional area normal tothe ﬂow; in Figure 1.56, the reference area is the planform area. A ﬂat plate is not a very practical aerodynamic body—it simply has no volume. Let us now consider a body with thickness, namely, an airfoil section.An NACA 63-210 airfoil section is one such example. The variation of the dragcoefﬁcient, c d, with angle of attack is shown in Figure 1.57. Here, as usual, cdis82 PART 1Fundamental Principles deﬁned as cd=D/prime q∞c where D/primeis the drag per unit span. Note that the lowest value of cdis about 0.0045. The NACA 63-210 airfoil is classiﬁed as a “laminar-ﬂow airfoil” because it is designed to promote such a ﬂow at small α. This is the reason for the bucketlike appearance of the cdcurve at low α; at higher α, transition to turbulent ﬂow occurs over the airfoil surface, causing a sharp increase in cd. Hence, the value of cd=0.0045 occurs in a laminar ﬂow. Note that the Reynolds number is 3 million. Once again, a reminder is given that the various aspects of laminar and turbulentﬂows will be discussed in Part 4. The main point here is to demonstrate thattypical airfoil drag-coefﬁcient values are on the order of 0.004 to 0.006. As inthe case of the streamlined body in Figures 1.54 and 1.55, most of this drag isdue to skin friction. However, at higher values of α, ﬂow separation over the top surface of the airfoil begins to appear and pressure drag due to ﬂow separation(form drag) begins to increase. This is why c dincreases with increasing αin Figure 1.57. Let us now consider a complete airplane. In Chapter 3, Figure 3.2 is a photo- graph of the Seversky P-35, a typical ﬁghter aircraft of the late 1930s. Figure 1.58is a detailed drag breakdown for this type of aircraft. Conﬁguration 1 in Figure 1.58is the stripped-down, aerodynamically cleanest version of this aircraft; its dragcoefﬁcient (measured at an angle of attack corresponding to a lift coefﬁcient of C L=0.15) is CD=0.0166. Here, CDis deﬁned as CD=D q∞S where Dis the airplane drag and Sis the planform area of the wing. For conﬁg- urations 2 through 18, various changes are progressively made in order to bringthe aircraft to its conventional, operational conﬁguration. The incremental dragincreases due to each one of these additions are tabulated in Figure 1.58. Notethat the drag coefﬁcient is increased by more than 65 percent by these additions;the value of C Dfor the aircraft in full operational condition is 0.0275. This is a typical airplane drag-coefﬁcient value. The data shown in Figure 1.58 were ob-tained in the full-scale wind tunnel at the NACA Langley Memorial Laboratoryjust prior to World War II. (The full-scale wind tunnel has test-section dimen-sions of 30 by 60 ft, which can accommodate a whole airplane—hence the name“full-scale.”) The values of drag coefﬁcients discussed so far in this section have applied to low-speed ﬂows. In some cases, their variation with the Reynolds number hasbeen illustrated. Recall from the discussion of dimensional analysis in Section 1.7that drag coefﬁcient also varies with the Mach number. Question: What is the effect of increasing the Mach number on the drag coefﬁcient of an airplane?CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 83 Figure 1.58 The breakdown of various sources of drag on a late 1930s airplane, the Seversky XP-41 (derived from the Seversky P-35 shown in Figure 3.2). [Source: Experimental data from Coe, Paul J., “Review of Drag Cleanup Tests in Langley Full-Scale Tunnel (From 1935 to 1945) Applicable to Current General Aviation Airplanes,” NASA TN-D-8206, 1976]. Consider the answer to this question for a Northrop T-38A jet trainer, shown in Figure 1.59. The drag coefﬁcient for this airplane is given in Figure 1.60 asa function of the Mach number ranging from low subsonic to supersonic. Theaircraft is at a small negative angle of attack such that the lift is zero, hence the C Din Figure 1.60 is called the zero-lift drag coefﬁcient. Note that the value of CDis relatively constant from M=0.1 to about 0.86. Why? At Mach numbers of about 0.86, the CDrapidly increases. This large increase in CDnear Mach one is typical of all ﬂight vehicles. Why? Stay tuned; the answers to these questionswill become clear in Part 3 dealing with compressible ﬂow. Also, note in Fig-ure 1.60 that at low subsonic speeds, C Dis about 0.015. This is considerably lower than the 1930s-type airplane illustrated in Figure 1.58; of course, the T-38is a more modern, sleek, streamlined airplane, and its drag coefﬁcient should besmaller. We now turn our attention to lift coefﬁcient and examine some typical values. As a complement to the drag data shown in Figure 1.57 for an NACA 63-21084 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 1.59 Three-view of the Northrop T-38 jet trainer (Courtesy of the U.S. Air Force).

Re =3×106. No ﬂap deﬂection. airfoil, the variation of lift coefﬁcient versus angle of attack for the same airfoil is shown in Figure 1.61. Here, we see clincreasing linearly with αuntil a maximum value is obtained near α=14◦, beyond which there is a precipitous drop in lift. Why does clvary with αin such a fashion—in particular, what causes the sudden drop in clbeyond α=14◦? An answer to this question will evolve over the ensuing chapters. For our purpose in the present section, observe the values ofcl; they vary from about −1.0 to a maximum of 1.5, covering a range of αfrom−12 to 14◦. Conclusion: For an airfoil, the magnitude of clis about a factor of 100 larger than cd. A particularly important ﬁgure of merit in aerodynamics is the ratio of lift to drag, the so-called L/Dratio; many aspects of the ﬂight performance of a vehicle are directly related to the L/Dratio (see, e.g., Reference 2). Other things being equal, a higher L/Dmeans better ﬂight performance. For an airfoil— a conﬁguration whose primary function is to produce lift with as little drag aspossible—values of L/Dare large. For example, from Figures 1.57 and 1.61, at α=4 ◦,cl=0.6 and cd=0.0046, yielding L/D=0.6 0.0046=130. This value is much larger than those for a complete airplane, as we will soon see. To illustrate the lift coefﬁcient for a complete airplane, Figure 1.62 shows the variation of CLwithαfor the T-38 in Figure 1.59. Three curves are shown, each for a different ﬂap deﬂection angle. (Flaps are sections of the wing at the trailingedge which, when deﬂected downward, increase the lift of the wing. See Section5.17 of Reference 2 for a discussion of the aerodynamic properties of ﬂaps.) Notethat at a given α, the deﬂection of the ﬂaps increases C L. The values of CLshown86 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 1.62 Variation of lift coefﬁcient with angle of attack for the T-38. Three curves are shown corresponding to three different ﬂap deﬂections. Freestream Mach number is 0.4. (Courtesy of theU.S. Air Force). in Figure 1.62 are about the same as that for an airfoil—on the order of 1. On the other hand, the maximum L/Dratio of the T-38 is about 10—considerably smaller than that for an airfoil alone. Of course, an airplane has a fuselage, enginenacelles, etc., which are elements with other functions than just producing lift,and indeed produce only small amounts of lift while at the same time adding a lotof drag to the vehicle. Thus, the L/Dratio for an airplane is expected to be much less than that for an airfoil alone. Moreover, the wing on an airplane experiences amuch higher pressure drag than an airfoil due to the adverse aerodynamic effectsof the wing tips (a topic for Chapter 5). This additional pressure drag is calledinduced drag, and for short, stubby wings, such as on the T-38, the induced dragcan be large. (We must wait until Chapter 5 to ﬁnd out about the nature of induceddrag.) As a result, the L/Dratio of the T-38 is fairly small as most airplanes go. For example, the maximum L/Dratio for the Boeing B-52 strategic bomber is 21.5 (see Reference 45). However, this value is still considerably smaller thanthat for an airfoil alone.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 87 Figure 1.63 Variation of section moment coefﬁcient about the quarter chord for an NACA 63-210 airfoil. Re=3×106. Finally, we turn our attention to the values of moment coefﬁcients. Figure 1.63 illustrates the variation of cm,c/4for the NACA 63-210 airfoil. Note that this is anegative quantity; all conventional airfoils produce negative, or “pitch-down,” moments. (Recall the sign convention for moments given in Section 1.5.) Also, notice that its value is on the order of −0.035. This value is typical of a moment coefﬁcient—on the order of hundredths. With this, we end our discussion of typical values of the aerodynamic coef- ﬁcients deﬁned in Section 1.5. At this stage, you should reread this section, nowfrom the overall perspective provided by a ﬁrst reading, and make certain to ﬁxin your mind the typical values discussed—it will provide a useful “calibration”for our subsequent discussions. EXAMPLE 1.12 Consider the Seversky P-35 shown in Figure 3.2. Assume that the drag breakdown given in Figure 1.58 for the XP-41 applies also to the P-35. Note that the data given in Fig-ure 1.58 apply for the speciﬁc condition where C L=0.15. The wing planform area and the gross weight of the P-35 are 220 ft2and 5599 lb, respectively. Calculate the horse- power required for the P-35 to ﬂy in steady level ﬂight with CL=0.15 at standard sea level. ■Solution From basic mechanics, if Fis a force exerted on a body moving with a velocity V, the power generated by this system is P=F·V. When FandVare in the same direction, then the dot product becomes P=FVwhere FandVare the scalar magnitudes of force and velocity, respectively. When the airplane is in steady level ﬂight (no acceleration)the thrust obtained from the engine exactly counteracts the drag, i.e., T=D. Hence the power required for the airplane to ﬂy at a given velocity V ∞is P=TV∞=DV∞ (E1.12.1)88 PART 1Fundamental Principles To obtain the power required for the P-35 to ﬂy in steady level ﬂight with CL= 0.15, at standard sea level, we must ﬁrst calculate both DandV∞for this ﬂight condition. To obtain V∞, we note that in steady level ﬂight the weight is exactly balanced by the aerodynamic lift; i.e., W=L (E1.12.2) From Section 1.5, we have W=L=q∞SCL=1/2ρ ∞V2 ∞SCL (E1.12.3) where Sis the planform area of the wing. Solving Equation (E1.12.3) for V∞, we have V∞=/radicalbigg 2W ρ∞SCL(E1.12.4) At standard sea level, from Appendix E (using English engineering units, consistent with the units used in this example), ρ∞=0.002377 slug/ft3. Also, for the P-35 in this example, S=220 ft2,W=5599 lb, and CL=0.15. Hence, from Equation (E1.12.3), we have V∞=/radicalbigg 2(5599) (0.002377)(220)(0.15)=377.8 ft/s This is the ﬂight velocity when the airplane is ﬂying at standard sea level such that its liftcoefﬁcient is 0.15. We note that to ﬂy in steady level ﬂight at any other velocity the liftcoefﬁcient would have to be different; to ﬂy slower C Lmust be larger and to ﬂy faster CL must be smaller. Recall that CLfor a given airplane is a function of angle of attack, so our ﬂight condition in this example with CL=0.15 corresponds to a speciﬁc angle of attack of the airplane. Noting that 88 ft/s =60 mi/h, V∞in miles per hour is (377.8)/parenleftbig60 88/parenrightbig =257.6 mi/h. In the reference book The American Fighter by Enzo Angelucci and Peter Bowers, Orion Books, New York, 1985, the cruising speed of the Seversky P-35 is given as 260 mi/h.Thus, for all practical purposes, the value of C L=0.15 pertains to cruise velocity at sea level, and this explains why the drag data given in Figure 1.58 was given for a liftcoefﬁcient of 0.15. To complete the calculation of power required, we need the value of D. From Fig- ure 1.58, the drag coefﬁcient for the airplane in full conﬁguration is C D=0.0275. For the calculated ﬂight velocity, the dynamic pressure is q∞=1/2ρ ∞V2 ∞=1/2(0.002377)(377.8)2=169.6 lb/ft2 Thus, D=q∞SCD=(169.6)(220)(0.0275) =1026 lb From Equation (E1.12.1), P=DV∞=(1026)(377.8) =3.876×105ft lb/sCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 89 Note that 1 horsepower is 550 ft lb/s. Thus, in horsepower, P=3.876×105 550=704 hp The P-35 was equipped with a Pratt & Whitney R-1830-45 engine rated at 1050 hp. The power required at cruising velocity calculated here is 704 hp, consistent with this enginethrottled back for efﬁcient cruise conditions. The purpose of this worked example is to illustrate typical values of C LandCDfor a real airplane ﬂying at real conditions, consistent with the subtitle of this section “Ap-plied Aerodynamics: The Aerodynamic Coefﬁcients—Their Magnitudes and Variations.”Moreover, we have shown how these coefﬁcients are used to calculate useful aerody-namic performance characteristics for an airplane, such as cruising velocity and powerrequired for steady level ﬂight. This example also underscores the importance and utilityof aerodynamic coefﬁcients. We made these calculations for a given airplane knowing only the values of the lift and drag coefﬁcients, thus again reinforcing the importance of the dimensional analysis given in Section 1.7 and the powerful concept of ﬂow similaritydiscussed in Section 1.8. 1.13 HISTORICAL NOTE: THE ILLUSIVE CENTER OF PRESSURE The center of pressure of an airfoil was an important matter during the devel- opment of aeronautics. It was recognized in the nineteenth century that, for aheavier-than-air machine to ﬂy at stable, equilibrium conditions (e.g., straight-and-level ﬂight), the moment about the vehicle’s center of gravity must be zero(see Chapter 7 of Reference 2). The wing lift acting at the center of pressure,which is generally a distance away from the center of gravity, contributes sub-stantially to this moment. Hence, the understanding and prediction of the centerof pressure was felt to be absolutely necessary in order to design a vehicle withproper equilibrium. On the other hand, the early experimenters had difﬁcultymeasuring the center of pressure, and much confusion reigned. Let us examinethis matter further. The ﬁrst experiments to investigate the center of pressure of a lifting surface were conducted by the Englishman George Cayley (1773–1857) in 1808. Cayleywas the inventor of the modern concept of the airplane, namely, a vehicle withﬁxed wings, a fuselage, and a tail. He was the ﬁrst to separate conceptually thefunctions of lift and propulsion; prior to Cayley, much thought had gone intoornithopters—machines that ﬂapped their wings for both lift and thrust. Cayleyrejected this idea, and in 1799, on a silver disk now in the collection of the ScienceMuseum in London, he inscribed a sketch of a rudimentary airplane with all thebasic elements we recognize today. Cayley was an active, inventive, and long-lived man, who conducted numerous pioneering aerodynamic experiments andfervently believed that powered, heavier-than-air, manned ﬂight was inevitable.90 PART 1Fundamental Principles (See Chapter 1 of Reference 2 for an extensive discussion of Cayley’s contribu- tions to aeronautics.) In 1808, Cayley reported on experiments of a winged model which he tested as a glider and as a kite. His comments on the center of pressure are as follows: By an experiment made with a large kite formed of an hexagon with wings extended from it, all so constructed as to present a hollow curve to the current, I found thatwhen loaded nearly to 1 lb to a foot and 1/2, it required the center of gravity to besuspended so as to leave the anterior and posterior portions of the surface in the ratioof 3 to 7. But as this included the tail operating with a double leverage behind, Ithink such hollow surfaces relieve about an equal pressure on each part, when theyare divided in the ratio of 5 to 12, 5 being the anterior portion. It is really surprisingto ﬁnd so great a difference, and it obliges the center of gravity of ﬂying machinesto be much forwarder of the center of bulk (the centroid) than could be supposed apriori. Here, Cayley is saying that the center of pressure is 5 units from the leading edge and 12 units from the trailing edge (i.e., xcp=5/17c ). Later, he states in addition: “I tried a small square sail in one plane, with the weight nearly the same, and Icould not perceive that the center-of-resistance differed from the center of bulk.”That is, Cayley is stating that the center of pressure in this case is 1/2c . There is no indication from Cayley’s notes that he recognized that center of pressure moves when the lift, or angle of attack, is changed. However, there is nodoubt that he was clearly concerned with the location of the center of pressureand its effect on aircraft stability. The center of pressure on a ﬂat surface inclined at a small angle to the ﬂow was studied by Samuel P. Langley during the period 1887–1896. Langley wasthe secretary of the Smithsonian at that time, and devoted virtually all his timeand much of the Smithsonian’s resources to the advancement of powered ﬂight.Langley was a highly respected physicist and astronomer, and he approached theproblem of powered ﬂight with the systematic and structured mind of a scientist.Using a whirling arm apparatus as well as scores of rubber-band powered models,he collected a large bulk of aerodynamic information with which he subsequentlydesigned a full-scale aircraft. The efforts of Langley to build and ﬂy a successfulairplane resulted in two dismal failures in which his machine fell into the PotomacRiver—the last attempt being just 9 days before the Wright brothers’ historic ﬁrstﬂight on December 17, 1903. In spite of these failures, the work of Langley helpedin many ways to advance powered ﬂight. (See Chapter 1 of Reference 2 for moredetails.) Langley’s observations on the center of pressure for a ﬂat surface inclined to the ﬂow are found in the Langley Memoir on Mechanical Flight, Part I, 1887 to 1896, by Samuel P. Langley, and published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1911—5 years after Langley’s death. In this paper, Langley states: The center-of-pressure in an advancing plane in soaring ﬂight is always in advance of the center of ﬁgure, and moves forward as the angle-of-inclination of the sustainingCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 91 surfaces diminishes, and, to a less extent, as horizontal ﬂight increases in velocity. These facts furnish the elementary ideas necessary in discussing the problem ofequilibrium, whose solution is of the most vital importance to successful ﬂight. The solution would be comparatively simple if the position of the center-of- pressure could be accurately known beforehand, but how difﬁcult the solution ismay be realized from a consideration of one of the facts just stated, namely, that theposition of the center-of-pressure in horizontal ﬂight shifts with velocity of the ﬂightitself. Here, we see that Langley is fully aware that the center of pressure moves over a lifting surface, but that its location is hard to pin down. Also, he notes the correct variation for a ﬂat plate, namely, xcpmoves forward as the angle of attack decreases. However, he is puzzled by the behavior of xcpfor a curved (cambered) airfoil. In his own words: Later experiments conducted under my direction indicate that upon the curved sur- faces I employed, the center-of-pressure moves forward with an increase in the angleof elevation, and backward with a decrease, so that it may lie even behind the centerof the surface. Since for some surfaces the center-of-pressure moves backward, andfor others forward, it would seem that there might be some other surface for which itwill be ﬁxed. Here, Langley is noting the totally opposite behavior of the travel of the center of pressure on a cambered airfoil in comparison to a ﬂat surface, and is indicating ever so slightly some of his frustration in not being able to explain his results ina rational scientiﬁc way. Three-hundred-ﬁfty miles to the west of Langley, in Dayton, Ohio, Orville and Wilbur Wright were also experimenting with airfoils. As described in Sec-tion 1.1, the Wrights had constructed a small wind tunnel in their bicycle shopwith which they conducted aerodynamic tests on hundreds of different airfoil andwing shapes during the fall, winter, and spring of 1901–1902. Clearly, the Wrightshad an appreciation of the center of pressure, and their successful airfoil designused on the 1903 Wright Flyer is a testimonial to their mastery of the problem.Interestingly enough, in the written correspondence of the Wright brothers, onlyone set of results for the center of pressure can be found. This appears in Wilbur’snotebook, dated July 25, 1905, in the form of a table and a graph. The graph isshown in Figure 1.64—the original form as plotted by Wilbur. Here, the centerof pressure, given in terms of the percentage of distance from the leading edge, isplotted versus angle of attack. The data for two airfoils are given, one with largecurvature (maximum height to chord ratio =1/12) and one with more moderate curvature (maximum height to chord ratio =1/20). These results show the now familiar travel of the center of pressure for a curved airfoil, namely, x cpmoves forward as the angle of attack is increased, at least for small to moderate valuesofα. However, the most forward excursion of x cpin Figure 1.64 is 33 percent be- hind the leading edge—the center of pressure is always behind the quarter-chordpoint.92 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 1.64 Wright brothers’ measurements of the center of pressure as a function of angle of attack for a curved (cambered) airfoil. Center of pressure is plotted on the ordinate in terms of percentage distance along the chord from the leading edge. This ﬁgure shows the actual data as hand-plotted byWilbur Wright, which appears in Wilbur’s notebook dated July 25, 1905. The ﬁrst practical airfoil theory, valid for thin airfoils, was developed by Ludwig Prandtl and his colleagues at G¨ ottingen, Germany, during the period just prior to and during World War I. This thin airfoil theory is described in detail inChapter 4. The result for the center of pressure for a curved (cambered) airfoilis given by Equation (4.66), and shows that x cpmoves forward as the angle of attack (hence cl) increases, and that it is always behind the quarter-chord point for ﬁnite, positive values of cl. This theory, in concert with more sophisticated wind-tunnel measurements that were being made during the period 1915–1925,ﬁnally brought the understanding and prediction of the location of the center ofpressure for a cambered airfoil well into focus. Because x cpmakes such a large excursion over the airfoil as the angle of attack is varied, its importance as a basic and practical airfoil property has diminished.Beginning in the early 1930s, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics(NACA), at its Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in Virginia, measuredthe properties of several systematically designed families of airfoils—airfoilswhich became a standard in aeronautical engineering. These NACA airfoils arediscussed in Sections 4.2 and 4.3. Instead of giving the airfoil data in terms of lift,drag, and center of pressure, the NACA chose the alternate systems of reportinglift, drag, and moments about either the quarter-chord point or the aerodynamicCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 93 center. These are totally appropriate alternative methods of deﬁning the force- and-moment system on an airfoil, as discussed in Section 1.6 and illustrated inFigure 1.26. As a result, the center of pressure is rarely given as part of modernairfoil data. On the other hand, for three-dimensional bodies, such as slenderprojectiles and missiles, the location of the center of pressure still remains animportant quantity, and modern missile data frequently include x cp. Therefore, a consideration of center of pressure still retains its importance when viewed overthe whole spectrum of ﬂight vehicles. 1.14 HISTORICAL NOTE: AERODYNAMIC COEFFICIENTS In Section 1.5, we introduced the convention of expressing aerodynamic force interms of an aerodynamic coefﬁcient, such as L= 1 2ρ∞V2 ∞SC L and D=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞SC D where LandDare lift and drag, respectively, and CLandCDare the lift coef- ﬁcient and drag coefﬁcient, respectively. This convention, expressed in the formshown above, dates from about 1920. But the use of some type of aerodynamiccoefﬁcients goes back much further. In this section, let us brieﬂy trace the geneal-ogy of aerodynamic coefﬁcients. For more details, see the author’s recent book,A History of Aerodynamics and Its Impact on Flying Machines (Reference 58). The ﬁrst person to deﬁne and use aerodynamic force coefﬁcients was Otto Lilienthal, the famous German aviation pioneer at the end of the nineteenth cen-tury. Interested in heavier-than-ﬂight from his childhood, Lilienthal carried out theﬁrst deﬁnitive series of aerodynamic force measurements on cambered (curved)airfoil shapes using a whirling arm. His measurements were obtained over a pe-riod of 23 years, culminating in the publication of his book Der Vogelﬂug als Grundlage der Fliegekunst (Birdﬂight as the Basis of Aviation) in 1889. Manyof the graphs in his book are plotted in the form that today we identify as a dragpolar, that is, a plot of drag coefﬁcient versus lift coefﬁcient, with the differentdata points being measured at angles of attack ranging from below zero to 90 ◦. Lilienthal had a degree in Mechanical Engineering, and his work reﬂected a tech-nical professionalism greater than most at that time. Beginning in 1891, he puthis research into practice by designing several gliders, and executing over 2000successful glider ﬂights before his untimely death in a crash on August 9, 1896. Atthe time of his death, Lilienthal was working on the design of an engine to powerhis machines. Had he lived, there is some conjecture that he would have beaten theWright brothers in the race for the ﬁrst heavier-than-air, piloted, powered ﬂight. In his book, Lilienthal introduced the following equations for the normal and axial forces, which he denoted by NandT, respectively (for normal and94 PART 1Fundamental Principles “tangential”) N=0.13η FV2(1.63) and T=0.13θ FV2(1.64) where, in Lilienthal’s notation, Fwas the reference planform area of the wing in m2,Vis the freestream velocity in m/s, and NandTare in units of kilogram force (the force exerted on one kilogram of mass by gravity at sea level). The number 0.13 is Smeaton’s coefﬁcient, a concept and quantity stemming from measure-ments made in the eighteenth century on ﬂat plates oriented perpendicular to theﬂow. Smeaton’s coefﬁcient is proportional to the density of the freestream; itsuse is archaic, and it went out of favor at the beginning of the twentieth century.By means of Equations (1.63) and (1.64) Lilienthal introduced the “normal” and“tangential” coefﬁcients, ηandθversus angle of attack. A copy of this table, reproduced in a paper by Octave Chanute in 1897, is shown in Figure 1.65. Thisbecame famous as the “Lilienthal Tables,” and was used by the Wright brothersfor the design of their early gliders. It is proven in Reference 58 that Lilienthaldid not use Equations (1.63) and (1.64) explicitly to reduce his experimental datato coefﬁcient form, but rather determined his experimental values for ηandθ by dividing the experimental measurements for NandTby his measured force on the wing at 90 ◦angle of attack. In so doing, he divided out the inﬂuence of uncertainties in Smeaton’s coefﬁcient and the velocity, the former being particu-larly important because the classical value of Smeaton’s coefﬁcient of 0.13 was inerror by almost 40 percent. (See Reference 58 for more details.) Nevertheless, wehave Otto Lilienthal to thank for the concept of aerodynamic force coefﬁcients,a tradition that has been followed in various modiﬁed forms to the present time. Following on the heals of Lilienthal, Samuel Langley at the Smithsonian Institution published whirling arm data for the resultant aerodynamic force Ron a ﬂat plate as a function of angle of attack, using the following equation: R=kSV 2F(α) (1.65) where Sis the planform area, kis the more accurate value of Smeaton’s coef- ﬁcient (explicitly measured by Langley on his whirling arm), and F(α)was the corresponding force coefﬁcient, a function of angle of attack. The Wright brothers preferred to deal in terms of lift and drag, and used ex- pressions patterned after Lilienthal and Langley to deﬁne lift and drag coefﬁcients: L=kSV2CL (1.66) D=kSV2CD (1.67) The Wrights were among the last to use expressions written explicitly in terms ofSmeaton’s coefﬁcient k. Gustave Eiffel in 1909 deﬁned a “unit force coefﬁcient” K ias R=KiSV2(1.68)Figure 1.65 The Lilienthal Table of normal and axial force coefﬁcients. This is a facsimile of the actual table that was published by Octave Chanute in an article entitled “Sailing Flight,” The Aeronautical Annual, 1897, which was subsequently used by the Wright brothers. 9596 PART 1Fundamental Principles In Equation (1.68), Smeaton’s coefﬁcient is nowhere to be seen; it is buried in the direct measurement of Ki. (Eiffel, of Eiffel Tower fame, built a large wind tunnel in 1909, and for the next 14 years reigned as France’s leading aerodynamicist untilhis death in 1923.) After Eiffel’s work, Smeaton’s coefﬁcient was never used inthe aerodynamic literature—it was totally pass´ e. Gorrell and Martin, in wind tunnel tests carried out in 1917 at MIT on various airfoil shapes, adopted Eiffel’s approach, giving expressions for lift and drag: L=K yAV2(1.69) D=KxAV2(1.70) where Adenoted planform area and KyandKxwere the lift and drag coefﬁcients, respectively. For a short period, the use of KyandKxbecame popular in the United States. However, also by 1917 the density ρbegan to appear explicitly in expressions for force coefﬁcients. In NACA Technical Report No. 20, entitled “AerodynamicCoefﬁcients and Transformation Tables,” we ﬁnd the following expression: F=CρSV 2 where Fis the total force acting on the body, ρis the freestream density, and Cis the force coefﬁcient, which was described as “an abstract number, varying for a given airfoil with its angle of incidence, independent of the choice of units,provided these are consistently used for all four quantities ( F,ρ,S, and V).” Finally, by the end of World War I, Ludwig Prandtl at Gottingen University in Germany established the nomenclature that is accepted as standard today.Prandtl was already famous by 1918 for his pioneering work on airfoil and wingaerodynamics, and for his conception and development of boundary layer theory.(See Section 5.8 for a biographical description of Prandtl.) Prandtl reasoned thatthe dynamic pressure, 1 2ρ∞V2 ∞(he called it “dynamical pressure”), was well suited to describe aerodynamic force. In his 1921 English-language review ofworks performed at Gottingen before and during World War I (Reference 59), hewrote for the aerodynamic force, W=cFq (1.71) where Wis the force, Fis the area of the surface, qis the dynamic pressure, and cis a “pure number” (i.e., the force coefﬁcient). It was only a short, quick step to express lift and drag as L=q ∞SC L (1.72) and D=q∞SC D (1.73) where CLandCDare the “pure numbers” referred to by Prandtl (i.e., the lift and drag coefﬁcients). And this is the way it has been ever since.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 97 1.15 SUMMARY Refer again to the road map for Chapter 1 given in Figure 1.11. Read again each block in this diagram as a reminder of the material we have covered. If you feeluncomfortable about some of the concepts, or if your memory is slightly “foggy”on certain points, go back and reread the pertinent sections until you have masteredthe material. This chapter has been primarily qualitative, emphasizing deﬁnitions and ba- sic concepts. However, some of the more important quantitative relations aresummarized below: The normal, axial, lift, drag, and moment coefﬁcients for an aerodynamic bodycan be obtained by integrating the pressure and skin friction coefﬁcients overthe body surface from the leading to the trailing edge.

Two important similarityparameters are Mach number M=V/aand Reynolds number Re=ρVc/μ. If two or more ﬂows are dynamically similar, then the force coefﬁcients C L,CD, etc., are the same.98 PART 1Fundamental Principles In ﬂuid statics, the governing equation is the hydrostatic equation: dp=−gρdy (1.52) For a constant density medium, this integrates to p+ρgh=constant (1.54) or p1+ρgh1=p2+ρgh2 Such equations govern, among other things, the operation of a manometer, and also lead to Archimedes’ principle that the buoyancy force on a body immersedin a ﬂuid is equal to the weight of the ﬂuid displaced by the body. 1.16 INTEGRATED WORK CHALLENGE: FORWARD-FACING AXIAL AERODYNAMIC FORCE ON AN AIRFOIL—CAN IT HAPPENAND, IF SO, HOW? Note: This section is the ﬁrst of a number of “Integrated Work Challenges” that appear at the end of a chapter. In contrast to the numerous worked examples that appear at the end of speciﬁc sections and which bear on the material just in thatspeciﬁc section, the concept of the “Integrated Work Challenge” is to provide anextended worked example that bears on the chapter as a whole—that serves tointegrate and use material from many sections of the chapter. Concept: Imagine that you place yourself on the chord line of an airfoil that is oriented at a given angle of attack in a ﬂow, such as shown in Figure 1.17. The airfoil is feeling an aerodynamic force generated by the net pressure and shearstress distributions exerted on every square centimeter of the exposed surface ofthe airfoil (Figure 1.18). There is no propulsion device (no jet engine, rocket,propeller, etc.) on the airfoil, so there is no source of a forward-facing thrust onthe airfoil (at least you do not think so). Looking forward along the chord line,common sense (sometimes called “intuition”) tells you that the aerodynamic forcemust always be in the opposite direction, i.e., always “dragging” you back. Surprise: Your intuition is wrong. There is a situation where the net aerodynamic force results in a forward-facing component along the chord line, i.e., a forward- facing axial force acting on the airfoil. In Figure 1.17, such a forward-facing axialforce would be negative. This situation was ﬁrst noticed by the German engineer Otto Lilienthal during his whirling arm experiments before 1889. (See Anderson, A History of Aerody- namics, Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 138–164). In his book Birdﬂight as the Basis of Aviation, page 69, he contrasts the aerodynamic force generatedon a cambered (curved) airfoil compared to that on a ﬂat plate: “Under these con-ditions the characteristic difference of curved surfaces against planes appears stillmore striking; not only does the direction of the air pressures closely approachthat of the perpendicular to the surface, but for certain angles it actually passesCHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 99 beyond it to the other side, converting the usual restraining component into a pro- pelling component.” Indeed, turning to Figure 1.65 in Section 1.14, you quicklysee negative “tangentials”‚ i.e., a negative forward-facing axial force, tabulatedfor a wide range of angle of attack. This situation was treated as a “curiosity”;such a forward-facing axial force is counterintuitive. It is real, however. Challenge: Explain this forward-facing axial force, and ﬁnd the conditions under which it occurs.Solution: The solution to this problem is based on geometry. It requires a close examination of the aerodynamic force diagramed in Figure 1.17 and an under- standing of the meaning and signiﬁcance of resolving the resultant aerodynamicforce Rinto its components normal and parallel to the chord (the normal and axial components NandA, respectively) and alternatively resolving Rinto its components normal and parallel to the freestream velocity (the lift Land drag D, respectively). Since we are interested in the case of a forward-facing axial force,i.e., a negative value of A, let us ﬁrst examine what Figure 1.17 would look like if the axial force were zero. This special case is sketched in Figure 1.66 a. Here, because the axial force is zero, the normal force Nis the resultant force Ron the airfoil. Since, by deﬁnition, Nis perpendicular to the chord line, then Ris perpendicular to the chord line; i.e., the only way for the axial force to be zero isfor the resultant aerodynamic force to be perpendicular to the chord line. Sincethe angle between the chord line and the freestream is, by deﬁnition, the angle ofattack α, then from Figure 1.66 a, where Lis perpendicular to the freestream and Ris perpendicular to the chord line, the angle between the lift Land the resultant Ris also equal to α. From the trigonometry of Figure 1.66, D L=tanα or, L D=1 tanα=cotα Consider the case when the drag Dis actually smaller than that shown in Fig- ure 1.66 a, as sketched in Figure 1.66b . In this case, when Ris resolved into its normal and axial components, the axial component is facing forward, i.e., Ais now facing forward along the chord line. Because Din Figure 1.66b is smaller than in Figure 1.66 a, D L<tanα or, L D>cotα This is the answer. When the lift-to-drag ratio for the airfoil is larger than thecotangent of the angle of attack, then there exists a forward-facing axial force onthe airfoil, the “propelling component,” in the words of Otto Lilienthal quotedearlier.100 PART 1Fundamental Principles D /H9251 /H9251L N, R (a) D V/H11009L AN (b)RV/H11009 /H9251 Chord lineChord line Figure 1.66 Illustration of the condition for a forward-facing axial force. ( a) Resultant force along the normal. (b ) Resultant force ahead of the normal. For example, take the case of a particular airfoil, the NACA 2412 airfoil, with lift and drag data given in Figures 4.10 and 4.11, respectively. (The fact that we are leaping ahead several chapters is irrelevant; we are just extracting someexperimental data for an airfoil.) At α=6 ◦, from Figure 4.10 we see that the airfoil lift coefﬁcient is c/lscript=0.88, and from Figure 4.11 the drag coefﬁcient is cd=0.008. The lift-to-drag ratio is c/lscript cd=0.88 0.008=110 In comparison, cot 6◦=9.52CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 101 Hence, in this case the airfoil lift-to-drag ratio is much larger than the cot α, and the condition L D>cotα is satisﬁed; the airfoil experiences a forward-facing axial force. Note: The lift-to-drag ratios for airfoils can be much higher than the lift- to-drag ratios for whole airplanes. Compare the value of 110 obtained here for the NACA 2412 airfoil with the value of 14 for the executive jet transport inExample 1.7. One of the reasons for this is that the whole airplane has a greatersurface area contributed by parts of the airplane that do not produce lift, with aconsequently much larger skin-friction drag. Also note: As explained in Chapter 4, by convention, the lift and drag co- efﬁcients for an airfoil are expressed by lowercase letters, whereas those for athree-dimensional body, such as the airplane in Example 1.7, are expressed byuppercase letters. We have followed this convention in our present discussion. Finally, return to the quote from Otto Lilienthal given at the beginning of this section. He makes a distinction between “curved surfaces against planes,”meaning that his measurements revealed a forward-facing axial force, i.e., a “pro-pelling component,” only for the cambered (curved) airfoils, but not for ﬂat plates(“planes”). This begs the question: Can a forward-facing axial force occur on aﬂat plate? Answering this question is the essence of Problem 1.20 at the end ofthis chapter. 1.17 PROBLEMS 1.1For most gases at standard or near standard conditions, the relationshipamong pressure, density, and temperature is given by the perfect gasequation of state: p=ρRT, where Ris the speciﬁc gas constant. For air at near standard conditions, R=287 J/(kg ·K)in the International System of Units and R=1716 ft ·lb/(slug · ◦R)in the English Engineering System of Units. (More details on the perfect gas equation ofstate are given in Chapter 7.) Using the above information, consider thefollowing two cases: a. At a given point on the wing of a Boeing 727, the pressure and temperature of the air are 1.9 ×10 4N/m2and 203 K, respectively. Calculate the density at this point. b. At a point in the test section of a supersonic wind tunnel, the pressure and density of the air are 1058 lb/ft2and 1.23 ×10−3slug/ft3, respectively. Calculate the temperature at this point. 1.2Starting with Equations (1.7), (1.8), and (1.11), derive in detailEquations (1.15), (1.16), and (1.17). 1.3Consider an inﬁnitely thin ﬂat plate of chord cat an angle of attack αin a supersonic ﬂow. The pressures on the upper and lower surfaces aredifferent but constant over each surface; that is, p u(s)=c1and102 PART 1Fundamental Principles pl(s)=c2, where c1andc2are constants and c2>c1. Ignoring the shear stress, calculate the location of the center of pressure. 1.4Consider an inﬁnitely thin ﬂat plate witha1mchord at an angle of attack of 10◦in a supersonic ﬂow. The pressure and shear stress distributions on the upper and lower surfaces are given by pu=4×104(x−1)2+ 5.4×104,pl=2×104(x−1)2+1.73×105,τu=288x−0.2, and τl=731x−0.2, respectively, where xis the distance from the leading edge in meters and pandτare in newtons per square meter. Calculate the normal and axial forces, the lift and drag, moments about the leadingedge, and moments about the quarter chord, all per unit span. Also,calculate the location of the center of pressure. 1.5Consider an airfoil at 12 ◦angle of attack. The normal and axial force coefﬁcients are 1.2 and 0.03, respectively. Calculate the lift and dragcoefﬁcients. 1.6Consider an NACA 2412 airfoil (the meaning of the number designationsfor standard NACA airfoil shapes is discussed in Chapter 4). Thefollowing is a tabulation of the lift, drag, and moment coefﬁcients aboutthe quarter chord for this airfoil, as a function of angle of attack. α(degrees) cl cd cm,c/4 −2.0 0.05 0.006 −0.042 0 0.25 0.006 −0.040 2.0 0.44 0.006 −0.038 4.0 0.64 0.007 −0.036 6.0 0.85 0.0075 −0.036 8.0 1.08 0.0092 −0.036 10.0 1.26 0.0115 −0.034 12.0 1.43 0.0150 −0.030 14.0 1.56 0.0186 −0.025 From this table, plot on graph paper the variation of xcp/cas a function ofα. 1.7The drag on the hull of a ship depends in part on the height of the waterwaves produced by the hull. The potential energy associated with thesewaves therefore depends on the acceleration of gravity g. Hence, we can state that the wave drag on the hull is D=f(ρ ∞,V∞,c,g)where cis a length scale associated with the hull, say, the maximum width of the hull.Deﬁne the drag coefﬁcient as C D≡D/q∞c2. Also, deﬁne a similarity parameter called the Froude number, Fr=V/√gc. Using Buckingham’s pi theorem, prove that CD=f(Fr). 1.8The shock waves on a vehicle in supersonic ﬂight cause a component ofdrag called supersonic wave drag D w. Deﬁne the wave-drag coefﬁcient as CD,w=Dw/q∞S, where Sis a suitable reference area for the body. In supersonic ﬂight, the ﬂow is governed in part by its thermodynamicproperties, given by the speciﬁc heats at constant pressure c pand at constant volume cv. Deﬁne the ratio cp/cv≡γ. Using Buckingham’s pi theorem, show that CD,w=f(M∞,γ). Neglect the inﬂuence of friction.CHAPTER 1Aerodynamics: Some Introductory Thoughts 103 1.9Consider two different ﬂows over geometrically similar airfoil shapes, one airfoil being twice the size of the other. The ﬂow over the smallerairfoil has freestream properties given by T ∞=200 K, ρ∞=1.23 kg/m3, andV∞=100 m/s. The ﬂow over the larger airfoil is described by T∞=800 K, ρ∞=1.739 kg/m3, and V∞=200 m/s. Assume that bothμandaare proportional to T1/2. Are the two ﬂows dynamically similar? 1.10 Consider a Lear jet ﬂying at a velocity of 250 m/s at an altitude of 10 km,where the density and temperature are 0.414 kg/m 3and 223 K, respectively. Consider also a one-ﬁfth scale model of the Lear jet beingtested in a wind tunnel in the laboratory. The pressure in the test section ofthe wind tunnel is 1 atm =1.01×10 5N/m2. Calculate the necessary velocity, temperature, and density of the airﬂow in the wind-tunnel testsection such that the lift and drag coefﬁcients are the same for thewind-tunnel model and the actual airplane in ﬂight. Note: The relation among pressure, density, and temperature is given by the equation of statedescribed in Problem 1.1. 1.11 A U-tube mercury manometer is used to measure the pressure at a pointon the wing of a wind-tunnel model. One side of the manometer isconnected to the model, and the other side is open to the atmosphere.Atmospheric pressure and the density of liquid mercury are1.01×10 5N/m2and 1.36 ×104kg/m3, respectively. When the displacement of the two columns of mercury is 20 cm, with the highcolumn on the model side, what is the pressure on the wing? 1.12 The German Zeppelins of World War I were dirigibles with the followingtypical characteristics: volume =15,000 m 3and maximum diameter = 14.0 m. Consider a Zeppelin ﬂying at a velocity of 30 m/s at a standardaltitude of 1000 m (look up the corresponding density in Appendix D).The Zeppelin is at a small angle of attack such that its lift coefﬁcient is0.05 (based on the maximum cross-sectional area). The Zeppelin is ﬂyingin straight-and-level ﬂight with no acceleration. Calculate the total weightof the Zeppelin. 1.13 Consider a circular cylinder in a hypersonic ﬂow, with its axisperpendicular to the ﬂow. Let φbe the angle measured between radii drawn to the leading edge (the stagnation point) and to any arbitrary pointon the cylinder. The pressure coefﬁcient distribution along the cylindricalsurface is given by C p=2 cos2φfor 0≤φ≤π/2 and 3π/ 2≤φ≤2π andCp=0 forπ/2≤φ≤3π/2. Calculate the drag coefﬁcient for the cylinder, based on projected frontal area of the cylinder. 1.14 Derive Archimedes’ principle using a body of general shape. 1.15 Consider a light, single-engine, propeller-driven airplane similar to aCessna Skylane. The airplane weight is 2950 lb and the wing referencearea is 174 ft The drag coefﬁcient of the airplane CDis a function of the lift coefﬁcient CLfor reasons that are given in Chapter 5; this function for the given airplane is CD=0.025+0.054 C2 L.104 PART 1Fundamental Principles a. For a steady level ﬂight at sea level, where the ambient atmospheric density is 0.002377 slug/ft3, plot on a graph the variation of CL,CD, and the lift-to-drag ratio L/Dwith ﬂight velocity ranging between 70 ft/s and 250 ft/s. b. Make some observations about the variation of these quantities with velocity. 1.16 Consider a ﬂat plate at zero angle of attack in a hypersonic ﬂow at Mach 10 at standard sea level conditions. At a point 0.5 m downstream from theleading edge, the local shear stress at the wall is 282 N/m The gas temperature at the wall is equal to standard sea level temperature. At thispoint, calculate the velocity gradient at the wall normal to the wall. 1.17 Consider the Space Shuttle during its atmospheric entry at the end of amission in space. At the altitude where the Shuttle has slowed to Mach 9,the local heat transfer at a given point on the lower surface of the wing is0.03 MW/m Calculate the normal temperature gradient in the air at this point on the wall, assuming the gas temperature at the wall is equal to thestandard sea-level temperature. 1.18 The purpose of this problem is to give you a feel for the magnitude ofReynolds number appropriate to real airplanes in actual ﬂight. a. Consider the DC-3 shown in Figure 1.1. The wing root chord length (distance from the front to the back of the wing where the wing joinsthe fuselage) is 14.25 ft. Consider the DC-3 ﬂying at 200 miles perhour at sea level. Calculate the Reynolds number for the ﬂow over thewing root chord. (This is an important number, because as we will seelater, it governs the skin-friction drag over that portion of the wing.) b. Consider the F-22 shown in Figure 1.5, and also gracing the cover of this book. The chord length where the wing joins the center body is21.5 ft. Consider the airplane making a high-speed pass at a velocityof 1320 ft/s at sea level (Mach 1.2). Calculate the Reynolds number atthe wing root. 1.19 For the design of their gliders in 1900 and 1901, the Wright brothers usedthe Lilienthal Table given in Figure 1.65 for their aerodynamic data. Basedon these data, they chose a design angle of attack of 3 degrees, and madeall their calculations of size, weight, etc., based on this design angle ofattack. Why do you think they chose three degrees? Hint: From the table, calculate the ratio of lift to drag, L/D, at 3 degrees angle of attack, and compare this with the lift-to-drag ratio at other angles of attack.You might want to review the design box at the end of Section 1.8, especiallyFigure 1.36, for the importance of L/D. 1.20 Consider the existence of a forward-facing axial aerodynamic force on anairfoil, as discussed in Section 1.16. Can a forward-facing axial force exist ona ﬂat plate at an angle of attack in a ﬂow? Thoroughly explain your answer.CHAPTER 2 Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principlesand Equations There is so great a difference between a ﬂuid and a collection of solid particles that the laws of pressure and of equilibrium of ﬂuids are very different from thelaws of the pressure and equilibrium of solids. Jean Le Rond d’Alembert, 1768 The principle is most important, not the detail. Theodore von Karman, 1954 PREVIEW BOX Fundamental principles, equations, fundamental prin- ciples, equations. More fundamental principles. Moreequations. At ﬁrst thought, studying fundamentalprinciples and equations may not seem very exciting.But think again. Consider that you are participatingin the design and development of a new hypersonicvehicle. Such a vehicle is shown in Figure 2.1, theX-43A Hyper-X research vehicle. How do you goabout designing the aerodynamic shape of the newvehicle? Answer: By using fundamental principlesand equations. Consider the new Boeing 787 jet trans-port (Figure 2.2) speciﬁcally designed to obtain highaerodynamic and propulsive efﬁciency. How did the Figure 2.1 X-43A Hypersonic Experimental Vehicle—Artist Concept in Flight (NASA). 105106 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 2.2 Boeing 787 jet airliner. Boeing aerodynamicists ﬁrst come up with possible aerodynamic shapes for this airplane? Answer: By us-ing fundamental principles and equations. This chapter is all about fundamental principles and equations in aerodynamics. The material dis-cussed here is essential to the development of your un-derstanding and appreciation of aerodynamics. Studythis material with an open mind. Although this chap-ter is full of trees, see the forest as well. And thiswill not be the only chapter in which you will bestudying fundamental concepts and equations; as weprogress through this book, we will be expanding ourinventory of fundamental concepts and equations asnecessary to deal with the exciting engineering ap-plications presented in subsequent chapters. So viewyour study of this chapter as building your foundationin aerodynamics from which you can spring to a lot ofinteresting applications later on. With this mind set, Ipredict that you will ﬁnd this chapter to be intellectu-ally enjoyable. Central to this chapter is the derivation and dis- cussion of the three most important and fundamentalequations in aerodynamics: the continuity, momen-tum, and energy equations. The continuity equation isa mathematical statement of the fundamental princi-ple that mass is conserved. The momentum equation isa mathematical statement of Newton’s second law.The energy equation is a mathematical statement ofenergy conservation (i.e., the ﬁrst law of thermody-namics). Nothing in aerodynamics is more funda-mental than these three physical principles, and noequations in aerodynamics are more basic than thecontinuity, momentum, and energy equations. Makethese three equations and fundamental principlesyour constant companions as you travel through thisbook—indeed, as you travel through all your studyand work in aerodynamics, however far that may be. 2.1 INTRODUCTION AND ROAD MAP To be a good craftsperson, one must have good tools and must know how to use them effectively. Similarly, a good aerodynamicist must have good aerodynamictools and must know how to use them for a variety of applications. The purposeof this chapter is “tool-building”; we develop some of the concepts and equationsthat are vital to the study of aerodynamic ﬂows. However, please be cautioned:A craftsperson usually derives his or her pleasure from the works of art createdwith the useof the tools; the actual building of the tools themselves is sometimes considered a mundane chore. You may derive a similar feeling here. As we proceedto build our aerodynamic tools, you may wonder from time to time why such toolsare necessary and what possible value they may have in the solution of practicalproblems. Rest assured, however, that every aerodynamic tool we develop inthis and subsequent chapters is important for the analysis and understanding ofpractical problems to be discussed later. So, as we move through this chapter, donot get lost or disoriented; rather, as we develop each tool, simply put it away inthe store box of your mind for future use.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 107 Figure 2.3 Road map for Chapter 2. To help you keep track of our tool building, and to give you some orientation, the road map in Figure 2.3 is provided for your reference. As we progress through each section of this chapter, use Figure 2.3 to help you maintain a perspective ofour work. You will note that Figure 2.3 is full of strange-sounding terms, such as“substantial derivative,” “circulation,” and “velocity potential.” However, whenyou ﬁnish this chapter, and look back at Figure 2.3, all these terms will be secondnature to you. 2.2 REVIEW OF VECTOR RELATIONS Aerodynamics is full of quantities that have both magnitude and direction, suchas force and velocity. These are vector quantities, and as such, the mathematics of aerodynamics is most conveniently expressed in vector notation. The purpose108 PART 1Fundamental Principles of this section is to set forth the basic relations we need from vector algebra and vector calculus. If you are familiar with vector analysis, this section will serve asa concise review. If you are not conversant with vector analysis, this section willhelp you establish some vector notation, and will serve as a skeleton from whichyou can ﬁll in more information from the many existing texts on vector analysis(see, e.g., References 4 to 6). 2.2.1 Some Vector Algebra Consider a vector quantity A; both its magnitude and direction are given by the arrow labeled Ain Figure 2.4. The absolute magnitude of Ais|A|, and is a scalar quantity. The unit vector n, deﬁned by n=A/|A|, has a magnitude of unity and a direction equal to that of A. Let Brepresent another vector. The vector addition ofAandByields a third vector C, A+B=C (2.1) which is formed by connecting the tail of Awith the head of B, as shown in Figure 2.4. Now consider −B, which is equal in magnitude to B, but opposite in direction. The vector subtraction of BandAyields vector D, A−B=D (2.2) which is formed by connecting the tail of Awith the head of −B, as shown in Figure 2.4. There are two forms of vector multiplication. Consider two vectors Aand Bat an angle θto each other, as shown in Figure 2.4. The scalar product (dot product) of the two vectors AandBis deﬁned as A·B≡|A||B| cosθ (2.3) =magnitude of A×magnitude of the component of Balong the direction of A Figure 2.4 Vector diagrams.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 109 Note that the scalar product of two vectors is a scalar. In contrast, the vector product (cross product) of the two vectors AandBis deﬁned as A×B≡(|A||B| sinθ)e=G (2.4) where Gis perpendicular to the plane of AandBand in a direction which obeys the “right-hand rule.” (Rotate Ainto B, as shown in Figure 2.4. Now curl the ﬁngers of your right hand in the direction of the rotation. Your right thumb will be pointing in the direction of G.) In Equation (2.4), eis a unit vector in the direction ofG, as also shown in Figure 2.4. Note that the vector product of two vectors is a vector. 2.2.2 Typical Orthogonal Coordinate Systems To describe mathematically the ﬂow of ﬂuid through three-dimensional space, wehave to prescribe a three-dimensional coordinate system. The geometry of someaerodynamic problems best ﬁts a rectangular space, whereas others are mainlycylindrical in nature, and yet others may have spherical properties. Therefore, wehave interest in the three most common orthogonal coordinate systems: cartesian,cylindrical, and spherical. These systems are described below. (An orthogonalcoordinate system is one where all three coordinate directions are mutually per-pendicular. It is interesting to note that some modern numerical solutions ofﬂuid ﬂows utilize nonorthogonal coordinate spaces; moreover, for some numer-ical problems the coordinate system is allowed to evolve and change during thecourse of the solution. These so-called adaptive grid techniques are beyond thescope of this book. See Reference 7 for details.) Acartesian coordinate system is shown in Figure 2.5a. The x,y, and zaxes are mutually perpendicular, and i,j, and kare unit vectors in the x,y, and z directions, respectively. An arbitrary point Pin space is located by specifying the Figure 2.5 Cartesian coordinates.110 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 2.6 Cylindrical coordinates. three coordinates (x,y,z). The point can also be located by the position vector r, where r=xi+yj+zk IfAis a given vector in cartesian space, it can be expressed as A=Axi+Ayj+Azk where Ax,Ay, and Azare the scalar components of Aalong the x,y, and z directions, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.5b. Acylindrical coordinate system is shown in Figure 2.6a. A “phantom” carte- sian system is also shown with dashed lines to help visualize the ﬁgure. The location of point Pin space is given by three coordinates (r,θ,z), where randθ are measured in the xyplane shown in Figure 2.6a. The rcoordinate direction is the direction of increasing r, holding θandzconstant; eris the unit vector in the rdirection. The θcoordinate direction is the direction of increasing θ, holding r andzconstant; eθis the unit vector in the θdirection. The zcoordinate direction is the direction of increasing z, holding randθconstant; ezis the unit vector in thezdirection. If Ais a given vector in cylindrical space, then A=Arer+Aθeθ+Azez where Ar,Aθ, and Azare the scalar components of Aalong the r,θ, and zdirec- tions, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.6b. The relationship, or transformation, between cartesian and cylindrical coordinates can be obtained from inspection ofFigure 2.6a, namely, x=rcosθ y=rsinθ (2.5) z=zCHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 111 Figure 2.7 Spherical coordinates. or inversely, r=/radicalbig x2+y2 θ=arctany x(2.6) z=z Aspherical coordinate system is shown in Figure 2.7a. Once again, a phantom cartesian system is shown with dashed lines. (However, for clarity in the picture, thezaxis is drawn vertically, in contrast to Figures 2.5 and 2.6.) The location of point Pin space is given by the three coordinates (r,θ,/Phi1 ) , where ris the distance of Pfrom the origin, θis the angle measured from the zaxis and is in therzplane, and /Phi1is the angle measured from the xaxis and is in the xyplane. The rcoordinate direction is the direction of increasing r, holding θand/Phi1 constant; eris the unit vector in the rdirection. The θcoordinate direction is the direction of increasing θ, holding rand/Phi1constant; eθis the unit vector in the θdirection. The /Phi1coordinate direction is the direction of increasing /Phi1, holding randθconstant; e/Phi1is the unit vector in the /Phi1direction. The unit vectors er, eθ, and e/Phi1are mutually perpendicular. If Ais a given vector in spherical space, then A=Arer+Aθeθ+A/Phi1e/Phi1 where Ar,Aθ, and A/Phi1are the scalar components of Aalong the r,θ, and/Phi1 directions, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.7b. The transformation betweencartesian and spherical coordinates is obtained from inspection of Figure 2.7a,112 PART 1Fundamental Principles namely, x=rsinθcos/Phi1 y=rsinθsin/Phi1 (2.7) z=rcosθ or inversely, r=/radicalbig x2+y2+z2 θ=arccosz r=arccosz/radicalbig x2+y2+z2(2.8) /Phi1=arccosx/radicalbig x2+y2 2.2.3 Scalar and Vector Fields A scalar quantity given as a function of coordinate space and time tis called a scalar ﬁeld. For example, pressure, density, and temperature are scalar quantities, and p=p1(x,y,z,t)=p2(r,θ,z,t)=p3(r,θ,/Phi1 ,t ) ρ=ρ1(x,y,z,t)=ρ2(r,θ,z,t)=ρ3(r,θ,/Phi1 ,t ) T=T1(x,y,z,t)=T2(r,θ,z,t)=T3(r,θ,/Phi1 ,t ) are scalar ﬁelds for pressure, density, and temperature, respectively. Similarly, avector quantity given as a function of coordinate space and time is called a vector ﬁeld. For example, velocity is a vector quantity, and V=V xi+Vyj+Vzk where Vx=Vx(x,y,z,t) Vy=Vy(x,y,z,t) Vz=Vz(x,y,z,t) is the vector ﬁeld for Vin cartesian space. Analogous expressions can be written for vector ﬁelds in cylindrical and spherical space. In many theoretical aero-dynamic problems, the above scalar and vector ﬁelds are the unknowns to beobtained in a solution for a ﬂow with prescribed initial and boundary conditions. 2.2.4 Scalar and Vector Products The scalar and vector products deﬁned by Equations (2.3) and (2.4), respectively,can be written in terms of the components of each vector as follows. Cartesian Coordinates Let A=A xi+Ayj+Azk and B=Bxi+Byj+Bzk Then A·B=AxBx+AyBy+AzBz (2.9)CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 113 and A×B=⎡ ⎣i jk AxAyAz BxByBz⎤⎦ =i(AyBz−AzBy)+j(AzBx−AxBz) (2.10)+k(AxBy−AyBx) Cylindrical Coordinates Let A=Arer+Aθeθ+Azez and B=Brer+Bθeθ+Bzez Then A·B=ArBr+AθBθ+AzBz (2.11) and A×B=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleereθez ArAθAz BrBθBz/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle (2.12) Spherical Coordinates Let A=Arer+Aθeθ+A/Phi1e/Phi1 and B=Brer+Bθeθ+B/Phi1e/Phi1 Then A·B=ArBr+AθBθ+A/Phi1B/Phi1 (2.13) and A×B=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleereθe/Phi1 ArAθA/Phi1 BrBθB/Phi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle (2.14) 2.2.5 Gradient of a Scalar Field We now begin a review of some elements of vector calculus. Consider a scalar ﬁeld p=p1(x,y,z)=p2(r,θ,z)=p3(r,θ,/Phi1 ) Thegradient ofp,∇p, at a given point in space is deﬁned as a vector such that: 1.Its magnitude is the maximum rate of change of pper unit length of the coordinate space at the given point. 2.Its direction is that of the maximum rate of change of pat the given point. For example, consider a two-dimensional pressure ﬁeld in cartesian space assketched in Figure 2.8. The solid curves are lines of constant pressure (i.e., theyconnect points in the pressure ﬁeld which have the same value of p). Such lines are called isolines. Consider an arbitrary point (x,y)in Figure 2.8. If we move away from this point in an arbitrary direction, pwill, in general, change because we are moving to another location in space. Moreover, there will be some di-rection from this point along which pchanges the most over a unit length in that direction. This deﬁnes the direction of the gradient ofpand is identiﬁed in Figure 2.8. The magnitude of ∇pis the rate of change of pper unit length in that114 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 2.8 Illustration of the gradient of a scalar ﬁeld. Figure 2.9 Sketch for the directional derivative. direction. Both the magnitude and direction of ∇pwill change from one point to another in the coordinate space. A line drawn in this space along which ∇p is tangent at every point is deﬁned as a gradient line, as sketched in Figure 2.8. The gradient line and isoline through any given point in the coordinate space are perpendicular. Consider ∇pat a given point (x,y)as shown in Figure 2.9. Choose some arbitrary direction saway from the point, as also shown in Figure 2.9. Let nbe a unit vector in the sdirection. The rate of change of pper unit length in the s direction is dp ds=∇ p·n (2.15) In Equation (2.15), dp/dsis called the directional derivative in the sdirection. Note from Equation (2.15) that the rate of change of pin any arbitrary direction is simply the component of ∇pin that direction. Expressions for ∇pin the different coordinate systems are given below: Cartesian: p=p(x,y,z) ∇p=∂p ∂xi+∂p ∂yj+∂p ∂zk (2.16)CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 115 Cylindrical: p=p(r,θ,z) ∇p=∂p ∂rer+1 r∂p ∂θeθ+∂p ∂zez (2.17) Spherical: p=p(r,θ,/Phi1 ) ∇p=∂p ∂rer+1 r∂p ∂θeθ+1 rsinθ∂p ∂/Phi1e/Phi1 (2.18) 2.2.6 Divergence of a Vector Field Consider a vector ﬁeld V=V(x,y,z)=V(r,θ,z)=V(r,θ,/Phi1 ) In the above, Vcan represent any vector quantity. However, for practical purposes, and to aid in physical interpretation, consider Vto be the ﬂow velocity. Also, visualize a small ﬂuid element of ﬁxed mass moving along a streamline with velocity V. As the ﬂuid element moves through space, its volume will, in general, change. In Section 2.3, we prove that the time rate of change of the volume ofa moving ﬂuid element of ﬁxed mass, per unit volume of that element, is equalto the divergence ofV, denoted by ∇·V. The divergence of a vector is a scalar quantity; it is one of two ways that the derivative of a vector ﬁeld can be deﬁned.In different coordinate systems, we have Cartesian: V=V(x,y,z)=V xi+Vyj+Vzk ∇·V=∂Vx ∂x+∂Vy ∂y+∂Vz ∂z(2.19) Cylindrical: V=V(r,θ,z)=Vrer+Vθeθ+Vzez ∇·V=1 r∂ ∂r(rVr)+1 r∂Vθ ∂θ+∂Vz ∂z(2.20) Spherical: V=V(r,θ,/Phi1 ) =Vrer+Vθeθ+V/Phi1e/Phi1 ∇·V=1 r2∂ ∂r(r2Vr)+1 rsinθ∂ ∂θ(Vθsinθ)+1 rsinθ∂V/Phi1 ∂/Phi1(2.21)116 PART 1Fundamental Principles 2.2.7 Curl of a Vector Field Consider a vector ﬁeld V=V(x,y,z)=V(r,θ,z)=V(r,θ,/Phi1 ) Although Vcan be any vector quantity, again consider Vto be the ﬂow velocity. Once again visualize a ﬂuid element moving along a streamline. It is possible for this ﬂuid element to be rotating with an angular velocity ωas it translates along the streamline.

Make certain to re-view these tools until you feel comfortable with them, especially the relationsin boxes. 2.3 MODELS OF THE FLUID: CONTROL VOLUMES AND FLUID ELEMENTS Aerodynamics is a fundamental science, steeped in physical observation. As youproceed through this book, make every effort to gradually develop a “physi-cal feel” for the material. An important virtue of all successful aerodynamicists(indeed, of all successful engineers and scientists) is that they have good “physicalintuition,” based on thought and experience, which allows them to make reason-able judgments on difﬁcult problems. Although this chapter is full of equationsand (seemingly) esoteric concepts, now is the time for you to start developing thisphysical feel. With this section, we begin to build the basic equations of aerodynamics. There is a certain philosophical procedure involved with the development of120 PART 1Fundamental Principles these equations, as follows: 1.Invoke three fundamental physical principles that are deeply entrenched in our macroscopic observations of nature, namely, a.Mass is conserved (i.e., mass can be neither created nor destroyed). b.Newton’s second law: force =mass×acceleration. c.Energy is conserved; it can only change from one form to another. 2.Determine a suitable model of the ﬂuid. Remember that a ﬂuid is a squishy substance, and therefore it is usually more difﬁcult to describe than awell-deﬁned solid body. Hence, we have to adopt a reasonable model of theﬂuid to which we can apply the fundamental principles stated in item 1. 3.Apply the fundamental physical principles listed in item 1 to the model ofthe ﬂuid determined in item 2 in order to obtain mathematical equationswhich properly describe the physics of the ﬂow. In turn, use thesefundamental equations to analyze any particular aerodynamic ﬂow problemof interest. In this section, we concentrate on item 2; namely, we ask the question: What is a suitable model of the ﬂuid? How do we visualize this squishy substance in order to apply the three fundamental physical principles to it? There is no singleanswer to this question; rather, three different models have been used successfullythroughout the modern evolution of aerodynamics. They are (1) ﬁnite controlvolume, (2) inﬁnitesimal ﬂuid element, and (3) molecular. Let us examine whatthese models involve and how they are applied. 2.3.1 Finite Control Volume Approach Consider a general ﬂow ﬁeld as represented by the streamlines in Figure 2.13. Letus imagine a closed volume drawn within a ﬁnite region of the ﬂow. This volume Figure 2.13 Finite control volume approach.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 121 deﬁnes a control volume V, and a control surface S is deﬁned as the closed surface which bounds the control volume. The control volume may be ﬁxed in space with the ﬂuid moving through it, as shown at the left of Figure 2.13. Alternatively, thecontrol volume may be moving with the ﬂuid such that the same ﬂuid particlesare always inside it, as shown at the right of Figure 2.13. In either case, the controlvolume is a reasonably large, ﬁnite region of the ﬂow. The fundamental physicalprinciples are applied to the ﬂuid inside the control volume, and to the ﬂuidcrossing the control surface (if the control volume is ﬁxed in space). Therefore,instead of looking at the whole ﬂow ﬁeld at once, with the control volume modelwe limit our attention to just the ﬂuid in the ﬁnite region of the volume itself. 2.3.2 Inﬁnitesimal Fluid Element Approach Consider a general ﬂow ﬁeld as represented by the streamlines in Figure 2.14. Letus imagine an inﬁnitesimally small ﬂuid element in the ﬂow, with a differentialvolume dV. The ﬂuid element is inﬁnitesimal in the same sense as differential calculus; however, it is large enough to contain a huge number of molecules so thatit can be viewed as a continuous medium. The ﬂuid element may be ﬁxed in spacewith the ﬂuid moving through it, as shown at the left of Figure 2.14. Alternatively,it may be moving along a streamline with velocity Vequal to the ﬂow velocity at each point. Again, instead of looking at the whole ﬂow ﬁeld at once, thefundamental physical principles are applied to just the ﬂuid element itself. 2.3.3 Molecular Approach In actuality, of course, the motion of a ﬂuid is a ramiﬁcation of the mean motion ofits atoms and molecules. Therefore, a third model of the ﬂow can be a microscopicapproach wherein the fundamental laws of nature are applied directly to the atomsand molecules, using suitable statistical averaging to deﬁne the resulting ﬂuidproperties. This approach is in the purview of kinetic theory, which is a very Figure 2.14 Inﬁnitesimal ﬂuid element approach.122 PART 1Fundamental Principles elegant method with many advantages in the long run. However, it is beyond the scope of the present book. In summary, although many variations on the theme can be found in different texts for the derivation of the general equations of ﬂuid ﬂow, the ﬂow model canusually be categorized under one of the approaches described above. 2.3.4 Physical Meaning of the Divergence of Velocity In the equations to follow, the divergence of velocity, ∇·V, occurs frequently. Before leaving this section, let us prove the statement made earlier (Section 2.2)that∇·Vis physically the time rate of change of the volume of a moving ﬂuid element of ﬁxed mass per unit volume of that element. Consider a control volumemoving with the ﬂuid (the case shown on the right of Figure 2.13). This controlvolume is always made up of the same ﬂuid particles as it moves with the ﬂow;hence, its mass is ﬁxed, invariant with time. However, its volume Vand control surface Sare changing with time as it moves to different regions of the ﬂow where different values of ρexist. That is, this moving control volume of ﬁxed mass is constantly increasing or decreasing its volume and is changing its shape,depending on the characteristics of the ﬂow. This control volume is shown inFigure 2.15 at some instant in time. Consider an inﬁnitesimal element of thesurface dSmoving at the local velocity V, as shown in Figure 2.15. The change in the volume of the control volume /Delta1V, due to just the movement of dSover a time increment /Delta1t, is, from Figure 2.15, equal to the volume of the long, thin cylinder with base area dSand altitude (V/Delta1t)·n; that is, /Delta1V=[(V/Delta1t )·n]dS=(V/Delta1t)·dS (2.28) Over the time increment /Delta1t, the total change in volume of the whole control volume is equal to the summation of Equation (2.28) over the total controlsurface. In the limit as dS→0, the sum becomes the surface integral ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(V/Delta1t)·dS Figure 2.15 Moving control volume used for the physical interpretation of the divergence of velocity.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 123 If this integral is divided by /Delta1t, the result is physically the time rate of change of the control volume, denoted by DV/Dt; that is, DV Dt=1 /Delta1t................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(V/Delta1t)·dS=................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SV·dS (2.29) (The signiﬁcance of the notation D/Dtis revealed in Section 2.9.) Applying the divergence theorem, Equation (2.26), to the right side of Equation (2.29), we have DV Dt=......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay V(∇ ·V)dV (2.30) Now let us imagine that the moving control volume in Figure 2.15 is shrunk to a very small volume δV, essentially becoming an inﬁnitesimal moving ﬂuid element as sketched on the right of Figure 2.14. Then Equation (2.30) can bewritten as D(δV) Dt=......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay δV(∇ ·V)dV (2.31) Assume that δVis small enough such that ∇·Vis essentially the same value throughout δV. Then the integral in Equation (2.31) can be approximated as (∇ ·V)δV. From Equation (2.31), we have D(δV) Dt=(∇ ·V)δV or ∇·V=1 δVD(δV) Dt(2.32) Examine Equation (2.32). It states that ∇·Vis physically the time rate of change of the volume of a moving ﬂuid element, per unit volume. Hence, the interpretation of∇·V, ﬁrst given in Section 2.2.6, Divergence of a Vector Field, is now proved. 2.3.5 Speciﬁcation of the Flow Field In Section 2.2.3 we deﬁned both scalar and vector ﬁelds. We now apply this con- cept of a ﬁeld more directly to an aerodynamic ﬂow. One of the most straightfor-ward ways of describing the details of an aerodynamic ﬂow is simply to visualizethe ﬂow in three-dimensional space, and to write the variation of the aerodynamicproperties as a function of space and time. For example, in cartesian coordinatesthe equations p=p(x,y,z,t) (2.33a) ρ=ρ(x,y,z,t) (2.33b) T=T(x,y,z,t) (2.33c) and V=ui+vj+wk (2.34a)124 PART 1Fundamental Principles where u=u(x,y,z,t) (2.34b) v=v(x,y,z,t) (2.34c) w=w(x,y,z,t) (2.34d) represent the ﬂow ﬁeld. Equations (2.33 a–c) give the variation of the scalar ﬂow ﬁeld variables pressure, density, and temperature, respectively. (In equilibrium thermodynamics, the speciﬁcation of two state variables, such as pandρ, uniquely deﬁnes the values of all other state variables, such as T. In this case, one of Equations (2.33) can be considered redundant.) Equations (2.34 a–d) give the variation of the vector ﬂow ﬁeld variable velocity V, where the scalar components ofVin the x,y, and zdirections are u,v, andw, respectively. Figure 2.16 illustrates a given ﬂuid element moving in a ﬂow ﬁeld speciﬁed by Equations (2.33) and (2.34). At the time t1, the ﬂuid element is at point 1, located at (x1,y1,z1)as shown in Figure 2.16. At this instant, its velocity is V1and its pressure is given by p=p(x1,y1,z1,t1) and similarly for its other ﬂow variables. By deﬁnition, an unsteady ﬂow is one where the ﬂow ﬁeld variables at any given point are changing with time. For example, if you lock your eyes on point 1in Figure 2.16, and keep them ﬁxed on point 1, if the ﬂow is unsteady you will y y1 z1x1V1 x zPoint 1Flow Field p = p ( x, y, z , t) /H9267 = /H9267 ( x, y, z , t) T = T ( x, y, z , t) V = ui + vj + w k u = u ( x, y, z , t) v = v ( x, y, z , t) w = w ( x, y, z , t) Figure 2.16 A ﬂuid element passing through point 1 in a ﬂow ﬁeld.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 125 observe p,ρ, etc., ﬂuctuating with time. Equations (2.33) and (2.34) describe an unsteady ﬂow ﬁeld because time tis included as one of the independent variables. In contrast, a steady ﬂow is one where the ﬂow ﬁeld variables at any given point are invariant with time, that is, if you lock your eyes on point 1 you will continuously observe the same constant values for p,ρ,V,etc., for all time. A steady ﬂow ﬁeld is speciﬁed by the relations p=p(x,y,z) ρ=ρ(x,y,z) etc. The concept of the ﬂow ﬁeld, and a speciﬁed ﬂuid element moving through it as illustrated in Figure 2.16, will be revisited in Section 2.9 where we deﬁneand discuss the concept of the substantial derivative. EXAMPLE 2.1 The subsonic compressible ﬂow over a cosine-shaped (wavy) wall is illustrated in Fig- ure 2.17. The wavelength and amplitude of the wall are landh, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.17. The streamlines exhibit the same qualitative shape as the wall, but withdiminishing amplitude as distance above the wall increases.

Also, consider a ﬂuid element of ﬁxed mass moving along a streamline in the ﬂow ﬁeld. The ﬂuid element passes through the point (x//lscript,y//lscript)=(1 4,1). At this point, calculate the time rate of change of the volume of the ﬂuid element, per unitvolume. ■Solution From Section 2.3.4, we know that the time rate of change of the volume of a moving ﬂuidelement of ﬁxed mass, per unit volume, is given by the divergence of the velocity ∇·V. In cartesian coordinates, from Equation (2.19), we have ∇·V=∂u ∂x+∂v ∂y(2.37) From Equation (2.35), ∂u ∂x=−V∞h β/parenleftbigg2π /lscript/parenrightbigg2/parenleftbigg sin2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript(2.38) and from Equation (2.36), ∂v ∂y=+V∞h/parenleftbigg2π /lscript/parenrightbigg2 β/parenleftbigg sin2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript(2.39) Substituting Equation (2.38) and (2.39) into (2.37), we have ∇·V=/parenleftbigg β−1 β/parenrightbigg V∞h/parenleftbigg2π /lscript/parenrightbigg2/parenleftbigg sin2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript(2.40) Evaluating Equation (2.40) at the point x//lscript=1 4andy//lscript=1, ∇·V=/parenleftbigg β−1 β/parenrightbigg V∞h/parenleftbigg2π /lscript/parenrightbigg2 e−2πβ(2.41) Equation (2.41) gives the time rate of change of the volume of the ﬂuid element, per unitvolume, as it passes through the point (x//lscript,y//lscript)=( 1 4,1). Note that it is a ﬁnite (nonzero) value; the volume of the ﬂuid element is changing as it moves along the streamline. ThisCHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 127 is consistent with the deﬁnition of a compressible ﬂow, where the density is a variable and hence the volume of a ﬁxed mass must also be variable. Note from Equation (2.40)that∇·V=0 only along vertical lines denoted by x//lscript=0, 1 2,1, 11 2,... , where the sin(2π x//lscript)goes to zero. This is a peculiarity associated with the cyclical nature of the ﬂow ﬁeld over the cosine-shaped wall. For the particular ﬂow considered here,where /lscript=1.0 m, h=0.01 m, V ∞=240 m/s, and M∞=0.7, where β=/radicalBig 1−M2∞=/radicalbig 1−(0.7)2=0.714 Equation (2.41) yields ∇·V=/parenleftbigg 0.714−1 0.714/parenrightbigg (240)(0.01)/parenleftbigg2π 1/parenrightbigg e−2π( 0.714)=−0.7327 s−1 The physical signiﬁcance of this result is that, as the ﬂuid element is passing through thepoint( 1 4,1)in the ﬂow, it is experiencing a 73 percent rate of decrease of volume per second (the negative quantity denotes a decrease in volume). That is, the density of the ﬂuidelement is increasing. Hence, the point ( 1 4,1)is in a compression region of the ﬂow, where the ﬂuid element will experience an increase in density. Expansion regions are deﬁned byvalues of x//lscriptwhich yield negative values of the sine function in Equation (2.40), which in turn yields a positive value for ∇·V. This gives an increase in volume of the ﬂuid element, hence a decrease in density. Clearly, as the ﬂuid element continues its path through thisﬂow ﬁeld, it experiences cyclical increases and decreases in density, as well as the otherﬂow ﬁeld properties. 2.4 CONTINUITY EQUATION In Section 2.3, we discussed several models which can be used to study the motion of a ﬂuid. Following the philosophy set forth at the beginning of Section 2.3, wenow apply the fundamental physical principles to such models. Unlike the abovederivation of the physical signiﬁcance of ∇·Vwherein we used the model of a moving ﬁnite control volume, we now employ the model of a ﬁxed ﬁnite control volume as sketched on the left side of Figure 2.13. Here, the control volume isﬁxed in space, with the ﬂow moving through it. Unlike our previous derivation,the volume Vand control surface Sare now constant with time, and the mass of ﬂuid contained within the control volume can change as a function of time (dueto unsteady ﬂuctuations of the ﬂow ﬁeld). Before starting the derivation of the fundamental equations of aerodynamics, we must examine a concept vital to those equations, namely, the concept of mass ﬂow. Consider a given area Aarbitrarily oriented in a ﬂow ﬁeld as shown in Figure 2.18. In Figure 2.18, we are looking at an edge view of area A. Let A be small enough such that the ﬂow velocity Vis uniform across A. Consider the ﬂuid elements with velocity Vthat pass through A. In time dtafter crossing A, they have moved a distance V dt and have swept out the shaded volume shown in Figure 2.18. This volume is equal to the base area Atimes the height of the128 PART 1Fundamental Principles V V dtVn dt A (edge view) Figure 2.18 Sketch for discussion of mass ﬂow through area Ain a ﬂow ﬁeld. cylinder Vndt, where Vnis the component of velocity normal to A; that is, V olume =(Vndt)A The mass inside the shaded volume is therefore Mass=ρ(Vndt)A (2.42) This is the mass that has swept past Ain time dt. By deﬁnition, the mass ﬂow through Ais the mass crossing Aper second (e.g., kilograms per second, slugs per second). Let ˙mdenote mass ﬂow. From Equation (2.42), ˙m=ρ(Vndt)A dt or ˙m=ρVnA (2.43) Equation (2.43) demonstrates that mass ﬂow through Ais given by the product Area×density ×component of ﬂow velocity normal to the area A related concept is that of mass ﬂux, deﬁned as the mass ﬂow per unit area. Mass ﬂux =˙m A=ρVn (2.44) Typical units of mass ﬂux are kg/(s ·m2) and slug/(s ·ft2). The concepts of mass ﬂow and mass ﬂux are important. Note from Equa- tion (2.44) that mass ﬂux across a surface is equal to the product of density times the component of velocity perpendicular to the surface. Many of the equations ofaerodynamics involve products of density and velocity. For example, in cartesiancoordinates, V=V xi+Vyj+Vzk=ui+vj+wk, where u,v, andwdenote thex,y, and zcomponents of velocity, respectively. (The use of u,v, andw rather than Vx,Vy, and Vzto symbolize the x,y, and zcomponents of velocity is quite common in aerodynamic literature; we henceforth adopt the u,v, andw notation.) In many of the equations of aerodynamics, you will ﬁnd the productsρu,ρv, andρw; always remember that these products are the mass ﬂuxes in theCHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 129 Figure 2.19 Finite control volume ﬁxed in space. x,y, and zdirections, respectively. In a more general sense, if Vis the magnitude of velocity in an arbitrary direction, the product ρVis physically the mass ﬂux (mass ﬂow per unit area) across an area oriented perpendicular to the direction ofV. We are now ready to apply our ﬁrst physical principle to a ﬁnite control volume ﬁxed in space. Physical principle Mass can be neither created nor destroyed. Consider a ﬂow ﬁeld wherein all properties vary with spatial location and time, for example, ρ=ρ(x,y,z,t). In this ﬂow ﬁeld, consider the ﬁxed ﬁnite control volume shown in Figure 2.19. At a point on the control surface, the ﬂowvelocity is Vand the vector elemental surface area is dS. Also dVis an elemental volume inside the control volume. Applied to this control volume, the abovephysical principle means Net mass ﬂow outof control time rate of decrease of=volume through surface S mass inside control volume V(2.45a) or B=C (2.45b) where BandCare just convenient symbols for the left and right sides, respectively, of Equation (2.45 a). First, let us obtain an expression for Bin terms of the quantities shown in Figure 2.19. From Equation (2.43), the elemental mass ﬂowacross the area dSis ρV ndS=ρV·dS Examining Figure 2.19, note that by convention, dSalways points in a direction outof the control volume. Hence, when Valso points out of the control volume (as shown in Figure 2.19), the product ρV·dSispositive. Moreover, when V points out of the control volume, the mass ﬂow is physically leaving the controlvolume (i.e., it is an outﬂow). Hence, a positive ρV·dSdenotes an outﬂow. In turn, when Vpoints into the control volume, ρV·dSisnegative. Moreover, when Vpoints inward, the mass ﬂow is physically entering the control volume (i.e., it is an inﬂow). Hence, a negative ρV·dSdenotes an inﬂow. The netmass ﬂow outof the entire control surface Sis the summation over Sof the elemental mass130 PART 1Fundamental Principles ﬂows. In the limit, this becomes a surface integral, which is physically the left side of Equations (2.45 aandb); that is, B=................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SρV·dS (2.46) Now consider the right side of Equations (2.45 aandb).

Equation (2.48) iscalled the continuity equation. It is one of the most fundamental equations of ﬂuid dynamics. Note that Equation (2.48) expresses the continuity equation in integral form. We will have numerous opportunities to use this form; it has the advantage ofrelating aerodynamic phenomena over a ﬁnite region of space without beingconcerned about the details of precisely what is happening at a given distinctpoint in the ﬂow. On the other hand, there are many times when we are concernedwith the details of a ﬂow and we want to have equations that relate ﬂow propertiesat agiven point. In such a case, the integral form as expressed in Equation (2.48) is not particularly useful. However, Equation (2.48) can be reduced to another formthat does relate ﬂow properties at a given point, as follows. To begin with, sincethe control volume used to obtain Equation (2.48) is ﬁxed in space, the limitsCHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 131 of integration are also ﬁxed. Hence, the time derivative can be placed inside the volume integral and Equation (2.48) can be written as ......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay V∂ρ ∂tdV+................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SρV·dS=0 (2.49) Applying the divergence theorem, Equation (2.26), we can express the right-hand term of Equation (2.49) as ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV)·dS=......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay V∇·(ρV)dV (2.50) Substituting Equation (2.50) into (2.49), we obtain ......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay V∂ρ ∂tdV+......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay V∇·(ρV)dV=0 or......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay V/bracketleftbigg∂ρ ∂t+∇ ·(ρV)/bracketrightbigg dV=0 (2.51) Examine the integrand of Equation (2.51). If the integrand were a ﬁnite number, then Equation (2.51) would require that the integral over part of the control volumebe equal and opposite in sign to the integral over the remainder of the controlvolume, such that the net integration would be zero. However, the ﬁnite controlvolume is arbitrarily drawn in space; there is no reason to expect cancellation of one region by the other. Hence, the only way for the integral in Equation (2.51)to be zero for an arbitrary control volume is for the integrand to be zero at all points within the control volume. Thus, from Equation (2.51), we have ∂ρ ∂t+∇ ·(ρV)=0 (2.52) Equation (2.52) is the continuity equation in the form of a partial differentialequation. This equation relates the ﬂow ﬁeld variables at a point in the ﬂow, as opposed to Equation (2.48), which deals with a ﬁnite space. It is important to keep in mind that Equations (2.48) and (2.52) are equally valid statements of the physical principle of conservation of mass. They are math-ematical representations, but always remember that they speak words—they saythat mass can be neither created nor destroyed. Note that in the derivation of the above equations, the only assumption about the nature of the ﬂuid is that it is a continuum. Therefore, Equations (2.48) and(2.52) hold in general for the three-dimensional, unsteady ﬂow of any type ofﬂuid, inviscid or viscous, compressible or incompressible. (Note: It is important to keep track of all assumptions that are used in the derivation of any equationbecause they tell you the limitations on the ﬁnal result, and therefore prevent youfrom using an equation for a situation in which it is not valid. In all our futurederivations, develop the habit of noting all assumptions that go with the resultingequations.)132 PART 1Fundamental Principles It is important to emphasize the difference between unsteady and steady ﬂows. In an unsteady ﬂow, the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables are a function of both spatial location and time, for example, ρ=ρ(x,y,z,t) This means that if you lock your eyes on one ﬁxed point in space, the density at that point will change with time. Such unsteady ﬂuctuations can be causedby time-varying boundaries (e.g., an airfoil pitching up and down with time orthe supply valves of a wind tunnel being turned off and on). Equations (2.48)and (2.52) hold for such unsteady ﬂows. On the other hand, the vast majority ofpractical aerodynamic problems involve steady ﬂow. Here, the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables are a function of spatial location only, for example, ρ=ρ(x,y,z) This means that if you lock your eyes on a ﬁxed point in space, the density at thatpoint will be a ﬁxed value, invariant with time. For steady ﬂow, ∂/∂t=0, and hence Equations (2.48) and (2.52) reduce to ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SρV·dS=0 (2.53) and ∇·(ρV)=0 (2.54) 2.5 MOMENTUM EQUATION Newton’s second law is frequently written as F=ma (2.55) where Fis the force exerted on a body of mass mandais the acceleration. However, a more general form of Equation (2.55) is F=d dt(mV) (2.56) which reduces to Equation (2.55) for a body of constant mass. In Equation (2.56),mVis the momentum of a body of mass m. Equation (2.56) represents the second fundamental principle upon which theoretical ﬂuid dynamics is based. Physical principle Force =time rate of change of momentum We will apply this principle [in the form of Equation (2.56)] to the model of aﬁnite control volume ﬁxed in space as sketched in Figure 2.19. Our objective isto obtain expressions for both the left and right sides of Equation (2.56) in termsof the familiar ﬂow-ﬁeld variables p,ρ,V, etc. First, let us concentrate on the leftCHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 133 side of Equation (2.56) (i.e., obtain an expression for F, which is the force exerted on the ﬂuid as it ﬂows through the control volume). This force comes from two sources: 1.Body forces: gravity, electromagnetic forces, or any other forces which “act at a distance” on the ﬂuid inside V. 2.Surface forces: pressure and shear stress acting on the control surface S. Letfrepresent the net body force per unit mass exerted on the ﬂuid inside V. The body force on the elemental volume dVin Figure 2.19 is therefore ρfdV and the total body force exerted on the ﬂuid in the control volume is the summation of the above over the volume V: Body force =......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay VρfdV (2.57) The elemental surface force due to pressure acting on the element of area dSis −pdS where the negative sign indicates that the force is in the direction opposite of dS. That is, the control surface is experiencing a pressure force that is directed into the control volume and which is due to the pressure from the surroundings, andexamination of Figure 2.19 shows that such an inward-directed force is in thedirection opposite of dS. The complete pressure force is the summation of the elemental forces over the entire control surface: Pressure force =− ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SpdS (2.58) In a viscous ﬂow, the shear and normal viscous stresses also exert a surface force.A detailed evaluation of these viscous stresses is not warranted at this stage ofour discussion. Let us simply recognize this effect by letting F viscous denote the total viscous force exerted on the control surface. We are now ready to write anexpression for the left-hand side of Equation (2.56). The total force experiencedby the ﬂuid as it is sweeping through the ﬁxed control volume is given by the sumof Equations (2.57) and (2.58) and F viscous : F=......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay VρfdV−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SpdS+Fviscous (2.59) Now consider the right side of Equation (2.56). The time rate of change of momentum of the ﬂuid as it sweeps through the ﬁxed control volume is the sum of two terms: Net ﬂow of momentum out≡Gof control volume across surface S(2.60a)134 PART 1Fundamental Principles and Time rate of change of momentum due to≡Hunsteady ﬂuctuations of ﬂow properties inside V(2.60b) Consider the term denoted by Gin Equation (2.60 a). The ﬂow has a certain momentum as it enters the control volume in Figure 2.19, and, in general, it has a different momentum as it leaves the control volume (due in part to the force Fthat is exerted on the ﬂuid as it is sweeping through V). The netﬂow of momentum outof the control volume across the surface Sis simply this outﬂow minus the inﬂow of momentum across the control surface. This change in momentum isdenoted by G, as noted above. To obtain an expression for G, recall that the mass ﬂow across the elemental area dSis(ρV·dS); hence, the ﬂow of momentum per second across dSis (ρV·dS)V The net ﬂow of momentum out of the control volume through Sis the summation of the above elemental contributions, namely, G= ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)V (2.61) In Equation (2.61), recall that positive values of (ρV·dS)represent mass ﬂow out of the control volume, and negative values represent mass ﬂow into the controlvolume. Hence, in Equation (2.61) the integral over the whole control surface isa combination of positive contributions (outﬂow of momentum) and negativecontributions (inﬂow of momentum), with the resulting value of the integralrepresenting the net outﬂow of momentum. If Ghas a positive value, there is more momentum ﬂowing out of the control volume per second than ﬂowing in;conversely, if Ghas a negative value, there is more momentum ﬂowing into the control volume per second than ﬂowing out. Now consider Hfrom Equation (2.60b ). The momentum of the ﬂuid in the elemental volume dVshown in Figure 2.19 is (ρdV)V The momentum contained at any instant inside the control volume is therefore ......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay VρVdV and its time rate of change due to unsteady ﬂow ﬂuctuations is H=∂ ∂t......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay VρVdV (2.62) Combining Equations (2.61) and (2.62), we obtain an expression for the total time rate of change of momentum of the ﬂuid as it sweeps through the ﬁxedCHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 135 control volume, which in turn represents the right-hand side of Equation (2.56): d dt(mV)=G+H=................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)V+∂ ∂t......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay VρVdV (2.63) Hence, from Equations (2.59) and (2.63), Newton’s second law, d dt(mV)=F applied to a ﬂuid ﬂow is ∂ ∂t......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay VρVdV+................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)V=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SpdS+......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay VρfdV+Fviscous (2.64) Equation (2.64) is the momentum equation in integral form. Note that it is a vector equation. Just as in the case of the integral form of the continuity equation,Equation (2.64) has the advantage of relating aerodynamic phenomena over aﬁnite region of space without being concerned with the details of precisely whatis happening at a given distinct point in the ﬂow. This advantage is illustrated inSection 2.6. From Equation (2.64), we now proceed to a partial differential equation which relates ﬂow-ﬁeld properties at a point in space. Such an equation is a counterpartto the differential form of the continuity equation given in Equation (2.52). Ap-ply the gradient theorem, Equation (2.27), to the ﬁrst term on the right side ofEquation (2.64): − ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SpdS=−......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay V∇pdV (2.65) Also, because the control volume is ﬁxed, the time derivative in Equation (2.64) can be placed inside the integral. Hence, Equation (2.64) can be written as ......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay V∂(ρV) ∂tdV+................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)V=−......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay V∇pdV+......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay VρfdV+Fviscous (2.66) Recall that Equation (2.66) is a vector equation. It is convenient to write this equation as three scalar equations.

For the same reasons as stated in Section 2.4,the integrand in Equation (2.69) is identically zero at all points in the ﬂow;hence, ∂(ρu) ∂t+∇ ·(ρuV)=−∂p ∂x+ρfx+(Fx)viscous (2.70a) Equation (2.70 a) is the xcomponent of the momentum equation in differential form. Returning to Equation (2.66), and writing the yandzcomponents, we obtain in a similar fashion ∂(ρv) ∂t+∇ ·(ρvV)=−∂p ∂y+ρfy+(Fy)viscous (2.70b) and ∂(ρw) ∂t+∇ ·(ρwV)=−∂p ∂z+ρfz+(Fz)viscous (2.70c) where the subscripts yandzonfandFdenote the yandzcomponents of the body and viscous forces, respectively. Equations (2.70a toc) are the scalar x, y, and zcomponents of the momentum equation, respectively; they are par- tial differential equations that relate ﬂow-ﬁeld properties at any point in theﬂow. Note that Equations (2.64) and (2.70 atoc) apply to the unsteady, three- dimensional ﬂow of any ﬂuid, compressible or incompressible, viscous or invis-cid. Specialized to a steady (∂/∂ t≡0), inviscid (F viscous=0)ﬂow with no body forces (f=0), these equations become ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)V=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SpdS (2.71)CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 137 and ∇·(ρuV)=−∂p ∂x ∇·(ρvV)=−∂p ∂y ∇·(ρwV)=−∂p ∂z(2.72a) (2.72b) (2.72c) Since most of the material in Chapters 3 through 14 assumes steady, inviscid ﬂow with no body forces, we will have frequent occasion to use the momentumequation in the forms of Equations (2.71) and (2.72 atoc). The momentum equations for an inviscid ﬂow [such as Equations (2.72 atoc)] are called the Euler equations. The momentum equations for a viscous ﬂow [such as Equations (2.70 atoc)] are called the Navier-Stokes equations. We will encounter this terminology in subsequent chapters. 2.6 AN APPLICATION OF THE MOMENTUM EQUATION: DRAG OF A TWO-DIMENSIONAL BODY We brieﬂy interrupt our orderly development of the fundamental equations of ﬂuid dynamics in order to examine an important application of the integral formof the momentum equation. During the 1930s and 1940s, the National AdvisoryCommittee for Aeronautics (NACA) measured the lift and drag characteristics ofa series of systematically designed airfoil shapes (discussed in detail in Chapter 4).These measurements were carried out in a specially designed wind tunnel wherethe wing models spanned the entire test section (i.e., the wing tips were buttedagainst both sidewalls of the wind tunnel). This was done in order to establish two-dimensional (rather than three-dimensional) ﬂow over the wing, thus allowing theproperties of an airfoil (rather than a ﬁnite wing) to be measured. The distinctionbetween the aerodynamics of airfoils and that of ﬁnite wings is made in Chapters 4and 5. The important point here is that because the wings were mounted againstboth sidewalls of the wind tunnel, the NACA did not use a conventional forcebalance to measure the lift and drag. Rather, the lift was obtained from the pressuredistributions on the ceiling and ﬂoor of the tunnel (above and below the wing), and the drag was obtained from measurements of the ﬂow velocity downstream of the wing. These measurements may appear to be a strange way to measure theaerodynamic force on a wing. Indeed, how are these measurements related to liftand drag? What is going on here? The answers to these questions are addressed inthis section; they involve an application of the fundamental momentum equationin integral form, and they illustrate a basic technique that is frequently used inaerodynamics. Consider a two-dimensional body in a ﬂow, as sketched in Figure 2.20 a. A control volume is drawn around this body, as given by the dashed lines in138 PART 1Fundamental Principles (b)(a)Uniform velocityStreamline far away from body, p = p/H11009 p = p /H11009b hgc f 1 2y xu2 u1 de ia 2–D body Figure 2.20 (a) Control volume for obtaining drag on a two-dimensional body. (b) Rendering of the velocity proﬁles downstream of an airfoil. The proﬁles are made visible in water ﬂow by pulsing a voltage through a straight wire perpendicular to the ﬂow, thuscreating small bubbles of hydrogen that subsequently move downstream with the ﬂow.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 139 Figure 2.20 a. The control volume is bounded by: 1.The upper and lower streamlines far above and below the body ( abandhi, respectively). 2.Lines perpendicular to the ﬂow velocity far ahead of and behind the body (aiandbh, respectively). 3.A cut that surrounds and wraps the surface of the body (cdefg). The entire control volume is abcdefghia. The width of the control volume in the zdirection (perpendicular to the page) is unity. Stations 1 and 2 are inﬂow and outﬂow stations, respectively. Assume that the contour abhi is far enough from the body such that the pressure is everywhere the same on abhi and equal to the freestream pressure p=p∞. Also, assume that the inﬂow velocity u1is uniform across ai(as it would be in a freestream, or a test section of a wind tunnel). The outﬂow velocity u2is notuniform across bh, because the presence of the body has created a wake at the outﬂow station. However, assume that both u1andu2are in the xdirection; hence, u1=constant and u2=f(y). An actual photograph of the velocity proﬁles in a wake downstream of an airfoil is shown in Figure 2.20b . Consider the surface forces on the control volume shown in Figure 2.20a . They stem from twocontributions: 1.The pressure distribution over the surface abhi, −/integraldisplay/integraldisplay abhipdS 2.The surface force on defcreated by the presence of the body In the above list, the surface shear stress on abandhihas been neglected. Also, note that in Figure 2.20 athe cuts cdand fgare taken adjacent to each other; hence, any shear stress or pressure distribution on one is equal and opposite tothat on the other (i.e., the surface forces on cdand fgcancel each other). Also, note that the surface force on defis the equal and opposite reaction to the shear stress and pressure distribution created by the ﬂow over the surface of the body.To see this more clearly, examine Figure 2.21. On the left is shown the ﬂow overthe body. As explained in Section 1.5, the moving ﬂuid exerts pressure and shearstress distributions over the body surface which create a resultant aerodynamicforce per unit span R /primeon the body. In turn, by Newton’s third law, the body exerts equal and opposite pressure and shear stress distributions on the ﬂow (i.e., on thepart of the control surface bounded by def). Hence, the body exerts a force −R /prime on the control surface, as shown on the right of Figure 2.21. With the above inmind, the total surface force on the entire control volume is Surface force =−/integraldisplay/integraldisplay abhipdS−R/prime(2.73)140 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 2.21 Equal and opposite reactions on a body and adjacent section of control surface. Moreover, this is the total force on the control volume shown in Figure 2.20 a because the volumetric body force is negligible. Consider the integral form of the momentum equation as given by Equa- tion (2.64). The right-hand side of this equation is physically the force on the ﬂuid moving through the control volume. For the control volume in Figure 2.20 a, this force is simply the expression given by Equation (2.73). Hence, using Equa-tion (2.64), with the right-hand side given by Equation (2.73), we have ∂ ∂t......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay VρVdV+................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)V=−/integraldisplay/integraldisplay abhipdS−R/prime(2.74) Assuming steady ﬂow, Equation (2.74) becomes R/prime=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)V−/integraldisplay/integraldisplay abhipdS (2.75) Equation (2.75) is a vector equation. Consider again the control volume in Fig- ure 2.20 a. Take the xcomponent of Equation (2.75), noting that the inﬂow and outﬂow velocities u1andu2are in the xdirection and the xcomponent of R/primeis the aerodynamic drag per unit span D/prime: D/prime=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)u−/integraldisplay/integraldisplay abhi(pdS)x (2.76) In Equation (2.76), the last term is the component of the pressure force in the xdirection. [The expression (pdS)xis the xcomponent of the pressure force exerted on the elemental area dSof the control surface.] Recall that the boundaries of the control volume abhi are chosen far enough from the body such that pisCHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 141 constant along these boundaries. For a constant pressure. /integraldisplay/integraldisplay abhi(pdS)x=0 (2.77) because, looking along the xdirection in Figure 2.20 a, the pressure force on abhi pushing toward the right exactly balances the pressure force pushing toward the left. This is true no matter what the shape of abhi is, as long as pis constant along the surface (for proof of this statement, see Problem 2.1). Therefore, substitutingEquation (2.77) into (2.76), we obtain D /prime=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)u (2.78) Evaluating the surface integral in Equation (2.78), we note from Figure 2.20 a that: 1.The sections ab,hi, and defare streamlines of the ﬂow. Since by deﬁnition Vis parallel to the streamlines and dSis perpendicular to the control surface, along these sections VanddSare perpendicular vectors, and hence V·dS=0. As a result, the contributions of ab,hi, and defto the integral in Equation (2.78) are zero. 2.The cuts cdand fgare adjacent to each other. The mass ﬂux out of one is identically the mass ﬂux into the other. Hence, the contributions of cdand fgto the integral in Equation (2.78) cancel each other. As a result, the only contributions to the integral in Equation (2.78) come from sections aiandbh. These sections are oriented in the ydirection. Also, the control volume has unit depth in the zdirection (perpendicular to the page). Hence, for these sections, dS=dy(1). The integral in Equation (2.78) becomes ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)u=−/integraldisplaya iρiu2 1dy+/integraldisplayb hρ2u22dy (2.79) Note that the minus sign in front of the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Equation (2.79) is due to VanddSbeing in opposite directions along ai(station 1 is an inﬂow boundary); in contrast, VanddSare in the same direction over hb (station 2 is an outﬂow boundary), and hence the second term has a positive sign. Before going further with Equation (2.79), consider the integral form of the continuity equation for steady ﬂow, Equation (2.53). Applied to the controlvolume in Figure 2.20 a, Equation (2.53) becomes −/integraldisplaya iρ1u1dy+/integraldisplayb hρ2u2dy=0 or/integraldisplaya iρ1u1dy=/integraldisplayb hρ2u2dy (2.80)142 PART 1Fundamental Principles Multiplying Equation (2.80) by u1, which is a constant, we obtain /integraldisplaya iρ1u2 1dy=/integraldisplayb hρ2u2u1dy (2.81) Substituting Equation (2.81) into Equation (2.79), we have ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)u=−/integraldisplayb hρ2u2u1dy+/integraldisplayb hρ2u22dy or ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)u=−/integraldisplayb hρ2u2(u1−u2)dy (2.82) Substituting Equation (2.82) into Equation (2.78) yields D/prime=/integraldisplayb hρ2u2(u1−u2)dy (2.83) Equation (2.83) is the desired result of this section; it expresses the drag of a body in terms of the known freestream velocity u1and the ﬂow-ﬁeld properties ρ2andu2, across a vertical station downstream of the body. These downstream properties can be measured in a wind tunnel, and the drag per unit span of the body D/primecan be obtained by evaluating the integral in Equation (2.83) numerically, using the measured data for ρ2andu2as a function of y. Examine Equation (2.83) more closely. The quantity u1−u2is the velocity decrement at a given ylocation. That is, because of the drag on the body, there is a wake that trails downstream of the body. In this wake, there is a loss in ﬂow velocityu 1−u2. The quantity ρ2u2is simply the mass ﬂux; when multiplied by u1−u2, it gives the decrement in momentum. Therefore, the integral in Equation (2.83)is physically the decrement in momentum ﬂow that exists across the wake, andfrom Equation (2.83), this wake momentum decrement is equal to the drag on thebody. For incompressible ﬂow, ρ=constant and is known. For this case, Equa- tion (2.83) becomes D /prime=ρ/integraldisplayb hu2(u1−u2)dy (2.84) Equation (2.84) is the answer to the questions posed at the beginning of thissection. It shows how a measurement of the velocity distribution across the wakeof a body can yield the drag. These velocity distributions are conventionallymeasured with a Pitot rake, such as shown in Figure 2.22. This is nothing more thana series of Pitot tubes attached to a common stem, which allows the simultaneousmeasurement of velocity across the wake. (The principle of the Pitot tube as avelocity-measuring instrument is discussed in Chapter 3. See also pages 188–210of Reference 2 for an introductory discussion on Pitot tubes.) The result embodied in Equation (2.84) illustrates the power of the integral form of the momentum equation; it relates drag on a body located at some positionin the ﬂow to the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables at a completely different location.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 143 Figure 2.22 A Pitot rake for wake surveys (Courtesy of the John Anderson Collection and the University of Maryland Aerodynamic Laboratory). At the beginning of this section, it was mentioned that lift on a two- dimensional body can be obtained by measuring the pressures on the ceiling and ﬂoor of a wind tunnel, above and below the body. This relation can be estab-lished from the integral form of the momentum equation in a manner analogousto that used to establish the drag relation; the derivation is left as a homeworkproblem.

Both of these proﬁles are shown in Figure 2.24 and are compared withan exact velocity proﬁle obtained by means of a solution of the incompressible, laminarboundary-layer equations for a ﬂat plate. (This boundary-layer solution is discussed inChapter 18.) Note that the result n=2 gives a concave velocity proﬁle that is essentially nonphysical when compared to the convex proﬁles always observed in boundary layers.The result n=0.25 gives a convex velocity proﬁle that is qualitatively physically correct. However, this proﬁle is quantitatively inaccurate, as can be seen in comparison to the exactproﬁle. Hence, our original assumption of a power-law velocity proﬁle for the laminar146 PART 1Fundamental Principles boundary layer in the form of u/V∞=(y/δ)nis not very good, in spite of the fact that when n=2 or 0.25, this assumed velocity proﬁle does satisfy the momentum principle, applied over a large, ﬁnite control volume. 2.6.1 Comment In this section, we have applied the momentum principle (Newton’s second law) to large, ﬁxed control volumes in ﬂows. On one hand, we demonstrated that, byknowing the detailed ﬂow properties along the control surface, this applicationled to an accurate result for an overall quantity such as drag on a body, namely,Equation (2.83) for a compressible ﬂow and Equation (2.84) for an incompress-ible ﬂow. On the other hand, in Example 2.2, we have shown that, by knowingan overall quantity such as the net drag on a ﬂat plate, the ﬁnite control volumeconcept by itself does not necessarily provide an accurate calculation of detailedﬂow-ﬁeld properties along the control surface (in this case, the velocity proﬁle),although the momentum principle is certainly satisﬁed in the aggregate. Exam-ple 2.2 is designed speciﬁcally to demonstrate this fact. The weakness here isthe need to assume some form for the variation of ﬂow properties over the con- trol surface; in Example 2.2, the assumption of the particular power-law proﬁleproved to be unsatisfactory. 2.7 ENERGY EQUATION For an incompressible ﬂow, where ρis constant, the primary ﬂow-ﬁeld variables arepandV. The continuity and momentum equations obtained earlier are two equations in terms of the two unknowns pandV. Hence, for a study of incom- pressible ﬂow, the continuity and momentum equations are sufﬁcient tools to dothe job. However, for a compressible ﬂow, ρis an additional variable, and therefore we need an additional fundamental equation to complete the system. This funda-mental relation is the energy equation, to be derived in this section. In the process,two additional ﬂow-ﬁeld variables arise, namely, the internal energy eand tem- perature T. Additional equations must also be introduced for these variables, as will be mentioned later in this section. The material discussed in this section is germane to the study of compressible ﬂow. For those readers interested only in the study of incompressible ﬂow for thetime being, you may bypass this section and return to it at a later stage. Physical principle Energy can be neither created nor destroyed; it can only change in form. This physical principle is embodied in the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. A brief review of thermodynamics is given in Chapter 7. Thermodynamics is essential to the study of compressible ﬂow; however, at this stage, we will only introducethe ﬁrst law, and we defer any substantial discussion of thermodynamics untilChapter 7, where we begin to concentrate on compressible ﬂow.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 147 Consider a ﬁxed amount of matter contained within a closed boundary. This matter deﬁnes the system. Because the molecules and atoms within the system are constantly in motion, the system contains a certain amount of energy. For simplicity, let the system contain a unit mass; in turn, denote the internal energyper unit mass by e. The region outside the system deﬁnes the surroundings. Let an incremental amount of heat δqbe added to the system from the surroundings. Also, let δwbe the work done on the system by the surroundings. (The quantities δqandδware discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.) Both heat and work are forms of energy,and when added to the system, they change the amount of internal energy in thesystem. Denote this change of internal energy by de. From our physical principle that energy is conserved, we have for the system δq+δw=de (2.85) Equation (2.85) is a statement of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. Let us apply the ﬁrst law to the ﬂuid ﬂowing through the ﬁxed control volume shown in Figure 2.19. Let B 1=rate of heat added to ﬂuid inside control volume from surroundings B2=rate of work done on ﬂuid inside control volume B3=rate of change of energy of ﬂuid as it ﬂows through control volume From the ﬁrst law, B1+B2=B3 (2.86) Note that each term in Equation (2.86) involves the time rate of energy change; hence, Equation (2.86) is, strictly speaking, a power equation. However, because it is a statement of the fundamental principle of conservation of energy, the equationis conventionally termed the “energy equation.” We continue this convention here. First, consider the rate of heat transferred to or from the ﬂuid. This can be visualized as volumetric heating of the ﬂuid inside the control volume due toabsorption of radiation originating outside the system or the local emission ofradiation by the ﬂuid itself, if the temperature inside the control volume is highenough. In addition, there may be chemical combustion processes taking placeinside the control volume, such as fuel-air combustion in a jet engine. Let thisvolumetric rate of heat addition per unit mass be denoted by ˙q. Typical units for ˙q are J/s ·kg or ft ·lb/s·slug. Examining Figure 2.19, the mass contained within an elemental volume is ρdV; hence, the rate of heat addition to this mass is ˙q(ρdV). Summing over the complete control volume, we obtain Rate of volumetric heating = ......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay V˙qρdV (2.87) In addition, if the ﬂow is viscous, heat can be transferred into the control volume by means of thermal conduction and mass diffusion across the control surface.148 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 2.25 Schematic for the rate of doing work by a force Fexerted on a moving body. At this stage, a detailed development of these viscous heat-addition terms is not warranted; they are considered in detail in Chapter 15. Rather, let us denotethe rate of heat addition to the control volume due to viscous effects simply by ˙Q viscous . Therefore, in Equation (2.86), the total rate of heat addition is given by Equation (2.87) plus ˙Qviscous : B1=......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay V˙qρdV+˙Qviscous (2.88) Before considering the rate of work done on the ﬂuid inside the control volume, consider a simpler case of a solid object in motion, with a force Fbeing exerted on the object, as sketched in Figure 2.25. The position of the object is measuredfrom a ﬁxed origin by the radius vector r. In moving from position r 1tor2over an interval of time dt, the object is displaced through dr. By deﬁnition, the work done on the object in time dtisF·dr. Hence, the time rate of doing work is simply F·dr/dt . However, dr/dt =V, the velocity of the moving object. Hence, we can state that Rate of doing work on moving body =F·V In words, the rate of work done on a moving body is equal to the product of itsvelocity and the component of force in the direction of the velocity. This result leads to an expression for B 2, as follows. Consider the elemental areadSof the control surface in Figure 2.19. The pressure force on this elemental area is −pdS. From the above result, the rate of work done on the ﬂuid passing through dSwith velocity Vis(−pdS) ·V. Hence, summing over the complete control surface, we have Rate of work done on ﬂuid inside Vdue to pressure force on S=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(pdS) ·V (2.89) In addition, consider an elemental volume dVinside the control volume, as shown in Figure 2.19. Recalling that fis the body force per unit mass, the rate of work done on the elemental volume due to the body force is (ρfdV)·V. SummingCHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 149 over the complete control volume, we obtain Rate of work done on ﬂuid inside Vdue to body forces=......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay V(ρfdV)·V (2.90) If the ﬂow is viscous, the shear stress on the control surface will also perform work on the ﬂuid as it passes across the surface. Once again, a detailed development ofthis term is deferred until Chapter 15. Let us denote this contribution simply by ˙W viscous . Then the total rate of work done on the ﬂuid inside the control volume is the sum of Equations (2.89) and (2.90) and ˙Wviscous : B2=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SpV·dS+......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Vρ(f·V)dV+˙Wviscous (2.91) To visualize the energy inside the control volume, recall that in the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics as stated in Equation (2.85), the internal energy eis due to the random motion of the atoms and molecules inside the system. Equation (2.85) is written for a stationary system. However, the ﬂuid inside the control volume inFigure 2.19 is not stationary; it is moving at the local velocity Vwith a consequent kinetic energy per unit mass of V 2/2. Hence, the energy per unit mass of the moving ﬂuid is the sum of both internal and kinetic energies e+V2/2. This sum is called the total energy per unit mass. We are now ready to obtain an expression for B3, the rate of change of total energy of the ﬂuid as it ﬂows through the control volume. Keep in mind that massﬂows into the control volume of Figure 2.19 bringing with it a certain total energy;at the same time mass ﬂows out of the control volume taking with it a generallydifferent amount of total energy. The elemental mass ﬂow across dSisρV·dS, and therefore the elemental ﬂow of total energy across dSis(ρV·dS)(e+V 2/2). Summing over the complete control surface, we obtain Net rate of ﬂow of total energy across control surface=................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg (2.92) In addition, if the ﬂow is unsteady, there is a time rate of change of total energyinside the control volume due to the transient ﬂuctuations of the ﬂow-ﬁeld vari-ables. The total energy contained in the elemental volume dVisρ(e+V 2/2)dV, and hence the total energy inside the complete control volume at any instant intime is ......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Vρ/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg dV Therefore, Time rate of change of total energy inside Vdue to transient variations of ﬂow-ﬁeld variables=∂ ∂t......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Vρ/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg dV (2.93)150 PART 1Fundamental Principles In turn, B3is the sum of Equations (2.92) and (2.93): B3=∂ ∂t......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Vρ/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg dV+................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg (2.94) Repeating the physical principle stated at the beginning of this section, the rate of heat added to the ﬂuid plus the rate of work done on the ﬂuid is equal to the rate of change of total energy of the ﬂuid as it ﬂows through the control volume(i.e., energy is conserved ). In turn, these words can be directly translated into an equation by combining Equations (2.86), (2.88), (2.91), and (2.94): ......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay V˙qρdV+˙Qviscous−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SpV·dS+......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Vρ(f·V)dV+˙Wviscous =∂ ∂t......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Vρ/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg dV+................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Sρ/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg V·dS(2.95) Equation (2.95) is the energy equation in integral form; it is essentially the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics applied to a ﬂuid ﬂow. For the sake of completeness, note that if a shaft penetrates the control surface in Figure 2.19, driving some power machinery located inside the control volume(say, a compressor of a jet engine), then the rate of work delivered by the shaft, ˙W shaft, must be added to the left side of Equation (2.95). Also note that the potential energy does not appear explicitly in Equation (2.95). Changes in potential energyare contained in the body force term when the force of gravity is included in f. For the aerodynamic problems considered in this book, shaft work is not treated,and changes in potential energy are always negligible. Following the approach established in Sections 2.4 and 2.5, we can obtain a partial differential equation for total energy from the integral form given inEquation (2.95). Applying the divergence theorem to the surface integrals inEquation (2.95), collecting all terms inside the same volume integral, and settingthe integrand equal to zero, we obtain ∂ ∂t/bracketleftbigg ρ/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg +∇ ·/bracketleftbigg ρ/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg V/bracketrightbigg =ρ˙q−∇ ·(pV)+ρ(f·V) +˙Q/prime viscous+˙W/prime viscous (2.96) where ˙Q/primeviscous and˙W/prime viscous represent the proper forms of the viscous terms, to be obtained in Chapter 15. Equation (2.96) is a partial differential equation which relates the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables at a given point in space. If the ﬂow is steady (∂/∂ t=0), inviscid (˙Qviscous=0 and ˙Wviscous=0), adiabatic (no heat addition, ˙q=0), without body forces (f=0), then Equa- tions (2.95) and (2.96) reduce to ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Sρ/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg V·dS=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SpV·dS (2.97)CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 151 and ∇·/bracketleftbigg ρ/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg V/bracketrightbigg = −∇ ·(pV) (2.98) Equations (2.97) and (2.98) are discussed and applied at length beginning with Chapter 7. With the energy equation, we have introduced another unknown ﬂow-ﬁeld variable e. We now have three equations, continuity, momentum, and energy, which involve four dependent variables, ρ,p,V, and e. A fourth equation can be obtained from a thermodynamic state relation for e(see Chapter 7). If the gas is calorically perfect, then e=cvT (2.99) where cvis the speciﬁc heat at constant volume. Equation (2.99) introduces tem- perature as yet another dependent variable. However, the system can be completedby using the perfect gas equation of state p=ρRT (2.100) where Ris the speciﬁc gas constant. Therefore, the continuity, momentum, and energy equations, along with Equations (2.99) and (2.100) are ﬁve independentequations for the ﬁve unknowns, ρ,p,V,e, and T. The matter of a perfect gas and related equations of state are reviewed in detail in Chapter 7; Equations (2.99) and(2.100) are presented here only to round out our development of the fundamentalequations of ﬂuid ﬂow. 2.8 INTERIM SUMMARY At this stage, let us pause and think about the various equations we have developed.Do not fall into the trap of seeing these equations as just a jumble of mathematicalsymbols that, by now, might look all the same to you. Quite the contrary, theseequations speak words: for example, Equations (2.48), (2.52), (2.53), and (2.54)all say that mass is conserved; Equations (2.64), (2.70 atoc), (2.71), and (2.72 ato c) are statements of Newton’s second law applied to a ﬂuid ﬂow; Equations (2.95) to (2.98) say that energy is conserved. It is very important to be able to see thephysical principles behind these equations. When you look at an equation, try todevelop the ability to see past a collection of mathematical symbols and, instead,to read the physics that the equation represents. The equations listed above are fundamental to all of aerodynamics. Take the time to go back over them. Become familiar with the way they are developed,and make yourself comfortable with their ﬁnal forms. In this way, you will ﬁndour subsequent aerodynamic applications that much easier to understand. Also, note our location on the road map shown in Figure 2.3. We have ﬁnished the items on the left branch of the map—we have obtained the basic ﬂow equationscontaining the fundamental physics of ﬂuid ﬂow. We now start with the branch152 PART 1Fundamental Principles on the right, which is a collection of useful concepts helpful in the application of the basic ﬂow equations. 2.9 SUBSTANTIAL DERIVATIVE Consider a small ﬂuid element moving through a ﬂow ﬁeld, as shown in Fig-ure 2.26. This ﬁgure is basically an extension of Figure 2.16, in which we intro-duced the concept of a ﬂuid element moving through a speciﬁed ﬂow ﬁeld. Thevelocity ﬁeld is given by V=ui+vj+wk, where u=u(x,y,z,t) v=v(x,y,z,t) w=w(x,y,z,t) In addition, the density ﬁeld is given by ρ=ρ(x,y,z,t) At time t 1, the ﬂuid element is located at point 1 in the ﬂow (see Figure 2.26), and its density is ρ1=ρ(x1,y1,z1,t1) At a later time t2the same ﬂuid element has moved to a different location in the ﬂow ﬁeld, such as point 2 in Figure 2.26. At this new time and location, thedensity of the ﬂuid element is ρ 2=ρ(x2,y2,z2,t2) Figure 2.26 Fluid element moving in a ﬂow ﬁeld—illustration for the substantial derivative.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 153 Since ρ=ρ(x,y,z,t), we can expand this function in a Taylor series about point 1 as follows: ρ2=ρ1+/parenleftbigg∂ρ ∂x/parenrightbigg 1(x2−x1)+/parenleftbigg∂ρ ∂y/parenrightbigg 1(y2−y1)+/parenleftbigg∂ρ ∂z/parenrightbigg 1(z2−z1) +/parenleftbigg∂ρ ∂t/parenrightbigg 1(t2−t1)+higher-order terms Dividing by t2−t1, and ignoring the higher-order terms, we have ρ2−ρ1 t2−t1=/parenleftbigg∂ρ ∂x/parenrightbigg 1x2−x1 t2−t1+/parenleftbigg∂ρ ∂y/parenrightbigg 1/parenleftbiggy2−y1 t2−t1/parenrightbigg +/parenleftbigg∂ρ ∂z/parenrightbigg 1z2−z1 t2−t1+/parenleftbigg∂ρ ∂t/parenrightbigg 1 (2.101) Consider the physical meaning of the left side of Equation (2.101). The term (ρ2−ρ1)/(t 2−t1)is the average time rate of change in density of the ﬂuid element as it moves from point 1 to point 2. In the limit, as t2approaches t1, this term becomes lim t2→t 1ρ2−ρ1 t2−t1=Dρ Dt Here, Dρ/Dtis a symbol for the instantaneous time rate of change of density of the ﬂuid element as it moves through point 1. By deﬁnition, this symbol is calledthesubstantial derivative D /Dt. Note that Dρ/Dtis the time rate of change of density of a given ﬂuid element as it moves through space. Here, our eyes are locked on the ﬂuid element as it is moving, and we are watching the density of theelement change as it moves through point 1. This is different from (∂ρ/∂ t) 1, which is physically the time rate of change of density at the ﬁxed point 1. For (∂ρ/∂ t)1, we ﬁx our eyes on the stationary point 1, and watch the density change due totransient ﬂuctuations in the ﬂow ﬁeld. Thus, Dρ/Dtand∂ρ/∂ tare physically and numerically different quantities. Returning to Equation (2.101), note that lim t2→t 1x2−x1 t2−t1≡u lim t2→t 1y2−y1 t2−t1≡v lim t2→t 1z2−z1 t2−t1≡w Thus, taking the limit of Equation (2.101) as t2→t1, we obtain Dρ Dt=u∂ρ ∂x+v∂ρ ∂y+w∂ρ ∂z+∂ρ ∂t(2.102)154 PART 1Fundamental Principles Examine Equation (2.102) closely. From it, we can obtain an expression for the substantial derivative in cartesian coordinates: D Dt≡∂ ∂t+u∂ ∂x+v∂ ∂y+w∂ ∂z(2.103) Furthermore, in cartesian coordinates, the vector operator ∇is deﬁned as ∇≡ i∂ ∂x+j∂ ∂y+k∂ ∂z Hence, Equation (2.103) can be written as D Dt≡∂ ∂t+(V·∇) (2.104) Equation (2.104) represents a deﬁnition of the substantial derivative in vectornotation; thus, it is valid for any coordinate system. Focusing on Equation (2.104), we once again emphasize that D/Dtis the substantial derivative, which is physically the time rate of change following amoving ﬂuid element; ∂/∂tis called the local derivative, which is physically the time rate of change at a ﬁxed point; V·∇is called the convective derivative, which is physically the time rate of change due to the movement of the ﬂuidelement from one location to another in the ﬂow ﬁeld where the ﬂow propertiesare spatially different. The substantial derivative applies to any ﬂow-ﬁeld variable(e.g., Dp/Dt,DT/Dt,Du/Dt). For example, DT Dt≡∂T ∂t+(V·∇)T≡∂T ∂t+u∂T ∂x+v∂T ∂y+w∂T ∂z(2.105) local derivativeconvective derivative Again, Equation (2.105) states physically that the temperature of the ﬂuid elementis changing as the element sweeps past a point in the ﬂow because at that point theﬂow-ﬁeld temperature itself may be ﬂuctuating with time (the local derivative)and because the ﬂuid element is simply on its way to another point in the ﬂowﬁeld where the temperature is different (the convective derivative). Consider an example that will help to reinforce the physical meaning of the substantial derivative. Imagine that you are hiking in the mountains, and you areabout to enter a cave. The temperature inside the cave is cooler than outside. Thus,as you walk through the mouth of the cave, you feel a temperature decrease—thisis analogous to the convective derivative in Equation (2.105). However, imaginethat, at the same time, a friend throws a snowball at you such that the snowball hitsyou just at the same instant you pass through the mouth of the cave. You will feelan additional, but momentary, temperature drop when the snowball hits you—thisis analogous to the local derivative in Equation (2.105). The net temperature dropyou feel as you walk through the mouth of the cave is therefore a combinationof both the act of moving into the cave, where it is cooler, and being struck bythe snowball at the same instant—this net temperature drop is analogous to thesubstantial derivative in Equation (2.105).CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 155 EXAMPLE 2.3 Return to the subsonic compressible ﬂow over a wavy wall treated in Example 2.1. In that example we calculated the time rate of change of the volume of a ﬂuid element per unitvolume at the point ( x//lscript,y//lscript)=( 1 4,1) to be −0.7327 s−1. That is, at the instant the ﬂuid element was passing through this point, its volume was experiencing a rate of decrease of 73 percent per second, a substantial instantaneous rate of change. Moreover, we noted inExample 2.1 that, because the volume was decreasing and hence the density increasing,the point ( 1 4,1) must be in a compression region. This would imply that the ﬂuid element is slowing down as it passes through point (1 4,1); i.e., it is experiencing a deceleration. Calculate the value of the deceleration at this point. ■Solution Acceleration (or deceleration) is physically the time rate of change of velocity. The timerate of change of velocity of a moving ﬂuid element is, from the physical meaning of thesubstantial derivative, the substantial derivative of the velocity. Let us deal in terms ofcartesian coordinates.

The acceleration of gravity at sea level on earth is 9.8 m/s2. Observe that the ﬂuid element in this example is locally experiencing a deceleration with an absolute magnitude that is 36.6 times that of the acceleration of gravity; i.e., the ﬂuid element as it passesthrough point ( 1 4, 1) is experiencing a large deceleration of 36.6 g. This is totally consistent with the result from Example 2.1 that the ﬂuid element is simultaneously experiencing avery rapid change in volume of 73 percent per second. (To relate to human experience, ahuman being can tolerate only up to 10 gacceleration or deceleration, and that for only a few seconds before life-threatening bodily injury.) The ﬂow ﬁeld shown in Figure 2.17and treated here and in Example 2.1 is relatively benign; indeed, it is a ﬂow involving onlysmall perturbations from a uniform ﬂow. Subsonic small perturbation ﬂows are treated inChapter 11. Yet, from this example we deduce that a given ﬂuid element, even though it ismoving through a rather calm ﬂow ﬁeld, gets rather drastically pushed around. The forcethat is pushing around the ﬂuid element is supplied by the pressure gradients in the ﬂow,as discussed in Section 2.5. 2.10 FUNDAMENTAL EQUATIONS IN TERMS OF THE SUBSTANTIAL DERIVATIVE In this section, we express the continuity, momentum, and energy equations in terms of the substantial derivative. In the process, we make use of the followingvector identity: ∇·(ρV)≡ρ∇·V+V·∇ρ (2.106) In words, this identity states that the divergence of a scalar times a vector is equalto the scalar times the divergence of the vector plus the dot product of the vectorand the gradient of the scalar. First, consider the continuity equation given in the form of Equation (2.52): ∂ρ ∂t+∇ ·(ρV)=0 (2.52) Using the vector identity given by Equation (2.106), Equation (2.52) becomes ∂ρ ∂t+V·∇ρ+ρ∇·V=0 (2.107)CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 159 However, the sum of the ﬁrst two terms of Equation (2.107) is the substantial derivative of ρ[see Equation (2.104)]. Thus, from Equation (2.107), Dρ Dt+ρ∇·V=0 (2.108) Equation (2.108) is the form of the continuity equation written in terms of thesubstantial derivative. Next, consider the xcomponent of the momentum equation given in the form of Equation (2.70 a): ∂(ρu) ∂t+∇ ·(ρuV)=−∂p ∂x+ρfx+(Fx)viscous (2.70a) The ﬁrst terms can be expanded as ∂(ρu) ∂t=ρ∂u ∂t+u∂ρ ∂t(2.109) In the second term of Equation (2.70a ), treat the scalar quantity as uand the vector quantity as ρV. Then the term can be expanded using the vector identity in Equation (2.106): ∇·(ρuV)≡∇ ·[u(ρV)]=u∇·(ρV)+(ρV)·∇u (2.110) Substituting Equations (2.109) and (2.110) into (2.70 a), we obtain ρ∂u ∂t+u∂ρ ∂t+u∇·(ρV)+(ρV)·∇u=−∂p ∂x+ρfx+(Fx)viscous or ρ∂u ∂t+u/bracketleftbigg∂ρ ∂t+∇ ·(ρV)/bracketrightbigg +(ρV)·∇u=−∂p ∂x+ρfx+(Fx)viscous (2.111) Examine the two terms inside the square brackets; they are precisely the left side ofthe continuity equation, Equation (2.52). Since the right side of Equation (2.52) iszero, the sum inside the square brackets is zero. Hence, Equation (2.111) becomes ρ∂u ∂t+ρV·∇u=−∂p ∂x+ρfx+(Fx)viscous or ρ/parenleftbigg∂u ∂t+V·∇u/parenrightbigg =−∂p ∂x+ρfx+(Fx)viscous (2.112) Examine the two terms inside the parentheses in Equation (2.112); their sum isprecisely the substantial derivative Du/Dt. Hence, Equation (2.112) becomes ρDu Dt=−∂p ∂x+ρfx+(Fx)viscous (2.113a)160 PART 1Fundamental Principles In a similar manner, Equations (2.70b andc) yield (2.113b) ρDv Dt=−∂p ∂y+ρfy+(Fy)viscous ρDw Dt=−∂p ∂z+ρfz+(Fz)viscous(2.113c) Equations (2.113 atoc) are the x,y, and zcomponents of the momentum equa- tionwritten in terms of the substantial derivative. Compare these equations with Equations (2.70 atoc). Note that the right sides of both sets of equations are unchanged; only the left sides are different. In an analogous fashion, the energy equation given in the form of Equa- tion (2.96) can be expressed in terms of the substantial derivative. The derivation is left as a homework problem; the result is ρD(e+V2/2) Dt=ρ˙q−∇ ·(pV)+ρ(f·V)+˙Q/prime viscous+˙W/prime viscous (2.114) Again, the right-hand sides of Equations (2.96) and (2.114) are the same; only the form of the left sides is different. In modern aerodynamics, it is conventional to call the form of Equa- tions (2.52), (2.70 atoc), and (2.96) the conservation form of the fundamental equations (sometimes these equations are labeled as the divergence form because of the divergence terms on the left side). In contrast, the form of Equations (2.108),(2.113 atoc), and (2.114), which deals with the substantial derivative on the left side, is called the nonconservation form. Both forms are equally valid statements of the fundamental principles, and in most cases, there is no particular reason tochoose one form over the other. The nonconservation form is frequently foundin textbooks and in aerodynamic theory. However, for the numerical solution ofsome aerodynamic problems, the conservation form sometimes leads to moreaccurate results. Hence, the distinction between the conservation form and thenonconservation form has become important in the modern discipline of compu-tational ﬂuid dynamics. (See Reference 7 for more details.) 2.11 PATHLINES, STREAMLINES, AND STREAKLINES OF A FLOW In addition to knowing the density, pressure, temperature, and velocity ﬁelds, inaerodynamics we like to draw pictures of “where the ﬂow is going.” To accom-plish this, we construct diagrams of pathlines and/or streamlines of the ﬂow. Thedistinction between pathlines and streamlines is described in this section. Consider an unsteady ﬂow with a velocity ﬁeld given by V=V(x,y,z,t). Also, consider an inﬁnitesimal ﬂuid element moving through the ﬂow ﬁeld, say,element Aas shown in Figure 2.27 a. Element Apasses through point 1. Let usCHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 161 Figure 2.27 Pathlines for two different ﬂuid elements passing through the same point in space: unsteady ﬂow. trace the path of element Aas it moves downstream from point 1, as given by the dashed line in Figure 2.27 a. Such a path is deﬁned as the pathline for element A. Now, trace the path of another ﬂuid element, say, element Bas shown in Figure 2.27b . Assume that element Balso passes through point 1, but at some different time from element A. The pathline of element Bis given by the dashed line in Figure 2.27b . Because the ﬂow is unsteady, the velocity at point 1 (and at all other points of the ﬂow) changes with time. Hence, the pathlines of elements AandBare different curves in Figure 2.27 aandb. In general, for unsteady ﬂow, the pathlines for different ﬂuid elements passing through the same point are not the same. In Section 1.4, the concept of a streamline was introduced in a somewhat heuristic manner. Let us be more precise here. By deﬁnition, a streamline is a curve whose tangent at any point is in the direction of the velocity vector at thatpoint. Streamlines are illustrated in Figure 2.28. The streamlines are drawn suchthat their tangents at every point along the streamline are in the same direction asthe velocity vectors at those points. If the ﬂow is unsteady, the streamline patternis different at different times because the velocity vectors are ﬂuctuating withtime in both magnitude and direction. In general, streamlines are different from pathlines. You can visualize a path- line as a time-exposure photograph of a given ﬂuid element, whereas a streamlinepattern is like a single frame of a motion picture of the ﬂow. In an unsteadyﬂow, the streamline pattern changes; hence, each “frame” of the motion pictureis different. However, for the case of steady ﬂow (which applies to most of the applications in this book), the magnitude and direction of the velocity vectors at all points areﬁxed, invariant with time. Hence, the pathlines for different ﬂuid elements goingthrough the same point are the same. Moreover, the pathlines and streamlinesare identical. Therefore, in steady ﬂow, there is no distinction between pathlines162 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 2.28 Streamlines. Figure 2.29 For steady ﬂow, streamlines and pathlines are the same. and streamlines; they are the same curves in space. This fact is reinforced in Fig- ure 2.29, which illustrates the ﬁxed, time-invariant streamline (pathline) throughpoint 1. In Figure 2.29, a given ﬂuid element passing through point 1 traces apathline downstream. All subsequent ﬂuid elements passing through point 1 atlater times trace the same pathline. Since the velocity vector is tangent to the path-line at all points on the pathline for all times, the pathline is also a streamline. Forthe remainder of this book, we deal mainly with the concept of streamlines ratherthan pathlines; however, always keep in mind the distinction described above. Question: Given the velocity ﬁeld of a ﬂow, how can we obtain the mathemat- ical equation for a streamline? Obviously, the streamline illustrated in Figure 2.29is a curve in space, and hence it can be described by the equation f(x,y,z)=0. How can we obtain this equation? To answer this question, let dsbe a directed element of the streamline, such as shown at point 2 in Figure 2.29. The velocityat point 2 is V, and by deﬁnition of a streamline, Vis parallel to ds. Hence, from the deﬁnition of the vector cross product [see Equation (2.4)], ds×V=0 (2.115) Equation (2.115) is a valid equation for a streamline. To put it in a more recog-nizable form, expand Equation (2.115) in cartesian coordinates: ds=dxi+dyj+dzk V=ui+vj+wkCHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 163 ds×V=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglei jk dx dy dz uvw/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle =i(wdy−vdz)+j(u dz −wdx)+k(vdx−udy)=0 (2.116) Since the vector given by Equation (2.116) is zero, its components must each be zero: (2.117a) wdy−vdz=0 u dz−wdx=0 vdx−udy=0(2.117b) (2.117c) Equations (2.117 atoc) are differential equations for the streamline. Knowing u, v, andwas functions of x,y, and z, Equations (2.117 atoc) can be integrated to yield the equation for the streamline: f(x,y,z)=0. To reinforce the physical meaning of Equations (2.117 atoc), consider a streamline in two dimensions, as sketched in Figure 2.30 a. The equation of this streamline is y=f(x). Hence, at point 1 on the streamline, the slope is dy/dx. However, Vwith xandycomponents uandv, respectively, is tangent to the streamline at point 1. Thus, the slope of the streamline is also given by v/u, as shown in Figure 2.30. Therefore, dy dx=v u(2.118) Figure 2.30 (a) Equation of a stream in two-dimensional cartesian space. (b) Sketch of a streamtube in three-dimensional space.164 PART 1Fundamental Principles Equation (2.118) is a differential equation for a streamline in two dimensions. From Equation (2.118), vdx−udy=0 which is precisely Equation (2.117c ). Therefore, Equations (2.117 atoc) and (2.118) simply state mathematically that the velocity vector is tangent to thestreamline. A concept related to streamlines is that of a streamtube. Consider an arbitrary closed curve Cin three-dimensional space, as shown in Figure 2.30b . Consider the streamlines which pass through all points on C. These streamlines form a tube in space as sketched in Figure 2.30b ; such a tube is called a streamtube. For example, the walls of an ordinary garden hose form a streamtube for the waterﬂowing through the hose. For a steady ﬂow, a direct application of the integralform of the continuity equation [Equation (2.53)] proves that the mass ﬂow acrossall cross sections of a streamtube is constant. (Prove this yourself.) EXAMPLE 2.4 Consider the velocity ﬁeld given by u=y/(x2+y2)andv=− x/(x2+y2). Calculate the equation of the streamline passing through the point (0,5). ■Solution From Equation (2.118), dy/dx=v/u=−x/y, and ydy=−x dx Integrating, we obtain y2=−x2+c where cis a constant of integration. For the streamline through (0,5), we have 52=0+corc=25 Thus, the equation of the streamline is x2+y2=25 Note that the streamline is a circle with its center at the origin and a radius of 5 units. Streamlines are by far the most common method used to visualize a ﬂuid ﬂow. In an unsteady ﬂow it is also useful to track the path of a given ﬂuid element as it moves through the ﬂow ﬁeld (i.e., to trace out the pathline of the ﬂuid element). However, separate from the ideas of a streamline and a pathline is the concept of a streakline. Consider a ﬁxed point in a ﬂow ﬁeld, such as point 1 in Figure 2.31. Consider all the individual ﬂuid elementsthat have passed through point 1 over a given time interval t 2−t1. These ﬂuid elements, shown in Figure 2.31, are connected with each other, like a string of elephants con-nected trunk-to-tail. Element Ais the ﬂuid element that passed through point 1 at time t 1.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 165 y x z1 Time = t2ABC Figure 2.31 Illustration of a streakline through point 1. Element Bis the next element that passed through point 1, just behind element A. Ele- ment Cis the element that passed through point 1 just behind element B, and so forth. Figure 2.31 is an illustration, made at time t2, which shows all the ﬂuid elements that have earlier passed through point 1 over the time interval (t2−t1). The line that connects all these ﬂuid elements is, by deﬁnition, a streakline. We can more concisely deﬁne a streakline as the locus of ﬂuid elements that have earlier passed through a prescribed point. To help further visualize the concept of a streakline, imagine that we are constantlyinjecting dye into the ﬂow ﬁeld at point 1. The dye will ﬂow downstream from point 1,forming a curve in the x,y,zspace in Figure 2.31. This curve isthe streakline shown in Figure 2.31. A photograph of a streakline in the ﬂow of water over a circular cylinderis shown in Figure 3.48. The white streakline is made visible by white particles that areconstantly formed by electrolysis near a small anode ﬁxed on the cylinder surface. Thesewhite particles subsequently ﬂow downstream forming a streakline. For a steady ﬂow, pathlines, streamlines, and streaklines are all the same curves. Only in an unsteady ﬂow are they different. So for steady ﬂow, which is the type of ﬂowmainly considered in this book, the concepts of a pathline, streamline, and streakline areredundant. 2.12 ANGULAR VELOCITY, VORTICITY, AND STRAIN In several of our previous discussions, we made use of the concept of a ﬂuid ele- ment moving through the ﬂow ﬁeld. In this section, we examine this motion moreclosely, paying particular attention to the orientation of the element and its changein shape as it moves along a streamline. In the process, we introduce the conceptof vorticity, one of the most powerful quantities in theoretical aerodynamics.166 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 2.32 The motion of a ﬂuid element along a streamline is a combination of translation and rotation; in addition, the shape of the element can become distorted. Consider an inﬁnitesimal ﬂuid element moving in a ﬂow ﬁeld. As it translates along a streamline, it may also rotate, and in addition its shape may become dis- torted as sketched in Figure 2.32. The amount of rotation and distortion depends on the velocity ﬁeld; the purpose of this section is to quantify this dependency. Consider a two-dimensional ﬂow in the xyplane. Also, consider an inﬁnitesi- mal ﬂuid element in this ﬂow. Assume that at time tthe shape of this ﬂuid element is rectangular, as shown at the left of Figure 2.33. Assume that the ﬂuid element is moving upward and to the right; its position and shape at time t+/Delta1tare shown at the right in Figure 2.33. Note that during the time increment /Delta1t, the sides ABandAChave rotated through the angular displacements −/Delta1θ 1and/Delta1θ2, respectively. (Counterclockwise rotations by convention are considered positive; Figure 2.33 Rotation and distortion of a ﬂuid element.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 167 since line ABis shown with a clockwise rotation in Figure 2.33, the angular dis- placement is negative, −/Delta1θ 1.) At present, consider just the line AC. It has rotated because during the time increment /Delta1t, point Chas moved differently from point A. Consider the velocity in the ydirection. At point Aat time t, this velocity is v, as shown in Figure 2.33. Point Cis a distance dxfrom point A; hence, at time t the vertical component of velocity of point Cis given by v+(∂v/∂ x)dx. Hence, Distance in ydirection that Amoves during time increment /Delta1t=v/Delta1t Distance in ydirection that Cmoves during time increment /Delta1t=/parenleftbigg v+∂v ∂xdx/parenrightbigg /Delta1t Net displacement in ydirection ofCrelative to A=/parenleftbigg v+∂v ∂xdx/parenrightbigg /Delta1t−v/Delta1t =/parenleftbigg∂v ∂xdx/parenrightbigg /Delta1t This net displacement is shown at the right of Figure 2.33. From the geometry of Figure 2.33, tan/Delta1θ2=[(∂v/∂ x)dx]/Delta1t dx=∂v ∂x/Delta1t (2.119) Since/Delta1θ2is a small angle, tan /Delta1θ2≈/Delta1θ2. Hence, Equation (2.119) reduces to /Delta1θ2=∂v ∂x/Delta1t (2.120) Now consider line AB. The xcomponent of the velocity at point Aat time t isu, as shown in Figure 2.33. Because point Bis a distance dyfrom point A, the horizontal component of velocity of point Bat time tisu+(∂u/∂y)dy. By reasoning similar to that above, the net displacement in the xdirection of Brelative to Aover the time increment /Delta1tis [(∂ u/∂y)dy]/Delta1t, as shown in Figure 2.33. Hence, tan(−/Delta1θ 1)=[(∂u/∂y)dy]/Delta1t dy=∂u ∂y/Delta1t (2.121) Since−/Delta1θ 1is small, Equation (2.121) reduces to /Delta1θ1=−∂u ∂y/Delta1t (2.122) Consider the angular velocities of lines ABandAC, deﬁned as dθ1/dtanddθ2/dt, respectively. From Equation (2.122), we have dθ1 dt=lim /Delta1t→0/Delta1θ1 /Delta1t=−∂u ∂y(2.123)168 PART 1Fundamental Principles From Equation (2.120), we have dθ2 dt=lim /Delta1t→0/Delta1θ2 /Delta1t=∂v ∂x(2.124) By deﬁnition, the angular velocity of the ﬂuid element as seen in the xyplane is the average of the angular velocities of lines ABandAC. Letωzdenote this angular velocity. Therefore, by deﬁnition, ωz=1 2/parenleftbiggdθ1 dt+dθ2 dt/parenrightbigg (2.125) Combining Equations (2.123) to (2.125) yields ωz=1 2/parenleftbigg∂v ∂x−∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg (2.126) In the above discussion, we have considered motion in the xyplane only. However, the ﬂuid element is generally moving in three-dimensional space, and its angular velocity is a vector ωthat is oriented in some general direction, as shown in Figure 2.34. In Equation (2.126), we have obtained only the componentofωin the zdirection; this explains the subscript zin Equations (2.125) and (2.126). The xandycomponents of ωcan be obtained in a similar fashion. The resulting angular velocity of the ﬂuid element in three-dimensional space is ω=ω xi+ωyj+ωzk ω=1 2/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg∂w ∂y−∂v ∂z/parenrightbigg i+/parenleftbigg∂u ∂z−∂w ∂x/parenrightbigg j+/parenleftbigg∂v ∂x−∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg k/bracketrightbigg (2.127) Equation (2.127) is the desired result; it expresses the angular velocity of the ﬂuidelement in terms of the velocity ﬁeld, or more precisely, in terms of derivativesof the velocity ﬁeld. The angular velocity of a ﬂuid element plays an important role in theoret- ical aerodynamics, as we shall see soon. However, the expression 2ω appears Figure 2.34 Angular velocity of a ﬂuid element in three-dimensional space.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 169 frequently, and therefore we deﬁne a new quantity, vorticity, which is simply twice the angular velocity. Denote vorticity by the vector ξ: ξ≡2ω Hence, from Equation (2.127), ξ=/parenleftbigg∂w ∂y−∂v ∂z/parenrightbigg i+/parenleftbigg∂u ∂z−∂w ∂x/parenrightbigg j+/parenleftbigg∂v ∂x−∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg k (2.128) Recall Equation (2.22) for ∇×Vin cartesian coordinates. Since u,v, andw denote the x,y, and zcomponents of velocity, respectively, note that the right sides of Equations (2.22) and (2.128) are identical. Hence, we have the important result that ξ=∇ ×V (2.129) In a velocity ﬁeld, the curl of the velocity is equal to the vorticity. The above leads to two important deﬁnitions: 1.If∇×V/negationslash=0 at every point in a ﬂow, the ﬂow is called rotational. This implies that the ﬂuid elements have a ﬁnite angular velocity. 2.If∇×V=0 at every point in a ﬂow, the ﬂow is called irrotational. This implies that the ﬂuid elements have no angular velocity; rather, their motionthrough space is a pure translation. The case of rotational ﬂow is illustrated in Figure 2.35. Here, ﬂuid elementsmoving along two different streamlines are shown in various modes of rotation.In contrast, the case of irrotational ﬂow is illustrated in Figure 2.36. Here, theupper streamline shows a ﬂuid element where the angular velocities of its sides arezero. The lower streamline shows a ﬂuid element where the angular velocities oftwo intersecting sides are ﬁnite but equal and opposite to each other, and so theirsum is identically zero. In both cases, the angular velocity of the ﬂuid element iszero (i.e., the ﬂow is irrotational). Figure 2.35 Fluid elements in a rotational ﬂow.170 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 2.36 Fluid elements in an irrotational ﬂow. If the ﬂow is two-dimensional (say, in the xyplane), then from Equa- tion (2.128), ξ=ξzk=/parenleftbigg∂v ∂x−∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg k (2.130) Also, if the ﬂow is irrotational, ξ=0. Hence, from Equation (2.130), ∂v ∂x−∂u ∂y=0 (2.131) Equation (2.131) is the condition of irrotationality for two-dimensional ﬂow. We will have frequent occasion to use Equation (2.131). Why is it so important to make a distinction between rotational and irrotational ﬂows? The answer becomes blatantly obvious as we progress in our study of aero- dynamics; we ﬁnd that irrotational ﬂows are much easier to analyze than rotationalﬂows. However, irrotational ﬂow may at ﬁrst glance appear to be so special thatits applications are limited. Amazingly enough, such is not the case. There are alarge number of practical aerodynamic problems where the ﬂow ﬁeld is essentiallyirrotational, for example, the subsonic ﬂow over airfoils, the supersonic ﬂow overslender bodies at small angle of attack, and the subsonic-supersonic ﬂow throughnozzles. For such cases, there is generally a thin boundary layer of viscous ﬂowimmediately adjacent to the surface; in this viscous region the ﬂow is highly ro-tational. However, outside this boundary layer, the ﬂow is frequently irrotational.As a result, the study of irrotational ﬂow is an important aspect of aerodynamics. Return to the ﬂuid element shown in Figure 2.33. Let the angle between sides ABandACbe denoted by κ. As the ﬂuid element moves through the ﬂow ﬁeld, κwill change. In Figure 2.33, at time t,κis initially 90 ◦. At time t+/Delta1t,κhas changed by the amount /Delta1κ, where /Delta1κ=−/Delta1θ2−(−/Delta1θ 1) (2.132)CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 171 By deﬁnition, the strain of the ﬂuid element as seen in the xyplane is the change inκ, where positive strain corresponds to a decreasing κ. Hence, from Equa- tion (2.132), Strain =−/Delta1κ=/Delta1θ2−/Delta1θ1 (2.133) In viscous ﬂows (to be discussed in Chapters 15 to 20), the time rate of strain is an important quantity. Denote the time rate of strain by εxy, where in conjunction with Equation (2.133) εxy≡−dκ dt=dθ2 dt−dθ1 dt(2.134) Substituting Equations (2.123) and (2.124) into (2.134), we have εxy=∂v ∂x+∂u ∂y(2.135a) In the yzandzxplanes, by a similar derivation the strain is, respectively, εyz=∂w ∂y+∂v ∂z(2.135b) and εzx=∂u ∂z+∂w ∂x(2.135c) Note that angular velocity (hence, vorticity) and time rate of strain depend solely on the velocity derivatives of the ﬂow ﬁeld. These derivatives can be dis-played in a matrix as follows: ⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣∂u ∂x∂u ∂y∂u ∂z ∂v ∂x∂v ∂y∂v ∂z ∂w ∂x∂w ∂y∂w ∂z⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ The sum of the diagonal terms is simply equal to ∇·V, which from Section 2.3 is equal to the time rate of change of volume of a ﬂuid element; hence, the diagonal terms represent the dilatation of a ﬂuid element. The off-diagonal terms are cross derivatives which appear in Equations (2.127), (2.128), and (2.135 atoc). Hence, the off-diagonal terms are associated with rotation and strain of a ﬂuid element. In summary, in this section, we have examined the rotation and deformation of a ﬂuid element moving in a ﬂow ﬁeld. The angular velocity of a ﬂuid elementand the corresponding vorticity at a point in the ﬂow are concepts that are usefulin the analysis of both inviscid and viscous ﬂows; in particular, the absence ofvorticity—irrotational ﬂow—greatly simpliﬁes the analysis of the ﬂow, as we willsee. We take advantage of this simpliﬁcation in much of our treatment of inviscid172 PART 1Fundamental Principles ﬂows in subsequent chapters. On the other hand, we do not make use of the time rate of strain until Chapter 15.

EXAMPLE 2.6 Consider the boundary-layer velocity proﬁle used in Example 2.2, namely, u/V∞= (y/δ)0.25. Is this ﬂow rotational or irrotational? ■Solution For a two-dimensional ﬂow, the irrotationality condition is given by Equation (2.131), namely ∂v ∂x−∂u ∂y=0. Does this relation hold for the viscous boundary-layer ﬂow in Example 2.2? Let us examinethis question. From the boundary-layer velocity proﬁle given by u V∞=/parenleftBigy δ/parenrightBig0.25 we obtain ∂u ∂y=0.25V∞ δ/parenleftBigy δ/parenrightBig−0.75 (E2.7) What can we say about ∂v/∂ x? In Example 2.2, the ﬂow was incompressible. From the continuity equation for a steady ﬂow given by Equation (2.54), repeated below, ∇·(ρV)=∂(ρu) ∂x+∂(ρv) ∂y=0 we have for an incompressible ﬂow, where ρ=constant, ∂u ∂x+∂v ∂y=0 (E2.8)CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 173 Equation (E2.8) will provide an expression for vas follows: ∂u ∂x=∂ ∂x/bracketleftbigg V∞/parenleftBigy δ/parenrightBig0.25/bracketrightbigg (E2.9) However, from Example 2.2, we stated that δ c=5√Rec This equation holds at any xstation along the plate, not just at x=c.

Inserting this into Equation (E2.8), we have ∂v ∂y=C1/4 yx−9/8 Integrating with respect to y, we have v=C1y5/4x−9/8+C2 (E2.10) where C1is a constant and C2can be a function of x. Evaluating Equation (E2.10) at the wall, where v=0 and y=0, we obtain C2=0. Hence, v=C1y5/4x−9/8174 PART 1Fundamental Principles In turn, we obtain by differentiation ∂v ∂x=C3y5/4x−17/8(E2.11) (Note: vis ﬁnite inside a boundary layer; the streamlines within a boundary are deﬂected upward. However, this “displacement” effect is usually small compared to the running length in the xdirection, and vis of small magnitude in comparison to u. Both of these statements will be veriﬁed in Chapters 17 and 18.)

In Example 2.6, we demonstrated a basic result that holds in general for viscous ﬂows, namely, viscous ﬂows are rotational. This is almost intuitive. For example, consider an inﬁnitesimally small ﬂuid element moving along a stream- line, as sketched in Figure 2.37. If this is a viscous ﬂow, and assuming that thevelocity increases in the upward direction (i.e., the velocity is higher on the neigh-boring streamline above and lower on the neighboring streamline below), thenthe shear stresses on the upper and lower faces of the ﬂuid element will be in thedirections shown. Such shear stresses will be discussed at length in Chapter 15.Examining Figure 2.37, we see clearly that the shear stresses exert a rotationalmoment about the center of the element, thus providing a mechanism for setting Figure 2.37 Shear stress and the consequent rotation of a ﬂuid element.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 175 the ﬂuid element into rotation. Although this picture is overly simplistic, it serves to emphasize that viscous ﬂows are rotational ﬂows. On the other hand, as statedearlier in this section, there are numerous inviscid ﬂow problems that are irro-tational, with the attendant simpliﬁcations to be explained later. Some inviscidﬂows are rotational, but there exist such a large number of practical aerodynamicproblems described by inviscid, irrotational ﬂows that the distinction betweenrotational and irrotational ﬂow is an important consideration. EXAMPLE 2.7 Prove that the inviscid subsonic compressible ﬂow over the wavy wall shown in Figure 2.17 and discussed in Example 2.1 is irrotational. ■Solution This ﬂow is two-dimensional. From Equations (2.128) and (2.129), ∇×V=/parenleftbigg∂v ∂x−∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg k The velocity ﬁeld is given by Equations (2.35) and (2.36) as u=V∞/bracketleftbigg 1+h β2π /lscript/parenleftbigg cos2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript/bracketrightbigg (2.35) and v=−V∞h2π /lscript/parenleftbigg sin2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript(2.36) Differentiating Equation (2.36), we have ∂v ∂x=−V∞h/parenleftbigg2π /lscript/parenrightbigg2/parenleftbigg cos2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript Differentiating Equation (2.35), we have ∂u ∂y=V∞h β2π /lscript/parenleftbigg cos2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript/parenleftbigg −2πβ /lscript/parenrightbigg =− V∞h/parenleftbigg2π /lscript/parenrightbigg2/parenleftbigg cos2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript Thus, ∂v ∂x−∂u ∂y=− V∞h/parenleftbigg2π /lscript/parenrightbigg2/parenleftbigg cos2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript −/bracketleftBigg −V∞h/parenleftbigg2π /lscript/parenrightbigg2/parenleftbigg cos2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript/bracketrightBigg =0176 PART 1Fundamental Principles Hence, ∇×V=/parenleftbigg∂v ∂x−∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg k=0 Conclusion: The inviscid subsonic compression ﬂow over a wavy wall is irrotational. Example 2.7 demonstrates another basic result. Return to Figure 2.17 and examine it closely. Here we have an inviscid ﬂow where the freestream (shown far above the wall) is a uniform ﬂow with velocity V∞. In a uniform ﬂow, ∂u/∂y=∂v/∂ x=0. Therefore, a uniform ﬂow is irrotational. We can view the original source of the ﬂow shown in Figure 2.17 to be the uniform ﬂow shownfar above it, and this original ﬂow is irrotational. Moreover, the whole ﬂow ﬁeldis inviscid, that is, there is no internal friction and no shear stress at the wall tointroduce vorticity in the ﬂow. The ﬂow shown in Figure 2.17, on a physical ba-sis, must therefore remain irrotational throughout. Of course, Example 2.7 provesmathematically that the ﬂow is irrotational throughout. However, this is just an example of a broader concept: A ﬂow ﬁeld that is originally irrotational, withoutany internal mechanisms such as frictional shear stress to generate vorticity, willremain irrotational throughout. This makes sense, does it not? 2.13 CIRCULATION You are reminded again that this is a tool-building chapter. Taken individually,each aerodynamic tool we have developed so far may not be particularly exciting.However, taken collectively, these tools allow us to obtain solutions for some verypractical and exciting aerodynamic problems. In this section, we introduce a tool that is fundamental to the calculation of aerodynamic lift, namely, circulation. This tool was used independently by Frederick Lanchester (1878–1946) in England, Wilhelm Kutta (1867–1944) inGermany, and Nikolai Joukowski (1847–1921) in Russia to create a breakthroughin the theory of aerodynamic lift at the turn of the twentieth century. The rela-tionship between circulation and lift and the historical circumstances surroundingthis breakthrough are discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. The purpose of this sectionis only to deﬁne circulation and relate it to vorticity. Consider a closed curve Cin a ﬂow ﬁeld, as sketched in Figure 2.38. Let V anddsbe the velocity and directed line segment, respectively, at a point on C. The circulation, denoted by /Gamma1, is deﬁned as /Gamma1≡−/contintegraldisplay CV·ds (2.136) The circulation is simply the negative of the line integral of velocity around aclosed curve in the ﬂow; it is a kinematic property depending only on the ve-locity ﬁeld and the choice of the curve C. As discussed in Section 2.2.8, LineCHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 177 Figure 2.38 Deﬁnition of circulation. Integrals, by mathematical convention the positive sense of the line integral is counterclockwise. However, in aerodynamics, it is convenient to consider a posi-tive circulation as being clockwise. Hence, a minus sign appears in the deﬁnitiongiven by Equation (2.136) to account for the positive-counterclockwise sense ofthe integral and the positive-clockwise sense of circulation. 1 The use of the word circulation to label the integral in Equation (2.136) may be somewhat misleading because it leaves a general impression of somethingmoving around in a loop. Indeed, according to the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, the ﬁrst deﬁnition given to the word “circulation” is “movement in a circle or circuit.” However, in aerodynamics, circulation has avery precise technical meaning, namely, Equation (2.136). It does notnecessarily mean that the ﬂuid elements are moving around in circles within this ﬂow ﬁeld—acommon early misconception of new students of aerodynamics. Rather, when cir-culation exists in a ﬂow, it simply means that the line integral in Equation (2.136)is ﬁnite. For example, if the airfoil in Figure 2.28 is generating lift, the circulationtaken around a closed curve enclosing the airfoil will be ﬁnite, although the ﬂuidelements are by no means executing circles around the airfoil (as clearly seenfrom the streamlines sketched in Figure 2.28). Circulation is also related to vorticity as follows. Refer back to Figure 2.11, which shows an open surface bounded by the closed curve C. Assume that the surface is in a ﬂow ﬁeld and the velocity at point PisV, where Pis any point on the surface (including any point on curve C). From Stokes’ theorem [Equation (2.25)], /Gamma1≡−/contintegraldisplay CV·ds=−/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(∇ ×V)·dS (2.137) Hence, the circulation about a curve Cis equal to the vorticity integrated over any open surface bounded by C. This leads to the immediate result that if the ﬂow is 1Some books do not use the minus sign in the deﬁnition of circulation. In such cases, the positive sense of both the line integral and /Gamma1is in the same direction. This causes no problem as long as the reader is aware of the convention used in a particular book or paper.178 PART 1Fundamental Principles /H11002d/H9003d/H9003(/H11612 /H11003 V) · n /H11005 /H11002 /H11612 /H11003 V CPdSdS n Figure 2.39 Relation between vorticity and circulation. irrotational everywhere within the contour of integration (i.e., if ∇×V=0 over any surface bounded by C),then/Gamma1=0. A related result is obtained by letting the curve Cshrink to an inﬁnitesimal size, and denoting the circulation around this inﬁnitesimally small curve by d/Gamma1. Then, in the limit as Cbecomes inﬁnitesimally small, Equation (2.137) yields d/Gamma1=−(∇ ×V)·dS=−(∇ ×V)·ndS or (∇ ×V)·n=−d/Gamma1 dS(2.138) where dSis the inﬁnitesimal area enclosed by the inﬁnitesimal curve C. Referring to Figure 2.39, Equation (2.138) states that at a point Pin a ﬂow, the component of vorticity normal to dSis equal to the negative of the “circulation per unit area,” where the circulation is taken around the boundary of dS. EXAMPLE 2.8 For the velocity ﬁeld given in Example 2.4, calculate the circulation around a circular path of radius 5 m. Assume that uandvgiven in Example 2.4 are in units of meters per second. ■Solution Since we are dealing with a circular path, it is easier to work this problem in polarcoordinates, where x=rcosθ,y=rsinθ,x 2+y2=r2,Vr=ucosθ+vsinθ, and Vθ=−usinθ+vcosθ.

Recall from Section 2.11 that the differential equation for a streamline in such a ﬂow is given by Equa-tion (2.118), repeated below dy dx=v u(2.118) Ifuandvare known functions of xandy, then Equation (2.118) can be integrated to yield the algebraic equation for a streamline: f(x,y)=c (2.139) where cis an arbitrary constant of integration, with different values for different streamlines. In Equation (2.139), denote the function of xandyby the symbol ¯ψ. Hence, Equation (2.139) is written as ¯ψ(x,y)=c (2.140) The function ¯ψ(x,y)is called the stream function. From Equation (2.140) we see that the equation for a streamline is given by setting the stream function equal to a constant (i.e., c1,c2,c3, etc.). Two different streamlines are illustrated in Figure 2.40; streamlines abandcdare given by ¯ψ=c1and ¯ψ=c2, respectively. There is a certain arbitrariness in Equations (2.139) and (2.140) via the arbi- trary constant of integration c. Let us deﬁne the stream function more precisely in order to reduce this arbitrariness. Referring to Figure 2.40, let us deﬁne the Figure 2.40 Different streamlines are given by different values of the stream function.180 PART 1Fundamental Principles numerical value of ¯ψsuch that the difference /Delta1¯ψbetween ¯ψ=c2for streamline cdand ¯ψ=c1for streamline abis equal to the mass ﬂow between the two streamlines. Since Figure 2.40 is a two-dimensional ﬂow, the mass ﬂow between two streamlines is deﬁned per unit depth perpendicular to the page. That is, in Figure 2.40 we are considering the mass ﬂow inside a streamtube bounded bystreamlines abandcd, with a rectangular cross-sectional area equal to /Delta1ntimes a unit depth perpendicular to the page. Here, /Delta1nis the normal distance between abandcd, as shown in Figure 2.40. Hence, mass ﬂow between streamlines ab andcdper unit depth perpendicular to the page is /Delta1¯ψ=c 2−c1 (2.141) The above deﬁnition does not completely remove the arbitrariness of the constantof integration in Equations (2.139) and (2.140), but it does make things a bit moreprecise. For example, consider a given two-dimensional ﬂow ﬁeld. Choose onestreamline of the ﬂow, and give it an arbitrary value of the stream function, say, ¯ψ=c Then, the value of the stream function for any other streamline in the ﬂow, say, ¯ψ=c2, is ﬁxed by the deﬁnition given in Equation (2.141). Which streamline you choose to designate as ¯ψ=c1and what numerical value you give c1usually depend on the geometry of the given ﬂow ﬁeld, as we see in Chapter 3. The equivalence between ¯ψ=constant designating a streamline, and /Delta1¯ψ equaling mass ﬂow (per unit depth) between streamlines, is natural. For a steadyﬂow, the mass ﬂow inside a given streamtube is constant along the tube; the massﬂow across any cross section of the tube is the same. Since by deﬁnition /Delta1¯ψ is equal to this mass ﬂow, then /Delta1¯ψitself is constant for a given streamtube. In Figure 2.40, if ¯ψ 1=c1designates the streamline on the bottom of the streamtube, then ¯ψ2=c2=c1+/Delta1¯ψis also constant along the top of the streamtube. Since by deﬁnition of a streamtube (see Section 2.11) the upper boundary of the streamtubeis a streamline itself, then ψ 2=c2=constant must designate this streamline. We have yet to develop the most important property of the stream function, namely, derivatives of ¯ψyield the ﬂow-ﬁeld velocities. To obtain this relationship, consider again the streamlines abandcdin Figure 2.40. Assume that these streamlines are close together (i.e., assume /Delta1nis small), such that the ﬂow velocity Vis a constant value across /Delta1n. The mass ﬂow through the streamtube per unit depth perpendicular to the page is /Delta1¯ψ≡ρV/Delta1n(1) or/Delta1¯ψ /Delta1n=ρV (2.142) Consider the limit of Equation (2.142) as /Delta1n→0: ρV=lim /Delta1n→0/Delta1¯ψ /Delta1n≡∂¯ψ ∂n(2.143)CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 181 Figure 2.41 Mass ﬂow through /Delta1nis the sum of the mass ﬂows through /Delta1yand−/Delta1x. Equation (2.143) states that if we know ¯ψ, then we can obtain the product (ρV) by differentiating ¯ψin the direction normal toV. To obtain a practical form of Equation (2.143) for cartesian coordinates, consider Figure 2.41. Notice that the directed normal distance /Delta1nis equivalent ﬁrst to moving upward in the ydirection by the amount /Delta1yand then to the left in the negative xdirection by the amount −/Delta1x. Due to conservation of mass, the mass ﬂow through /Delta1n(per unit depth) is equal to the sum of the mass ﬂows through /Delta1yand−/Delta1x(per unit depth): Mass ﬂow =/Delta1¯ψ=ρV/Delta1n=ρu/Delta1y+ρv(−/Delta1x) (2.144) Letting cdapproach ab, Equation (2.144) becomes in the limit d¯ψ=ρudy−ρvdx (2.145) However, since ¯ψ=¯ψ(x,y), the chain rule of calculus states d¯ψ=∂¯ψ ∂xdx+∂¯ψ ∂ydy (2.146) Comparing Equations (2.145) and (2.146), we have (2.147a) ρu=∂¯ψ ∂y ρv=−∂¯ψ ∂x(2.147b) Equations (2.147 aandb) are important. If ¯ψ(x,y)is known for a given ﬂow ﬁeld, then at any point in the ﬂow the products ρuandρvcan be obtained by differentiating ¯ψin the directions normal to uandv, respectively.182 PART 1Fundamental Principles If Figure 2.41 were to be redrawn in terms of polar coordinates, then a similar derivation yields (2.148a)ρVr=1 r∂¯ψ ∂θ ρVθ=−∂¯ψ ∂r(2.148b) Such a derivation is left as a homework problem. Note that the dimensions of ¯ψare equal to mass ﬂow per unit depth perpen- dicular to the page. That is, in SI units, ¯ψis in terms of kilograms per second per meter perpendicular to the page, or simply kg/(s ·m). The stream function ¯ψdeﬁned above applies to both compressible and in- compressible ﬂow. Now consider the case of incompressible ﬂow only, where ρ=constant. Equation (2.143) can be written as V=∂(¯ψ/ρ) ∂n(2.149) We deﬁne a new stream function, for incompressible ﬂow only, as ψ≡¯ψ/ρ. Then Equation (2.149) becomes V=∂ψ ∂n and Equations (2.147) and (2.148) become (2.150a)u=∂ψ ∂y v=−∂ψ ∂x (2.150b) and (2.151a)Vr=1 r∂ψ ∂θ Vθ=−∂ψ ∂r(2.151b) The incompressible stream function ψhas characteristics analogous to its more general compressible counterpart ¯ψ. For example, since ¯ψ(x,y)=cis the equation of a streamline, and since ρis a constant for incompressible ﬂow, then ψ(x,y)≡¯ψ/ρ=constant is also the equation for a streamline (for incompress- ible ﬂow only). In addition, since /Delta1¯ψis mass ﬂow between two streamlines (per unit depth perpendicular to the page), and since ρis mass per unit volume, then physically /Delta1ψ=/Delta1¯ψ/ρ represents the volume ﬂow (per unit depth) between two streamlines. In SI units, /Delta1ψ is expressed as cubic meters per second per meter perpendicular to the page, or simply m2/s.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 183 In summary, the concept of the stream function is a powerful tool in aerody- namics, for two primary reasons. Assuming that ¯ψ(x,y)[orψ(x,y)] is known through the two-dimensional ﬂow ﬁeld, then: ¯ψ=constant (or ψ=constant) gives the equation of a streamline. 2.The ﬂow velocity can be obtained by differentiating ¯ψ(orψ), as given by Equations (2.147) and (2.148) for compressible ﬂow and Equations (2.150) and (2.151) for incompressible ﬂow. We have not yet discussed how ¯ψ(x,y)[orψ(x,y)] can be obtained in the ﬁrst place; we are assuming that it is known. The actual determination of the stream function for variousproblems is discussed in Chapter 3. 2.15 VELOCITY POTENTIAL Recall from Section 2.12 that an irrotational ﬂow is deﬁned as a ﬂow where thevorticity is zero at every point. From Equation (2.129), for an irrotational ﬂow, ξ=∇ ×V=0 (2.152) Consider the following vector identity: if φis a scalar function, then ∇×(∇φ)=0 (2.153) that is, the curl of the gradient of a scalar function is identically zero. ComparingEquations (2.152) and (2.153), we see that V=∇φ (2.154) Equation (2.154) states that for an irrotational ﬂow, there exists a scalar function φsuch that the velocity is given by the gradient of φ. We denote φas the velocity potential. φis a function of the spatial coordinates; that is, φ=φ(x,y,z), or φ=φ(r,θ,z), orφ=φ(r,θ,/Phi1 ) . From the deﬁnition of the gradient in cartesian coordinates given by Equation (2.16), we have, from Equation (2.154), ui+vj+wk=∂φ ∂xi+∂φ ∂yj+∂φ ∂zk (2.155) The coefﬁcients of like unit vectors must be the same on both sides of Equa-tion (2.155). Thus, in cartesian coordinates, u=∂φ ∂xv=∂φ ∂yw=∂φ ∂z(2.156) In a similar fashion, from the deﬁnition of the gradient in cylindrical and spher-ical coordinates given by Equations (2.17) and (2.18), we have, in cylindricalcoordinates, V r=∂φ ∂rVθ=1 r∂φ ∂θVz=∂φ ∂z(2.157)184 PART 1Fundamental Principles and in spherical coordinates, Vr=∂φ ∂rVθ=1 r∂φ ∂θV/Phi1=1 rsinθ∂φ ∂/Phi1(2.158) The velocity potential is analogous to the stream function in the sense that derivatives of φyield the ﬂow-ﬁeld velocities. However, there are distinct differ- ences between φand ¯ψ(orψ): 1.The ﬂow-ﬁeld velocities are obtained by differentiating φin the same direction as the velocities [see Equations (2.156) to (2.158)], whereas ¯ψ (orψ) is differentiated normal to the velocity direction [see Equations (2.147) and (2.148), or Equations (2.150) and (2.151)]. 2.The velocity potential is deﬁned for irrotational ﬂow only. In contrast, the stream function can be used in either rotational or irrotational ﬂows. 3.The velocity potential applies to three-dimensional ﬂows, whereas thestream function is deﬁned for two-dimensional ﬂows only. 2 When a ﬂow ﬁeld is irrotational, hence allowing a velocity potential to be deﬁned, there is a tremendous simpliﬁcation. Instead of dealing with the veloc-ity components (say, u,v, andw) as unknowns, hence requiring three equations for these three unknowns, we can deal with the velocity potential as one un-known, therefore requiring the solution of only one equation for the ﬂow ﬁeld.Onceφis known for a given problem, the velocities are obtained directly from Equations (2.156) to (2.158). This is why, in theoretical aerodynamics, we makea distinction between irrotational and rotational ﬂows and why the analysis ofirrotational ﬂows is simpler than that of rotational ﬂows. Because irrotational ﬂows can be described by the velocity potential φ, such ﬂows are called potential ﬂows. In this section, we have not yet discussed how φcan be obtained in the ﬁrst place; we are assuming that it is known. The actual determination of φfor various problems is discussed in Chapters 3, 6, 11, and 12. EXAMPLE 2.9 Calculate the velocity potential for the ﬂow ﬁeld over a wavy wall given in Example 2.1. ■Solution From Example 2.1, the equations for uandvare given by u=V∞/bracketleftbigg 1+h β2π /lscript/parenleftbigg cos2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript/bracketrightbigg (2.35) 2¯ψ(orψ) can be deﬁned for axisymmetric ﬂows, such as the ﬂow over a cone at zero degrees angle of attack. However, for such ﬂows, only two spatial coordinates are needed to describe the ﬂow ﬁeld (see Chapter 6).CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 185 and v=−V∞h2π /lscript/parenleftbigg sin2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript(2.36) From Equation (2.156), u=∂φ ∂xandv=∂φ ∂y To ﬁnd an expression for φ, we ﬁrst integrate uwith respect to xand then integrate vwith respect to y, as follows φ=/integraldisplay∂φ ∂xdx=/integraldisplay udx (E2.13) Substituting Equation (2.35) into (E2.13), we have φ=/integraldisplay/bracketleftbigg V∞+V∞h β2π /lscript/parenleftbigg cos2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript/bracketrightbigg dx φ=V∞x+V∞h β2π /lscript/parenleftbigg sin2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg2π /lscript/parenrightbigg−1 e−2πβ y//lscript φ=V∞x+V∞h β/parenleftbigg sin2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript+f(y) (E2.14) The function of f(y)is added to Equation (E2.14) in the spirit of a “constant of integra- tion” since Equation (E2.13) is an integral just with respect to x. Indeed, since u=∂φ ∂x, when Equation (E2.14) is differentiated with respect to x, the derivative of f(y)with respect to xis zero, and we recover Equation (2.35) for u. Also, we have φ=/integraldisplay∂φ ∂ydy=/integraldisplay vdy (E2.15) Substituting Equation (2.36) into (E2.15), we have φ=/integraldisplay/bracketleftbigg −V∞h2π /lscript/parenleftbigg sin2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript/bracketrightbigg dy φ=− V∞h2π /lscript/parenleftbigg sin2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript/parenleftbigg −/lscript ∂πβ/parenrightbigg φ=V∞h β/parenleftbigg sin2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript+g(x) (E2.16) where g(x)in Equation (E2.16) is again a “constant of integration” since Equation (E2.15) is an integral just with respect to y. When Equation (E2.16) is differentiated with respect toy, the derivative of g(x)with respect to yis zero, and we recover Equation (2.36) for v. Compare Equations (E2.14) and (E2.16). These are two equations for the same veloc- ity potential. Hence, in Equation (E2.14), f(y)=0 and in Equation (E2.16), g(x)=V∞x. Thus, the velocity potential for the ﬂow over the wavy wall in Example 2.1 is φ=V∞x+V∞h β/parenleftbigg sin2πx /lscript/parenrightbigg e−2πβ y//lscript(E2.17)186 PART 1Fundamental Principles Recall that a velocity potential exists for any irrotational ﬂow. In Example 2.7 we proved that the ﬂow ﬁeld over the wavy wall shown in Figure 2.17 as speciﬁed in Example 2.1 isirrotational. Hence a velocity potential exists for that ﬂow. Equation (E2.17) is the velocitypotential. 2.16 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STREAM FUNCTION AND VELOCITY POTENTIAL In Section 2.15, we demonstrated that for an irrotational ﬂow V=∇φ. At this stage, take a moment and review some of the nomenclature introduced in Section 2.2.5 for the gradient of a scalar ﬁeld. We see that a line of constantφis an isoline of φ; since φis the velocity potential, we give this isoline a speciﬁc name, equipotential line. In addition, a line drawn in space such that ∇φ is tangent at every point is deﬁned as a gradient line; however, since ∇φ=V, this gradient line is a streamline. In turn, from Section 2.14, a streamline is a line of constant ¯ψ(for a two-dimensional ﬂow). Because gradient lines and isolines are perpendicular (see Section 2.2.5, Gradient of a Scalar Field), then equipotentiallines (φ =constant) and streamlines ( ¯ψ=constant) are mutually perpendicular. To illustrate this result more clearly, consider a two-dimensional, irrota- tional, incompressible ﬂow in cartesian coordinates. For a streamline, ψ(x,y)= constant. Hence, the differential of ψalong the streamline is zero; that is, dψ=∂ψ ∂xdx+∂ψ ∂ydy=0 (2.159) From Equations (2.150 aandb), Equation (2.159) can be written as dψ=−vdx+udy=0 (2.160) Solve Equation (2.160) for dy/dx, which is the slope of the ψ=constant line, that is, the slope of the streamline: /parenleftbiggdy dx/parenrightbigg ψ=const=v u(2.161) Similarly, for an equipotential line, φ(x,y)=constant. Along this line, dφ=∂φ ∂xdx+∂φ ∂ydy=0 (2.162) From Equation (2.156), Equation (2.162) can be written as dφ=udx+vdy=0 (2.163) Solving Equation (2.163) for dy/dx, which is the slope of the φ=constant line (i.e., the slope of the equipotential line), we obtain /parenleftbiggdy dx/parenrightbigg φ=const=−u v(2.164)CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 187 Combining Equations (2.161) and (2.164), we have /parenleftbiggdy dx/parenrightbigg ψ=const=−1 (dy/dx)φ=const(2.165) Equation (2.165) shows that the slope of a ψ=constant line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of a φ=constant line (i.e., streamlines and equipotential lines are mutually perpendicular). 2.17 HOW DO WE SOLVE THE EQUATIONS? This chapter is full of mathematical equations—equations that represent the basic physical fundamentals that dictate the characteristics of aerodynamic ﬂow ﬁelds.For the most part, the equations are either in partial differential form or integralform. These equations are powerful and by themselves represent a sophisticatedintellectual construct of our understanding of the fundamentals of a ﬂuid ﬂow.However, the equations by themselves are not very practical. They must be solved in order to obtain the actual ﬂow ﬁelds over speciﬁc body shapes with speciﬁcﬂow conditions. For example, if we are interested in calculating the ﬂow ﬁeldaround a Boeing 777 jet transport ﬂying at a velocity of 800 ft/s at an altitude of30,000 ft, we have to obtain a solution of the governing equations for this case—a solution that will give us the results for the dependent ﬂow-ﬁeld variables p,ρ, V, etc., as a function of the independent variables of spatial location and time.Then we have to squeeze this solution for extra practical information, such as lift,drag, and moments exerted on the vehicle. How do we do this? The purpose ofthe present section is to discuss two philosophical answers to this question. Asfor practical solutions to speciﬁc problems of interest, there are literally hundredsof different answers to this question, many of which make up the content of therest of this book. However, all these solutions fall under one or the other of thetwo philosophical approaches described next. 2.17.1 Theoretical (Analytical) Solutions Students learning any ﬁeld of physical science or engineering at the beginningare usually introduced to nice, neat analytical solutions to physical problems thatare simpliﬁed to the extent that such solutions are possible. For example, whenNewton’s second law is applied to the motion of a simple, frictionless pendulum,students in elementary physics classes are shown a closed-form analytical solutionfor the time period of the pendulum’s oscillation, namely, T=2π /radicalbig /lscript/g where Tis the period, /lscriptis the length of the pendulum, and gis the acceleration of gravity. However, a vital assumption behind this equation is that of small amplitude oscillations. Similarly, in studying the motion of a freely falling body in a gravitational ﬁeld, the distance ythrough which the body falls in time tafter188 PART 1Fundamental Principles release is given by y=1 2gt2 However, this result neglects any aerodynamic drag on the body as it falls through the air. The above examples are given because they are familiar results fromelementary physics. They are examples of theoretical, closed-form solutions—straightforward algebraic relations. The governing equations of aerodynamics, such as the continuity, momen- tum, and energy equations derived in Sections 2.4, 2.5, and 2.7, respectively, arehighly nonlinear, partial differential, or integral equations; to date, no general an-alytical solution to these equations has been obtained. In lieu of this, two differentphilosophies have been followed in obtaining useful solutions to these equations.One of these is the theoretical, or analytical, approach, wherein the physical natureof certain aerodynamic applications allows the governing equations to be sim-pliﬁed to a sufﬁcient extent that analytical solutions of the simpliﬁed equationscan be obtained. One such example is the analysis of the ﬂow across a normalshock wave, as discussed in Chapter 8. This ﬂow is one-dimensional, that is, thechanges in ﬂow properties across the shock take place only in the ﬂow direction.For this case, the yandzderivatives in the governing continuity, momentum, and energy equations from Sections 2.4, 2.5, and 2.7 are identically zero, and the re-sulting one-dimensional equations, which are still exact for the one-dimensional case being considered, lend themselves to a direct analytical solution, which isindeed an exact solution for the shock wave properties. Another example is thecompressible ﬂow over an airfoil considered in Chapters 11 and 12. If the airfoilis thin and at a small angle of attack, and if the freestream Mach number is notnear one (not transonic) nor above ﬁve (not hypersonic), then many of the termsin the governing equations are small compared to others and can be neglected.The resulting simpliﬁed equations are linear and can be solved analytically. Thisis an example of an approximate solution, where certain simplifying assumptions have been made in order to obtain a solution. The history of the development of aerodynamic theory is in this category— the simpliﬁcation of the full governing equations apropos a given applicationso that analytical solutions can be obtained. Of course this philosophy works foronly a limited number of aerodynamic problems. However, classical aerodynamictheory is built on this approach and, as such, is discussed at some length inthis book. You can expect to see a lot of closed-form analytical solutions in thesubsequent chapters, along with detailed discussions of their limitations due tothe approximations necessary to obtain such solutions. In the modern world ofaerodynamics, such classical analytical solutions have three advantages: 1.The act of developing these solutions puts you in intimate contact with all the physics involved in the problem. 2.The results, usually in closed form, give you direct information on what arethe important variables, and how the answers vary with increases ordecreases in these variables. For example, in Chapter 11 we will obtain aCHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 189 simple equation for the compressibility effects on lift coefﬁcient for an airfoil in high-speed subsonic ﬂow. The equation, Equation (11.52), tells usthat the high-speed effect on lift coefﬁcient is governed by just M ∞alone, and that as M∞increases, then the lift coefﬁcient increases. Moreover, the equation tells us in what way the lift coefﬁcient increases, namely, inversely with(1−M2 ∞)1/2. This is powerful information, albeit approximate. 3.Finally, the results in closed form provide simple tools for rapidcalculations, making possible the proverbial “back of the envelopecalculations” so important in the preliminary design process and in otherpractical applications. 2.17.2 Numerical Solutions—Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) The other general approach to the solution of the governing equations is numerical.The advent of the modern high-speed digital computer in the last third of thetwentieth century has revolutionized the solution of aerodynamic problems andhas given rise to a whole new discipline—computational ﬂuid dynamics. Recallthat the basic governing equations of continuity, momentum, and energy derivedin this chapter are either in integral or partial differential form. In Anderson,Computational Fluid Dynamics: The Basics with Applications, McGraw-Hill, 1995, computational ﬂuid dynamics is deﬁned as “the art of replacing the integralsor the partial derivatives (as the case may be) in these equations with discretizedalgebraic forms, which in turn are solved to obtain numbers for the ﬂow ﬁeld values at discrete points in time and/or space.” The end product of computationalﬂuid dynamics (frequently identiﬁed by the acronym CFD) is indeed a collectionof numbers, in contrast to a closed-form analytical solution. However, in the longrun, the objective of most engineering analyses, closed form or otherwise, is aquantitative description of the problem (i.e., numbers). The beauty of CFD is that it can deal with the full nonlinear equations of con- tinuity, momentum, and energy, in principle, without resorting to any geometricalor physical approximations. Because of this, many complex aerodynamic ﬂowﬁelds have been solved by means of CFD which had never been solved before. Anexample of this is shown in Figure 2.42. Here we see the unsteady, viscous, turbu-lent, compressible, separated ﬂow ﬁeld over an airfoil at high angle of attack (14 ◦ in the case shown), as obtained from Reference 53. The freestream Mach numberis 0.5, and the Reynolds number based on the airfoil chord length (distance fromthe front to the back edges) is 300,000. An instantaneous streamline pattern thatexists at a certain instant in time is shown, reﬂecting the complex nature of theseparated, recirculating ﬂow above the airfoil. This ﬂow is obtained by meansof a CFD solution of the two-dimensional, unsteady continuity, momentum, andenergy equations, including the full effects of viscosity and thermal conduction,as developed in Sections 2.4, 2.5, and 2.7, without any further geometrical or physical simpliﬁcations. The equations with all the viscosity and thermal con-duction terms explicitly shown are developed in Chapter 15; in this form, they arefrequently labeled as the Navier-Stokes equations. There is no analytical solution190 PART 1Fundamental Principles Figure 2.42 Calculated streamline pattern for separated ﬂow over an airfoil. Re =300,000, M∞=0.5, angle of attack =14◦. for the ﬂow shown in Figure 2.42; the solution can only be obtained by means of CFD. Let us explore the basic philosophy behind CFD. Again, keep in mind that CFD solutions are completely numerical solutions, and a high-speed digital com- puter must be used to carry them out. In a CFD solution, the ﬂow ﬁeld is dividedinto a number of discrete points. Coordinate lines through these points generate agrid, and the discrete points are called grid points. The grid used to solve the ﬂow ﬁeld shown in Figure 2.42 is given in Figure 2.43; here, the grid is wrappedaround the airfoil, which is seen as the small white speck in the center-left of theﬁgure, and the grid extends a very large distance out from the airfoil. This largeextension of the grid into the main stream of the ﬂow is necessary for a subsonicﬂow, because disturbances in a subsonic ﬂow physically feed out large distancesaway from the body. We will learn why in subsequent chapters. The black regionnear the airfoil is simply the computer graphics way of showing a very largenumber of closely spaced grid points near the airfoil, for better deﬁnition of theviscous ﬂow near the airfoil. The ﬂow ﬁeld properties, such as p,ρ,u,v, etc., are calculated just at the discrete grid points, and nowhere else, by means of thenumerical solution of the governing ﬂow equations. This is an inherent propertythat distinguishes CFD solutions from closed-form analytical solutions. Analyti-cal solutions, by their very nature, yield closed-form equations that describe theﬂow as a function of continuous time and/or space. So we can pick any one of theinﬁnite number of points located in this continuous space, feed the coordinatesinto the closed-form equations, and obtain the ﬂow variables at that point. Notso with CFD, where the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables are calculated only at discrete gridpoints. For a CFD solution, the partial derivatives or the integrals, as the case maybe, in the governing ﬂow equations are discretized, using the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables at grid points only.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 191 Figure 2.43 The grid used for the numerical solution of the ﬂow over the airfoil in Figure 2.40.

How is this discretization carried out? There are many answers to this equa- tion. We will look at just a few examples, to convey the ideas. Let us consider a partial derivative, such as ∂u/∂x. How do we discretize this partial derivative? First, we choose a uniform rectangular array of grid points as shown in Figure 2.44. The points are identiﬁed by the index iin the xdirection, and the index jin the ydirection. Point Pin Figure 2.44 is identiﬁed as point (i,j). The value of the variable uat point jis denoted by ui,j. The value of uat the point immediately to the right of Pis denoted by ui+1,jand that immediately192 PART 1Fundamental Principles to the left of Pbyui−1,j. The values of uat the points immediately above and below point Pare denoted by ui,j+1andui,j−1, respectively. And so forth. The grid points in the xdirection are separated by the increment /Delta1x, and the ydirection by the increment /Delta1y. The increments /Delta1xand/Delta1ymust be uniform between the grid points, but /Delta1xcan be a different value than /Delta1y. To obtain a discretized expression for∂u/∂xevaluated at point P, we ﬁrst write a Taylor series expansion for ui+1,j expanded about point Pas: ui+1,j=ui,j+/parenleftbigg∂u ∂x/parenrightbigg i,j/Delta1x+/parenleftbigg∂2u ∂x2/parenrightbigg i,j(/Delta1x)2 2+/parenleftbigg∂3u ∂x3/parenrightbigg i,j(/Delta1x)3 6 +/parenleftbigg∂4u ∂x4/parenrightbigg i,j(/Delta1x)4 24+···(2.166) Solving Equation (2.166) (∂u/∂x)i,j, we have /parenleftbigg∂u ∂x/parenrightbigg i,j=ui+1,j−ui,j /Delta1x/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright Forward difference−/parenleftbigg∂2u ∂x2/parenrightbigg i,j/Delta1x 2−/parenleftbigg∂3u ∂x3/parenrightbigg i,j(/Delta1x)2 6+··· /bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright Truncation error(2.167) Equation (2.167) is still a mathematically exact relationship. However, if we choose to represent (∂u/∂x)i,jjust by the algebraic term on the right-hand side, namely, /parenleftbigg∂u ∂x/parenrightbigg i,j=ui+1,j−ui,j /Delta1xForward difference (2.168) then Equation (2.168) represents an approximation for the partial derivative, where the error introduced by this approximation is the truncation error, iden-tiﬁed in Equation (2.167). Nevertheless, Equation (2.168) gives us an algebraicexpression for the partial derivative; the partial derivative has been discretized because it is formed by the values u i+1,jandui,jatdiscrete grid points. The algebraic difference quotient in Equation (2.168) is called a forward difference, because it uses information ahead of point (i,j), namely ui+1,j. Also, the for- ward difference given by Equation (2.168) has ﬁrst-order accuracy because the leading term of the truncation error in Equation (2.167) has /Delta1xto the ﬁrst power. Equation (2.168) is not the only discretized form for (∂u/∂x)i,j. For example, let us write a Taylor series expansion for ui−1,jexpanded about point Pas ui−1,j=ui,j+/parenleftbigg∂u ∂x/parenrightbigg i,j(−/Delta1 x)+/parenleftbigg∂2u ∂x2/parenrightbigg i,j(−/Delta1 x)2 2 (2.169) +/parenleftbigg∂3u ∂x3/parenrightbigg i,j(−/Delta1 x)3 6+···CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 193 Solving Equation (2.169) for (∂u/∂x)i,j, we have /parenleftbigg∂u ∂x/parenrightbigg i,j=ui,j−ui−1,j /Delta1x/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright Rearward difference+/parenleftbigg∂2u ∂x2/parenrightbigg i,j/Delta1x 2−/parenleftbigg∂3u ∂x3/parenrightbigg i,j(/Delta1x)2 6+··· /bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright Truncation error(2.170) Hence, we can represent the partial derivative by the rearward difference shown in Equation (2.170), namely, /parenleftbigg∂u ∂x/parenrightbigg i,j=ui,j−ui−1,j /Delta1xRearward difference (2.171) Equation (2.171) is an approximation for the partial derivative, where the erroris given by the truncation error labeled in Equation (2.170). The rearward dif-ference given by Equation (2.171) has ﬁrst-order accuracy because the leadingterm in the truncation error in Equation (2.170) has /Delta1xto the ﬁrst power. The forward and rearward differences given by Equations (2.168) and (2.171), re-spectively, are equally valid representations of (∂u/∂x) i,j, each with ﬁrst-order accuracy. In most CFD solutions, ﬁrst-order accuracy is not good enough; we need a discretization of (∂u/∂x)i,jthat has at least second-order accuracy. This can be obtained by subtracting Equation (2.169) from Equation (2.166), yielding ui+1,j−ui−1,j=2/parenleftbigg∂u ∂x/parenrightbigg i,j/Delta1x+/parenleftbigg∂3u ∂x3/parenrightbigg i,j(/Delta1x)3 3+··· (2.172) Solving Equation (2.172) for (∂u/∂x)i,j, we have /parenleftbigg∂u ∂x/parenrightbigg i,j=ui+1,j−ui−1,j 2/Delta1x/bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright Central difference−/parenleftbigg∂3u ∂x3/parenrightbigg i,j(/Delta1x)2 3+··· /bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright Truncation error(2.173) Hence, we can represent the partial derivative by the central difference shown in Equation (2.173), namely /parenleftbigg∂u ∂x/parenrightbigg i,j=ui+1,j−ui−1,j 2/Delta1xCentral difference (2.174) Examining Equation (2.173), we see that the central difference expression givenin Equation (2.174) has second-order accuracy, because the leading term in the truncation error in Equation (2.173) has (/Delta1x) For most CFD solutions, second- order accuracy is sufﬁcient. So this is how it works—this is how the partial derivatives that appear in the governing ﬂow equations can be discretized. There are many other possiblediscretized forms for the derivatives; the forward, rearward, and central differ-ences obtained above are just a few. Note that Taylor series have been used toobtain these discrete forms. Such Taylor series expressions are the basic foun-dation of ﬁnite-difference solutions in CFD. In contrast, if the integral form of194 PART 1Fundamental Principles the governing ﬂow equations are used, such as Equations (2.48) and (2.64), the individual integrals terms can be discretized, leading again to algebraic equationsthat are the basic foundation of ﬁnite-volume solutions in CFD. EXAMPLE 2.10 Consider a one-dimensional, unsteady ﬂow, where the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables such as ρ,u, etc. are functions of distance xand time t. Consider the grid shown in Figure 2.45, where grid points arrayed in the xdirection are denoted by the index i. Two rows of grid points are shown, one at time tand the other at the later time t+/Delta1t. In particular, we are interested in calculating the unknown density at grid point iat time t+/Delta1t, denoted by ρt+/Delta1t i. Set up the calculation of this unknown density. ■Solution Note in Figure 2.45 that the dashed loop (called the computational module) contain the grid points i−1,i, and i+1 at time t, where the ﬂow ﬁeld is known, and the grid point iat time t+/Delta1t, where the ﬂow ﬁeld is unknown. From the continuity equation, Equation (2.52), repeated below ∂ρ ∂t+∇ ·(ρV)=0 (2.52) written for unsteady, one-dimensional ﬂow, we have ∂ρ ∂t+∂(ρu) ∂x=0 (2.175) Rearranging Equation (2.175), ∂ρ ∂t=−∂(ρu) ∂x or∂ρ ∂t=−ρ∂u ∂x−u∂ρ ∂x(2.176) t t + Δ t t xΔt Δxi – 1 ii + 1 i – 1 ii + 1unknown known Figure 2.45 Computational module.

Solving Equation (2.177) for ρ t+/Delta1t i ρt+/Delta1t i=ρt i−/Delta1t 2/Delta1x/parenleftbig ρt iut i+1−ρt iut i−1+ut iρt i+1−ut iρt i−1/parenrightbig (2.178) In Equation (2.178), all quantities on the right-hand side are known values at time t. Hence, Equation (2.178) allows the direct calculation of the unknown value, ρt+/Delta1t i, at time t+/Delta1t. This example is a simple illustration of how a CFD solution to a given ﬂow can be set up, in this case for an unsteady, one-dimensional ﬂow. Note that the un- known velocity and internal energy at grid point iat time t+/Delta1tcan be calculated in the same manner, writing the appropriate difference equation representationsfor the xcomponent of the momentum equation, Equation (2.113 a), and the energy equation, Equation (2.114). The above example looks very straightforward, and indeed it is. It is given here only as an illustration of what is meant by a CFD technique. However,do not be misled. Computational ﬂuid dynamics is a sophisticated and complexdiscipline. For example, we have said nothing here about the accuracy of the ﬁnalsolutions, whether or not a certain computational technique will be stable (someattempts at obtaining numerical solutions will go unstable—blow up—duringthe course of the calculations), and how much computer time a given techniquewill require to obtain the ﬂow-ﬁeld solution. Also, in our discussion we havegiven examples of some relatively simple grids. The generation of an appropriategrid for a given ﬂow problem is frequently a challenge, and grid generation hasemerged as a subdiscipline in its own right within CFD. For these reasons, CFDis usually taught only in graduate-level courses in most universities. However,in an effort to introduce some of the basic ideas of CFD at the undergraduatelevel, I have written a book, Reference 7, intended to present the subject at themost elementary level. Reference 7 is intended to be read before students go on to the more advanced books on CFD written at the graduate level. In the presentbook, we will, from time to time, discuss some applications of CFD as part ofthe overall fundamentals of aerodynamics. However, this book is not about CFD;Reference 7 is.196 PART 1Fundamental Principles Pure experiment Pure theory Computational fluid dynamics Figure 2.46 The three equal partners of modern aerodynamics. 2.17.3 The Bigger Picture The evolution of our intellectual understanding of aerodynamics is over 2500 years old, going all the way back to ancient Greek science. The aerodynamics you arestudying in this book is the product of this evolution. (See Reference 68 for an in-depth study of the history of aerodynamics.) Relevant to our current discussion isthe development of the experimental tradition in ﬂuid dynamics, which took placein the middle of the seventeenth century, principally in France, and the introduc-tion of rational analysis in mechanics pioneered by Isaac Newton toward the endof the same century. Since that time, up until the middle of the twentieth century,the study and practice of ﬂuid dynamics, including aerodynamics, has dealt withpure experiment on one hand and pure theory on the other. If you were learningaerodynamics as recently as, say 1960, you would have been operating in the“two-approach world” of theory and experiment. However, computational ﬂuiddynamics has revolutionized the way we study and practice aerodynamics today.As sketched in Figure 2.46, CFD is today an equal partner with pure theory and pure experiment in the analysis and solution of aerodynamic problems. This is noﬂash in the pan—CFD will continue to play this role indeﬁnitely, for as long as ouradvanced human civilization exists. Also, the double arrows in Figure 2.46 implythat today each of the equal partners constantly interact with each other—theydo not stand alone, but rather help each other to continue to resolve and betterunderstand the “big picture” of aerodynamics. 2.18 SUMMARY Return to the road map for this chapter, as given in Figure 2.3. We have nowcovered both the left and right branches of this map and are ready to launch intothe solution of practical aerodynamic problems in subsequent chapters.

When ∇×V=0, the ﬂow is irrotational.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 199 Circulation /Gamma1is related to lift and is deﬁned as /Gamma1≡−/contintegraldisplay CV·ds (2.136) Circulation is also related to vorticity via /Gamma1≡−/contintegraldisplay CV·ds=−/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(∇ ×V)·dS (2.137) or (∇ ×V)·n=−d/Gamma1 dS(2.138) The stream function ¯ψis deﬁned such that ¯ψ(x,y)=constant is the equation of a streamline, and the difference in the stream function between two stream- lines/Delta1¯ψis equal to the mass ﬂow between the streamlines. As a consequence of this deﬁnition, in cartesian coordinates, ρu=∂¯ψ ∂y(2.147a) ρv=−∂¯ψ ∂x(2.147b) and in cylindrical coordinates, ρVr=1 r∂¯ψ ∂θ(2.148a) ρVθ=−∂¯ψ ∂r(2.148b) For incompressible ﬂow, ψ≡¯ψ/ρ is deﬁned such that ψ(x,y)=constant denotes a streamline and /Delta1ψ between two streamlines is equal to the vol- ume ﬂow between these streamlines. As a consequence of this deﬁnition, incartesian coordinates, u=∂ψ ∂y(2.150a) v=−∂ψ ∂x(2.150b) and in cylindrical coordinates, Vr=1 r∂ψ ∂θ(2.151a) Vθ=−∂ψ ∂r(2.151b) The stream function is valid for both rotational and irrotational ﬂows, but it isrestricted to two-dimensional ﬂows only.200 PART 1Fundamental Principles The velocity potential φis deﬁned for irrotational ﬂows only, such that V=∇φ (2.154) In cartesian coordinates, u=∂φ ∂xv=∂φ ∂yw=∂φ ∂z(2.156) In cylindrical coordinates, Vr=∂φ ∂rVθ=1 r∂φ ∂θVz=∂φ ∂z(2.157) In spherical coordinates, Vr=∂φ ∂rVθ=1 r∂φ ∂θV/Phi1=1 rsinθ∂φ ∂/Phi1(2.158) An irrotational ﬂow is called a potential ﬂow. A line of constant φis an equipotential line. Equipotential lines are perpen- dicular to streamlines (for two-dimensional irrotational ﬂows). 2.19 PROBLEMS 2.1Consider a body of arbitrary shape. If the pressure distribution over the surface of the body is constant, prove that the resultant pressure force onthe body is zero. [Recall that this fact was used in Equation (2.77).] 2.2Consider an airfoil in a wind tunnel (i.e., a wing that spans the entire testsection). Prove that the lift per unit span can be obtained from the pressuredistributions on the top and bottom walls of the wind tunnel (i.e., from thepressure distributions on the walls above and below the airfoil). 2.3Consider a velocity ﬁeld where the xandycomponents of velocity are given by u=cx/(x 2+y2)andv=cy/(x2+y2)where cis a constant. Obtain the equations of the streamlines. 2.4Consider a velocity ﬁeld where the xandycomponents of velocity are given by u=cy/(x2+y2)andv=−cx/(x2+y2), where cis a constant. Obtain the equations of the streamlines. 2.5Consider a velocity ﬁeld where the radial and tangential components ofvelocity are V r=0 and Vθ=cr, respectively, where cis a constant. Obtain the equations of the streamlines. 2.6Consider a velocity ﬁeld where the xandycomponents of velocity are given by u=cxandv=−cy, where cis a constant. Obtain the equations of the streamlines.CHAPTER 2Aerodynamics: Some Fundamental Principles and Equations 201 2.7The velocity ﬁeld given in Problem 2.3 is called source ﬂow, which will be discussed in Chapter 3. For source ﬂow, calculate: a. The time rate of change of the volume of a ﬂuid element per unit volume. b. The vorticity. Hint: It is simpler to convert the velocity components to polar coordinates and deal with a polar coordinate system. 2.8The velocity ﬁeld given in Problem 2.4 is called vortex ﬂow, which will be discussed in Chapter 3. For vortex ﬂow, calculate: a. The time rate of change of the volume of a ﬂuid element per unit volume. b. The vorticity.Hint: Again, for convenience use polar coordinates. 2.9Is the ﬂow ﬁeld given in Problem 2.5 irrotational? Prove your answer. 2.10 Consider a ﬂow ﬁeld in polar coordinates, where the stream function is given as ψ=ψ(r,θ). Starting with the concept of mass ﬂow between two streamlines, derive Equations (2.148 aandb). 2.11 Assuming the velocity ﬁeld given in Problem 2.6 pertains to anincompressible ﬂow, calculate the stream function and velocity potential.Using your results, show that lines of constant φare perpendicular to lines of constant ψ. 2.12 Consider a length of pipe bent into a U-shape. The inside diameter of the pipe is 0.5 m. Air enters one leg of the pipe at a mean velocity of 100 m/sand exits the other leg at the same magnitude of velocity, but moving inthe opposite direction. The pressure of the ﬂow at the inlet and exit is theambient pressure of the surroundings. Calculate the magnitude anddirection of the force exerted on the pipe by the airﬂow. The air densityis 1.23 kg/m 2.13 Consider the subsonic compressible ﬂow over the wavy wall treated inExample 2.1. Derive the equation for the velocity potential for this ﬂow asa function of xandy. 2.14 In Example 2.1, the statement is made that the streamline an inﬁnitedistance above the wall is straight. Prove this statement.PART2 Inviscid, Incompressible Flow In Part 2, we deal with the ﬂow of a ﬂuid that has constant density— incompressible ﬂow. This applies to the ﬂow of liquids, such as water ﬂow,and to low-speed ﬂow of gases. The material covered here is applicable to low-speed ﬂight through the atmosphere—ﬂight at a Mach number of about 0.3or less. 203CHAPTER 3 Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Theoretical ﬂuid dynamics, being a difﬁcult subject, is for convenience, commonly divided into two branches, one treating of frictionless or perfectﬂuids, the other treating of viscous or imperfect ﬂuids. The frictionless ﬂuid hasno existence in nature, but is hypothesized by mathematicians in order tofacilitate the investigation of important laws and principles that may beapproximately true of viscous or natural ﬂuids. Albert F. Zahm, 1912(Professor of aeronautics, anddeveloper of the ﬁrst aeronauticallaboratory in a U.S. university,The Catholic University of America) PREVIEW BOX Here we go again—fundamentals, and yet more fun- damentals. However, in this chapter we focus on thefundamentals of a speciﬁc class of ﬂow—inviscid,incompressible ﬂow. Actually, such ﬂow is a mython two accounts. First, in real life there is always fric-tion to some greater or lesser degree, so in nature thereis, strictly speaking, no inviscid ﬂow. Second, everyﬂow is compressible to some greater or lesser degree,so in nature there is, strictly speaking, no incompress-ible ﬂow. In engineering, however, if we were always“strictly speaking” about everything, we would notbe able to analyze anything. As you progress in yourstudies, you will ﬁnd that virtually every engineeringanalysis involves approximations about the physicsinvolved. In regard to the material in this chapter, there are a whole host of aerodynamic applications that are so close to being inviscid and incompressible that we readily make that assumption and obtain amazinglyaccurate results. Here you will ﬁnd out how low-speedwind tunnels work. You will discover how to mea-sure the velocity of a low-speed ﬂow using a basic 205206 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow instrument called a Pitot tube. Pitot tubes are in- stalled on virtually all airplanes to measure their ﬂight velocity—something as important and basic as havingthe speedometer in your automobile. You will discoverwhy a baseball curves when the pitcher puts spin onit, and why a golf ball will sometimes hook or slicewhen a golfer hits it. And there is a lot more. In the category of fundamentals, you will be introduced to Bernoulli’sequation, far and away the most famous equationin ﬂuid dynamics; it relates velocity and pressurefrom one point to another in an inviscid, incom-pressible ﬂow. You will learn how to calculate theﬂow over a circular body shape, and how to calcu-late and plot the precise streamline shapes for thisﬂow—something that is kind of fun to do, and thathas importance further down the line in our study ofaerodynamics. So this chapter is a mixture of fundamentals and applications. Add these fundamentals to yourgrowing inventory of basic concepts, and enjoy theapplications. 3.1 INTRODUCTION AND ROAD MAP The world of practical aviation was born on December 17, 1903, when, at 10:35 A.M., and in the face of cold, stiff, dangerous winds, Orville Wright piloted the Wright Flyer on its historic 12-s, 120-ft ﬁrst ﬂight. Figure 3.1 showsa photograph of the Wright Flyer at the instant of lift-off, with Wilbur Wrightrunning along the right side of the machine, supporting the wing tip so that itwill not drag the sand. This photograph is the most important picture in aviationhistory; the event it depicts launched the profession of aeronautical engineeringinto the mainstream of the twentieth century. 1 The ﬂight velocity of the Wright Flyer was about 30 mi/h. Over the ensuing decades, the ﬂight velocities of airplanes steadily increased. By means of morepowerful engines and attention to drag reduction, the ﬂight velocities of airplanesrose to approximately 300 mi/h just prior to World War II. Figure 3.2 shows a typ-ical ﬁghter airplane of the immediate pre-World War II era. From an aerodynamicpoint of view, at air velocities between 0 and 300 mi/h the air density remainsessentially constant, varying by only a few percent. Hence, the aerodynamics ofthe family of airplanes spanning the period between the two photographs shownin Figures 3.1 and 3.2 could be described by incompressible ﬂow. As a result, a huge bulk of experimental and theoretical aerodynamic results was acquiredover the 40-year period beginning with the Wright Flyer—results that applied toincompressible ﬂow. Today, we are still very interested in incompressible aero-dynamics because most modern general aviation aircraft still ﬂy at speeds below300 mi/h; a typical light general aviation airplane is shown in Figure 3.3. In addi-tion to low-speed aeronautical applications, the principles of incompressible ﬂowapply to the ﬂow of ﬂuids, for example, water ﬂow through pipes, the motion ofsubmarines and ships through the ocean, the design of wind turbines (the modernterm for windmills), and many other important applications. 1See Reference 2 for historical details leading to the ﬁrst ﬂight by the Wright brothers.CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 207 Figure 3.1 Historic photograph of the ﬁrst successful heavier-than-air powered manned ﬂight, achieved by the Wright brothers on December 17, 1903. (NASA). Figure 3.2 The Seversky P-35 (U.S. Air Force Photo). For all the above reasons, the study of incompressible ﬂow is as relevant today as it was at the time of the Wright brothers. Therefore, Chapters 3 to 6 deal exclusively with incompressible ﬂow. Moreover, for the most part, we ignore anyeffects of friction, thermal conduction, or diffusion; that is, we deal with inviscid incompressible ﬂow in these chapters. 2Looking at our spectrum of aerodynamic 2An inviscid, incompressible ﬂuid is sometimes called an ideal ﬂuid, orperfect ﬂuid. This terminology will not be used here because of the confusion it sometimes causes with “ideal gases” or “perfect gases” from thermodynamics. This author prefers to use the more precise descriptor “inviscid, incompressibleﬂow,” rather than ideal ﬂuid or perfect ﬂuid.208 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 3.3 Cessna 340 (© Getty Images/Digital Vision). Figure 3.4 Road map for Chapter 3.CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 209 ﬂows as shown in Figure 1.44, the material contained in Chapters 3 to 6 falls within the combined blocks DandE. The purpose of this chapter is to establish some fundamental relations ap- plicable to inviscid, incompressible ﬂows and to discuss some simple but impor-tant ﬂow ﬁelds and applications. The material in this chapter is then used as alaunching pad for the airfoil theory of Chapter 4 and the ﬁnite wing theory ofChapter 5. A road map for this chapter is given in Figure 3.4. There are three main avenues: (1) a development of Bernoulli’s equation, with some straightforwardapplications; (2) a discussion of Laplace’s equation, which is the governing equa-tion for inviscid, incompressible, irrotational ﬂow; and (3) the presentation ofsome elementary ﬂow patterns, how they can be superimposed to synthesize boththe nonlifting and lifting ﬂow over a circular cylinder, and how they form thebasis of a general numerical technique, called the panel technique, for the solu- tion of ﬂows over bodies of general shape. As you progress through this chapter,occasionally refer to this road map so that you can maintain your orientation andsee how the various sections are related. 3.2 BERNOULLI’S EQUATION As will be portrayed in Section 3.19, the early part of the eighteenth century sawthe ﬂowering of theoretical ﬂuid dynamics, paced by the work of Johann andDaniel Bernoulli and, in particular, by Leonhard Euler. It was at this time that therelation between pressure and velocity in an inviscid, incompressible ﬂow wasﬁrst understood. The resulting equation is p+ 1 2ρV2=const This equation is called Bernoulli’s equation, although it was ﬁrst presented in the above form by Euler (see Section 3.19). Bernoulli’s equation is probably the mostfamous equation in ﬂuid dynamics, and the purpose of this section is to derive itfrom the general equations discussed in Chapter 2. Consider the xcomponent of the momentum equation given by Equa- tion (2.113a). For an inviscid ﬂow with no body forces, this equation becomes ρDu Dt=−∂p ∂x or ρ∂u ∂t+ρu∂u ∂x+ρv∂u ∂y+ρw∂u ∂z=−∂p ∂x(3.1) For steady ﬂow, ∂u/∂t=0.Equation (3.1) is then written as u∂u ∂x+v∂u ∂y+w∂u ∂z=−1 ρ∂p ∂x(3.2)210 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Multiply Equation (3.2) by dx: u∂u ∂xdx+v∂u ∂ydx+w∂u ∂zdx=−1 ρ∂p ∂xdx (3.3) Consider the ﬂow along a streamline in three-dimensional space. The equation of a streamline is given by Equations (2.117a toc). In particular, substituting u dz−wdx=0 (2.117b) and vdx−udy=0 (2.117c) into Equation (3.3), we have u∂u ∂xdx+u∂u ∂ydy+u∂u ∂zdz=−1 ρ∂p ∂xdx (3.4) or u/parenleftbigg∂u ∂xdx+∂u ∂ydy+∂u ∂zdz/parenrightbigg =−1 ρ∂p ∂xdx (3.5) Recall from calculus that given a function u=u(x,y,z),the differential of uis du=∂u ∂xdx+∂u ∂ydy+∂u ∂zdz This is exactly the term in parentheses in Equation (3.5). Hence, Equation (3.5)is written as u du=−1 ρ∂p ∂xdx or1 2d(u2)=−1 ρ∂p ∂xdx (3.6) In a similar fashion, starting from the ycomponent of the momentum equation given by Equation (2.113b), specializing to an inviscid, steady ﬂow, and applyingthe result to ﬂow along a streamline, Equations (2.117a andc), we have 1 2d(v2)=−1 ρ∂p ∂ydy (3.7) Similarly, from the zcomponent of the momentum equation, Equation (2.113c), we obtain 1 2d(w2)=−1 ρ∂p ∂zdz (3.8) Adding Equations (3.6) through (3.8) yields 1 2d(u2+v2+w2)=−1 ρ/parenleftbigg∂p ∂xdx+∂p ∂ydy+∂p ∂zdz/parenrightbigg (3.9)CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 211 However, u2+v2+w2=V2(3.10) and∂p ∂xdx+∂p ∂ydy+∂p ∂zdz=dp (3.11) Substituting Equations (3.10) and (3.11) into Equation (3.9), we have 1 2d(V2)=−dp ρ or dp=−ρV dV (3.12) Equation (3.12) is called Euler’s equation. It applies to an inviscid ﬂow with no body forces, and it relates the change in velocity along a streamline dVto the change in pressure dpalong the same streamline. Equation (3.12) takes on a very special and important form for incompressible ﬂow. In such a case, ρ=constant, and Equation (3.12) can be easily integrated between any two points 1 and 2 along a streamline. From Equation (3.12), with ρ=constant, we have /integraldisplayp2 p1dp=−ρ/integraldisplayV2 V1V dV orp2−p1=−ρ/parenleftbiggV2 2 2−V2 1 2/parenrightbigg orp1+1 2ρV2 1=p2+1 2ρV2 2 (3.13) Equation (3.13) is Bernoulli’s equation, which relates p1andV1at point 1 on a streamline to p2andV2at another point 2 on the same streamline. Equation (3.13) can also be written as p+1 2ρV2=const along a streamline (3.14) In the derivation of Equations (3.13) and (3.14), no stipulation has been made as to whether the ﬂow is rotational or irrotational—these equations hold along astreamline in either case. For a general, rotational ﬂow, the value of the constantin Equation (3.14) will change from one streamline to the next. However, if theﬂow is irrotational, then Bernoulli’s equation holds between anytwo points in the ﬂow, not necessarily just on the same streamline. For an irrotational ﬂow, theconstant in Equation (3.14) is the same for all streamlines, and p+1 2ρV2=const throughout the ﬂow (3.15) The proof of this statement is given as Problem 3.1.212 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow The physical signiﬁcance of Bernoulli’s equation is obvious from Equa- tions (3.13) to (3.15); namely, when the velocity increases, the pressure decreases, and when the velocity decreases, the pressure increases. Note that Bernoulli’s equation was derived from the momentum equation; hence, it is a statement of Newton’s second law for an inviscid, incompressible ﬂow with no body forces. However, note that the dimensions of Equations (3.13)to (3.15) are energy per unit volume ( 1 2ρV2is the kinetic energy per unit vol- ume). Hence, Bernoulli’s equation is also a relation for mechanical energy in anincompressible ﬂow; it states that the work done on a ﬂuid by pressure forces isequal to the change in kinetic energy of the ﬂow. Indeed, Bernoulli’s equationcan be derived from the general energy equation, such as Equation (2.114). Thisderivation is left to the reader. The fact that Bernoulli’s equation can be interpretedas either Newton’s second law or an energy equation simply illustrates that theenergy equation is redundant for the analysis of inviscid, incompressible ﬂow.For such ﬂows, the continuity and momentum equations sufﬁce. (You may wishto review the opening comments of Section 2.7 on this same subject.) The strategy for solving most problems in inviscid, incompressible ﬂow is as follows: 1.Obtain the velocity ﬁeld from the governing equations. These equations, appropriate for an inviscid, incompressible ﬂow, are discussed in detail inSections 3.6 and 3.7. 2.Once the velocity ﬁeld is known, obtain the corresponding pressure ﬁeldfrom Bernoulli’s equation. However, before treating the general approach to the solution of such ﬂows(Section 3.7), several applications of the continuity equation and Bernoulli’sequation are made to ﬂows in ducts (Section 3.3) and to the measurement ofairspeed using a Pitot tube (Section 3.4). EXAMPLE 3.1 Consider an airfoil in a ﬂow at standard sea level conditions with a freestream velocity of 50 m/s. At a given point on the airfoil, the pressure is 0.9 ×105N/m2. Calculate the velocity at this point. ■Solution At standard sea level conditions, ρ∞=1.23 kg/m3andp∞=1.01×105N/m2. Hence, p∞+1 2ρV2 ∞=p+1 2ρV2 V=/radicalbigg 2(p∞−p) ρ+V2 ∞=/radicalbigg 2(1.01 −0.9)×105 1.23+(50)2 V=142.8 m/sCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 213 EXAMPLE 3.2 Consider the inviscid, incompressible ﬂow of air along a streamline. The air density along the streamline is 0.002377 slug/ft3, which is standard atmospheric density at sea level. At point 1 on the streamline, the pressure and velocity are 2116 lb/ft2and 10 ft/s, respectively. Further downstream, at point 2 on the streamline, the velocity is 190 ft/s. Calculate thepressure at point 2. What can you say about the relative change in pressure from point 1to point 2 compared to the corresponding change in velocity? ■Solution From Equation (3.13), p1+1 2ρV2 1=p2+1 2ρV2 2 Hence, p2=p1+1 2ρ/parenleftbig V2 1−V2 2/parenrightbig p2=2116+1 2(0.002377)[(10)2−(190)2] =2116+1 2(0.002377)(100 −36,100) =2116−42.8=2073.2 lb/ft2 Note: As the ﬂow velocity increases from 10 ft/s to 190 ft/s along the streamline, the pressure decreases from 2116 lb/ft2to 2073.1 lb/ft2. This is a factor of 19 increase in velocity, for only a factor of 42.8/2116, or 0.02 decrease in pressure. Stated another way,only a 2 percent decrease in the pressure creates a 1900 percent increase in the ﬂowvelocity. This is an example of a general characteristic of low-speed ﬂows—only a smallchange in pressure is required to obtain a large change in velocity. You can sense this inthe weather around you. Only a small barometric change from one location to another cancreate a strong wind. 3.3 INCOMPRESSIBLE FLOW IN A DUCT: THE VENTURI AND LOW-SPEED WIND TUNNEL Consider the ﬂow through a duct, such as that sketched in Figure 3.5. In general, the duct will be a three-dimensional shape, such as a tube with elliptical or rectangularcross sections which vary in area from one location to another. The ﬂow throughsuch a duct is three-dimensional and, strictly speaking, should be analyzed bymeans of the full three-dimensional conservation equations derived in Chapter 2.However, in many applications, the variation of area A=A(x)is moderate, and for such cases it is reasonable to assume that the ﬂow-ﬁeld properties are uniform across any cross section, and hence vary only in the xdirection. In Figure 3.5, uniform ﬂow is sketched at station 1, and another but different uniform ﬂow isshown at station 2. Such ﬂow, where the area changes as a function of xand all214 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow A = A (x)12 xV1 A1/H92671V2 A2/H92672 Figure 3.5 Quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow in a duct. the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables are assumed to be functions of xonly, that is, A=A(x), V=V(x),p=p(x),etc., is called quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow. Although such ﬂow is only an approximation of the truly three-dimensional ﬂow in ducts, the results are sufﬁciently accurate for many aerodynamic applications. Such quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow calculations are frequently used in engineering. They arethe subject of this section. Consider the integral form of the continuity equation written below: ∂ ∂t......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay VρdV+................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SρV·dS=0 (2.48) For steady ﬂow, this becomes ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SpV·dS=0 (3.16) Apply Equation (3.16) to the duct shown in Figure 3.5, where the control volume is bounded by A1on the left, A2on the right, and the upper and lower walls of the duct. Hence, Equation (3.16) is /integraldisplay/integraldisplay A1ρV·dS+/integraldisplay/integraldisplay A2ρV·dS+/integraldisplay/integraldisplay wallρV·dS=0 (3.17) Along the walls, the ﬂow velocity is tangent to the wall. Since by deﬁnition dSis perpendicular to the wall, then along the wall, V·dS=0,and the integral over the wall surface is zero; that is, in Equation (3.17), /integraldisplay/integraldisplay wallρV·dS=0 (3.18) At station 1, the ﬂow is uniform across A1.Noting that dSandVare in opposite directions at station 1 (dS always points outof the control volume by deﬁnition),CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 215 Convergent duct Divergent ductV1 p1/H11022 /H11021V1 p1V1 p1V2/H11021V1 V2 p2 /H92672/H11021p1 p2 Figure 3.6 Incompressible ﬂow in a duct. we have in Equation (3.17) /integraldisplay/integraldisplay A1pV·dS=−ρ1A1V1 (3.19) At station 2, the ﬂow is uniform across A2,and since dSandVare in the same direction, we have, in Equation (3.17), /integraldisplay/integraldisplay A2ρV·dS=ρ2A2V2 (3.20) Substituting Equations (3.18) to (3.20) into (3.17), we obtain −ρ 1A1V1+ρ2A2V2+0=0 or ρ1A1V1=ρ2A2V2 (3.21) Equation (3.21) is the quasi-one-dimensional continuity equation; it applies to both compressible and incompressible ﬂow.3In physical terms, it states that the mass ﬂow through the duct is constant (i.e., what goes in must come out). CompareEquation (3.21) with Equation (2.43) for mass ﬂow. Consider incompressible ﬂow only, where ρ=constant. In Equation (3.21), ρ 1=ρ2,and we have A1V1=A2V2 (3.22) Equation (3.22) is the quasi-one-dimensional continuity equation for incompress-ible ﬂow. In physical terms, it states that the volume ﬂow (cubic feet per secondor cubic meters per second) through the duct is constant. From Equation (3.22),we see that if the area decreases along the ﬂow (convergent duct), the velocity in-creases; conversely, if the area increases (divergent duct), the velocity decreases.These variations are shown in Figure 3.6; they are fundamental consequences of 3For a simpler, more rudimentary derivation of Equation (3.21), see Chapter 4 of Reference 2. In the present discussion, we have established a more rigorous derivation of Equation (3.21), consistent with the general integral form of the continuity equation.216 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 3.7 Flow through a venturi. the incompressible continuity equation, and you should fully understand them. Moreover, from Bernoulli’s equation, Equation (3.15), we see that when the ve-locity increases in a convergent duct, the pressure decreases; conversely, whenthe velocity decreases in a divergent duct, the pressure increases. These pressurevariations are also shown in Figure 3.6. Consider the incompressible ﬂow through a convergent-divergent duct, shown in Figure 3.7. The ﬂow enters the duct with velocity V 1and pressure p1.The velocity increases in the convergent portion of the duct, reaching a maximumvalue V 2at the minimum area of the duct. This minimum area is called the throat. Also, in the convergent section, the pressure decreases, as sketched in Fig- ure 3.7. At the throat, the pressure reaches a minimum value p2. In the divergent section downstream of the throat, the velocity decreases and the pressure in-creases. The duct shown in Figure 3.7 is called a venturi; it is a device that ﬁnds many applications in engineering, and its use dates back more than a century. Itsprimary characteristic is that the pressure p 2is lower at the throat than the ambient pressure p1outside the venturi. This pressure difference p1−p2is used to ad- vantage in several applications. For example, in the carburetor of an automobileengine, there is a venturi through which the incoming air is mixed with fuel. Thefuel line opens into the venturi at the throat. Because p 2is less than the surround- ing ambient pressure p1,the pressure difference p1−p2helps to force the fuel into the airstream and mix it with the air downstream of the throat. In an application closer to aerodynamics, a venturi can be used to measure airspeeds. Consider a venturi with a given inlet-to-throat area ratio A1/A2,as shown in Figure 3.7. Assume that the venturi is inserted into an airstream thatCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 217 has an unknown velocity V1.We wish to use the venturi to measure this velocity. With regard to the venturi itself, the most direct quantity that can be measured is the pressure difference p1−p2.This can be accomplished by placing a small hole (a pressure tap) in the wall of the venturi at both the inlet and the throatand connecting the pressure leads (tubes) from these holes across a differentialpressure gage, or to both sides of a U-tube manometer (see Section 1.9). In such afashion, the pressure difference p 1−p2can be obtained directly. This measured pressure difference can be related to the unknown velocity V1as follows. From Bernoulli’s equation, Equation (3.13), we have V2 1=2 ρ(p2−p1)+V2 2 (3.23) From the continuity equation, Equation (3.22), we have V2=A1 A2V1 (3.24) Substituting Equation (3.24) into (3.23), we obtain V2 1=2 ρ(p2−p1)+/parenleftbiggA1 A2/parenrightbigg2 V2 1 (3.25) Solving Equation (3.25) for V1,we obtain V1=/radicalBigg 2(p1−p2) ρ[(A1/A2)2−1](3.26) Equation (3.26) is the desired result; it gives the inlet air velocity V1in terms of the measured pressure difference p1−p2and the known density ρand area ratio A1/A2.In this fashion, a venturi can be used to measure airspeeds. Indeed, historically the ﬁrst practical airspeed indicator on an airplane was a venturiused by the French Captain A. Eteve in January 1911, more than 7 years afterthe Wright brothers’ ﬁrst powered ﬂight. Today, the most common airspeed-measuring instrument is the Pitot tube (to be discussed in Section 3.4); however,the venturi is still found on some general aviation airplanes, including home-builtand simple experimental aircraft. Another application of incompressible ﬂow in a duct is the low-speed wind tunnel. The desire to build ground-based experimental facilities designed to pro-duce ﬂows of air in the laboratory which simulate actual ﬂight in the atmospheredates back to 1871, when Francis Wenham in England built and used the ﬁrst windtunnel in history. 4From that date to the mid-1930s, almost all wind tunnels were 4For a discussion on the history of wind tunnels, see Chapter 4 of Reference 2.218 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 3.8 (a) Open-circuit tunnel. (b) Closed-circuit tunnel. designed to produce airﬂows with velocities from 0 to 250 mi/h. Such low-speed wind tunnels are still much in use today, along with a complement of transonic,supersonic, and hypersonic tunnels. The principles developed in this section allowus to examine the basic aspects of low-speed wind tunnels, as follows. In essence, a low-speed wind tunnel is a large venturi where the airﬂow is driven by a fan connected to some type of motor drive. The wind-tunnel fan bladesare similar to airplane propellers and are designed to draw the airﬂow through thetunnel circuit. The wind tunnel may be open circuit, where the air is drawn in thefront directly from the atmosphere and exhausted out the back, again directly tothe atmosphere, as shown in Figure 3.8a; or the wind tunnel may be closed circuit,where the air from the exhaust is returned directly to the front of the tunnel viaa closed duct forming a loop, as shown in Figure 3.8b. In either case, the airﬂowwith pressure p 1enters the nozzle at a low velocity V1,where the area is A1. The nozzle converges to a smaller area A2at the test section, where the velocity has increased to V2and the pressure has decreased to p2.After ﬂowing over an aerodynamic model (which may be a model of a complete airplane or part of anCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 219 airplane such as a wing, tail, engine, or nacelle), the air passes into a diverging duct called a diffuser, where the area increases to A3,the velocity decreases to V3, and the pressure increases to p3.From the continuity equation, Equation (3.22), the test-section air velocity is V2=A1 A2V1 (3.27) In turn, the velocity at the exit of the diffuser is V3=A2 A3V2 (3.28) The pressure at various locations in the wind tunnel is related to the velocity byBernoulli’s equation: p 1+1 2ρV2 1=p2+1 2ρV2 2=p3+1 2ρV3 3 (3.29) The basic factor that controls the air velocity in the test section of a given low-speed wind tunnel is the pressure difference p1−p2.To see this more clearly, rewrite Equation (3.29) as V2 2=2 ρ(p1−p2)+V2 1 (3.30) From Equation (3.27), V1=(A2/A1)V2.Substituting into the right-hand side of Equation (3.30), we have V2 2=2 ρ(p1−p2)+/parenleftbiggA2 A1/parenrightbigg2 V2 2 (3.31) Solving Equation (3.31) for V2,we obtain V2=/radicalBigg 2(p1−p2) ρ[1−(A2/A1)2](3.32) The area ratio A2/A1is a ﬁxed quantity for a wind tunnel of given design. More- over, the density is a known constant for incompressible ﬂow. Therefore, Equa-tion (3.32) demonstrates conclusively that the test-section velocity V 2is governed by the pressure difference p1−p2.The fan driving the wind-tunnel ﬂow creates this pressure difference by doing work on the air. When the wind-tunnel operatorturns the “control knob” of the wind tunnel and adjusts the power to the fan, he orshe is essentially adjusting the pressure difference p 1−p2and, in turn, adjusting the velocity via Equation (3.32).220 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow In low-speed wind tunnels, a method of measuring the pressure difference p1−p2, hence of measuring V2via Equation (3.32), is by means of a manometer as discussed in Section 1.9. In Equation (1.56), the density is the density of the liquid in the manometer (not the density of the air in the tunnel). The product of density and the acceleration of gravity gin Equation (1.56) is the weight per unit volume of the manometer ﬂuid. Denote this weight per unit volume by w. Referring to Equation (1.56), if the side of the manometer associated with pa is connected to a pressure tap in the settling chamber of the wind tunnel, wherethe pressure is p 1,and if the other side of the manometer (associated with pb) is connected to a pressure tap in the test section, where the pressure is p2,then, from Equation (1.56), p1−p2=w/Delta1h where /Delta1his the difference in heights of the liquid between the two sides of the manometer. In turn, Equation (3.32) can be expressed as V2=/radicalBigg 2w/Delta1 h ρ[1−(A2/A1)2] The use of manometers is a straightforward mechanical means to measure pressures. They are time-honored devices that date back to their invention bythe Italian mathematician Evangelista Torricelli in 1643. The French engineerGustave Eiffel used manometers to measure pressures on the surface of wingmodels mounted in his wind tunnel in Paris in 1909, initiating the use of manome-ters in wind tunnel work throughout much of the twentieth century. Today, in mostwind tunnels manometers have been replaced by an array of electronic pressure-measuring instruments. We discuss manometers here because they are part of thetradition of aerodynamics, and they are a good example of an application in ﬂuidstatics. In many low-speed wind tunnels, the test section is vented to the surrounding atmosphere by means of slots in the wall; in others, the test section is not a duct atall, but rather, an open area between the nozzle exit and the diffuser inlet. In bothcases, the pressure in the surrounding atmosphere is impressed on the test-sectionﬂow; hence, p 2=1 atm. (In subsonic ﬂow, a jet that is dumped freely into the surrounding air takes on the same pressure as the surroundings; in contrast, asupersonic free jet may have completely different pressures than the surroundingatmosphere, as we see in Chapter 10.) Keep in mind that the basic equations used in this section have certain limitations—we are assuming a quasi-one-dimensional inviscid ﬂow. Such equa-tions can sometimes lead to misleading results when the neglected phenomenaare in reality important. For example, if A 3=A1(inlet area of the tunnel is equal to the exit area), then Equations (3.27) and (3.28) yield V3=V1.In turn, fromCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 221 (a) Figure 3.9 (a) Test section of a large subsonic wind tunnel; (NASA). Equation (3.29), p3=p1;that is, there is no pressure difference across the entire tunnel circuit. If this were true, the tunnel would run without the application of any power—we would have a perpetual motion machine. In reality, there arelosses in the airﬂow due to friction at the tunnel walls and drag on the aerody-namic model in the test section. Bernoulli’s equation, Equation (3.29), does nottake such losses into account. (Review the derivation of Bernoulli’s equation inSection 3.2; note that viscous effects are neglected.) Thus, in an actual wind tun-nel, there is a pressure loss due to viscous and drag effects, and p 3<p1. The function of the wind-tunnel motor and fan is to add power to the airﬂow in orderto increase the pressure of the ﬂow coming out of the diffuser so that it can beexhausted into the atmosphere (Figure 3.8a) or returned to the inlet of the nozzleat the higher pressure p 1(Figure 3.8b). Photographs of a typical subsonic wind tunnel are shown in Figure 3.9a andb.222 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow (b) Figure 3.9 (continued )(b) The power fan drive section. (NASA). EXAMPLE 3.3 Consider a venturi with a throat-to-inlet area ratio of 0.8 mounted in a ﬂow at standard sea level conditions.

Take the original mile/hour, and multiply it by an equivalent “unity.” Since 1609 m is the same distance as 1 mi, then the ratio (1609 m/1 mi) isessentially “unity,” and since1hi st h esame time as 3600 s, then the ratio(1 h/3600 s) is essentially “unity.” Multiplying (mi/h) by these two equivalent unityratios, the miles cancel, and the hours cancel, and we are left with the proper numberof meters per second.)

This reinforces thegeneral trend noted in Example 3.2, namely, that in a low-speed ﬂow, a smallpressure change results in a large velocity change.226 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow V1 Static pressure measured hereTotal pressuremeasured here V B = 0 Static pressure orificePitot tubePressure gage C p1D B ApB = p0 Figure 3.11 Pitot tube and a static pressure oriﬁce. 3.4 PITOT TUBE: MEASUREMENT OF AIRSPEED In 1732, the Frenchman Henri Pitot was busy trying to measure the ﬂow velocity of the Seine River in Paris. One of the instruments he used was his own invention—astrange-looking tube bent into an L shape, as shown in Figure 3.11. Pitot orientedone of the open ends of the tube so that it faced directly into the ﬂow. In turn, heused the pressure inside this tube to measure the water ﬂow velocity. This was theﬁrst time in history that a proper measurement of ﬂuid velocity was made, andPitot’s invention has carried through to the present day as the Pitot tube—one of the most common and frequently used instruments in any modern aerodynamiclaboratory. Moreover, a Pitot tube is the most common device for measuringﬂight velocities of airplanes. The purpose of this section is to describe the basicprinciple of the Pitot tube. 5 Consider a ﬂow with pressure p1moving with velocity V1,as sketched at the left of Figure 3.11. Let us consider the signiﬁcance of the pressure p1more closely. In Section 1.4, the pressure is associated with the time rate of changeof momentum of the gas molecules impacting on or crossing a surface; thatis, pressure is clearly related to the motion of the molecules. This motion isvery random, with molecules moving in all directions with various velocities.Now imagine that you hop on a ﬂuid element of the ﬂow and ride with it at thevelocity V The gas molecules, because of their random motion, will still bump 5See Chapter 4 of Reference 2 for a detailed discussion of the history of the Pitot tube, how Pitot used it to overturn a basic theory in civil engineering, how it created some controversy in engineering, and how it ﬁnally found application in aeronautics.CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 227 into you, and you will feel the pressure p1of the gas. We now give this pressure a speciﬁc name: the static pressure. Static pressure is a measure of the purely random motion of molecules in the gas; it is the pressure you feel when you ride along with the gas at the local ﬂow velocity. All pressures used in this book so farhave been static pressures; the pressure pappearing in all our previous equations has been the static pressure. In engineering, whenever a reference is made to“pressure” without further qualiﬁcation, that pressure is always interpreted as thestatic pressure. Furthermore, consider a boundary of the ﬂow, such as a wall, where a small hole is drilled perpendicular to the surface. The plane of the hole isparallel to the ﬂow, as shown at point Ain Figure 3.11. Because the ﬂow moves over the opening, the pressure felt at point Ais due only to the random motion of the molecules; that is, at point A, the static pressure is measured. Such a small hole in the surface is called a static pressure oriﬁce, or astatic pressure tap. In contrast, consider that a Pitot tube is now inserted into the ﬂow, with an open end facing directly into the ﬂow. That is, the plane of the opening of the tubeis perpendicular to the ﬂow, as shown at point Bin Figure 3.11. The other end of the Pitot tube is connected to a pressure gage, such as point Cin Figure 3.11 (i.e., the Pitot tube is closed at point C). For the ﬁrst few milliseconds after the Pitot tube is inserted into the ﬂow, the gas will rush into the open end and will ﬁll thetube. However, the tube is closed at point C; there is no place for the gas to go, and hence after a brief period of adjustment, the gas inside the tube will stagnate; thatis, the gas velocity inside the tube will go to zero. Indeed, the gas will eventuallypile up and stagnate everywhere inside the tube, including at the open mouth at point B. As a result, the streamline of the ﬂow that impinges directly at the open face of the tube (streamline DBin Figure 3.11) sees this face as an obstruction to the ﬂow. The ﬂuid elements along streamline DBslow down as they get closer to the Pitot tube and go to zero velocity right at point B. Any point in a ﬂow where V=0 is called a stagnation point of the ﬂow; hence, point Bat the open face of the Pitot tube is a stagnation point, where V B=0.In turn, from Bernoulli’s equation we know the pressure increases as the velocity decreases. Hence, pB>p1.The pressure at a stagnation point is called the stagnation pressure, or total pressure, denoted by p0. Hence, at point B,pB=p0. From the above discussion, we see that two types of pressure can be deﬁned for a given ﬂow: static pressure, which is the pressure you feel by moving withthe ﬂow at its local velocity V 1,and total pressure, which is the pressure that the ﬂow achieves when the velocity is reduced to zero. In aerodynamics, thedistinction between total and static pressure is important; we have discussed thisdistinction at some length, and you should make yourself comfortable with theabove paragraphs before proceeding further. (Further elaboration on the meaningand signiﬁcance of total and static pressure will be made in Chapter 7.) How is the Pitot tube used to measure ﬂow velocity? To answer this question, ﬁrst note that the total pressure p 0exerted by the ﬂow at the tube inlet (point B) is impressed throughout the tube (there is no ﬂow inside the tube; hence, the pressureeverywhere inside the tube is p 0). Therefore, the pressure gage at point Creads p0. This measurement, in conjunction with a measurement of the static pressure p1at point A,yields the difference between total and static pressure, p0−p1,228 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow V1Total pressure felt hereStatic pressurefelt here Figure 3.12 Pitot-static probe. and it is this pressure difference that allows the calculation of V1via Bernoulli’s equation. In particular, apply Bernoulli’s equation between point A, where the pressure and velocity are p1andV1,respectively, and point B, where the pressure and velocity are p0andV=0, respectively: pA+1 2ρV2 A=pB+1 2ρV2 B or p1+1 2ρV2 1=p0+0 (3.33) Solving Equation (3.33) for V1,we have V1=/radicalBigg 2(p0−p1) ρ(3.34) Equation (3.34) allows the calculation of velocity simply from the measured difference between total and static pressure. The total pressure p0is obtained from the Pitot tube, and the static pressure p1is obtained from a suitably placed static pressure tap. It is possible to combine the measurement of both total and static pressure in one instrument, a Pitot-static probe, as sketched in Figure 3.12. A Pitot-static probe measures p0at the nose of the probe and p1at a suitably placed static pressure tap on the probe surface downstream of the nose. In Equation (3.33), the term1 2ρV2 1is called the dynamic pressure and is denoted by the symbol q1. The grouping1 2ρV2is called the dynamic pressure by deﬁnition and is used in all ﬂows, incompressible to hypersonic: q≡1 2ρV2 However, for incompressible ﬂow, the dynamic pressure has special meaning;it is precisely the difference between total and static pressure. Repeating Equa-tion (3.33), we obtain p 1+1 2ρV2 1= p0 static dynamic total pressure pressure pressure or p1+q1=p0 or q1=p0−p1 (3.35)CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 229 It is important to keep in mind that Equation (3.35) comes from Bernoulli’s equa- tion, and thus holds for incompressible ﬂow only. For compressible ﬂow, where Bernoulli’s equation is not valid, the pressure difference p0−p1isnotequal to q1. Moreover, Equation (3.34) is valid for incompressible ﬂow only. The velocities ofcompressible ﬂows, both subsonic and supersonic, can be measured by means of aPitot tube, but the equations are different from Equation (3.34). (Velocity measure-ments in subsonic and supersonic compressible ﬂows are discussed in Chapter 8.) At this stage, it is important to repeat that Bernoulli’s equation holds for incompressible ﬂow only, and therefore any result derived from Bernoulli’s equa-tion also holds for incompressible ﬂow only, such as Equations (3.26), (3.32),and (3.34). Experience has shown that some students when ﬁrst introduced toaerodynamics seem to adopt Bernoulli’s equation as the gospel and tend to useit for all applications, including many cases where it is not valid. Hopefully, therepetitive warnings given above will squelch such tendencies. EXAMPLE 3.7 An airplane is ﬂying at standard sea level. The measurement obtained from a Pitot tube mounted on the wing tip reads 2190 lb/ft2. What is the velocity of the airplane? ■Solution Standard sea level pressure is 2116 lb/ft2. From Equation (3.34), we have V1=/radicalbigg 2(p0−p1) ρ=/radicalbigg 2(2190 −2116) 0.002377=250 ft/s EXAMPLE 3.8 In the wind-tunnel ﬂow described in Example 3.5, a small Pitot tube is mounted in theﬂow just upstream of the model. Calculate the pressure measured by the Pitot tube for thesame ﬂow conditions as in Example 3.5. ■Solution From Equation (3.35), p0=p∞+q∞=p∞+1 2ρ∞V2 ∞ =2116+1 2(0.002377)(328.4)2 =2116+128.2 =2244 lb/ft2 Note in this example that the dynamic pressure is1 2ρ∞V2 ∞=128.2 lb/ft2. This is less than 1 percent larger than the pressure difference (p1−p2),calculated in Example 3.5, that is required to produce the test-section velocity in the wind tunnel. Why is (p1−p2)so close to the test-section dynamic pressure? Answer: Because the velocity in the settling chamber V1is so small that p1is close to the total pressure of the ﬂow. Indeed, from Equation (3.22), V1=A2 A1V2=/parenleftbigg1 12/parenrightbigg (328.4) =27.3 ft/s230 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Compared to the test-section velocity of 328.4 ft/s, V1is seen to be small. In regions of a ﬂow where the velocity is ﬁnite but small, the local static pressure is close to the total pressure. (Indeed, in the limiting case of a ﬂuid with zero velocity,the local static pressure is the same as the total pressure; here, the concepts ofstatic pressure and total pressure are redundant. For example, consider the air inthe room around you. Assuming the air is motionless, and assuming standard sealevel conditions, the pressure is 2116 lb/ft 2, namely, 1 atm. Is this pressure a static pressure or a total pressure? Answer: It isboth. By the deﬁnition of total pressure given in the present section, when the local ﬂow velocity is itself zero, then thelocal static pressure and the local total pressure are exactly the same.) EXAMPLE 3.9 Consider the P-35 shown in Figure 3.2 cruising at a standard altitude of 4 km. The pressure sensed by the Pitot tube on its right wing (as seen in Figure 3.2) is 6.7 ×104N/m2.

The general deﬁnition of equivalent airspeed is as follows. Consider an airplane ﬂyingat some true airspeed at some altitude. Its equivalent airspeed at this condition is deﬁned as the velocity at which it would have to ﬂy at standard sea level toexperience the same dynamic pressure. In Example 3.10, we have the P-35 ﬂyingat an altitude of 4 km at a true airspeed of 114.2 m/s, and simultaneously at anequivalent airspeed of 93.2 m/s. DESIGN BOX The conﬁguration of the Pitot-static probe shown in Figure 3.12 is a schematic only. The design of an actualPitot-static probe is an example of careful engineer-ing, intended to provide as accurate an instrument aspossible. Let us examine some of the overall featuresof Pitot-static probe design. Above all, the probe should be a long, streamlined shape such that the surface pressure over a substantial Support stemStagnation pointTotal pressuremeasured hereStatic pressure taps arrayedradially around tube14d 20d 01.0 –1.0Region where staticpressure alongsurface of tube is very close to p /H11009 Cp = p – p/H11009 q/H11009 x(a) (b) Figure 3.13 (a) Pitot-static tube.

The head of the probe, the nose at whichthe total pressure is measured, is usually a smoothhemispherical shape in order to encourage smooth,streamlined ﬂow downstream of the nose. The di-ameter of the tube is denoted by d. A number of static pressure taps are arrayed radially around the232 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow V ap/H11009 pa < p/H11009 (a)V bp/H11009 pb > p/H11009 (b)V cp/H11009 pc = p/H11009 (c) Figure 3.14 Schematic of static pressure taps. (a) and (b) Poor design. (c) Proper design. circumference of the tube at a station that should be from 8d to 16d downstream of the nose, and at least 16dahead of the downstream support stem. The rea- son for this is shown in Figure 3.13b, which gives theaxial distribution of the pressure coefﬁcient along thesurface of the tube. From the deﬁnition of pressurecoefﬁcient given in Section 1.5, and from Bernoulli’sequation in the form of Equation (3.35), the pressurecoefﬁcient at a stagnation point for incompressibleﬂow is given by C p=p−p∞ q∞=p0−p∞ q∞=q∞ q∞=1.0 Hence, in Figure 3.13b theCpdistribution starts out at the value of 1.0 at the nose, and rapidly drops as theﬂow expands around the nose. The pressure decreasesbelow p ∞, yielding a minimum value of Cp≈−1.25 just downstream of the nose. Further downstream thepressure tries to recover and approaches a value nearlyequal to p ∞at some distance (typically about 8d ) from the nose. There follows a region where the staticpressure along the surface of the tube is very close to p ∞, illustrated by the region where Cp=0 in Fig- ure 3.13b. This is the region where the static pressuretaps should be located, because the surface pressuremeasured at these taps will be essentially equal to thefreestream static pressure p ∞. Further downstream, as the ﬂow approaches the support stem, the pressurestarts to increase above p ∞. This starts at a distance of about 16d ahead of the support stem. In Figure 3.13a, the static pressure taps are shown at a station 14ddownstream of the nose and 20d ahead of the support stem.The design of the static pressure taps themselves is critical. The surface around the taps should besmooth to insure that the pressure sensed inside thetap is indeed the surface pressure along the tube. Ex-amples of poor design as well as the proper designof the pressure taps are shown in Figure 3.14. In Fig-ure 3.14a, the surface has a burr on the upstream side;the local ﬂow will expand around this burr, causingthe pressure sensed at point ainside the tap to be less than p ∞. In Figure 3.14b, the surface has a burr on the downstream side; the local ﬂow will be slowed in thisregion, causing the pressure sensed at point binside the tap to be greater than p ∞. The correct design is shown in Figure 3.14c; here, the opening of the tap isexactly ﬂush with the surface, allowing the pressuresensed at point cinside the tap to be equal to p ∞. When a Pitot-static tube is used to measure the speed of an airplane, it should be located on the air-plane in a position where it is essentially immersed inthe freestream ﬂow, away from any major inﬂuence ofthe local ﬂow ﬁeld around the airplane itself. An ex-ample of this can be seen in Figure 3.2, where a Pitot-static probe can be seen mounted near the right wingtip of the P-35, extending into the freestream ahead ofthe wing. A similar wing-mounted probe is shown inthe planview (top view) of the North American F-86in Figure 3.15. Today, many modern airplanes have a Pitot tube mounted at some location on the fuselage, and themeasurement of p ∞is obtained independently from a properly placed static pressure tap somewhere elseon the fuselage. Figure 3.16 illustrates a fuselage-mounted Pitot tube in the nose region of the BoeingCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 233 Figure 3.15 Three views of the North American F-86H. Note the wing-mounted Pitot-static tube.234 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow STRATOLINER Pitot tube Figure 3.16 Nose-mounted Pitot tube on the Boeing Stratoliner.

When only a Pitot measurement is required, the probe can be muchshorter than a Pitot-static tube, as can be seen in Fig-ure 3.16. In this type of arrangement, the location ofthe static pressure tap on the surface of the fuselage iscritical; it must be located in a region where the sur-face pressure on the fuselage is equal to p ∞.W eh a v e a pretty good idea where to locate the static pressuretaps on a Pitot-static tube, as shown in Figure 3.13a.But the proper location on the fuselage of a given air-plane must be found experimentally, and it is differentfor different airplanes. However, the basic idea is illus-trated in Figure 3.17, which shows the measured pres-sure coefﬁcient distribution over a streamlined bodyat zero angle of attack. There are two axial stationswhere C p=0 (i.e., where the surface pressure on the body equals p∞). If this body were an airplane fuse- lage, the static pressure tap should be placed at one ofthese two locations. In practice, the forward location,near the nose, is usually chosen. Finally, we must be aware that none of these instruments, no matter where they are located, areperfectly accurate. In particular, misalignment of the0.20.2 0 –0.20.4 –0.40.4 0.6 0.8 x/l l d= 3Cp = p – p/H11009 q/H11009 d Figure 3.17 Experimentally measured pressure coefﬁcient distribution over a streamlined body with a ﬁneness ratio (length-to-diameter ratio) of 3.

Low-speed ﬂow.CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 235 probe with respect to the freestream direction causes an error which must be assessed for each particularcase. Fortunately, the measurement of the total pres-sure by means of a Pitot tube is relatively insensi-tive to misalignment. Pitot tubes with hemisphericalnoses, such as shown in Figure 3.13a, are insensitiveto the mean ﬂow direction up to a few degrees. Pitottubes with ﬂat faces, such as illustrated in Figure 3.12,are least sensitive. For these tubes, the total pressuremeasurement varies only 1 percent for misalignmentas large as 20 ◦. For more details on this matter, see Reference 61. 3.5 PRESSURE COEFFICIENT Pressure, by itself, is a dimensional quantity (e.g., pounds per square foot, newtons per square meter). However, in Sections 1.7 and 1.8, we established the usefulnessof certain dimensionless parameters such as M,Re,C L.It makes sense, therefore, that a dimensionless pressure would also ﬁnd use in aerodynamics. Such a quantityis the pressure coefﬁcient C p,ﬁrst introduced in Section 1.5 and deﬁned as Cp≡p−p∞ q∞(3.36) where q∞=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞ The deﬁnition given in Equation (3.36) is just that—a deﬁnition. It is used through-out aerodynamics, from incompressible to hypersonic ﬂow. In the aerodynamicliterature, it is very common to ﬁnd pressures given in terms of C prather than the pressure itself. Indeed, the pressure coefﬁcient is another similarity parameterthat can be added to the list started in Sections 1.7 and 1.8. Forincompressible ﬂow, C pcan be expressed in terms of velocity only. Con- sider the ﬂow over an aerodynamic body immersed in a freestream with pressure p∞and velocity V∞. Pick an arbitrary point in the ﬂow where the pressure and velocity are pandV, respectively. From Bernoulli’s equation, p∞+1 2ρV2 ∞=p+1 2ρV2 or p−p∞=1 2ρ/parenleftbigV2 ∞−V2/parenrightbig(3.37) Substituting Equation (3.37) into (3.36), we have Cp=p−p∞ q∞=1 2ρ/parenleftbigV2 ∞−V2/parenrightbig 1 2ρV2 ∞ orCp=1−/parenleftbiggV V∞/parenrightbigg2 (3.38) Equation (3.38) is a useful expression for the pressure coefﬁcient; however, notethat the form of Equation (3.38) holds for incompressible ﬂow only.236 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Note from Equation (3.38) that the pressure coefﬁcient at a stagnation point (where V=0) in an incompressible ﬂow is always equal to 1.0. This is the highest allowable value of Cpanywhere in the ﬂow ﬁeld. (For compressible ﬂows, Cp at a stagnation point is greater than 1.0, as shown in Chapter 14.) Also, keep in mind that in regions of the ﬂow where V>V∞orp<p∞,Cpwill be a negative value. Another interesting property of the pressure coefﬁcient can be seen by rear- ranging the deﬁnition given by Equation (3.36), as follows: p=p∞+q∞Cp Clearly, the value of Cptells us how much pdiffers from p∞in multiples of the dynamic pressure. That is, if Cp=1 (the value at a stagnation point in an incompressible ﬂow), then p=p∞+q∞, or the local pressure is “one times” the dynamic pressure above freestream static pressure. If Cp=− 3,then p= p∞−3q∞,or the local pressure is three times the dynamic pressure below freestream static pressure. EXAMPLE 3.11 Consider an airfoil in a ﬂow with a freestream velocity of 150 ft/s. The velocity at a given point on the airfoil is 225 ft/s. Calculate the pressure coefﬁcient at this point. ■Solution Cp=1−/parenleftbiggV V∞/parenrightbigg2 =1−/parenleftbigg225 150/parenrightbigg2 =−1.25 EXAMPLE 3.12 Consider the airplane model in Example 3.4. When it is at a high angle of attack, slightlyless than that when C Lbecomes a maximum, the peak (negative) pressure coefﬁcient which occurs at a certain point on the airfoil surface is −5.3. Assuming inviscid, incompressible ﬂow, calculate the velocity at this point when (a) V∞=80 ft/s and (b) V∞=300 ft/s. ■Solution Using Equation (3.38), we have a. V=/radicalbig V2∞(1−Cp)=/radicalbig (80)2[1−(−5.3)] =200.8 ft/s b. V=/radicalbig V2∞(1−Cp)=/radicalbig (300)2[1−(−5.3)] =753 ft/s The above example illustrates two aspects of such a ﬂow, as follows: 1.Consider a given point on the airfoil surface. The Cpisgiven at this point and, from the statement of the problem. Cpis obviously unchanged when the velocity is increased from 80 to 300 ft/s. Why? The answer underscores part of our discussion on dimensional analysis in Section 1.7, namely, CpCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 237 should depend only on the Mach number, Reynolds number, shape and orientation of the body, and location on the body. For the low-speed inviscidﬂow considered here, the Mach number and Reynolds number are not in thepicture. For this type of ﬂow, the variation of C pis a function only of location on the surface of the body, and the body shape and orientation.Hence, C pwillnotchange with V∞orρ∞as long as the ﬂow can be considered inviscid and incompressible. For such a ﬂow, once the Cp distribution over the body has been determined by some means, the same Cpdistribution will exist for all freestream values of V∞andρ∞. 2.In part (b) of Example 3.12, the velocity at the point where Cpis a peak (negative) value is a large value, namely, 753 ft/s. Is Equation (3.38) validfor this case? The answer is essentially no. Equation (3.38) assumes incompressible ﬂow. The speed of sound at standard sea level is 1117 ft/s;hence, the freestream Mach number is 300/1117 =0.269. A ﬂow where the local Mach number is less than 0.3 can be assumed to be essentiallyincompressible. Hence, the freestream Mach number satisﬁes this criterion.On the other hand, the ﬂow rapidly expands over the top surface of theairfoil and accelerates to a velocity of 753 ft/s at the point of minimumpressure (the point of peak negative C p). In the expansion, the speed of sound decreases. (We will ﬁnd out why in Part 3.) Hence, at the point of minimum pressure, the local Mach number is greater than753 1117=0.674. That is, the ﬂow has expanded to such a high local Mach number that it isno longer incompressible. Therefore, the answer given in part (b) ofExample 3.12 is not correct. (We will learn how to calculate the correctvalue in Part 3.) There is an interesting point to be made here. Just becausea model is being tested in a low-speed, subsonic wind tunnel, it does notmean that the assumption of incompressible ﬂow will hold for all aspects ofthe ﬂow ﬁeld. As we see here, in some regions of the ﬂow ﬁeld around abody, the ﬂow can achieve such high local Mach numbers that it must beconsidered as compressible. 3.6 CONDITION ON VELOCITY FOR INCOMPRESSIBLE FLOW Consulting our chapter road map in Figure 3.4, we have completed the left branchdealing with Bernoulli’s equation. We now begin a more general consideration ofincompressible ﬂow, given by the center branch in Figure 3.4. However, beforeintroducing Laplace’s equation, it is important to establish a basic condition onvelocity in an incompressible ﬂow, as follows. First, consider the physical deﬁnition of incompressible ﬂow, namely, ρ= constant. Since ρis the mass per unit volume and ρis constant, then a ﬂuid element of ﬁxed mass moving through an incompressible ﬂow ﬁeld must alsohave a ﬁxed, constant volume. Recall Equation (2.32), which shows that ∇·Vis physically the time rate of change of the volume of a moving ﬂuid element per238 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow unit volume. However, for an incompressible ﬂow, we have just stated that the volume of a ﬂuid element is constant [e.g., in Equation (2.32), D(δV)/Dt≡0]. Therefore, for an incompressible ﬂow, ∇·V=0 (3.39) The fact that the divergence of velocity is zero for an incompressible ﬂow can also be shown directly from the continuity equation, Equation (2.52): ∂ρ ∂t+∇ ·ρV=0 (2.52) For incompressible ﬂow, ρ=constant. Hence, ∂ρ/∂ t=0 and ∇·(ρV)= ρ∇·V.Equation (2.52) then becomes 0+ρ∇·V=0 or ∇·V=0 which is precisely Equation (3.39). 3.7 GOVERNING EQUATION FOR IRROTATIONAL, INCOMPRESSIBLE FLOW: LAPLACE’S EQUATION We have seen in Section 3.6 that the principle of mass conservation for an incom- pressible ﬂow can take the form of Equation (3.39): ∇·V=0 (3.39) In addition, for an irrotational ﬂow we have seen in Section 2.15 that a velocitypotential φcan be deﬁned such that [from Equation (2.154)] V=∇φ (2.154) Therefore, for a ﬂow that is both incompressible and irrotational, Equations (3.39) and (2.154) can be combined to yield ∇·(∇φ)=0 or ∇2φ=0 (3.40) Equation (3.40) is Laplace’s equation—one of the most famous and extensively studied equations in mathematical physics. Solutions of Laplace’s equation arecalled harmonic functions, for which there is a huge bulk of existing litera- ture. Therefore, it is most fortuitous that incompressible, irrotational ﬂow isdescribed by Laplace’s equation, for which numerous solutions exist and arewell understood.CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 239 For convenience, Laplace’s equation is written below in terms of the three common orthogonal coordinate systems employed in Section 2.2: Cartesian coordinates: φ=φ(x,y,z) ∇2φ=∂2φ ∂x2+∂2φ ∂y2+∂2φ ∂z2=0 (3.41) Cylindrical coordinates: φ=φ(r,θ,z) ∇2φ=1 r∂ ∂r/parenleftbigg r∂φ ∂r/parenrightbigg +1 r2∂2φ ∂θ2+∂2φ ∂z2=0 (3.42) Spherical coordinates: φ=φ(r,θ,/Phi1 ) ∇2φ=1 r2sinθ/bracketleftbigg∂ ∂r/parenleftbigg r2sinθ∂φ ∂r/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂θ/parenleftbigg sinθ∂φ ∂θ/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂/Phi1/parenleftbigg1 sinθ∂φ ∂/Phi1/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg =0 (3.43) Recall from Section 2.14 that, for a two-dimensional incompressible ﬂow, a stream function ψcan be deﬁned such that, from Equations (2.150 aandb), u=∂ψ ∂y(2.150a) v=−∂ψ ∂x(2.150b) The continuity equation, ∇·V=0,expressed in cartesian coordinates, is ∇·V=∂u ∂x+∂v ∂y=0 (3.44) Substituting Equations (2.150 aandb) into (3.44), we obtain ∂ ∂x/parenleftbigg∂ψ ∂y/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg −∂ψ ∂x/parenrightbigg =∂2ψ ∂x∂y−∂2ψ ∂y∂x=0 (3.45) Since mathematically ∂2ψ/∂x∂y=∂2ψ/∂y∂x,we see from Equation (3.45) thatψautomatically satisﬁes the continuity equation. Indeed, the very deﬁnition and use of ψis a statement of the conservation of mass, and therefore Equa- tions (2.150 aandb) can be used in place of the continuity equation itself. If, in addition, the incompressible ﬂow is irrotational, we have, from the irrotationality condition stated in Equation (2.131), ∂v ∂x−∂u ∂y=0 (2.131) Substituting Equations (2.150 aandb) into (2.131), we have ∂ ∂x/parenleftbigg −∂ψ ∂x/parenrightbigg −∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg∂ψ ∂y/parenrightbigg =0240 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow or∂2ψ ∂x2+∂2ψ ∂y2=0 (3.46) which is Laplace’s equation. Therefore, the stream function also satisﬁes Laplace’s equation, along with φ. From Equations (3.40) and (3.46), we make the following obvious and im- portant conclusions: 1.Any irrotational, incompressible ﬂow has a velocity potential and stream function (for two-dimensional ﬂow) that both satisfy Laplace’s equation. 2.Conversely, any solution of Laplace’s equation represents the velocitypotential or stream function (two-dimensional) for an irrotational,incompressible ﬂow. Note that Laplace’s equation is a second-order linear partial differential equa- tion. The fact that it is linear is particularly important, because the sum of any particular solutions of a linear differential equation is also a solution of the equa- tion. For example, if φ 1,φ2,φ3,...,φ nrepresent nseparate solutions of Equa- tion (3.40), then the sum φ=φ1+φ2+···+ φn is also a solution of Equation (3.40). Since irrotational, incompressible ﬂow isgoverned by Laplace’s equation and Laplace’s equation is linear, we concludethat a complicated ﬂow pattern for an irrotational, incompressible ﬂow can besynthesized by adding together a number of elementary ﬂows that are also ir-rotational and incompressible. Indeed, this establishes the grand strategy forthe remainder of our discussions on inviscid, incompressible ﬂow. We developﬂow-ﬁeld solutions for several different elementary ﬂows, which by themselvesmay not seem to be practical ﬂows in real life. However, we then proceed to add(i.e., superimpose) these elementary ﬂows in different ways such that the resultingﬂow ﬁelds do pertain to practical problems. Before proceeding further, consider the irrotational, incompressible ﬂow ﬁelds over different aerodynamic shapes, such as a sphere, cone, or airplanewing. Clearly, each ﬂow is going to be distinctly different; the streamlines andpressure distribution over a sphere are quite different from those over a cone.However, these different ﬂows are all governed by the same equation, namely,∇ 2φ=0.How, then, do we obtain different ﬂows for the different bodies? The answer is found in the boundary conditions. Although the governing equation for the different ﬂows is the same, the boundary conditions for the equation mustconform to the different geometric shapes, and hence yield different ﬂow-ﬁeldsolutions. Boundary conditions are therefore of vital concern in aerodynamicanalysis. Let us examine the nature of boundary conditions further. Consider the external aerodynamic ﬂow over a stationary body, such as the airfoil sketched in Figure 3.18. The ﬂow is bounded by (1) the freestream ﬂowCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 241 yb = f(x) V/H11009nV sV/H11009 /H11009 /H11009/H11009/H11009V/H11009 V/H11009y x /H9274 = const Figure 3.18 Boundary conditions at inﬁnity and on a body; inviscid ﬂow. that occurs (theoretically) an inﬁnite distance away from the body and (2) the surface of the body itself. Therefore, two sets of boundary conditions apply asfollows. 3.7.1 Inﬁnity Boundary Conditions Far away from the body (toward inﬁnity), in all directions, the ﬂow approachesthe uniform freestream conditions. Let V ∞be aligned with the xdirection as shown in Figure 3.18. Hence, at inﬁnity, u=∂φ ∂x=∂ψ ∂y=V∞ (3.47a) v=∂φ ∂y=∂ψ ∂x=0 (3.47b) Equations (3.47a andb) are the boundary conditions on velocity at inﬁnity. They apply at an inﬁnite distance from the body in all directions, above and below, andto the left and right of the body, as indicated in Figure 3.18. 3.7.2 Wall Boundary Conditions If the body in Figure 3.18 has a solid surface, then it is impossible for the ﬂowto penetrate the surface. Instead, if the ﬂow is viscous, the inﬂuence of frictionbetween the ﬂuid and the solid surface creates a zero velocity at the surface. Suchviscous ﬂows are discussed in Chapters 15 to 20. In contrast, for inviscid ﬂowsthe velocity at the surface can be ﬁnite, but because the ﬂow cannot penetrate thesurface, the velocity vector must be tangent to the surface. This “wall tangency” condition is illustrated in Figure 3.18, which shows Vtangent to the body surface. If the ﬂow is tangent to the surface, then the component of velocity normal to the surface must be zero. Let nbe a unit vector normal to the surface as shown in242 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 3.18. The wall boundary condition can be written as V·n=(∇φ)·n=0 (3.48a ) or∂φ ∂n=0 (3.48b ) Equation (3.48a orb) gives the boundary condition for velocity at the wall; it is expressed in terms of φ. If we are dealing with ψrather than φ, then the wall boundary condition is ∂ψ ∂s=0 (3.48c ) where sis the distance measured along the body surface, as shown in Figure 3.18. Note that the body contour is a streamline of the ﬂow, as also shown in Figure 3.18. Recall that ψ=constant is the equation of a streamline. Thus, if the shape of the body in Figure 3.18 is given by yb=f(x),then ψsurface=ψy=yb=const (3.48d ) is an alternative expression for the boundary condition given in Equation (3.48c). If we are dealing with neither φnorψ,but rather with the velocity components uandvthemselves, then the wall boundary condition is obtained from the equation of a streamline, Equation (2.118), evaluated at the body surface; that is, dyb dx=/parenleftbiggv u/parenrightbigg surface(3.48e ) Equation (3.48e) states simply that the body surface is a streamline of the ﬂow.The form given in Equation (3.48e) for the ﬂow tangency condition at the bodysurface is used for all inviscid ﬂows, incompressible to hypersonic, and does notdepend on the formulation of the problem in terms of φorψ(or¯ψ). 3.8 INTERIM SUMMARY Reﬂecting on our previous discussions, the general approach to the solution ofirrotational, incompressible ﬂows can be summarized as follows: 1.Solve Laplace’s equation for φ[Equation (3.40)] or ψ[Equation (3.46)] along with the proper boundary conditions [such as Equations (3.47) and (3.48)]. These solutions are usually in the form of a sum of elementarysolutions (to be discussed in the following sections). 2.Obtain the ﬂow velocity from V=∇φoru=∂ψ/∂ yandv=−∂ψ/∂ x. 3.Obtain the pressure from Bernoulli’s equation, p+ 1 2ρV2=p∞+1 2ρV2 ∞, where p∞andV∞are known freestream conditions. Since Vandpare the primary dependent variables for an incompressible ﬂow, steps 1 to 3 are all that we need to solve a given problem as long as the ﬂow isincompressible and irrotational.CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 243 3.9 UNIFORM FLOW: OUR FIRST ELEMENTARY FLOW In this section, we present the ﬁrst of a series of elementary incompressible ﬂows that later will be superimposed to synthesize more complex incompressible ﬂows.For the remainder of this chapter and in Chapter 4, we deal with two-dimensionalsteady ﬂows; three-dimensional steady ﬂows are treated in Chapters 5 and 6. Consider a uniform ﬂow with velocity V ∞oriented in the positive xdirection, as sketched in Figure 3.19. It is easily shown (see Problem 3.8) that a uniformﬂow is a physically possible incompressible ﬂow (i.e., it satisﬁes ∇·V=0)and that it is irrotational (i.e., it satisﬁes ∇×V=0).Hence, a velocity potential for uniform ﬂow can be obtained such that ∇φ=V.Examining Figure 3.19, and recalling Equation (2.156), we have ∂φ ∂x=u=V∞ (3.49a) and∂φ ∂y=v=0 (3.49b) Integrating Equation (3.49a) with respect to x, we have φ=V∞x+f(y) (3.50) where f(y)is a function of yonly. Integrating Equation (3.49b) with respect to y,we obtain φ=const+g(x) (3.51) where g(x)is a function of xonly. In Equations (3.50) and (3.51), φis the same function; hence, by comparing these equations, g(x)must be V∞x,and f(y) must be constant. Thus, φ=V∞x+const (3.52) Figure 3.19 Uniform ﬂow.244 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Note that in a practical aerodynamic problem, the actual value of φis not sig- niﬁcant; rather, φis always used to obtain the velocity by differentiation; that is, ∇φ=V.Since the derivative of a constant is zero, we can drop the constant from Equation (3.52) without any loss of rigor. Hence, Equation (3.52) can be written as φ=V∞x (3.53) Equation (3.53) is the velocity potential for a uniform ﬂow with velocity V∞ oriented in the positive xdirection. Note that the derivation of Equation (3.53) does not depend on the assumption of incompressibility; it applies to any uniformﬂow, compressible or incompressible. Consider the incompressible stream function ψ. From Figure 3.19 and Equa- tions (2.150a andb), we have ∂ψ ∂y=u=V∞ (3.54a) and∂ψ ∂x=−v=0 (3.54b) Integrating Equation (3.54a) with respect to yand Equation (3.54b) with respect tox, and comparing the results, we obtain ψ=V∞y (3.55) Equation (3.55) is the stream function for an incompressible uniform ﬂow orientedin the positive xdirection. From Section 2.14, the equation of a streamline is given by ψ=constant. Therefore, from Equation (3.55), the streamlines for the uniform ﬂow are givenbyψ=V ∞y=constant. Because V∞is itself constant, the streamlines are thus given mathematically as y=constant (i.e., as lines of constant y). This result is consistent with Figure 3.19, which shows the streamlines as horizontal lines (i.e.,as lines of constant y). Also, note from Equation (3.53) that the equipotential lines are lines of constant x, as shown by the dashed line in Figure 3.19. Consistent with our discussion in Section 2.16, note that the lines of ψ=constant and φ= constant are mutually perpendicular. Equations (3.53) and (3.55) can be expressed in terms of polar coordinates, where x=rcosθandy=rsinθ,as shown in Figure 3.19. Hence, φ=V∞rcosθ (3.56) and ψ=V∞rsinθ (3.57)CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 245 Consider the circulation in a uniform ﬂow. The deﬁnition of circulation is given by /Gamma1≡−/contintegraldisplay CV·ds (2.136) Let the closed curve Cin Equation (2.136) be the rectangle shown at the left of Figure 3.19; handlare the lengths of the vertical and horizontal sides, respec- tively, of the rectangle. Then /contintegraldisplay CV·ds=−V∞l−0(h)+V∞l+0(h)=0 or /Gamma1=0 (3.58) Equation (3.58) is true for any arbitrary closed curve in the uniform ﬂow. To show this, note that V∞is constant in both magnitude and direction, and hence /Gamma1=−/contintegraldisplay CV·ds=−V∞·/contintegraldisplay Cds=V∞·0=0 because the line integral of dsaround a closed curve is identically zero. Therefore, from Equation (3.58), we state that circulation around any closed curve in a uniform ﬂow is zero. The above result is consistent with Equation (2.137), which states that /Gamma1=−/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(∇ ×V)·dS (2.137) We stated earlier that a uniform ﬂow is irrotational; that is, ∇×V=0 everywhere. Hence, Equation (2.137) yields /Gamma1=0. Note that Equations (3.53) and (3.55) satisfy Laplace’s equation [see Equa- tion (3.41)], which can be easily proved by simple substitution. Therefore, uniformﬂow is a viable elementary ﬂow for use in building more complex ﬂows. 3.10 SOURCE FLOW: OUR SECOND ELEMENTARY FLOW Consider a two-dimensional, incompressible ﬂow where all the streamlines arestraight lines emanating from a central point O, as shown at the left of Figure 3.20. Moreover, let the velocity along each of the streamlines vary inversely with dis-tance from point O. Such a ﬂow is called a source ﬂow. Examining Figure 3.20, we see that the velocity components in the radial and tangential directions are V r andVθ, respectively, where Vθ=0. The coordinate system in Figure 3.20 is a cylindrical coordinate system, with the zaxis perpendicular to the page. (Note that polar coordinates are simply the cylindrical coordinates randθconﬁned to a single plane given by z=constant.) It is easily shown (see Problem 3.9) that (1) source ﬂow is a physically possible incompressible ﬂow, that is, ∇·V=0, at every point except the origin, where ∇·Vbecomes inﬁnite, and (2) source ﬂow isirrotational at every point.246 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow /H9278 = const Figure 3.20 Source and sink ﬂows. In a source ﬂow, the streamlines are directed away from the origin, as shown at the left of Figure 3.20. The opposite case is that of a sink ﬂow, where by deﬁnition the streamlines are directed toward the origin, as shown at the right of Figure 3.20. For sink ﬂow, the streamlines are still radial lines from a common origin, along which the ﬂow velocity varies inversely with distance from point O. Indeed, a sink ﬂow is simply a negative source ﬂow. The ﬂows in Figure 3.20 have an alternate, somewhat philosophical inter- pretation. Consider the origin, point O,a sadiscrete source or sink. Moreover, interpret the radial ﬂow surrounding the origin as simply being induced by the presence of the discrete source or sink at the origin (much like a magnetic ﬁeldis induced in the space surrounding a current-carrying wire). Recall that, for asource ﬂow, ∇·V=0 everywhere except at the origin, where it is inﬁnite. Thus, the origin is a singular point, and we can interpret this singular point as a discrete source or sink of a given strength, with a corresponding induced ﬂow ﬁeld aboutthe point. This interpretation is very convenient and is used frequently. Other typesof singularities, such as doublets and vortices, are introduced in subsequent sec-tions. Indeed, the irrotational, incompressible ﬂow ﬁeld about an arbitrary bodycan be visualized as a ﬂow induced by a proper distribution of such singularitiesover the surface of the body. This concept is fundamental to many theoreticalsolutions of incompressible ﬂow over airfoils and other aerodynamic shapes, andit is the very heart of modern numerical techniques for the solution of such ﬂows.You will obtain a greater appreciation for the concept of distributed singularitiesfor the solution of incompressible ﬂow in Chapters 4 through 6. At this stage,however, simply visualize a discrete source (or sink) as a singularity that inducesthe ﬂows shown in Figure 3.20. Let us look more closely at the velocity ﬁeld induced by a source or sink. By deﬁnition, the velocity is inversely proportional to the radial distance r. As stated earlier, this velocity variation is a physically possible ﬂow, because it yields∇·V=0. Moreover, it is the only such velocity variation for which the relationCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 247 y xr d/H9258 l zr r/H9258 /H9258Line sourcedSVr Figure 3.21 V olume ﬂow rate from a line source. ∇·V=0 is satisﬁed for the radial ﬂows shown in Figure 3.20. Hence, Vr=c r(3.59a) and Vθ=0 (3.59b) where cis constant. The value of the constant is related to the volume ﬂow from the source, as follows. In Figure 3.20, consider a depth of length lperpendicular to the page, that is, a length lalong the zaxis. This is sketched in three-dimensional perspective in Figure 3.21. In Figure 3.21, we can visualize an entire line of sources along the zaxis, of which the source Ois just part. Therefore, in a two- dimensional ﬂow, the discrete source, sketched in Figure 3.20, is simply a singlepoint on the line source shown in Figure 3.21. The two-dimensional ﬂow shownin Figure 3.20 is the same in any plane perpendicular to the zaxis, that is, for any plane given by z=constant. Consider the mass ﬂow across the surface of the cylinder of radius rand height las shown in Figure 3.21. The elemental mass ﬂow across the surface element dSshown in Figure 3.21 is ρV·dS=ρV r(rdθ)(l). Hence, noting that Vris the same value at any θlocation for the ﬁxed radius r, the total mass ﬂow across the surface of the cylinder is ˙m=/integraldisplay2π 0ρVr(rdθ)l=ρrlV r/integraldisplay2π 0dθ=2πrlρVr (3.60) Since ρis deﬁned as the mass per unit volume and ˙mis mass per second, then ˙m/ρis the volume ﬂow per second. Denote this rate of volume ﬂow by ˙v. Thus, from Equation (3.60), we have ˙v=˙m ρ=2πrlV r (3.61)248 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Moreover, the rate of volume ﬂow per unit length along the cylinder is ˙v/l. Denote this volume ﬂow rate per unit length (which is the same as per unit depth perpendicular to the page in Figure 3.20) as /Lambda1. Hence, from Equation 3.61, we obtain /Lambda1=˙v l=2πrVr or Vr=/Lambda1 2πr(3.62) Hence, comparing Equations (3.59a) and (3.62), we see that the constant in Equa-tion (3.59a) is c=/Lambda1/2π . In Equation (3.62), /Lambda1deﬁnes the source strength, it is physically the rate of volume ﬂow from the source, per unit depth perpendicularto the page of Figure 3.20. Typical units of /Lambda1are square meters per second or square feet per second. In Equation (3.62), a positive value of /Lambda1represents a source, whereas a negative value represents a sink. The velocity potential for a source can be obtained as follows. From Equa- tions (2.157), (3.59b), and (3.62), ∂φ ∂r=Vr=/Lambda1 2πr(3.63) and1 r∂φ ∂θ=Vθ=0 (3.64) Integrating Equation (3.63) with respect to r, we have φ=/Lambda1 2πlnr+f(θ) (3.65) Integrating Equation (3.64) with respect to θ, we have φ=const+f(r) (3.66) Comparing Equations (3.65) and (3.66), we see that f(r)=(/Lambda1/2π) lnrand f(θ)=constant. As explained in Section 3.9, the constant can be dropped without loss of rigor, and hence Equation (3.65) yields φ=/Lambda1 2πlnr (3.67) Equation (3.67) is the velocity potential for a two-dimensional source ﬂow. The stream function can be obtained as follows. From Equations (2.151a andb), (3.59b), and (3.62), 1 r∂ψ ∂θ=Vr=/Lambda1 2πr(3.68) and −∂ψ ∂r=Vθ=0 (3.69)CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 249 Integrating Equation (3.68) with respect to θ, we obtain ψ=/Lambda1 2πθ+f(r) (3.70) Integrating Equation (3.69) with respect to r, we have ψ=const+f(θ) (3.71) Comparing Equations (3.70) and (3.71) and dropping the constant, we obtain ψ=/Lambda1 2πθ (3.72) Equation (3.72) is the stream function for a two-dimensional source ﬂow. The equation of the streamlines can be obtained by setting Equation (3.72) equal to a constant: ψ=/Lambda1 2πθ=const (3.73) From Equation (3.73), we see that θ=constant, which, in polar coordinates, is the equation of a straight line from the origin. Hence, Equation (3.73) is con- sistent with the picture of the source ﬂow sketched in Figure 3.20. Moreover,Equation (3.67) gives an equipotential line as r=constant, that is, a circle with its center at the origin, as shown by the dashed line in Figure 3.20. Once again,we see that streamlines and equipotential lines are mutually perpendicular. To evaluate the circulation for source ﬂow, recall the ∇×V=0 everywhere. In turn, from Equation (2.137), /Gamma1=−/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(∇ ×V)·dS=0 for any closed curve Cchosen in the ﬂow ﬁeld. Hence, as in the case of uniform ﬂow discussed in Section 3.9, there is no circulation associated with the sourceﬂow. It is straightforward to show that Equations (3.67) and (3.72) satisfy Laplace’s equation, simply by substitution into ∇ 2φ=0 and∇2ψ=0 written in terms of cylindrical coordinates [see Equation (3.42)]. Therefore, source ﬂow is a viableelementary ﬂow for use in building more complex ﬂows. 3.11 COMBINATION OF A UNIFORM FLOW WITH A SOURCE AND SINK Consider a polar coordinate system with a source of strength /Lambda1located at the origin. Superimpose on this ﬂow a uniform stream with velocity V∞moving from left to right, as sketched in Figure 3.22. The stream function for the resulting ﬂowis the sum of Equations (3.57) and (3.72): ψ=V ∞rsinθ+/Lambda1 2πθ (3.74)250 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 3.22 Superposition of a uniform ﬂow and a source; ﬂow over a semi-inﬁnite body. Since both Equations (3.57) and (3.72) are solutions of Laplace’s equation, we know that Equation (3.74) also satisﬁes Laplace’s equation; that is, Equa-tion (3.74) describes a viable irrotational, incompressible ﬂow. The streamlinesof the combined ﬂow are obtained from Equation (3.74) as ψ=V ∞rsinθ+/Lambda1 2πθ=const (3.75) The resulting streamline shapes from Equation (3.75) are sketched at the right ofFigure 3.22. The source is located at point D. The velocity ﬁeld is obtained by differentiating Equation (3.75): V r=1 r∂ψ ∂θ=V∞cosθ+/Lambda1 2πr(3.76) and Vθ=−∂ψ ∂r=−V∞sinθ (3.77) Note from Section 3.10 that the radial velocity from a source is /Lambda1/2π r, and from Section 3.9 the component of the freestream velocity in the radial direction is V∞cosθ. Hence, Equation (3.76) is simply the direct sum of the two velocity ﬁelds—a result that is consistent with the linear nature of Laplace’s equation.Therefore, not only can we add the values of φorψto obtain more complex solutions, we can add their derivatives, that is, the velocities, as well. The stagnation points in the ﬂow can be obtained by setting Equations (3.76) and (3.77) equal to zero: V ∞cosθ+/Lambda1 2πr=0 (3.78) and V∞sinθ=0 (3.79) Solving for randθ, we ﬁnd that one stagnation point exists, located at (r,θ)= (/Lambda1/2π V∞,π), which is labeled as point Bin Figure 3.22. That is, the stagnation point is a distance (/Lambda1/2π V∞)directly upstream of the source. From this result, theCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 251 distance DBclearly grows smaller if V∞is increased and larger if /Lambda1is increased— trends that also make sense based on intuition. For example, looking at Figure 3.22, you would expect that as the source strength is increased, keeping V∞the same, the stagnation point Bwill be blown further upstream. Conversely, if V∞is increased, keeping the source strength the same, the stagnation point will be blown furtherdownstream. If the coordinates of the stagnation point at Bare substituted into Equa- tion (3.75), we obtain ψ=V ∞/Lambda1 2πV∞sinπ+/Lambda1 2ππ=const ψ=/Lambda1 2=const Hence, the streamline that goes through the stagnation point is described byψ=/Lambda1/2. This streamline is shown as curve ABC in Figure 3.22. Examining Figure 3.22, we now come to an important conclusion. Since we are dealing with inviscid ﬂow, where the velocity at the surface of a solid bodyis tangent to the body, then anystreamline of the combined ﬂow at the right of Figure 3.22 could be replaced by a solid surface of the same shape. In particular,consider the streamline ABC. Because it contains the stagnation point at B, the streamline ABC is adividing streamline; that is, it separates the ﬂuid coming from the freestream and the ﬂuid emanating from the source. All the ﬂuid outside ABC is from the freestream, and all the ﬂuid inside ABC is from the source. Therefore, as far as the freestream is concerned, the entire region inside ABC could be replaced with a solid body of the same shape, and the external ﬂow, that is, the ﬂow fromthe freestream, would not feel the difference. The streamline ψ=/Lambda1/2 extends downstream to inﬁnity, forming a semi-inﬁnite body. Therefore, we are led to thefollowing important interpretation. If we want to construct the ﬂow over a solidsemi-inﬁnite body described by the curve ABC as shown in Figure 3.22, then all we need to do is take a uniform stream with velocity V ∞and add to it a source of strength /Lambda1at point D. The resulting superposition will then represent the ﬂow over the prescribed solid semi-inﬁnite body of shape ABC . This illustrates the practicality of adding elementary ﬂows to obtain a more complex ﬂow over abody of interest. The superposition illustrated in Figure 3.22 results in the ﬂow over the semi- inﬁnite body ABC. This is a half-body that stretches to inﬁnity in the downstream direction (i.e., the body is not closed). However, if we take a sink of equal strengthas the source and add it to the ﬂow downstream of point D, then the resulting body shape will be closed. Let us examine this ﬂow in more detail. Consider a polar coordinate system with a source and sink placed a distance bto the left and right of the origin, respectively, as sketched in Figure 3.23. The strengths of the source and sink are /Lambda1and−/Lambda1, respectively (equal and opposite). In addition, superimpose a uniform stream with velocity V ∞, as shown in Figure 3.23. The stream function for the combined ﬂow at any point Pwith252 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 3.23 Superposition of a uniform ﬂow and a source-sink pair; ﬂow over a Rankine oval. coordinates (r,θ)is obtained from Equations (3.57) and (3.72): ψ=V∞rsinθ+/Lambda1 2πθ1−/Lambda1 2πθ2 or ψ=V∞rsinθ+/Lambda1 2π(θ1−θ2) (3.80) The velocity ﬁeld is obtained by differentiating Equation (3.80) according to Equations (2.151a andb). Note from the geometry of Figure 3.23 that θ1and θ2in Equation (3.80) are functions of r,θ, and b. In turn, by setting V=0, two stagnation points are found, namely, points AandBin Figure 3.23. These stagnation points are located such that (see Problem 3.13) OA=OB=/radicalBigg b2+/Lambda1b πV∞(3.81) The equation of the streamlines is given by Equation (3.80) as ψ=V∞rsinθ+/Lambda1 2π(θ1−θ2)=const (3.82) The equation of the speciﬁc streamline going through the stagnation points isobtained from Equation (3.82) by noting that θ=θ 1=θ2=πat point Aand θ=θ1=θ2=0 at point B. Hence, for the stagnation streamline, Equation (3.82) yields a value of zero for the constant. Thus, the stagnation streamline is givenbyψ=0, that is, V ∞rsinθ+/Lambda1 2π(θ1−θ2)=0 (3.83) the equation of an oval, as sketched in Figure 3.23. Equation (3.83) is also thedividing streamline; all the ﬂow from the source is consumed by the sink and iscontained entirely inside the oval, whereas the ﬂow outside the oval has originatedwith the uniform stream only. Therefore, in Figure 3.23, the region inside the ovalCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 253 can be replaced by a solid body with the shape given by ψ=0, and the region outside the oval can be interpreted as the inviscid, potential (irrotational), incom- pressible ﬂow over the solid body. This problem was ﬁrst solved in the nineteenthcentury by the famous Scottish engineer W. J. M. Rankine; hence, the shape givenby Equation (3.83) and sketched in Figure 3.23 is called a Rankine oval. 3.12 DOUBLET FLOW: OUR THIRD ELEMENTARY FLOW There is a special, degenerate case of a source-sink pair that leads to a singularitycalled a doublet. The doublet is frequently used in the theory of incompressible ﬂow; the purpose of this section is to describe its properties. Consider a source of strength /Lambda1and a sink of equal (but opposite) strength −/Lambda1 separated by a distance l, as shown in Figure 3.24a. At any point Pin the ﬂow, the stream function is ψ=/Lambda1 2π(θ1−θ2)=−/Lambda1 2π/Delta1θ (3.84) where /Delta1θ=θ2−θ1as seen from Figure 3.24a. Equation (3.84) is the stream function for a source-sink pair separated by the distance l. Now in Figure 3.24a, let the distance lapproach zero while the absolute magnitudes of the strengths of the source and sink increase in such a fashion thatthe product l/Lambda1remains constant. This limiting process is shown in Figure 3.24b. In the limit, as l→0 while l/Lambda1remains constant, we obtain a special ﬂow pattern deﬁned as a doublet. The strength of the doublet is denoted by κand is deﬁned asκ≡l/Lambda1. The stream function for a doublet is obtained from Equation (3.84) as follows: ψ= lim l→0 κ=l/Lambda1=const/parenleftbigg −/Lambda1 2πdθ/parenrightbigg (3.85) Figure 3.24 How a source-sink pair approaches a doublet in the limiting case.254 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow where in the limit /Delta1θ→dθ→0. (Note that the source strength /Lambda1approaches an inﬁnite value in the limit.) In Figure 3.24b, let randbdenote the distances to point Pfrom the source and sink, respectively. Draw a line from the sink perpendicular to r, and denote the length along this line by a. For an inﬁnitesimal dθ, the geometry of Figure 3.24b yields a=lsinθ b=r−lcosθ dθ=a b Hence, dθ=a b=lsinθ r−lcosθ(3.86) Substituting Equation (3.86) into (3.85), we have ψ=lim l→0 κ=const/parenleftbigg −/Lambda1 2πlsinθ r−lcosθ/parenrightbigg or ψ=lim l→0 κ=const/parenleftbigg −κ 2πsinθ r−lcosθ/parenrightbigg or ψ=−κ 2πsinθ r(3.87) Equation (3.87) is the stream function for a doublet. In a similar fashion, the velocity potential for a doublet is given by (see Problem 3.14) φ=κ 2πcosθ r(3.88) The streamlines of a doublet ﬂow are obtained from Equation (3.87): ψ=−κ 2πsinθ r=const=c or r=−κ 2πcsinθ (3.89) Equation (3.89) gives the equation for the streamlines in doublet ﬂow. Recall fromanalytic geometry that the following equation in polar coordinates r=dsinθ (3.90) is a circle with a diameter don the vertical axis and with the center located d/2 directly above the origin. Comparing Equations (3.89) and (3.90), we see that the streamlines for a doublet are a family of circles with diameter κ/2πc, as sketched in Figure 3.25. The different circles correspond to different valuesof the parameter c. Note that in Figure 3.24 we placed the source to the left of the sink; hence, in Figure 3.25 the direction of ﬂow is out of the origin toCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 255 Figure 3.25 Doublet ﬂow with strength κ. the left and back into the origin from the right. In Figure 3.24, we could just as well have placed the sink to the left of the source. In such a case, the signsin Equations (3.87) and (3.88) would be reversed, and the ﬂow in Figure 3.25would be in the opposite direction. Therefore, a doublet has associated with it asense of direction—the direction with which the ﬂow moves around the circularstreamlines. By convention, we designate the direction of the doublet by an arrowdrawn from the sink to the source, as shown in Figure 3.25. In Figure 3.25, thearrow points to the left, which is consistent with the form of Equations (3.87)and (3.88). If the arrow would point to the right, the sense of rotation would bereversed, Equation (3.87) would have a positive sign, and Equation (3.88) wouldhave a negative sign. Returning to Figure 3.24, note that in the limit as l→0, the source and sink fall on top of each other. However, they do not extinguish each other, because theabsolute magnitude of their strengths becomes inﬁnitely large in the limit, andwe have a singularity of strength (∞−∞ ); this is an indeterminate form that can have a ﬁnite value. As in the case of a source or sink, it is useful to interpret the doublet ﬂow shown in Figure 3.25 as being induced by a discrete doublet of strength κplaced at the origin. Therefore, a doublet is a singularity that induces about it the double-lobed circular ﬂow pattern shown in Figure 3.25. 3.13 NONLIFTING FLOW OVER A CIRCULAR CYLINDER Consulting our road map given in Figure 3.4, we see that we are well into the thirdcolumn, having already discussed uniform ﬂow, sources and sinks, and doublets.Along the way, we have seen how the ﬂow over a semi-inﬁnite body can besimulated by the combination of a uniform ﬂow with a source, and the ﬂow overan oval-shaped body can be constructed by superimposing a uniform ﬂow and asource-sink pair. In this section, we demonstrate that the combination of a uniformﬂow and a doublet produces the ﬂow over a circular cylinder. A circular cylinder256 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 3.26 Superposition of a uniform ﬂow and a doublet; nonlifting ﬂow over a circular cylinder. is one of the most basic geometric shapes available, and the study of the ﬂow around such a cylinder is a classic problem in aerodynamics. Consider the addition of a uniform ﬂow with velocity V∞and a doublet of strength κ, as shown in Figure 3.26. The direction of the doublet is upstream, facing into the uniform ﬂow. From Equations (3.57) and (3.87), the stream func-tion for the combined ﬂow is ψ=V ∞rsinθ−κ 2πsinθ r or ψ=V∞rsinθ/parenleftbigg 1−κ 2πV∞r2/parenrightbigg (3.91) LetR2≡κ/2πV∞. Then Equation (3.91) can be written as ψ=(V∞rsinθ)/parenleftbigg 1−R2 r2/parenrightbigg (3.92) Equation (3.92) is the stream function for a uniform ﬂow-doublet combination;it is also the stream function for the ﬂow over a circular cylinder of radius Ras shown in Figure 3.26 and as demonstrated below. The velocity ﬁeld is obtained by differentiating Equation (3.92), as follows: V r=1 r∂ψ ∂θ=1 r(V∞rcosθ)/parenleftbigg 1−R2 r2/parenrightbigg Vr=/parenleftbigg 1−R2 r2/parenrightbigg V∞cosθ (3.93)CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 257 Vθ=−∂ψ ∂r=−/bracketleftbigg (V∞rsinθ)2R2 r3+/parenleftbigg 1−R2 r2/parenrightbigg (V∞sinθ)/bracketrightbigg Vθ=−/parenleftbigg 1+R2 r2/parenrightbigg V∞sinθ (3.94) To locate the stagnation points, set Equations (3.93) and (3.94) equal to zero: /parenleftbigg 1−R2 r2/parenrightbigg V∞cosθ=0 (3.95) /parenleftbigg 1+R2 r2/parenrightbigg V∞sinθ=0 (3.96) Simultaneously solving Equations (3.95) and (3.96) for randθ, we ﬁnd that there are two stagnation points, located at (r,θ)=(R,0)and(R,π). These points are denoted as AandB, respectively, in Figure 3.26. The equation of the streamline that passes through the stagnation point Bis obtained by inserting the coordinates of Binto Equation (3.92). For r=Rand θ=π, Equation (3.92) yields ψ=0. Similarly, inserting the coordinates of point Ainto Equation (3.92), we also ﬁnd that ψ=0. Hence, the same streamline goes through both stagnation points. Moreover, the equation of this streamline, from Equation (3.92), is ψ=(V∞rsinθ)/parenleftbigg 1−R2 r2/parenrightbigg =0 (3.97) Note that Equation (3.97) is satisﬁed by r=Rfor all values of θ. However, recall that R2≡κ/2πV∞, which is a constant. Moreover, in polar coordinates, r=constant =Ris the equation of a circle of radius Rwith its center at the origin. Therefore, Equation (3.97) describes a circle with radius R, as shown in Figure 3.26. Moreover, Equation (3.97) is satisﬁed by θ=πandθ=0 for all values of r; hence, the entire horizontal axis through points AandB, extending inﬁnitely far upstream and downstream, is part of the stagnation streamline. Note that the ψ=0 streamline, since it goes through the stagnation points, is the dividing streamline. That is, all the ﬂow inside ψ=0 (inside the circle) comes from the doublet, and all the ﬂow outside ψ=0 (outside the circle) comes from the uniform ﬂow. Therefore, we can replace the ﬂow inside the circle bya solid body, and the external ﬂow will not know the difference. Consequently,the inviscid irrotational, incompressible ﬂow over a circular cylinder of radius R can be synthesized by adding a uniform ﬂow with velocity V ∞and a doublet of strength κ, where Ris related to V∞andκthrough R=/radicalbiggκ 2πV∞(3.98) Note from Equations (3.92) to (3.94) that the entire ﬂow ﬁeld is symmetrical about both the horizontal and vertical axes through the center of the cylinder, as258 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow clearly seen by the streamline pattern sketched in Figure 3.26. Hence, the pressure distribution is also symmetrical about both axes. As a result, the pressure distri-bution over the top of the cylinder is exactly balanced by the pressure distributionover the bottom of the cylinder (i.e., there is no net lift ). Similarly, the pressure distribution over the front of the cylinder is exactly balanced by the pressure dis-tribution over the back of the cylinder (i.e., there is no net drag). In real life, the result of zero lift is easy to accept, but the result of zero drag makes no sense. Weknow that any aerodynamic body immersed in a real ﬂow will experience a drag.This paradox between the theoretical result of zero drag, and the knowledge thatin real life the drag is ﬁnite, was encountered in the year 1744 by the FrenchmanJean Le Rond d’Alembert—and it has been known as d’Alembert’s paradox ever since. For d’Alembert and other ﬂuid dynamic researchers during the eighteenthand nineteenth centuries, this paradox was unexplained and perplexing. Of course,today we know that the drag is due to viscous effects which generate frictionalshear stress at the body surface and which cause the ﬂow to separate from the sur-face on the back of the body, thus creating a large wake downstream of the bodyand destroying the symmetry of the ﬂow about the vertical axis through thecylinder. These viscous effects are discussed in detail in Chapters 15 through 20.However, such viscous effects are not included in our present analysis of theinviscid ﬂow over the cylinder. As a result, the inviscid theory predicts that theﬂow closes smoothly and completely behind the body, as sketched in Figure 3.26.It predicts no wake, and no asymmetries, resulting in the theoretical result ofzero drag. Let us quantify the above discussion. The velocity distribution on the surface of the cylinder is given by Equations (3.93) and (3.94) with r=R, resulting in V r=0 (3.99) and Vθ=−2V∞sinθ (3.100) Note that at the surface of the cylinder, Vris geometrically normal to the surface; hence, Equation (3.99) is consistent with the physical boundary condition thatthe component of velocity normal to a stationary solid surface must be zero.Equation (3.100) gives the tangential velocity, which is the full magnitude ofvelocity on the surface of the cylinder, that is, V=V θ=− 2V∞sinθon the surface. The minus sign in Equation (3.100) is consistent with the sign conventionin polar coordinates that V θis positive in the direction of increasing θ, that is, in the counterclockwise direction as shown in Figure 3.27. However, in Figure 3.26,the surface velocity for 0 ≤θ≤πis obviously in the opposite direction of increasing θ; hence, the minus sign in Equation (3.100) is proper. For π≤ θ≤2π, the surface ﬂow is in the same direction as increasing θ, but sin θis itself negative; hence, once again the minus sign in Equation (3.100) is proper.Note from Equation (3.100) that the velocity at the surface reaches a maximumvalue of 2 V ∞at the top and the bottom of the cylinder (where θ=π/2 and 3π/2, respectively), as shown in Figure 3.28. Indeed, these are the points ofCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 259 Figure 3.27 Sign convention for Vθin polar coordinates. 2V/H110092V/H11009 V/H11009 /H9258R Figure 3.28 Maximum velocity in the ﬂow over a circular cylinder. maximum velocity for the entire ﬂow ﬁeld around the cylinder, as can be seen from Equations (3.93) and (3.94). The pressure coefﬁcient is given by Equation (3.38): Cp=1−/parenleftbiggV V∞/parenrightbigg2 (3.38) Combining Equations (3.100) and (3.38), we ﬁnd that the surface pressure coef-ﬁcient over a circular cylinder is Cp=1−4 sin2θ (3.101) Note that Cpvaries from 1.0 at the stagnation points to −3.0 at the points of max- imum velocity. The pressure coefﬁcient distribution over the surface is sketchedin Figure 3.29. The regions corresponding to the top and bottom halves of thecylinder are identiﬁed at the top of Figure 3.29. Clearly, the pressure distributionover the top half of the cylinder is equal to the pressure distribution over thebottom half, and hence the lift must be zero, as discussed earlier. Moreover, theregions corresponding to the front and rear halves of the cylinder are identiﬁedat the bottom of Figure 3.29. Clearly, the pressure distributions over the frontand rear halves are the same, and hence the drag is theoretically zero, as alsodiscussed previously. These results are conﬁrmed by Equations (1.15) and (1.16).Since c f=0 (we are dealing with an inviscid ﬂow), Equations (1.15) and (1.16)260 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 3.29 Pressure coefﬁcient distribution over the surface of a circular cylinder; theoretical results for inviscid, incompressible ﬂow. become, respectively, cn=1 c/integraldisplayc 0(Cp,l−Cp,u)dx (3.102) ca=1 c/integraldisplayTE LE(Cp,u−Cp,l)dy (3.103) For the circular cylinder, the chord cis the horizontal diameter. From Figure 3.29, Cp,l=Cp,ufor corresponding stations measured along the chord, and hence the integrands in Equations (3.102) and (3.103) are identically zero, yielding cn=ca=0. In turn, the lift and drag are zero, thus, again conﬁrming our previous conclusions. EXAMPLE 3.13 Consider the nonlifting ﬂow over a circular cylinder. Calculate the locations on the surface of the cylinder where the surface pressure equals the freestream pressure. ■Solution When p=p∞, then Cp=0. From Equation (3.101), Cp=0=1−4 sin2θ Hence, sinθ=±1 2 θ=30◦,150◦,210◦,330◦ These points, as well as the stagnation points and points of minimum pressure, are illus-trated in Figure 3.30. Note that at the stagnation point, where C p=1, the pressure isCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 261 Figure 3.30 Values of pressure at various locations on the surface of a circular cylinder; nonlifting case. p∞+q∞; the pressure decreases to p∞in the ﬁrst 30◦of expansion around the body, and the minimum pressure at the top and bottom of the cylinder, consistent with Cp=−3, is p∞−3q∞. EXAMPLE 3.14 In the nonlifting ﬂow over a circular cylinder, consider the inﬁnitesimally small ﬂuid elements moving along the surface of the cylinder. Calculate the angular locations overthe surface where the acceleration of the ﬂuid elements are a local maximum and minimum.For the case where the radius of the cylinder is 1 m and the freestream ﬂow velocity is50 m/s, calculate the values of the local maximum and minimum accelerations. ■Solution From Equation (3.100) the local velocity of the ﬂuid elements on the surface as a functionof angular location θis V θ=−2V∞sinθ (3.100) The acceleration of the ﬂuid elements is dVθ/dt. From Equation (3.100), dVθ dt=−2V∞(cosθ)dθ dt(E3.1) Return to Figure 3.28. Let dθbe an incremental change in θ. The corresponding incre- mental distance on the cylinder surface subtended by dθisds, given by ds=Rdθ262 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Hence, dθ dt=1 Rds dt(E3.2) Substituting Equation (E3.2) into (E3.1), we have dVθ dt=−2V∞(cosθ)/parenleftbigg1 Rds dt/parenrightbigg (E3.3) For a ﬂuid element moving over an incremental distance dsin time dt, its linear velocity is by deﬁnition ds/dt. Thus, Vθ≡ds/dt. Replacing ds/dtin Equation (E3.3) with Vθ, we have dVθ dt=−2V∞(cosθ)/parenleftbiggVθ R/parenrightbigg (E3.4) Substitute Equation (3.100) into (E3.4). dVθ dt=4V2 ∞ Rsinθcosθ (E3.5) From the trigonometric identity sin 2θ ≡2 sinθcosθ Equation (E3.5) becomes dVθ dt=2V2 ∞ Rsin 2θ (E3.6) Equation (E3.6) gives the ﬂow acceleration along the surface, dVθ/dt, as a function of angular location θalong the surface. To ﬁnd the θlocations at which the acceleration is a maximum or minimum, differentiate Equation (E3.6) with respect to θ, and set the result equal to zero. d dθ/parenleftbiggdVθ dt/parenrightbigg =4V2 ∞ Rcos 2θ =0 (E3.7) Solving Equation (E3.7) for θ, we have the location where acceleration is either a local maximum or minimum: θ=45◦,135◦,225◦,315◦(E3.8) From Equation (E3.6), the values of the local ﬂow acceleration at each one of these locations are respectively 2V2 ∞ R,−2V2 ∞ R,2V2 ∞ R,−2V2 ∞ R(E3.9) Interpretation: Return to Figures 3.27 and 3.28, and note our sign convention that θis zero at the rearward stagnation point and increases in the counterclockwise direction; thisCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 263 is the conventional polar coordinate system where θincreases in the counterclockwise direction, and we have followed this convention throughout the present chapter. That is, as θsweeps counterclockwise, θ=90◦is the top of the cylinder, θ=180◦is the location of the forward stagnation point, and θ=270◦is the bottom of the cylinder. The consistent sign convention for Vθ, as seen in Figure 3.27, is positive in the direction of increasing θ. The direction of V∞in Figure 3.28, however, is left to right. Hence the actual left-to-right ﬂow over the topof the cylinder has a negative velocity because it is running counter to the positive direction of Vθshown in Figure 3.27. The left-to-right ﬂow over the bottom of the cylinder, however, has a positive velocity because it is running in the positive directionofV θ. This is totally consistent with the result given for Vθin Equation (3.100). Vθ=−2V∞sinθ (3.100) Over the top of the cylinder, where θvaries from 0◦to 180◦, Equation (3.100) gives a negative value of Vθ, whereas over the bottom of the cylinder, where θvaries from 180◦ to 360◦, Equation (3.100) gives a positive value of Vθ. With this in mind, now consider the location and values of the local maximum and minimum acceleration as given by relations(E3.8) and (E3.9), respectively. At θ=45 ◦, the acceleration is a positive value; i.e., the time rate of change Vθis positive. However, at θ=45◦, the velocity is a negative value, and with a positive time rate of change, the velocity is becoming less negative; i.e., theabsolute value of V θis becoming smaller. The ﬂuid element at θ=45◦isslowing down. The point θ=45◦is therefore a point of maximum deceleration (minimum acceleration). In contrast, at θ=135◦the velocity is a negative value, but from (E3.9), the local acceleration is also negative. This means that at θ=135◦, with a negative time rate of change of velocity, the velocity itself is becoming more negative, and its absolute valueis increasing. At θ=135 ◦, the ﬂuid element is speeding up, andθ=135◦is a point of maximum acceleration. Over the bottom surface of the cylinder, Vθis positive. At θ=225◦(which is on the front face of the cylinder) the acceleration from (E3.9) is also positive; i.e., at θ=225◦ the ﬂuid element is speeding up and hence θ=225◦is a point of maximum acceleration. Atθ=315◦(which is on the back face of the cylinder) the acceleration from (E3.9) is negative; i.e., at θ=315◦the ﬂuid element is slowing down. Hence, θ=315◦is a point of maximum deceleration. In short, again examining Figure 3.28, the ﬂow over the front face of the cylinder starts out at zero velocity at the front stagnation point (θ =180◦), accelerates to a maximum velocity of 2 V∞at the top (θ =90◦) and bottom (θ =270◦) of the cylinder, with a maximum acceleration occurring at θ=135◦and 225◦. The ﬂow then decelerates over the back face of the cylinder, coming to zero velocity at the rear stagnation point ( θ=0), with maximum deceleration occurring at θ=45◦and 315◦. It is interesting, and it also makes intuitive sense, that the maximum acceleration and deceleration occur geometricallyat the points on the cylinder surface halfway between the stagnation points and the pointsof maximum velocity at the top and bottom. We might have guessed this right from thebeginning of this worked example. But frequently in physical science intuition can betrayus, and it is necessary to make an analysis as we have done here to ﬁnd the correctresult.264 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Note: The interpretation given above is rather long and protracted. It was carried out in order to identify which of the positive or negative values in (E3.9) corresponded to an acceleration or deceleration, and at all times we had to keep our mind focused onthe sign convention for the polar coordinate system shown in Figures 3.27 and 3.28.This polar coordinate system with θincreasing in the counterclockwise direction is standard mathematical convention, and we have chosen to use it throughout thischapter. Finally, let us calculate the actual value of maximum acceleration and deceleration forR=1 m and V ∞=50 m/s. From (E3.9), 2V2 ∞ R=2(50)2 (1)=5000 m/s2 Since the standard sea level value of the acceleration of gravity on earth is 9.8 ms/s2,a ﬂuid element ﬂowing over the surface of the circular cylinder in this example experiencesa mind-boggling maximum acceleration and deceleration of 5000 9.8=510.2 g So once again, as we saw with Example 2.3, a ﬂuid element in an otherwise seeminglybenign ﬂow ﬁeld can experience tremendously large accelerations. 3.14 VORTEX FLOW: OUR FOURTH ELEMENTARY FLOW Again, consulting our chapter road map in Figure 3.4, we have discussed three elementary ﬂows—uniform ﬂow, source ﬂow, and doublet ﬂow—and have super-imposed these elementary ﬂows to obtain the nonlifting ﬂow over several bodyshapes, such as ovals and circular cylinders. In this section, we introduce ourfourth, and last, elementary ﬂow: vortex ﬂow. In turn, in Sections 3.15 and 3.16,we see how the superposition of ﬂows involving such vortices leads to cases withﬁnite lift. Consider a ﬂow where all the streamlines are concentric circles about a given point, as sketched in Figure 3.31. Moreover, let the velocity along any givencircular streamline be constant, but let it vary from one streamline to anotherinversely with distance from the common center. Such a ﬂow is called a vortex ﬂow. Examine Figure 3.31; the velocity components in the radial and tangentialdirections are V randVθ, respectively, where Vr=0 and Vθ=constant/ r. It is easily shown (try it yourself) that (1) vortex ﬂow is a physically possibleincompressible ﬂow, that is, ∇·V=0 at every point, and (2) vortex ﬂow is irrotational, that is, ∇×V=0, at every point except the origin. From the deﬁnition of vortex ﬂow, we have V θ=const r=C r(3.104)CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 265 Figure 3.31 V ortex ﬂow. To evaluate the constant C, take the circulation around a given circular streamline of radius r: /Gamma1=−/contintegraldisplay CV·ds=−Vθ(2πr) or Vθ=−/Gamma1 2πr(3.105) Comparing Equations (3.104) and (3.105), we see that C=−/Gamma1 2π(3.106) Therefore, for vortex ﬂow, Equation (3.106) demonstrates that the circulation taken about all streamlines is the same value, namely, /Gamma1=−2πC. By convention, /Gamma1is called the strength of the vortex ﬂow, and Equation (3.105) gives the velocity ﬁeld for a vortex ﬂow of strength /Gamma1. Note from Equation (3.105) that Vθis negative when/Gamma1is positive; that is, a vortex of positive strength rotates in the clockwise direction. (This is a consequence of our sign convention on circulation deﬁned inSection 2.13, namely, positive circulation is clockwise.) We stated earlier that vortex ﬂow is irrotational except at the origin. What happens at r=0? What is the value of ∇×Vatr=0? To answer these questions, recall Equation (2.137) relating circulation to vorticity: /Gamma1=−/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(∇ ×V)·dS (2.137)266 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Combining Equations (3.106) and (2.137), we obtain 2πC=/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(∇ ×V)·dS (3.107) Since we are dealing with two-dimensional ﬂow, the ﬂow sketched in Figure 3.31 takes place in the plane of the paper. Hence, in Equation (3.107), both ∇×Vand dSare in the same direction, both perpendicular to the plane of the ﬂow. Thus, Equation (3.107) can be written as 2πC=/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(∇ ×V)·dS=/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S|∇×V|dS (3.108) In Equation (3.108), the surface integral is taken over the circular area insidethe streamline along which the circulation /Gamma1=− 2πCis evaluated. However, /Gamma1is the same for all the circulation streamlines. In particular, choose a circle as close to the origin as we wish (i.e., let r→0). The circulation will still remain /Gamma1=− 2πC. However, the area inside this small circle around the origin will become inﬁnitesimally small, and /integraldisplay/integraldisplay S|∇×V|dS→ |∇ ×V|dS (3.109) Combining Equations (3.108) and (3.109), in the limit as r→0, we have 2πC= |∇ ×V|dS or |∇×V|=2πC dS(3.110) However, as r→0,dS→0. Therefore, in the limit as r→0, from Equa- tion (3.110), we have |∇×V|→∞ Conclusion: V ortex ﬂow is irrotational everywhere except at the point r=0, where the vorticity is inﬁnite. Therefore, the origin, r=0, is a singular point in the ﬂow ﬁeld. We see that, along with sources, sinks, and doublets, the vortexﬂow contains a singularity. Hence, we can interpret the singularity itself, that is,point Oin Figure 3.31, to be a point vortex which induces about it the circular vortex ﬂow shown in Figure 3.31. The velocity potential for vortex ﬂow can be obtained as follows: ∂φ ∂r=Vr=0 (3.111a) 1 r∂φ ∂θ=Vθ=−/Gamma1 2πr(3.111b)CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 267 Integrating Equations (3.111 aandb), we ﬁnd φ=−/Gamma1 2πθ (3.112) Equation (3.112) is the velocity potential for vortex ﬂow. The stream function is determined in a similar manner: 1 r∂ψ ∂θ=Vr=0 (3.113a) −∂ψ ∂r=Vθ=−/Gamma1 2πr(3.113b) Integrating Equations (3.113 aandb), we have ψ=/Gamma1 2πlnr (3.114) Equation (3.114) is the stream function for vortex ﬂow. Note that since ψ= constant is the equation of the streamline, Equation (3.114) states that the stream- lines of vortex ﬂow are given by r=constant (i.e., the streamlines are circles). Thus, Equation (3.114) is consistent with our deﬁnition of vortex ﬂow. Also, notefrom Equation (3.112) that equipotential lines are given by θ=constant, that is, straight radial lines from the origin. Once again, we see that equipotential linesand streamlines are mutually perpendicular. At this stage, we summarize the pertinent results for our four elementary ﬂows in Table 3.1.

Imagine that you are standing at a location 20 feet from the center of the vortex, and you are feeling a 100 mi/h wind. Whatis the strength of the vortex? ■Solution From Equation (3.105), Vθ=−/Gamma1 2πr In this example, the direction of the 100 mi/h wind is not stipulated; for our purpose it isnot relevant. We are interested only in the magnitude of the strength of the vortex. Hence,recalling that 88 ft/s =60 mi/h, we have |/Gamma1|=2π rV θ=2π(20)(100)88 60=1.843 x104ft2/s Comment: Actual numbers for circulation are not something frequently quoted. Therefore, most aerodynamicists do not have a “feel” for the magnitude of /Gamma1in most applications. In contrast, we do have a feel for more common properties such as velocity; we have afeel for what a 100 mi/h wind is like, especially anybody who has ventured outside in atropical storm. The purpose of this example is to show us a number for /Gamma1; in this case it is over 18,000 in the English engineering units of feet and seconds. In most cases we reallydo not care what the value of /Gamma1is because it is immediately used to obtain more practical data, such as aerodynamic lift (as we will see in the next section). 3.15 LIFTING FLOW OVER A CYLINDER In Section 3.13, we superimposed a uniform ﬂow and a doublet to synthesize the ﬂow over a circular cylinder, as shown in Figure 3.26. In addition, we provedthat both the lift and drag were zero for such a ﬂow. However, the streamlinepattern shown at the right of Figure 3.26 is not the only ﬂow that is theoreticallypossible around a circular cylinder. It isthe only ﬂow that is consistent with zero lift. However, there are other possible ﬂow patterns around a circular cylinder—different ﬂow patterns that result in a nonzero lift on the cylinder. Such liftingﬂows are discussed in this section. Now you might be hesitant at this moment, perplexed by the question as to how a lift could possibly be exerted on a circular cylinder. Is not the bodyperfectly symmetric, and would not this geometry always result in a symmetricﬂow ﬁeld with a consequent zero lift, as we have already discussed? You might beso perplexed that you run down to the laboratory, place a stationary cylinder in alow-speed tunnel, and measure the lift. To your satisfaction, you measure no lift,and you walk away muttering that the subject of this section is ridiculous—thereCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 269 Nonlifting flow over a cylinderV ortex ofstrength /H9003Lifting flow overa cylinderV /H11009 ORR /H9258 /H11001/H11005 /H9003r /H9274 = 0 Figure 3.32 The synthesis of lifting ﬂow over a circular cylinder. is no lift on the cylinder. However, go back to the wind tunnel, and this time run a test with the cylinder spinning about its axis at relatively high revolutions per minute. This time you measure a ﬁnite lift. Also, by this time you might be thinking of other situations: spin on a baseball causes it to curve, and spin on agolfball causes it to hook or slice. Clearly, in real life there are nonsymmetricaerodynamic forces acting on these symmetric, spinning bodies. So, maybe thesubject matter of this section is not so ridiculous after all. Indeed, as you will soonappreciate, the concept of lifting ﬂow over a cylinder will start us on a journeywhich leads directly to the theory of the lift generated by airfoils, as discussed inChapter 4. Consider the ﬂow synthesized by the addition of the nonlifting ﬂow over a cylinder and a vortex of strength /Gamma1, as shown in Figure 3.32. The stream function for nonlifting ﬂow over a circular cylinder of radius Ris given by Equation (3.92): ψ 1=(V∞rsinθ)/parenleftbigg 1−R2 r2/parenrightbigg (3.92) The stream function for a vortex of strength /Gamma1is given by Equation (3.114). Recall that the stream function is determined within an arbitrary constant; hence,Equation (3.114) can be written as ψ 2=/Gamma1 2πlnr+const (3.115) Since the value of the constant is arbitrary, let Const =−/Gamma1 2πlnR (3.116) Combining Equations (3.115) and (3.116), we obtain ψ2=/Gamma1 2πlnr R(3.117)270 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Equation (3.117) is the stream function for a vortex of strength /Gamma1and is just as valid as Equation (3.114) obtained earlier; the only difference between these two equations is a constant of the value given by Equation (3.116). The resulting stream function for the ﬂow shown at the right of Figure 3.32 is ψ=ψ1+ψ2 or ψ=(V∞rsinθ)/parenleftbigg 1−R2 r2/parenrightbigg +/Gamma1 2πlnr R(3.118) From Equation (3.118), if r=R, then ψ=0 for all values of θ. Since ψ=constant is the equation of a streamline, r=Ris therefore a streamline of the ﬂow, but r=Ris the equation of a circle of radius R. Hence, Equation (3.118) is a valid stream function for the inviscid, incompressible ﬂow over a circularcylinder of radius R, as shown at the right of Figure 3.32. Indeed, our previous result given by Equation (3.92) is simply a special case of Equation (3.118)with/Gamma1=0. The resulting streamline pattern given by Equation (3.118) is sketched at the right of Figure 3.32. Note that the streamlines are no longer symmetrical aboutthe horizontal axis through point O, and you might suspect (correctly) that the cylinder will experience a resulting ﬁnite normal force. However, the streamlinesare symmetrical about the vertical axis through O, and as a result the drag will be zero, as we prove shortly. Note also that because a vortex of strength /Gamma1has been added to the ﬂow, the circulation about the cylinder is now ﬁnite and equal to /Gamma1. The velocity ﬁeld can be obtained by differentiating Equation (3.118). An equally direct method of obtaining the velocities is to add the velocity ﬁeld of avortex to the velocity ﬁeld of the nonlifting cylinder. (Recall that because of thelinearity of the ﬂow, the velocity components of the superimposed elementaryﬂows add directly.) Hence, from Equations (3.93) and (3.94) for nonlifting ﬂowover a cylinder of radius R, and Equations (3.111a andb) for vortex ﬂow, we have, for the lifting ﬂow over a cylinder of radius R, V r=/parenleftbigg 1−R2 r2/parenrightbigg V∞cosθ (3.119) Vθ=−/parenleftbigg 1+R2 r2/parenrightbigg V∞sinθ−/Gamma1 2πr(3.120) To locate the stagnation points in the ﬂow, set Vr=Vθ=0 in Equa- tions (3.119) and (3.120) and solve for the resulting coordinates (r,θ): Vr=/parenleftbigg 1−R2 r2/parenrightbigg V∞cosθ=0 (3.121) Vθ=−/parenleftbigg 1+R2 r2/parenrightbigg V∞sinθ−/Gamma1 2πr=0 (3.122)CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 271 Figure 3.33 Stagnation points for the lifting ﬂow over a circular cylinder. From Equation (3.121), r=R. Substituting this result into Equation (3.122) and solving for θ, we obtain θ=arcsin/parenleftbigg −/Gamma1 4πV∞R/parenrightbigg (3.123) Since /Gamma1is a positive number, from Equation (3.123) θmust be in the third and fourth quadrants. That is, there can be two stagnation points on the bottom half of the circular cylinder, as shown by points 1 and 2 in Figure 3.33a. These pointsare located at (R,θ), where θis given by Equation (3.123). However, this result is valid only when /Gamma1/4πV ∞R<1. If/Gamma1/4πV∞R>1, then Equation (3.123) has no meaning. If /Gamma1/4πV∞R=1, there is only one stagnation point on the surface of the cylinder, namely, point (R,−π/ 2)labeled as point 3 in Figure 3.33b. For the case of /Gamma1/4πV∞R>1, return to Equation (3.121). We saw earlier that it is satisﬁed by r=R; however, it is also satisﬁed by θ=π/2 or−π/ 2. Substituting θ=−π/2 into Equation (3.122), and solving for r, we have r=/Gamma1 4πV∞±/radicalBigg/parenleftbigg/Gamma1 4πV∞/parenrightbigg2 −R2 (3.124) Hence, for /Gamma1/4πV∞R>1, there are two stagnation points, one inside and the other outside the cylinder, and both on the vertical axis, as shown by points 4and 5 in Figure 3.33c. [How does one stagnation point fall inside the cylinder? Recall that r=R, orψ=0, is just one of the allowed streamlines of the ﬂow. There is a theoretical ﬂow inside the cylinder—ﬂow that is issuing from thedoublet at the origin superimposed with the vortex ﬂow for r<R. The circular streamline r=Ris the dividing streamline between this ﬂow and the ﬂow from the freestream. Therefore, as before, we can replace the dividing streamline by272 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow a solid body—our circular cylinder—and the external ﬂow will not know the difference. Hence, although one stagnation point falls inside the body (point 5), we are not realistically concerned about it. Instead, from the point of view of ﬂowover a solid cylinder of radius R, point 4 is the only meaningful stagnation point for the case /Gamma1/4πV ∞R>1.] The results shown in Figure 3.33 can be visualized as follows. Consider the inviscid, incompressible ﬂow of given freestream velocity V∞over a cylinder of given radius R. If there is no circulation (i.e., if /Gamma1=0), the ﬂow is given by the sketch at the right of Figure 3.26, with horizontally opposed stagnationpoints AandB. Now assume that a circulation is imposed on the ﬂow, such that /Gamma1< 4πV ∞R. The ﬂow sketched in Figure 3.33a will result; the two stagnation points will move to the lower surface of the cylinder as shown by points 1 and2. Assume that /Gamma1is further increased until /Gamma1=4πV ∞R. The ﬂow sketched in Figure 3.33b will result, with only one stagnation point at the bottom of the cylinder, as shown by point 3. When /Gamma1is increased still further such that /Gamma1> 4πV∞R, the ﬂow sketched in Figure 3.33c will result. The stagnation point will lift from the cylinder’s surface and will appear in the ﬂow directly below thecylinder, as shown by point 4. From the above discussion, /Gamma1is clearly a parameter that can be chosen freely. There is no single value of /Gamma1that “solves” the ﬂow over a circular cylinder; rather, the circulation can be any value. Therefore, for the incompressible ﬂow over acircular cylinder, there are an inﬁnite number of possible potential ﬂow solutions,corresponding to the inﬁnite choices for values of /Gamma1. This statement is not limited to ﬂow over circular cylinders, but rather, it is a general statement that holds forthe incompressible potential ﬂow over all smooth two-dimensional bodies. Wereturn to these ideas in subsequent sections. From the symmetry, or lack of it, in the ﬂows sketched in Figures 3.32 and 3.33, we intuitively concluded earlier that a ﬁnite normal force (lift) must existon the body but that the drag is zero; that is, d’Alembert’s paradox still prevails.Let us quantify these statements by calculating expressions for lift and drag, asfollows. The velocity on the surface of the cylinder is given by Equation (3.120) with r=R: V=V θ=−2V∞sinθ−/Gamma1 2πR(3.125) In turn, the pressure coefﬁcient is obtained by substituting Equation (3.125) intoEquation (3.38): C p=1−/parenleftbiggV V∞/parenrightbigg2 =1−/parenleftbigg −2 sin θ−/Gamma1 2πRV∞/parenrightbigg2 or Cp=1−/bracketleftBigg 4 sin2θ+2/Gamma1sinθ πRV∞+/parenleftbigg/Gamma1 2πRV∞/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg (3.126)CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 273 In Section 1.5, we discussed in detail how the aerodynamic force coefﬁcients can be obtained by integrating the pressure coefﬁcient and skin friction coefﬁcientover the surface. For inviscid ﬂow, c f=0. Hence, the drag coefﬁcient cdis given by Equation (1.16) as cd=ca=1 c/integraldisplayTE LE(Cp,u−Cp,l)dy orcd=1 c/integraldisplayTE LECp,udy−1 c/integraldisplayTE LECp,ldy (3.127) Converting Equation (3.127) to polar coordinates, we note that y=Rsinθ dy=Rcosθdθ (3.128) Substituting Equation (3.128) into (3.127), and noting that c=2R, we have cd=1 2/integraldisplay0 πCp,ucosθdθ−1 2/integraldisplay2π πCp,lcosθdθ (3.129) The limits of integration in Equation (3.129) are explained as follows. In the ﬁrstintegral, we are integrating from the leading edge (the front point of the cylinder),moving over the topsurface of the cylinder. Hence, θis equal to πat the leading edge and, moving over the top surface, decreases to 0 at the trailing edge. In the second integral, we are integrating from the leading edge to the trailing edgewhile moving over the bottom surface of the cylinder. Hence, θis equal to πat the leading edge and, moving over the bottom surface, increases to 2π at the trailing edge. In Equation (3.129), both C p,uandCp,lare given by the same analytic expression for Cp, namely, Equation (3.126). Hence, Equation (3.129) can be written as cd=−1 2/integraldisplayπ 0Cpcosθdθ−1 2/integraldisplay2π πCpcosθdθ or cd=−1 2/integraldisplay2π 0Cpcosθdθ (3.130) Substituting Equation (3.126) into (3.130), and noting that /integraldisplay2π 0cosθdθ=0 (3.131a) /integraldisplay2π 0sin2θcosθdθ=0 (3.131b) /integraldisplay2π 0sinθcosθdθ=0 (3.131c)274 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow we immediately obtain cd=0 (3.132) Equation (3.132) conﬁrms our intuitive statements made earlier. The drag on a cylinder in an inviscid, incompressible ﬂow is zero, regardless of whether or notthe ﬂow has circulation about the cylinder. The lift on the cylinder can be evaluated in a similar manner as follows. From Equation (1.15) with c f=0, cl=cn=1 c/integraldisplayc 0Cp,ldx−1 c/integraldisplayc 0Cp,udx (3.133) Converting to polar coordinates, we obtain x=Rcosθ dx=− Rsinθdθ (3.134) Substituting Equation (3.134) into (3.133), we have cl=−1 2/integraldisplay2π πCp,lsinθdθ+1 2/integraldisplay0 πCp,usinθdθ (3.135) Again, noting that Cp,landCp,uare both given by the same analytic expression, namely, Equation (3.126), Equation (3.135) becomes cl=−1 2/integraldisplay2π 0Cpsinθdθ (3.136) Substituting Equation (3.126) into (3.136), and noting that /integraldisplay2π 0sinθdθ=0 (3.137a) /integraldisplay2π 0sin3θdθ=0 (3.137b) /integraldisplay2π 0sin2θdθ=π (3.137c) we immediately obtain cl=/Gamma1 RV∞(3.138) From the deﬁnition of cl(see Section 1.5), the lift per unit span L/primecan be obtained from L/prime=q∞Scl=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞Scl (3.139)CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 275 Here, the planform area S=2R(1). Therefore, combining Equations (3.138) and (3.139), we have L/prime=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞2R/Gamma1 RV∞ or L/prime=ρ∞V∞/Gamma1 (3.140) Equation (3.140) gives the lift per unit span for a circular cylinder with circulation /Gamma1. It is a remarkably simple result, and it states that the lift per unit span is directly proportional to circulation. Equation (3.140) is a powerful relation in theoreticalaerodynamics. It is called the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, named after the German mathematician M. Wilhelm Kutta (1867–1944) and the Russian physicist NikolaiE. Joukowski (1847–1921), who independently obtained it during the ﬁrst decadeof twentieth century. We will have more to say about the Kutta-Joukowski theoremin Section 3.16. What are the connections between the above theoretical results and real life? As stated earlier, the prediction of zero drag is totally erroneous—viscous effectscause skin friction and ﬂow separation which always produce a ﬁnite drag. Theinviscid ﬂow treated in this chapter simply does not model the proper physics fordrag calculations. On the other hand, the prediction of lift via Equation (3.140)is quite realistic. Let us return to the wind-tunnel experiments mentioned at thebeginning of this chapter. If a stationary, nonspinning cylinder is placed in alow-speed wind tunnel, the ﬂow ﬁeld will appear as shown in Figure 3.34a. Thestreamlines over the front of the cylinder are similar to theoretical predictions, assketched at the right of Figure 3.26. However, because of viscous effects, the ﬂowseparates over the rear of the cylinder, creating a recirculating ﬂow in the wakedownstream of the body. This separated ﬂow greatly contributes to the ﬁnite dragmeasured for the cylinder. On the other hand, Figure 3.34a shows a reasonably symmetric ﬂow about the horizontal axis, and the measurement of lift is essen-tially zero. Now let us spinthe cylinder in a clockwise direction about its axis. The resulting ﬂow ﬁelds are shown in Figure 3.34b andc. For a moderate amount of spin (Figure 3.34b), the stagnation points move to the lower part of the cylinder,similar to the theoretical ﬂow sketched in Figure 3.33a. If the spin is sufﬁcientlyincreased (Figure 3.34c), the stagnation point lifts off the surface, similar to thetheoretical ﬂow sketched in Figure 3.33c. And what is most important, a ﬁnite lift is measured for the spinning cylinder in the wind tunnel. What is happening here?Why does spinning the cylinder produce lift? In actuality, the friction betweenthe ﬂuid and the surface of the cylinder tends to drag the ﬂuid near the surfacein the same direction as the rotational motion. Superimposed on top of the usualnonspinning ﬂow, this “extra” velocity contribution creates a higher-than-usualvelocity at the top of the cylinder and a lower-than-usual velocity at the bottom, assketched in Figure 3.35. These velocities are assumed to be just outside the viscousboundary layer on the surface. Recall from Bernoulli’s equation that as thevelocity increases, the pressure decreases. Hence, from Figure 3.35, the pressure276 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow (a) Figure 3.34 These ﬂow-ﬁeld pictures were obtained in water, where aluminum ﬁlings were scattered on the surface to show the direction of the streamlines. (a) Shown above is the case for the nonspinning cylinder. (Prandtl, L., and O. G. Tietjens: Applied Hydro and Aeromechanics Based on Lectures of L. Prandtl, United Engineering Trustees Inc.,1934,McGraw-Hill, New York). on the top of the cylinder is lower than on the bottom. This pressure imbalance creates a net upward force, that is, a ﬁnite lift. Therefore, the theoretical predictionembodied in Equation (3.140) that the ﬂow over a circular cylinder can producea ﬁnite lift is veriﬁed by experimental observation. The general ideas discussed above concerning the generation of lift on a spinning circular cylinder in a wind tunnel also apply to a spinning sphere. Thisexplains why a baseball pitcher can throw a curve and how a golfer can hit ahook or slice—all of which are due to nonsymmetric ﬂows about the spinningbodies, and hence the generation of an aerodynamic force perpendicular to thebody’s angular velocity vector. This phenomenon is called the Magnus effect, named after the German engineer who ﬁrst observed and explained it in Berlinin 1852. It is interesting to note that a rapidly spinning cylinder can produce a much higher lift than an airplane wing of the same planform area; however, the dragon the cylinder is also much higher than a well-designed wing. As a result, theMagnus effect is not employed for powered ﬂight. On the other hand, in the 1920s,CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 277 (b) (c) Figure 3.34 (continued) These ﬂow-ﬁeld pictures were obtained in water, where aluminum ﬁlings were scattered on the surface to show the direction of the streamlines.

In combination with the wind,this spinning cylinder provided propulsion for the boat. Moreover, by the actionof two cylinders in tandem and rotating in opposite directions, Flettner was able toturn the boat around. Flettner’s device was a technical success, but an economicfailure because the maintenance on the machinery to spin the cylinders at thenecessary high rotational speeds was too costly. Today, the Magnus effect has animportant inﬂuence on the performance of spinning missiles; indeed, a certainamount of modern high-speed aerodynamic research has focused on the Magnusforces on spinning bodies for missile applications. EXAMPLE 3.16 Consider the lifting ﬂow over a circular cylinder. The lift coefﬁcient is 5. Calculate the peak (negative) pressure coefﬁcient. ■Solution Examining Figure 3.32, note that the maximum velocity for the nonlifting ﬂow over a cylinder is 2 V∞and that it occurs at the top and bottom points on the cylinder. When the vortex in Figure 3.32 is added to the ﬂow ﬁeld, the direction of the vortex velocity is in thesame direction as the ﬂow on the top of the cylinder, but opposes the ﬂow on the bottom of the cylinder. Hence, the maximum velocity for the lifting case occurs at the topof the cylinder and is equal to the sum of the nonlifting value, −2V ∞, and the vortex, −/Gamma1/ 2πR. (Note: We are still following the usual sign convention; since the velocity on the top of the cylinder is in the opposite direction of increasing θfor the polar coordinate system, the velocity magnitudes here are negative.) Hence, V=−2V∞−/Gamma1 2πR(E.1) The lift coefﬁcient and /Gamma1are related through Equation (3.138): cl=/Gamma1 RV∞=5 Hence,/Gamma1 R=5V∞ (E.2)CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 279 Substituting Equation (E.2) into (E.1), we have V=−2V∞−5 2πV∞=−2.796 V∞ (E.3) Substituting Equation (E.3) into Equation (3.38), we obtain Cp=1−/parenleftbiggV V∞/parenrightbigg2 =1−(2.796)2=−6.82 This example is designed in part to make the following point. Recall that, for an inviscid, incompressible ﬂow, the distribution of Cpover the surface of a body depends only on the shape and orientation of the body—the ﬂow properties such as velocity and density are irrelevant here. Recall Equation (3.101), which gives Cpas a function of θonly, namely, Cp=1−4 sin2θ. However, for the case of lifting ﬂow, the distribution of Cpover the surface is a function of one additional parameter—namely, the lift coefﬁcient. Clearly, in this example, only the valueofc lis given. However, this is powerful enough to deﬁne the ﬂow uniquely; the value of Cpat any point on the surface follows directly from the value of lift coefﬁcient, as demonstrated in the above problem. EXAMPLE 3.17 For the ﬂow ﬁeld in Example 3.16, calculate the location of the stagnation points and the points on the cylinder where the pressure equals freestream static pressure. ■Solution From Equation (3.123), the stagnation points are given by θ=arcsin/parenleftbigg −/Gamma1 4πV∞R/parenrightbigg From Example 3.16, /Gamma1 RV∞=5 Thus, θ=arcsin/parenleftbigg −5 4π/parenrightbigg =203.4◦and 336.6◦ To ﬁnd the locations where p=p∞, ﬁrst construct a formula for the pressure coefﬁcient on the cylinder surface: Cp=1−/parenleftbiggV V∞/parenrightbigg2 where V=−2V∞sinθ−/Gamma1 2πR280 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Thus,Cp=1−/parenleftbigg −2 sin θ−/Gamma1 2πR/parenrightbigg2 =1−4 sin2θ−2/Gamma1sinθ πRV∞−/parenleftbigg/Gamma1 2πRV∞/parenrightbigg2 From Example 3.16, /Gamma1/RV∞=5. Thus, Cp=1−4 sin2θ−10 πsinθ−/parenleftbigg5 2π/parenrightbigg2 =0.367−3.183 sin θ−4 sin2θ A check on this equation can be obtained by calculating Cpatθ=90◦and seeing if it agrees with the result obtained in Example 3.16. For θ=90◦, we have Cp=0.367−3.183−4=−6.82 This is the same result as in Example 3.16; the equation checks. To ﬁnd the values of θwhere p=p∞, setCp=0: 0=0.367−3.183 sin θ−4 sin2θ From the quadratic formula, sinθ=3.183±/radicalbig (3.183)2+5.872 −8=−0.897 or 0.102 Hence, θ=243.8◦and 296.23◦ Also, θ=5.85◦and 174.1◦ There are four points on the circular cylinder where p=p∞. These are sketched in Figure 3.36, along with the stagnation point locations. As shown in Example 3.16, the minimum pressure occurs at the top of the cylinder and is equal to p∞−6.82q∞.A local minimum pressure occurs at the bottom of the cylinder, where θ=3π/2. This local minimum is given by Cp=0.367−3.183 sin3π 2−4 sin23π 2 =0.367+3.183−4=−0.45 Hence, at the bottom of the cylinder, p=p∞−0.45q∞.CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 281 Figure 3.36 Values of pressure at various locations on the surface of a circular cylinder; lifting case with ﬁnite circulation. The values of pressure correspond to the case discussed in Example 3.17. EXAMPLE 3.18 Consider the lifting ﬂow over a circular cylinder with a diameter of 0.5 m. The freestream velocity is 25 m/s, and the maximum velocity on the surface of the cylinder is 75 m/s. Thefreestream conditions are those for a standard altitude of 3 km. Calculate the lift per unitspan on the cylinder. ■Solution From Appendix D, at an altitude of 3 km, ρ=0.90926 kg/m3. The maximum velocity occurs at the top of the cylinder, where θ=90◦. From Equation (3.125), Vθ=−2V∞sinθ−/Gamma1 2πR Atθ=90◦, Vθ=−2V∞−/Gamma1 2πR or, /Gamma1=−2πR(Vθ+2V∞)282 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Recalling our sign convention that /Gamma1is positive in the clockwise direction, and Vθis negative in the clockwise direction (reﬂect again on Figure 3.32), we have Vθ=− 75m/s Hence, /Gamma1=− 2πR(Vθ+2V∞)=−2π(0.25)[−75 +2(25)] /Gamma1=− 2π(0.25)(−25) =39.27 m2/s From Equation (3.140), the lift per unit span is L/prime=ρ∞V∞/Gamma1 L/prime=(0.90926)(25)(39.27) =892.7 N/m Comment: In the course of this example, we have calculated a value for circulation; /Gamma1=39.27 m2/s. In English engineering units, this is /Gamma1=39.27m2 s/parenleftbigg3.28 ft 1m2/parenrightbigg =422.5ft2 s. In Example 3.15 we commented on the numerical value of circulation; in that case we obtained a value of 18,430 ft2/s, much larger than in the present example. But we are still seeing values of /Gamma1in the hundreds, if not in the thousands—just an interesting observation. 3.16 THE KUTTA-JOUKOWSKI THEOREM AND THE GENERATION OF LIFT Although the result given by Equation (3.140) was derived for a circular cylin- der, it applies in general to cylindrical bodies of arbitrary cross section. Forexample, consider the incompressible ﬂow over an airfoil section, as sketchedin Figure 3.37. Let curve Abe any curve in the ﬂow enclosing the airfoil. If the airfoil is producing lift, the velocity ﬁeld around the airfoil will be such that theline integral of velocity around Awill be ﬁnite, that is, the circulation /Gamma1≡ /contintegraldisplay AV·ds is ﬁnite. In turn, the lift per unit span L/primeon the airfoil will be given by the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, as embodied in Equation (3.140): L/prime=ρ∞V∞/Gamma1 (3.140) This result underscores the importance of the concept of circulation, deﬁned inSection 2.13. The Kutta-Joukowski theorem states that lift per unit span on atwo-dimensional body is directly proportional to the circulation around the body.Indeed, the concept of circulation is so important at this stage of our discussionthat you should reread Section 2.13 before proceeding further. The general derivation of Equation (3.140) for bodies of arbitrary cross sec- tion can be carried out using the method of complex variables. Such mathematicsCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 283 V/H11009AB p/H11009L/H11032AV · ds = /H9003 BV · ds = 0 Figure 3.37 Circulation around a lifting airfoil. is beyond the scope of this book. (It can be shown that arbitrary functions of com- plex variables are general solutions of Laplace’s equation, which in turn governsincompressible potential ﬂow. Hence, more advanced treatments of such ﬂowsutilize the mathematics of complex variables as an important tool. See Refer-ence 9 for a particularly lucid treatment of inviscid, incompressible ﬂow at amore advanced level.) In Section 3.15, the lifting ﬂow over a circular cylinder was synthesized by superimposing a uniform ﬂow, a doublet, and a vortex. Recall that all three ele-mentary ﬂows are irrotational at all points, except for the vortex, which has inﬁnitevorticity at the origin. Therefore, the lifting ﬂow over a cylinder as shown in Fig-ure 3.33 is irrotational at every point except at the origin. If we take the circulationaround any curve notenclosing the origin, we obtain from Equation (2.137) the result that /Gamma1=0. It is only when we choose a curve that encloses the origin, where ∇×Vis inﬁnite, that Equation (2.137) yields a ﬁnite /Gamma1, equal to the strength of the vortex. The same can be said about the ﬂow over the airfoil inFigure 3.37. As we show in Chapter 4, the ﬂow outside the airfoil is irrotational, and the circulation around any closed curve notenclosing the airfoil (such as curve Bin Figure 3.37) is consequently zero. On the other hand, we also show in Chapter 4 that the ﬂow over an airfoil is synthesized by distributing vortices eitheron the surface or inside the airfoil. These vortices have the usual singularities in∇×V, and therefore, if we choose a curve that encloses the airfoil (such as curve Ain Figure 3.37), Equation (2.137) yields a ﬁnite value of /Gamma1, equal to the sumof the vortex strengths distributed on or inside the airfoil. The important point hereis that, in the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, the value of /Gamma1used in Equation (3.140) must be evaluated around a closed curve that encloses the body; the curve can be otherwise arbitrary, but it must have the body inside it. At this stage, let us pause and assess our thoughts. The approach we have discussed above—the deﬁnition of circulation and the use of Equation (3.140) to284 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow obtain the lift—is the essence of the circulation theory of lift in aerodynamics. Its development at the turn of the twentieth century created a breakthrough in aerodynamics. However, let us keep things in perspective. The circulation theoryof lift is an alternative way of thinking about the generation of lift on an aero- dynamic body. Keep in mind that the true physical sources of aerodynamic forceon a body are the pressure and shear stress distributions exerted on the surface ofthe body, as explained in Section 1.5. The Kutta-Joukowski theorem is simply analternative way of expressing the consequences of the surface pressure distribu- tion; it is a mathematical expression that is consistent with the special tools wehave developed for the analysis of inviscid, incompressible ﬂow. Indeed, recallthat Equation (3.140) was derived in Section 3.15 by integrating the pressure dis-tribution over the surface. Therefore, it is not quite proper to say that circulation“causes” lift. Rather, lift is “caused” by the net imbalance of the surface pres-sure distribution, and circulation is simply a deﬁned quantity determined fromthe same pressures. The relation between the surface pressure distribution (whichproduces lift L /prime) and circulation is given by Equation (3.140). However, in the theory of incompressible, potential ﬂow, it is generally much easier to determinethe circulation around the body rather than calculate the detailed surface pressuredistribution. Therein lies the power of the circulation theory of lift. Consequently, the theoretical analysis of lift on two-dimensional bodies in incompressible, inviscid ﬂow focuses on the calculation of the circulation aboutthe body. Once /Gamma1is obtained, then the lift per unit span follows directly from the Kutta-Joukowski theorem. As a result, in subsequent sections we constantlyaddress the question: How can we calculate the circulation for a given body in agiven incompressible, inviscid ﬂow? 3.17 NONLIFTING FLOWS OVER ARBITRARY BODIES: THE NUMERICAL SOURCE PANEL METHOD In this section, we return to the consideration of nonlifting ﬂows. Recall that we have already dealt with the nonlifting ﬂows over a semi-inﬁnite body and aRankine oval and both the nonlifting and the lifting ﬂows over a circular cylinder.For those cases, we added our elementary ﬂows in certain ways and discoveredthat the dividing streamlines turned out to ﬁt the shapes of such special bodies.However, this indirect method of starting with a given combination of elementaryﬂows and seeing what body shape comes out of it can hardly be used in a practicalsense for bodies of arbitrary shape. For example, consider the airfoil in Figure 3.37.Do we know in advance the correct combination of elementary ﬂows to synthesizethe ﬂow over this speciﬁed body? The answer is no. Rather, what we want is adirect method; that is, let us specify the shape of an arbitrary body and solve for the distribution of singularities which, in combination with a uniform stream, producethe ﬂow over the given body. The purpose of this section is to present such a directmethod, limited for the present to nonlifting ﬂows. We consider a numericalmethod appropriate for solution on a high-speed digital computer. The techniqueAnderson-3930659 book August 29, 2016 12:17 CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 285 Figure 3.38 Source sheet. is called the source panel method, which, since the late 1960s, has become a standard aerodynamic tool in industry and most research laboratories. In fact, the numerical solution of potential ﬂows by both source and vortex panel techniqueshas revolutionized the analysis of low-speed ﬂows. We return to various numericalpanel techniques in Chapters 4 through 6. As a modern student of aerodynamics,it is necessary for you to become familiar with the fundamentals of such panelmethods. The purpose of the present section is to introduce the basic ideas of thesource panel method, which is a technique for the numerical solution of nonliftingﬂows over arbitrary bodies. First, let us extend the concept of a source or sink introduced in Section 3.10. In that section, we dealt with a single line source, as sketched in Figure 3.21.Now imagine that we have an inﬁnite number of such line sources side by side,where the strength of each line source is inﬁnitesimally small. These side-by-sideline sources form a source sheet, as shown in perspective in the upper left of Figure 3.38. If we look along the series of line sources (looking along the zaxis in Figure 3.38), the source sheet will appear as sketched at the lower right ofFigure 3.38. Here, we are looking at an edge view of the sheet; the line sourcesare all perpendicular to the page. Let sbe the distance measured along the source sheet in the edge view. Deﬁne λ=λ(s)to be the source strength per unit length along s . [To keep things in perspective, recall from Section 3.10 that the strength of a single line source /Lambda1was deﬁned as the volume ﬂow rate per unit depth, that is, per unit length in the zdirection. Typical units for /Lambda1are square meters per second or square feet per second. In turn, the strength of a source sheet λ(s)is the volume ﬂow rate per unit depth (in the zdirection) and per unit length (in thesdirection). Typical units for λare meters per second or feet per second.] Therefore, the strength of an inﬁnitesimal portion dsof the sheet, as shown in Figure 3.38, is λds. This small section of the source sheet can be treated as a distinct source of strength λds. Now consider point Pin the ﬂow, located a distance rfrom ds; the cartesian coordinates of Pare(x,y). The small section286 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Flow over the body of given shapeUniform flow Source sheet on surface of body, with /H9261(s)calculated to make thebody surface a streamline/H9261 = /H9261(s) V/H11009/H11001/H11005 Figure 3.39 Superposition of a uniform ﬂow and a source sheet on a body of given shape, to produce the ﬂow over the body. of the source sheet of strength λdsinduces an inﬁnitesimally small potential dφ at point P. From Equation (3.67), dφis given by dφ=λds 2πlnr (3.141) The complete velocity potential at point P, induced by the entire source sheet from atob, is obtained by integrating Equation (3.141): φ(x,y)=/integraldisplayb aλds 2πlnr (3.142) Note that, in general, λ(s)can change from positive to negative along the sheet; that is, the “source” sheet is really a combination of line sources and line sinks. Next, consider a given body of arbitrary shape in a ﬂow with freestream velocity V∞, as shown in Figure 3.39. Let us cover the surface of the prescribed body with a source sheet, where the strength λ(s)varies in such a fashion that the combined action of the uniform ﬂow and the source sheet makes the airfoil surface a streamline of the ﬂow. Our problem now becomes one of ﬁnding the appropriateλ(s). The solution of this problem is carried out numerically, as follows. Let us approximate the source sheet by a series of straight panels, as shown in Figure 3.40. Moreover, let the source strength λper unit length be constant over a given panel, but allow it to vary from one panel to the next. That is,if there are a total of npanels, the source panel strengths per unit length are λ 1,λ2,...,λ j...,λ n. These panel strengths are unknown; the main thrust of the panel technique is to solve for λj,j=1 ton, such that the body surface becomes a streamline of the ﬂow. This boundary condition is imposed numerically bydeﬁning the midpoint of each panel to be a control point and by determining the λ j’s such that the normal component of the ﬂow velocity is zero at each control point. Let us now quantify this strategy. LetPbe a point located at (x,y)in the ﬂow, and let rpjbe the distance from any point on the jth panel to P, as shown in Figure 3.40.

Recall that the boundary condition is applied at the control points; that is, the normal component of the ﬂow velocity is zero at the control points. To evaluate this component, ﬁrst consider the component of freestream velocity perpendicular tothe panel. Let n ibe the unit vector normal to the ith panel, directed out of the body, as shown in Figure 3.40. Also, note that the slope of the ith panel is (dy/dx)i.I n general, the freestream velocity will be at some incidence angle αto the xaxis,288 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow as shown in Figure 3.40. Therefore, inspection of the geometry of Figure 3.40 reveals that the component of V∞normal to the ith panel is V∞,n=V∞·ni=V∞cosβi (3.148) where βiis the angle between V∞andni. Note that V∞,nis positive when directed away from the body, and negative when directed toward the body. The normal component of velocity induced at (xi,yi)by the source panels is, from Equation (3.146), Vn=∂ ∂ni[φ(xi,yi)] (3.149) where the derivative is taken in the direction of the outward unit normal vector, andhence, again, V nis positive when directed away from the body. When the derivative in Equation (3.149) is carried out, rijappears in the denominator. Consequently, a singular point arises on the ith panel because when j=i, at the control point itself rij=0. It can be shown that when j=i, the contribution to the deriva- tive is simply λi/2. Hence, Equation (3.149) combined with Equation (3.146) becomes Vn=λi 2+n/summationdisplay j=1 (j/negationslash=1)λj 2π/integraldisplay j∂ ∂ni(lnrij)dsj (3.150) In Equation (3.150), the ﬁrst term λi/2 is the normal velocity induced at the ith control point by the ith panel itself, and the summation is the normal velocity induced at the ith control point by all the other panels. The normal component of the ﬂow velocity at the ith control point is the sum of that due to the freestream [Equation (3.148)] and that due to the source panels[Equation (3.150)]. The boundary condition states that this sum must be zero: V ∞,n+Vn=0 (3.151) Substituting Equations (3.148) and (3.150) into (3.151), we obtain λi 2+n/summationdisplay j=1 (j/negationslash=1)λj 2π/integraldisplay j∂ ∂ni(lnrij)dsj+V∞cosβi=0 (3.152) Equation (3.152) is the crux of the source panel method. The values of the integralsin Equation (3.152) depend simply on the panel geometry; they are not propertiesof the ﬂow. Let I i,jbe the value of this integral when the control point is on the ith panel and the integral is over the jth panel. Then Equation (3.152) can be written as λi 2+n/summationdisplay j=1 (j/negationslash=1)λj 2πIi,j+V∞cosβi=0 (3.153) Equation (3.153) is a linear algebraic equation with nunknowns λ1,λ2,...,λ n. It represents the ﬂow boundary condition evaluated at the control point of the ith panel. Now apply the boundary condition to the control points of allthe panels; that is, in Equation (3.153), let i=1,2,...,n . The results will be a system of nCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 289 linear algebraic equations with nunknowns (λ1,λ2,...,λ n), which can be solved simultaneously by conventional numerical methods. Look what has happened! After solving the system of equations represented by Equation (3.153) with i=1,2,...,n , we now have the distribution of source panel strengths which, in an appropriate fashion, cause the body surface in Fig- ure 3.40 to be a streamline of the ﬂow. This approximation can be made moreaccurate by increasing the number of panels, hence more closely representing thesource sheet of continuously varying strength λ(s)shown in Figure 3.39. Indeed, the accuracy of the source panel method is amazingly good; a circular cylindercan be accurately represented by as few as 8 panels, and most airfoil shapes, by50 to 100 panels. (For an airfoil, it is desirable to cover the leading-edge regionwith a number of small panels to represent accurately the rapid surface curvatureand to use larger panels over the relatively ﬂat portions of the body. Note that, ingeneral, all the panels in Figure 3.40 can be different lengths.) Once the λ i’s(i=1,2,...,n )are obtained, the velocity tangent to the sur- face at each control point can be calculated as follows. Let sbe the distance along the body surface, measured positive from front to rear, as shown in Figure 3.40.The component of freestream velocity tangent to the surface is V ∞,s=V∞sinβi (3.154) The tangential velocity Vsat the control point of the ith panel induced by all the panels is obtained by differentiating Equation (3.146) with respect to s: Vs=∂φ ∂s=n/summationdisplay j=1λj 2π/integraldisplay j∂ ∂s(lnrij)dsj (3.155) [The tangential velocity on a ﬂat source panel induced by the panel itself is zero;hence, in Equation (3.155), the term corresponding to j=iis zero. This is easily seen by intuition, because the panel can only emit volume ﬂow from itssurface in a direction perpendicular to the panel itself.] The total surface velocityat the ith control point V iis the sum of the contribution from the freestream [Equation (3.154)] and from the source panels [Equation (3.155)]: Vi=V∞,s+Vs=V∞sinβi+n/summationdisplay j=1λj 2π/integraldisplay j∂ ∂s(lnrij)dsj (3.156) In turn, the pressure coefﬁcient at the ith control point is obtained from Equa- tion (3.38): Cp,i=1−/parenleftbiggVi V∞/parenrightbigg2 In this fashion, the source panel method gives the pressure distribution over thesurface of a nonlifting body of arbitrary shape. When you carry out a source panel solution as described above, the accuracy of your results can be tested as follows. Let S jbe the length of the jth panel. Recall that λjis the strength of the jth panel per unit length. Hence, the strength of the jth panel itself is λiSj. For a closed body, such as in Figure 3.40, the sum290 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow of all the source and sink strengths must be zero, or else the body itself would be adding or absorbing mass from the ﬂow—an impossible situation for the case weare considering here. Hence, the values of the λ j’s obtained above should obey the relation n/summationdisplay j=1λjSj=0 (3.157) Equation (3.157) provides an independent check on the accuracy of the numericalresults. EXAMPLE 3.19 Calculate the pressure coefﬁcient distribution around a circular cylinder using the source panel technique. ■Solution We choose to cover the body with eight panels of equal length, as shown in Figure 3.41.This choice is arbitrary; however, experience has shown that, for the case of a circularcylinder, the arrangement shown in Figure 3.41 provides sufﬁcient accuracy. The panelsare numbered from 1 to 8, and the control points are shown by the dots in the center ofeach panel. Let us evaluate the integrals I i,jwhich appear in Equation (3.153). Consider Fig- ure 3.42, which illustrates two arbitrary chosen panels. In Figure 3.42, (xi,yi)are the coordinates of the control point of the ith panel and (xj,yj)are the running coordinates over the entire jth panel. The coordinates of the boundary points for the ith panel are (Xi,Yi)and(Xi+1,Yi+1); similarly, the coordinates of the boundary points for the jth panel are (Xj,Yj)and(Xj+1,Yj+1). In this problem, V∞is in the xdirection; hence, the angles between the xaxis and the unit vectors niandnjareβiandβj, respectively. Note that, in general, both βiandβjvary from 0 to 2π .

We now apply Equation (3.163) to the circular cylinder shown in Figure 3.41. For purposes of illustration, let us choose panel 4 as the ith panel and panel 2 as the jth panel; that is, let us calculate I4,2. From the geometry of Figure 3.41, assuming a unit radius for the cylinder, we see that Xj=−0.9239 Xj+1=−0.3827 Yj=0.3827 Yj+1=0.9239 /Phi1i=315◦/Phi1j=45◦ xi=0.6533 yi=0.6533 Hence, substituting these numbers into the above formulas, we obtain A=−1.3065 B=2.5607 C=−1D=1.3065 Sj=0.7654 E=0.9239 Inserting the above values into Equation (3.163), we obtain I4,2=0.4018 Return to Figures 3.41 and 3.42. If we now choose panel 1 as the jth panel, keeping panel 4 as the ith panel, we obtain, by means of a similar calculation, I4,1=0.4074. Similarly, I4,3=0.3528, I4,5=0.3528, I4,6=0.4018, I4,7=0.4074, and I4,8=0.4084. Return to Equation (3.153), which is evaluated for the ith panel in Figures 3.40 and 3.42. Written for panel 4, Equation (3.153) becomes (after multiplying each term by 2 andCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 293 noting that βi=45◦for panel 4) 0.4074λ 1+0.4018λ 2+0.3528λ 3+πλ4+0.3528λ 5 +0.4018λ 6+0.4074λ 7+0.4084λ 8=−0.7071 2π V∞ (3.164) Equation (3.164) is a linear algebraic equation in terms of the eight unknowns, λ1,λ2,..., λ8. If we now evaluate Equation (3.153) for each of the seven other panels, we obtain a total of eight equations, including Equation (3.164), which can be solved simultaneously for the eight unknown λ’s. The results are λ1/2πV∞=0.3765 λ2/2πV∞=0.2662 λ3/2πV∞=0 λ4/2πV∞=−0.2662 λ5/2πV∞=−0.3765 λ6/2πV∞=−0.2662 λ7/2πV∞=0 λ8/2πV∞=0.2662 Note the symmetrical distribution of the λ’s, which is to be expected for the nonlifting circular cylinder. Also, as a check on the above solution, return to Equation (3.157). Sinceeach panel in Figure 3.41 has the same length, Equation (3.157) can be written simply as n/summationdisplay j=1λj=0 Substituting the values for the λ’s obtained into Equation (3.157), we see that the equation is identically satisﬁed. The velocity at the control point of the ith panel can be obtained from Equa- tion (3.156). In that equation, the integral over the jth panel is a geometric quantity that is evaluated in a similar manner as before. The result is /integraldisplay j∂ ∂s(lnrij)ds j=D−AC 2ElnS2 j+2ASj+B B(3.165) −C/parenleftbigg tan−1Sj+A E−tan−1A E/parenrightbigg With the integrals in Equation (3.156) evaluated by Equation (3.165), and with the valuesforλ 1,λ2,...,λ 8obtained above inserted into Equation (3.156), we obtain the veloci- tiesV1,V2,..., V8.

The resulting theoretical streamlines are sketched in Figure 3.26, char-acterized by a symmetrical pattern where the ﬂow “closes in” behind the cylinder.As a result, the pressure distribution over the front of the cylinder is the same asthat over the rear (see Figure 3.29). This leads to the theoretical result that thepressure drag is zero—d’Alembert’s paradox. The real ﬂow over a circular cylinder is quite different from that studied in Section 3.13, the difference due to the inﬂuence of friction. Moreover, the dragcoefﬁcient for the real ﬂow over a cylinder is certainly not zero. For a viscous incompressible ﬂow, the results of dimensional analysis (Section 1.7) clearlydemonstrate that the drag coefﬁcient is a function of the Reynolds number. Thevariation of C D=f(Re) for a circular cylinder is shown in Figure 3.44, which is based on a wealth of experimental data. Here, Re =(ρ∞V∞d)/μ∞, where dis the diameter of the cylinder. Note that CDis very large for the extremely small values of Re <1, but decreases monotonically until Re ≈300,000. At this Reynolds number, there is a precipitous drop of CDfrom a value near 1 to about 0.3, then a slight recovery to about 0.6 for Re =107.(Note: These results are consistent with the comparison shown in Figure 1.54d ande, contrasting CD for a circular cylinder at low and high Re.) What causes this precipitous drop in CDwhen the Reynolds number reaches about 300,000? A detailed answer must await our discussion of viscous ﬂow in Chapter 4, and later in Part 4. However,we state now that the phenomenon is caused by a sudden transition of laminarﬂow within the boundary layer at the lower values of Re to a turbulent boundaryCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 295 Figure 3.44 Variation of cylinder-drag coefﬁcient with Reynolds number. (Source: Experimental data as compiled in Panton, Ronald, Incompressible Flow, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1984). layer at the higher values of Re. Why does a turbulent boundary layer result in a smaller CDfor this case? Stay tuned; the answer is given in Chapter 4. The variation of CDshown in Figure 3.44 across a range of Re from 10−1 to 107is accompanied by tremendous variations in the qualitative aspects of the ﬂow ﬁeld, as itemized, and as sketched in Figure 3.45. 1.For very low values of Re, say, 0 <Re<4, the streamlines are almost (but not exactly) symmetrical, and the ﬂow is attached, as sketched in Figure 3.45a. This regime of viscous ﬂow is called Stokes ﬂow; it is characterized by a near balance of pressure forces with friction forcesacting on any given ﬂuid element; the ﬂow velocity is so low that inertiaeffects are very small. A photograph of this type of ﬂow is shown inFigure 3.46, which shows the ﬂow of water around a circular cylinderwhere Re =1.54. The streamlines are made visible by aluminum powder on the surface, along with a time exposure of the ﬁlm. 2.For 4<Re<40, the ﬂow becomes separated on the back of the cylinder, forming two distinct, stable vortices that remain in the position shown inFigure 3.45b. A photograph of this type of ﬂow is given in Figure 3.47,where Re =26. 3.As Re is increased above 40, the ﬂow behind the cylinder becomes unstable;the vortices which were in a ﬁxed position in Figure 3.45b now are alternately shed from the body in a regular fashion and ﬂow downstream.296 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Figure 3.45 Various types of ﬂow over a circular cylinder.

A Karman vortex street exists behind the cylinder at this Reynolds number. (© H. S. Photos/Alamy). This ﬂow is sketched in Figure 3.45c. A photograph of this type of ﬂow is shown in Figure 3.48, where Re =140. This is a water ﬂow where the streaklines are made visible by the electrolytic precipitation method. (In thismethod, metal plating on the cylinder surface acts as an anode, whiteparticles are precipitated by electrolysis near the anode, and these particlessubsequently ﬂow downstream, forming a streakline. The deﬁnition of a streakline is given in Section 2.11.) The alternately shed vortex patternshown in Figures 3.45c and 3.48 is called a Karman vortex street, named after Theodor von K´ arm´ an, who began to study and analyze this pattern in1911 while at G¨ ottingen University in Germany. (von Karman subsequentlyhad a long and very distinguished career in aerodynamics, moving to theCalifornia Institute of Technology in 1930, and becoming America’sbest-known aerodynamicist in the mid-twentieth century. An autobiographyof von Karman was published in 1967; see Reference 46. This reference is“must” reading for anyone interested in a riveting perspective on the historyof aerodynamics in the twentieth century.) 4.As the Reynolds number is increased to large numbers, the Karman vortexstreet becomes turbulent and begins to metamorphose into a distinct wake.The laminar boundary layer on the cylinder separates from the surface onthe forward face, at a point about 80 ◦from the stagnation point. This is sketched in Figure 3.45d. The value of the Reynolds number for this ﬂow ison the order of 10 Note, from Figure 3.44, that CDis a relatively constant value near unity for 103<Re<3×105. 5.For 3×105<Re<3×106, the separation of the laminar boundary layer still takes place on the forward face of the cylinder. However, in the freeshear layer over the top of the separated region, transition to turbulent ﬂowtakes place. The ﬂow then reattaches on the back face of the cylinder, butseparates again at about 120 ◦around the body measured from the stagnationCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 299 point. This ﬂow is sketched in Figure 3.45e. This transition to turbulent ﬂow, and the corresponding thinner wake (comparing Figure 3.45e with Figure 3.45d ), reduces the pressure drag on the cylinder and is responsible for the precipitous drop in CDat Re=3×105shown in Figure 3.44. (More details on this phenomenon are covered in Chapter 4 and Part 4.) 6.For Re >3×106, the boundary layer transits directly to turbulent ﬂow at some point on the forward face, and the boundary layer remains totallyattached over the surface until it separates at an angular location slightlyless than 120 ◦on the back surface. For this regime of ﬂow, CDactually increases slightly with increasing Re because the separation points on theback surface begin to move closer to the top and bottom of the cylinder,producing a fatter wake, and hence larger pressure drag. In summary, from the photographs and sketches in this section, we see that the real ﬂow over a circular cylinder is dominated by friction effects, namely, the separation of the ﬂow over the rearward face of the cylinder. In turn, a ﬁnitepressure drag is created on the cylinder, and d’Alembert’s paradox is resolved. Let us examine the production of drag more closely. The theoretical pressure distribution over the surface of a cylinder in an inviscid, incompressible ﬂowwas given in Figure 3.29. In contrast, several real pressure distributions basedon experimental measurements for different Reynolds numbers are shown inFigure 3.49, and are compared with the theoretical inviscid ﬂow results obtainedin Section 3.13. Note that theory and experiment agree well on the forward face Figure 3.49 Pressure distribution over a circular cylinder in low-speed ﬂow. Comparison of the theoretical pressure distribution with two experimental pressure distributions—one for a subcritical Re and the other for a supercritical Re.300 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow of the cylinder, but that dramatic differences occur over the rearward face. The theoretical results show the pressure decreasing around the forward face fromthe initial total pressure at the stagnation point, reaching a minimum pressureat the top and bottom of the cylinder (θ =90 ◦and 270◦), and then increasing again over the rearward face, recovering to the total pressure at the rear stagnationpoint. In contrast, in the real case where ﬂow separation occurs, the pressures arerelatively constant in the separated region over the rearward face and have valuesslightly less than freestream pressure. (In regions of separated ﬂow, the pressurefrequently exhibits a nearly constant value.) In the separated region over therearward face, the pressure clearly does not recover to the higher values that existon the front face. There is a net imbalance of the pressure distribution betweenthe front and back faces, with the pressures on the front being higher than on theback, and this imbalance produces the drag on the cylinder. Return to Figure 3.44, and examine again the variation of C Das a function of Re. The regimes associated with the very low Reynolds numbers, such asStokes ﬂow for Re ≈1, are usually of no interest to aeronautical applications. For example, consider a circular cylinder in an airﬂow of 30 m/s (about 100 ft/s,or 68 mi/h) at standard sea level conditions, where ρ ∞=1.23 kg/m3andμ∞= 1.79×10−5kg/(m ·s). The smaller the diameter of the cylinder, the smaller will be the Reynolds number. Question: What is the required cylinder diameter in order to have Re =1? The answer is obtained from Re=ρ∞V∞d μ∞=1 Hence,d=μ∞ ρ∞V∞=1.79×10−5 (1.23)(30)=4×10−7m To have Re =1 for the above conditions, the diameter of the cylinder would have to be extremely small; note that the value of d=4×10−7m is only slightly larger than the mean free path at standard sea level, which is 6.6 ×10−8m. (See Section 1.10 for the deﬁnition of the mean free path.) Clearly, Reynolds numberson the order of unity are of little practical aerodynamic importance. If this is so, then what values of Re for the ﬂow over cylinders are of practical importance? For one such example, consider the wing wires between the upperand lower wings on a World War I biplane, such as the SPAD XIII shown inFigure 3.50. The diameter of these wires is about 3 32in, or 0.0024 m. The top speed of the SPAD was 130 mi/h, or 57.8 m/s. For this velocity at standard sealevel, we have Re=ρ ∞V∞d μ∞=(1.23)(57.8)(0.0024) 1.79×10−5=9532 With this value of Re, we are beginning to enter the world of practical aerody-namics for the ﬂow over cylinders. It is interesting to note that, from Figure 3.44, C D=1 for the wires on the SPAD. In terms of airplane aerodynamics, this is a high drag coefﬁcient for any component of an aircraft. Indeed, the bracing wiresCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 301 Figure 3.50 The French SPAD XIII, an example of a strut-and-wire biplane from World War I. Captain Eddie Rickenbacker is shown at the front of the airplane. (© MPI/Stringer/ Getty Images). used on biplanes of the World War I era were a source of high drag for the aircraft, so much so that early in the war, bracing wire with a symmetric airfoil-like crosssection was utilized to help reduce this drag. Such wire was developed by theBritish at the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough, and was ﬁrst tested exper-imentally as early as 1914 on an SE-4 biplane. Interestingly enough, the SPADused ordinary round wire, and in spite of this was the fastest of all World War Iaircraft. This author was struck by another example of the effect of cylinder drag while traveling in Charleston, South Carolina, shortly after hurricane Hugo dev-astated the area on September 28, 1989. Traveling north out of Charleston onU.S. Route 17, near the small ﬁshing town of McClellanville, one passes throughthe Francis Marion National Forest. This forest was virtually destroyed by thehurricane; 60-ft pine trees were snapped off near their base, and approximately8 out of every 10 trees were down. The sight bore an eerie resemblance to scenesfrom the battleﬁelds in France during World War I. What type of force can destroyan entire forest in this fashion? To answer this question, we note that the WeatherBureau measured wind gusts as high as 175 mi/h during the hurricane. Let usapproximate the wind force on a typical 60-ft pine tree by the aerodynamic dragon a cylinder of a length of 60 ft and a diameter of 5 ft. Since V=175 mi/h = 256.7 ft/s,ρ ∞=0.002377 slug/ft3, andμ∞=3.7373 ×10−7slug/(ft ·s), then302 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow the Reynolds number is Re=ρ∞V∞d μ∞=(0.002377)(256.7)(5) 3.7373 ×10−7=8.16×106 Examining Figure 3.44, we see that CD=0.7. Since CDis based on the drag per unit length of the cylinder as well as the projected frontal area, we have for the total drag exerted on an entire tree that is 60 ft tall D=q∞SC D=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞(d)(60) CD =1 2(0.002377)(256.7)2(5)(60)(0.7) =16,446 lb a 16,000 lb force on the tree—it is no wonder a whole forest was destroyed.(In the above analysis, we neglected the end effects of the ﬂow over the end ofthe vertical cylinder. Moreover, we did not correct the standard sea level densityfor the local reduction in barometric pressure experienced inside a hurricane.However, these are relatively small effects in comparison to the overall force onthe cylinder.) The aerodynamics of a tree, and especially that of a forest, are moresophisticated than discussed here. Indeed, the aerodynamics of trees have beenstudied experimentally with trees actually mounted in a wind tunnel. 6 3.19 HISTORICAL NOTE: BERNOULLI AND EULER—THE ORIGINS OF THEORETICAL FLUID DYNAMICS Bernoulli’s equation, expressed by Equations (3.14) and (3.15), is historically the most famous equation in ﬂuid dynamics. Moreover, we derived Bernoulli’sequation from the general momentum equation in partial differential equationform. The momentum equation is just one of the three fundamental equationsof ﬂuid dynamics—the others being continuity and energy. These equations arederived and discussed in Chapter 2 and applied to an incompressible ﬂow inthis chapter. Where did these equations ﬁrst originate? How old are they, andwho is responsible for them? Considering the fact that all of ﬂuid dynamics ingeneral, and aerodynamics in particular, is built on these fundamental equations,it is important to pause for a moment and examine their historical roots. As discussed in Section 1.1, Isaac Newton, in his Principia of 1687, was the ﬁrst to establish on a rational basis the relationships between force, momentum,and acceleration. Although he tried, he was unable to apply these concepts prop-erly to a moving ﬂuid. The real foundations of theoretical ﬂuid dynamics werenot laid until the next century—developed by a triumvirate consisting of DanielBernoulli, Leonhard Euler, and Jean Le Rond d’Alembert. 6For more details, see the interesting discussion on forest aerodynamics in the book by John E. Allen entitled Aerodynamics, The Science of Air in Motion, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1982.CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 303 Figure 3.51 Bernoulli’s family tree. First, consider Bernoulli. Actually, we must consider the whole family of Bernoulli’s because Daniel Bernoulli was a member of a prestigious family that dominated European mathematics and physics during the early part of the eigh-teenth century. Figure 3.51 is a portion of the Bernoulli family tree. It startswith Nikolaus Bernoulli, who was a successful merchant and druggist in Basel,Switzerland, during the seventeenth century. With one eye on this family tree,let us simply list some of the subsequent members of this highly accomplishedfamily: 1.Jakob—Daniel’s uncle. Mathematician and physicist, he was professor of mathematics at the University of Basel. He made major contributions to thedevelopment of calculus and coined the term “integral.” 2.Johann—Daniel’s father. He was a professor of mathematics at Groningen,Netherlands, and later at the University of Basel. He taught the famousFrench mathematician L’Hospital the elements of calculus, and after thedeath of Newton in 1727 he was considered Europe’s leadingmathematician at that time. 3.Nikolaus—Daniel’s cousin. He studied mathematics under his uncles andheld a master’s degree in mathematics and a doctor of jurisprudence. 4.Nikolaus—Daniel’s brother. He was Johann’s favorite son. He held a masterof arts degree, and assisted with much of Johann’s correspondence toNewton and Liebniz concerning the development of calculus. 5.Daniel himself—to be discussed below. 6.Johann—Daniel’s other brother. He succeeded his father in the Chair ofMathematics at Basel and won the prize of the Paris Academy four timesfor his work. 7.Johann—Daniel’s nephew. A gifted child, he earned the master ofjurisprudence at the age of 14. When he was 20, he was invited byFrederick II to reorganize the astronomical observatory at the BerlinAcademy.304 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 8.Jakob—Daniel’s other nephew. He graduated in jurisprudence but worked in mathematics and physics. He was appointed to the Academy inSt. Petersburg, Russia, but he had a promising career prematurely thatended when he drowned in the river Neva at the age of 30. With such a family pedigree, Daniel Bernoulli was destined for success. Daniel Bernoulli was born in Groningen, Netherlands, on February 8, 1700. His father, Johann, was a professor at Groningen but returned to Basel, Switzerland,in 1705 to occupy the Chair of Mathematics which had been vacated by the deathof Jacob Bernoulli. At the University of Basel, Daniel obtained a master’s de-gree in 1716 in philosophy and logic. He went on to study medicine in Basel,Heidelburg, and Strasbourg, obtaining his Ph.D. in anatomy and botany in 1721.During these studies, he maintained an active interest in mathematics. He followedthis interest by moving brieﬂy to Venice, where he published an important workentitled Exercitationes Mathematicae in 1724. This earned him much attention and resulted in his winning the prize awarded by the Paris Academy—the ﬁrst of10 he was eventually to receive. In 1725, Daniel moved to St. Petersburg, Russia,to join the academy. The St. Petersburg Academy had gained a substantial reputa-tion for scholarship and intellectual accomplishment at that time. During the next8 years, Bernoulli experienced his most creative period. While at St. Petersburg,he wrote his famous book Hydrodynamica, completed in 1734, but not published until 1738. In 1733, Daniel returned to Basel to occupy the Chair of Anatomy andBotany, and in 1750 moved to the Chair of Physics created exclusively for him.He continued to write, give very popular and well-attended lectures in physics,and make contributions to mathematics and physics until his death in Basel onMarch 17, 1782. Daniel Bernoulli was famous in his own time. He was a member of virtually all the existing learned societies and academies, such as Bologna, St. Petersburg,Berlin, Paris, London, Bern, Turin, Zurich, and Mannheim. His importance toﬂuid dynamics is centered on his book Hydrodynamica (1738). (With this book, Daniel introduced the term “hydrodynamics” to the literature.) In this book, heranged over such topics as jet propulsion, manometers, and ﬂow in pipes. Ofmost importance, he attempted to obtain a relationship between pressure andvelocity. Unfortunately, his derivation was somewhat obscure, and Bernoulli’sequation, ascribed by history to Daniel via his Hydrodynamica, is not to be found in this book, at least not in the form we see it today [such as Equations (3.14)and (3.15)]. The propriety of Equations (3.14) and (3.15) is further complicatedby his father, Johann, who also published a book in 1743 entitled Hydraulica. It is clear from this latter book that the father understood Bernoulli’s theorembetter than his son; Daniel thought of pressure strictly in terms of the height ofa manometer column, whereas Johann had the more fundamental understandingthat pressure was a force acting on the ﬂuid. (It is interesting to note that JohannBernoulli was a person of some sensitivity and irritability, with an overpoweringdrive for recognition. He tried to undercut the impact of Daniel’s HydrodynamicaCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 305 by predating the publication date of Hydraulica to 1728, to make it appear to have been the ﬁrst of the two. There was little love lost between son and father.) During Daniel Bernoulli’s most productive years, partial differential equa- tions had not yet been introduced into mathematics and physics; hence, he could not approach the derivation of Bernoulli’s equation in the same fashion as we havein Section 3.2. The introduction of partial differential equations to mathematicalphysics was due to d’Alembert in 1747. d’Alembert’s role in ﬂuid mechanics isdetailed in Section 3.20. Sufﬁce it to say here that his contributions were equally ifnot more important than Bernoulli’s, and d’Alembert represents the second mem-ber of the triumvirate which molded the foundations of theoretical ﬂuid dynamicsin the eighteenth century. The third and probably pivotal member of this triumvirate was Leonhard Euler. He was a giant among the eighteenth-century mathematicians and scientists.As a result of his contributions, his name is associated with numerous equationsand techniques, for example, the Euler numerical solution of ordinary differentialequations, eulerian angles in geometry, and the momentum equations for inviscidﬂuid ﬂow [see Equation (3.12)]. Leonhard Euler was born on April 15, 1707, in Basel, Switzerland. His father was a Protestant minister who enjoyed mathematics as a pastime. Therefore, Eulergrew up in a family atmosphere that encouraged intellectual activity. At the age of13, Euler entered the University of Basel which at that time had about 100 studentsand 19 professors. One of those professors was Johann Bernoulli, who tutoredEuler in mathematics. Three years later, Euler received his master’s degree inphilosophy. It is interesting that three of the people most responsible for the early devel- opment of theoretical ﬂuid dynamics—Johann and Daniel Bernoulli and Euler—lived in the same town of Basel, were associated with the same university, andwere contemporaries. Indeed, Euler and the Bernoullis were close and respectedfriends—so much that, when Daniel Bernoulli moved to teach and study at theSt. Petersburg Academy in 1725, he was able to convince the academy to hireEuler as well. At this invitation, Euler left Basel for Russia; he never returned toSwitzerland, although he remained a Swiss citizen throughout his life. Euler’s interaction with Daniel Bernoulli in the development of ﬂuid me- chanics grew strong during these years at St. Petersburg. It was here that Eulerconceived of pressure as a point property that can vary from point to point through-out a ﬂuid and obtained a differential equation relating pressure and velocity, thatis,Euler’s equation given by Equation (3.12). In turn, Euler integrated the differ- ential equation to obtain, for the ﬁrst time in history, Bernoulli’s equation in theform of Equations (3.14) and (3.15). Hence, we see that Bernoulli’s equation isreally a misnomer; credit for it is legitimately shared by Euler. When Daniel Bernoulli returned to Basel in 1733, Euler succeeded him at St. Petersburg as a professor of physics. Euler was a dynamic and proliﬁc man; by1741 he had prepared 90 papers for publication and written the two-volume bookMechanica. The atmosphere surrounding St. Petersburg was conducive to such306 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow achievement. Euler wrote in 1749: “I and all others who had the good fortune to be for some time with the Russian Imperial Academy cannot but acknowledgethat we owe everything which we are and possess to the favorable conditionswhich we had there.” However, in 1740, political unrest in St. Petersburg caused Euler to leave for the Berlin Society of Sciences, at that time just formed by Frederick theGreat. Euler lived in Berlin for the next 25 years, where he transformed thesociety into a major academy. In Berlin, Euler continued his dynamic mode ofworking, preparing at least 380 papers for publication. Here, as a competitorwith d’Alembert (see Section 3.20), Euler formulated the basis for mathematicalphysics. In 1766, after a major disagreement with Frederick the Great over some ﬁnancial aspects of the academy, Euler moved back to St. Petersburg. This secondperiod of his life in Russia became one of physical suffering. In that same year,he became blind in one eye after a short illness. An operation in 1771 resulted inrestoration of his sight, but only for a few days. He did not take proper precautionsafter the operation, and within a few days, he was completely blind. However,with the help of others, he continued his work. His mind was sharp as ever, andhis spirit did not diminish. His literary output even increased—about half of histotal papers were written after 1765! On September 18, 1783, Euler conducted business as usual—giving a mathe- matics lesson, making calculations of the motion of balloons, and discussing withfriends the planet of Uranus, which had recently been discovered. At about 5 P.M., he suffered a brain hemorrhage. His only words before losing consciousness were“I am dying.” By 11 P.M., one of the greatest minds in history had ceased to exist. With the lives of Bernoulli, Euler, and d’Alembert (see Section 3.20) as back- ground, let us now trace the geneology of the basic equations of ﬂuid dynamics.For example, consider the continuity equation in the form of Equation (2.52). Al-though Newton had postulated the obvious fact that the mass of a speciﬁed objectwas constant, this principle was not appropriately applied to ﬂuid mechanics until1749. In this year, d’Alembert gave a paper in Paris, entitled “Essai d’une nouvelletheorie de la resistance des ﬂuides,” in which he formulated differential equationsfor the conservation of mass in special applications to plane and axisymmetricﬂows. Euler took d’Alembert’s results and, 8 years later, generalized them in aseries of three basic papers on ﬂuid mechanics. In these papers, Euler published,for the ﬁrst time in history, the continuity equation in the form of Equation (2.52)and the momentum equations in the form of Equations (2.113a andc), without the viscous terms. Hence, two of the three basic conservation equations used to-day in modern ﬂuid dynamics were well established long before the AmericanRevolutionary War—such equations were contemporary with the time of GeorgeWashington and Thomas Jefferson! The origin of the energy equation in the form of Equation (2.96) without viscous terms has its roots in the development of thermodynamics in the nineteenthcentury. Its precise ﬁrst use is obscure and is buried somewhere in the rapiddevelopment of physical science in the nineteenth century.CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 307 The purpose of this section has been to give you some feeling for the historical development of the fundamental equations of ﬂuid dynamics. Maybe we can appreciate these equations more when we recognize that they have been with usfor quite some time and that they are the product of much thought from some ofthe greatest minds of the eighteenth century. 3.20 HISTORICAL NOTE: D’ALEMBERT AND HIS PARADOX You can well imagine the frustration that Jean le Rond d’Alembert felt in 1744when, in a paper entitled “Traite de l’equilibre et des mouvements de ﬂuids pourservir de suite au traite de dynamique,” he obtained the result of zero drag for theinviscid, incompressible ﬂow over a closed two-dimensional body. Using differentapproaches, d’Alembert encountered this result again in 1752 in his paper entitled“Essai sur la resistance” and again in 1768 in his “Opuscules mathematiques.”In this last paper can be found the quote given at the beginning of Chapter 15;in essence, he had given up trying to explain the cause of this paradox. Eventhough the prediction of ﬂuid-dynamic drag was a very important problem ind’Alembert’s time, and in spite of the number of great minds that addressedit, the fact that viscosity is responsible for drag was not appreciated. Instead,d’Alembert’s analyses used momentum principles in a frictionless ﬂow, and quitenaturally he found that the ﬂow ﬁeld closed smoothly around the downstreamportion of the bodies, resulting in zero drag. Who was this man, d’Alembert?Considering the role his paradox played in the development of ﬂuid dynamics, itis worth our time to take a closer look at the man himself. d’Alembert was born illegitimately in Paris on November 17, 1717. His mother was Madame De Tenun, a famous salon hostess of that time, and hisfather was Chevalier Destouches-Canon, a cavalry ofﬁcer. d’Alembert was im-mediately abandoned by his mother (she was an ex-nun who was afraid of beingforcibly returned to the convent). However, his father quickly arranged for a homefor d’Alembert—with a family of modest means named Rousseau. d’Alembertlived with this family for the next 47 years. Under the support of his father,d’Alembert was educated at the College de Quatre-Nations, where he studiedlaw and medicine, and later turned to mathematics. For the remainder of his life,d’Alembert would consider himself a mathematician. By a program of self-study,d’Alembert learned the works of Newton and the Bernoullis. His early mathemat-ics caught the attention of the Paris Academy of Sciences, of which he became amember in 1741. d’Alembert published frequently and sometimes rather hastily,in order to be in print before his competition. However, he made substantial con-tributions to the science of his time. For example, he was (1) the ﬁrst to formulatethe wave equation of classical physics, (2) the ﬁrst to express the concept of apartial differential equation, (3) the ﬁrst to solve a partial differential equation—heused separation of variables—and (4) the ﬁrst to express the differential equa-tions of ﬂuid dynamics in terms of a ﬁeld. His contemporary, Leonhard Euler308 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow (see Sections 1.1 and 3.18) later expanded greatly on these equations and was responsible for developing them into a truly rational approach for ﬂuid-dynamicanalysis. During the course of his life, d’Alembert became interested in many scien- tiﬁc and mathematical subjects, including vibrations, wave motion, and celestialmechanics. In the 1750s, he had the honored position of science editor for theEncyclopedia—a major French intellectual endeavor of the eighteenth centurywhich attempted to compile all existing knowledge into a large series of books.As he grew older, he also wrote papers on nonscientiﬁc subjects, mainly musicalstructure, law, and religion. In 1765, d’Alembert became very ill. He was helped to recover by the nurs- ing of Mlle. Julie de Lespinasse, the woman who was d’Alembert’s only lovethroughout his life. Although he never married, d’Alembert lived with Julie deLespinasse until she died in 1776. d’Alembert had always been a charming gen-tleman, renowned for his intelligence, gaiety, and considerable conversationalability. However, after Mlle. de Lespinasse’s death, he became frustrated andmorose—living a life of despair. He died in this condition on October 29, 1783,in Paris. d’Alembert was one of the great mathematicians and physicists of the eigh- teenth century. He maintained active communications and dialogue with bothBernoulli and Euler and ranks with them as one of the founders of modern ﬂuiddynamics. This, then, is the man behind the paradox, which has existed as anintegral part of ﬂuid dynamics for the past two centuries. 3.21 SUMMARY Return to the road map given in Figure 3.4. Examine each block of the road map toremind yourself of the route we have taken in this discussion of the fundamentalsof inviscid, incompressible ﬂow.

However, total pressure is more signiﬁcant than just the pressure that exists at a stagnation pointon a body. It is, by general deﬁnition, the pressure that would exist at any pointin a ﬂow if the ﬂow velocity were somehow magically slowed to zero velocityat that point without the inﬂuence of the dissipative effects of friction or thermalconduction. A more complete examination of the deﬁnition of total pressure isdiscussed in Section 7.5 dealing with the general case of a compressible ﬂow.For our purposes here, we will continue our treatment of an incompressible ﬂow,where from Equation (3.35), the total pressure, p 0, is given by p0=p1+1 2ρV2 This relation stems from Bernoulli’s equation, and hence applies to an incom-pressible ﬂow with no friction. Note, however, that the “no friction” criterionapplies only to that part of the ﬂow associated with the slowing-down processfrom the local ﬂow velocity to zero. As discussed in Section 3.4, this slowing-down process can be real, as occurs when the ﬂow comes to a stop at the entranceof a Pitot tube or at a stagnation point on a body. Or, the slowing-down process312 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow can be imaginary, where at any given point in a ﬂow we imagine the ﬂow slowed to zero velocity at that point, and then the pressure that would exist at that point, is by deﬁnition the total pressure at that point. For example, consider two points in a ﬂow, points 1 and 2, where the static pressure and ﬂow velocity are p1,V1,p2, andV2, respectively. At point 1, p01=p1+1 2ρV2 1 and at point 2, p02=p2+1 2ρV2 1 In general, at these two points, due to dissipative effects in the ﬂow, the totalpressure will not be the same, i.e., p 01/negationslash=p02. Only in the case of ﬂows without internal dissipation, i.e., without external friction or thermal conduction, will thetotal pressure be the same. Of course, in this chapter we are dealing with a fric-tionless ﬂow, so for all the ﬂows considered here, assuming a uniform freestreamahead of the body or entering a wind tunnel, the total pressure is constant through-out the ﬂow. Total pressure is a measure of the ability of a ﬂow to do some kind of “useful work.” When there is the loss of total pressure, the ﬂow loses some of its ca- pacity to do useful work. For example, in the ﬂow through a jet engine, a lossof total pressure causes a net loss of engine thrust. In the external ﬂow over anaerodynamic body, the drag on that body causes a net loss of total pressure in theﬂow. It is precisely this effect that is the subject of the present Integrated WorkChallenge. Challenge: Examine and derive a relation between the aerodynamic drag on a body and the loss of total pressure in the ﬂow ﬁeld. Solution: Consider the control volume sketched in Figure 2.20 a. Here, the drag per unit span on a body inside the control volume is related to the loss of momen- tum in the ﬂow, and the relation is given by a combination of Equations (2.78)and (2.79) as D /prime=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·ds)u=/integraldisplaya iρ1u2 1dy−/integraldisplayb hρ2u22dy (C3.1) Along station i−a, p01=p1+1 2ρu21 where p1andu1are constant over the station, and u1is the freestream velocity V∞ahead of the body. Thus, p01=p1+1 2ρV2 ∞ (C3.2)CHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 313 Along station h−b, p02=p2+1 2ρu2 2 (C3.3) where p2is constant over the station but u2is a variable in the downstream wake of the body. The total pressure integrated over the inﬂow station is /integraldisplaya ip01dy=/integraldisplaya i/parenleftbigg p1+1 2ρV2 ∞/parenrightbigg dy and the total pressure integrated over the outﬂow station is /integraldisplayb hp01dy=/integraldisplayb h/parenleftbigg p2+1 2ρu22/parenrightbigg dy The net integrated lossof total pressure between the inﬂow and outﬂow stations is the difference between the two integrals. Denoting the net integrated loss of total pressure by IL, we have IL=/integraldisplaya i/parenleftbigg p1+1 2ρV2 ∞/parenrightbigg dy−/integraldisplayb h/parenleftbigg p2+1 2ρu2 2/parenrightbigg dy (C3.4) The static pressure across stations aiandhbis constant and equal to p∞. Also, consider the streamlines forming the upper and lower boundaries of the control volume in Figure 2.20 ato be far enough apart to be essentially straight, parallel streamlines; thus the distances iaandhbare the same. Hence, in Equation (3.4), the terms involving the static pressure become /integraldisplaya ip1dy−/integraldisplayb hp2dy=/integraldisplaya ip∞dy−/integraldisplaya ip∞dy=0 and Equation (3.4) reduces to IL=/integraldisplaya i/parenleftbigg1 2ρV2 ∞−1 2ρu2 2/parenrightbigg dy (C3.5) or, since ρis constant IL=1 2ρ/integraldisplaya i/parenleftbigV2 ∞−u22/parenrightbigdy (C3.6) However, from Equation (C3.1), ρ/integraldisplaya i/parenleftbigV2 ∞−u22/parenrightbigdy=D/prime(C3.7) Comparing Equations (C3.6) and (C3.7), we have IL=1 2D/prime(C3.8)314 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow That is, there is a net loss of total pressure per unit depth from the inﬂow to the outﬂow boundaries, and this integrated loss of total pressure is equal to one-halfof the aerodynamic drag per unit span exerted on the body immersed in the ﬂow. So we see that there is a connection between drag and the loss of total pressure. Total pressure is a measure of the capacity of the ﬂow to do useful work. Drag isa force opposing the forward motion of a body; drag is a mechanism that createsa kind of “negative work” that must be countered by an increase in the positivework to move the body. In the ﬂow over a body, drag serves to reduce the localﬂow ﬁeld velocity, which is reﬂected in a reduction of total pressure. 3.23 INTEGRATED WORK CHALLENGE: CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF A SUBSONIC WIND TUNNEL Concept: The aerodynamic ﬂow in the test section of a low-speed subsonic wind tunnel is discussed in Section 3.3. Two basic conﬁgurations for such wind tunnels are sketched in Figures 3.8 aand 3.8b , an open-circuit tunnel and a closed- circuit tunnel, respectively. These wind tunnels are aerodynamic devices, in thesame spirit that an airplane is an aerodynamic device. And like an airplane that ispowered by some type of motor, so is a wind tunnel powered by a motor, as shownin Figure 3.8. The conceptual design of an airplane starts with the speciﬁcation ofthe requirements to be met by the airplane, and a preliminary calculation of thepower required to meet these speciﬁcations is an essential part of the conceptualdesign process. (See Anderson, Aircraft Performance and Design, 1999, McGraw- Hill, Chapter 7.) Similarly, the conceptual design of a wind tunnel starts with aspeciﬁcation for the aerodynamic ﬂow in the test section, and the power requiredto drive the wind tunnel ﬂow to meet the speciﬁed conditions is an essential partof the conceptual design process of the tunnel. The purpose of this IntegratedWork Challenge is to illustrate this design process. Challenge: Consider that you have been given the job of designing a new subsonic wind tunnel. The speciﬁcations call for a maximum test-section ﬂow velocity of 120 m/s and a test section size that can accommodate an airplane model with awing span of 2 m. The Reynolds number capability in the ﬂow direction must be25 million. The speciﬁcations also require a closed-circuit wind tunnel becauseit takes less power to run such a tunnel compared with an open circuit for thesame test section conditions. Of course, just a glance at Figure 3.8 indicates thata closed-circuit tunnel requires a great deal more laboratory space than an open-circuit tunnel, but for the present design we assume there are no space limitations.Your challenge is to prepare a conceptual design for the new wind tunnel, andin particular to estimate the power required to drive the ﬂow around the tunnelcircuit. Solution: Step one is to determine the size of the test section. We choose a rectangular shape for the test section, and we need to determine the width andCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 315 height of the cross section perpendicular to the ﬂow and the length of the test section in the ﬂow direction. For the most part, there is no precise technicalcalculation for the test section; indeed, there are no “right” dimensions to be had,just like there is no one “right” shape for a new airplane. There are a multitudeof viable shapes and sizes. When a designer chooses a size and shape, he or sheis guided by existing designs that have been proven to work. For our IntegratedWork Challenge, we will examine previous wind tunnel designs and make somedecisions based on these designs. An excellent source of such design informationis Barlow, Rae, and Pope, Low-Speed Wind Tunnel Testing, Third Edition, 1999, John Wiley and Sons, New York. Our speciﬁcations call for a test section with awidth large enough such that an airplane model with a 2-meter wingspan wouldcomfortably ﬁt. Barlow et al. recommend that the maximum wing span of a modelbe less than 0.8 of the tunnel width in order to minimize the effects of the tunnelwalls on the aerodynamic measurements. Let us design our test section widthsuch that the model wingspan will be about 0.7 of the tunnel width. Thus, Width =2m 0.7=2.86 m For convenience during the fabrication of the tunnel, we will round the widthto the whole number of 3 m. Barlow et al. also suggest that for testing airplanemodels, a rectangular test section with a width-to-height ratio of about 1.5 willminimize the wall correction factor on the measured data. Thus, we choose theheight of the test section to be Height =width 1.5=3m 1.5=2m So our tunnel will have a 2 ×3-m test section. Parenthetically, we note (see Barlow et al., p. 102) that the subsonic wind tunnel established years ago by Boeing atthe University of Washington has a rectangular test section that is 8 ×12 ft, the same 2 to 3 ratio chosen for our design. Our test section must be long enough to provide the maximum speciﬁed test Reynolds number of 25 million (25 ×10 6). To achieve this Reynolds number, recalling that the speciﬁed ﬂow velocity in the test section is 120 m/s, notingthat the test-section ﬂow temperature and density correspond to standard sealevel conditions (see Appendix D) of T ∞=288.16 K and ρ∞=1.225 kg/m3, and the viscosity coefﬁcient at this temperature is 1.7894 ×10−5kg/(m)(s) from Section 1.11, the required test section length /lscriptis obtained from: Re=ρ∞V∞/lscript μ∞=25×106 or, /lscript=μ∞Re ρ∞V∞=(1.7894 ×10−5)(25×106) (1.225)(120) /lscript=3.046 m316 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Again we will be conservative and choose the test section length to be slightly longer, namely 3.2 m. So the overall size of our rectangular-shaped text sectionwill be Height:width:length =2m×3m×3.2m Caution: An airplane that is designed larger than it needs to be will have a larger weight and more surface area that generates more drag than necessary, hencerequiring engines with more power than they need. Similarly, a wind tunnel witha test section that is larger than it needs to be will require more mass ﬂow ofair, and the wetted surface area of the walls being more than it needs to be willgenerate a larger friction loss than necessary, both requiring more motor power todrive the wind tunnel than necessary. Hence, in our determination of the size ofthe test section for our wind tunnel, we have been a little conservative to ensurethe generation of a proper ﬂow for accurate aerodynamic measurements, but wemust be careful not to be too conservative. Step two of our conceptual design is an estimate of the power required to drive the wind tunnel. For this, we ﬁrst calculate the energy of the ﬂow in the testsection. The kinetic energy per unit mass of gas in the test section, where V tis the ﬂow velocity in the test section, is1 2V2 t. The mass ﬂow of air through the test section with cross-sectional Atis˙mt=ρtAtVt. The jet power in the test section, Pt, is the time rate of ﬂow of energy through the test section, given by Pt=(mass ﬂow)(kinetic energy per unit mass) =(ρtAtVt)/parenleftbigg1 2V2 t/parenrightbigg or, Pt=1 2ρtAtV3 t (C3.9) The function of the motor in a closed-return wind tunnel is to provide power toﬁrst get the air moving through the tunnel, but after the ﬂow is up to speed, thenthe motor power is required to overcome losses in the ﬂow as it moves aroundthe tunnel circuit. If there were no losses, no motor power would be required,and the tunnel would be a perpetual motion machine. Nature ensures that thisdoes not happen, so our next conceptual design step is to estimate the losses asthe air ﬂows around the tunnel circuit. Referring to our discussion in Section 3.22 of the connection between drag on an aerodynamic body and the loss of total pressure in the ﬂow around thatbody, in a similar fashion the loss in any section of the wind tunnel is deﬁned asthe mean loss of total pressure of the air ﬂow as it passes through that section.The total pressure is p 0=p+1 2ρV2(C3.10) and for the external ﬂow over an aerodynamic body, the loss in p0is due to the loss of velocity and hence loss of dynamic pressure1 2ρV2in Equation (C3.10). How- ever, for the internal ﬂow through a wind tunnel, the principle of mass conservationCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 317 applied at any particular section of the tunnel dictates that there can be no loss of velocity due to dissipative effects. From the continuity equation for an incom-pressible ﬂow, Equation (9.22), we have AV=constant and since Ais ﬁxed by the wind tunnel design, any change in velocity between two locations in the tunnel is simply due to the area change between these twosections. Nevertheless, dissipation occurs in the ﬂow (friction due to the ﬂowalong the tunnel walls, etc.), and this loss does show up as a loss of total pressure.However, referring to Equation (C3.10), this loss appears as a decrease in thestatic pressure, p, compared with what the static pressure would be if there were no dissipative losses. In Equation (C3.10), p 0andpare frequently referred to as the “total head” and “static head,” respectively. As stated by Barlow et al. (p. 73): “There will be equal drops in static head and in total head corresponding to the friction loss. Throughout the wind tunnel the losses that occur appear as successive pressuredrops to be balanced by the pressure rise through the fan. The total pressure drop willbe the pressure rise required by the fan.” As shown in Figure 3.8, the fan is connected to the motor and is the mechanism that supplies energy to the air ﬂow, analogous to the propeller on an airplane thatconverts engine power to thrust power to propel the airplane. In order to estimate the power required to drive the wind tunnel, referring to Figure 3.8, we should estimate the total pressure drop in each section of the windtunnel, such as the nozzle, test section, diffuser, turning vanes in the corners, etc.Let us denote the rate of ﬂow losses in the complete circuit as P c. Deﬁning the energy ratio, ER, as ER=Pt Pc(C3.11) we could estimate the energy ratio that pertains to each tunnel section. There areengineering methods for making such estimates, as nicely detailed in Barlow etal. For our purposes, however, we will make an estimate of the value of E Rfor the complete wind tunnel by looking at values from existing wind tunnels. Froma tabulation in Barlow et al. (p. 102), the wind tunnel closest in size to our designis the University of Washington 8 ×12 foot tunnel with an energy ratio of 8.3. This is the highest value of any of the tunnels listed in the tabulation and reﬂectsa highly efﬁcient design for the university’s tunnel. Using this energy ratio forour conceptual design, we have from Equation (C3.11) P c=Pt ER(C3.12) where the jet power in our 2 ×3-m test section is obtained from Equation (C3.9) Pt=1 2ρtAtV3 t =1 2(1.23)(2)(3)(120)3=6.376×106W318 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow From Equation (C3.9), Pc=Pt ER=6.376×106 8.3=7.682×106W Noting that 746 W =1 hp, the rate of ﬂow losses in the wind tunnel is Pc=7.682×105 746=1030 hp This is the power that the fan must supply to the ﬂow. Assuming no losses from the motor to the fan and then to the ﬂow (i.e., 100% motor and fan efﬁciency),the motor must supply 1030 hp to drive the wind tunnel. To summarize the basic conceptual design of our subsonic wind tunnel: Tunnel circuit: Closed return, such as in Figure 3.8b Size of test section: 2 m ×3m×3.2m Flow velocity in the test section: 120 m/sMotor power required: 1030 hp 3.24 PROBLEMS Note: All the following problems assume an inviscid, incompressible ﬂow. Also, standard sea level density and pressure are 1.23 kg/m3(0.002377 slug/ft3) and 1.01×105N/m2(2116 lb/ft2), respectively. 3.1For an irrotational ﬂow, show that Bernoulli’s equation holds between any points in the ﬂow, not just along a streamline. 3.2Consider a venturi with a throat-to-inlet area ratio of 0.8, mounted on the side of an airplane fuselage. The airplane is in ﬂight at standard sea level.If the static pressure at the throat is 2100 lb/ft 2, calculate the velocity of the airplane. 3.3Consider a venturi with a small hole drilled in the side of the throat. Thishole is connected via a tube to a closed reservoir. The purpose of theventuri is to create a vacuum in the reservoir when the venturi is placed inan airstream. (The vacuum is deﬁned as the pressure difference below the outside ambient pressure.) The venturi has a throat-to-inlet area ratio of0.85. Calculate the maximum vacuum obtainable in the reservoir when theventuri is placed in an airstream of 90 m/s at standard sea level conditions. 3.4Consider a low-speed open-circuit subsonic wind tunnel with aninlet-to-throat area ratio of 12. The tunnel is turned on, and the pressuredifference between the inlet (the settling chamber) and the test section isread as a height difference of 10 cm on a U-tube mercury manometer.(The density of liquid mercury is 1.36 ×10 4kg/m3.) Calculate the velocity of the air in the test section. 3.5Assume that a Pitot tube is inserted into the test-section ﬂow of the windtunnel in Problem 3.4. The tunnel test section is completely sealed fromCHAPTER 3Fundamentals of Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 319 the outside ambient pressure. Calculate the pressure measured by the Pitot tube, assuming the static pressure at the tunnel inlet is atmospheric. 3.6A Pitot tube on an airplane ﬂying at standard sea level reads 1.07×10 5N/m2. What is the velocity of the airplane? 3.7At a given point on the surface of the wing of the airplane in Problem 3.6,the ﬂow velocity is 130 m/s. Calculate the pressure coefﬁcient at this point. 3.8Consider a uniform ﬂow with velocity V ∞. Show that this ﬂow is a physically possible incompressible ﬂow and that it is irrotational. 3.9Show that a source ﬂow is a physically possible incompressible ﬂoweverywhere except at the origin. Also show that it is irrotationaleverywhere. 3.10 Prove that the velocity potential and the stream function for a uniformﬂow, Equations (3.53) and (3.55), respectively, satisfy Laplace’s equation. 3.11 Prove that the velocity potential and the stream function for a source ﬂow,Equations (3.67) and (3.72), respectively, satisfy Laplace’s equation. 3.12 Consider the ﬂow over a semi-inﬁnite body as discussed in Section 3.11. If V ∞is the velocity of the uniform stream, and the stagnation point is 1 ft upstream of the source: a. Draw the resulting semi-inﬁnite body to scale on graph paper. b. Plot the pressure coefﬁcient distribution over the body; that is, plot Cp versus distance along the centerline of the body. 3.13 Derive Equation (3.81). Hint: Make use of the symmetry of the ﬂow ﬁeld shown in Figure 3.18; that is, start with the knowledge that the stagnationpoints must lie on the axis aligned with the direction of V ∞. 3.14 Derive the velocity potential for a doublet; that is, derive Equation (3.88).Hint: The easiest method is to start with Equation (3.87) for the stream function and extract the velocity potential. 3.15 Consider the nonlifting ﬂow over a circular cylinder. Derive an expressionfor the pressure coefﬁcient at an arbitrary point (r,θ)in this ﬂow, and show that it reduces to Equation (3.101) on the surface of the cylinder. 3.16 Consider the nonlifting ﬂow over a circular cylinder of a given radius,where V ∞=20 ft/s. If V∞is doubled, that is, V∞=40 ft/s, does the shape of the streamlines change? Explain. 3.17 Consider the lifting ﬂow over a circular cylinder of a given radius and witha given circulation. If V ∞is doubled, keeping the circulation the same, does the shape of the streamlines change? Explain. 3.18 The lift on a spinning circular cylinder in a freestream with a velocity of30 m/s and at standard sea level conditions is 6 N/m of span. Calculate thecirculation around the cylinder. 3.19 A typical World War I biplane ﬁghter (such as the French SPAD shown inFigure 3.50) has a number of vertical interwing struts and diagonalbracing wires. Assume for a given airplane that the total length for the320 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow vertical struts (summed together) is 25 ft, and that the struts are cylindrical with a diameter of 2 in. Assume also that the total length of the bracingwires is 80 ft, with a cylindrical diameter of 3 32in. Calculate the drag (in pounds) contributed by these struts and bracing wires when the airplane isﬂying at 120 mi/h at standard sea level. Compare this component of dragwith the total zero-lift drag for the airplane, for which the total wing areais 230 ft 2and the zero-lift drag coefﬁcient is 0.036. 3.20 The Kutta-Joukowski theorem, Equation (3.140), was derived exactlyfor the case of the lifting cylinder. In Section 3.16 it is stated withoutproof that Equation (3.140) also applies in general to a two-dimensionalbody of arbitrary shape. Although this general result can be provenmathematically, it also can be accepted by making a physical argument aswell. Make this physical argument by drawing a closed curve around thebody where the closed curve is very far away from the body, so far awaythat in perspective the body becomes a very small speck in the middle ofthe domain enclosed by the closed curve. 3.21 Consider the streamlines over a circular cylinder as sketched at the right ofFigure 3.26. Single out the ﬁrst three streamlines ﬂowing over the top ofthe cylinder. Designate each streamline by its stream function, ψ 1,ψ2, and ψ3. The ﬁrst streamline wets the surface of the cylinder; designate ψ1=0. The streamline above that is ψ2, and the next one above that is ψ3. Assume the streamlines start out in the freestream equally spaced. Hence,the volume ﬂow rates between the streamlines are the same. Thestreamline ψ 2passes through the point (1.2 R,π/2) directly above the top of the cylinder. Calculate the location of the point directly above the top ofthe cylinder through which the streamline ψ 3ﬂows. Comment on the spacing between the streamlines directly above the top. 3.22 Consider the ﬂow ﬁeld over a circular cylinder mounted perpendicular tothe ﬂow in the test section of a low-speed subsonic wind tunnel. Atstandard sea level conditions, if the ﬂow velocity at some region of theﬂow ﬁeld exceeds about 250 mi/h, compressibility begins to have an effectin that region. Calculate the velocity of the ﬂow in the test section of thewind tunnel above which compressibility effects begin to becomeimportant, i.e., above which we cannot accurately assume totallyincompressible ﬂow over the cylinder for the wind tunnel tests. 3.23 Prove that the ﬂow ﬁeld speciﬁed in Example 2.1 is not incompressible;i.e., it is a compressible ﬂow as stated without proof in Example 2.1.CHAPTER 4 Incompressible Flow over Airfoils Of the many problems now engaging attention, the following are considered of immediate importance and will be considered by the committee as rapidly asfunds can be secured for the purpose.... The evolution of more efﬁcient wingsections of practical form, embodying suitable dimensions for an economicalstructure, with moderate travel of the center-of-pressure and still affordinga large range of angle-of-attack combined with efﬁcient action. From the ﬁrst Annual Report of theNACA, 1915 PREVIEW BOX Imagine that you have just been given an airfoil of a particular shape at a certain angle of attack to a givenlow-speed ﬂow, and you have been asked to obtainthe lift (or more importantly, the lift coefﬁcient) ofthe airfoil. What do you do (besides panicking)? Yourﬁrst inclination might be to make a model of the air-foil, put it in a low-speed wind tunnel, and measurethe lift coefﬁcient. This is indeed what aerodynami-cists have been doing for more than 100 years. Theearly part of this chapter discusses such experimentalmeasurements of airfoil properties in low-speed windtunnels. These measurements give you an immediatefeel for airfoil lift, drag, and moment coefﬁcients asa function of angle of attack. The experimental mea-surements give you a fast track toward obtaining acomfortable and practical understanding as to howairfoils behave. That is what the ﬁrst three sections ofthis chapter are all about. Most of the rest of this chapter, however, deals with our second inclination as to how to obtain theairfoil properties, namely, to calculate them. This is a horse of a different color. You will be introducedto the elegant circulation theory of lift—the crowningjewel of inviscid, incompressible ﬂow theory for thecalculation of lift. At the turn of the twentieth cen-tury, the circulation theory of lift was a breakthrough 321322 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow in the theoretical prediction of lift. In this chapter, we ﬁrst apply this theory to thin airfoils at small angles ofattack; thin airfoil theory was developed in Germanyduring World War I and is by far the most tractablemeans of obtaining analytical solutions for lift andmoments on an airfoil. But, as we shall see, thin air-foil theory, as its name implies, holds only for thinairfoils at small angles of attack. This is not as restric-tive as it seems, however, because many airplanes overthe past years have relatively thin airfoils, and cruiseat relatively small angles of attack. Thin airfoil theorygives us a lot of practical results, plus the intellectualgratiﬁcation of carrying through some elegant theo-retical thinking—give it a good read and I think youwill like it. Since the 1960s, the advent and development of the high-speed digital computer allowed detailed nu-merical solutions based on the circulation theory oflift, solutions for the lift on a body of arbitrary shapeand thickness at any angle of attack, subject of courseto the assumption of inviscid potential ﬂow. Thesenumerical solutions, an extension of the panel so-lutions discussed in Section 3.17, are discussed to-ward the end of this chapter—they are the “goldstandard” for low-speed, inviscid-ﬂow airfoil calcu-lations, and are used throughout the aeronautical in-dustry and by many aeronautical research and devel-opment laboratories. The concept of panel solutionsis an inspired numerical application of the circulationtheory of lift, and it has opened the door to the anal-ysis of practically any airfoil shape at any angle ofattack. Airfoils come in many different shapes. An his- torical sequence of airfoil shapes through 1935 isshown in Figure 4.1. Beginning in 1938, the NationalAdvisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) devel-oped a revolutionary series of airfoil shapes designedto encourage laminar ﬂow in the boundary layer overthe airfoil, hence dramatically reducing skin fric-tion drag on the airfoil; the shape of a representativelaminar-ﬂow airfoil is given in Figure 4.2. Althoughthese shapes never produced the desired amount oflaminar ﬂow in practice, by a stroke of serendipitythey proved to be excellent high-speed airfoils for jet-powered airplanes after 1945.

Classic airfoil shapesfor supersonic ﬂow are shown in Figure 4.4; notethe very slender proﬁles with sharp leading edges.All the airfoil shapes shown in Figure 4.1 through4.4 were designed for speciﬁc purposes in their timeand have been used on untold numbers of differentairplanes. Today, the proper design of new airfoilshapes is more important than ever. Using numericaltechniques, aircraft companies usually custom-designthe airfoil shapes for new airplanes, shapes that bestﬁt the design requirements for the speciﬁc airplane.This chapter is exclusively devoted to the study ofairfoils; it discusses the fundamental aspects of airfoilaerodynamics—aspects that are the heart of airfoil de-sign and performance. Figure 4.5 shows an airplane in ﬂight, sustained in the air by the aerodynamic action of its wing. Air-plane wings are made up of airfoil shapes. The ﬁrststep in understanding the aerodynamics of wings isto understand the aerodynamics of airfoils. Airfoilaerodynamics is important stuff—it is the stuff of thischapter. Moreover, it is truly interesting. It is fun tovisualize the ﬂow over an airfoil and to learn how tocalculate the resulting lift on the airfoil. Read on andenjoy. Figure 4.5 DeHaviland DHC-6 Twin Otter (c/circlecopyrtPhotodisc/Alamy). 4.1 INTRODUCTION With the advent of successful powered ﬂight at the turn of the twentieth century, the importance of aerodynamics ballooned almost overnight. In turn, interestgrew in the understanding of the aerodynamic action of such lifting surfaces asﬁxed wings on airplanes and, later, rotors on helicopters. In the period 1912–1918, the analysis of airplane wings took a giant step forward when LudwigPrandtl and his colleagues at G¨ ottingen, Germany, showed that the aerodynamicconsideration of wings could be split into two parts: (1) the study of the324 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow section of a wing—an airfoil—and (2) the modiﬁcation of such airfoil prop- erties to account for the complete, ﬁnite wing. This approach is still used today; indeed, the theoretical calculation and experimental measurement of modern air-foil properties have been a major part of the aeronautics research carried out bythe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the 1970s and1980s. (See Chapter 5 of Reference 2 for an historical sketch on airfoil develop-ment and Reference 10 for a description of modern airfoil research.) FollowingPrandtl’s philosophy, the present chapter deals exclusively with airfoils, whereasChapter 5 treats the case of a complete, ﬁnite wing. Therefore, in this chap-ter and Chapter 5, we make a major excursion into aerodynamics as applied toairplanes. What is an airfoil? Consider a wing as drawn in perspective in Figure 4.6. The wing extends in the ydirection (the span direction). The freestream velocity V ∞is parallel to the xzplane. Any section of the wing cut by a plane parallel to the xzplane is called an airfoil. The purpose of this chapter is to present theoretical methods for the calculation of airfoil properties. In most of this chapter we willdeal with inviscid ﬂow, which does not lead to predictions of airfoil drag; indeed,d’Alembert’s paradox says that the drag on an airfoil is zero—clearly not a realisticanswer. We will have to wait until Section 4.12 and Chapter 15 and a discussionof viscous ﬂow before predictions of drag can be made. However, the lift andmoments on the airfoil are due mainly to the pressure distribution, which (belowthe stall) is dictated by inviscid ﬂow. Therefore, this chapter concentrates on thetheoretical prediction of airfoil lift and moments. The road map for this chapter is given in Figure 4.7. After some initial discussion on airfoil nomenclature and characteristics, we present two app-roaches to low-speed airfoil theory. One is the classical thin airfoil theory dev-eloped during the period 1910–1920 (the right-hand branch of Figure 4.7). Theother is the modern numerical approach for arbitrary airfoils using vortex panels Figure 4.6 Deﬁnition of an airfoil.CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 325 Incompressible flow over airfoils A rational approachto specifyingairfoil shapesAirfoilnomenclature Airfoil characteristics Singularitydistribution alongthe camber lineor the chord lineSingularitydistributionover theairfoil surface Kutta condition Kelvin’s theorem and the startingvortex Airfoils ofarbitrary shapeand thickness:vortex panelnumerical method Symmetric airfoil Cambered airfoilClassical thinairfoil theory Airfoil dragPhilosophy oflow-speedairfoil theory:vortex sheetExperimental data Figure 4.7 Road map for Chapter 4.326 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow (the left-hand branch of Figure 4.7).

Phillips in 1884.Phillips was an Englishman who carried out the ﬁrst serious wind-tunnel experi-ments on airfoils. In 1902, the Wright brothers conducted their own airfoil testsin a wind tunnel, developing relatively efﬁcient shapes which contributed to theirsuccessful ﬁrst ﬂight on December 17, 1903 (see Section 1.1). Clearly, in the earlydays of powered ﬂight, airfoil design was basically customized and personalized.However, in the early 1930s, NACA—the forerunner of NASA—embarked on aseries of deﬁnitive airfoil experiments using airfoil shapes that were constructedrationally and systematically. Many of these NACA airfoils are in common usetoday. Therefore, in this chapter we follow the nomenclature established by theNACA; such nomenclature is now a well-known standard. Consider the airfoil sketched in Figure 4.8. The mean camber line is the locus of points halfway between the upper and lower surfaces as measuredperpendicular to the mean camber line itself. The most forward and rearwardpoints of the mean camber line are the leading and trailing edges, respectively. The straight line connecting the leading and trailing edges is the chord line of the airfoil, and the precise distance from the leading to the trailing edgemeasured along the chord line is simply designated the chord c of the airfoil. The camber is the maximum distance between the mean camber line and the chord line, measured perpendicular to the chord line. The thickness is the dis- tance between the upper and lower surfaces, also measured perpendicular tothe chord line. The shape of the airfoil at the leading edge is usually circular,with a leading-edge radius of approximately 0.02c . The shapes of all standard NACA airfoils are generated by specifying the shape of the mean camber line andthen wrapping a speciﬁed symmetrical thickness distribution around the meancamber line. The force-and-moment system on an airfoil was discussed in Section 1.5, and the relative wind, angle of attack, lift, and drag were deﬁned in Figure 1.16.You should review these considerations before proceeding further. Figure 4.8 Airfoil nomenclature.Anderson-3930659 book August 29, 2016 10:35 CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 327 The NACA identiﬁed different airfoil shapes with a logical numbering sys- tem. For example, the ﬁrst family of NACA airfoils, developed in the 1930s, was the “four-digit” series, such as the NACA 2412 airfoil. Here, the ﬁrst digit is themaximum camber in hundredths of chord, the second digit is the location of max-imum camber along the chord from the leading edge in tenths of chord, and thelast two digits give the maximum thickness in hundredths of chord. For the NACA2412 airfoil, the maximum camber is 0.02c located at 0.4c from the leading edge, and the maximum thickness is 0.12c . It is common practice to state these numbers in percent of chord, that is, 2 percent camber at 40 percent chord, with 12 percentthickness. An airfoil with no camber, that is, with the camber line and chord linecoincident, is called a symmetric airfoil. Clearly, the shape of a symmetric airfoil is the same above and below the chord line. For example, the NACA 0012 airfoilis a symmetric airfoil with a maximum thickness of 12 percent. The second family of NACA airfoils was the “ﬁve-digit” series, such as the NACA 23012 airfoil. Here, the ﬁrst digit when multiplied by 3 2gives the design lift coefﬁcient1in tenths, the next two digits when divided by 2 give the location of maximum camber along the chord from the leading edge in hundredths of chord,and the ﬁnal two digits give the maximum thickness in hundredths of chord. Forthe NACA 23012 airfoil, the design lift coefﬁcient is 0.3, the location of maximumcamber is at 0.15c , and the airfoil has 12 percent maximum thickness. One of the most widely used family of NACA airfoils is the “6-series” laminar ﬂow airfoils, developed during World War II. An example is the NACA 65-218.Here, the ﬁrst digit simply identiﬁes the series, the second gives the location ofminimum pressure in tenths of chord from the leading edge (for the basic symmet-ric thickness distribution at zero lift), the third digit is the design lift coefﬁcientin tenths, and the last two digits give the maximum thickness in hundredths ofchord. For the NACA 65-218 airfoil, the 6 is the series designation, the minimumpressure occurs at 0.5c for the basic symmetric thickness distribution at zero lift, the design lift coefﬁcient is 0.2, and the airfoil is 18 percent thick. The complete NACA airfoil numbering system is given in Reference 11. Indeed, Reference 11 is a deﬁnitive presentation of the classic NACA airfoil workup to 1949. It contains a discussion of airfoil theory, its application, coordinatesfor the shape of NACA airfoils, and a huge bulk of experimental data for theseairfoils. This author strongly encourages you to read Reference 11 for a thoroughpresentation of airfoil characteristics. As a matter of interest, the following is a short partial listing of airplanes currently in service that use standard NACA airfoils. 1The design lift coefﬁcient is the theoretical lift coefﬁcient for the airfoil when the angle of attack is such that the slope of the mean camber line at the leading edge is parallel to the freestream velocity. In terms of the Kutta condition to be discussed in Section 4.5, this conﬁguration corresponds to the Kuttacondition holding at the leading edge as well as the trailing edge, i.e., the vortex sheet strength at theleading edge must be zero because the ﬂow velocity just above the leading edge is the same as the ﬂowvelocity just below the leading edge.328 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Airplane Airfoil Beechcraft Sundowner NACA 63A415 Beechcraft Bonanza NACA 23016.5 (at root) NACA 23012 (at tip) Cessna 150 NACA 2412 Fairchild A-10 NACA 6716 (at root)NACA 6713 (at tip) Gates Learjet 24D NACA 64A109General Dynamics F-16 NACA 64A204Lockheed C-5 Galaxy NACA 0012 (modiﬁed) In addition, many of the large aircraft companies today design their own special- purpose airfoils; for example, the Boeing 727, 737, 747, 757, 767, and 777 allhave specially designed Boeing airfoils. Such capability is made possible bymodern airfoil design computer programs utilizing either panel techniques ordirect numerical ﬁnite-difference solutions of the governing partial differentialequations for the ﬂow ﬁeld. (Such equations are developed in Chapter 2.) 4.3 AIRFOIL CHARACTERISTICS Before discussing the theoretical calculation of airfoil properties, let us examinesome typical results. During the 1930s and 1940s, the NACA carried out numerousmeasurements of the lift, drag, and moment coefﬁcients on the standard NACAairfoils. These experiments were performed at low speeds in a wind tunnel wherethe constant-chord wing spanned the entire test section from one sidewall to theother. In this fashion, the ﬂow “sees” a wing without wing tips—a so-called inﬁnitewing, which theoretically stretches to inﬁnity along the span (in the ydirection in Figure 4.6). Because the airfoil section is the same at any spanwise location alongthe inﬁnite wing, the properties of the airfoil and the inﬁnite wing are identical.Hence, airfoil data are frequently called inﬁnite wing data. (In contrast, we seein Chapter 5 that the properties of a ﬁnite wing are somewhat different from itsairfoil properties.) The typical variation of lift coefﬁcient with angle of attack for an airfoil is sketched in Figure 4.9. At low-to-moderate angles of attack, c lvaries linearly with α; the slope of this straight line is denoted by a0and is called the lift slope. In this region, the ﬂow moves smoothly over the airfoil and is attached over most ofthe surface, as shown in the streamline picture at the left of Figure 4.9. However,asαbecomes large, the ﬂow tends to separate from the top surface of the airfoil, creating a large wake of relatively “dead air” behind the airfoil as shown at theright of Figure 4.9. Inside this separated region, the ﬂow is recirculating, and partof the ﬂow is actually moving in a direction opposite to the freestream—so-calledreversed ﬂow. (Refer also to Figure 1.42.) This separated ﬂow is due to viscouseffects and is discussed in Section 4.12 and Chapter 15. The consequence of thisseparated ﬂow at high αis a precipitous decrease in lift and a large increase in drag; under such conditions the airfoil is said to be stalled. The maximumCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 329 Figure 4.9 Schematic of lift-coefﬁcient variation with angle of attack for an airfoil. value of cl, which occurs just prior to the stall, is denoted by cl,max; it is one of the most important aspects of airfoil performance, because it determines the stalling speed of an airplane. The higher is cl,max, the lower is the stalling speed. A great deal of modern airfoil research has been directed toward increasing cl,max. Again examining Figure 4.9, we see that clincreases linearly with αuntil ﬂow separation begins to have an effect. Then the curve becomes nonlinear, clreaches a maximum value, and ﬁnally the airfoil stalls. At the other extreme of the curve,noting Figure 4.9, the lift at α=0 is ﬁnite; indeed, the lift goes to zero only when the airfoil is pitched to some negative angle of attack. The value of αwhen lift equals zero is called the zero-lift angle of attack and is denoted by α L=0. For a symmetric airfoil, αL=0=0, whereas for all airfoils with positive camber (camber above the chord line), αL=0is a negative value, usually on the order of −2 or −3◦. The inviscid ﬂow airfoil theory discussed in this chapter allows us to predict the lift slope a0andαL=0for a given airfoil. It does not allow us to calculate cl,max, which is a difﬁcult viscous ﬂow problem, to be discussed in Chapters 15 to 20. Experimental results for lift and moment coefﬁcients for the NACA 2412 airfoil are given in Figure 4.10. Here, the moment coefﬁcient is taken about thequarter-chord point. Recall from Section 1.6 that the force-and-moment systemon an airfoil can be transferred to any convenient point; however, the quarter-chord point is commonly used. (Refresh your mind on this concept by reviewingSection 1.6, especially Figure 1.25.) Also shown in Figure 4.10 are theoreticalresults to be discussed later. Note that the experimental data are given for twodifferent Reynolds numbers. The lift slope a 0is not inﬂuenced by Re; however, cl,maxis dependent upon Re. This makes sense, because cl,maxis governed by viscous effects, and Re is a similarity parameter that governs the strength of inertiaforces relative to viscous forces in the ﬂow. [See Section 1.7 and Equation (1.35).]330 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 4.10 Experimental data for lift coefﬁcient and moment coefﬁcient about the quarter-chord point for an NACA 2412 airfoil.

Also shown is acomparison with theory described in Section 4.8. The moment coefﬁcient is also insensitive to Re except at large α. The NACA 2412 airfoil is a commonly used airfoil, and the results given in Figure 4.10 are quite typical of airfoil characteristics. For example, note from Figure 4.10 thatα L=0=−2.1◦,cl,max≈1.6, and the stall occurs at α≈16◦. This chapter deals primarily with airfoil theory for an inviscid, incompressible ﬂow; such theory is incapable of predicting airfoil drag, as noted earlier. However,for the sake of completeness, experimental data for the drag coefﬁcient c dfor the NACA 2412 airfoil are given in Figure 4.11 as a function of the angle of attack.2 The physical source of this drag coefﬁcient is both skin friction drag and pres-sure drag due to ﬂow separation (so-called form drag). The sum of these two 2In many references, such as Reference 11, it is common to plot cdversus cl, rather than versus α. A plot ofcdversus clis called a drag polar. For the sake of consistency with Figure 4.10, we choose to plot cd versus αhere.CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 331 Figure 4.11 Experimental data for proﬁle drag coefﬁcient and moment coefﬁcient about the aerodynamic center for the NACA 2412 airfoil.

Note that cdis sensitive to Re, which is to be expected since both skin friction and ﬂow separation are viscous effects. Again, we must wait until Section 4.12 and Chapters 15 to 20 to obtain some tools for theoreticallypredicting c d. Also plotted in Figure 4.11 is the moment coefﬁcient about the aerodynamic center cm,ac. In general, moments on an airfoil are a function of α. However, there is one point on the airfoil about which the moment is independent of angle ofattack; such a point is deﬁned as the aerodynamic center. Clearly, the data in Figure 4.11 illustrate a constant value for c m,acover a wide range of α. For an elementary but extensive discussion of airfoil and wing properties, see Chapter 5 of Reference 2.

The lift per unit span is 1254 N/m.Calculate the angle of attack and the drag per unit span.332 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow ■Solution At standard sea level, ρ=1.23 kg/m3: q∞=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞=1 2(1.23)(70)2=3013.5 N/m2 cl=L/prime q∞S=L/prime q∞c(1)=1254 3013.5(0.64)=0.65 From Figure 4.10, for cl=0.65, we obtain α=4◦.

Hence, Re=ρ∞V∞c μ∞=1.23(70)(0.64) 1.789×10−5=3.08×106 Therefore, using the data for Re =3.1×106in Figure 4.11, we ﬁnd cd=0.0068.

The maximum lift-to-drag ratio, (L/D)max, is an important parameter in airfoil performance; it is a direct measure of aerodynamic efﬁciency. Thehigher the value of (L/D) max, the more efﬁcient is the airfoil. The values of L/Dfor airfoils are quite large numbers in comparison to that for a complete airplane. Due to theextra drag associated with all parts of the airplane, values of (L/D) maxfor real airplanes are on the order of 10 to 20. 4.4 PHILOSOPHY OF THEORETICAL SOLUTIONS FOR LOW-SPEED FLOW OVER AIRFOILS: THE VORTEX SHEET In Section 3.14, the concept of vortex ﬂow was introduced; refer to Figure 3.31 for a schematic of the ﬂow induced by a point vortex of strength /Gamma1located at a given point O. (Recall that Figure 3.31, with its counterclockwise ﬂow, corresponds to a negative value of /Gamma1. By convention, a positive /Gamma1induces a clockwise ﬂow.) Let us now expand our concept of a point vortex. Referring to Figure 3.31, imaginea straight line perpendicular to the page, going through point O, and extending to inﬁnity both out of and into the page. This line is a straight vortex ﬁlament of strength /Gamma1. A straight vortex ﬁlament is drawn in perspective in Figure 4.12. (Here, we show a clockwise ﬂow, which corresponds to a positive value of /Gamma1.) The ﬂow induced in any plane perpendicular to the straight vortex ﬁlament by theﬁlament itself is identical to that induced by a point vortex of strength /Gamma1; that is, in Figure 4.12, the ﬂows in the planes perpendicular to the vortex ﬁlament at O andO /primeare identical to each other and are identical to the ﬂow induced by a point vortex of strength /Gamma1. Indeed, the point vortex described in Section 3.14 is simply a section of a straight vortex ﬁlament. In Section 3.17, we introduced the concept of a source sheet, which is an inﬁ- nite number of line sources side by side, with the strength of each line source beinginﬁnitesimally small. For vortex ﬂow, consider an analogous situation. Imaginean inﬁnite number of straight vortex ﬁlaments side by side, where the strength ofeach ﬁlament is inﬁnitesimally small. These side-by-side vortex ﬁlaments form avortex sheet, as shown in perspective in the upper left of Figure 4.13. If we look along the series of vortex ﬁlaments (looking along the yaxis in Figure 4.13), the vortex sheet will appear as sketched at the lower right of Figure 4.13. Here, weare looking at an edge view of the sheet; the vortex ﬁlaments are all perpendicular334 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 4.12 V ortex ﬁlament. Figure 4.13 V ortex sheet.CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 335 to the page. Let sbe the distance measured along the vortex sheet in the edge view. Deﬁne γ=γ(s)as the strength of the vortex sheet, per unit length along s. Thus, the strength of an inﬁnitesimal portion dsof the sheet is γds. This small section of the vortex sheet can be treated as a distinct vortex of strength γds. Now consider point Pin the ﬂow, located a distance rfrom ds; the cartesian coordinates of Pare(x,z). The small section of the vortex sheet of strength γds induces an inﬁnitesimally small velocity dVat point P. From Equation (3.105), dVis given by dV=−γds 2πr(4.1) and is in a direction perpendicular to r, as shown in Figure 4.13. The velocity atPinduced by the entire vortex sheet is the summation of Equation (4.1) from point ato point b. Note that dV, which is perpendicular to r, changes direction at point Pas we sum from atob; hence, the incremental velocities induced at Pby different sections of the vortex sheet must be added vectorally. Because of this, it is sometimes more convenient to deal with the velocity potential. Again referringto Figure 4.13, the increment in velocity potential dφinduced at point Pby the elemental vortex γdsis, from Equation (3.112), dφ=−γds 2πθ (4.2) In turn, the velocity potential at Pdue to the entire vortex sheet from atobis φ(x,z)=−1 2π/integraldisplayb aθγds (4.3) Equation (4.1) is particularly useful for our discussion of classical thin airfoiltheory, whereas Equation (4.3) is important for the numerical vortex panel method. Recall from Section 3.14 that the circulation /Gamma1around a point vortex is equal to the strength of the vortex. Similarly, the circulation around the vortex sheet inFigure 4.13 is the sum of the strengths of the elemental vortices; that is, /Gamma1=/integraldisplayb aγds (4.4) Recall that the source sheet introduced in Section 3.17 has a discontinuous change in the direction of the normal component of velocity across the sheet (from Figure 3.38, note that the normal component of velocity changes directionby 180 ◦in crossing the sheet), whereas the tangential component of velocity is the same immediately above and below the source sheet. In contrast, for a vortexsheet, there is a discontinuous change in the tangential component of velocityacross the sheet, whereas the normal component of velocity is preserved acrossthe sheet. This change in tangential velocity across the vortex sheet is relatedto the strength of the sheet as follows. Consider a vortex sheet as sketched in336 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 4.14 Tangential velocity jump across a vortex sheet. Figure 4.14. Consider the rectangular dashed path enclosing a section of the sheet of length ds. The velocity components tangential to the top and bottom of this rectangular path are u1andu2, respectively, and the velocity components tangential to the left and right sides are v1andv2, respectively. The top and bottom of the path are separated by the distance dn. From the deﬁnition of circulation given by Equation (2.136), the circulation around the dashed path is /Gamma1=−(v2dn−u1ds−v1dn+u2ds) or /Gamma1=(u1−u2)ds+(v1−v2)dn (4.5) However, since the strength of the vortex sheet contained inside the dashed pathisγds, we also have /Gamma1=γds (4.6) Therefore, from Equations (4.5) and (4.6), γds=(u 1−u2)ds+(v1−v2)dn (4.7) Let the top and bottom of the dashed line approach the vortex sheet; that is, letdn→0. In the limit, u 1andu2become the velocity components tangential to the vortex sheet immediately above and below the sheet, respectively, andEquation (4.7) becomes γds=(u 1−u2)ds or γ=u1−u2 (4.8) Equation (4.8) is important; it states that the local jump in tangential velocity across the vortex sheet is equal to the local sheet strength. We have now deﬁned and discussed the properties of a vortex sheet. The con- cept of a vortex sheet is instrumental in the analysis of the low-speed characteris-tics of an airfoil. A philosophy of airfoil theory of inviscid, incompressible ﬂowis as follows. Consider an airfoil of arbitrary shape and thickness in a freestreamwith velocity V ∞, as sketched in Figure 4.15. Replace the airfoil surface with a vortex sheet of variable strength γ(s), as also shown in Figure 4.15. Calculate the variation of γas a function of ssuch that the induced velocity ﬁeld from the vortex sheet when added to the uniform velocity of magnitude V∞will makeCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 337 Figure 4.15 Simulation of an arbitrary airfoil by distributing a vortex sheet over the airfoil surface. the vortex sheet (hence the airfoil surface) a streamline of the ﬂow. In turn, the circulation around the airfoil will be given by /Gamma1=/integraldisplay γds where the integral is taken around the complete surface of the airfoil. Finally, the resulting lift is given by the Kutta-Joukowski theorem: L/prime=ρ∞V∞/Gamma1 This philosophy is not new. It was ﬁrst espoused by Ludwig Prandtl and his colleagues at G¨ ottingen, Germany, during the period 1912–1922. However, nogeneral analytical solution for γ=γ(s)exists for an airfoil of arbitrary shape and thickness. Rather, the strength of the vortex sheet must be found numerically,and the practical implementation of the above philosophy had to wait until the1960s with the advent of large digital computers. Today, the above philosophy isthe foundation of the modern vortex panel method, to be discussed in Section 4.9. The concept of replacing the airfoil surface in Figure 4.15 with a vortex sheet is more than just a mathematical device; it also has physical signiﬁcance. In reallife, there is a thin boundary layer on the surface, due to the action of frictionbetween the surface and the airﬂow (see Figures 1.41 and 1.46). This boundarylayer is a highly viscous region in which the large velocity gradients producesubstantial vorticity; that is, ∇×Vis ﬁnite within the boundary layer. (Review Section 2.12 for a discussion of vorticity.) Hence, in real life, there is a distributionof vorticity along the airfoil surface due to viscous effects, and our philosophy ofreplacing the airfoil surface with a vortex sheet (such as in Figure 4.15) can beconstrued as a way of modeling this effect in an inviscid ﬂow. 3 Imagine that the airfoil in Figure 4.15 is made very thin. If you were to stand back and look at such a thin airfoil from a distance, the portions of the vortex sheet 3It is interesting to note that some recent research by NASA is hinting that even as complex a problem as ﬂow separation, heretofore thought to be a completely viscous-dominated phenomenon, may in reality be an inviscid-dominated ﬂow which requires only a rotational ﬂow. For example, some inviscid ﬂow-ﬁeldnumerical solutions for ﬂow over a circular cylinder, when vorticity is introduced either by means of anonuniform freestream or a curved shock wave, are accurately predicting the separated ﬂow on therearward side of the cylinder. However, as exciting as these results may be, they are too preliminary to beemphasized in this book. We continue to talk about ﬂow separation in Chapters 15 to 20 as being aviscous-dominated effect, until deﬁnitely proved otherwise. This recent research is mentioned here onlyas another example of the physical connection between vorticity, vortex sheets, viscosity, and real life.338 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 4.16 Thin airfoil approximation. on the top and bottom surface of the airfoil would almost coincide. This gives rise to a method of approximating a thin airfoil by replacing it with a single vortexsheet distributed over the camber line of the airfoil, as sketched in Figure 4.16.The strength of this vortex sheet γ(s)is calculated such that, in combination with the freestream, the camber line becomes a streamline of the ﬂow. Althoughthe approach shown in Figure 4.16 is approximate in comparison with the caseshown in Figure 4.15, it has the advantage of yielding a closed-form analyticalsolution. This philosophy of thin airfoil theory was ﬁrst developed by Max Munk,a colleague of Prandtl, in 1922 (see Reference 12). It is discussed in Sections 4.7and 4.8. 4.5 THE KUTTA CONDITION The lifting ﬂow over a circular cylinder was discussed in Section 3.15, wherewe observed that an inﬁnite number of potential ﬂow solutions were possible,corresponding to the inﬁnite choice of /Gamma1. For example, Figure 3.33 illustrates three different ﬂows over the cylinder, corresponding to three different values of/Gamma1. The same situation applies to the potential ﬂow over an airfoil; for a given airfoil at a given angle of attack, there are an inﬁnite number of valid theoreticalsolutions, corresponding to an inﬁnite choice of /Gamma1. For example, Figure 4.17 illustrates two different ﬂows over the same airfoil at the same angle of attack butwith different values of /Gamma1. At ﬁrst, this may seem to pose a dilemma. We know from experience that a given airfoil at a given angle of attack produces a singlevalue of lift (e.g., see Figure 4.10). So, although there is an inﬁnite number ofpossible potential ﬂow solutions, nature knows how to pick a particular solution.Clearly, the philosophy discussed in the previous section is not complete—weneed an additional condition that ﬁxes/Gamma1for a given airfoil at a given α. To attempt to ﬁnd this condition, let us examine some experimental results for the development of the ﬂow ﬁeld around an airfoil which is set into motion froman initial state of rest. Figure 4.18 shows a series of classic photographs of the ﬂowover an airfoil, taken from Prandtl and Tietjens (Reference 8). In Figure 4.18a, theﬂow has just started, and the ﬂow pattern is just beginning to develop around theairfoil. In these early moments of development, the ﬂow tries to curl aroundthe sharp trailing edge from the bottom surface to the top surface, similar to thesketch shown at the left of Figure 4.17. However, more advanced considerationsof inviscid, incompressible ﬂow (see, e.g., Reference 9) show the theoreticalresult that the velocity becomes inﬁnitely large at a sharp corner. Hence, the typeFigure 4.17 Effect of different values of circulation on the potential ﬂow over a given airfoil at a given angle of attack. Points 1 and 2 are stagnation points.

(c) The ﬁnal steady ﬂow. (Prandtl, L., and O. G. Tietjens: Applied Hydro and Aeromechanics Based on Lectures of L. Prandtl, United Engineering Trustees Inc.,1934, McGraw-Hill, New York.) of ﬂow sketched at the left of Figure 4.17, and shown in Figure 4.18a, is not tolerated very long by nature. Rather, as the real ﬂow develops over the airfoil,the stagnation point on the upper surface (point 2 in Figure 4.17) moves towardthe trailing edge. Figure 4.18b shows this intermediate stage. Finally, after the initial transient process dies out, the steady ﬂow shown in Figure 4.18c is reached. This photograph demonstrates that the ﬂow is smoothly leaving the top and the bottom surfaces of the airfoil at the trailing edge. This ﬂow pattern is sketched atthe right of Figure 4.17 and represents the type of pattern to be expected for thesteady ﬂow over an airfoil. Reﬂecting on Figures 4.17 and 4.18, we emphasize again that in establishing the steady ﬂow over a given airfoil at a given angle of attack, nature adoptsthat particular value of circulation (/Gamma1 2in Figure 4.17) which results in the ﬂow leaving smoothly at the trailing edge. This observation was ﬁrst made and used ina theoretical analysis by the German mathematician M. Wilhelm Kutta in 1902.Therefore, it has become known as the Kutta condition. In order to apply the Kutta condition in a theoretical analysis, we need to be more precise about the nature of the ﬂow at the trailing edge. The trailing edgecan have a ﬁnite angle, as shown in Figures 4.17 and 4.18 and as sketched at theleft of Figure 4.19, or it can be cusped, as shown at the right of Figure 4.19. First,consider the trailing edge with a ﬁnite angle, as shown at the left of Figure 4.19.Denote the velocities along the top surface and the bottom surface as V 1andV2, respectively. V1is parallel to the top surface at point a, and V2is parallel to the bottom surface at point a. For the ﬁnite-angle trailing edge, if these velocities wereCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 341 a a At point a: V1 = V2 = 0 At point a: V1 = V2 /HV11005 0Cusp Finite angle V2 V1V1 V2 Figure 4.19 Different possible shapes of the trailing edge and their relation to the Kutta condition. ﬁnite at point a, then we would have two velocities in two different directions at the same point, as shown at the left of Figure 4.19. However, this is not physically possible, and the only recourse is for both V1andV2to be zero at point a. That is, for the ﬁnite trailing edge, point ais a stagnation point, where V1=V2=0. In contrast, for the cusped trailing edge shown at the right of Figure 4.19, V1and V2are in the same direction at point a, and hence both V1andV2can be ﬁnite. However, the pressure at point a,p2, is a single, unique value, and Bernoulli’s equation applied at both the top and bottom surfaces immediately adjacent topoint ayields p a+1 2ρV2 1=pa+1 2ρV2 2 or V1=V2 Hence, for the cusped trailing edge, we see that the velocities leaving the top andbottom surfaces of the airfoil at the trailing edge are ﬁnite and equal in magnitudeand direction. We can summarize the statement of the Kutta condition as follows: 1.For a given airfoil at a given angle of attack, the value of /Gamma1around the airfoil is such that the ﬂow leaves the trailing edge smoothly. 2.If the trailing-edge angle is ﬁnite, then the trailing edge is a stagnation point. 3.If the trailing edge is cusped, then the velocities leaving the top and bottomsurfaces at the trailing edge are ﬁnite and equal in magnitude and direction. Consider again the philosophy of simulating the airfoil with vortex sheets placed either on the surface or on the camber line, as discussed in Section 4.4. The strength of such a vortex sheet is variable along the sheet and is denotedbyγ(s). The statement of the Kutta condition in terms of the vortex sheet is as follows. At the trailing edge (TE), from Equation (4.8), we have γ(TE)=γ(a)=V 1−V2 (4.9) However, for the ﬁnite-angle trailing edge, V1=V2=0; hence, from Equa- tion (4.9), γ(TE)=0. For the cusped trailing edge, V1=V2/negationslash=0; hence, from Equation (4.9), we again obtain the result that γ(TE)=0. Therefore, the Kutta342 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow condition expressed in terms of the strength of the vortex sheet is γ(TE)=0 (4.10) 4.5.1 Without Friction Could We Have Lift? In Section 1.5 we emphasized that the resultant aerodynamic force on a body immersed in a ﬂow is due to the net integrated effect of the pressure and shearstress distributions over the body surface. Moreover, in Section 4.1 we notedthat lift on an airfoil is primarily due to the surface pressure distribution, andthat shear stress has virtually no effect on lift. It is easy to see why. Look at theairfoil shapes in Figures 4.17 and 4.18, for example. Recall that pressure actsnormal to the surface, and for these airfoils the direction of this normal pressure is essentially in the vertical direction, that is, the lift direction. In contrast, theshear stress acts tangential to the surface, and for these airfoils the direction of this tangential shear stress is mainly in the horizontal direction, that is, the dragdirection. Hence, pressure is the dominant player in the generation of lift, andshear stress has a negligible effect on lift. It is for this reason that the lift on anairfoil below the stall can be accurately predicted by inviscid theories such as that discussed in this chapter. However, if we lived in a perfectly inviscid world, an airfoil could not pro- duce lift. Indeed, the presence of friction is the very reason why we have lift.These sound like strange, even contradictory statements to our discussion in thepreceding paragraph. What is going on here? The answer is that in real life, thewaythat nature insures that the ﬂow will leave smoothly at the trailing edge, that is, the mechanism that nature uses to choose the ﬂow shown in Figure 4.18c, isthat the viscous boundary layer remains attached to the surface all the way to thetrailing edge. Nature enforces the Kutta condition by means of friction. If there were no boundary layer (i.e., no friction), there would be no physical mechanismin the real world to achieve the Kutta condition. So we are led to the most ironic situation that lift, which is created by the surface pressure distribution—an inviscid phenomenon, would not exist in a fric-tionless (inviscid) world. In this regard, we can say that without friction we couldnot have lift. However, we say this in the informed manner as discussed above. 4.6 KELVIN’S CIRCULATION THEOREM AND THE STARTING VORTEX In this section, we put the ﬁnishing touch to the overall philosophy of airfoiltheory before developing the quantitative aspects of the theory itself in subsequentsections. This section also ties up a loose end introduced by the Kutta conditiondescribed in the previous section. Speciﬁcally, the Kutta condition states that thecirculation around an airfoil is just the right value to ensure that the ﬂow smoothlyleaves the trailing edge. Question: How does nature generate this circulation?CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 343 Figure 4.20 Kelvin’s theorem. Does it come from nowhere, or is circulation somehow conserved over the whole ﬂow ﬁeld? Let us examine these matters more closely. Consider an arbitrary inviscid, incompressible ﬂow as sketched in Figure 4.20. Assume that all body forces fare zero. Choose an arbitrary curve C1and identify the ﬂuid elements that are on this curve at a given instant in time t1. Also, by deﬁnition the circulation around curve C1is/Gamma11=−/integraltext C1V·ds.Now let these speciﬁc ﬂuid elements move downstream. At some later time, t2, these same ﬂuid elements will form another curve C2, around which the circulation is /Gamma12= −/integraltext C2V·ds.For the conditions stated above, we can readily show that /Gamma11=/Gamma12. In fact, since we are following a set of speciﬁc ﬂuid elements, we can state thatcirculation around a closed curve formed by a set of contiguous ﬂuid elementsremains constant as the ﬂuid elements move throughout the ﬂow. Recall fromSection 2.9 that the substantial derivative gives the time rate of change followinga given ﬂuid element. Hence, a mathematical statement of the above discussionis simply D/Gamma1 Dt=0 (4.11) which says that the time rate of change of circulation around a closed curveconsisting of the same ﬂuid elements is zero. Equation (4.11) along with itssupporting discussion is called Kelvin’s circulation theorem. 4Its derivation from 4Kelvin’s theorem also holds for an inviscid compressible ﬂow in the special case where ρ=ρ(p); that is, the density is some single-valued function of pressure. Such is the case for isentropic ﬂow, to be treated in later chapters.344 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 4.21 The creation of the starting vortex and the resulting generation of circulation around the airfoil. ﬁrst principles is left as Problem 4.3. Also, recall our deﬁnition and discussion of a vortex sheet in Section 4.4. An interesting consequence of Kelvin’s circulationtheorem is proof that a stream surface which is a vortex sheet at some instant intime remains a vortex sheet for all times. Kelvin’s theorem helps to explain the generation of circulation around an airfoil, as follows. Consider an airfoil in a ﬂuid at rest, as shown in Figure 4.21a.Because V=0 everywhere, the circulation around curve C 1is zero. Now start the ﬂow in motion over the airfoil. Initially, the ﬂow will tend to curl around thetrailing edge, as explained in Section 4.5 and illustrated at the left of Figure 4.17.In so doing, the velocity at the trailing edge theoretically becomes inﬁnite. In reallife, the velocity tends toward a very large ﬁnite number. Consequently, duringthe very ﬁrst moments after the ﬂow is started, a thin region of very large velocitygradients (and therefore high vorticity) is formed at the trailing edge. This high-vorticity region is ﬁxed to the same ﬂuid elements, and consequently it is ﬂusheddownstream as the ﬂuid elements begin to move downstream from the trailingedge. As it moves downstream, this thin sheet of intense vorticity is unstable, and ittends to roll up and form a picture similar to a point vortex. This vortex is called thestarting vortex and is sketched in Figure 4.21b. After the ﬂow around the airfoil has come to a steady state where the ﬂow leaves the trailing edge smoothly (the Kuttacondition), the high velocity gradients at the trailing edge disappear and vorticityCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 345 is no longer produced at that point. However, the starting vortex has already been formed during the starting process, and it moves steadily downstream with theﬂow forever after. Figure 4.21b shows the ﬂow ﬁeld sometime after steady ﬂow has been achieved over the airfoil, with the starting vortex somewhere downstream.The ﬂuid elements that initially made up curve C 1in Figure 4.21a have moved downstream and now make up curve C2, which is the complete circuit abcda shown in Figure 4.21b. Thus, from Kelvin’s theorem, the circulation /Gamma12around curve C2(which encloses both the airfoil and the starting vortex) is the same as that around curve C1, namely, zero. /Gamma12=/Gamma11=0. Now let us subdivide C2 into two loops by making the cut bd, thus forming curves C3(circuit bcdb) and C4(circuit abda). Curve C3encloses the starting vortex, and curve C4encloses the airfoil. The circulation /Gamma13around curve C3is due to the starting vortex; by inspecting Figure 4.21b, we see that /Gamma13is in the counterclockwise direction (i.e., a negative value). The circulation around curve C4enclosing the airfoil is /Gamma14. Since the cut bdis common to both C3andC4, the sum of the circulations around C3andC4is simply equal to the circulation around C2: /Gamma13+/Gamma14=/Gamma12 However, we have already established that /Gamma12=0. Hence, /Gamma14=−/Gamma13 that is, the circulation around the airfoil is equal and opposite to the circulationaround the starting vortex. This brings us to the summary as well as the crux of this section. As the ﬂow over an airfoil is started, the large velocity gradients at the sharp trailing edge resultin the formation of a region of intense vorticity which rolls up downstream of thetrailing edge, forming the starting vortex. This starting vortex has associated withit a counterclockwise circulation. Therefore, as an equal-and-opposite reaction, aclockwise circulation around the airfoil is generated. As the starting process con-tinues, vorticity from the trailing edge is constantly fed into the starting vortex,making it stronger with a consequent larger counterclockwise circulation. In turn,the clockwise circulation around the airfoil becomes stronger, making the ﬂow atthe trailing edge more closely approach the Kutta condition, thus weakening thevorticity shed from the trailing edge. Finally, the starting vortex builds up to justthe right strength such that the equal-and-opposite clockwise circulation aroundthe airfoil leads to smooth ﬂow from the trailing edge (the Kutta condition isexactly satisﬁed). When this happens, the vorticity shed from the trailing edgebecomes zero, the starting vortex no longer grows in strength, and a steadycirculation exists around the airfoil. EXAMPLE 4.4 For the NACA 2412 airfoil at the conditions given in Example 4.1, calculate the strength of the steady-state starting vortex.346 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow ■Solution From the given conditions in Example 4.1, L/prime=1254 N/m V∞=70 m/s ρ∞=1.23 kg/m3 From the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, Equation (3.140), L/prime=ρ∞V∞/Gamma1 the circulation associated with the ﬂow over the airfoil is /Gamma1=L/prime ρ∞V∞=1254 (1.23)(70)=14.56m2 s Referring to Figure 4.21, the steady-state starting vortex has strength equal and opposite to the circulation around the airfoil. Hence, Strength of starting vortex =−14.56m2 s Note: For practical calculations in aerodynamics, an actual number for circulation is rarely needed. Circulation is a mathematical quantity deﬁned by Equation (2.136), and it is anessential theoretical concept within the framework of the circulation theory of lift. Forexample, in Section 4.7, an analytical expression for circulation is derived as Equation(4.30), and then immediately inserted into the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, Equation (4.31),yielding a formula for the lift coefﬁcient, Equation (4.33). Nowhere do we need to calcu-late an actual number for /Gamma1. In the present example, however, the strength of the starting vortex is indeed given by its circulation, and hence to compare the strengths of variousstarting vortices, calculating numbers for /Gamma1is relevant. Even this can be considered only an academic exercise. In this author’s experience, no practical aerodynamic calculation re-quires the strength of a starting vortex. The starting vortex is simply a theoretical constructthat is consistent with the generation of circulation around a lifting two-dimensional body. 4.7 CLASSICAL THIN AIRFOIL THEORY: THE SYMMETRIC AIRFOIL Some experimentally observed characteristics of airfoils and a philosophy for the theoretical prediction of these characteristics have been discussed in the pre-ceding sections. Referring to our chapter road map in Figure 4.7, we have nowcompleted the central branch. In this section, we move to the right-hand branchof Figure 4.7, namely, a quantitative development of thin airfoil theory. The basicequations necessary for the calculation of airfoil lift and moments are establishedin this section, with an application to symmetric airfoils. The case of camberedairfoils will be treated in Section 4.8.CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 347 For the time being, we deal with thin airfoils; for such a case, the airfoil can be simulated by a vortex sheet placed along the camber line, as discussed in Section 4.4. Our purpose is to calculate the variation of γ(s)such that the camber line becomes a streamline of the ﬂow and such that the Kutta conditionis satisﬁed at the trailing edge; that is, γ(TE)=0 [see Equation (4.10)]. Once we have found the particular γ(s)that satisﬁes these conditions, then the total circulation /Gamma1around the airfoil is found by integrating γ(s)from the leading edge to the trailing edge. In turn, the lift is calculated from /Gamma1via the Kutta-Joukowski theorem. Consider a vortex sheet placed on the camber line of an airfoil, as sketched in Figure 4.22a. The freestream velocity is V ∞, and the airfoil is at the angle of attack α. The xaxis is oriented along the chord line, and the zaxis is perpendicular to the chord. The distance measured along the camber line is denoted by s. The shape of the camber line is given by z=z(x). The chord length is c. In Figure 4.22a, w/primeis the component of velocity normal to the camber line induced by the vortex sheet; w/prime=w/prime(s). For a thin airfoil, we rationalized in Section 4.4 that the distribution of a vortex sheet over the surface of the airfoil, when viewed from adistance, looks almost the same as a vortex sheet placed on the camber line. Letus stand back once again and view Figure 4.22 afrom a distance. If the airfoil Figure 4.22 Placement of the vortex sheet for thin airfoil analysis.348 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow is thin, the camber line is close to the chord line, and viewed from a distance, the vortex sheet appears to fall approximately on the chord line. Therefore, onceagain, let us reorient our thinking and place the vortex sheet on the chord line,as sketched in Figure 4.22b. Here, γ=γ(x). We still wish the camber line to be a streamline of the ﬂow, and γ=γ(x)is calculated to satisfy this condition as well as the Kutta condition γ(c)=0. That is, the strength of the vortex sheet on the chord line is determined such that the camber line (not the chord line) is astreamline. For the camber line to be a streamline, the component of velocity normal to the camber line must be zero at all points along the camber line. The velocity atany point in the ﬂow is the sum of the uniform freestream velocity and the velocityinduced by the vortex sheet. Let V ∞,nbe the component of the freestream velocity normal to the camber line. Thus, for the camber line to be a streamline, V∞,n+w/prime(s)=0 (4.12) at every point along the camber line. An expression for V∞,nin Equation (4.12) is obtained by the inspection of Figure 4.23. At any point Pon the camber line, where the slope of the camber line is dz/dx, the geometry of Figure 4.23 yields V∞,n=V∞sin/bracketleftbigg α+tan−1/parenleftbigg −dz dx/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (4.13) For a thin airfoil at small angle of attack, both αand tan−1(−dz/dx)are small values. Using the approximation that sin θ≈tanθ≈θfor small θ, where θis in Figure 4.23 Determination of the component of freestream velocity normal to the camber line.CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 349 radians, Equation (4.13) reduces to V∞,n=V∞/parenleftbigg α−dz dx/parenrightbigg (4.14) Equation (4.14) gives the expression for V∞,nto be used in Equation (4.12). Keep in mind that, in Equation (4.14), αis in radians. Returning to Equation (4.12), let us develop an expression for w/prime(s)in terms of the strength of the vortex sheet. Refer again to Figure 4.22b. Here, the vortex sheet is along the chord line, and w/prime(s)is the component of velocity normal to the camber line induced by the vortex sheet. Let w(x)denote the component of velocity normal to the chord line induced by the vortex sheet, as also shown in Figure 4.22b. If the airfoil is thin, the camber line is close to the chord line, andit is consistent with thin airfoil theory to make the approximation that w /prime(s)≈w(x) (4.15) An expression for w(x)in terms of the strength of the vortex sheet is easily obtained from Equation (4.1), as follows. Consider Figure 4.24, which showsthe vortex sheet along the chord line. We wish to calculate the value of w(x)at the location x. Consider an elemental vortex of strength γdξlocated at a distance ξfrom the origin along the chord line, as shown in Figure 4.24. The strength of the vortex sheet γvaries with the distance along the chord; that is, γ=γ(ξ). The velocity dwat point xinduced by the elemental vortex at point ξis given by Equation (4.1) as dw=−γ(ξ) dξ 2π(x−ξ)(4.16) In turn, the velocity w(x)induced at point xbyallthe elemental vortices along the chord line is obtained by integrating Equation (4.16) from the leading edge(ξ=0)to the trailing edge (ξ=c): w(x)=−/integraldisplayc 0γ(ξ) dξ 2π(x−ξ)(4.17) Combined with the approximation stated by Equation (4.15), Equation (4.17)gives the expression for w /prime(s)to be used in Equation (4.12). Figure 4.24 Calculation of the induced velocity at the chord line.350 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Recall that Equation (4.12) is the boundary condition necessary for the camber line to be a streamline. Substituting Equations (4.14), (4.15), and (4.17) into (4.12), we obtain V∞/parenleftbigg α−dz dx/parenrightbigg −/integraldisplayc 0γ(ξ) dξ 2π(x−ξ)=0 or1 2π/integraldisplayc 0γ(ξ) dξ x−ξ=V∞/parenleftbigg α−dz dx/parenrightbigg (4.18) thefundamental equation of thin airfoil theory; it is simply a statement that the camber line is a streamline of the ﬂow. Note that Equation (4.18) is written at a given point xon the chord line, and that dz/dx is evaluated at that point x. The variable ξis simply a dummy variable of integration which varies from 0 to calong the chord line, as shown in Figure 4.24. The vortex strength γ=γ(ξ) is a variable along the chord line. For a given airfoil at a given angle of attack, both αanddz/dxare known values in Equation (4.18). Indeed, the only unknown in Equation (4.18) is the vortexstrength γ(ξ). Hence, Equation (4.18) is an integral equation, the solution of which yields the variation of γ(ξ) such that the camber line is a streamline of the ﬂow. The central problem of thin airfoil theory is to solve Equation (4.18) forγ(ξ), subject to the Kutta condition, namely, γ(c)=0. In this section, we treat the case of a symmetric airfoil. As stated in Section 4.2, a symmetric airfoil has no camber; the camber line is coincident with the chordline. Hence, for this case, dz/dx=0, and Equation (4.18) becomes 1 2π/integraldisplayc 0γ(ξ) dξ x−ξ=V∞α (4.19) In essence, within the framework of thin airfoil theory, a symmetric airfoil istreated the same as a ﬂat plate; note that our theoretical development does not ac-count for the airfoil thickness distribution. Equation (4.19) is an exact expression for the inviscid, incompressible ﬂow over a ﬂat plate at a small angle of attack. To help deal with the integral in Equations (4.18) and (4.19), let us transform ξintoθvia the following transformation: ξ=c 2(1−cosθ) (4.20) Since xis a ﬁxed point in Equations (4.18) and (4.19), it corresponds to a particular value of θ, namely, θ0, such that x=c 2(1−cosθ0) (4.21) Also, from Equation (4.20), dξ=c 2sinθdθ (4.22)CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 351 Substituting Equations (4.20) to (4.22) into (4.19), and noting that the limits of integration become θ=0 at the leading edge (where ξ=0) and θ=πat the trailing edge (where ξ=c), we obtain 1 2π/integraldisplayπ 0γ(θ) sinθdθ cosθ−cosθ0=V∞α (4.23) A rigorous solution of Equation (4.23) for γ(θ) can be obtained from the math- ematical theory of integral equations, which is beyond the scope of this book.Instead, we simply state that the solution is γ(θ)=2αV∞(1+cosθ) sinθ(4.24) We can verify this solution by substituting Equation (4.24) into (4.23) yielding 1 2π/integraldisplayπ 0γ(θ) sinθdθ cosθ−cosθ0=V∞α π/integraldisplayπ 0(1+cosθ)dθ cosθ−cosθ0(4.25) The following standard integral appears frequently in airfoil theory and is derivedin Appendix E of Reference 9: /integraldisplayπ 0cosnθdθ cosθ−cosθ0=πsinnθ0 sinθ0(4.26) Using Equation (4.26) in the right-hand side of Equation (4.25), we ﬁnd that V∞α π/integraldisplayπ 0(1+cosθ)dθ cosθ−cosθ0=V∞α π/parenleftbigg/integraldisplayπ 0dθ cosθ−cosθ0+/integraldisplayπ 0cosθdθ cosθ−cosθ0/parenrightbigg =V∞α π(0+π)=V∞α (4.27) Substituting Equation (4.27) into (4.25), we have 1 2π/integraldisplayπ 0γ(θ) sinθdθ cosθ−cosθ0=V∞α which is identical to Equation (4.23). Hence, we have shown that Equation (4.24)is indeed the solution to Equation (4.23). Also, note that at the trailing edge, whereθ=π, Equation (4.24) yields γ(π)=2αV ∞0 0 which is an indeterminant form. However, using L’Hospital’s rule on Equa-tion (4.24), γ(π)=2αV ∞−sinπ cosπ=0 Thus, Equation (4.24) also satisﬁes the Kutta condition.352 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow We are now in a position to calculate the lift coefﬁcient for a thin, symmetric airfoil. The total circulation around the airfoil is /Gamma1=/integraldisplayc 0γ(ξ) dξ (4.28) Using Equations (4.20) and (4.22), Equation (4.28) transforms to /Gamma1=c 2/integraldisplayπ 0γ(θ) sinθdθ (4.29) Substituting Equation (4.24) into (4.29), we obtain /Gamma1=αcV∞/integraldisplayπ 0(1+cosθ)dθ=παcV∞ (4.30) Substituting Equation (4.30) into the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, we ﬁnd that the lift per unit span is L/prime=ρ∞V∞/Gamma1=παcρ∞V2 ∞ (4.31) The lift coefﬁcient is cl=L/prime q∞S(4.32) where S=c(1) Substituting Equation (4.31) into (4.32), we have cl=παcρ∞V2 ∞ 1 2ρ∞V2 ∞c(1) or cl=2πα (4.33) and Lift slope =dcl dα=2π (4.34) Equations (4.33) and (4.34) are important results; they state the theoretical re-sult that the lift coefﬁcient is linearly proportional to angle of attack, which is supported by the experimental results discussed in Section 4.3. They also statethat the theoretical lift slope is equal to 2π rad −1, which is 0.11 degree−1. The experimental lift coefﬁcient data for an NACA 0012 symmetric airfoil are givenin Figure 4.25; note that Equation (4.33) accurately predicts c lover a large range of angle of attack. (The NACA 0012 airfoil section is commonly used on airplanetails and helicopter blades.) The moment about the leading edge can be calculated as follows. Consider the elemental vortex of strength γ(ξ) dξlocated a distance ξfrom the leading edge, as sketched in Figure 4.26. The circulation associated with this elementalvortex is d/Gamma1=γ(ξ) dξ. In turn, the increment of lift dLcontributed by the elemental vortex is dL=ρ ∞V∞d/Gamma1. This increment of lift creates a moment about the leading edge dM=−ξ(dL). The total moment about the leading edgeCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 353 Figure 4.25 Comparison between theory and experiment for the lift and moment coefﬁcients for an NACA 0012 airfoil.

Hence, cm,le=M/prime LE q∞c2=−πα 2(4.37) However, from Equation (4.33), πα=cl 2(4.38) Combining Equations (4.37) and (4.38), we obtain cm,le=−cl 4(4.39) From Equation (1.22), the moment coefﬁcient about the quarter-chord point is cm,c/4=cm,le+cl 4(4.40) Combining Equations (4.39) and (4.40), we have cm,c/4=0 (4.41) In Section 1.6, a deﬁnition is given for the center of pressure as that point about which the moments are zero. Clearly, Equation (4.41) demonstrates the theoreticalresult that the center of pressure is at the quarter-chord point for a symmetric airfoil. By the deﬁnition given in Section 4.3, that point on an airfoil where moments are independent of angle of attack is called the aerodynamic center. From Equa-tion (4.41), the moment about the quarter chord is zero for all values of α. Hence, for a symmetric airfoil, we have the theoretical result that the quarter-chord point is both the center of pressure and the aerodynamic center. The theoretical result for c m,c/4=0 in Equation (4.41) is supported by the experimental data given in Figure 4.25. Also, note that the experimental valueofc m,c/4is constant over a wide range of α, thus demonstrating that the real aerodynamic center is essentially at the quarter chord. Let us summarize the above results. The essence of thin airfoil theory is to ﬁnd a distribution of vortex sheet strength along the chord line that will make thecamber line a streamline of the ﬂow while satisfying the Kutta condition γ(TE)= Such a vortex distribution is obtained by solving Equation (4.18) for γ(ξ), or in terms of the transformed independent variable θ, solving Equation (4.23) for γ(θ) [recall that Equation (4.23) is written for a symmetric airfoil]. The resulting vortex distribution γ(θ) for a symmetric airfoil is given by Equation (4.24). In turn, this vortex distribution, when inserted into the Kutta-Joukowski theorem,CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 355 gives the following important theoretical results for a symmetric airfoil: 1.cl=2πα. 2.Lift slope =2π. 3.The center of pressure and the aerodynamic center are both located at the quarter-chord point.

Recall from the discussion in Section 1.6 that the force and moment system can be represented by the lift acting throughany point on the plate, and giving the moment about that point. Here, for convenience, weplace the lift at the quarter-chord point. The lift acts perpendicular to V ∞. [Part of the statement of the Kutta-Joukowski theorem given by Equation (3.140) is that the direction of the force associated with thecirculation /Gamma1is perpendicular to V ∞.] From Figure 4.27, the moment arm from L/primeto the trailing edge is the length a, where a=/parenleftbig3 4c/parenrightbig cosα=/parenleftbig3 4c/parenrightbig cos 5◦ One of the assumptions of thin airfoil theory is that the angle of attack is small, and hencewe can assume that cos α≈1.

To treat the cambered airfoil, returnto Equation (4.18): 1 2π/integraldisplayc 0γ(ξ) dξ x−ξ=V∞/parenleftbigg α−dz dx/parenrightbigg (4.18) For a cambered airfoil, dz/dxis ﬁnite, and this makes the analysis more elaborate than in the case of a symmetric airfoil, where dz/dx=0.

Such a solution for γ(θ) will make the camber line a streamline of the ﬂow. However, as before a rigorous solution of Equation (4.42) forγ(θ) is beyond the scope of this book. Rather, the result is stated below: γ(θ)=2V∞/parenleftBigg A01+cosθ sinθ+∞/summationdisplay n=1Ansinnθ/parenrightBigg (4.43) Note that the above expression for γ(θ) consists of a leading term very similar to Equation (4.24) for a symmetric airfoil, plus a Fourier sine series with coefﬁcients An. The values of Andepend on the shape of the camber line dz/dx, and A0 depends on both dz/dxandα, as shown below. The coefﬁcients A0and An(n=1,2,3,... ) in Equation (4.43) must be speciﬁc values in order that the camber line be a streamline of the ﬂow. To ﬁndthese speciﬁc values, substitute Equations (4.43) into Equation (4.42): 1 π/integraldisplayπ 0A0(1+cosθ)dθ cosθ−cosθ0+1 π∞/summationdisplay n=1/integraldisplayπ 0Ansinnθsinθdθ cosθ−cosθ0=α−dz dx(4.44) The ﬁrst integral can be evaluated from the standard form given in Equation (4.26).The remaining integrals can be obtained from another standard form, which isderived in Appendix E of Reference 9, and which is given below: /integraldisplayπ 0sinnθsinθdθ cosθ−cosθ0=−πcosnθ0 (4.45) Hence, using Equations (4.26) and (4.45), we can reduce Equation (4.44) to A0−∞/summationdisplay n=1Ancosnθ0=α−dz dx ordz dx=(α−A0)+∞/summationdisplay n=1Ancosnθ0 (4.46) Recall that Equation (4.46) was obtained directly from Equation (4.42), whichis the transformed version of the fundamental equation of thin airfoil theory,Equation (4.18). Furthermore, recall that Equation (4.18) is evaluated at a givenpoint xalong the chord line, as sketched in Figure 4.24. Hence, Equation (4.46) is also evaluated at the given point x; here, dz/dxandθ 0correspond to the same point xon the chord line. Also, recall that dz/dx is a function of θ0, where x=(c/2)(1−cosθ0)from Equation (4.21). Examine Equation (4.46) closely. It is in the form of a Fourier cosine se- ries expansion for the function of dz/dx. In general, the Fourier cosine series representation of a function f(θ)over an interval 0 ≤θ≤πis given by f(θ)=B0+∞/summationdisplay n=1Bncosnθ (4.47)358 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow where, from Fourier analysis, the coefﬁcients B0andBnare given by B0=1 π/integraldisplayπ 0f(θ)dθ (4.48) and Bn=2 π/integraldisplayπ 0f(θ)cosnθdθ (4.49) (See, e.g., page 217 of Reference 6.) In Equation (4.46), the function dz/dx is analogous to f(θ)in the general form given in Equation (4.47). Thus, from Equations (4.48) and (4.49), the coefﬁcients in Equation (4.46) are given by α−A0=1 π/integraldisplayπ 0dz dxdθ0 or A0=α−1 π/integraldisplayπ 0dz dxdθ0 (4.50) and An=2 π/integraldisplayπ 0dz dxcosnθ0dθ0 (4.51) Keep in mind that in the above, dz/dx is a function of θ0. Note from Equa- tion (4.50) that A0depends on both αand the shape of the camber line (through dz/dx), whereas from Equation (4.51) the values of Andepend only on the shape of the camber line. Pause for a moment and think about what we have done. We are considering the ﬂow over a cambered airfoil of given shape dz/dxat a given angle of attack α. In order to make the camber line a streamline of the ﬂow, the strength of the vortex sheet along the chord line must have the distribution γ(θ) given by Equa- tion (4.43), where the coefﬁcients A0andAnare given by Equations (4.50) and (4.51), respectively. Also, note that Equation (4.43) satisﬁes the Kutta condition γ(π) =0. Actual numbers for A0and Ancan be obtained for a given shape airfoil at a given angle of attack simply by carrying out the integrations indicatedin Equations (4.50) and (4.51). For an example of such calculations applied to anNACA 23012 airfoil, see Example 4.5 at the end of this section. Also, note thatwhen dz/dx=0, Equation (4.43) reduces to Equation (4.24) for a symmetric airfoil. Hence, the symmetric airfoil is a special case of Equation (4.43). Let us now obtain expressions for the aerodynamic coefﬁcients for a cambered airfoil.

Hence, Equation (4.56) becomes cl=2π/bracketleftbigg α+1 π/integraldisplayπ 0dz dx(cosθ0−1)dθ0/bracketrightbigg (4.57) and Lift slope ≡dcl dα=2π (4.58) Equations (4.57) and (4.58) are important results. Note that, as in the case of the symmetric airfoil, the theoretical lift slope for a cambered airfoil is 2π . It is a general result from thin airfoil theory that dcl/dα=2πfor any shape airfoil. However, the expression for clitself differs between a symmetric and a cambered airfoil, the difference being the integral term in Equation (4.57). This integral term has physical signiﬁcance, as follows. Return to Figure 4.9, whichillustrates the lift curve for an airfoil. The angle of zero lift is denoted by α L=0 and is a negative value. From the geometry shown in Figure 4.9, clearly cl=dcl dα(α−αL=0) (4.59) Substituting Equation (4.58) into (4.59), we have cl=2π(α−αL=0) (4.60)360 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Comparing Equations (4.60) and (4.57), we see that the integral term in Equa- tion (4.57) is simply the negative of the zero-lift angle; that is, αL=0=−1 π/integraldisplayπ 0dz dx(cosθ0−1)dθ0 (4.61) Hence, from Equation (4.61), thin airfoil theory provides a means to predict theangle of zero lift. Note that Equation (4.61) yields α L=0=0 for a symmetric airfoil, which is consistent with the results shown in Figure 4.25. Also, note thatthe more highly cambered the airfoil, the larger will be the absolute magnitudeofα L=0. Returning to Figure 4.26, the moment about the leading edge can be ob- tained by substituting γ(θ) from Equation (4.43) into the transformed version of Equation (4.35). The details are left for Problem 4.9. The result for the momentcoefﬁcient is c m,le=−π 2/parenleftbigg A0+A1−A2 2/parenrightbigg (4.62) Substituting Equation (4.56) into (4.62), we have cm,le=−/bracketleftbiggcl 4+π 4(A1−A2)/bracketrightbigg (4.63) Note that, for dz/dx=0,A1=A2=0 and Equation (4.63) reduces to Equa- tion (4.39) for a symmetric airfoil. The moment coefﬁcient about the quarter chord can be obtained by substi- tuting Equation (4.63) into (4.40), yielding cm,c/4=π 4(A2−A1) (4.64) Unlike the symmetric airfoil, where cm,c/4=0, Equation (4.64) demonstrates that cm,c/4is ﬁnite for a cambered airfoil. Therefore, the quarter chord is notthe center of pressure for a cambered airfoil. However, note that A1andA2depend only on the shape of the camber line and do not involve the angle of attack. Hence, fromEquation (4.64), c m,c/4isindependent ofα. Thus, the quarter-chord point is the theoretical location of the aerodynamic center for a cambered airfoil. The location of the center of pressure can be obtained from Equation (1.21): xcp=−M/prime LE L/prime=−cm,lec cl(4.65) Substituting Equation (4.63) into (4.65), we obtain xcp=c 4/bracketleftbigg 1+π cl(A1−A2)/bracketrightbigg (4.66)CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 361 Equation (4.66) demonstrates that the center of pressure for a cambered airfoil varies with the lift coefﬁcient. Hence, as the angle of attack changes, the centerof pressure also changes. Indeed, as the lift approaches zero, x cpmoves toward inﬁnity; that is, it leaves the airfoil. For this reason, the center of pressure is notalways a convenient point at which to draw the force system on an airfoil. Rather,the force-and-moment system on an airfoil is more conveniently considered atthe aerodynamic center. (Return to Figure 1.25 and the discussion at the end ofSection 1.6 for the referencing of the force-and-moment system on an airfoil.) EXAMPLE 4.6 Consider an NACA 23012 airfoil.

Recall that excellent agreement between thin airfoiltheory for a symmetric airfoil and experimental data has already been shownin Figure 4.25. Hence, all of the work we have done in this section to developthin airfoil theory is certainly worth the effort. Moreover, this illustrates that thedevelopment of thin airfoil theory in the early 1900s was a crowning achievementin theoretical aerodynamics and validates the mathematical approach of replacingthe chord line of the airfoil with a vortex sheet, with the ﬂow tangency conditionevaluated along the mean camber line. This brings to an end our introduction to classical thin airfoil theory. Returning to our road map in Figure 4.7, we have now completed the right-hand branch. 4.9 THE AERODYNAMIC CENTER: ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS The deﬁnition of the aerodynamic center is given in Section 4.3; it is that pointon a body about which the aerodynamically generated moment is independent of angle of attack. At ﬁrst thought, it is hard to imagine that such a point could ex-ist. However, the moment coefﬁcient data in Figure 4.11, which are constantwith angle of attack, experimentally prove the existence of the aerodynamiccenter. Moreover, thin airfoil theory as derived in Sections 4.7 and 4.8 clearlyshows that, within the assumptions embodied in the theory, not only does theaerodynamic center exist but that it is located at the quarter-chord point on theairfoil. Therefore, to Figure 1.24 which illustrates three different ways of stat-ing the force and moment system on an airfoil, we can now add a fourth way,namely, the speciﬁcation of the lift and drag acting through the aerodynamic cen-ter, and the value of the moment about the aerodynamic center. This is illustrated inFigure 4.29. For most conventional airfoils, the aerodynamic center is close to, but not necessarily exactly at, the quarter-chord point. Given data for the shape of the xacM'ac D'L' ac Figure 4.29 Lift, drag, and moments about the aerodynamic center.366 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow c/4 cxacM'c/4L' ac Figure 4.30 Lift and moments about the quarter-chord point, and asketch useful for locatingthe aerodynamic center. lift coefﬁcient curve and the moment coefﬁcient curve taken around an arbitrary point, we can calculate the location of the aerodynamic center as follows. Considerthe lift and moment system taken about the quarter-chord point, as shown inFigure 4.30. We designate the location of the aerodynamic center by c¯x acmeasured from the leading edge. Here, ¯xacis the location of the aerodynamic center as a fraction of the chord length c. Taking moments about the aerodynamic center designated by ac in Figure 4.30, we have M/prime ac=L/prime(c¯xac−c/4)+M/prime c/4 (4.67) Dividing Equation (4.67) by q∞Sc, we have M/prime ac q∞Sc=L/prime q∞S(¯xac−0.25)+M/prime c/4 q∞Sc or cm,ac=cl(¯xac−0.25)+cm,c/4 (4.68) Differentiating Equation (4.68) with respect to angle of attack α, we have dcm,ac dα=dcl dα(¯xac−0.25)+dcm,c/4 dα(4.69) However, in Equation (4.69), dcm,ac/dαis zero by deﬁnition of the aerodynamic center. Hence, Equation (4.69) becomes 0=dcl dα(¯xac−0.25)+dcm,c/4 dα(4.70) For airfoils below the stalling angle of attack, the slopes of the lift coefﬁcient andmoment coefﬁcient curves are constant. Designating these slopes by dc l dα≡a0;dcm,c/4 dα≡m0CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 367 Equation (4.70) becomes 0=a0(¯xac−0.25)+m0 or ¯xac=−m0 a0+0.25 (4.71) Hence, Equation (4.71) proves that, for a body with linear lift and moment curves, that is, where a0andm0are ﬁxed values, the aerodynamic center exists as a ﬁxed point on the airfoil. Moreover, Equation (4.71) allows the calculation of thelocation of this point. EXAMPLE 4.7 Consider the NACA 23012 airfoil studied in Example 4.6. Experimental data for this airfoil is plotted in Figure 4.28, and can be obtained from Reference 11. It shows that, atα=4 ◦,cl=0.55 and cm,c/4=− 0.005. The zero-lift angle of attack is −1.1◦. Also, atα=− 4◦,cm,c/4=− 0.0125. (Note that the “experimental” value of cm,c/4=− 0.01 tabulated at the end of Example 4.6 is an average value over a range of angle of attack.Since the calculated value of c m,c/4from thin airfoil theory states that the quarter-chord point is the aerodynamic center, it makes sense in Example 4.6 to compare the calculatedc m,c/4with an experimental value averaged over a range of angle of attack. However, in the present example, because cm,c/4in reality varies with angle of attack, we use the actual data at two different angles of attack.) From the given information, calculate the locationof the aerodynamic center for the NACA 23012 airfoil. ■Solution Since cl=0.55 at α=4◦andcl=0 atα=−1.1◦, the lift slope is a0=0.55−0 4−(−1.1)=0.1078 per degree The slope of the moment coefﬁcient curve is m0=−0.005 −(−0.0125) 4−(−4)=9.375×10−4per degree From Equation (4.71), ¯xac=−m0 a0+0.25=−9.375×10−4 0.1078+0.25=0.241 The result agrees exactly with the measured value quoted on page 183 of Abbott and V onDoenhoff (Reference 11).368 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow DESIGN BOX The result of Example 4.7 shows that the aerodynamic center for the NACA 23012 airfoil is located ahead of, but very close to, the quarter-chord point. For someother families of airfoils, the aerodynamic center is lo-cated behind, but similarly close to, the quarter-chord point. For a given airfoil family, the location of theaerodynamic center depends on the airfoil thickness,as shown in Figure 4.31. The variation of ¯x acwith thickness for the NACA 230XX family is given inFigure 4.31a. Here, the aerodynamic center is aheadof the quarter-chord point, and becomes progressivelyfarther ahead as the airfoil thickness is increased. Incontrast, the variation of ¯x acwith thickness for the NACA 64-2XX family is given in Figure 4.31b.

From the point of view of purely aerodynamics, the existence of the aerodynamic center is interesting,but the speciﬁcation of the force and moment systemon the airfoil by placing the lift and drag at the aero-dynamic center and giving the value of M /prime acas illus- trated in Figure 4.29, is not more useful than placingthe lift and drag at any other point on the airfoil andgiving the value of M /primeat that point, such as shown in Figure 1.25. However, in ﬂight dynamics, and inparticular the consideration of the stability and con-trol of ﬂight vehicles, placing the lift and drag at, andCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 369 dealing with the moment about, the aerodynamic cen- ter, is particularly convenient. The fact that Macfor a ﬂight vehicle is independent of angle of attack simpli-ﬁes the analysis of the stability and control character-istics, and the use of the aerodynamic center thereforebecomes important in airplane design. In the designprocess, it is important to know where the aerody-namic centers of the various components of the aircraft(wing, tail, fuselage, etc.) are located, and above all thelocation of the aerodynamic center for the completeﬂight vehicle. It is for this reason that we have placedextra emphasis on the aerodynamic center in Sec-tion 4.9. For an introduction to stability and control seeChapter 7 of the author’s book Introduction to Flight, 5th edition, McGraw-Hill, Boston, 2005. For more in-formation about the aerodynamic center, and its usein airplane design, see the author’s book Aircraft Per- formance and Design, McGraw-Hill, Boston, 1999. 4.10 LIFTING FLOWS OVER ARBITRARY BODIES: THE VORTEX PANEL NUMERICAL METHOD The thin airfoil theory described in Sections 4.7 and 4.8 is just what it says—it applies only to thin airfoils at small angles of attack. (Make certain that you under-stand exactly where in the development of thin airfoil theory these assumptionsare made and the reasons for making them.) The advantage of thin airfoil theoryis that closed-form expressions are obtained for the aerodynamic coefﬁcients.Moreover, the results compare favorably with experimental data for airfoils ofabout 12 percent thickness or less. However, the airfoils on many low-speed air-planes are thicker than 12 percent. Moreover, we are frequently interested in highangles of attack, such as occur during takeoff and landing. Finally, we are some-times concerned with the generation of aerodynamic lift on other body shapes,such as automobiles or submarines. Hence, thin airfoil theory is quite restrictivewhen we consider the whole spectrum of aerodynamic applications. We need amethod that allows us to calculate the aerodynamic characteristics of bodies ofarbitrary shape, thickness, and orientation. Such a method is described in thissection. Speciﬁcally, we treat the vortex panel method, which is a numerical tech-nique that has come into widespread use since the early 1970s. In reference toour road map in Figure 4.7, we now move to the left-hand branch. Also, sincethis chapter deals with airfoils, we limit our attention to two-dimensional bodies. The vortex panel method is directly analogous to the source panel method described in Section 3.17. However, because a source has zero circulation, sourcepanels are useful only for nonlifting cases. In contrast, vortices have circulation,and hence vortex panels can be used for lifting cases. (Because of the similaritiesbetween source and vortex panel methods, return to Section 3.17 and review thebasic philosophy of the source panel method before proceeding further.) The philosophy of covering a body surface with a vortex sheet of such a strength to make the surface a streamline of the ﬂow was discussed in Section 4.4.We then went on to simplify this idea by placing the vortex sheet on the camberline of the airfoil as shown in Figure 4.16, thus establishing the basis for thinairfoil theory. We now return to the original idea of wrapping the vortex sheetover the complete surface of the body, as shown in Figure 4.15. We wish to ﬁnd370 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow γ(s)such that the body surface becomes a streamline of the ﬂow. There exists no closed-form analytical solution for γ(s); rather, the solution must be obtained numerically. This is the purpose of the vortex panel method. Let us approximate the vortex sheet shown in Figure 4.15 by a series of straight panels, as shown earlier in Figure 3.40. (In Chapter 3, Figure 3.40 was used to discuss source panels; here, we use the same sketch for discussion ofvortex panels.) Let the vortex strength γ(s)per unit length be constant over a given panel, but allow it to vary from one panel to the next. That is, for thenpanels shown in Figure 3.40, the vortex panel strengths per unit length are γ 1,γ2,...,γ j,...,γ n. These panel strengths are unknowns; the main thrust of the panel technique is to solve for γj,j=1 to n, such that the body surface becomes a streamline of the ﬂow and such that the Kutta condition is satisﬁed.As explained in Section 3.17, the midpoint of each panel is a control point atwhich the boundary condition is applied; that is, at each control point, the normalcomponent of the ﬂow velocity is zero. LetPbe a point located at (x,y)in the ﬂow, and let r pjbe the distance from any point on the jth panel to P, as shown in Figure 3.40. The radius rpjmakes the angle θpjwith respect to the xaxis. The velocity potential induced at Pdue to the jth panel, /Delta1φ j, is, from Equation (4.3), /Delta1φ j=−1 2π/integraldisplay jθpjγjdsj (4.72) In Equation (4.72), γjis constant over the jth panel, and the integral is taken over thejth panel only. The angle θpjis given by θpj=tan−1y−yj x−xj(4.73) In turn, the potential at Pdue to allthe panels is Equation (4.72) summed over all the panels: φ(P)=n/summationdisplay j=1φj=−n/summationdisplay j=1γj 2π/integraldisplay jθpjdsj (4.74) Since point Pis just an arbitrary point in the ﬂow, let us put Pat the control point of the ith panel shown in Figure 3.40. The coordinates of this control point are (xi,yi). Then Equations (4.73) and (4.74) become θij=tan−1yi−yj xi−xj and φ(xi,yi)=−n/summationdisplay j=1γj 2π/integraldisplay jθijdsj (4.75) Equation (4.75) is physically the contribution of allthe panels to the potential at the control point of the ith panel.CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 371 At the control points, the normal component of the velocity is zero; this velocity is the superposition of the uniform ﬂow velocity and the velocity induced by all the vortex panels. The component of V∞normal to the ith panel is given by Equation (3.148): V∞,n=V∞cosβi (3.148) The normal component of velocity induced at (xi,yi)by the vortex panels is Vn=∂ ∂ni[φ(xi,yi)] (4.76) Combining Equations (4.75) and (4.76), we have Vn=−n/summationdisplay j=1γj 2π/integraldisplay j∂θij ∂nidsj (4.77) where the summation is over all the panels. The normal component of the ﬂowvelocity at the ith control point is the sum of that due to the freestream [Equa- tion (3.148)] and that due to the vortex panels [Equation (4.77)]. The boundarycondition states that this sum must be zero: V ∞,n+Vn=0 (4.78) Substituting Equations (3.148) and (4.77) into (4.78), we obtain V∞cosβi−n/summationdisplay j=1γj 2π/integraldisplay j∂θij ∂nidsj=0 (4.79) Equation (4.79) is the crux of the vortex panel method. The values of the integralsin Equation (4.79) depend simply on the panel geometry; they are not propertiesof the ﬂow. Let J i,jbe the value of this integral when the control point is on the ith panel. Then Equation (4.79) can be written as V∞cosβi−n/summationdisplay j=1γj 2πJi,j=0 (4.80) Equation (4.80) is a linear algebraic equation with nunknowns, γ1,γ2,...,γ n. It represents the ﬂow boundary condition evaluated at the control point of the ith panel. If Equation (4.80) is applied to the control points of allthe panels, we obtain a system of nlinear equations with nunknowns. To this point, we have been deliberately paralleling the discussion of the source panel method given in Section 3.17; however, the similarity stops here. Forthe source panel method, the nequations for the nunknown source strengths are routinely solved, giving the ﬂow over a nonlifting body. In contrast, for the liftingcase with vortex panels, in addition to the nequations given by Equation (4.80) applied at all the panels, we must also satisfy the Kutta condition. This can bedone in several ways. For example, consider Figure 4.32, which illustrates a detailof the vortex panel distribution at the trailing edge. Note that the length of each372 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 4.32 V ortex panels at the trailing edge. Figure 4.33 Airfoil as a solid body, with zero velocity inside the proﬁle. panel can be different; their length and distribution over the body are up to your discretion. Let the two panels at the trailing edge (panels iandi−1 in Figure 4.32) be very small. The Kutta condition is applied precisely at the trailing edge and is given by γ(TE)=0. To approximate this numerically, if points iandi−1 are close enough to the trailing edge, we can write γi=−γi−1 (4.81) such that the strengths of the two vortex panels iandi−1 exactly cancel at the point where they touch at the trailing edge. Thus, in order to impose theKutta condition on the solution of the ﬂow, Equation (4.81) (or an equivalentexpression) must be included. Note that Equation (4.80) evaluated at all the panelsand Equation (4.81) constitute an overdetermined system of nunknowns with n+1 equations. Therefore, to obtain a determined system, Equation (4.80) is not evaluated at one of the control points on the body. That is, we choose to ignoreone of the control points, and we evaluate Equation (4.80) at the other n−1 control points. This, in combination with Equation (4.81), now gives a system ofnlinear algebraic equations with nunknowns, which can be solved by standard techniques. At this stage, we have conceptually obtained the values of γ 1,γ2,...,γ n which make the body surface a streamline of the ﬂow and which also satisfythe Kutta condition. In turn, the ﬂow velocity tangent to the surface can be ob-tained directly from γ. To see this more clearly, consider the airfoil shown in Figure 4.33. We are concerned only with the ﬂow outside the airfoil and on itssurface. Therefore, let the velocity be zero at every point inside the body, as shown in Figure 4.33. In particular, the velocity just inside the vortex sheet on the surfaceCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 373 is zero. This corresponds to u2=0 in Equation (4.8). Hence, the velocity just outside the vortex sheet is, from Equation (4.8), γ=u1−u2=u1−0=u1 In Equation (4.8), udenotes the velocity tangential to the vortex sheet. In terms of the picture shown in Figure 4.33, we obtain Va=γaat point a,Vb=γbat point b, etc. Therefore, the local velocities tangential to the airfoil surface are equal to the local values of γ. In turn, the local pressure distribution can be obtained from Bernoulli’s equation. The total circulation and the resulting lift are obtained as follows. Let sjbe the length of the jth panel. Then the circulation due to the jth panel is γjsj. In turn, the total circulation due to all the panels is /Gamma1=n/summationdisplay j=1γjsj (4.82) Hence, the lift per unit span is obtained from L/prime=ρ∞V∞n/summationdisplay j=1γjsj (4.83) The presentation in this section is intended to give only the general ﬂavor of the vortex panel method. There are many variations of the method in use today, and you are encouraged to read the modern literature, especially as it appears intheAIAA Journal and the Journal of Aircraft since 1970. The vortex panel method as described in this section is termed a “ﬁrst-order” method because it assumesa constant value of γover a given panel. Although the method may appear to be straightforward, its numerical implementation can sometimes be frustrating. Forexample, the results for a given body are sensitive to the number of panels used,their various sizes, and the way they are distributed over the body surface (i.e., it isusually advantageous to place a large number of small panels near the leading andtrailing edges of an airfoil and a smaller number of larger panels in the middle).The need to ignore one of the control points in order to have a determined systeminnequations for nunknowns also introduces some arbitrariness in the numerical solution. Which control point do you ignore? Different choices sometimes yielddifferent numerical answers for the distribution of γover the surface. Moreover, the resulting numerical distributions for γare not always smooth, but rather, they have oscillations from one panel to the next as a result of numerical inaccura-cies. The problems mentioned above are usually overcome in different ways bydifferent groups who have developed relatively sophisticated panel programs forpractical use. For example, what is more common today is to use a combination of both source and vortex panels (source panels to basically simulate the airfoilthickness and vortex panels to introduce circulation) in a panel solution. Thiscombination helps to mitigate some of the practical numerical problems just dis-cussed. Again, you are encouraged to consult the literature for more information.374 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Control pointBoundary points/H92532/H92531 /H92533 /H92534 Figure 4.34 Linear distribution of γover each panel—a second-order panel method. Figure 4.35 Pressure coefﬁcient distribution over an NACA 0012 airfoil; comparison between second-order vortex panel method and NACA theoretical results from Reference 11. The numerical panel results were obtained by one of the author’s graduate students,Dr. Tae-Hwan Cho. Such accuracy problems have also encouraged the development of higher- order panel techniques. For example, a “second-order” panel method assumes a linear variation of γover a given panel, as sketched in Figure 4.34. Here, the value of γat the edges of each panel is matched to its neighbors, and the values γ1,γ2,γ3, etc. at the boundary points become the unknowns to be solved. The ﬂow-tangency boundary condition is still applied at the control point of each panel, as before. Some results using a second-order vortex panel technique areCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 375 given in Figure 4.35, which shows the distribution of pressure coefﬁcients over the upper and lower surfaces of an NACA 0012 airfoil at a 9◦angle of attack. The circles and squares are numerical results from a second-order vortex paneltechnique developed at the University of Maryland, and the solid lines are fromNACA results given in Reference 11. Excellent agreement is obtained. Again, you are encouraged to consult the literature before embarking on any serious panel solutions of your own. For example, Reference 14 is a classic paperon panel methods, and Reference 15 highlights many of the basic concepts ofpanel methods along with actual computer program statement listings for simpleapplications. Reference 62 is a modern compilation of papers, several of whichdeal with current panel techniques. Finally, Katz and Plotkin (Reference 63) giveperhaps the most thorough discussion of panel techniques and their foundationsto date. 4.11 MODERN LOW-SPEED AIRFOILS The nomenclature and aerodynamic characteristics of standard NACA airfoils arediscussed in Sections 4.2 and 4.3; before progressing further, you should reviewthese sections in order to reinforce your knowledge of airfoil behavior, especiallyin light of our discussions on airfoil theory. Indeed, the purpose of this section isto provide a modern sequel to the airfoils discussed in Sections 4.2 and 4.3. During the 1970s, NASA designed a series of low-speed airfoils that have performance superior to the earlier NACA airfoils. The standard NACA airfoilswere based almost exclusively on experimental data obtained during the 1930sand 1940s. In contrast, the new NASA airfoils were designed on a computer usinga numerical technique similar to the source and vortex panel methods discussedearlier, along with numerical predictions of the viscous ﬂow behavior (skin fric-tion and ﬂow separation). Wind-tunnel tests were then conducted to verify thecomputer-designed proﬁles and to obtain the deﬁnitive airfoil properties. Out ofthis work ﬁrst came the general aviation–Whitcomb [GA(W)-1] airfoil, which hassince been redesignated the LS(1)-0417 airfoil. The shape of this airfoil is givenin Figure 4.36, obtained from Reference 16. Note that it has a large leading-edgeradius (0.08c in comparison to the standard 0.02c ) in order to ﬂatten the usual peak in pressure coefﬁcient near the nose. Also, note that the bottom surface near thetrailing edge is cusped in order to increase the camber and hence the aerodynamic Figure 4.36 Proﬁle for the NASA LS(1)-0417 airfoil. When ﬁrst introduced, this airfoil was labeled the GA(W)-1 airfoil, a nomenclature which has now been superseded. (FromMcGhee, R. J., and W. D. Beasley: Low-Speed Aerodynamic Characteristics of a 17-Percent-Thick Airfoil SectionDesigned for General Aviation Applications, NASA TND-7428, December 1973.)376 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 4.37 Comparison of the modern NASA LS(1)-0417 airfoil with the standard NACA 2412 airfoil. loading in that region. Both design features tend to discourage ﬂow separation over the top surface at high angle of attack, hence yielding higher values of themaximum lift coefﬁcient. The experimentally measured lift and moment proper-ties (from Reference 16) are given in Figure 4.37, where they are compared withthe properties for an NACA 2412 airfoil, obtained from Reference 11. Note thatc l,maxfor the NASA LS(1)-0417 is considerably higher than for the NACA 2412. The NASA LS(1)-0417 airfoil has a maximum thickness of 17 percent and a design lift coefﬁcient of 0.4. Using the same camber line, NASA has extended thisairfoil into a family of low-speed airfoils of different thicknesses, for example, theNASA LS(1)-0409 and the LS(1)-0413. (See Reference 17 for more details.) Incomparison with the standard NACA airfoils having the same thicknesses, thesenew LS(1)-04xx airfoils all have: 1.Approximately 30 percent higher c l,max. 2.Approximately a 50 percent increase in the ratio of lift to drag (L/D)at a lift coefﬁcient of 1.0. This value of cl=1.0 is typical of the climb lift coefﬁcient for general aviation aircraft, and a high value of L/Dgreatly improves the climb performance. (See Reference 2 for a generalCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 377 introduction to airplane performance and the importance of a high L/D ratio to airplane efﬁciency.) It is interesting to note that the shape of the airfoil in Figure 4.36 is very similar to the supercritical airfoils to be discussed in Chapter 11. The development of the supercritical airfoil by NASA aerodynamicist Richard Whitcomb in 1965 resultedin a major improvement in airfoil drag behavior at high subsonic speeds, nearMach 1. The supercritical airfoil was a major breakthrough in high-speed aerody-namics. The LS(1)-0417 low-speed airfoil shown in Figure 4.36, ﬁrst introducedas the GA(W)-1 airfoil, was a later spin-off from supercritical airfoil research.It is also interesting to note that the ﬁrst production aircraft to use the NASALS(1)-0417 airfoil was the Piper PA-38 Tomahawk, introduced in the late 1970s. In summary, new airfoil development is alive and well in the aeronautics of the late twentieth century. Moreover, in contrast to the purely experimentaldevelopment of the earlier airfoils, we now enjoy the beneﬁt of powerful computerprograms using panel methods and advanced viscous ﬂow solutions for the designof new airfoils. Indeed, in the 1980s NASA established an ofﬁcial Airfoil DesignCenter at The Ohio State University, which services the entire general aviationindustry with over 30 different computer programs for airfoil design and analysis.For additional information on such new low-speed airfoil development, you areurged to read Reference 16, which is the classic ﬁrst publication dealing withthese airfoils, as well as the concise review given in Reference 17. DESIGN BOX This chapter deals with incompressible ﬂow over airfoils. Moreover, the analytical thin airfoil theoryand the numerical panel methods discussed here aretechniques for calculating the aerodynamic charac-teristics for a given airfoil of speciﬁed shape. Such an approach is frequently called the direct problem, wherein the shape of the body is given, and the sur-face pressure distribution (for example) is calculated.For design purposes, it is desirable to turn this pro-cess inside-out; it is desirable to specify the surfacepressure distribution—a pressure distribution that willachieve enhanced airfoil performance—and calculatethe shape of the airfoil that will produce the spec-iﬁed pressure distribution. This approach is calledtheinverse problem. Before the advent of the high- speed digital computer, and the concurrent rise ofthe discipline of computational ﬂuid dynamics in the1970s (see Section 2.17.2), the analytical solutionof the inverse problem was difﬁcult, and was notused by the practical airplane designer. Instead, formost of the airplanes designed before and during thetwentieth century, the choice of an airfoil shape wasbased on reasonable experimental data (at best), andguesswork (at worst). This story is told in some de-tail in Reference 58. The design problem was mademore comfortable with the introduction of the vari-ous families of NACA airfoils, beginning in the early1930s. A logical method was used for the geomet-rical design of these airfoils, and deﬁnitive experi-mental data on the NACA airfoils were made avail-able (such as shown in Figures 4.10, 4.11, and 4.28).For this reason, many airplanes designed during themiddle of the twentieth century used standard NACAairfoil sections. Even today, the NACA airfoils aresometimes the most expeditious choice of the air-plane designer, as indicated by the tabulation (by nomeans complete) in Section 4.2 of airplanes using suchairfoils.378 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 4.38 Unstructured mesh for the numerical calculation of the ﬂow over an airfoil. (Data Source: Anderson, W. Kyle, and Bonhaus, Daryl L.: “Airfoil Design on Unstructured Grids for Turbulent Flows,” AIAA J., vol. 37, no. 2, Feb. 1999, pp. 185–191.) However, today the power of computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) is revolutionizing airfoil design and analysis. The inverse problem, and indeed the nextstep—the overall automated procedure that results ina completely optimized airfoil shape for a given designpoint—are being made tractable by CFD. An exampleof such work is illustrated in Figures 4.38 and 4.39,taken from the recent work of Kyle Anderson andDaryl Bonhaus (Reference 64). Here, CFD solutionsof the continuity, momentum, and energy equationsfor a compressible, viscous ﬂow (the Navier-Stokesequations, as denoted in Section 2.17.2) are carriedout for the purpose of airfoil design. Using a ﬁnitevolume CFD technique, and the grid shown in Fig-ure 4.38, the inverse problem is solved. The speciﬁed pressure distribution over the top and bottom surfacesof the airfoil is given by the circles in Figure 4.39a. Theoptimization technique is iterative and requires start-ing with a pressure distribution that is not the desired,speciﬁed one; the initial distribution is given by thesolid curves in Figure 4.39a, and the airfoil shape cor-responding to this initial pressure distribution is shownby the solid curve in Figure 4.39b. (In Figure 4.39b,the airfoil shape appears distorted because an ex-panded scale is used for the ordinate.) After 10 de-sign cycles, the optimized airfoil shape that supportsCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 379 Initial Current Target 1.51.00.50.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0–0.5–1.0 –0.10–0.050.000.050.10 –1.5–2.0–2.5 x/c0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 x/cy/cCp (a) Pressure coefficient distributions (b) Airfoil shapes Figure 4.39 An example of airfoil optimized design using computational ﬂuid dynamics.

The initial airfoil shapeis also shown in constant scale in Figure 4.38. The results given in Figures 4.38 and 4.39 are shown here simply to provide the ﬂavor of modern air-foil design and analysis. This is reﬂective of the waveof future airfoil design procedures, and you are en-couraged to read the contemporary literature in orderto keep up with this rapidly evolving ﬁeld. However,keep in mind that the simpler analytical approach ofthin airfoil theory discussed in the present chapter, andespecially the simple practical results of this theory,will continue to be part of the whole “toolbox” of pro-cedures to be used by the designer in the future. Thefundamentals embodied in thin airfoil theory will con-tinue to be part of the fundamentals of aerodynamicsand will always be there as a partner with the modernCFD techniques. 4.12 VISCOUS FLOW: AIRFOIL DRAG This is another “stand-alone” viscous ﬂow section in the same spirit as Sec- tion 1.11. It does not break the continuity of our discussions on inviscid ﬂow;rather, it is designed to complement them. Before reading further, you are en-couraged to review the introduction to boundary layers given in Section 1.11. The lift on an airfoil is primarily due to the pressure distribution exerted on its surface; the shear stress distribution acting on the airfoil, when integrated in thelift direction, is usually negligible. The lift, therefore, can be accurately calculatedassuming inviscid ﬂow in conjunction with the Kutta condition at the trailing edge.When used to predict drag, however, this same approach yields zero drag, a resultthat goes against common sense, and is called d’Alembert’s paradox after Jean le Rond d’Alembert, the eighteenth-century French mathematician and scientistwho ﬁrst made such drag calculations for inviscid ﬂows over two-dimensionalbodies (see Sections 3.13 and 3.20).380 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Separated flow (b)(a)/H9270w /H9270w /H9270w/H9270w/H9270w/H9270w Figure 4.40 Subsonic airfoil drag is due to two components: (a)shear stress acting on the surface, and (b)pressure drag due to ﬂow separation. Figure 4.41 Estimation of skin-friction drag on an airfoil from that on a ﬂat plate. The paradox is immediately removed when viscosity (friction) is included in the ﬂow. Indeed, viscosity in the ﬂow is totally responsible for the aerodynamic drag on an airfoil. It acts through two mechanisms: 1.Skin-friction drag, due to the shear stress acting on the surface (Figure 4.40 a), and 2.Pressure drag due to ﬂow separation, sometimes called form drag (Figure 4.40b ). That shear stress creates drag is self-evident from Figure 4.40 a. The pressure drag created by ﬂow separation (Figure 4.40b ) is a more subtle phenomenon and will be discussed toward the end of this section. 4.12.1 Estimating Skin-Friction Drag: Laminar Flow As a ﬁrst approximation, we assume that skin-friction drag on an airfoil is essen- tially the same as the skin-friction drag on a ﬂat plate at zero angle of attack, asillustrated in Figure 4.41. Obviously, this approximation becomes more accuratethe thinner the airfoil and the smaller the angle of attack. Consistent with the restof this chapter, we will continue to deal with low-speed incompressible ﬂow.CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 381 x cD V/H11009/H9254 Figure 4.42 Total friction drag on a ﬂat plate. We ﬁrst deal with the case of completely laminar ﬂow over the airfoil (and hence the ﬂat plate) in Figure 4.41. There is an exact analytical solution for the laminar boundary-layer ﬂow over a ﬂat plate. The details of this solution are givenin Section 18.2, where we present boundary-layer theory in some detail. For thepresent section, we will use just the results of Section 18.2. The boundary-layer thickness for incompressible laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate at zero angle of attack is given by Equation (18.23), repeated and renumberedbelow: δ=5.0x √Rex(4.84) where Re xis the Reynolds number based on distance xmeasured from the leading edge (Figure 4.42), Rex=ρeV∞x μ∞ Note from Equation (4.84) that δ∝√x, that is, the boundary-layer thickness grows parabolically with distance from the leading edge. The local shear stress, integrated over both the top and bottom surfaces of the ﬂat plate shown in Figure 4.41, yields the net friction drag, Df, on the plate, illustrated in Figure 4.42. To begin with, however, let us consider just onesurface of the plate, either the top surface or the bottom surface. The shear stress distri-bution over the top surface is the same as that over the bottom surface. Let uschoose the top surface. The integral of the shear stress over the top surface givesthe net friction drag on that surface, D f,top. Clearly, the net friction drag due to the shear stress integrated over the bottom surface, Df,bottom , is the same value, Df,bottom=Df,top. Hence, the total skin friction drag, Df, is Df=2Df,top=2Df,bottom Deﬁne the skin-friction drag coefﬁcient for the ﬂow over onesurface as Cf≡Df,top q∞S=Df,bottom q∞S(4.85) The skin-friction drag coefﬁcient is a function of the Reynolds number, and isgiven by Equation (18.22), repeated and renumbered below, C f=1.328√Rec(4.86)382 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow where Re cis the Reynolds number based on the chord length cshown in Fig- ure 4.42 Rec=ρ∞V∞c μ∞ EXAMPLE 4.8 Consider the NACA 2412 airfoil, data for which is given in Figures 4.10 and 4.11. The data are given for two values of the Reynolds number based on chord length. For the casewhere Re c=3.1×106, estimate: (a)the laminar boundary layer thickness at the trailing edge for a chord length of 1.5 m and (b)the net laminar skin-friction drag coefﬁcient for the airfoil. ■Solution (a)From Equation (4.84) applied at the trailing edge, where x=c, we have δ=5.0c√Rec=(5.0)(1.5)√ 3.1×106=0.00426 m Notice how thin the boundary layer is; at the trailing edge, where its thickness is thelargest, the boundary layer is only 0.426 cm thick.(b)From Equation (4.86), C f=1.328√Rec=1.328√ 3.1×106=7.54×10−4 Recall that the above result is for a single surface, either the top or bottom of the plate.Taking both surfaces into account: NetC f=2(7.54 ×10−4)=0.0015 From the data in Figure 4.11, we see that at zero angle of attack for Re =3.1×106, the airfoil drag coefﬁcient is 0.0068. This measured value is about 4.5 times higher than the value of 0.0015 we just calculated. But wait a moment! For the relativelyhigh Reynolds number of 3.1 ×10 6, the boundary layer over the airfoil will beturbulent, not laminar. So our laminar ﬂow calculation is not an appropriate estimate for the boundary layer thickness and the airfoil drag coefﬁcient. Let ustake the next step. 4.12.2 Estimating Skin-Friction Drag: Turbulent Flow In contrast to the situation for laminar ﬂow, there are no exact analytical solutionsfor turbulent ﬂow. This sad state of affairs is discussed in Chapter 19. The analysisof any turbulent ﬂow requires some amount of empirical data. All analyses ofturbulent ﬂow are approximate. The analysis of the turbulent boundary layer over a ﬂat plate is no excep- tion. From Chapter 19 we lift the following approximate results for the incom-pressible turbulent ﬂow over a ﬂat plate. From Equation (19.1) repeated andCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 383 renumbered below: δ=0.37x Re1/5 x(4.87) and from Equation (19.2) repeated and renumbered below: Cf=0.074 Re1/5 c(4.88) We emphasize again that Equations (4.87) and (4.88) are only approximate results, and they represent only one set of results among a myriad of different turbulentﬂow analyses for the ﬂat plate boundary layer. Nevertheless, Equations (4.87) and(4.88) give us some reasonable means to estimate the boundary-layer thicknessand skin-friction drag coefﬁcient for turbulent ﬂow. Note that, in contrast to theinverse square root variation with Reynolds number for laminar ﬂow, the turbulentﬂow results show an inverse ﬁfth root variation with Reynolds number. EXAMPLE 4.9 Repeat Example 4.8 assuming a turbulent boundary layer over the airfoil. ■Solution Once again we replace the airfoil with a ﬂat plate at zero angle of attack. (a)The boundary-layer thickness at the trailing edge, where x=cand Re x=Rec= 3.1×106, is given by Equation (4.87): δ=0.37x Re1/5 x=0.37(1.5) (3.1×106)1/5=0.0279 m The turbulent boundary layer is still thin, 2.79 cm at the trailing edge, but by comparison is much thicker than the laminar boundary layer thickness of 0.426 cm from Example 4.8. (b)The skin-friction drag coefﬁcient (based on one side of the ﬂat plate) is given by Equation (4.88): Cf=0.074 Re1/5 c=0.074 (3.1×106)1/5=0.00372 The net skin-friction drag coefﬁcient, taking into account both the top and bottom surfaces of the ﬂat plate, is NetCf=2(0.00372) =0.00744 This result is a factor of ﬁve larger than for the laminar boundary layer, and serves as anillustration of the considerable increase in skin friction caused by a turbulent boundarylayer in comparison to that caused by a laminar boundary layer. The result for the skin friction drag coefﬁcient in Example 4.9 is larger than the measured drag coefﬁcient of the airfoil of 0.0068, which is the sum of both384 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow skin friction drag and pressure drag due to ﬂow separation. So our result in this example clearly overestimates the skin friction drag coefﬁcient for the airfoil. Butwait a minute! In actuality, the boundary layer over a body always starts out asalaminar boundary for some distance from the leading edge, and then transists to a turbulent boundary layer at some point downstream of the leading edge. Theskin-friction drag is therefore a combination of laminar skin friction over theforward part of the airfoil, and turbulent skin friction over the remaining part. Letus examine this situation. 4.12.3 Transition In Section 4.12.1 we assumed that the ﬂow over a ﬂat plate was all laminar.Similarly, in Section 4.12.2 we assumed all turbulent ﬂow. In reality, the ﬂowalways starts out from the leading edge as laminar. Then at some point downstream of the leading edge, the laminar boundary layer becomes unstable and small“bursts” of turbulence begin to grow in the ﬂow. Finally, over a certain regioncalled the transition region, the boundary layer becomes completely turbulent. For purposes of analysis, we usually draw the picture shown in Figure 4.43,where a laminar boundary layer starts out from the leading edge of the ﬂat plateand grows parabolically downstream. Then at the transition point, it becomes a turbulent boundary layer growing at a faster rate, on the order of x 4/5downstream. The value of xwhere transition is said to take place is the critical value xcr. In turn, xcrallows the deﬁnition of a critical Reynolds number for transition as Rexcr=ρ∞V∞xcr μ∞(4.89) Transition is discussed in more detail in Section 15.2. V olumes of literature have been written on the phenomenon of transition from laminar to turbulentﬂow. Obviously, because τ wis different for the two ﬂows—as clearly illustrated by comparing the results of Examples 4.8 and 4.9—knowledge of where on thesurface transition occurs is vital to an accurate prediction of skin friction drag.The location of the transition point (in reality, a ﬁnite region) depends on manyquantities as discussed in Section 15.2. However, if the critical Reynolds numberis given to you (usually from experiments for a given type of ﬂow over a given xcrLaminarTurbulentTransition V/H11009 Figure 4.43 Transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow. The boundary layer thickness is exaggerated for clarity.CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 385 body), then the location of transition, xcr, for that type of ﬂow can be obtained directly from the deﬁnition, Equation (4.89). For example, assume that you have an airfoil of given surface roughness (one of the factors that affect the location of transition) in a ﬂow at a freestream velocity of 50 m/s and you wish to predict how far from the leading edge the transitionwill take place. After searching through the literature for low-speed ﬂows oversuch surfaces, you may ﬁnd that the critical Reynolds number determined fromexperience is approximately Re xcr=5×105. Applying this “experience” to your problem, using Equation (4.89), and assuming the thermodynamic conditionscorrespond to standard sea level, where ρ ∞=1.23 kg/m3and (from Section 1.11) μ∞=1.789×10−5kg/(m)(s), you ﬁnd xcr=μ∞Rexcr ρ∞V∞=(1.789 ×10−5)(5×105) (1.23)(50)=0.145 m Note that the region of laminar ﬂow in this example extends from the leading edgeto 14.5 cm downstream from the leading edge. If now you double the freestreamvelocity to 100 m/s, the transition point is still governed by the critical Reynoldsnumber, Re xcr=5×105. Thus, xcr=(1.789 ×10−5)(5×105) (1.23)(100)=0.0727 m Hence, when the velocity is doubled, the transition point moves forward one-halfthe distance to the leading edge. In summary, once you know the critical Reynolds number, you can ﬁnd x cr from Equation (4.89). However, an accurate value for Re xcrapplicable to your problem must come from somewhere—experiment, free ﬂight, or some semi-empirical theory—and this may be difﬁcult to obtain. This situation provides alittle insight into why basic studies of transition and turbulence are needed toadvance our understanding of such ﬂows and to allow us to apply more validreasoning to the prediction of transition in practical problems. EXAMPLE 4.10 For the NACA 2412 airfoil and the conditions in Example 4.7, calculate the net skin friction drag coefﬁcient assuming that the critical Reynolds number is 500,000. ■Solution Consider Figure 4.44, which shows a ﬂat plate with a laminar boundary layer extendingfrom the leading edge over the distance x 1to the transition point (region 1), and a turbulent boundary extending over the distance x2from the transition point to the trailing edge (region 2).

Hence Rexcr=ρ∞V∞x1 μ∞=5×105 The Reynolds number based on chord length is given as Rec=ρ∞V∞c μ∞=3.1×106 Thus Rexcr Rec=5×105 3.1×106=0.1613 =(ρ∞V∞x1/μ∞) (ρ∞V∞c/μ∞)=x1 c This locates the transition point relative to the chord length, that is, in Figure 4.44, we have x1 c=0.1613 Because the Reynolds number in the equations for skin friction drag coefﬁcient is always based on length measured from the leading edge, we cannot simply calculate the turbulent skin friction drag coefﬁcient for region 2 by using Equation (4.88) with aReynolds number based on x Rather, we must carry out the following procedure. Assuming all turbulent ﬂow over the entire length of the plate, the drag (on one side of the plate) is (Df,c)turbulent , where (Df,c)turbulent =q∞S(Cf,c)turbulent As usual, we are dealing with the drag per unit span, hence S=c(1). (Df,c)turbulent =q∞c(Cf,c)turbulent The turbulent drag on just region 1 is ( Df,1)turbulent : (Df,1)turbulent =q∞S(Cf,1)turbulent Here, S=(x1)(1): (Df,1)turbulent =q∞x1(Cf,1)turbulentCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 387 Thus, the turbulent drag just on region 2, (Df,2)turbulent , is (Df,2)turbulent =(Df,c)turbulent −(Df,1)turbulent (Df,2)turbulent =q∞c(Cf,c)turbulent −q∞x1(Cf,1)turbulent The laminar drag on region 1 is (Df,1)laminar (Df,1)laminar =q∞S(Cf,1)laminar =q∞x1(Cf,1)laminar The total skin-friction drag on the plate, Df, is then Df=(Df,1)laminar +(Df,2)turbulent or, Df=q∞x1(Cf,1)laminar +q∞c(Cf,c)turbulent −q∞x1(Cf,1)turbulent (4.90) The total skin-friction drag coefﬁcient is Cf=Df q∞S=Df q∞c(4.91) Combining Equations (4.90) and (4.91): Cf=x1 c(Cf,1)laminar +(Cf,c)turbulent −x1 c(Cf,1)turbulent (4.92) Since x1/c=0.1613, Equation (4.92) becomes Cf=0.1613( Cf,1)laminar +(Cf,c)turbulent −0.1613( Cf,1)turbulent (4.93) The various skin friction drag coefﬁcients in Equation (4.93) are obtained as follows. The Reynolds number for region 1 is Rex1=ρ∞V∞x1 μ∞=x1 c/parenleftbiggρ∞V∞c μ∞/parenrightbigg =x1 cRec=0.1613 (3.1×106)=5×105 (Of course, we could have written this down directly because x=x1is the transition point, determined from the critical Reynolds number that is given as 5 ×105.) From Equation (4.86) for laminar ﬂow, with the Reynolds number based on x1, we have (Cf,1)laminar =1.328/radicalbig Rex1=1.328√ 5×105=0.00188 The value of (Cf,c)turbulent has already been calculated in Example 4.8, namely, (Cf,c)turbulent =0.00372 (for one side) From Equation (4.88) with the Reynolds number based on x1, (Cf,1)turbulent =0.074 Re1/5 x1=0.074 (5×105)0.2=0.00536 Inserting these values into Equation (4.93), we have Cf=0.1613(0.00188) +0.00372 −0.1613(0.00536) =0.003158 Taking into account both sides of the ﬂat plate, NetCf=2(0.003158) =0.0063388 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow From the data in Figure 4.11, the measured airfoil drag coefﬁcient is 0.0068, which includes both skin friction drag and pressure drag due to ﬂow separation. The result from Example 4.10, therefore, is qualitatively reasonable, giving a skin frictiondrag coefﬁcient slightly less than the measured total drag coefﬁcient. However,our calculated result of C f= 0.0063 is for a critical Reynolds number of 500,000 for transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow. We do not know what the criticalReynolds number is for the experiments on which the data in Figure 4.11 arebased. In Example 4.10, the assumption of Re xcr=500,000 is very conservative; more likely the actual value is closer to 1,000,000. If we assume this higher valueof Re xcr, what does it do to the calculated result for Cf? Let us take a look. EXAMPLE 4.11 Repeat Example 4.10, but assuming the critical Reynolds number is 1 ×106. ■Solution x1 c=1×106 3.1×106=0.3226 Which, as we could write down immediately, is twice the length from Example 4.10 because the critical Reynolds number is twice as large. Equation (4.93) becomes Cf=0.3226( Cf,1)laminar +(Cf,c)turbulent −0.3226( Cf,1)turbulent (4.94) For region 1, we have (Cf,1)laminar =1.328/radicalbig Rex1=1.328√ 1×106=0.001328 The value of (Cf,c)turbulent is the same as before: (Cf,c)turbulent =0.00372 Once again, for region 1 assuming turbulent ﬂow, we have (Cf,1)turbulent =0.074 (Re x1)1/5=0.074 (1×106)1/5=0.004669 Substituting the above results in Equation (4.94), we have Cf=0.3226(0.001328) +0.00372 −0.3226(0.004669) =0.002642 Since this result is for one side of the plate, the net skin friction drag coefﬁcient is NetCf=2(0.002642) =0.00528 Note: Comparing the results from Examples 4.10 and 4.11, we see that an increase in Re xcrfrom 500,000 to 1,000,000 resulted in a skin friction drag co- efﬁcient that is 16 percent smaller. This difference underscores the importance of knowing where transition takes place on a surface for the calculation of skinfriction drag.CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 389 Also, comparing the calculated results for skin friction drag coefﬁcient with the measured total drag coefﬁcient of 0.0068, from Example 4.10 the calculated Cf=0.0063 would imply that the pressure drag due to ﬂow separation is about 7.4 percent of the total drag. The result from Example 4.11 of Cf=0.00528 would imply that the pressure drag due to ﬂow separation is about 22 percent of the total drag. Is this breakdown between skin friction and pressure drag quantitatively reasonable? An answer can be found in the recent results of Lombardi et al. given in Reference 88. Here, the authors calculated both the skin friction dragcoefﬁcient and the total drag coefﬁcient for an NACA 0012 airfoil using anaccurate computational ﬂuid dynamic technique. More details of their calculationsare given in Section 20.4. For a Reynolds number based on chord length of 3 ×10 6, and including a model for transition, they calculated a total drag coefﬁcient of0.00623 and a skin friction drag coefﬁcient of 0.00534, indicating that the pressuredrag due to ﬂow separation is 15 percent of the total drag. For a streamlined body,this drag breakdown is reasonable; the drag on a streamlined two-dimensionalshape is mostly skin friction drag, and by comparison the pressure drag is small.For example, it is reasonable to expect 80 percent of the drag to be skin frictiondrag and 20 percent to be pressure drag due to ﬂow separation. This is not to say that pressure drag due to ﬂow separation is unimportant; quite the contrary, as the body becomes less streamlined (more like a blunt body),the pressure drag becomes the dominant factor. We need to take a closer look atthis phenomenon. 4.12.4 Flow Separation Pressure drag on an airfoil is caused by the ﬂow separation. For a completelyattached ﬂow over an airfoil, the pressure acting on the rear surface gives rise toa force in the forward direction which completely counteracts the pressure actingon the front surface producing a force in the rearward direction, resulting in zeropressure drag. However, if the ﬂow is partially separated over the rear surface,the pressure on the rear surface pushing forward will be smaller than the fullyattached case, and the pressure acting on the front surface pushing backwards willnot be fully counteracted, giving rise to a net pressure drag on the airfoil—thepressure drag due to ﬂow separation. What ﬂow conditions are conducive to ﬂow separation? To help answer this question, consider the ﬂow over the NASA LS(1)-0417 airfoil at zero angle ofattack, as shown in Figure 4.45. The streamlines move smoothly over the airfoil—there is no ﬂow separation of any consequence. A computational ﬂuid dynamicsolution of the variation of pressure coefﬁcient over the upper surface of theairfoil is shown at the bottom of Figure 4.45. Starting at the stagnation pointat the leading edge, where for incompressible ﬂow C p=1.0, the ﬂow rapidly expands around the top surface. The pressure decreases dramatically, dipping to aminimum pressure at a location about 10 percent of the chord length downstreamof the leading edge. Then as the ﬂow moves farther downstream, the pressure390 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 0.20 /H110021.01.0 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 x/cp – p/H11009 /H9267/H11009V/H110092 1 2 Here, dp/dx is (+); this is an adverse pressure gradient,but it is moderateNASA LS(1)–0417 airfoil Angle of attack = 0/H11034x p/H11009V/H11009Attached flow Figure 4.45 Pressure distribution over the top surface for attached ﬂow over an airfoil.

This region of increasing pressure is called a region of adverse pressure gradient. By deﬁnition, an adverse pressure gradient is a region wherethe pressure increases in the ﬂow direction, that is, in Figure 4.45, the region where dp/dxispositive. For the conditions shown in Figure 4.45, the adverse pressure gradient is moderate; that is, dp/dxis small, and for all practical purposes the ﬂow remains attached to the airfoil surface except for a small region near thetrailing edge (not shown in Figure 4.45). Now consider the same airfoil at the very high angle of attack of 18.4 degrees, as shown in Figure 4.46. First, assume we have a purely inviscid ﬂow with noﬂow separation—a purely artiﬁcial situation. A numerical solution for the inviscidﬂow gives the results shown by the dashed curve in Figure 4.46. In this artiﬁcialsituation, the pressure would drop precipitously downstream of the leading edgeto a value of C palmost −9, and then rapidly increase downstream, recovering0.20 /H110021 /H110022 /H110023 /H110024 /H110025 /H110026 /H110027 /H1100281 0.4 0.6 1.0 x/c p – p/H11009 /H9267/H11009V/H110092 1 2Pressure distribution with separation Pressure distribution if there were no separation; dp/dxis (+) and largeNASA LS(1)–0417 airfoil Angle of attack = 18.4/H11034Separated flowx Figure 4.46 Pressure distribution over the top surface for separated ﬂow over an airfoil.

Note that for separated ﬂow, the lift decreases and the drag increases. to a value slightly above p∞at the trailing edge. In this recovery, the pressure would increase rapidly, in contrast to the case shown in Figure 4.45. The adverse pressure gradient would be severe; that is, dp/dxwould be large. In such a case, therealviscous ﬂow tends to separate from the surface. In this real separated ﬂow, theactual surface pressure distribution is given in Figure 4.46 by the solid curve, obtained from a computational ﬂuid dynamic viscous ﬂow calculation using thecomplete Navier-Stokes equations (see Chapter 15). In comparison to the dashedcurve, the actual pressure distribution does not dip to as low a pressure minimum,and the pressure near the trailing edge does not recover to a value above p ∞. It is important to visualize and compare the pressures acting on the surface of the airfoil for the case shown in Figure 4.46, this comparison is sketched inFigure 4.47. Here the airfoil at a large angle of attack (thus with ﬂow separation) isshown with the real surface pressure distribution symbolized by the solid arrows.Pressure always acts normal to the surface. Hence the arrows are all locallyperpendicular to the surface. The length of the arrows is representative of themagnitude of the pressure. A solid curve is drawn through the base of the arrows toform an “envelope” to make the pressure distribution easier to visualize. However,if the ﬂow were notseparated, that is, if the ﬂow were attached, then the pressure distribution would be that shown by the dashed arrows (and the dashed envelope).CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 393 The solid and dashed arrows in Figure 4.47 qualitatively correspond to the solid and dashed pressure distribution curves, respectively, in Figure 4.46. The solid and dashed arrows in Figure 4.47 should be compared carefully. They explain the two major consequences of separated ﬂow over the airfoil. Theﬁrst consequence is a loss of lift. The aerodynamic lift (the vertical force shownin Figure 4.47) is derived from the net component of the pressure distribution inthe vertical direction in Figure 4.47 (assuming that the freestream relative windis horizontal in this ﬁgure). High lift is obtained when the pressure on the bottomsurface is large and the pressure on the top surface is small. Separation does notaffect the bottom surface pressure distribution. However, comparing the solid anddashed arrows on the top surface just downstream of the leading edge, we ﬁnd the solid arrows indicating a higher pressure when the ﬂow is separated. This higherpressure is pushing down, hence reducing the lift. This reduction in lift is alsocompounded by the geometric effect that the position of the top surface of theairfoil near the leading edge is approximately horizontal in Figure 4.47. Whenthe ﬂow is separated, causing a higher pressure on this part of the airfoil surface,the direction in which the pressure is acting is closely aligned to the vertical,and hence, almost the full effect of the increased pressure is felt by the lift. Thecombined effect of the increased pressure on the top surface near the leading edge,and the fact that this portion of the surface is approximately horizontal, leads tothe rather dramatic loss of lift when the ﬂow separates. Note in Figure 4.47 thatthe lift for separated ﬂow (the solid vertical vector) is smaller than the lift thatwould exist if the ﬂow were attached (the dashed vertical vector). Now let us concentrate on that portion of the top surface near the trailing edge. On this portion of the airfoil surface, the pressure for the separated ﬂowis now smaller than the pressure that would exist if the ﬂow were attached. Moreover, the top surface near the trailing edge geometrically is inclined more tothe horizontal, and, in fact, somewhat faces in the horizontal direction. Recall thatthe drag is in the horizontal direction in Figure 4.47. Because of the inclinationof the top surface near the trailing edge, the pressure exerted on this portion ofthe surface has a strong component in the horizontal direction. This componentacts toward the left, tending to counter the horizontal component of force due tothe high pressure acting on the nose of the airfoil pushing toward the right. Thenet pressure drag on the airfoil is the difference between the force exerted on thefront pushing toward the right and the force exerted on the back pushing towardthe left. When the ﬂow is separated, the pressure on the back is lower than itwould be if the ﬂow were attached. Hence, for the separated ﬂow, there is less force on the back pushing toward the left, and the netdrag acting toward the right is therefore increased. Note in Figure 4.47 that the drag for separated ﬂow (the solid horizontal vector) is larger than the drag that would exist if the ﬂow wereattached (the dashed horizontal vector). Therefore, two major consequences of the ﬂow separating over an airfoil are: 1.A drastic loss of lift (stalling). 2.A major increase in drag, caused by pressure drag due to ﬂow separation.394 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Why does a ﬂow separate from a surface? The answer is addressed in detail in Section 15.2. In brief, in a region of adverse pressure gradient the ﬂuid elements moving along a streamline have to work their way “uphill” against an increasingpressure. Consequently, the ﬂuid elements will slow down under the inﬂuence ofan adverse pressure gradient. For the ﬂuid elements moving outside the boundarylayer, where the velocity (and hence kinetic energy) is high, this is not much of aproblem. The ﬂuid elements keep moving downstream. However, consider a ﬂuidelement deep inside the boundary layer. Its velocity is already small because itis retarded by friction forces. The ﬂuid element still encounters the same adversepressure gradient because the pressure is transmitted without change normal tothe wall, but its velocity is too low to negotiate the increasing pressure. As aresult, the element comes to a stop somewhere downstream and reverses its di-rection. Such reversed ﬂow causes the ﬂow ﬁeld in general to separate from thesurface, as shown at the top of Figure 4.46. This is physically how separated ﬂowdevelops. 4.12.5 Comment In this section we estimated skin friction drag on an airfoil by using the model ofa ﬂat plate at zero angle of attack, and calculating the skin friction drag for theairfoil using the formulas for the ﬂat plate such as Equation (4.86) for laminarﬂow and Equation (4.88) for turbulent ﬂow. 5How reasonable is this? How close does the ﬂat plate skin friction drag on a ﬂat plate come to that on an airfoil?How close does the local shear stress distribution over the surface of the ﬂat plateresemble that on the airfoil surface? Some answers can be obtained by comparing the relatively exact computa- tional ﬂuid dynamic calculations of Lombardi et al. (Reference 88) for the viscousﬂow over an NACA 0012 airfoil at zero angle of attack with that for a ﬂat plate.The variation of the local skin friction coefﬁcient, deﬁned as c f=τw/q∞,a sa function of distance from the leading edge is given in Figure 4.48 for both theairfoil and the ﬂat plate. They are remarkably close; clearly, for the purpose of thepresent section the modeling of the airfoil skin friction drag by use of ﬂat plateresults is reasonable. With this, we end our discussion of airfoil drag at low speeds. Although the main thrust of this chapter is the low-speed inviscid potential ﬂow over airfoilswith the consequent prediction of lift, the present section provides some balanceby exploring the effects of viscous ﬂow on airfoil behavior, and the consequentproduction of drag. More aspects of the real ﬂow over airfoils are given in Sec-tion 4.13. 5In 1921, Walter Diehl’s article in NACA TR111, entitled “The Variation of Aerofoil Lift and Drag Coefﬁcients with Changes in Size and Speed,” suggested that the airfoil drag coefﬁcient varies in the same manner as that for a ﬂat plate at zero angle of attack. He did not say that the airfoil drag coefﬁcientequals that for a ﬂat plate, but rather has the same Reynolds number variation. Diehl’s suggestion,however, appears to be the ﬁrst effort to use ﬂat plate data in some fashion to estimate airfoil drag.CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 395 0.008 0.0060.0040.002 00 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1c f x/cFluent RSM BlowsFlat plate Figure 4.48 Local skin-friction coefﬁcient distributions over an NACA 0012 airfoil, compared with that for a ﬂat plate. 4.13 APPLIED AERODYNAMICS: THE FLOW OVER AN AIRFOIL—THE REAL CASE In this chapter, we have studied the inviscid, incompressible ﬂow over airfoils. When compared with actual experimental lift and moment data for airfoils inlow-speed ﬂows, we have seen that our theoretical results based on the assump-tion of inviscid ﬂow are quite good—with one glaring exception. In the realcase, ﬂow separation occurs over the top surface of the airfoil when the angleof attack exceeds a certain value—the “stalling” angle of attack. As described inSections 4.3 and 4.12, this is a viscous effect. As shown in Figure 4.9, the liftcoefﬁcient reaches a local maximum denoted by c l,max, and the angle of attack at which cl,maxis achieved is the stalling angle of attack. An increase in αbeyond this value usually results in a (sometimes rather precipitous) drop in lift. At angles ofattack well below the stalling angle, the experimental data clearly show a linear increase in c lwith increasing α—a result that is predicted by the theory presented in this chapter. Indeed, in this linear region, the inviscid ﬂow theory is in excellentagreement with the experiment, as reﬂected in Figure 4.10 and as demonstratedby Example 4.6. However, the inviscid theory does not predict ﬂow separation,and consequently the prediction of c l,maxand the stalling angle of attack must be treated in some fashion by viscous ﬂow theory. Such viscous ﬂow analyses arethe purview of Part 4. On the other hand, the purpose of this section is to examinethephysical features of the real ﬂow over an airfoil, and ﬂow separation is an inherent part of this real ﬂow. Therefore, let us take a more detailed look at howthe ﬂow ﬁeld over an airfoil changes as the angle of attack is increased, and howthe lift coefﬁcient is affected by such changes. The ﬂow ﬁelds over an NACA 4412 airfoil at different angles of attack are shown in Figure 4.49. Here, the streamlines are drawn to scale as obtained from396 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 00.51.01.5 10(e)(c)(a)( b) (d)cl /H11005 1.6 cl,max cl,mincdcl clcl /H11005 1.2cl /H11005 0.35cl /H11005 0.6 (f)/H1100210 /H110020.5 /H110021.0/H9251/H9251 /H11005 15/H11034(/H11001)/H9251 /H11005 15/H11034(/H11002)/H9251 /H11005 5/H11034 /H9251 /H11005 2/H11034 /H9251/H9251 /H11005 10/H11034 Figure 4.49 Example of leading-edge stall.

The corresponding experimentally measured lift coefﬁcients are indicated by arrows at the right of each streamline picture, where the length of each arrow indicates the relative magnitude of the lift. The lift coefﬁcient is also shown in part ( f).CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 397 the experimental results of Hikaru Ito given in Reference 47. The experimental streamline patterns were made visible by a smoke wire technique, wherein metal-lic wires spread with oil over their surfaces were heated by an electric pulse and theresulting white smoke creates visible streaklines in the ﬂow ﬁeld. In Figure 4.49,the angle of attack is progressively increased as we scan from Figure 4.49a toe; to the right of each streamline picture is an arrow, the length of which is proportionalto the value of the lift coefﬁcient at the given angle of attack. The actual experi-mentally measured lift curve for the airfoil is given in Figure 4.49f. Note that atlow angle of attack, such as α=2 ◦in Figure 4.49a, the streamlines are relatively undisturbed from their freestream shapes and clis small. As αis increased to 5◦, as shown in Figure 4.49b, and then to 10◦, as shown in Figure 4.49c, the stream- lines exhibit a pronounced upward deﬂection in the region of the leading edge,and a subsequent downward deﬂection in the region of the trailing edge. Notethat the stagnation point progressively moves downstream of the leading edgeover the bottom surface of the airfoil as αis increased. Of course, c lincreases as αis increased, and, in this region, the increase is linear, as seen in Figure 4.49f. When αis increased to slightly less than 15◦, as shown in Figure 4.49d, the curvature of the streamlines is particularly apparent. In Figure 4.49d, the ﬂowﬁeld is still attached over the top surface of the airfoil. However, as αis further increased slightly above 15 ◦, massive ﬂow-ﬁeld separation occurs over the top surface, as shown in Figure 4.49e. By slightly increasing αfrom that shown in Figure 4.49d to that in Figure 4.49e, the ﬂow quite suddenly separates from the leading edge and the lift coefﬁcient experiences a precipitous decrease, as seen inFigure 4.49f. The type of stalling phenomenon shown in Figure 4.49 is called leading-edge stall; it is characteristic of relatively thin airfoils with thickness ratios between 10 and 16 percent of the chord length. As seen above, ﬂow separation takes placerather suddenly and abruptly over the entire top surface of the airfoil, with theorigin of this separation occurring at the leading edge. Note that the lift curveshown in Figure 4.49f is rather sharp-peaked in the vicinity of c l,maxwith a rapid decrease in clabove the stall. A second category of stall is the trailing-edge stall. This behavior is charac- teristic of thicker airfoils such as the NACA 4421 shown in Figure 4.50. Here,we see a progressive and gradual movement of separation from the trailing edgetoward the leading edge as αis increased. The lift curve for this case is shown in Figure 4.51. The solid curve in Figure 4.51 is a repeat of the results for the NACA4412 airfoil shown earlier in Figure 4.49f—an airfoil with a leading-edge stall.The dot-dashed curve is the lift curve for the NACA 4421 airfoil—an airfoil witha trailing-edge stall. In comparing these two curves, note that: 1.The trailing-edge stall yields a gradual bending-over of the lift curve at maximum lift, in contrast to the sharp, precipitous drop in c lfor the leading-edge stall. The stall is “soft” for the trailing-edge stall. 2.The value of cl,maxis not so large for the trailing-edge stall. 3.For both the NACA 4412 and 4421 airfoils, the shape of the mean camberline is the same.

Re =2.1×105and V∞=8 m/s in air. linear lift slope and the zero-lift angle of attack should be the same for both airfoils; this is conﬁrmed by the experimental data in Figure 4.51. The onlydifference between the two airfoils is that one is thicker than the other.Hence, comparing results shown in Figures 4.49 to 4.51, we conclude thatthe major effect of thickness of the airfoil is its effect on the value of c l,max, and this effect is mirrored by the leading-edge stall behavior of the thinnerairfoil versus the trailing-edge stall behavior of the thicker airfoil. There is a third type of stall behavior, namely, behavior associated with the extreme thinness of an airfoil. This is sometimes labeled as “thin airfoil stall.” An extreme example of a very thin airfoil is a ﬂat plate; the lift curve for a ﬂatplate is shown as the dashed curve in Figure 4.51 labeled “thin airfoil stall.” Thestreamline patterns for the ﬂow over a ﬂat plate at various angles of attack aregiven in Figure 4.52. The thickness of the ﬂat plate is 2 percent of the chord length.Inviscid, incompressible ﬂow theory shows that the velocity becomes inﬁnitelylarge at a sharp convex corner; the leading edge of a ﬂat plate at an angle ofattack is such a case. In the real ﬂow over the plate as shown in Figure 4.52,nature addresses this singular behavior by having the ﬂow separate at the leadingedge, even for very low values of α. Examining Figure 4.52a, where α=3 ◦, we observe a small region of separated ﬂow at the leading edge.

As αis increased, the reattachment point moves further downstream; that is, the separation bubble becomes larger. This is illustrated in Figure 4.52b where α=7◦. Atα=9◦(Figure 4.52c), the separation bubble extends over almost the complete ﬂat plate. Referring back to Figure 4.51,we note that this angle of attack corresponds to c l,maxfor the ﬂat plate. When αis increased further, total ﬂow separation is present, such as shown in Figure 4.52d.The lift curve for the ﬂat plate in Figure 4.51 shows an early departure from itslinear variation at about α=3 ◦; this corresponds to the formation of the leading- edge separation bubble. The lift curve gradually bends over as αis increased further and exhibits a very gradual and “soft” stall. This is a trend similar to thecase of the trailing-edge stall, although the physical aspects of the ﬂow are quitedifferent between the two cases. Of particular importance is the fact that c l,maxfor the ﬂat plate is considerably smaller than that for the two NACA airfoils comparedin Figure 4.51. Hence, we can conclude from Figure 4.51 that the value of c l,maxis critically dependent on airfoil thickness. In particular, by comparing the ﬂat platewith the two NACA airfoils, we see that some thickness is vital to obtaining a high value of c l,max. However, beyond that, the amount of thickness will inﬂuence the type of stall (leading-edge versus trailing-edge), and airfoils that are very thicktend to exhibit reduced values of c l,maxas the thickness increases. Hence, if we plot cl,maxversus thickness ratio, we expect to see a local maximum. Such is indeed the case, as shown in Figure 4.53. Here, experimental data for cl,maxfor the NACA 63-2XX series of airfoils is shown as a function of the thickness ratio. Note thatas the thickness ratio increases from a small value, c l,maxﬁrst increases, reaches Figure 4.53 Effect of airfoil thickness on maximum lift coefﬁcient for the NACA 63-2XX series of airfoils.

The experimental data in Figure 4.53 is plotted withthe Reynolds number as a parameter. Note that c l,maxfor a given airfoil is clearly a function of Re, with higher values of cl,maxcorresponding to higher Reynolds numbers. Since ﬂow separation is responsible for the lift coefﬁcient exhibitinga local maximum, since ﬂow separation is a viscous phenomenon, and since aviscous phenomenon is governed by a Reynolds number, it is no surprise thatc l,maxexhibits some sensitivity to Re. When was the signiﬁcance of airfoil thickness ﬁrst understood and appre- ciated? This question is addressed in the historical note in Section 4.14, wherewe will see that the aerodynamic properties of thick airfoils even transcendedtechnology during World War I and impacted the politics of the armistice. Let us examine some other aspects of airfoil aerodynamics—aspects that are not always appreciated in a ﬁrst study of the subject. The simple generation oflift by an airfoil is not the prime consideration in its design—even a barn doorat an angle of attack produces lift. Rather, there are two ﬁgures of merit that areprimarily used to judge the quality of a given airfoil: 1.The lift-to-drag ratio L /D. An efﬁcient airfoil produces lift with a minimum of drag; that is, the ratio of lift-to-drag is a measure of the aerodynamic efﬁciency of an airfoil. The standard airfoils discussed in thischapter have high L/Dratios—much higher than that of a barn door. The L/Dratio for a complete ﬂight vehicle has an important impact on its ﬂight performance; for example, the range of the vehicle is directly proportionalto the L/Dratio. (See Reference 2 for an extensive discussion of the role of L/Don ﬂight performance of an airplane.) 2.The maximum lift coefﬁcient c l,max. An effective airfoil produces a high value of cl,max—much higher than that produced by a barn door. The maximum lift coefﬁcient is worth some additional discussion here. For a complete ﬂight vehicle, the maximum lift coefﬁcient CL,maxdetermines the stalling speed of the aircraft as discussed in the Design Box at the end of Sec-tion 1.8. From Equation (1.47), repeated below: V stall=/radicalBigg 2W ρ∞SC L,max(1.47) Therefore, a tremendous incentive exists to increase the maximum lift coefﬁcientof an airfoil, in order to obtain either lower stalling speeds or higher payloadweights at the same speed, as reﬂected in Equation (1.47). Moreover, the ma-neuverability of an airplane (i.e., the smallest possible turn radius and the fastestpossible turn rate) depends on a large value of C L,max(see Section 6.17 of Refer- ence 2). On the other hand, for an airfoil at a given Reynolds number, the value ofc l,maxis a function primarily of its shape. Once the shape is speciﬁed, the value ofcl,maxis what nature dictates, as we have already seen. Therefore, to increase cl,maxbeyond such a value, we must carry out some special measures. Such special measures include the use of ﬂaps and/or leading-edge slats to increase402 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow (b) (c) (a)cl /H9004cl/H9251 /H11005 0/H11034/H9254 /H11005 0/H11034/H11001/H9254 /H9254 /H11005 10 /H9251 /H11005 0/H11034/H9254 /H11005 15/H11034 /H9251/H11034/H1100210/H11002100 10 0 /H110020.50.5 /H110021.01.01.5 20 Figure 4.54 Effect of ﬂap deﬂection on streamline shapes.

These are called high-lift devices, and are discussed in more detail below. A trailing-edge ﬂap is simply a portion of the trailing-edge section of the airfoil that is hinged and which can be deﬂected upward or downward, as sketched in the insert in Figure 4.54a. When the ﬂap is deﬂected downward (a positive angleδin Figure 4.54a), the lift coefﬁcient is increased, as shown in Figure 4.54a. This increase is due to an effective increase in the camber of the airfoil as the ﬂapis deﬂected downward. The thin airfoil theory presented in this chapter clearlyshows that the zero-lift angle of attack is a function of the amount of camber [seeEquation (4.61)], with α L=0becoming more negative as the camber is increased. In terms of the lift curve shown in Figure 4.54a, the original curve for no ﬂapdeﬂection goes through the origin because the airfoil is symmetric; however, asthe ﬂap is deﬂected downward, this lift curve simply translates to the left becauseα L=0is becoming more negative. In Figure 4.54a, the results are given for ﬂap deﬂections of ±10◦. Comparing the case for δ=10◦with the no-deﬂectionCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 403 Figure 4.55 Effect of leading-edge ﬂap on lift coefﬁcient. case, we see that, at a given angle of attack, the lift coefﬁcient is increased by an amount /Delta1cldue to ﬂap deﬂection. Moreover, the actual value of cl,maxis increased by ﬂap deﬂection, although the angle of attack at which cl,maxoccurs is slightly decreased. The change in the streamline pattern when the ﬂap is deﬂected isshown in Figure 4.54b andc. Figure 4.54b is the case for α=0 andδ=0 (i.e., a symmetric ﬂow). However, when αis held ﬁxed at zero, but the ﬂap is deﬂected by 15 ◦, as shown in Figure 4.54c, the ﬂow ﬁeld becomes unsymmetrical and resembles the lifting ﬂows shown (e.g., in Figure 4.49). That is, the streamlinesin Figure 4.54c are deﬂected upward in the vicinity of the leading edge and downward near the trailing edge, and the stagnation point moves to the lowersurface of the airfoil—just by deﬂecting the ﬂap downward. High-lift devices can also be applied to the leading edge of the airfoil, as shown in the inset in Figure 4.55. These can take the form of a leading-edge slat,leading-edge droop, or a leading-edge ﬂap. Let us concentrate on the leading-edge slat, which is simply a thin, curved surface that is deployed in front of theleading edge. In addition to the primary airﬂow over the airfoil, there is now asecondary ﬂow that takes place through the gap between the slat and the airfoilleading edge. This secondary ﬂow from the bottom to the top surface modiﬁes404 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow (a)( b) (c)( d)/H9251 /H11005 10/H11034/H9251 /H11005 25/H11034 /H9251 /H11005 30/H11034(/H11002) /H9251 /H11005 30/H11034(/H11001) Figure 4.56 Effect of a leading-edge slat on the streamline pattern over an NACA 4412 airfoil. (The streamlines are drawn to scale from the experimental data in Nakayama, Y . (ed): Visualized Flow, compiled by the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers, Pergamon Press, New York, 1988.) the pressure distribution over the top surface; the adverse pressure gradient which would normally exist over much of the top surface is mitigated somewhat bythis secondary ﬂow, hence delaying ﬂow separation over the top surface. Thus, aleading-edge slat increases the stalling angle of attack, and hence yields a higherc l,max, as shown by the two lift curves in Figure 4.55, one for the case without a leading-edge device and the other for the slat deployed. Note that the function ofa leading-edge slat is inherently different from that of a trailing-edge ﬂap. Thereis no change in α L=0; rather, the lift curve is simply extended to a higher stalling angle of attack, with the attendant increase in cl,max. The streamlines of a ﬂow ﬁeld associated with an extended leading-edge slat are shown in Figure 4.56. Theairfoil is in an NACA 4412 section. (Note: The ﬂows shown in Figure 4.56 do not correspond exactly with the lift curves shown in Figure 4.55, although thegeneral behavior is the same.) The stalling angle of attack for the NACA 4412airfoil without slat extension is about 15 ◦, but increases to about 30◦when the slat is extended. In Figure 4.56a, the angle of attack is 10◦. Note the ﬂow through the gap between the slat and the leading edge. In Figure 4.56 b, the angle of attack is 25◦and the ﬂow is still attached. This prevails to an angle of attack slightly less than 30◦, as shown in Figure 4.56c. At slightly higher than 30◦ﬂow separation suddenly occurs and the airfoil stalls. The high-lift devices used on modern, high-performance aircraft are usually a combination of leading-edge slats (or ﬂaps) and multielement trailing-edge ﬂaps.Typical airfoil conﬁgurations with these devices are sketched in Figure 4.57.

The trailing-edge device is a multielement ﬂap. conﬁgurations including the high-lift devices are shown: A—the cruise conﬁgu- ration, with no deployment of the high-lift devices; B—a typical conﬁguration at takeoff, with both the leading- and trailing-edge devices partially deployed; andC—a typical conﬁguration at landing, with all devices fully extended. Note that for conﬁguration C, there is a gap between the slat and the leading edge and several gaps between the different elements of the multielement trailing-edgeﬂap. The streamline pattern for the ﬂow over such a conﬁguration is shown inFigure 4.58. Here, the leading-edge slat and the multielement trailing-edge ﬂapare fully extended. The angle of attack is 25 ◦. Although the main ﬂow over the top surface of the airfoil is essentially separated, the local ﬂow through the gapsin the multielement ﬂap is locally attached to the top surface of the ﬂap; becauseof this locally attached ﬂow, the lift coefﬁcient is still quite high, on the orderof 4.5. With this, we end our discussion of the real ﬂow over airfoils. In retrospect, we can say that the real ﬂow at high angles of attack is dominated by ﬂowseparation—a phenomenon that is not properly modeled by the inviscid theoriespresented in this chapter. On the other hand, at lower angles of attack, such asthose associated with the cruise conditions of an airplane, the inviscid theoriespresented here do an excellent job of predicting both lift and moments on anairfoil. Moreover, in this section, we have clearly seen the importance of airfoilthickness in determining the angle of attack at which ﬂow separation will occur, and hence greatly affecting the maximum lift coefﬁcient.406 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow /H9251 /H11005 25/H11034 Figure 4.58 Effect of leading-edge and multielement ﬂaps on the streamline pattern around an airfoil at angle of attack of 25◦.

(Forthe pivotal role played by George Cayley in the development of the airplane, seethe extensive historical discussion in Chapter 1 of Reference 2.) Note that rightfrom the beginning of the modern conﬁguration aircraft, the wing sections werevery thin—whatever thickness was present, it was strictly for structural stiffnessof the wing. Extremely thin airfoil sections were perpetuated by the work ofHoratio Phillips in England. Phillips carried out the ﬁrst serious wind-tunnelexperiments in which the aerodynamic characteristics of a number of differentairfoil shapes were measured. (See Section 5.20 of Reference 2 for a presentationof the historical development of airfoils.) Some of Phillips airfoil sections areshown in Figure 4.60—note that they are the epitome of exceptionally thin airfoils.The early pioneers of aviation such as Otto Lilienthal in Germany and SamuelPierpont Langley in America (see Chapter 1 of Reference 2) continued this thinairfoil tradition. This was especially true of the Wright brothers, who in the periodof 1901–1902 tested hundreds of different wing sections and planform shapes intheir wind tunnel in Dayton, Ohio (recall our discussion in Section 1.1 and theCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 407 Figure 4.59 The ﬁrst modern conﬁguration airplane in history: George Cayley’s model glider of 1804.

The six upper shapes were patented by Phillips in 1884; the lower airfoil was patented in 1891. Note the thinproﬁle shapes. models shown in Figure 1.7). A sketch of some of the Wrights’ airfoil sections is given in Figure 4.61—for the most part, very thin sections. Indeed, such a thinairfoil section was used on the 1903 Wright Flyer, as can be readily seen in theside view of the Flyer shown in Figure 4.62. The important point here is that allof the early pioneering aircraft, and especially the Wright Flyer, incorporated verythin airfoil sections—airfoil sections that performed essentially like the ﬂat plateresults discussed in Section 4.13, and as shown in Figure 4.51 (the dashed curve)and by the streamline pictures in Figure 4.52. Conclusion: These early airfoilsections suffered ﬂow-ﬁeld separation at small angles of attack and, consequently,had low values of c l,max. By the standards we apply today, these were simply very poor airfoil sections for the production of high lift. This situation carried into the early part of World War I. In Figure 4.63, we see four airfoil sections that were employed on World War I aircraft. The topthree sections had thickness ratios of about 4 to 5 percent and are representativeof the type of sections used on all aircraft until 1917. For example, the SPAD XIII(shown in Figure 3.50), the fastest of all World War I ﬁghters, had a thin airfoilsection like the Eiffel section shown in Figure 4.63. Why were such thin airfoil408 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 4.61 Some typical airfoil shapes tested by the Wright brothers in their wind tunnelduring 1902–1903.

(Courtesy of the National Air and Space Museum). sections considered to be the best by most designers of World War I aircraft? The historical tradition described above might be part of the answer—a tradition thatstarted with Cayley. Also, there was quite clearly a mistaken notion at that timethatthick airfoils would produce high drag. Of course, today we know the oppositeCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 409 Figure 4.63 Some examples of different airfoil shapes used on World War I aircraft. (Source: Loftin, Lawrence K., Jr.: Quest for Performance: The Evolution of Modern Aircraft, NASA SP-468, 1985). to be true; review our discussion of streamlined shapes in Section 1.12 for this fact. Laurence Loftin in Reference 45 surmises that the mistaken notion mighthave been fostered by early wind-tunnel tests. By the nature of the early windtunnels in use—small sizes and very low speeds—the data were obtained at verylow Reynolds numbers, less than 100,000 based on the airfoil-chord length. TheseReynolds numbers are to be compared with typical values in the millions for actualairplane ﬂight. Modern studies of low Reynolds number ﬂows over conventionalthick airfoils (e.g., see Reference 48) clearly show high-drag coefﬁcients, incontrast to the lower values that occur for the high Reynolds number associatedwith the ﬂight of full-scale aircraft. Also, the reason for the World War I airplanedesigner’s preference for thin airfoils might be as simple as the tendency to followthe example of the wings of birds, which are quite thin. In any event, the design ofall English, French, and American World War I aircraft incorporated thin airfoilsand, consequently, suffered from poor high-lift performance. The fundamentalsof airfoil aerodynamics as we know them today (and as being presented in thisbook) were simply not sufﬁciently understood by the designers during WorldWar I. In turn, they never appreciated what they were losing. This situation changed dramatically in 1917. Work carried out in Germany at the famous G¨ ottingen aerodynamic laboratory of Ludwig Prandtl (see Section 5.8for a biographical sketch of Prandtl) demonstrated the superiority of a thick airfoilsection, such as the G¨ ottingen 298 section shown at the bottom of Figure 4.63. Thisrevolutionary development was immediately picked up by the famous designerAnthony Fokker, who incorporated the 13-percent-thick G¨ ottingen 298 proﬁle in410 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 4.64 The World War I Fokker Dr-1 triplane, the ﬁrst ﬁghter aircraft to use a thick airfoil. (© Ed Maker/The Denver Post via Getty Images). his new Fokker Dr-1—the famous triplane ﬂown by the “Red Baron,” Rittmeister Manfred Freiher von Richthofen. A photograph of the Fokker Dr-1 is shown inFigure 4.64. The major beneﬁts derived from Fokker’s use of the thick airfoilwere: 1.The wing structure could be completely internal; that is the wings of the Dr-1 were a cantilever design, which removed the need for the conventionalwire bracing that was used in other aircraft. This, in turn, eliminated thehigh drag associated with these interwing wires, as discussed at the end ofSection 1.11. For this reason, the Dr-1 had a zero-lift drag coefﬁcient of0.032, among the lowest of World War I airplanes. (By comparison thezero-lift drag coefﬁcient of the French SPAD XIII was 0.037.) 2.The thick airfoil provided the Fokker Dr-1 with a high maximum liftcoefﬁcient. Its performance was analogous to the upper curves shown in Figure 4.51. This, in turn, provided the Dr-1 with an exceptionally highrate-of-climb as well as enhanced maneuverability—characteristics thatwere dominant in dog-ﬁghting combat. Anthony Fokker continued the use of a thick airfoil in his design of the D-VII, as shown in Figure 4.65. This gave the D-VII a much greater rate-of-climb than its two principal opponents at the end of the war—the English Sopwith Camel andthe French SPAD XIII, both of which still used very thin airfoil sections. This rate-of-climb performance, as well as its excellent handling characteristics, singledout the Fokker D-VII as the most effective of all German World War I ﬁghters.The respect given by the Allies to this machine is no more clearly indicated thanCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 411 Figure 4.65 The World War I Fokker D-VII, one of the most effective ﬁghters of the war, due in part to its superior aerodynamic performance allowed by a thick airfoil section.

In this article, the Fokker D-VII isspeciﬁcally listed—the only airplane of any type to be explicitly mentioned in the armistice. To this author’s knowledge, this is the one and only time where abreakthrough in airfoil technology is essentially reﬂected in any major politicaldocument, though somewhat implicitly. 4.15 HISTORICAL NOTE: KUTTA, JOUKOWSKI, AND THE CIRCULATION THEORY OF LIFT Frederick W. Lanchester (1868–1946), an English engineer, automobile man-ufacturer, and self-styled aerodynamicist, was the ﬁrst to connect the idea ofcirculation with lift. His thoughts were originally set forth in a presentation givenbefore the Birmingham Natural History and Philosophical Society in 1894 andlater contained in a paper submitted to the Physical Society, which turned it down.Finally, in 1907 and 1908, he published two books, entitled Aerodynamics and Aerodonetics, where his thoughts on circulation and lift were described in de-tail. His books were later translated into German in 1909 and French in 1914.Unfortunately, Lanchester’s style of writing was difﬁcult to read and understand;this is partly responsible for the general lack of interest shown by British scien-tists in Lanchester’s work. Consequently, little positive beneﬁt was derived from412 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Lanchester’s writings. (See Section 5.7 for a more detailed portrait of Lanchester and his work.) Quite independently, and with total lack of knowledge of Lanchester’s think- ing, M. Wilhelm Kutta (1867–1944) developed the idea that lift and circulationare related. Kutta was born in Pitschen, Germany, in 1867 and obtained a Ph.D. inmathematics from the University of Munich in 1902. After serving as professorof mathematics at several German technical schools and universities, he ﬁnallysettled at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart in 1911 until his retirementin 1935. Kutta’s interest in aerodynamics was initiated by the successful gliderﬂights of Otto Lilienthal in Berlin during the period 1890–1896 (see Chapter 1 ofReference 2). Kutta attempted theoretically to calculate the lift on the curved wingsurfaces used by Lilienthal. In the process, he surmised from experimental datathat the ﬂow left the trailing edge of a sharp-edged body smoothly and that thiscondition ﬁxed the circulation around the body (the Kutta condition, describedin Section 4.5). At the same time, he was convinced that circulation and lift wereconnected. Kutta was reluctant to publish these ideas, but after the strong insis-tence of his teacher, S. Finsterwalder, he wrote a paper entitled “Auftriebskraftein Stromenden Flussigkecten” (Lift in Flowing Fluids). This was actually a shortnote abstracted from his longer graduation paper in 1902, but it represents the ﬁrsttime in history where the concepts of the Kutta condition as well as the connectionof circulation with lift were ofﬁcially published. Finsterwalder clearly repeatedthe ideas of his student in a lecture given on September 6, 1909, in which hestated: On the upper surface the circulatory motion increases the translatory one, therefore there is high velocity and consequently low pressure, while on the lower surface thetwo movements are opposite, therefore there is low velocity with high pressure, withthe result of a thrust upward. However, in his 1902 note, Kutta did not give the precise quantitative relation between circulation and lift. This was left to Nikolai E. Joukowski (Zhukouski). Joukowski was born in Orekhovo in central Russia on January 5, 1847. Theson of an engineer, he became an excellent student of mathematics and physics,graduating with a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from Moscow University in1882. He subsequently held a joint appointment as a professor of mechanicsat Moscow University and the Moscow Higher Technical School. It was at thislatter institution that Joukowski built in 1902 the ﬁrst wind tunnel in Russia.Joukowski was deeply interested in aeronautics, and he combined a rare gift forboth experimental and theoretical work in the ﬁeld. He expanded his wind tunnelinto a major aerodynamics laboratory in Moscow. Indeed, during World War I,his laboratory was used as a school to train military pilots in the principles ofaerodynamics and ﬂight. When he died in 1921, Joukowski was by far the mostnoted aerodynamicist in Russia. Much of Joukowski’s fame was derived from a paper published in 1906, wherein he gives, for the ﬁrst time in history, the relation L /prime=ρ∞V∞/Gamma1—the Kutta-Joukowski theorem. In Joukowski’s own words:CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 413 If an irrotational two-dimensional ﬂuid current, having at inﬁnity the velocity V∞ surrounds any closed contour on which the circulation of velocity is /Gamma1, the force of the aerodynamic pressure acts on this contour in a direction perpendicular to the velocity and has the value L/prime=ρ∞V∞/Gamma1 The direction of this force is found by causing to rotate through a right angle thevector V ∞around its origin in an inverse direction to that of the circulation. Joukowski was unaware of Kutta’s 1902 note and developed his ideas on circulation and lift independently. However, in recognition of Kutta’s contribution, the equation given above has propagated through the twentieth century as the“Kutta-Joukowski theorem.” Hence, by 1906—just 3 years after the ﬁrst successful ﬂight of the Wright brothers—the circulation theory of lift was in place, ready to aid aerodynamicsin the design and understanding of lifting surfaces. In particular, this principleformed the cornerstone of the thin airfoil theory described in Sections 4.7 and4.8. Thin airfoil theory was developed by Max Munk, a colleague of Prandtlin Germany, during the ﬁrst few years after World War I. However, the veryexistence of thin airfoil theory, as well as its amazingly good results, rests uponthe foundation laid by Lanchester, Kutta, and Joukowski a decade earlier. 4.16 SUMMARY Return to the road map given in Figure 4.7.

If thetrailing-edge angle is ﬁnite, then the trailing edge is a stagnation point. If thetrailing edge is cusped, then the velocities leaving the top and bottom surfacesat the trailing edge are ﬁnite and equal in magnitude and direction. In eithercase, γ(TE)=0 (4.10) Thin airfoil theory is predicated on the replacement of the airfoil by the meancamber line. A vortex sheet is placed along the chord line, and its strengthadjusted such that, in conjunction with the uniform freestream, the camberline becomes a streamline of the ﬂow while at the same time satisfying theKutta condition.

When models of ﬂight vehicles are tested in wind tunnels, we want the aerodynamic measurements takenwith the models (lift and drag coefﬁcients, pressure coefﬁcients, etc.) to simulatethose quantities that prevail on the actual ﬂight vehicle in free ﬂight through the at-mosphere. There are, however, many reasons why the wind tunnel measurementsmay not be quite the same results as in free ﬂight (scale effects, instrumentationerrors, etc.), but one fundamental source of error is that the ﬂowﬁeld over a modelin a wind tunnel is bounded and constrained by the walls of the tunnel, whereasno such constraints exist in free ﬂight through the atmosphere (except when thevehicle is ﬂying in close proximity to the ground, with consequent “ground ef-fects” on the aerodynamics of the vehicle). In this section we will address thetunnel wall effects on a model in the tunnel and look at ways to compensate forthem on the data. The corrections to measurements made in wind tunnels due to wall effects have been a concern since the beginning of the serious use of wind tunnels.Indeed, three chapters in the deﬁnitive book on tunnel testing by Barlow, Rae,and Pope, Low-Speed Wind Tunnel Testing, 3rd Edition, Wiley, 1999, are devoted to wind tunnel wall corrections. It is beyond our scope here to exhaustivelylook at the subject. However, in Chapters 3 and 4 we have developed someelementary potential ﬂow methods to calculate ﬂows over bodies, and this leadsto the following challenge. Challenge: How can we use our potential ﬂow methods to examine to what extent wall effects might affect the ﬂow over a model mounted in a wind tunnel?416 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow /H92601 /H9271 /H11005 0 along wall IMAGEV/H11009r1 x1 x2a ay1 /H92602V/H11009r2y2 Figure 4.66 Image of a doublet. Solution: Let us take the classic case of the nonlifting ﬂow over a circular cylinder, as discussed in Section 3.13, where the streamlines are sketched in Figure 3.26. Using potential ﬂow theory, this ﬂow is synthesized by combining a doublet ﬂowwith a uniform freestream. The ﬂow ﬁeld extends to inﬁnity in all directions, andthe resulting streamline pattern has straight, uniform streamlines only at inﬁnity.In contrast, imagine a circular cylinder mounted in a wind tunnel ﬂow that isbounded above and below by straight, parallel walls. The ﬂow streamlines alongthe walls have to be straight and parallel. Simultaneously, another streamline mustbe a circle in order to simulate the surface streamline of the cylinder. How canwe simulate this condition? One answer is to use the method of images, the basic idea of which is as fol- lows. Return to Figure 3.26, which illustrates the combination of a doublet with auniform freestream. This same picture is sketched in the upper part of Figure 4.66.Here, the doublet is located at distance aabove the wall. The streamline along the wall must be straight and parallel to the wall; hence, the vertical componentof the ﬂow velocity must be zero at the wall, i.e., v=0. This cannot happen with just the doublet above the wall. However, if we imagine a second doubletof equal strength placed below the wall at an equal distance abelow the wall, then by symmetry the vertical components of the two ﬂows along the wall willcancel, yielding v=0 for the combined ﬂow along the wall. This second doublet is called an image of the ﬁrst; it is there simply to provide a straight, parallel streamline that represents the wall.CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 417 Let us examine the stream function for the combination of the doublet and its image. From Equation (3.91), for doublet 1, with strength κ1, /Psi11=−κ1 2πsinθ1 r1+V∞r1sinθ1 (C4.1) and for doublet 2 with strength κ2, /Psi12=−κ2 2πsinθ2 r2+V∞r2sinθ2 (C4.2) Using the cartesian coordinates x1,y1,x2, and y2shown in Figure 4.66, sinθ1=y1/radicalBig/parenleftbigx2 1+y2 1/parenrightbig sinθ2=y2/radicalBig/parenleftbigx2 2+y2 2/parenrightbig r1=/radicalBig x2 1+y2 1 r2=/radicalBig x2 2+y2 2 r1sinθ1=y1 r2sinθ2=y2 and therefore Equations (C4.1) and (C4.2) become, respectively, /Psi11=−κ1 2πy1/parenleftbigx2 1+y2 2/parenrightbig+V∞r1 (C4.3) /Psi12=−κ2 2πy2/parenleftbigx2 2+y2 2/parenrightbig+V∞r2 (C4.4) Consider point P in the ﬂow shown in Figure 4.66. This point represents any point in the ﬂow above the wall. The relation between the two sets of cartesiancoordinates ( x 1,y1) and ( x2,y2) is, from Figure 4.66: x2=x1 y2=2a+y1 Hence, the combined stream function at point P is ψ=/Psi11+/Psi12=−κ1 2πy1/parenleftbigx2 1+y2 1/parenrightbig+V∞y1−κ2 2π(2a+y1) x2 2+(2a+y1)2+V∞(2a+y1) (C4.5) Unfortunately, the streamline through the stagnation points in the ﬂow described by Equation (4.5) is not the shape of a circular cylinder; rather, it is the distortedshape sketched qualitatively in Figure 4.67. There would be a mirror image of thesame distorted shape below the wall. In order to more accurately represent the418 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 4.67 Body shape simulated by a doublet and its image in a uniform ﬂow (qualitative sketch). ﬂow over the circular cylinder, we need an image of the image to be placed above the cylinder, and then more images of the images arranged in a vertical array aboveand below. In this fashion, the ﬂow synthesized by all these images will approachcloser to the ﬂow over a circular cylinder, while at the same time preserving thestraight streamlines at the walls. This is the essence of the “method of images”used to represent the ﬂow over a body in the presence of a wall. Also, note thatwe have considered only the generation of a ﬂow with a straight streamline belowthe body; this would simulate the ﬂow over the body in the presence of a groundplane. In the wind tunnel case there is also an upper wall, and our “method ofimages” becomes more complex. Is there a better way of taking into account walleffects in the wind tunnel? Yes—one technique is to use computational ﬂuid dynamics to calculate the ﬂow in the test section with the test model mounted in it. The panel methodsdescribed in Sections 3.17 and 4.10 could be used by covering both the surfaceof the model and the surface of the tunnel walls with source and vortex panels.Results from such panel solutions for the ﬂow over a circular cylinder are sketchedin Figures 4.68 aand 4.68b . The streamlines over a nonlifting cylinder in free air are shown in Figure 4.68 a, and those for a nonlifting cylinder in a wind tunnel test section are shown in Figure 4.68b . The streamlines in the wind tunnel case are more constrained than in the free air case, and there would be an effect on thesurface pressure distribution on the circular cylinder. The computational resultsfrom a panel solution would identify such effects. The use of computationalﬂuid dynamics, such as panel methods, for wind tunnel wall corrections can beexpensive and time consuming, so the many empirical methods developed overthe years are still in vogue. See Barlow, Rae and Pope, Chapters 9 to 11 for anin-depth discussion. For our purposes here, the “solution” to this Integrated WorkChallenge has not been a solution per se, but rather a discussion of the problem.This is because the actual solution is long and detailed and beyond the scope ofthis book. Our purpose here is to simply open the thought process.CHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 419 Free air Wind tunnel (b)(a) Straight streamline Upper wall Straight streamline Lower wall Figure 4.68 Comparison between ( a) the streamlines over a cylinder in free air and (b) the streamlines over a cylinder in a wind tunnel. 4.18 PROBLEMS 4.1Consider the data for the NACA 2412 airfoil given in Figure 4.10. Calculate the lift and moment about the quarter chord (per unit span)for this airfoil when the angle of attack is 4 ◦and the freestream is at standard sea level conditions with a velocity of 50 ft/s.

If the lift per unit spanis 1353 N/m, what is the angle of attack? 4.3Starting with the deﬁnition of circulation, derive Kelvin’s circulationtheorem, Equation (4.11). 4.4Starting with Equation (4.35), derive Equation (4.36). 4.5Consider a thin, symmetric airfoil at 1.5 ◦angle of attack.

(Hint: A good source of experimental airfoil data is Reference 11.) 4.9Starting with Equations (4.35) and (4.43), derive Equation (4.62). 4.10 For the NACA 2412 airfoil, the lift coefﬁcient and moment coefﬁcientabout the quarter-chord at −6 ◦angle of attack are −0.39 and −0.045, respectively. At 4◦angle of attack, these coefﬁcients are 0.65 and −0.037, respectively. Calculate the location of the aerodynamic center. 4.11 Consider again the NACA 2412 airfoil discussed in Problem 4.10. Theairfoil is ﬂying at a velocity of 60 m/s at a standard altitude of 3 km (seeAppendix D). The chord length of the airfoil is 2 m. Calculate the lift perunit span when the angle of attack is 4 ◦. 4.12 For the airfoil in Problem 4.11, calculate the value of the circulationaround the airfoil. 4.13 In Section 3.15 we studied the case of the lifting ﬂow over a circularcylinder. In real life, a rotating cylinder in a ﬂow will produce lift; suchreal ﬂow ﬁelds are shown in the photographs in Figures 3.34(b ) and(c). Here, the viscous shear stress acting between the ﬂow and the surface ofthe cylinder drags the ﬂow around in the direction of rotation of thecylinder. For a cylinder of radius Rrotating with an angular velocity ωin an otherwise stationary ﬂuid, the viscous ﬂow solution for the velocityﬁeld obtained from the Navier-Stokes equations (Chapter 15) is V θ=R2ω r where Vθis the tangential velocity along the circular streamlines and ris the radial distance from the center of the cylinder. (See Schlichting,Boundary-Layer Theory, 6th ed., McGraw-Hill, 1968, page 81.) Note that V θvaries inversely with rand is of the same form as the inviscid ﬂow velocity for a point vortex given by Equation (3.105). If the rotatingcylinder has a radius of 1 m and is ﬂying at the same velocity and altitudeas the airfoil in Problem 4.11, what must its angular velocity be to produceCHAPTER 4Incompressible Flow over Airfoils 421 the same lift as the airfoil in Problem 4.11? (Note: You can check your results with the experimental data for lift on rotating cylinders in Hoerner, Fluid-Dynamic Lift, published by the author, 1975, pp. 21–4, Fig. 5.) 4.14 The question is often asked: Can an airfoil ﬂy upside-down? To answerthis, make the following calculation. Consider a positively camberedairfoil with a zero-lift angle of −3 ◦. The lift slope is 0.1 per degree. (a) Calculate the lift coefﬁcient at an angle of attack of 5◦.(b) Now imagine the same airfoil turned upside-down, but at the same 5◦angle of attack as part ( a). Calculate its lift coefﬁcient. (c ) At what angle of attack must the upside-down airfoil be set to generate the same lift as that when itis right-side-up at a 5 ◦angle of attack? 4.15 The airfoil section of the wing of the British Spitﬁre of World War II fame(see Figure 5.19) is an NACA 2213 at the wing root, tapering to an NACA2205 at the wing tip. The root chord is 8.33 ft. The measured proﬁle dragcoefﬁcient of the NACA 2213 airfoil is 0.006 at a Reynolds number of9×10 Consider the Spitﬁre cruising at an altitude of 18,000 ft. (a) At what velocity is it ﬂying for the root chord Reynolds number to be9×10 6? (b) At this velocity and altitude, assuming completely turbulent ﬂow, estimate the skin-friction drag coefﬁcient for the NACA 2213 airfoil,and compare this with the total proﬁle drag coefﬁcient. Calculate thepercentage of the proﬁle drag coefﬁcient that is due to pressure drag. Note: Assume that μvaries as the square root of temperature, as ﬁrst discussed in Section 1.8. 4.16 For the conditions given in Problem 4.15, a more reasonable calculation ofthe skin friction coefﬁcient would be to assume an initially laminarboundary layer starting at the leading edge, and then transitioning to aturbulent boundary layer at some point downstream. Calculate theskin-friction coefﬁcient for the Spitﬁre’s airfoil described in Problem 4.15,but this time assuming a critical Reynolds number of 10 6for transition.CHAPTER 5 Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings The one who has most carefully watched the soaring birds of prey sees man with wings and the faculty of using them. James Means, Editor ofthe Aeronautical Annual, 1895 PREVIEW BOX The Beechcraft Baron 58 twin-engine business air- craft is shown in three-view in Figure 5.1. The wingon this airplane has a 15 percent thick NACA 23015airfoil at the root, tapering to a 10 percent thick-ness at the tip. We studied airfoil properties in Chap-ter 4, ostensibly to be able to predict the lift anddrag characteristics of an airplane wing utilizing agiven airfoil shape. Wind tunnel data for the NACA23015 airfoil is given in Figure 5.2 in the standardformat used by the NACA as described in Refer-ence 11. The airfoil lift coefﬁcient and the momentcoefﬁcient about the quarter-chord point are given asa function of airfoil section angle of attack in Fig-ure 5.2a. The drag coefﬁcient and the moment coef-ﬁcient about the aerodynamic center are given as afunction of the lift coefﬁcient in Figure 5.2b. The air-foil shape is shown to scale at the top of Figure 5.2b . Results for three different values of the Reynoldsnumber based on chord length are shown, as indi-cated by the code near the bottom of Figure 5.2b . The data labeled “standard roughness” applies to a spe-cial case where the model surface was covered witha sandpaper-like grit; we are not concerned with thisspecial case. 423424 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 5.1 Beechcraft Baron 58, four- to six-seat general aviation airplane. Consider the Beechcraft Baron 58 cruising such that the wing is at a four-degree angle of attack. What are the lift and drag coefﬁcients of the wing?From Figure 5.2 a, for the airfoil at α=4 ◦, we have cl=0.54. Using the drag coefﬁcient data at the highest Reynolds number shown in Figure 5.2b , forcl=0.54 the corresponding drag coefﬁcient cd=0.0068. Using capital letters for the aerody- namic coefﬁcients of a wing, in contrast to the lowercase letters for an airfoil, we pose the question: Are C L andCDfor the wing the same as those for the airfoil? That is, CL=0.54 (?) CD=0.0068 (?) The answer is a resounding NO! Not even close!Surprised? How can this be? Why are the aero-dynamic coefﬁcients of the wing notthe same asthose for the airfoil shape from which the wing ismade? Surely, the aerodynamic properties of the air-foil must have something to do with the aerody-namic properties of the ﬁnite wing. Or else our stud-ies of airfoils in Chapter 4 would be a big waste oftime. The single, most important purpose of this chap- ter is to solve this mystery. This chapter is focusedon the aerodynamic properties of real, ﬁnite wings.The solution involves some interesting and (yes)some rather intense mathematics combined with someknowledge of the physical properties of the ﬂow overa ﬁnite wing. This is very important stuff. This chaptergets at the very core of the aerodynamics of a real air-plane ﬂying at speeds appropriate to the assumptionof incompressible ﬂow. Read on with vigor, and let ussolve this mystery.CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 425 –32–2.0–1.6–1.2–.8–.40.4 –.5–.4–.3–.2–.10.1.81.21.62.02.42.83.6 3.2 –24 –16 –8 0 8 16 24 32 Section angle of attack, /H92510, deg.Section lift coefficient, clMoment coefficient, cmc/4 NACA 23015 Wing Section Figure 5.2 aLift coefﬁcient and moment coefﬁcient about the quarter-chord for the NACA 23015 airfoil.426 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow –1.2 –.8 –.4.004 –.5–.4–.3–.2–.10.008.012.016.020.024/H11002.20 .2 .4 .6x/cy/c .8 1.0.028.036 .032.2 0 0 .4 .8 1.6 1.2 Section lift coefficient, clSection drag coefficient, cd Moment coefficient, cma.c NACA 23015 Wing SectionR 2.6 /H11003 105 6.0 8.96.0a.c. position x/c .231.239.243y/c .050.043.021 Standard roughness Figure 5.2 b(Continued) Drag coefﬁcient and moment coefﬁcient about the aerodynamic center for the NACA 23015 airfoil.CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 427 5.1 INTRODUCTION: DOWNWASH AND INDUCED DRAG In Chapter 4 we discussed the properties of airfoils, which are the same as the properties of a wing of inﬁnite span; indeed, airfoil data are frequently denoted as“inﬁnite wing” data. However, all real airplanes have wings of ﬁnite span, and thepurpose of the present chapter is to apply our knowledge of airfoil properties tothe analysis of such ﬁnite wings. This is the second step in Prandtl’s philosophyof wing theory, as described in Section 4.1. You should review Section 4.1 beforeproceeding further. Question: Why are the aerodynamic characteristics of a ﬁnite wing any differ- ent from the properties of its airfoil sections? Indeed, an airfoil is simply a sectionof a wing, and at ﬁrst thought, you might expect the wing to behave exactly thesame as the airfoil. However, as studied in Chapter 4, the ﬂow over an airfoilis two-dimensional. In contrast, a ﬁnite wing is a three-dimensional body, andconsequently the ﬂow over the ﬁnite wing is three-dimensional; that is, there is acomponent of ﬂow in the spanwise direction. To see this more clearly, examineFigure 5.3, which gives the top and front views of a ﬁnite wing. The physicalmechanism for generating lift on the wing is the existence of a high pressure onthe bottom surface and a low pressure on the top surface. The net imbalance ofthe pressure distribution creates the lift, as discussed in Section 1.5. However, as Figure 5.3 Finite wing. In this ﬁgure, the curvature of the streamlines over the top and bottom of the wing is exaggerated for clarity.428 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 5.4 Schematic of wing-tip vortices. a by-product of this pressure imbalance, the ﬂow near the wing tips tends to curl around the tips, being forced from the high-pressure region just underneath thetips to the low-pressure region on top. This ﬂow around the wing tips is shownin the front view of the wing in Figure 5.3. As a result, on the top surface of thewing, there is generally a spanwise component of ﬂow from the tip toward thewing root, causing the streamlines over the top surface to bend toward the root,as sketched on the top view shown in Figure 5.3. Similarly, on the bottom surfaceof the wing, there is generally a spanwise component of ﬂow from the root to-ward the tip, causing the streamlines over the bottom surface to bend toward thetip. Clearly, the ﬂow over the ﬁnite wing is three-dimensional, and therefore youwould expect the overall aerodynamic properties of such a wing to differ fromthose of its airfoil sections. The tendency for the ﬂow to “leak” around the wing tips has another important effect on the aerodynamics of the wing. This ﬂow establishes a circulatory motionthat trails downstream of the wing; that is, a trailing vortex is created at each wing tip. These wing-tip vortices are sketched in Figure 5.4 and are illustrated inFigure 5.5. The tip vortices are essentially weak “tornadoes” that trail downstreamof the ﬁnite wing. (For large airplanes such as a Boeing 747, these tip vorticescan be powerful enough to cause light airplanes following too closely to go out ofcontrol. Such accidents have occurred, and this is one reason for large spacingsbetween aircraft landing or taking off consecutively at airports.) These wing-tipvortices downstream of the wing induce a small downward component of airvelocity in the neighborhood of the wing itself. This can be seen by inspectingFigure 5.5; the two vortices tend to drag the surrounding air around with them, andthis secondary movement induces a small velocity component in the downwarddirection at the wing. This downward component is called downwash, denoted by the symbol w. In turn, the downwash combines with the freestream velocity V ∞to produce a local relative wind which is canted downward in the vicinity of each airfoil section of the wing, as sketched in Figure 5.6. Examine Figure 5.6 closely. The angle between the chord line and the direc- tion of V∞is the angle of attack α, as deﬁned in Section 1.5 and as used throughout our discussion of airfoil theory in Chapter 4. We now more precisely deﬁne αas thegeometric angle of attack. In Figure 5.6, the local relative wind is inclinedCHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 429 Figure 5.5 Wing-tip vortices from a ﬁnite wing.

The presence of downwash, and its effect on inclining the local relative wind in the downward direction, has two important effects on the local airfoil section, asfollows: 1.The angle of attack actually seen by the local airfoil section is the angle between the chord line and the local relative wind. This angle is given byα effin Figure 5.4 and is deﬁned as the effective angle of attack. Hence, although the wing is at a geometric angle of attack α, the local airfoil section is seeing a smaller angle, namely, the effective angle of attack αeff. From Figure 5.6, αeff=α−αi (5.1) 2.The local lift vector is aligned perpendicular to the local relative wind, andhence is inclined behind the vertical by the angle α i, as shown in Figure 5.6. Consequently, there is a component of the local lift vector in the direction of V∞; that is, there is a drag created by the presence of downwash. This drag is deﬁned as induced drag, denoted by Diin Figure 5.6. Hence, we see that the presence of downwash over a ﬁnite wing reduces the angle of attack that each section effectively sees, and moreover, it creates acomponent of drag—the induced drag D i. Keep in mind that we are still dealing with an inviscid, incompressible ﬂow, where there is no skin friction or ﬂowseparation. For such a ﬂow, there is a ﬁnite drag—the induced drag—on a ﬁnite wing. d’Alembert’s paradox does notoccur for a ﬁnite wing. The tilting backward of the lift vector shown in Figure 5.6 is one way of visualizing the physical generation of induced drag. Two alternate ways are asfollows: 1.The three-dimensional ﬂow induced by the wing-tip vortices shown in Figures 5.4 and 5.5 simply alters the pressure distribution on the ﬁnite wingin such a fashion that a net pressure imbalance exists in the direction of V ∞ (i.e., drag is created). In this sense, induced drag is a type of “pressure drag.” 2.The wing-tip vortices contain a large amount of translational and rotationalkinetic energy. This energy has to come from somewhere; indeed, it isultimately provided by the aircraft engine, which is the only source ofpower associated with the airplane. Since the energy of the vortices servesno useful purpose, this power is essentially lost. In effect, the extra powerprovided by the engine that goes into the vortices is the extra powerrequired from the engine to overcome the induced drag. Clearly, from the discussion in this section, the characteristics of a ﬁnite wing arenotidentical to the characteristics of its airfoil sections. Therefore, let us pro- ceed to develop a theory that will enable us to analyze the aerodynamic properties of ﬁnite wings. In the process, we follow the road map given in Figure 5.7—keepin touch with this road map as we progress through the present chapter.CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 431 Figure 5.7 Road map for Chapter 5. In this chapter, we note a difference in nomenclature. For the two-dimensional bodies considered in the previous chapters, the lift, drag, and moments per unit span have been denoted with primes, for example, L/prime,D/prime, and M/prime, and the cor- responding lift, drag, and moment coefﬁcients have been denoted by lowercaseletters, for example, c l,cd, and cm. In contrast, the lift, drag, and moments on a complete three-dimensional body such as a ﬁnite wing are given without primes,for example, L,D, and M, and the corresponding lift, drag, and moment coefﬁ- cients are given by capital letters, for example, C L,CD, and CM. This distinction has already been mentioned in Section 1.5. Finally, we note that the total drag on a subsonic ﬁnite wing in real life is the sum of the induced drag Di, the skin friction drag Df, and the pressure drag Dp due to ﬂow separation. The latter two contributions are due to viscous effects (seeSection 4.12 and Chapters 15 to 20). The sum of these two viscous-dominated dragcontributions is called proﬁle drag, as discussed in Section 4.3. The proﬁle dragcoefﬁcient c dfor an NACA 2412 airfoil was given in Figure 4.11. At moderate angle of attack, the proﬁle drag coefﬁcient for a ﬁnite wing is essentially the sameas for its airfoil sections. Hence, deﬁning the proﬁle drag coefﬁcient as c d=Df+Dp q∞S(5.2) and the induced drag coefﬁcient as CD,i=Di q∞S(5.3)432 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow the total drag coefﬁcient for the ﬁnite wing CDis given by CD=cd+CD,i (5.4) In Equation (5.4), the value of cdis usually obtained from airfoil data, such as given in Figures 4.11 and 5.2b . The value of CD,ican be obtained from ﬁnite- wing theory as presented in this chapter. Indeed, one of the central objectives of the present chapter is to obtain an expression for induced drag and to study itsvariation with certain design characteristics of the ﬁnite wing. (See Chapter 5 ofReference 2 for an additional discussion of the characteristics of ﬁnite wings.) 5.2 THE VORTEX FILAMENT, THE BIOT-SAVART LAW, AND HELMHOLTZ’S THEOREMS To establish a rational aerodynamic theory for a ﬁnite wing, we need to introducea few additional aerodynamic tools. To begin with, we expand the concept ofa vortex ﬁlament ﬁrst introduced in Section 4.4. In Section 4.4, we discussed astraight vortex ﬁlament extending to ±∞. (Review the ﬁrst paragraph of Sec- tion 4.4 before proceeding further.) In general, a vortex ﬁlament can be curved, as shown in Figure 5.8. Here, only a portion of the ﬁlament is illustrated. The ﬁlament induces a ﬂow ﬁeldin the surrounding space. If the circulation is taken about any path enclosingthe ﬁlament, a constant value /Gamma1is obtained. Hence, the strength of the vortex ﬁlament is deﬁned as /Gamma1. Consider a directed segment of the ﬁlament dl, as shown in Figure 5.8. The radius vector from dlto an arbitrary point Pin space is r. The segment dlinduces a velocity at Pequal to dV=/Gamma1 4πdl×r |r|3(5.5) Equation (5.5) is called the Biot-Savart law and is one of the most fundamental relations in the theory of inviscid, incompressible ﬂow. Its derivation is given inmore advanced books (see, e.g., Reference 9). Here, we must accept it without Figure 5.8 V ortex ﬁlament and illustration of the Biot-Savart law.CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 433 proof. However, you might feel more comfortable if we draw an analogy with electromagnetic theory. If the vortex ﬁlament in Figure 5.8 were instead visualizedas a wire carrying an electrical current I, then the magnetic ﬁeld strength dB induced at point Pby a segment of the wire dlwith the current moving in the direction of dlis dB=μI 4πdl×r |r|3(5.6) where μis the permeability of the medium surrounding the wire. Equation (5.6) is identical in form to Equation (5.5). Indeed, the Biot-Savart law is a generalresult of potential theory, and potential theory describes electromagnetic ﬁeldsas well as inviscid, incompressible ﬂows. In fact, our use of the word “induced”in describing velocities generated by the presence of vortices, sources, etc. is acarry-over from the study of electromagnetic ﬁelds induced by electrical currents.When developing their ﬁnite-wing theory during the period 1911–1918, Prandtland his colleagues even carried the electrical terminology over to the generationof drag, hence the term “induced” drag. Return again to our picture of the vortex ﬁlament in Figure 5.8. Keep in mind that this single vortex ﬁlament and the associated Biot-Savart law [Equation (5.5)]are simply conceptual aerodynamic tools to be used for synthesizing more com-plex ﬂows of an inviscid, incompressible ﬂuid. They are, for all practical purposes,a solution of the governing equation for inviscid, incompressible ﬂow—Laplace’sequation (see Section 3.7)—and, by themselves, are not of particular value. How-ever, when a number of vortex ﬁlaments are used in conjunction with a uniformfreestream, it is possible to synthesize a ﬂow which has a practical application.The ﬂow over a ﬁnite wing is one such example, as we will soon see. Let us apply the Biot-Savart law to a straight vortex ﬁlament of inﬁnite length, as sketched in Figure 5.9. The strength of the ﬁlament is /Gamma1. The velocity induced at point Pby the directed segment of the vortex ﬁlament dlis given by Figure 5.9 Velocity induced at point Pby an inﬁnite, straight vortex ﬁlament.434 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Equation (5.5). Hence, the velocity induced at Pby the entire vortex ﬁlament is V=/integraldisplay∞ −∞/Gamma1 4πdl×r |r|3(5.7) From the deﬁnition of the vector cross product (see Section 2.2), the direction of Vis downward in Figure 5.9. The magnitude of the velocity, V=|V|, is given by V=/Gamma1 4π/integraldisplay∞ −∞sinθ r2dl (5.8) In Figure 5.9, let hbe the perpendicular distance from point Pto the vortex ﬁlament. Then, from the geometry shown in Figure 5.9, r=h sinθ(5.9a) l=h tanθ(5.9b) dl=−h sin2θdθ (5.9c) Substituting Equations (5.9 atoc) in Equation (5.8), we have V=/Gamma1 4π/integraldisplay∞ −∞sinθ r2dl=−/Gamma1 4πh/integraldisplay0 πsinθdθ or V=/Gamma1 2πh(5.10) Thus, the velocity induced at a given point Pby an inﬁnite, straight vortex ﬁlament at a perpendicular distance hfrom Pis simply /Gamma1/2πh, which is precisely the result given by Equation (3.105) for a point vortex in two-dimensional ﬂow. [Notethat the minus sign in Equation (3.105) does not appear in Equation (5.10); this isbecause Vin Equation (5.10) is simply the absolute magnitude of V, and hence it is positive by deﬁnition.] Consider the semi-inﬁnite vortex ﬁlament shown in Figure 5.10. The ﬁlament extends from point Ato∞. Point Acan be considered a boundary of the ﬂow. LetPbe a point in the plane through Aperpendicular to the ﬁlament. Then, by Figure 5.10 Velocity induced at point Pby a semi-inﬁnite straight vortex ﬁlament.CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 435 an integration similar to that above (try it yourself), the velocity induced at Pby the semi-inﬁnite vortex ﬁlament is V=/Gamma1 4πh(5.11) We use Equation (5.11) in the next section. The great German mathematician, physicist, and physician Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) was the ﬁrst to make use of the vortex ﬁlament concept in the analysis of inviscid, incompressible ﬂow. In the process, he established severalbasic principles of vortex behavior which have become known as Helmholtz’svortex theorems: 1.The strength of a vortex ﬁlament is constant along its length. 2.A vortex ﬁlament cannot end in a ﬂuid; it must extend to the boundaries of the ﬂuid (which can be ±∞) or form a closed path. We make use of these theorems in the following sections. Finally, let us introduce the concept of lift distribution along the span of a ﬁnite wing. Consider a given spanwise location y 1, where the local chord is c, the local geometric angle of attack is α, and the airfoil section is a given shape. The lift per unit span at this location is L/prime(y1). Now consider another location y2 along the span, where c,α, and the airfoil shape may be different. (Most ﬁnite wings have a variable chord, with the exception of a simple rectangular wing.Also, many wings are geometrically twisted so that αis different at different spanwise locations—so-called geometric twist. If the tip is at a lower αthan the root, the wing is said to have washout; if the tip is at a higher αthan the root, the wing has washin. In addition, the wings on a number of modern airplanes have different airfoil sections along the span, with different values of α L=0;this is called aerodynamic twist.) Consequently, the lift per unit span at this different location, L/prime(y2),will, in general, be different from L/prime(y1).Therefore, there is a distribution of lift per unit span along the wing, that is, L/prime=L/prime(y),as sketched in Figure 5.11. In turn, the circulation is also a function of y, /Gamma1(y)=L/prime(y)/ρ∞V∞. Note from Figure 5.11 that the lift distribution goes to zero at the tips; that isbecause there is a pressure equalization from the bottom to the top of the wingprecisely at y=−b/2 and b/2,and hence no lift is created at these points.

It is addressed in the following sections. In summary, we wish to calculate the induced drag, the total lift, and the lift distribution for a ﬁnite wing. This is the purpose of the remainder of this chapter. 5.3 PRANDTL’S CLASSICAL LIFTING-LINE THEORY The ﬁrst practical theory for predicting the aerodynamic properties of a ﬁnite wingwas developed by Ludwig Prandtl and his colleagues at G¨ ottingen, Germany,during the period 1911–1918, spanning World War I. The utility of Prandtl’stheory is so great that it is still in use today for preliminary calculations of ﬁnite-wing characteristics. The purpose of this section is to describe Prandtl’s theory andto lay the groundwork for the modern numerical methods described in subsequentsections. Prandtl reasoned as follows. A vortex ﬁlament of strength /Gamma1that is somehow bound to a ﬁxed location in a ﬂow—a so-called bound vortex—will experience aforce L /prime=ρ∞V∞/Gamma1from the Kutta-Joukowski theorem. This bound vortex is in contrast to a free vortex, which moves with the same ﬂuid elements throughout a ﬂow. Therefore, let us replace a ﬁnite wing of span bwith a bound vortex, extending from y=− b/2 to y=b/2,as sketched in Figure 5.12. However, due to Helmholtz’s theorem, a vortex ﬁlament cannot end in the ﬂuid. Therefore,assume the vortex ﬁlament continues as two free vortices trailing downstreamfrom the wing tips to inﬁnity, as also shown in Figure 5.12. This vortex (thebound plus the two free) is in the shape of a horseshoe, and therefore is called ahorseshoe vortex. A single horseshoe vortex is shown in Figure 5.13. Consider the downwash winduced along the bound vortex from −b/2 to b/2 by the horseshoe vortex. Examining Figure 5.13, we see that the bound vortex induces no velocity alongitself; however, the two trailing vortices both contribute to the induced velocity Figure 5.12 Replacement of the ﬁnite wing with a bound vortex.CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 437 Figure 5.13 Downwash distribution along the yaxis for a single horseshoe vortex. along the bound vortex, and both contributions are in the downward direction. Consistent with the xyzcoordinate system in Figure 5.13, such a downward ve- locity is negative; that is, w(which is in the zdirection) is a negative value when directed downward and a positive value when directed upward. If the origin istaken at the center of the bound vortex, then the velocity at any point yalong the bound vortex induced by the trailing semi-inﬁnite vortices is, from Equa-tion (5.11), w(y)=−/Gamma1 4π(b/2+y)−/Gamma1 4π(b/2−y)(5.12) In Equation (5.12), the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is the contribution from theleft trailing vortex (trailing from −b/2), and the second term is the contribution from the right trailing vortex (trailing from b/2). Equation (5.12) reduces to w(y)=−/Gamma1 4πb (b/2)2−y2(5.13) This variation of w(y)is sketched in Figure 5.13. Note that wapproaches −∞ asyapproaches −b/2 or b/2. The downwash distribution due to the single horseshoe vortex shown in Fig- ure 5.13 does not realistically simulate that of a ﬁnite wing; the downwash ap-proaching an inﬁnite value at the tips is especially disconcerting. During the earlyevolution of ﬁnite-wing theory, this problem perplexed Prandtl and his colleagues.After several years of effort, a resolution of this problem was obtained which, inhindsight, was simple and straightforward. Instead of representing the wing by asingle horseshoe vortex, let us superimpose a large number of horseshoe vortices,each with a different length of the bound vortex, but with all the bound vortices438 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 5.14 Superposition of a ﬁnite number of horseshoe vortices along the lifting line. coincident along a single line, called the lifting line. This concept is illustrated in Figure 5.14, where only three horseshoe vortices are shown for the sake of clarity. In Figure 5.14, a horseshoe vortex of strength d/Gamma11is shown, where the bound vortex spans the entire wing from −b/2 to b/2 (from point Ato point F). Super- imposed on this is a second horseshoe vortex of strength d/Gamma12, where its bound vortex spans only part of the wing, from point Bto point E. Finally, superimposed on this is a third horseshoe vortex of strength d/Gamma13, where its bound vortex spans only the part of the wing from point Cto point D. As a result, the circulation varies along the line of bound vortices—the lifting line deﬁned above. Along AB andEF, where only one vortex is present, the circulation is d/Gamma11. However, along BCandDE, where two vortices are superimposed, the circulation is the sum of their strengths d/Gamma11+d/Gamma12. Along CD, three vortices are superimposed, and hence the circulation is d/Gamma11+d/Gamma12+d/Gamma13. This variation of /Gamma1along the lifting line is denoted by the vertical bars in Figure 5.14. Also, note from Figure 5.14 that wenow have a series of trailing vortices distributed over the span, rather than justtwo vortices trailing downstream of the tips as shown in Figure 5.13. The seriesof trailing vortices in Figure 5.14 represents pairs of vortices, each pair associatedwith a given horseshoe vortex. Note that the strength of each trailing vortex isequal to the change in circulation along the lifting line. Let us extrapolate Figure 5.14 to the case where an inﬁnite number of horse- shoe vortices are superimposed along the lifting line, each with a vanishinglysmall strength d/Gamma1. This case is illustrated in Figure 5.15. Note that the vertical bars in Figure 5.14 have now become a continuous distribution of /Gamma1(y)along the lifting line in Figure 5.15. The value of the circulation at the origin is /Gamma1 Also, note that the ﬁnite number of trailing vortices in Figure 5.14 have becomeacontinuous vortex sheet trailing downstream of the lifting line in Figure 5.15. This vortex sheet is parallel to the direction of V ∞. The total strength of the sheet integrated across the span of the wing is zero, because it consists of pairs oftrailing vortices of equal strength but in opposite directions.CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 439 Figure 5.15 Superposition of an inﬁnite number of horseshoe vortices along the lifting line. Let us single out an inﬁnitesimally small segment of the lifting line dylocated at the coordinate yas shown in Figure 5.15. The circulation at yis/Gamma1(y), and the change in circulation over the segment dyisd/Gamma1=(d/Gamma1/dy)dy. In turn, the strength of the trailing vortex at ymust equal the change in circulation d/Gamma1 along the lifting line; this is simply an extrapolation of our result obtained for the strength of the ﬁnite trailing vortices in Figure 5.14. Consider more closelythe trailing vortex of strength d/Gamma1that intersects the lifting line at coordinate y, as shown in Figure 5.15. Also consider the arbitrary location y 0along the lifting line. Any segment of the trailing vortex dxwill induce a velocity at y0with a magnitude and direction given by the Biot-Savart law, Equation (5.5). In turn, thevelocity dwaty 0induced by the entire semi-inﬁnite trailing vortex located at y is given by Equation (5.11), which in terms of the picture given in Figure 5.15yields dw=−(d/Gamma1/dy)dy 4π(y0−y)(5.14) The minus sign in Equation (5.14) is needed for consistency with the pictureshown in Figure 5.15; for the trailing vortex shown, the direction of dwaty 0is upward and hence is a positive value, whereas /Gamma1is decreasing in the ydirection, making d/Gamma1/dya negative quantity. The minus sign in Equation (5.14) makes the positive dwconsistent with the negative d/Gamma1/dy. The total velocity winduced at y0by the entire trailing vortex sheet is the summation of Equation (5.14) over all the vortex ﬁlaments, that is, the integral ofEquation (5.14) from −b/2 to b/2: w(y0)=−1 4π/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2(d/Gamma1/dy)dy y0−y(5.15)440 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Equation (5.15) is important in that it gives the value of the downwash at y0due to all the trailing vortices. (Keep in mind that although we label was downwash, wis treated as positive in the upward direction in order to be consistent with the normal convention in an xyzrectangular coordinate system.) Pause for a moment and assess the status of our discussion so far. We have replaced the ﬁnite wing with the model of a lifting line along which the circulation /Gamma1(y)varies continuously, as shown in Figure 5.15. In turn, we have obtained an expression for the downwash along the lifting line, given by Equation (5.15).However, our central problem still remains to be solved; that is, we want tocalculate /Gamma1(y)for a given ﬁnite wing, along with its corresponding total lift and induced drag. Therefore, we must press on. Return to Figure 5.6, which shows the local airfoil section of a ﬁnite wing. Assume this section is located at the arbitrary spanwise station y From Figure 5.6, the induced angle of attack αiis given by αi(y0)=tan−1/parenleftbigg−w( y0) V∞/parenrightbigg (5.16) [Note in Figure 5.6 that wis downward, and hence is a negative quantity. Since αiin Figure 5.6 is positive, the negative sign in Equation (5.16) is necessary for consistency.] Generally, wis much smaller than V∞, and hence αiis a small angle, on the order of a few degrees at most. For small angles, Equation (5.16) yields αi(y0)=−w(y0) V∞(5.17) Substituting Equation (5.15) into (5.17), we obtain αi(y0)=1 4πV∞/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2(d/Gamma1/dy)dy y0−y(5.18) that is, an expression for the induced angle of attack in terms of the circulationdistribution /Gamma1(y)along the wing. Consider again the effective angle of attack α eff, as shown in Figure 5.6. As explained in Section 5.1, αeffis the angle of attack actually seen by the local airfoil section. Since the downwash varies across the span, then αeffis also variable; αeff=αeff(y0). The lift coefﬁcient for the airfoil section located at y=y0is cl=a0[αeff(y0)−αL=0]=2π[αeff(y0)−αL=0] (5.19) In Equation (5.19), the local section lift slope a0has been replaced by the thin airfoil theoretical value of 2π( rad−1). Also, for a wing with aerodynamic twist, the angle of zero lift αL=0in Equation (5.19) varies with y0. If there is no aerodynamic twist, αL=0is constant across the span. In any event, αL=0is a known property of the local airfoil sections. From the deﬁnition of lift coefﬁcient and from theKutta-Joukowski theorem, we have, for the local airfoil section located at y 0, L/prime=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞c(y0)cl=ρ∞V∞/Gamma1(y0) (5.20)CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 441 From Equation (5.20), we obtain cl=2/Gamma1(y0) V∞c(y0)(5.21) Substituting Equation (5.21) into (5.19) and solving for αeff, we have αeff=/Gamma1(y0) πV∞c(y0)+αL=0 (5.22) The above results come into focus if we refer to Equation (5.1): αeff=α−αi (5.1) Substituting Equations (5.18) and (5.22) into (5.1), we obtain α(y0)=/Gamma1(y0) πV∞c(y0)+αL=0(y0)+1 4πV∞/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2(d/Gamma1/dy)dy y0−y(5.23) thefundamental equation of Prandtl’s lifting-line theory; it simply states that the geometric angle of attack is equal to the sum of the effective angle plus the induced angle of attack. In Equation (5.23), αeffis expressed in terms of /Gamma1, and αiis expressed in terms of an integral containing d/Gamma1/dy. Hence, Equation (5.23) is an integro-differential equation, in which the only unknown is /Gamma1; all the other quantities, α,c,V∞, andαL=0, are known for a ﬁnite wing of given design at a given geometric angle of attack in a freestream with given velocity. Thus, asolution of Equation (5.23) yields /Gamma1=/Gamma1(y 0), where y0ranges along the span from−b/2 to b/2. The solution /Gamma1=/Gamma1(y0)obtained from Equation (5.23) gives us the three main aerodynamic characteristics of a ﬁnite wing, as follows: 1.The lift distribution is obtained from the Kutta-Joukowski theorem: L/prime(y0)=ρ∞V∞/Gamma1(y0) (5.24) 2.The total lift is obtained by integrating Equation (5.24) over the span: L=/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2L/prime(y)dy or L=ρ∞V∞/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2/Gamma1(y)dy (5.25) (Note that we have dropped the subscript on y, for simplicity.) The lift coefﬁcient follows immediately from Equation (5.25): CL=L q∞S=2 V∞S/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2/Gamma1(y)dy (5.26)442 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 3.The induced drag is obtained by inspection of Figure 5.4. The induced drag per unit span is D/prime i=L/prime isinαi Sinceαiis small, this relation becomes D/prime i=L/prime iαi (5.27) The total induced drag is obtained by integrating Equation (5.27) over thespan: D i=/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2L/prime(y)αi(y)dy (5.28) orDi=ρ∞V∞/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2/Gamma1(y)αi(y)dy (5.29) In turn, the induced drag coefﬁcient is CD,i=Di q∞S=2 V∞S/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2/Gamma1(y)αi(y)dy (5.30) In Equations (5.27) to (5.30), αi(y)is obtained from Equation (5.18). Therefore, in Prandtl’s lifting-line theory the solution of Equation (5.23) for/Gamma1(y)is clearly the key to obtaining the aerodynamic characteristics of a ﬁnite wing. Before discussing the general solution of this equation, let usconsider a special case, as outlined below. 5.3.1 Elliptical Lift Distribution Consider a circulation distribution given by /Gamma1(y)=/Gamma10/radicalBigg 1−/parenleftbigg2y b/parenrightbigg2 (5.31) In Equation (5.31), note the following: 1./Gamma10is the circulation at the origin, as shown in Figure 5.15. 2.The circulation varies elliptically with distance yalong the span; hence, it is designated as an elliptical circulation distribution. Since L/prime(y)=ρ∞V∞/Gamma1(y), we also have L/prime(y)=ρ∞V∞/Gamma10/radicalBigg 1−/parenleftbigg2y b/parenrightbigg2 Hence, we are dealing with an elliptical lift distribution. 3./Gamma1(b/2)=/Gamma1(−b/2)=0. Thus, the circulation, hence lift, properly goes to zero at the wing tips, as shown in Figure 5.15. We have not obtained Equation (5.31) as a direct solution of Equation (5.23); rather, we aresimply stipulating a lift distribution that is elliptic. We now ask thequestion, ‘What are the aerodynamic properties of a ﬁnite wing with suchan elliptic lift distribution?’CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 443 First, let us calculate the downwash. Differentiating Equation (5.31), we obtain d/Gamma1 dy=−4/Gamma10 b2y (1−4y2/b2)1/2(5.32) Substituting Equation (5.32) into (5.15), we have w(y0)=/Gamma10 πb2/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2y (1−4y2/b2)1/2(y0−y)dy (5.33) The integral can be evaluated easily by making the substitution y=b 2cosθdy=−b 2sinθdθ Hence, Equation (5.33) becomes w(θ 0)=−/Gamma10 2πb/integraldisplay0 πcosθ cosθ0−cosθdθ or w(θ 0)=−/Gamma10 2πb/integraldisplayπ 0cosθ cosθ−cosθ0dθ (5.34) The integral in Equation (5.34) is the standard form given by Equation (4.26) for n=1. Hence, Equation (5.34) becomes w(θ 0)=−/Gamma10 2b(5.35) which states the interesting and important result that the downwash is constant over the span for an elliptical lift distribution. In turn, from Equation (5.17), weobtain, for the induced angle of attack, α i=−w V∞=/Gamma10 2bV∞(5.36) For an elliptic lift distribution, the induced angle of attack is also constant alongthe span. Note from Equations (5.35) and (5.36) that both the downwash andinduced angle of attack go to zero as the wing span becomes inﬁnite—which isconsistent with our previous discussions on airfoil theory. A more useful expression for α ican be obtained as follows. Substituting Equation (5.31) into (5.25), we have L=ρ∞V∞/Gamma10/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2/parenleftbigg 1−4y2 b2/parenrightbigg1/2 dy (5.37)444 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Again, using the transformation y=(b/2)cosθ, Equation (5.37) readily inte- grates to L=ρ∞V∞/Gamma10b 2/integraldisplayπ 0sin2θdθ=ρ∞V∞/Gamma10b 4π (5.38) Solving Equation (5.38) for /Gamma10, we have /Gamma10=4L ρ∞V∞bπ(5.39) However, L=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞SC L. Hence, Equation (5.39) becomes /Gamma10=2V∞SC L bπ(5.40) Substituting Equation (5.40) into (5.36), we obtain αi=2V∞SC L bπ1 2bV∞ or αi=SC L πb2(5.41) An important geometric property of a ﬁnite wing is the aspect ratio, denoted by AR and deﬁned as AR≡b2 S Hence, Equation (5.41) becomes αi=CL πAR(5.42) Equation (5.42) is a useful expression for the induced angle of attack, as shown below. The induced drag coefﬁcient is obtained from Equation (5.30), noting that αi is constant: CD,i=2αi V∞S/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2/Gamma1(y)dy=2αi/Gamma10 V∞Sb 2/integraldisplayπ 0sin2θdθ=πα i/Gamma10b 2V∞S(5.42a) Substituting Equations (5.40) and (5.42) into (5.42 a), we obtain CD,i=πb 2V∞S/parenleftbiggCL πAR/parenrightbigg2V∞SC L bπ or CD,i=C2 L πAR(5.43)CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 445 Equation (5.43) is an important result. It states that the induced drag coefﬁcient is directly proportional to the square of the lift coefﬁcient. The dependence ofinduced drag on the lift is not surprising, for the following reason. In Section 5.1,we saw that induced drag is a consequence of the presence of the wing-tip vortices,which in turn are produced by the difference in pressure between the lower andupper wing surfaces. The lift is produced by this same pressure difference. Hence,induced drag is intimately related to the production of lift on a ﬁnite wing; indeed,induced drag is frequently called the drag due to lift. Equation (5.43) dramatically illustrates this point. Clearly, an airplane cannot generate lift for free; the induceddrag is the price for the generation of lift. The power required from an aircraftengine to overcome the induced drag is simply the power required to generate thelift of the aircraft. Also, note that because C D,i∝C2 L, the induced drag coefﬁcient increases rapidly as CLincreases and becomes a substantial part of the total drag coefﬁcient when CLis high (e.g., when the airplane is ﬂying slowly such as on takeoff or landing). Even at relatively high cruising speeds, induced drag istypically 25 percent of the total drag. Another important aspect of induced drag is evident in Equation (5.43); that is,C D,iisinversely proportional to aspect ratio. Hence, to reduce the induced drag, we want a ﬁnite wing with the highest possible aspect ratio. Wings withhigh and low aspect ratios are sketched in Figure 5.16. Unfortunately, the designof very high aspect ratio wings with sufﬁcient structural strength is difﬁcult.Therefore, the aspect ratio of a conventional aircraft is a compromise betweenconﬂicting aerodynamic and structural requirements. It is interesting to note thatthe aspect ratio of the 1903 Wright Flyer was 6 and that today the aspect ratiosof conventional subsonic aircraft range typically from 6 to 8. (Exceptions arethe Lockheed U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft with AR =14.3 and sailplanes with aspect ratios as high as 51. For example, the Schempp-Hirth Figure 5.16 Schematic of high- and low-aspect-ratio wings.446 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Nimbus 4 sailplane, designed in 1994 with over 100 built by 2004, has an aspect ratio of 39. The ETA sailplane, designed in 2000 with 6 built by 2004, has anaspect ratio of 51.3.) Another property of the elliptical lift distribution is as follows. Consider a wing with no geometric twist (i.e., αis constant along the span) and no aero- dynamic twist (i.e., α L=0is constant along the span). From Equation (5.42), we have seen that αiis constant along the span. Hence, αeff=α−αiis also constant along the span. Since the local section lift coefﬁcient clis given by cl=a0(αeff−αL=0) then assuming that a0is the same for each section ( a0=2πfrom thin airfoil theory), clmust be constant along the span. The lift per unit span is given by L/prime(y)=q∞ccl (5.44) Solving Equation (5.44) for the chord, we have c(y)=L/prime(y) q∞cl(5.45) In Equation (5.45), q∞andclare constant along the span. However, L/prime(y)varies elliptically along the span. Thus, Equation (5.45) dictates that for such an ellipticlift distribution, the chord must vary elliptically along the span; that is, for the conditions given above, the wing planform is elliptical. The related characteristics—the elliptic lift distribution, the elliptic planform, and the constant downwash—are sketched in Figure 5.17. Although an ellipticallift distribution may appear to be a restricted, isolated case, in reality it gives areasonable approximation for the induced drag coefﬁcient for an arbitrary ﬁnitewing. The form of C D,igiven by Equation (5.43) is only slightly modiﬁed for Figure 5.17 Illustration of the related quantities: an elliptic lift distribution, elliptic planform, and constant downwash.CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 447 the general case. Let us now consider the case of a ﬁnite wing with a general lift distribution. 5.3.2 General Lift Distribution Consider the transformation y=−b 2cosθ (5.46) where the coordinate in the spanwise direction is now given by θ, with 0 ≤θ≤π. In terms of θ, the elliptic lift distribution given by Equation (5.31) is written as /Gamma1(θ)=/Gamma10sinθ (5.47) Equation (5.47) hints that a Fourier sine series would be an appropriate expressionfor the general circulation distribution along an arbitrary ﬁnite wing. Hence,assume for the general case that /Gamma1(θ)=2bV ∞N/summationdisplay 1Ansinnθ (5.48) where as many terms Nin the series can be taken as we desire for accuracy. The coefﬁcients An(where n=1,..., N) in Equation (5.48) are unknowns; however, they must satisfy the fundamental equation of Prandtl’s lifting-line theory; that is,theA n’s must satisfy Equation (5.23). Differentiating Equation (5.48), we obtain d/Gamma1 dy=d/Gamma1 dθdθ dy=2bV∞N/summationdisplay 1nA ncosnθdθ dy(5.49) Substituting Equations (5.48) and (5.49) into (5.23), we obtain α(θ 0)=2b πc(θ0)N/summationdisplay 1Ansinnθ0+αL=0(θ0)+1 π/integraldisplayπ 0/summationtextN 1nA ncosnθ cosθ−cosθ0dθ(5.50) The integral in Equation (5.50) is the standard form given by Equation (4.26).Hence, Equation (5.50) becomes α(θ 0)=2b πc(θ0)N/summationdisplay 1Ansinnθ0+αL=0(θ0)+N/summationdisplay 1nA nsinnθ0 sinθ0(5.51) Examine Equation (5.51) closely. It is evaluated at a given spanwise location;hence, θ 0is speciﬁed. In turn, b,c(θ0), and αL=0(θ0)are known quantities from the geometry and airfoil section of the ﬁnite wing. The only unknowns in Equa-tion (5.51) are the A n’s. Hence, written at a given spanwise location (a speciﬁed θ0), Equation (5.51) is one algebraic equation with Nunknowns, A1,A2,..., An. However, let us choose Ndifferent spanwise stations, and let us evaluate Equa- tion (5.51) at each of these Nstations. We then obtain a system of Nindependent448 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow algebraic equations with Nunknowns, namely, A1,A2,..., AN. In this fashion, actual numerical values are obtained for the An’s—numerical values that ensure that the general circulation distribution given by Equation (5.48) satisﬁes the fundamental equation of ﬁnite-wing theory, Equation (5.23). Now that /Gamma1(θ) is known via Equation (5.48), the lift coefﬁcient for the ﬁnite wing follows immediately from the substitution of Equation (5.48) into (5.26): CL=2 V∞S/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2/Gamma1(y)dy=2b2 SN/summationdisplay 1An/integraldisplayπ 0sinnθsinθdθ (5.52) In Equation (5.52), the integral is /integraldisplayπ 0sinnθsinθdθ=/braceleftbiggπ/2 for n=1 0 for n/negationslash=1 Hence, Equation (5.52) becomes CL=A1πb2 S=A1πAR (5.53) Note that CLdepends only on the leading coefﬁcient of the Fourier series expan- sion. (However, although CLdepends on A1only, we must solve for all the An’s simultaneously in order to obtain A1.) The induced drag coefﬁcient is obtained from the substitution of Equa- tion (5.48) into Equation (5.30) as follows: CD,i=2 V∞S/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2/Gamma1(y)αi(y)dy (5.54) =2b2 S/integraldisplayπ 0/parenleftBiggN/summationdisplay 1Ansinnθ/parenrightBigg αi(θ)sinθdθ The induced angle of attack αi(θ)in Equation (5.54) is obtained from the substi- tution of Equations (5.46) and (5.49) into (5.18), which yields αi(y0)=1 4πV∞/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2(d/Gamma1/dy)dy y0−y =1 πN/summationdisplay 1nA n/integraldisplayπ 0cosnθ cosθ−cosθ0dθ (5.55) The integral in Equation (5.55) is the standard form given by Equation (4.26).Hence, Equation (5.55) becomes α i(θ0)=N/summationdisplay 1nA nsinnθ0 sinθ0(5.56) In Equation (5.56), θ0is simply a dummy variable which ranges from 0 to π across the span of the wing; it can therefore be replaced by θ, and Equation (5.56)CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 449 can be written as αi(θ)=N/summationdisplay 1nA nsinnθ sinθ(5.57) Substituting Equation (5.57) into (5.54), we have CD,i=2b2 S/integraldisplayπ 0/parenleftBiggN/summationdisplay 1Ansinnθ/parenrightBigg/parenleftBiggN/summationdisplay 1nA nsinnθ/parenrightBigg dθ (5.58) Examine Equation (5.58) closely; it involves the product of two summations.

Note that δ≥0; hence, the factor 1 +δin Equa- tion (5.61) is either greater than 1 or at least equal to 1. Let us deﬁne a span efﬁciency factor, e, ase=(1+δ)−1. Then Equation (5.61) can be written as CD,i=C2 L πeAR(5.62) where e≤1. Comparing Equations (5.61) and (5.62) for the general lift distri- bution with Equation (5.43) for the elliptical lift distribution, note that δ=0 and e=1 for the elliptical lift distribution. Hence, the lift distribution which yields minimum induced drag is the elliptical lift distribution. This is why we have a practical interest in the elliptical lift distribution.450 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 5.18 Various planforms for straight wings. Recall that for a wing with no aerodynamic twist and no geometric twist, an elliptical lift distribution is generated by a wing with an elliptical planform, as sketched at the top of Figure 5.18. Several aircraft have been designed in thepast with elliptical wings; the most famous, perhaps, being the British Spitﬁrefrom World War II, shown in Figure 5.19. However, elliptic planforms are moreexpensive to manufacture than, say, a simple rectangular wing as sketched inthe middle of Figure 5.18. On the other hand, a rectangular wing generates alift distribution far from optimum. A compromise is the tapered wing shownat the bottom of Figure 5.18. The tapered wing can be designed with a taperratio, that is, tip chord/root chord ≡c t/cr, such that the lift distribution closely approximates the elliptic case. The variation of δas a function of taper ratio for wings of different aspect ratio is illustrated in Figure 5.20. Such calculations ofδwere ﬁrst performed by the famous English aerodynamicist, Hermann Glauert and published in Reference 18 in the year 1926. Glauert used only four terms inthe series expansion given in Equation (5.60). The results shown in Figure 5.20are based on the recent computer calculations carried out by B.W. McCormickat Penn State University using the equivalent of 50 terms in the series expansion.Note from Figure 5.20 that a tapered wing can be designed with an induced dragcoefﬁcient reasonably close to the minimum value. In addition, tapered wingswith straight leading and trailing edges are considerably easier to manufacturethan elliptic planforms. Therefore, most conventional aircraft employ taperedrather than elliptical wing planforms. 5.3.3 Effect of Aspect Ratio Returning to Equations (5.61) and (5.62), note that the induced drag coefﬁcientfor a ﬁnite wing with a general lift distribution is inversely proportional to theCHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 451 Figure 5.19 Three views of the Supermarine Spitﬁre, a famous British World War II ﬁghter. aspect ratio, as was discussed earlier in conjunction with the case of the elliptic lift distribution. Note that AR, which typically varies from 6 to 22 for standardsubsonic airplanes and sailplanes, has a much stronger effect on C D,ithan the value of δ, which from Figure 5.20 varies only by about 10 percent over the practical range of taper ratio. Hence, the primary design factor for minimizinginduced drag is not the closeness to an elliptical lift distribution, but rather, theability to make the aspect ratio as large as possible. The determination that C D,iis inversely proportional to AR was one of the great victories of Prandtl’s lifting-linetheory. In 1915, Prandtl veriﬁed this result with a series of classic experimentswherein the lift and drag of seven rectangular wings with different aspect ratios452 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 5.20 Induced drag factor δas a function of taper ratio. Computer calculations using the equivalent of 50 terms in the series expansion, Equation (5.60). (Data Source: McCormick, B. W., Aerodynamics, Aeronautics, and Flight Mechanics, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1979). were measured. The data are given in Figure 5.21. Recall from Equation (5.4), that the total drag of a ﬁnite wing is given by CD=cd+C2 L πeAR(5.63) The parabolic variation of CDwith CLas expressed in Equation (5.63) is re- ﬂected in the data of Figure 5.21. This is a plot of lift coefﬁcient versus dragcoefﬁcient, and is called a drag polar. Equation (5.63) is similarly the equation of a drag polar. If we consider two wings with different aspect ratios AR 1and AR 2, Equation (5.63) gives the drag coefﬁcients CD,1andCD,2for the two wings as CD,1=cd+C2 L πeAR 1(5.64a) and CD,2=cd+C2 L πeAR 2(5.64b) Assume that the wings are at the same CL. Also, since the airfoil section is the same for both wings, cdis essentially the same. Moreover, the variation of e between the wings is only a few percent and can be ignored. Hence, subtractingEquation (5.64b ) from (5.64 a), we obtain C D,1=CD,2+C2 L πe/parenleftbigg1 AR 1−1 AR 2/parenrightbigg (5.65) Equation (5.65) can be used to scale the data of a wing with aspect ratio AR 2to correspond to the case of another aspect ratio AR 1. For example, Prandtl scaledCHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 453 Figure 5.21 Prandtl’s classic rectangular wing data for seven different aspect ratios from 1 to 7; variation of lift coefﬁcient versus drag coefﬁcient.For historical interest, we reproduce here Prandtl’sactual graphs. Note that, in his nomenclature, C a=lift coefﬁcient and Cw=drag coefﬁcient. Also, the numbers on both the ordinate andabscissa are 100 times the actual values of thecoefﬁcients. (Source: Prandtl, L., Applications of Modern Hydrodynamics to Aeronautics, NACA Report No. 116, 1921). the data of Figure 5.21 to correspond to a wing with an aspect ratio of 5. For this case, Equation (5.65) becomes CD,1=CD,2+C2 L πe/parenleftbigg1 5−1 AR 2/parenrightbigg (5.66) Inserting the respective values of CD,2and AR 2from Figure 5.21 into Equa- tion (5.66), Prandtl found that the resulting data for CD,1, versus CLcollapsed to essentially the same curve, as shown in Figure 5.22. Hence, the inverse depen-dence of C D,ion AR was substantially veriﬁed as early as 1915. There are two primary differences between airfoil and ﬁnite-wing properties. We have discussed one difference, namely, a ﬁnite wing generates induced drag.However, a second major difference appears in the lift slope. In Figure 4.9, the liftslope for an airfoil was deﬁned as a 0≡dcl/dα. Let us denote the lift slope for a454 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 5.22 Data of Figure 5.21 scaled by Prandtl to an aspect ratio of 5. ﬁnite wing as a≡dC L/dα. When the lift slope of a ﬁnite wing is compared with that of its airfoil section, we ﬁnd that a<a0. To see this more clearly, return to Figure 5.6, which illustrates the inﬂuence of downwash on the ﬂow over a local airfoil section of a ﬁnite wing. Note that although the geometric angle of attack ofthe ﬁnite wing is α, the airfoil section effectively senses a smaller angle of attack, namely, α eff, where αeff=α−αi. For the time being, consider an elliptic wing with no twist; hence, αiandαeffare both constant along the span. Moreover, cl is also constant along the span, and therefore CL=cl. Assume that we plot CL for the ﬁnite wing versus αeff, as shown at the top of Figure 5.23. Because we are using αeffthe lift slope corresponds to that for an inﬁnite wing a0. However, in real life, our naked eyes cannot see αeff; instead, what we actually observe is a ﬁnite wing with a certain angle between the chord line and the relative wind;that is, in practice, we always observe the geometric angle of attack α. Hence, C L for a ﬁnite wing is generally given as a function of α, as sketched at the bottom of Figure 5.23. Since α>α eff, the bottom abscissa is stretched, and hence the bottom lift curve is less inclined; it has a slope equal to a, and Figure 5.23 clearly shows that a<a0. The effect of a ﬁnite wing is to reduce the lift slope. Also, recall that at zero lift, there are no induced effects; that is, αi=CD,i=0. Thus, when CL=0,α=αeff. As a result, αL=0is the same for the ﬁnite and the inﬁnite wings, as shown in Figure 5.23.CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 455 Figure 5.23 Lift curves for an inﬁnite wing versus a ﬁnite elliptic wing. The values of a0andaare related as follows. From the top of Figure 5.23, dC L d(α−αi)=a0 Integrating, we ﬁnd CL=a0(α−αi)+const (5.67) Substituting Equation (5.42) into (5.67), we obtain CL=a0/parenleftbigg α−CL πAR/parenrightbigg +const (5.68) Differentiating Equation (5.68) with respect to α, and solving for dC L/dα, we obtain dC L dα=a=a0 1+a0/πAR(5.69) Equation (5.69) gives the desired relation between a0andafor an elliptic ﬁnite wing. For a ﬁnite wing of general planform, Equation (5.69) is slightly modiﬁed, as given below: a=a0 1+(a0/πAR)(1 +τ)(5.70)456 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 5.24 Prandtl’s classic rectangular wing data. Variation of lift coefﬁcient with angle of attack for seven different aspect ratios from 1 to 7. Nomenclature andscale are the same as given in Figure 5.21. In Equation (5.70), τis a function of the Fourier coefﬁcients An. Values of τwere ﬁrst calculated by Glauert in the early 1920s and were published in Reference 18, which should be consulted for more details. Values of τtypically range between 0.05 and 0.25. Of most importance in Equations (5.69) and (5.70) is the aspect-ratio varia- tion. Note that for low-AR wings, a substantial difference can exist between a0 anda. However, as AR →∞ ,a→a0. The effect of aspect ratio on the lift curve is dramatically shown in Figure 5.24, which gives classic data obtained onrectangular wings by Prandtl in 1915. Note the reduction in dC L/dαas AR is reduced. Moreover, using the equations obtained above, Prandtl scaled the data inFigure 5.24 to correspond to an aspect ratio of 5; his results collapsed to essentiallythe same curve, as shown in Figure 5.25. In this manner, the aspect-ratio variationgiven in Equations (5.69) and (5.70) was conﬁrmed as early as the year 1915. 5.3.4 Physical Signiﬁcance Consider again the basic model underlying Prandtl’s lifting-line theory. Returnto Figure 5.15 and study it carefully. An inﬁnite number of inﬁnitesimally weakhorseshoe vortices are superimposed in such a fashion as to generate a lifting linewhich spans the wing, along with a vortex sheet which trails downstream. ThisCHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 457 Figure 5.25 Data of Figure 5.24 scaled by Prandtl to an aspect ratio of 5. trailing-vortex sheet is the instrument that induces downwash at the lifting line. At ﬁrst thought, you might consider this model to be somewhat abstract—a mathe-matical convenience that somehow produces surprisingly useful results. However,to the contrary, the model shown in Figure 5.15 has real physical signiﬁcance.To see this more clearly, return to Figure 5.3. Note that in the three-dimensionalﬂow over a ﬁnite wing, the streamlines leaving the trailing edge from the top andbottom surfaces are in different directions; that is, there is a discontinuity in thetangential velocity at the trailing edge. We know from Chapter 4 that a discontin-uous change in tangential velocity is theoretically allowed across a vortex sheet.In real life, such discontinuities do not exist; rather, the different velocities atthe trailing edge generate a thin region of large velocity gradients—a thin regionof shear ﬂow with very large vorticity. Hence, a sheet of vorticity actually trailsdownstream from the trailing edge of a ﬁnite wing. This sheet tends to roll up atthe edges and helps to form the wing-tip vortices sketched in Figure 5.4. Thus,Prandtl’s lifting-line model with its trailing-vortex sheet is physically consistentwith the actual ﬂow downstream of a ﬁnite wing. EXAMPLE 5.1 Consider a ﬁnite wing with an aspect ratio of 8 and a taper ratio of 0.8. The airfoil section is thin and symmetric. Calculate the lift and induced drag coefﬁcients for the wing whenit is at an angle of attack of 5 ◦. Assume that δ=τ.458 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow ■Solution From Figure 5.20, δ=0.055. Hence, from the stated assumption, τalso equals 0.055. From Equation (5.70), assuming a0=2πfrom thin airfoil theory, a=a0 1+a0/πAR(1+τ)=2π 1+2π(1.055)/8π=4.97 rad−1 =0.0867 degree−1 Since the airfoil is symmetric, αL=0=0◦. Thus, CL=aα=(0.0867 degree−1(5◦)=0.4335 From Equation (5.61), CD,i=C2 L πAR(1+δ)=(0.4335)2(1+0.055) 8π=0.00789 EXAMPLE 5.2 Consider a rectangular wing with an aspect ratio of 6, an induced drag factor δ=0.055, and a zero-lift angle of attack of −2◦. At an angle of attack of 3.4◦, the induced drag coefﬁcient for this wing is 0.01. Calculate the induced drag coefﬁcient for a similar wing (a rectangular wing with the same airfoil section) at the same angle of attack, but with anaspect ratio of 10. Assume that the induced factors for drag and the lift slope, δandτ, respectively, are equal to each other (i.e., δ=τ). Also, for AR =10,δ=0.105. ■Solution We must recall that although the angle of attack is the same for the two cases comparedhere (AR =6 and 10), the value of C Lis different because of the aspect-ratio effect on the lift slope. First, let us calculate CLfor the wing with aspect ratio 6. From Equation (5.61), C2 L=πARCD,i 1+δ=π(6)(0.01) 1+0.055=0.1787 Hence, CL=0.423 The lift slope of this wing is therefore dCL dα=0.423 3.4◦−(−2◦)=0.078/degree =4.485/rad The lift slope for the airfoil (the inﬁnite wing) can be obtained from Equation (5.70): dCL dα=a=a0 1+(a0/πAR)(1 +τ) 4.485 =a0 1+[(1.055) a0/π(6)]=a0 1+0.056 a0 Solving for a0, we ﬁnd that this yields a0=5.989/rad. Since the second wing (with AR=10) has the same airfoil section, then a0is the same. The lift slope of the secondCHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 459 wing is given by a=a0 1+(a0/πAR)(1 +τ)=5.989 1+[(5.989)(1.105)/π(10)]=4.95/rad =0.086/degree The lift coefﬁcient for the second wing is therefore CL=a(α−αL=0)=0.086[3.4◦−(−2◦)]=0.464 In turn, the induced drag coefﬁcient is CD,i=C2 L πAR(1+δ)=(0.464)2(1.105) π(10)=0.0076 Note: This problem would have been more straightforward if the lift coefﬁcients had been stipulated to be the same between the two wings rather than the angle of attack. Then Equation (5.61) would have yielded the induced drag coefﬁcient directly. A purpose ofthis example is to reinforce the rationale behind Equation (5.65), which readily allows thescaling of drag coefﬁcients from one aspect ratio to another, as long as the lift coefﬁcient is the same. This allows the scaled drag-coefﬁcient data to be plotted versus C L(not the angle of attack) as in Figure 5.22. However, in the present example where the angle ofattack is the same between both cases, the effect of aspect ratio on the lift slope must beexplicitly considered, as we have done above. EXAMPLE 5.3 Consider the twin-jet executive transport discussed in Example 1.6. In addition to theinformation given in Example 1.6, for this airplane the zero-lift angle of attack is −2 ◦, the lift slope of the airfoil section is 0.1 per degree, the lift efﬁciency factor τ=0.04, and the wing aspect ratio is 7.96. At the cruising condition treated in Example 1.6, calculatethe angle of attack of the airplane. ■Solution The lift slope of the airfoil section in radians is a0=0.1 per degree =0.1(57.3) =5.73 rad From Equation (5.70) repeated below a=a0 1+(a0/πAR)(1 +τ) we have a=5.73 1+/parenleftbigg5.73 7.96π/parenrightbigg (1+0.04)=4.627 per rad or a=4.627 57.3=0.0808 per degree460 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow From Example 1.6, the airplane is cruising at a lift coefﬁcient equal to 0.21. Since CL=a(α−αL=0) we have α=CL a+αL=0=0.21 0.0808+(−2)=0.6◦ EXAMPLE 5.4 In the Preview Box for this chapter, we considered the Beechcraft Baron 58 (Figure 5.1) ﬂying such that the wing is at a 4-degree angle of attack. The wing of this airplane hasan NACA 23015 airfoil at the root, tapering to a 23010 airfoil at the tip. The data forthe NACA 23015 airfoil is given in Figure 5.2. In the Preview Box, we teased you byreading from Figure 5.2 the airfoil lift and drag coefﬁcients at α=4 ◦, namely, cl=0.54 andcd=0.0068, and posed the question: Are the lift and drag coefﬁcients of the wing the same values, that is, CL=0.54 (?) and CD=0.0068 (?) The answer given in the Preview Box was a resounding NO! We now know why. Moreover, we now know how tocalculate C LandCDfor the wing. Let us proceed to do just that. Consider the wing of the Beechcraft Baron 58 at a 4-degree angle of attack. The wing has an aspect ratio of 7.61and a taper ratio of 0.45. Calculate C LandCDfor the wing. ■Solution From Figure 5.2 a, the zero-lift angle of attack of the airfoil, which is the same for the ﬁnite wing, is αL=0=−1◦ The airfoil lift slope is also obtained from Figure 5.2a . Since the lift curve is linear below the stall, we arbitrarily pick two points on this curve: α=7◦where cl=0.9, and α=−1◦ where cl=0. Thus a0=0.9−0 7−(−1)=0.9 8=0.113 per degree The lift slope in radians is: a0=0.113(57.3) =6.47 per rad From Figure 5.20, for AR =7.61 and taper ratio =0.45 δ=0.01 Hence, e=1 1+δ=1 1+0.01=0.99 From Equation (5.70), assuming τ=δ, a=a0 1+/parenleftBiga0 πAR/parenrightBig (1+τ)(aanda0are per rad)CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 461 wherea0 πAR=6.47 π(7.61)=0.271 (1+τ)=1+0.01=1.01 we have a=6.47 1+(0.271)(1.01)=5.08 per rad Converting back to degrees: a=5.08 57.3=0.0887 per degree For the linear lift curve for the ﬁnite wing CL=a(α−αL=0) Forα=4◦, we have CL=0.0887[4 −(−1)] =0.0887(5) CL=0.443 The drag coefﬁcient is given by Equation (5.63); CD=cd+C2 L πeAR Here, cdis the section drag coefﬁcient given in Figure 5.2b. Note that in Figure 5.2b, cd is plotted versus the section lift coefﬁcient cl. To accurately read cdfrom Figure 5.2b, we need to know the value of clactually sensed by the airfoil section on the ﬁnite wing, that is, the value of the airfoil clfor the airfoil at its effective angle of attack, αeff. To estimate αeff, we will assume an elliptical lift distribution over the wing. We know this is not quite correct, but with a value of δ=0.01, it is not very far off. From Equation (5.42) for an elliptical lift distribution, the induced angle of attack is αi=CL πAR=(0.443) π(7.61)=0.0185 rad In degrees αi=(0.0185)(57.3) =1.06◦ From Figure 5.6, αeff=α−αi=4◦−1.06◦=2.94◦≈3◦ The lift coefﬁcient sensed by the airfoil is then cl=a0(αeff−αL=0) =0.113[3 −(−1)] =0.113(4) =0.452 (Note how close this section lift coefﬁcient is to the overall lift coefﬁcient of the wing of 0.443.) From Figure 5.2b , taking the data at the highest Reynolds number shown, for cl=0.452, we have cd=0.0065462 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Returning to Equation (5.63), CD=cd+C2 L πeAR =0.0065 +(0.443)2 π(0.99)(7.61) =0.0065 +0.0083 =0.0148 So ﬁnally, with the results of this worked example, we see why the answer given in the Preview Box was a resounding NO! The lift coefﬁcient for the ﬁnite wing is 0.443 compared to the airfoil value of 0.54 given in the Preview Box; the ﬁnite wing value is18 percent lower than the airfoil value—a substantial difference. The drag coefﬁcient forthe ﬁnite wing is 0.0148 compared to the airfoil value of 0.0068; the ﬁnite wing value ismore than a factor of two larger—a dramatic difference. These differences are the reasonfor the studies covered in this chapter. DESIGN BOX In airplane design, the aspect ratio is a much more im- portant consideration than wing planform shape fromthe point of view of reducing the induced drag coefﬁ-cient. Although the elliptical planform, as sketched atthe top of Figure 5.18, leads to the optimum lift dis-tribution to minimize induced drag, the tapered wing,as sketched at the bottom of Figure 5.18, can yielda near-optimum lift distribution, with induced dragcoefﬁcients only a few percent higher than the ellip-tical wing. Because a tapered wing with its straightleading and trailing edges is much cheaper and easierto manufacture, the design choice for wing planformis almost always a tapered wing and hardly ever anelliptical wing. Why then did the Supermarine Spitﬁre, shown in Figure 5.19, have such a beautiful elliptical wingplanform? The answer has nothing to do with aero-dynamics. In 1935, the Supermarine Company wasresponding to the British Air Ministry speciﬁcationF.37/34 for a new ﬁghter aircraft. Designer ReginaldMitchell had originally laid out on the drawing boardan aircraft with tapered wings. However, Mitchell wasalso coping with the Air Ministry requirement that theairplane be armed with eight 0.303 caliber Brown-ing machine guns. Mounting four of these guns ineach wing far enough outboard to be outside of thepropeller disk, Mitchell had a problem—the outboardsections of the tapered wing did not have enough chordlength to accommodate the guns. His solution was anelliptical planform, which provided sufﬁcient chordlength far enough out on the span to allow the gunsto ﬁt. The result was the beautiful elliptic planformshown in Figure 5.19. The enhanced aerodynamic ef-ﬁciency of this wing was only a by-product of a prac-tical design solution. Predictably, the elliptic wingswere difﬁcult to produce, and this contributed to pro-duction delays in the critical months before the be-ginning of World War II. A second enhanced aero-dynamic by-product was afforded by the large chordlengths along most of the elliptic wing. This allowedMitchell to choose a thinner airfoil section, with 13percent thickness ratio at the wing root and 7 percentat the wing tip, and still maintain sufﬁcient absolutethickness for internal structural design. Because ofthis, the Spitﬁre had a larger critical Mach number(to be discussed in Section 11.6) and could reach theunusually high freestream Mach number of 0.92 ina dive.CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 463 For aerodynamic efﬁciency at subsonic speeds, the airplane designer would love to have very large aspect ratio wings—wings that would look like a longslat out of a common venetian blind. However, ex-isting airplanes do not ﬂy around with venetian blindslats for wings. The reason is that the structural designof such wings poses a compromise. The larger the as-pect ratio, the larger are the bending movements at thewing root caused by the lift distribution reaching far-ther away from the root. Such wings require heavierinternal structure. Hence, as the aspect ratio of a wingincreases, so does the structural weight of the wing.As a result of this compromise between aerodynamicsand structures, typical aspect ratios for conventionalsubsonic airplanes are on the order of 6 to 8. However, examine the three-view of the Lock- heed U-2 high altitude reconnaissance aircraft shownin Figure 5.26. This airplane has the unusually highaspect ratio of 14.3. Why? The answer is keyed to itsmission. The U-2 was essentially a point design; it was to cruise at the exceptionally high altitude of 70,000 ftor higher in order to not be reached by interceptor air-craft or ground-to-air-missiles during overﬂights of Figure 5.26 Three-view of the Lockheed U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance airplane.the Soviet Union in the 1950s. To achieve this mis-sion, the need for incorporating a very high aspectratio wing was paramount, for the following reason.In steady, level ﬂight, where the airplane lift Lmust equal its weight W, L=W=q ∞SCL=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞SCL (5.71) As the airplane ﬂies higher, ρ∞decreases and hence from Equation (5.71) CLmust be increased in order to keep the lift equal to the weight. As its high-altitudecruise design point, the U-2 ﬂies at a high value of C L, just on the verge of stalling. (This is in stark con- trast to the normal cruise conditions of conventionalairplanes at conventional altitudes, where the cruiselift coefﬁcient is relatively small.) At the high valueofC Lfor the U-2 at cruising altitude, its induced drag coefﬁcient [which from Equation (5.62) varies as C2 L] would be unacceptably high if a conventional aspectratio were used. Hence, the Lockheed design group (atthe Lockheed Skunk Works) had to opt for as high anaspect ratio as possible to keep the induced drag co-efﬁcient within reasonable bounds. The wing designshown in Figure 5.26 was the result.464 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow We made an observation about induced drag Di itself, in contrast to the induced drag coefﬁcient CD,i. We have emphasized, based on Equation (5.62), that CD,ican be reduced by increasing the aspect ratio. For an airplane in steady, level ﬂight, however, the induced drag force itself is governed by another de-sign parameter, rather than the aspect ratio per se, asfollows. From Equation (5.62), we have D i=q∞SCD,i=q∞SC2 L πeAR(5.72) For steady, level ﬂight, from Equation (5.71), we have C2 L=/parenleftbiggL q∞S/parenrightbigg2 =/parenleftbiggW q∞S/parenrightbigg2 (5.73) Substituting Equation (5.73) into (5.72), we have Di=q∞S/parenleftbiggW q∞S/parenrightbigg21 πeAR =1 πeq∞S/parenleftbiggW q∞S/parenrightbigg2/parenleftbiggS b2/parenrightbigg or Di=1 πeq∞/parenleftbiggW b/parenrightbigg2 (5.74) This is a rather revealing result! The induced drag insteady, level ﬂight—the force itself—does not dependexplicitly on the aspect ratio, but rather on another de-sign parameter W/bcalled the span loading: Span loading ≡W b From Equation (5.74), we see that the induced dragfor a given weight airplane can be reduced simply byincreasing the wingspan b. In so doing, the wing tip vortices (the physical source of induced drag) are sim-ply moved farther away, hence lessening their effecton the rest of the wing and in turn reducing the induceddrag. This makes good intuitive sense. However, in the preliminary design of an air- plane, the wing area Sis usually dictated by the landing or take-off speed, which is only about 10 to20 percent above V stall. This is seen by Equation (1.47)repeated below Vstall=/radicalBigg 2W ρ∞SCL,max(1.47) For a speciﬁed Vstallat sea level, and given CL,maxfor the airplane, Equation (1.47) determines the necessarywing area for a given weight airplane. Therefore, re-ﬂecting on Equation (5.74) when we say that D ican be reduced for a given weight airplane simply by increas-ing the wing span, since Sis usually ﬁxed for the given weight, then clearly the aspect ratio b 2/Sincreases as we increase b. So when we use Equation (5.74) to say that Dican be reduced by increasing the span for a given weight airplane, this also has the connotationof increasing the aspect ratio. However, it is instruc-tional to note that D idepends explicitly on the design parameter, W/b, and not the aspect ratio; this is the message in Equation (5.74). Question: How much of the total drag of an air- plane is induced drag? A generic answer to this ques-tion is shown in the bar chart in Figure 5.27. Here,the induced drag (shaded portion) relative to parasitedrag (white portion) is shown for typical cruise andtakeoff conditions for a generic subsonic jet transport.The parasite drag is the sum of the drag due to skinfriction and pressure drag due to ﬂow separation asso-ciated with the complete airplane, including the wing.

Figure 5.27 indicates thatinduced drag is about 25 percent of the total drag atcruise, but can be 60 percent or more of the total dragat takeoff (where the airplane is ﬂying at high C L).For more details on the drag characteristics of airplanes, and their associated impact on airplane de-sign, see the author’s book Aircraft Performance and Design, McGraw-Hill, Boston, 1999. 5.4 A NUMERICAL NONLINEAR LIFTING-LINE METHOD The classical Prandtl lifting-line theory described in Section 5.3 assumes a linear variation of clversus αeff. This is clearly seen in Equation (5.19). However, as the angle of attack approaches and exceeds the stall angle, the lift curve becomesnonlinear, as shown in Figure 4.9. This high-angle-of-attack regime is of interestto modern aerodynamicists. For example, when an airplane is in a spin, the angleof attack can range from 40 to 90 ◦; an understanding of high-angle-of-attack aero- dynamics is essential to the prevention of such spins. In addition, modern ﬁghterairplanes achieve optimum maneuverability by pulling high angles of attack atsubsonic speeds. Therefore, there are practical reasons for extending Prandtl’sclassical theory to account for a nonlinear lift curve. One simple extension isdescribed in this section. The classical theory developed in Section 5.4 is essentially closed form; that is, the results are analytical equations as opposed to a purely numerical solution.Of course, in the end, the Fourier coefﬁcients A nfor a given wing must come from a solution of a system of simultaneous linear algebraic equations. Until the adventof the modern digital computer, these coefﬁcients were calculated by hand. Today,they are readily solved on a computer using standard matrix methods. However,the elements of the lifting-line theory lend themselves to a straightforward purelynumerical solution which allows the treatment of nonlinear effects. Moreover,this numerical solution emphasizes the fundamental aspects of lifting-line theory.For these reasons, such a numerical solution is outlined in this section. Consider the most general case of a ﬁnite wing of given planform and geo- metric twist, with different airfoil sections at different spanwise stations. Assumethat we have experimental data for the lift curves of the airfoil sections, includ-ing the nonlinear regime (i.e., assume we have the conditions of Figure 4.9 forall the given airfoil sections). A numerical iterative solution for the ﬁnite-wingproperties can be obtained as follows: 1.Divide the wing into a number of spanwise stations, as shown in Figure 5.28. Here k+1 stations are shown, with ndesignating any speciﬁc station. 2.For the given wing at a given α,assume the lift distribution along the span; that is, assume values for /Gamma1at all the stations /Gamma1 1,/Gamma12,...,/Gamma1 n,...,/Gamma1 k+1. An elliptical lift distribution is satisfactory for such an assumed distribution.466 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 5.28 Stations along the span for a numerical solution. 3.With this assumed variation of /Gamma1, calculate the induced angle of attack αi from Equation (5.18) at each of the stations: αi(yn)=1 4πV∞/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2(d/Gamma1/dy)dy yn−y(5.75) The integral is evaluated numerically. If Simpson’s rule is used, Equation (5.75) becomes αi(yn)=1 4πV∞/Delta1y 3k/summationdisplay j=2,4,6(d/Gamma1/dy)j−1 (yn−yj−1)+4(d/Gamma1/dy)j yn−yj+(d/Gamma1/dy)j+1 yn−yj+1(5.76) where /Delta1yis the distance between stations. In Equation (5.76), when yn=yj−1,yj, oryj+1, a singularity occurs (a denominator goes to zero). When this singularity occurs, it can be avoided by replacing the given termby its average value based on the two adjacent sections. 4.Using α ifrom step 3, obtain the effective angle of attack αeffat each station from αeff(yn)=α−αi(yn) 5.With the distribution of αeffcalculated from step 4, obtain the section lift coefﬁcient (cl)nat each station. These values are read from the known lift curve for the airfoil. 6.From(cl)nobtained in step 5, a newcirculation distribution is calculated from the Kutta-Joukowski theorem and the deﬁnition of lift coefﬁcient: L/prime(yn)=ρ∞V∞/Gamma1(yn)=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞cn(cl)n Hence, /Gamma1(yn)=1 2V∞cn(cl)n where cnis the local section chord. Keep in mind that in all the above steps, nranges from 1 to k+1. 7.The new distribution of /Gamma1obtained in step 6 is compared with the values that were initially fed into step 3. If the results from step 6 do not agree withthe input to step 3, then a new input is generated. If the previous input tostep 3 is designated as /Gamma1 oldand the result of step 6 is designated as /Gamma1new,CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 467 Figure 5.29 Lift distribution for a rectangular wing; comparison between Prandtl’s classical theory and the numerical lifting-line method of Reference 20. then the new input to step 3 is determined from /Gamma1input=/Gamma1old+D(/Gamma1new−/Gamma1old) where Dis a damping factor for the iterations. Experience has found that the iterative procedure requires heavy damping, with typical values of Don the order of 0.05. 8.Steps 3 to 7 are repeated a sufﬁcient number of cycles until /Gamma1newand/Gamma1old agree at each spanwise station to within acceptable accuracy. If this accuracy is stipulated to be within 0.01 percent for a stretch of ﬁve previousiterations, then a minimum of 50 and sometimes as many as 150 iterationsmay be required for convergence. 9.From the converged /Gamma1(y), the lift and induced drag coefﬁcients are obtained from Equations (5.26) and (5.30), respectively. The integrations in theseequations can again be carried out by Simpson’s rule. The procedure outlined above generally works smoothly and quickly on a high-speed digital computer. Typical results are shown in Figure 5.29, which shows the circulation distributions for rectangular wings with three differentaspect ratios. The solid lines are from the classical calculations of Prandtl(Section 5.3), and the symbols are from the numerical method described above.Excellent agreement is obtained, thus verifying the integrity and accuracy of thenumerical method. Also, Figure 5.29 should be studied as an example of typicalcirculation distributions over general ﬁnite wings, with /Gamma1reasonably high over the center section of the wing but rapidly dropping to zero at the tips.468 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 5.30 Lift coefﬁcient versus angle of attack; comparison between experimental and numerical results. Figure 5.31 Surface oil ﬂow pattern on a stalled, ﬁnite rectangular wing with a Clark Y-14 airfoil section. AR =3.5,α=22.8◦, Re=245,000 (based on chord length). This pattern was established by coating the wing surface with pigmented mineral oil and inserting the model in a low-speed subsonic wind tunnel. In the photograph shown, ﬂow is from top tobottom. Note the highly three-dimensional ﬂow pattern. (© Allen E. Winkelmann/Universityof Maryland ). An example of the use of the numerical method for the nonlinear regime is shown in Figure 5.30. Here, CLversus αis given for a rectangular wing up to an angle of attack of 50◦—well beyond stall. The numerical results are compared with existing experimental data obtained at the University of Mary- land (Reference 19). The numerical lifting-line solution at high angle of attackagrees with the experiment to within 20 percent, and much closer for many cases.Therefore, such solutions give reasonable preliminary engineering results for thehigh-angle-of-attack poststall region. However, it is wise not to stretch the appli-cability of lifting-line theory too far. At high angles of attack, the ﬂow is highlythree-dimensional. This is clearly seen in the surface oil pattern on a rectangularwing at high angle of attack shown in Figure 5.31. At high α, there is a strongCHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 469 spanwise ﬂow, in combination with mushroom-shaped ﬂow separation regions. Clearly, the basic assumptions of lifting-line theory, classical or numerical, cannotproperly account for such three-dimensional ﬂows. For more details and results on the numerical lifting-line method, please see Reference 20. 5.5 THE LIFTING-SURFACE THEORY AND THE VORTEX LATTICE NUMERICAL METHOD Prandtl’s classical lifting-line theory (Section 5.3) gives reasonable results forstraight wings at moderate to high aspect ratio. However, for low-aspect-ratiostraight wings, swept wings, and delta wings, classical lifting-line theory is in-appropriate. For such planforms, sketched in Figure 5.32, a more sophisticatedmodel must be used. The purpose of this section is to introduce such a modeland to discuss its numerical implementation. However, it is beyond the scope ofthis book to elaborate on the details of such higher-order models; rather, onlythe ﬂavor is given here. You are encouraged to pursue this subject by reading theliterature and by taking more advanced studies in aerodynamics. Return to Figure 5.15. Here, a simple lifting line spans the wing, with its associated trailing vortices. The circulation /Gamma1varies with yalong the lifting line. Let us extend this model by placing a series of lifting lines on the plane of the wing, at different chordwise stations; that is, consider a large number of lifting lines allparallel to the yaxis, located at different values of x, as shown in Figure 5.33. In the limit of an inﬁnite number of lines of inﬁnitesimal strength, we obtain avortex sheet, where the vortex lines run parallel to the yaxis. The strength of this sheet (per unit length in the xdirection) is denoted by γ, where γvaries in the y direction, analogous to the variation of /Gamma1for the single lifting line in Figure 5.15. Moreover, each lifting line will have, in general, a different overall strength, sothatγvaries with xalso. Hence, γ=γ(x,y)as shown in Figure 5.33. In addition, recall that each lifting line has a system of trailing vortices; hence, the series oflifting lines is crossed by a series of superimposed trailing vortices parallel to the xaxis. In the limit of an inﬁnite number of inﬁnitesimally weak vortices, these trailing vortices form another vortex sheet of strength δ(per unit length in the Figure 5.32 Types of wing planforms for which classical lifting-line theory is not appropriate.470 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 5.33 Schematic of a lifting surface. ydirection). [Note that this δis different from the δused in Equation (5.61); the use of the same symbol in both cases is standard, and there should be no confusion since the meanings and context are completely different.] To see thismore clearly, consider a single line parallel to the xaxis. As we move along this line from the leading edge to the trailing edge, we pick up an additionalsuperimposed trailing vortex each time we cross a lifting line. Hence, δmust vary with x. Moreover, the trailing vortices are simply parts of the horseshoe vortex systems, the leading edges of which make up the various lifting lines.Since the circulation about each lifting line varies in the ydirection, the strengths of different trailing vortices will, in general, be different. Hence, δalso varies in the ydirection, that is, δ=δ(x,y), as shown in Figure 5.33. The two vortex sheets—the one with vortex lines running parallel to ywith strength γ(per unit length in the xdirection) and the other with vortex lines running parallel to xwith strength δ(per unit length in the ydirection)—result in a lifting surface distributed over the entire planform of the wing, as shown in Figure 5.33. At any given pointon the surface, the strength of the lifting surface is given by both γandδ, which are functions of xandy. We denote γ=γ(x,y)as the spanwise vortex strength distribution and δ=δ(x,y)as the chordwise vortex strength distribution. Note that downstream of the trailing edge we have no spanwise vortex lines, only trailing vortices. Hence, the wake consists of only chordwise vortices. Thestrength of this wake vortex sheet is given by δ w(per unit length in the ydirection). Since in the wake the trailing vortices do not cross any vortex lines, the strengthCHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 471 Figure 5.34 Velocity induced at point Pby an inﬁnitesimal segment of the lifting surface. The velocity is perpendicular to the plane of the paper. of any given trailing vortex is constant with x. Hence, δwdepends only on yand, throughout the wake, δw(y)is equal to its value at the trailing edge. Now that we have deﬁned the lifting surface, of what use is it? Consider point Plocated at (x,y)on the wing, as shown in Figure 5.33. The lifting surface and the wake vortex sheet both induce a normal component of velocity at point P. Denote this normal velocity by w(x,y). We want the wing planform to be a stream surface of the ﬂow; that is, we want the sum of the induced w(x,y)and the normal component of the freestream velocity to be zero at point Pand for all points on the wing—this is the ﬂow-tangency condition on the wing surface. (Keep in mind that we are treating the wing as a ﬂat surface in this discussion.)The central theme of lifting-surface theory is to ﬁnd γ(x,y)andδ(x,y)such that the ﬂow-tangency condition is satisﬁed at all points on the wing. [Recall that inthe wake, δ w(y)is ﬁxed by the trailing-edge values of δ(x,y); hence, δw(y)is not, strictly speaking, one of the unknown dependent variables.] Let us obtain an expression for the induced normal velocity w(x,y)in terms ofγ,δ, andδw. Consider the sketch given in Figure 5.34, which shows a portion of the planview of a ﬁnite wing. Consider the point given by the coordinates (ξ, η). At this point, the spanwise vortex strength is γ(ξ, η). Consider a thin ribbon, or472 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow ﬁlament, of the spanwise vortex sheet of incremental length dξin the xdirection. Hence, the strength of this ﬁlament is γdξ, and the ﬁlament stretches in the y (orη) direction. Also, consider point Plocated at (x,y)and removed a distance rfrom the point (ξ, η). From the Biot-Savart law, Equation (5.5), the incremental velocity induced at Pby a segment dηof this vortex ﬁlament of strength γdξis |dV|=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/Gamma1 4πdl×r |r|3/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle =γdξ 4π(dη)rsinθ r3(5.77) Examining Figure 5.34, and following the right-hand rule for the strength γ, note that|dV| is induced downward, into the plane of the wing (i.e., in the negative zdirection). Following the usual sign convention that wis positive in the up- ward direction (i.e., in the positive zdirection), we denote the contribution of Equation (5.77) to the induced velocity was(dw)γ= −|dV|. Also, note that sinθ=(x−ξ)/r. Hence, Equation (5.77) becomes (dw)γ=−γ 4π(x−ξ)dξdη r3(5.78) Considering the contribution of the elemental chordwise vortex of strength δdη to the induced velocity at P, we ﬁnd by an analogous argument that (dw)δ=−δ 4π(y−η)dξdη r3(5.79) To obtain the velocity induced at Pby the entire lifting surface, Equations (5.78) and (5.79) must be integrated over the wing planform, designated as region S in Figure 5.34. Moreover, the velocity induced at Pby the complete wake is given by an equation analogous to Equation (5.79), but with δwinstead of δ, and integrated over the wake, designated as region Win Figure 5.34. Noting that r=/radicalbig (x−ξ)2+(y−η)2 the normal velocity induced at Pby both the lifting surface and the wake is w(x,y)=−1 4π/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(x−ξ)γ(ξ, η) +(y−η)δ(ξ, η) [(x−ξ)2+(y−η)2]3/2dξdη −1 4π/integraldisplay/integraldisplay W(y−η)δw(η) [(x−ξ)2+(y−η)2]3/2dξdη(5.80) The central problem of lifting-surface theory is to solve Equation (5.80) for γ(ξ, η) andδ(ξ, η) such that the sum of w(x,y)and the normal component of the freestream is zero, that is, such that the ﬂow is tangent to the planform sur-face S. The details of various lifting-surface solutions are beyond the scope of this book; rather, our purpose here was simply to present the ﬂavor of the basic model. The advent of the high-speed digital computer has made possible the im- plementation of numerical solutions based on the lifting-surface concept. Thesesolutions are similar to the panel solutions for two-dimensional ﬂow discussed inChapters 3 and 4 in that the wing planform is divided into a number of panels, orCHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 473 Figure 5.35 Schematic of a single horseshoe vortex, which is part of a vortex system on the wing. Figure 5.36 V ortex lattice system on a ﬁnite wing. elements. On each panel, either constant or prescribed variations of both γandδ can be made. Control points on the panels can be chosen, where the net normal ﬂow velocity is zero. The evaluation of equations like Equation (5.80) at thesecontrol points results in a system of simultaneous algebraic equations that can besolved for the values of the γ’s and δ’s on all the panels. A related but somewhat simpler approach is to superimpose a ﬁnite number of horseshoe vortices of different strengths /Gamma1 non the wing surface. For example, consider Figure 5.35, which shows part of a ﬁnite wing. The dashed lines deﬁne apanel on the wing planform, where lis the length of the panel in the ﬂow direction. The panel is a trapezoid; it does not have to be a square, or even a rectangle. Ahorseshoe vortex abcd of strength /Gamma1 nis placed on the panel such that the segment bcis a distance l/4 from the front of the panel. A control point is placed on the centerline of the panel at a distance3 4lfrom the front. The velocity induced at an arbitrary point Ponly by the single horseshoe vortex can be calculated from the Biot-Savart law by treating each of the vortex ﬁlaments ab,bc, and cdseparately. Now consider the entire wing covered by a ﬁnite number of panels, as sketchedin Figure 5.36. A series of horseshoe vortices is now superimposed. For example,Anderson-3930659 book August 29, 2016 10:42 474 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow on one panel at the leading edge, we have the horseshoe vortex abcd. On the panel behind it, we have the horseshoe vortex aefd. On the next panel, we have aghd, and on the next, aijd, etc. The entire wing is covered by this lattice of horseshoe vortices, each of different unknown strength /Gamma1n. At any control point P, the normal velocity induced by allthe horseshoe vortices can be obtained from the Biot-Savart law. When the ﬂow-tangency condition is applied at all the control points, a system of simultaneous algebraic equations results which canbe solved for the unknown /Gamma1 n’s. This numerical approach is called the vortex lattice method and is in wide use today for the analysis of ﬁnite-wing properties. Once again, only the ﬂavor of the method is given above; you are encouragedto read the volumes of literature that now exist on various versions of the vortexlattice method. In particular, Reference 13 has an excellent introductory discussionon the vortex lattice method, including a worked example that clearly illustratesthe salient points of the technique. DESIGN BOX The lift slope for a high-aspect-ratio straight wing with an elliptical lift distribution is predicted by Prandtl’slifting-line theory and is given by Equation (5.69),repeated below: a=a0 1+a0/πAR high-aspect-ratio straight wings (5.69) This relation, and others like it, is useful for the con-ceptual design process, where simple formulas, albeitapproximate, can lead to fast, back-of-the-envelopecalculations. However, Equation (5.69), like all re-sults from simple lifting-line theory, is valid only forhigh-aspect-ratio straight wings (AR >4, as a rule of thumb). The German aerodynamicist H. B. Helmbold in 1942 modiﬁed Equation (5.69) to obtain the followingform applicable to low-aspect-ratio straight wings: a=a0/radicalbig 1+(a0/πAR)2+a0/(πAR) low-aspect-ratio straight wing (5.81) Equation (5.81) is remarkably accurate for wings withAR<4. This is demonstrated in Figure 5.37, whichgives experimental data for the lift slope for rectan-gular wings as a function of AR from 0.5 to 6; thesedata are compared with the predictions from Prandtl’slifting-line theory, Equation (5.69), and Helmbold’sequation, Equation (5.81). Note from Figure 5.37 thatHelmbold’s equation gives excellent agreement withthe data for AR <4. For swept wings, Kuchemann (Reference 66) suggests the following modiﬁcation to Helmbold’sequation: a=a0cos/Lambda1/radicalbig 1+[(a0cos/Lambda1)/(π AR)]2+[a0cos/Lambda1/(π AR)] swept wing (5.82) where /Lambda1is the sweep angle of the wing, referenced to the half-chord line, as shown in Figure 5.38. Keep in mind that Equations (5.69), (5.81), and (5.82) apply to incompressible ﬂow. Compressibility corrections to account for high Mach number effectswill be discussed in Chapter 10. Also, the equations above are simple formulas intended to provide quick and easy “back of the en-velope” calculations for conceptual design purposes.In contrast, today the power of computational ﬂuidCHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 475 112345 23 Aspect ratioExperiment Prandtl & Betz (1920) and othersPrandtl Eq.

More-over, the combination of CFD with modern opti-mization procedures allows the optimized design ofthe complete wing, including not only the optimumplanform shape, but also the optimum variation of air-foil shape along the span. Because this modern, op-timized wing design is usually applied to high-speedairplanes where the ﬂow must be treated as compress-ible, we defer any discussion of this modern designprocess until Part 3 of this book.476 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 5.6 APPLIED AERODYNAMICS: THE DELTA WING In Part 3 of this book, we will see that supersonic ﬂow is dramatically different from subsonic ﬂow in virtually all respects—the mathematics and physics ofthese two ﬂow regimes are totally different. Such differences impact the designphilosophy of aircraft for supersonic ﬂight in comparison to aircraft for subsonicﬂight. In particular, supersonic airplanes usually have highly swept wings (thereasons for this are discussed in Part 3). A special case of swept wings is thoseaircraft with a triangular planform—called delta wings. A comparison of theplanform of a conventional swept wing was shown in Figure 5.32. Two classicexamples of aircraft with delta wings are the Convair F-102A, the ﬁrst operationaljet airplane in the United States to be designed with a delta wing, shown inFigure 5.39 a, and the space shuttle, basically a hypersonic airplane, shown in Figure 5.39b . In reality, the planform of the space shuttle is more correctly denoted as a double-delta shape. Indeed, there are several variants of the basic delta wingused on modern aircraft; these are shown in Figure 5.40. Delta wings are used onmany different types of high-speed airplanes around the world; hence, the deltaplanform is an important aerodynamic conﬁguration. Question: Since delta-winged aircraft are high-speed vehicles, why are we discussing this topic in the present chapter, which deals with the low-speed, in-compressible ﬂow over ﬁnite wings? The obvious answer is that all high-speedaircraft ﬂy at low speeds for takeoff and landing; moreover, in most cases, theseaircraft spend the vast majority of their ﬂight time at subsonic speeds, usingtheir supersonic capability for short “supersonic dashes,” depending on theirmission. Several exceptions are, of course, the Concorde supersonic transportwhich cruised at supersonic speeds across oceans, and the space shuttle, whichis hypersonic for most of its reentry into the earth’s atmosphere. However, a vastmajority of delta-winged aircraft spend a great deal of their ﬂight time at subsonicspeeds. For this reason, the low-speed aerodynamic characteristics of delta wingsare of great importance; this is accentuated by the rather different and uniqueaerodynamic aspects associated with such delta wings. Therefore, the low-speedaerodynamics of delta wings has been a subject of much serious study over thepast years, going back as far as the early work on delta wings by AlexanderLippisch in Germany during the 1930s. This is the answer to our question posedabove—in the context of our discussion on ﬁnite wings, we must give the deltawing some special attention. The subsonic ﬂow pattern over the top of a delta wing at angle of attack is sketched in Figure 5.41. The dominant aspect of this ﬂow are the two vortexpatterns that occur in the vicinity of the highly swept leading edges. These vortexpatterns are created by the following mechanism. The pressure on the bottomsurface of the wing at the angle of attack is higher than the pressure on the topsurface. Thus, the ﬂow on the bottom surface in the vicinity of the leading edgetries to curl around the leading edge from the bottom to the top. If the leadingedge is sharp, the ﬂow will separate along its entire length. (We have alreadymentioned several times that when low-speed, subsonic ﬂow passes over a sharpCHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 477 (a) Figure 5.39 Some delta-winged vehicles.

(NASA). convex corner, inviscid ﬂow theory predicts an inﬁnite velocity at the corner, and that nature copes with this situation by having the ﬂow separate at the corner.The leading edge of a delta wing is such a case.) This separated ﬂow curls into aprimary vortex which exists above the wing just inboard of each leading edge, as478 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow (b) Figure 5.39 (continued) Some delta-winged vehicles.

The stream surface which has separated at the leading edge (the primary separation line S1in Figure 5.41) loops above the wing and then reattaches along the primary attachment line (line A1in Figure 5.41). The primary vortex is contained within this loop. A secondary vortex is formed underneath theprimary vortex, with its own separation line, denoted by S 2in Figure 5.41, and its own reattachment line A2. Notice that the surface streamlines ﬂow away from the attachment lines A1andA2on both sides of these lines, whereas the surface streamlines tend to ﬂow toward the separation lines S1andS2and then simply lift off the surface along these lines. Inboard of the leading-edge vortices, the surfacestreamlines are attached, and ﬂow downstream virtually is undisturbed along aseries of straight-line rays emanating from the vertex of the triangular shape. Agraphic illustration of the leading-edge vortices is shown in both Figures 5.42 and5.43. In Figure 5.42, we see a highly swept delta wing mounted in a water tunnel.Filaments of colored dye are introduced at two locations along each leadingedge. This photograph, taken from an angle looking down on the top of the wing,clearly shows the entrainment of the colored dye in the vortices. Figure 5.43 isa photograph of the vortex pattern in the crossﬂow plane (the crossﬂow plane isshown in Figure 5.41). From the photographs in Figures 5.42 and 5.43, we clearlysee that the leading-edge vortex is real and is positioned above and somewhatinboard of the leading edge itself. The leading-edge vortices are strong and stable. Being a source of high energy, relatively high-vorticity ﬂow, the local static pressure in the vicinity of the vorticesis small. Hence, the surface pressure on the top surface of the delta wing is reducedCHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 481 Figure 5.43 The ﬂow ﬁeld in the crossﬂow plane above a delta wing at angle of attack, showing the two primary leading-edge vortices.

The qualitative variation of the pressure coefﬁcient in the spanwisedirection (the ydirection as shown in Figure 5.41) is sketched in Figure 5.44. The spanwise variation of pressure over the bottom surface is essentially constantand higher than the freestream pressure (a positive C p). Over the top surface,482 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 5.45 Variation of lift coefﬁcient for a ﬂat delta wing with angle of attack. (Data Courtesy of John Stollery, Cranﬁeld Institute of Technology, England ). the spanwise variation in the midsection of the wing is essentially constant and lower than the freestream pressure (a negative Cp). However, near the leading edges the static pressure drops considerably (the values of Cpbecome more negative). The leading-edge vortices are literally creating a strong “suction” on thetop surface near the leading edges. In Figure 5.44, vertical arrows are shown toindicate further the effect on the spanwise lift distribution; the upward directionof these arrows as well as their relative length show the local contribution of eachsection of the wing to the normal force distribution. The suction effect of theleading-edge vortices is clearly shown by these arrows. The suction effect of the leading-edge vortices enhances the lift; for this reason, the lift coefﬁcient curve for a delta wing exhibits an increase in C Lfor values of αat which conventional wing planforms would be stalled. A typical variation of CLwithαfor a 60◦delta wing is shown in Figure 5.45. Note the following characteristics: 1.The lift slope is small, on the order of 0.05/degree. 2.However, the lift continues to increase to large values of α; in Figure 5.45, the stalling angle of attack is on the order of 35◦. The net result is a reasonable value of CL,max, on the order of 1.3.CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 483 Figure 5.46 The effect of leading-edge shape on the lift-to-drag ratio for a delta wing of aspect ratio 2.31. The two solid curves apply to a sharp leading edge, and the dashed curve applies to arounded leading edge. LEVF denotes a wing with a leading-edgevortex ﬂap. (Data Courtesy of John Stollery, Cranﬁeld Institute ofTechnology, England ). The next time you have an opportunity to watch a delta-winged airplane take off or land, say, for example, the televised landing of the space shuttle, note thelarge angle of attack of the vehicle. Moreover, you will understand why the angleof attack is large—because the lift slope is small, and hence the angle of attackmust be large enough to generate the high values of C Lrequired for low-speed ﬂight. The suction effect of the leading-edge vortices, in acting to increase the nor- mal force, consequently, increases the drag at the same time it increases the lift.Hence, the aerodynamic effect of these vortices is not necessarily advantageous.In fact, the lift-to-drag ratio L/Dfor a delta planform is not so high as conven- tional wings. The typical variation of L/Dwith C Lfor a delta wing is shown in Figure 5.46, the results for the sharp leading edge, 60◦delta wing are given by the lower curve. Note that the maximum value of L/Dfor this case is about 9.3—not a particularly exciting value for a low-speed aircraft.484 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow There are two other phenomena that are reﬂected by the data in Figure 5.46. The ﬁrst is the effect of greatly rounding the leading edges of the delta wing. In our previous discussions, we have treated the case of a sharp leading edge;such sharp edges cause the ﬂow to separate at the leading edge, forming theleading-edge vortices. On the other hand, if the leading-edge radius is large,the ﬂow separation will be minimized, or possibly will not occur. In turn, thedrag penalty discussed above will not be present, and hence the L/Dratio will increase. The dashed curve in Figure 5.46 is the case for a 60 ◦delta wing with well- rounded leading edges. Note that (L/D)maxfor this case is about 16.5, almost a factor of 2 higher than the sharp leading-edge case. However, keep in mindthat these are results for subsonic speeds. There is a major design compromisereﬂected in these results. At the beginning of this section, we mentioned thatthe delta-wing planform with sharp leading edges is advantageous for supersonicﬂight—its highly swept shape in combination with sharp leading edges has a lowsupersonic drag. However, at supersonic speeds this advantage will be negatedif the leading edges are rounded to any great extent. We will ﬁnd in our studyof supersonic ﬂow in Part 3 that a blunt-nosed body creates very large valuesof wave drag. Therefore, leading edges with large radii are not appropriate forsupersonic aircraft; indeed, it is desirable to have as sharp a leading edge as ispractically possible for supersonic airplanes. A singular exception is the design ofthe space shuttle. The leading-edge radius of the space shuttle is large; this is dueto three features that combine to make such blunt leading edges advantageousfor the shuttle. First, the shuttle must slow down early during reentry into theearth’s atmosphere to avoid massive aerodynamic heating (aspects of aerodynamicheating are discussed in Part 4). Therefore, in order to obtain this deceleration,a high drag is desirable for the space shuttle; indeed, the maximum L/Dratio of the space shuttle during reentry is about 2. A large leading-edge radius, withits attendant high drag, is therefore advantageous. Second, as we will see inPart 4, the rate of aerodynamic heating to the leading edge itself—a region ofhigh heating—is inversely proportional to the square root of the leading-edgeradius. Hence, the larger the radius, the smaller will be the heating rate to theleading edge. Third, as already explained above, a highly rounded leading edgeis certainly advantageous to the shuttle’s subsonic aerodynamic characteristics.Hence, a well-rounded leading edge is an important design feature for the spaceshuttle on all accounts. However, we must be reminded that this is not the case formore conventional supersonic aircraft, which demand very sharp leading edges.For these aircraft, a delta wing with a sharp leading edge has relatively poorsubsonic performance. This leads to the second of the phenomena reﬂected in Figure 5.46. The middle curve in Figure 5.46 is labeled LEVF, which denotes the case for a leading-edgevortex ﬂap. This pertains to a mechanical conﬁguration where the leading edgescan be deﬂected downward through a variable angle, analogous to the deﬂection ofa conventional trailing-edge ﬂap. The spanwise pressure-coefﬁcient distributionfor this case is sketched in Figure 5.47; note that the direction of the suction dueCHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 485 Figure 5.47 A schematic of the spanwise pressure coefﬁcient distribution over the top of a delta wing as modiﬁed by leading-edge vortex ﬂaps. (Data Courtesy of John Stollery, Cranﬁeld Institute ofTechnology, England ). to the leading-edge vortice is now modiﬁed in comparison to the case with no leading-edge ﬂap shown earlier in Figure 5.44. Also, returning to Figure 5.41,you can visualize what the wing geometry would look like with the leading edgedrooped down; a front view of the downward deﬂected ﬂap would actually showsome projected frontal area. Since the pressure is low over this frontal area, thenet drag can decrease. This phenomenon is illustrated by the middle curve inFigure 5.46, which shows a generally higher L/Dfor the leading-edge vortex ﬂap in comparison to the case with no ﬂap (the ﬂat delta wing). Finally, we note something drastic that occurs in the ﬂow over the top surface of a delta wing when it is at a high enough angle of attack. The primary vorticesshown in Figures 5.41 and 5.42 begin to fall apart somewhere along the lengthof the vortex; this is called vortex breakdown, illustrated in Figure 5.48. Com- pare this photograph with that shown in Figure 5.42 for well-behaved vortices atlower angle of attack. In Figure 5.48 the two leading-edge vortices show vortexbreakdown at a location about two-thirds along their length over the top of thewing. This photograph is particularly interesting because it shows two types ofvortex breakdown. The vortex at the top of the photograph exhibits a spiral-typeof vortex breakdown, where the breakdown occurs progressively along the coreand causes the core to twist in various directions. The vortex at the bottom ofthe photograph exhibits a bubble-type of vortex breakdown, where the vortexsuddenly bursts, forming a large bubble of chaotic ﬂow. The spiral type of vortexbreakdown is more common. When vortex breakdown occurs, the lift and pitch-ing moment of the delta wing decrease, the ﬂow becomes unsteady, and buffetingof the wing occurs.486 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 5.48 V ortex breakdown over a delta wing. (© Science Source). The progressive development of vortex breakdown is shown by the com- putational ﬂuid dynamic (CFD) results in Figure 5.49 for a delta wing with a 60-degree sweep angle. At α=5◦(Figure 5.49 a), the vortex core is well- behaved. At α=15◦(Figure 5.49b ), vortex breakdown is starting. At α=40◦ (Figure 5.49c ), the ﬂow over the top of the delta wing is completely separated, and the wing is stalled. The results in Figure 5.49 are interesting for another rea-son as well. In a footnote to Section 4.4 we noted that inviscid ﬂow calculationssometimes predict the location and nature of ﬂow separation. Here we see anothersuch case. The vortex breakdown and separated ﬂow shown in Figure 5.49 arecalculated from a CFD solution of the Euler equations (i.e., an inviscid ﬂow cal-culation). It appears that friction does not play a critical role in vortex formationand breakdown. (For more information on vortex bursting over delta wings, see the recent survey by I. Gursul, “Recent Developments in Delta Wing Aerodynamics,” The Aeronautical Journal, vol. 108, number 1087, September 2004, pp. 437–452.) In summary, the delta wing is a common planform for supersonic aircraft. In this section, we have examined the low-speed aerodynamic characteristics of suchwings and have found that these characteristics are in some ways quite differentfrom a conventional planform.CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 487 V ortex Core V ortex Breakdown Wing Stall(a) (b) (c) Figure 5.49 V ortex behavior and breakdown progression with increasing angles of attack of ( a)5◦,(b) 15◦,(c) 40◦.(Source: R.

Visbal, “Computation of the Aeroelastic Response of a Flexible Delta Wing at HighAngles-of-Attack,” AIAA Paper 2003-1728, 2003).488 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 5.7 HISTORICAL NOTE: LANCHESTER AND PRANDTL—THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF FINITE-WING THEORY On June 27, 1866, in a paper entitled “Aerial Locomotion” given to the Aero- nautical Society of Great Britain, the Englishman Francis Wenham expressed forthe ﬁrst time in history the effect of aspect ratio on ﬁnite-wing aerodynamics.He theorized (correctly) that most of the lift of a wing occurs from the portionnear the leading edge, and hence a long, narrow wing would be most efﬁcient.He suggested stacking a number of long thin wings above each other to generatethe required lift, and he built two full-size gliders in 1858, both with ﬁve wingseach, to demonstrate (successfully) his ideas. (Wenham is also known for de-signing and building the ﬁrst wind tunnel in history, at Greenwich, England, in1871.) However, the true understanding of ﬁnite-wing aerodynamics, as well as ideas for the theoretical analysis of ﬁnite wings, did not come until 1907. In that year,Frederick W. Lanchester published his now famous book entitled Aerodynamics. We have met Lanchester before—in Section 4.15 concerning his role in the de-velopment of the circulation theory of lift. Here, we examine his contributions toﬁnite-wing theory. In Lanchester’s Aerodynamics, we ﬁnd the ﬁrst mention of vortices that trail downstream of the wing tips. Figure 5.50 is one of Lanchester’s own drawingsfrom his 1907 book, showing the “vortex trunk” which forms at the wing tip.Moreover, he knew that a vortex ﬁlament could not end in space (see Section 5.2),and he theorized that the vortex ﬁlaments that constituted the two wing-tip vorticesmust cross the wing along its span—the ﬁrst concept of bound vortices in thespanwise direction. Hence, the essence of the horseshoe vortex concept originatedwith Lanchester. In his own words: Thus the author regards the two trailed vortices as a deﬁnite proof of the existence of a cyclic component of equal strength in the motion surrounding the airfoil itself. Figure 5.50 A ﬁgure from Lanchester’s Aerodynamics, 1907; this is his own drawing of the wing-tip vortex on a ﬁnite wing.CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 489 Considering the foresight and originality of Lanchester’s thinking, let us pause for a moment and look at the man himself. Lanchester was born on Octo- ber 23, 1868, in Lewisham, England. The son of an architect, Lanchester becameinterested in engineering at an early age. (He was told by his family that his mindwas made up at the age of 4.) He studied engineering and mining during the years1886–1889 at the Royal College of Science in South Kensington, London, butnever ofﬁcially graduated. He was a quick-minded and innovative thinker andbecame a designer at the Forward Gas Engine Company in 1889, specializingin internal combustion engines. He rose to the post of assistant works manager.In the early 1890s, Lanchester became very interested in aeronautics, and alongwith his development of high-speed engines, he also carried out numerous aero-dynamics experiments. It was during this period that he formulated his ideas onboth the circulation theory of lift and the ﬁnite-wing vortex concepts. A seriouspaper written by Lanchester ﬁrst for the Royal Society, and then for the PhysicalSociety, was turned down for publication—something Lanchester never forgot.Finally, his aeronautical concepts were published in his two books Aerodynamics andAerodonetics in 1907 and 1908, respectively. To his detriment, Lanchester had a style of writing and a means of explanation that were not easy to follow andhis works were not immediately seized upon by other researchers. Lanchester’sbitter feelings about the public’s receipt of his papers and books are graphicallyseen in his letter to the Daniel Guggenheim Medal Fund decades later. In a letterdated June 6, 1931, Lanchester writes: So far as aeronautical science is concerned, I cannot say that I experienced anything but discouragement; in the early days my theoretical work (backed by a certain amountof experimental veriﬁcation), mainly concerning the vortex theory of sustentationand the screw propeller, was refused by the two leading scientiﬁc societies in thiscountry, and I was seriously warned that my profession as an engineer would suffer ifI dabbled in a subject that was merely a dream of madmen! When I published my twovolumes in 1907 and 1908 they were well received on the whole, but this was mainlydue to the success of the brothers Wright, and the general interest aroused on thesubject. In 1899, he formed the Lanchester Motor Company, Limited, and sold automo- biles of his own design. He married in 1919, but had no children. Lanchestermaintained his interest in automobiles and related mechanical devices until hisdeath on March 8, 1946, at the age of 77. In 1908, Lanchester visited G¨ ottingen, Germany, and fully discussed his wing theory with Ludwig Prandtl and his student Theodore von Karman. Prandtl spokeno English, Lanchester spoke no German, and in light of Lanchester’s unclearway of explaining his ideas, there appeared to be little chance of understandingbetween the two parties. However, shortly after, Prandtl began to develop his ownwing theory, using a bound vortex along the span and assuming that the vortextrails downstream from both wing tips. The ﬁrst mention of Prandtl’s work onﬁnite-wing theory was made in a paper by O. Foppl in 1911, discussing some490 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow of Foppl’s experimental work on ﬁnite wings. Commenting on his results, Foppl says: They agree very closely with the theoretical investigation by Professor Prandtl on the current around an airplane with a ﬁnite span wing. Already Lanchester in hiswork, “Aerodynamics” (translated into German by C. and A. Runge), indicated thatto the two extremities of an airplane wing are attached two vortex ropes (Wirbelzopfe)which make possible the transition from the ﬂow around the airplane, which occursnearly according to Kutta’s theory, to the ﬂow of the undisturbed ﬂuid at both sides.These two vortex ropes continue the vortex which, according to Kutta’s theory, takesplace on the lamina. We are led to admit this owing to the Helmholtz theorem that vortices cannot end in the ﬂuid. At any rate these two vortex ropes have been made visible in theG¨ottingen Institute by emitting an ammonia cloud into the air. Prandtl’s theory is constructed on the consideration of this current in reality existing. In the same year, Prandtl expressed his own ﬁrst published words on the subject. In a paper given at a meeting of the Representatives of Aeronautical Science inG¨ottingen in November 1911, entitled “Results and Purposes of the Model Ex- perimental Institute of G¨ ottingen,” Prandtl states: Another theoretical research relates to the conditions of the current which is formed by the air behind an airplane. The lift generated by the airplane is, on account ofthe principle of action and reaction, necessarily connected with a descending currentbehind the airplane. Now it seemed very useful to investigate this descending currentin all its details. It appears that the descending current is formed by a pair of vortices,the vortex ﬁlaments of which start from the airplane wing tips. The distance of the twovortices is equal to the span of the airplane, their strength is equal to the circulation ofthe current around the airplane and the current in the vicinity of the airplane is fullygiven by the superposition of the uniform current with that of a vortex consisting ofthree rectilinear sections. In discussing the results of his theory, Prandtl goes on to state in the same paper: The same theory supplies, taking into account the variations of the current on theairplane which came from the lateral vortices, a relationship showing the dependenceof the airplane lift on the aspect ratio; in particular it gives the possibility of ex-trapolating the results thus obtained experimentally to the airplane of inﬁnite spanwing. From the maximum aspect ratios measured by us (1:9 to that of 1:∞) the liftsincrease further in marked degree—by some 30 or 40 percent. I would add here aremarkable result of this extrapolation, which is, that the results of Kutta’s theoryof the inﬁnite wing, at least so far as we are dealing with small cambers and smallangles of incidence, have been conﬁrmed by these experimental results. Starting from this line of thought we can attack the problem of calculating the surface of an airplane so that lift is distributed along its span in a determined manner,previously ﬁxed. The experimental trial of these calculations has not yet been made,but it will be in the near future. It is clear from the above comments that Prandtl was deﬁnitely following the model proposed earlier by Lanchester. Moreover, the major concern of the ﬁnite-wingtheory was ﬁrst in the calculation of lift—no mention is made of induced drag.CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 491 It is interesting to note that Prandtl’s theory ﬁrst began with a single horseshoe vortex, such as sketched in Figure 5.13. The results were not entirely satisfactory.During the period 1911–1918, Prandtl and his colleagues expanded and reﬁnedhis ﬁnite-wing theory, which evolved to the concept of a lifting line consistingof an inﬁnite number of horseshoe vortices, as sketched in Figure 5.15. In 1918,the term “induced drag” was coined by Max Munk, a colleague of Prandtl atG¨ottingen. Much of Prandtl’s development of ﬁnite-wing theory was classiﬁed secret by the German government during World War I. Finally, his lifting-linetheory was released to the outside world, and his ideas were published in En-glish in a special NACA report written by Prandtl and published in 1922, enti-tled “Applications of Modern Hydrodynamics to Aeronautics” (NACA TR 116).Hence, the theory we have outlined in Section 5.3 was well-established more than80 years ago. One of Prandtl’s strengths was the ability to base his thinking on sound ideas, and to apply intuition that resulted in relatively straightforward theoriesthat most engineers could understand and appreciate. This is in contrast to thedifﬁcult writings of Lanchester. As a result, the lifting theory for ﬁnite wings hascome down through the years identiﬁed as Prandtl’s lifting-line theory, although we have seen that Lanchester was the ﬁrst to propose the basic model on whichlifting-line theory is built. In light of Lanchester’s 1908 visit with Prandtl and Prandtl’s subsequent development of the lifting-line theory, there has been some discussion over theyears that Prandtl basically stole Lanchester’s ideas. However, this is clearly notthe case. We have seen in the above quotes that Prandtl’s group at G¨ ottingen wasgiving full credit to Lanchester as early as 1911. Moreover, Lanchester nevergave the world a clear and practical theory with which results could be readilyobtained—Prandtl did. Therefore, in this book we have continued the traditionof identifying the lifting-line theory with Prandtl’s name. On the other hand, forvery good reasons, in England and various places in western Europe, the theoryis labeled the Lanchester-Prandtl theory. To help put the propriety in perspective, Lanchester was awarded the Daniel Guggenheim Medal in 1936 (Prandtl had received this award some years earlier).In the medal citation, we ﬁnd the following words: Lanchester was the foremost person to propound the now famous theory of ﬂight based on the V ortex theory, so brilliantly followed up by Prandtl and others. He ﬁrstput forward his theory in a paper read before the Birmingham Natural History andPhilosophical Society on 19th June, 1894. In a second paper in 1897, in his twobooks published in 1907 and 1908, and in his paper read before the Institution ofAutomobile Engineers in 1916, he further developed this doctrine. Perhaps the best ﬁnal words on Lanchester are contained in this excerpt from his obituary found in the British periodical Flight in March 1946: And now Lanchester has passed from our ken but not from our thoughts. It is to behoped that the nation which neglected him during much of his lifetime will at any rateperpetuate his work by a memorial worthy of the “Grand Old Man” of aerodynamics.492 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 5.8 HISTORICAL NOTE: PRANDTL—THE MAN The modern science of aerodynamics rests on a strong fundamental foundation, a large percentage of which was established in one place by one man—at theUniversity of G¨ ottingen by Ludwig Prandtl. Prandtl never received a Nobel Prize,although his contributions to aerodynamics and ﬂuid mechanics are felt by manyto be of that caliber. Throughout this book, you will encounter his name in con-junction with major advances in aerodynamics: thin airfoil theory in Chapter 4,ﬁnite-wing theory in Chapter 5, supersonic shock- and expansion-wave theory inChapter 9, compressibility corrections in Chapter 11, and what may be his mostimportant contribution, namely, the boundary-layer concept in Chapter 17. Whowas this man who has had such a major impact on ﬂuid dynamics? Let us take acloser look. Ludwig Prandtl was born on February 4, 1874, in Freising, Bavaria. His father was Alexander Prandtl, a professor of surveying and engineering at theagricultural college at Weihenstephan, near Freising. Although three childrenwere born into the Prandtl family, two died at birth, and Ludwig grew up as anonly child. His mother, the former Magdalene Ostermann, had a protracted illness,and partly as a result of this, Prandtl became very close to his father. At an earlyage, Prandtl became interested in his father’s books on physics, machinery, andinstruments. Much of Prandtl’s remarkable ability to go intuitively to the heart ofa physical problem can be traced to his environment at home as a child, wherehis father, a great lover of nature, induced Ludwig to observe natural phenomenaand to reﬂect on them. In 1894, Prandtl began his formal scientiﬁc studies at the Technische Hochschule in Munich, where his principal teacher was the well-known mechan-ics professor, August Foppl. Six years later, he graduated from the University ofMunich with a Ph.D., with Foppl as his advisor. However, by this time Prandtlwas alone, his father having died in 1896 and his mother in 1898. By 1900, Prandtl had not done any work or shown any interest in ﬂuid me- chanics. Indeed, his Ph.D. thesis at Munich was in solid mechanics, dealing withunstable elastic equilibrium in which bending and distortion acted together. (Itis not generally recognized by people in ﬂuid dynamics that Prandtl continuedhis interest and research in solid mechanics through most of his life—this workis eclipsed, however, by his major contributions to the study of ﬂuid ﬂow.) How-ever, soon after graduation from Munich, Prandtl had his ﬁrst major encounterwith ﬂuid mechanics. Joining the Nuremburg works of the MaschinenfabrickAugsburg as an engineer, Prandtl worked in an ofﬁce designing mechanical equip-ment for the new factory. He was made responsible for redesigning an apparatusfor removing machine shavings by suction. Finding no reliable information inthe scientiﬁc literature about the ﬂuid mechanics of suction, Prandtl arrangedhis own experiments to answer a few fundamental questions about the ﬂow. Theresult of this work was his new design for shavings cleaners. The apparatus wasmodiﬁed with pipes of improved shape and size, and carried out satisfactory oper-ation at one-third its original power consumption. Prandtl’s contributions in ﬂuidmechanics had begun.CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 493 One year later, in 1901, he became Professor of Mechanics in the Mathemat- ical Engineering Department at the Technische Hochschule in Hanover. (Please note that in Germany a “technical high school” is equivalent to a technical univer-sity in the United States.) It was at Hanover that Prandtl enhanced and continuedhis new-found interest in ﬂuid mechanics. He also developed his boundary-layertheory and became interested in supersonic ﬂow through nozzles at Hanover.In 1904, Prandtl delivered his famous paper on the concept of the boundarylayer to the Third Congress on Mathematicians at Heidelberg. Entitled “ ¨Uber Flussigkeitsbewegung bei sehr kleiner Reibung,” Prandtl’s Heidelberg paper es-tablished the basis for most modern calculations of skin friction, heat transfer,and ﬂow separation (see Chapters 15 to 20). From that time on, the star of Prandtlwas to rise meteorically. Later that year, he moved to the prestigious Universityof G¨ ottingen to become Director of the Institute for Technical Physics, later to berenamed Applied Mechanics. Prandtl spent the remainder of his life at G¨ ottingen,building his laboratory into the world’s greatest aerodynamic research center ofthe 1904–1930 time period. At G¨ ottingen, during 1905–1908 Prandtl carried out numerous experiments on supersonic ﬂow through nozzles and developed oblique shock- and expansion-wave theory (see Chapter 9). He took the ﬁrst photographs of the supersonicﬂow through nozzles, using a special schlieren optical system (see Chapter 4 ofReference 21). From 1910 to 1920, he devoted most of his efforts to low-speedaerodynamics, principally airfoil and wing theory, developing the famous lifting-line theory for ﬁnite wings (see Section 5.3). Prandtl returned to high-speed ﬂowsin the 1920s, during which he contributed to the evolution of the famous Prandtl-Glauert compressibility correction (see Sections 11.4 and 11.11). By the 1930s, Prandtl was recognized worldwide as the “elder statesman” of ﬂuid dynamics. Although he continued to do research in various areas, includingstructural mechanics and meteorology, his “Nobel Prize-level” contributions toﬂuid dynamics had all been made. Prandtl remained at G¨ ottingen throughout theturmoil of World War II, engrossed in his work and seemingly insulated fromthe intense political and physical disruptions brought about by Nazi Germany. Infact, the German Air Ministry provided Prandtl’s laboratory with new equipmentand ﬁnancial support. Prandtl’s attitude at the end of the war is reﬂected in hiscomments to a U.S. Army interrogation team that swept through G¨ ottingen in1945; he complained about bomb damage to the roof of his house, and he askedhow the Americans planned to support his current and future research. Prandtlwas 70 at the time and was still going strong. However, the fate of Prandtl’slaboratory at this time is summed up in the words of Irmgard Flugge-Lotz andWilhelm Flugge, colleagues of Prandtl, who wrote 28 years later in the Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics (V ol. 5, 1973): World War II swept over all of us. At its end some of the research equipment was dismantled, and most of the research staff was scattered with the winds. Many are nowin this country (the United States) and in England, some have returned. The seedssown by Prandtl have sprouted in many places, and there are now many “secondgrowth” G¨ ottingers who do not even know that they are.494 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 5.51 Ludwig Prandtl (1875–1953). (© Emilio Segrè Visual Archives/American Institute of Physics/Science Source ). What type of person was Prandtl? By all accounts he was a gracious man, studious, likable, friendly, and totally focused on those things that interested him. He enjoyed music and was an accomplished pianist. Figure 5.51 shows a ratherintrospective man busily at work. One of Prandtl’s most famous students, Theodorvon K´ arm´ an, wrote in his autobiography The Wind and Beyond (Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1967) that Prandtl bordered on being naive. A favorite storyalong these lines is that, in 1909, Prandtl decided that he should be married, buthe did not know quite what to do. He ﬁnally wrote to Mrs. Foppl, the wife of hisrespected teacher, asking permission to marry one of her two daughters. Prandtland Foppl’s daughters were acquainted, but nothing more than that. Moreover,Prandtl did not stipulate which daughter. The Foppl’s made a family decision thatPrandtl should marry the elder daughter, Gertrude. This story from von Karmanhas been disputed in recent years by a Prandtl relative. Nevertheless, the marriageCHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 495 took place, leading to a happy relationship. The Prandtl’s had two daughters, born in 1914 and 1917. Prandtl was considered a tedious lecturer because he could hardly make a statement without qualifying it. However, he attracted excellent students who laterwent on to distinguish themselves in ﬂuid mechanics—such as Jakob Ackeret inZurich, Switzerland, Adolf Busemann in Germany, and Theodor von K´ arm´ an atAachen, Germany, and later at Cal Tech in the United States. Prandtl died in 1953. He was clearly the father of modern aerodynamics—a monumental ﬁgure in ﬂuid dynamics. His impact will be felt for centuries tocome. 5.9 SUMMARY Return to the chapter road map in Figure 5.7, and review the straightforward pathwe have taken during the development of ﬁnite-wing theory. Make certain thatyou feel comfortable with the ﬂow of ideas before proceeding further. A brief summary of the important results of this chapter follows: The wing-tip vortices from a ﬁnite wing induce a downwash which reducesthe angle of attack effectively seen by a local airfoil section: α eff=α−αi (5.1) In turn, the presence of downwash results in a component of drag deﬁned asinduced drag D i. V ortex sheets and vortex ﬁlaments are useful in modeling the aerodynamics ofﬁnite wings. The velocity induced by a directed segment dlof a vortex ﬁlament is given by the Biot-Savart law: dV=/Gamma1 4πdl×r |r|3(5.5) In Prandtl’s classical lifting-line theory, the ﬁnite wing is replaced by a singlespanwise lifting line along which the circulation /Gamma1(y)varies. A system of vortices trails downstream from the lifting line, which induces a downwash atthe lifting line. The circulation distribution is determined from the fundamentalequation α(y 0)=/Gamma1(y0) πV∞c(y0)+αL=0(y0)+1 4πV∞/integraldisplayb/2 −b/2(d/Gamma1/dy)dy y0−y(5.23)496 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Results from classical lifting-line theory: Elliptic wing:Downwash is constant: w=−/Gamma1 0 2b(5.35) αi=CL πAR(5.42) CD,i=C2 L πAR(5.43) a=a0 1+a0/πAR(5.69) General wing: CD,i=C2 L πAR(1+δ)=C2 L πeAR(5.61) and (5.62) a=a0 1+(a0/πAR)(1 +τ)(5.70) For low-aspect-ratio wings, swept wings, and delta wings, lifting-surface the- ory must be used. In modern aerodynamics, such lifting-surface theory isimplemented by the vortex panel or the vortex lattice techniques. 5.10 PROBLEMS 5.1Consider a vortex ﬁlament of strength /Gamma1in the shape of a closed circular loop of radius R. Obtain an expression for the velocity induced at the center of the loop in terms of /Gamma1andR. 5.2Consider the same vortex ﬁlament as in Problem 5.1. Consider also astraight line through the center of the loop, perpendicular to the plane ofthe loop. Let Abe the distance along this line, measured from the plane of the loop. Obtain an expression for the velocity at distance Aon the line, as induced by the vortex ﬁlament. 5.3The measured lift slope for the NACA 23012 airfoil is 0.1080 degree −1, andαL=0=−1.3◦. Consider a ﬁnite wing using this airfoil, with AR =8 and taper ratio =0.8. Assume that δ=τ. Calculate the lift and induced drag coefﬁcients for this wing at a geometric angle of attack =7◦.CHAPTER 5Incompressible Flow over Finite Wings 497 5.4The Piper Cherokee (a light, single-engine general aviation aircraft) has a wing area of 170 ft2and a wing span of 32 ft. Its maximum gross weight is 2450 lb. The wing uses an NACA 65-415 airfoil, which has a lift slope of0.1033 degree −1andαL=0=−3◦. Assume τ=0.12. If the airplane is cruising at 120 mi/h at standard sea level at its maximum gross weight andis in straight-and-level ﬂight, calculate the geometric angle of attack of thewing. 5.5Consider the airplane and ﬂight conditions given in Problem 5.4. The spanefﬁciency factor efor the complete airplane is generally much less than that for the ﬁnite wing alone. Assume e=0.64. Calculate the induced drag for the airplane in Problem 5.4. 5.6Consider a ﬁnite wing with an aspect ratio of 6. Assume an elliptical liftdistribution. The lift slope for the airfoil section is 0.1/degree. Calculateand compare the lift slopes for (a) a straight wing, and (b) a swept wing,with a half-chord line sweep of 45 degrees. 5.7Repeat Problem 5.6, except for a lower aspect ratio of 3. From acomparison of the results from these two problems, draw someconclusions about the effect of wing sweep on the lift slope, and how themagnitude of this effect is affected by aspect ratio. 5.8In Problem 1.19 we noted that the Wright brothers, in the design of their1900 and 1901 gliders, used aerodynamic data from the Lilienthal tablegiven in Figure 1.65. They chose a design angle of attack of 3 degrees,corresponding to a design lift coefﬁcient of 0.546. When they tested theirgliders at Kill Devil Hills near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1900 and1901, however, they measured only one-third the amount of lift they hadoriginally calculated on the basis of the Lilienthal table. This led theWrights to question the validity of Lilienthal’s data, and this cast a pall onthe Lilienthal table that has persisted to the present time. However, inReference 58 this author shows that the Lilienthal data are reasonablyvalid, and that the Wrights misinterpreted the data in the Lilienthal table inthree respects (see pages 209–216 of Reference 58). One of these respectswas the difference in aspect ratio. The Wrights’ 1900 glider hadrectangular wings with an aspect ratio of 3.5, whereas the data in theLilienthal table were taken with a wing with an ogival planform taperingto a point at the tip and with an aspect ratio of 6.48. The Wrights seemednot to appreciate the aerodynamic importance of aspect ratio at the time,and even if they had, there was no existing theory that would have allowedthem to correct the Lilienthal data for their design. (Prandtl’s lifting linetheory appeared 18 years later.) Given just the difference in aspect ratiobetween the Wrights’ glider and the test model used by Lilienthal, whatvalue of lift coefﬁcient should the Wrights have used instead of the valueof 0.546 they took straight from the table? (Note: There are two other misinterpretations by the Wrights that resulted in their calculation of liftbeing too high; see Reference 58 for details.)498 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 5.9Consider the Supermarine Spitﬁre shown in Figure 5.19. The ﬁrst version of the Spitﬁre was the Mk I, which ﬁrst ﬂew in 1936. Its maximumvelocity is 362 mi/h at an altitude of 18,500 ft. Its weight is 5820 lb, wingarea is 242 ft 2, and wing span is 36.1 ft. It is powered by a supercharged Merlin engine, which produced 1050 horsepower at 18,500 ft. (a) Cal-culate the induced drag coefﬁcient of the Spitﬁre at the ﬂight condition of V maxat 18,500 ft. (b) What percentage of the total drag coefﬁcient is the induced drag coefﬁcient? Note: To calculate the total drag, we note that in steady, level ﬂight of the airplane, T=D, where Tis the thrust from the propeller. In turn, the thrust is related to the power by the basic mechanicalrelation TV ∞=P, where Pis the power supplied by the propeller-engine combination. Because of aerodynamic losses experienced by the propeller, Pis less than the shaft power provided by the engine by a ratio, η, deﬁned as the propeller efﬁciency. That is, if HP is the shaft horsepower providedby the engine, and since 550 ft ·lb/s equals 1 horsepower, then the power provided by the engine-propeller combination in foot-pounds per secondisP=550η HP. See Chapter 6 of Reference 2 for more details. For this problem, assume the propeller efﬁciency for the Spitﬁre is 0.9. 5.10 If the elliptical wing of the Spitﬁre in Problem 5.9 were replaced by atapered wing with a taper ratio of 0.4, everything else remaining the same,calculate the induced drag coefﬁcient. Compare this value with thatobtained in Problem 5.9. What can you conclude about the relative effectof planform shape change on the drag of the airplane at high speeds? 5.11 Consider the Spitﬁre in Problem 5.9 on its landing approach at sea levelwith a landing velocity of 70 mi/h. Calculate the induced drag coefﬁcientfor this low-speed case. Compare your result with the high-speed case inProblem 5.9. From this, what can you conclude about the relativeimportance of the induced drag coefﬁcient at low speeds compared to thatat high speeds?CHAPTER 6 Three-Dimensional Incompressible Flow Treat nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone, all in perspective. Paul C´ ezanne, 1890 PREVIEW BOX We go three-dimensional in this chapter. For such a huge and complex subject, this chapter is mercifullyshort. It has only three objectives. This ﬁrst is to seewhat happens when the circular cylinder studied inChapter 3 morphs into a sphere—how do we mod-ify the theory to account for the three-dimensionalﬂow over a sphere, and how are the results changed from those for a circular cylinder? The second is todemonstrate a general phenomenon in aerodynamics known as the three-dimensional relieving effect. The third is to brieﬂy examine the aerodynamic ﬂow over acomplete three-dimensional ﬂight vehicle. Achievingthese objectives is important; they will further openyour mind to the wonders of aerodynamics. Read on,and enjoy. 6.1 INTRODUCTION To this point in our aerodynamic discussions, we have been working mainly in a two-dimensional world; the ﬂows over the bodies treated in Chapter 3 and theairfoils in Chapter 4 involved only two dimensions in a single plane—so-calledplanar ﬂows. In Chapter 5, the analyses of a ﬁnite wing were carried out in theplane of the wing, in spite of the fact that the detailed ﬂow over a ﬁnite wing is trulythree-dimensional. The relative simplicity of dealing with two dimensions (i.e.,having only two independent variables) is self-evident and is the reason why alarge bulk of aerodynamic theory deals with two-dimensional ﬂows. Fortunately, 499500 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow the two-dimensional analyses go a long way toward understanding many practical ﬂows, but they also have distinct limitations. The real world of aerodynamic applications is three-dimensional. However, because of the addition of one more independent variable, the analyses generallybecome more complex. The accurate calculation of three-dimensional ﬂow ﬁeldshas been, and still is, one of the most active areas of aerodynamic research. The purpose of this book is to present the fundamentals of aerodynamics. Therefore, it is important to recognize the predominance of three-dimensionalﬂows, although it is beyond our scope to go into detail. Therefore, the purpose ofthis chapter is to introduce some very basic considerations of three-dimensionalincompressible ﬂow. This chapter is short; we do not even need a road map toguide us through it. Its function is simply to open the door to the analysis ofthree-dimensional ﬂow. The governing ﬂuid ﬂow equations have already been developed in three dimensions in Chapters 2 and 3. In particular, if the ﬂow is irrotational, Equa-tion (2.154) states that V=∇φ (2.154) where, if the ﬂow is also incompressible, the velocity potential is given byLaplace’s equation: ∇ 2φ=0 (3.40) Solutions of Equation (3.40) for ﬂow over a body must satisfy the ﬂow-tangencyboundary condition on the body, that is, V·n=0 (3.48a) where nis a unit vector normal to the body surface. In all of the above equations, φis, in general, a function of three-dimensional space; for example, in spherical coordinates φ=φ(r,θ,/Phi1 ) . Let us use these equations to treat some elementary three-dimensional incompressible ﬂows. 6.2 THREE-DIMENSIONAL SOURCE Return to Laplace’s equation written in spherical coordinates, as given by Equa-tion (3.43). Consider the velocity potential given by φ=−C r(6.1) where Cis a constant and ris the radial coordinate from the origin. Equation (6.1) satisﬁes Equation (3.43), and hence it describes a physically possible incom-pressible, irrotational three-dimensional ﬂow. Combining Equation (6.1) with thedeﬁnition of the gradient in spherical coordinates, Equation (2.18), we obtain V=∇φ=C r2er (6.2)CHAPTER 6Three-Dimensional Incompressible Flow 501 Figure 6.1 Three-dimensional (point) source. In terms of the velocity components, we have Vr=C r2(6.3a) Vθ=0 (6.3b) V/Phi1=0 (6.3c) Clearly, Equation (6.2), or Equations (6.3 atoc), describes a ﬂow with straight streamlines emanating from the origin, as sketched in Figure 6.1. Moreover, from Equation (6.2) or (6.3 a), the velocity varies inversely as the square of the distance from the origin. Such a ﬂow is deﬁned as a three-dimensional source. Sometimes it is called simply a point source, in contrast to the two-dimensional line source discussed in Section 3.10. To evaluate the constant Cin Equation (6.3 a), consider a sphere of radius r and surface Scentered at the origin. From Equation (2.46), the mass ﬂow across the surface of this sphere is Mass ﬂow =................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SρV·dS Hence, the volume ﬂow, denoted by λ, is λ=................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SV·dS (6.4) On the surface of the sphere, the velocity is a constant value equal to Vr=C/r2 and is normal to the surface. Hence, Equation (6.4) becomes λ=C r24πr2=4πC Hence, C=λ 4π(6.5)502 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Substituting Equation (6.5) into (6.3 a), we ﬁnd Vr=λ 4πr2(6.6) Compare Equation (6.6) with its counterpart for a two-dimensional source given by Equation (3.62). Note that the three-dimensional effect is to cause an inverser-squared variation and that the quantity 4π appears rather than 2π . Also, sub- stituting Equation (6.5) into (6.1), we obtain, for a point source, φ=−λ 4πr(6.7) In the above equations, λis deﬁned as the strength of the source. When λis a negative quantity, we have a point sink. 6.3 THREE-DIMENSIONAL DOUBLET Consider a sink and source of equal but opposite strength located at points O andA, as sketched in Figure 6.2. The distance between the source and sink is l. Consider an arbitrary point Plocated a distance rfrom the sink and a distance r1 from the source. From Equation (6.7), the velocity potential at Pis φ=−λ 4π/parenleftbigg1 r1−1 r/parenrightbigg or φ=−λ 4πr−r1 rr1(6.8) Let the source approach the sink as their strengths become inﬁnite; that is, let l→0 as λ→∞ Figure 6.2 Source-sink pair. In the limit as l→0, a three-dimensional doublet is obtained.CHAPTER 6Three-Dimensional Incompressible Flow 503 In the limit, as l→0,r−r1→OB=lcosθ, and rr1→r2. Thus, in the limit, Equation (6.8) becomes φ=− lim l→0 λ→∞λ 4πr−r1 rr1=−λ 4πlcosθ r2 or φ=−μ 4πcosθ r2(6.9) where μ=/Lambda1l. The ﬂow ﬁeld produced by Equation (6.9) is a three-dimensional doublet; μis deﬁned as the strength of the doublet. Compare Equation (6.9) with its two-dimensional counterpart given in Equation (3.88). Note that the three- dimensional effects lead to an inverse r-squared variation and introduce a factor 4π, versus 2π for the two-dimensional case. From Equations (2.18) and (6.9), we ﬁnd V=∇φ=μ 2πcosθ r3er+μ 4πsinθ r3eθ+0e/Phi1 (6.10) The streamlines of this velocity ﬁeld are sketched in Figure 6.3. Shown are thestreamlines in the zrplane; they are the same in all the zrplanes (i.e., for all values of/Phi1). Hence, the ﬂow induced by the three-dimensional doublet is a series of stream surfaces generated by revolving the streamlines in Figure 6.3 about the zaxis. Compare these streamlines with the two-dimensional case illustrated in Figure 3.18; they are qualitatively similar but quantitatively different. Figure 6.3 Sketch of the streamlines in the zrplane (/Phi1=constant plane) for a three-dimensional doublet.504 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Note that the ﬂow in Figure 6.3 is independent of /Phi1; indeed, Equation (6.10) clearly shows that the velocity ﬁeld depends only on randθ. Such a ﬂow is deﬁned asaxisymmetric ﬂow. Once again, we have a ﬂow with two independent variables. For this reason, axisymmetric ﬂow is sometimes labeled “two-dimensional” ﬂow. However, it is quite different from the two-dimensional planar ﬂows discussedearlier. In reality, axisymmetric ﬂow is a degenerate three-dimensional ﬂow, andit is somewhat misleading to refer to it as “two-dimensional.” Mathematically,it has only two independent variables, but it exhibits some of the same physicalcharacteristics as general three-dimensional ﬂows, such as the three-dimensionalrelieving effect to be discussed later. 6.4 FLOW OVER A SPHERE Consider again the ﬂow induced by the three-dimensional doublet illustrated inFigure 6.3. Superimpose on this ﬂow a uniform velocity ﬁeld of magnitude V ∞in the negative zdirection. Since we are more comfortable visualizing a freestream that moves horizontally, say, from left to right, let us ﬂip the coordinate systemin Figure 6.3 on its side. The picture shown in Figure 6.4 results. Examining Figure 6.4, the spherical coordinates of the freestream are V r=−V∞cosθ (6.11a) Vθ=V∞sinθ (6.11b) V/Phi1=0 (6.11c) Adding Vr,Vθ, and V/Phi1for the free stream, Equations (6.11 atoc), to the repre- sentative components for the doublet given in Equation (6.10), we obtain, for the Figure 6.4 The superposition of a uniform ﬂow and a three-dimensional doublet.CHAPTER 6Three-Dimensional Incompressible Flow 505 combined ﬂow, Vr=−V∞cosθ+μ 2πcosθ r3=−/parenleftbigg V∞−μ 2πr3/parenrightbigg cosθ (6.12) Vθ=V∞sinθ+μ 4πsinθ r3=/parenleftbigg V∞+μ 4πr3/parenrightbigg sinθ (6.13) V/Phi1=0 (6.14) To ﬁnd the stagnation points in the ﬂow, set Vr=Vθ=0 in Equations (6.12) and (6.13). From Equation (6.13), Vθ=0 gives sin θ=0; hence, the stagnation points are located at θ=0 andπ. From Equation (6.12), with Vr=0, we obtain V∞−μ 2πR3=0 (6.15) where r=Ris the radial coordinate of the stagnation points. Solving Equa- tion (6.15) for R, we obtain R=/parenleftbiggμ 2πV∞/parenrightbigg1/3 (6.16) Hence, there are two stagnation points, both on the zaxis, with (r,θ)coordinates /bracketleftBigg/parenleftbiggμ 2πV∞/parenrightbigg1/3 ,0/bracketrightBigg and/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbiggμ 2πV∞/parenrightbigg1/3 ,π/bracketrightBigg Insert the value of r=Rfrom Equation (6.16) into the expression for Vr given by Equation (6.12). We obtain Vr=−/parenleftbigg V∞−μ 2πR3/parenrightbigg cosθ=−/bracketleftbigg V∞−μ 2π/parenleftbigg2πV∞ μ/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg cosθ =−(V∞−V∞)cosθ=0 Thus, Vr=0 when r=Rforall values ofθand/Phi1. This is precisely the ﬂow-tangency condition for ﬂow over a sphere of radius R. Hence, the velocity ﬁeld given by Equations (6.12) to (6.14) is the incompressible ﬂow over a sphere of radius R. This ﬂow is shown in Figure 6.5; it is qualitatively similar to the ﬂow over the cylinder shown in Figure 3.19, but quantitatively the two ﬂows aredifferent. Figure 6.5 Schematic of the incompressible ﬂow over a sphere.506 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow On the surface of the sphere, where r=R, the tangential velocity is obtained from Equation (6.13) as follows: Vθ=/parenleftbigg V∞+μ 4πR3/parenrightbigg sinθ (6.17) From Equation (6.16), μ=2πR3V∞ (6.18) Substituting Equation (6.18) into (6.17), we have Vθ=/parenleftbigg V∞+1 4π2πR3V∞ R3/parenrightbigg sinθ or Vθ=3 2V∞sinθ (6.19) The maximum velocity occurs at the top and bottom points of the sphere, and its magnitude is3 2V∞. Compare these results with the two-dimensional circular cylinder case given by Equation (3.100). For the two-dimensional ﬂow, the max-imum velocity is 2 V ∞. Hence, for the same V∞, the maximum surface velocity on a sphere is lessthan that for a cylinder. The ﬂow over a sphere is somewhat “relieved” in comparison with the ﬂow over a cylinder. The ﬂow over a spherehas an extra dimension in which to move out of the way of the solid body; theﬂow can move sideways as well as up and down. In contrast, the ﬂow over acylinder is more constrained; it can only move up and down. Hence, the maxi-mum velocity on a sphere is less than that on a cylinder. This is an example of thethree-dimensional relieving effect, which is a general phenomenon for all types of three-dimensional ﬂows. The pressure distribution on the surface of the sphere is given by Equa- tions (3.38) and (6.19) as follows: C p=1−/parenleftbiggV V∞/parenrightbigg2 =1−/parenleftbigg3 2sinθ/parenrightbigg2 or Cp=1−9 4sin2θ (6.20) Compare Equation (6.20) with the analogous result for a circular cylinder given byEquation (3.101). Note that the absolute magnitude of the pressure coefﬁcient on asphere is less than that for a cylinder—again, an example of the three-dimensionalrelieving effect. The pressure distributions over a sphere and a cylinder are com-pared in Figure 6.6, which dramatically illustrates the three-dimensional relievingeffect. 6.4.1 Comment on the Three-Dimensional Relieving Effect There is a good physical reason for the three-dimensional relieving effect. First,visualize the two-dimensional ﬂow over a circular cylinder. In order to move outCHAPTER 6Three-Dimensional Incompressible Flow 507 Figure 6.6 The pressure distribution over the surface of a sphere and a cylinder. Illustration of the three-dimensional relieving effect. of the way of the cylinder, the ﬂow has only two ways to go: riding up-and-over and down-and-under the cylinder. In contrast, visualize the three-dimensionalﬂow over a sphere. In addition to moving up-and-over and down-and-under thesphere, the ﬂow can now move sideways, to the left and right over the sphere.This sidewise movement relieves the previous constraint on the ﬂow; the ﬂowdoes not have to speed up so much to get out of the way of the sphere, andtherefore the pressure in the ﬂow does not have to change so much. The ﬂowis “less stressed”; it moves around the sphere in a more relaxed fashion—it is“relieved,” and consequently the changes in velocity and pressure are smaller. 6.5 GENERAL THREE-DIMENSIONAL FLOWS: PANEL TECHNIQUES In modern aerodynamic applications, three-dimensional, inviscid, incompressibleﬂows are almost always calculated by means of numerical panel techniques. Thephilosophy of the two-dimensional panel methods discussed in previous chaptersis readily extended to three dimensions. The details are beyond the scope of thisbook—indeed, there are dozens of different variations, and the resulting computerprograms are frequently long and sophisticated. However, the general idea behindall such panel programs is to cover the three-dimensional body with panels over508 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow z y xV∞n Figure 6.7 Schematic of three-dimensional source panels distributed over a general nonlifting body. which there is an unknown distribution of singularities (such as point sources, doublets, or vortices). Such paneling is illustrated in Figure 6.7. These unknownsare solved through a system of simultaneous linear algebraic equations generatedby calculating the induced velocity at control points on the panels and applying theﬂow-tangency condition. For a nonlifting body such as illustrated in Figure 6.7, adistribution of source panels is sufﬁcient. However, for a lifting body, both sourceand vortex panels (or their equivalent) are necessary. A striking example of theextent to which panel methods are now used for three-dimensional lifting bodiesis shown in Figure 6.8, which illustrates the paneling used for calculations madeby the Boeing Company of the potential ﬂow over a Boeing 747–space shuttlepiggyback combination. Such applications are very impressive; moreover, theyhave become an industry standard and are today used routinely as part of theairplane design process by the major aircraft companies. Examining Figures 6.7 and 6.8, one aspect stands out, namely, the geomet- ric complexity of distributing panels over the three-dimensional bodies. How doyou get the computer to “see” the precise shape of the body? How do you dis-tribute the panels over the body; that is, do you put more at the wing leadingedges and less on the fuselage, etc.? How many panels do you use? These are allnontrivial questions. It is not unusual for an aerodynamicist to spend weeks oreven a few months determining the best geometric distribution of panels over acomplex body. We end this section on the following note. From the time they were in- troduced in the 1960s, panel techniques have revolutionized the calculation ofCHAPTER 6Three-Dimensional Incompressible Flow 509 Figure 6.8 Panel distribution for the analysis of the Boeing 747 carrying the space shuttle orbiter. three-dimensional potential ﬂows. However, no matter how complex the applica- tion of these methods may be, the techniques are still based on the fundamentalswe have discussed in this and all the preceding chapters. You are encouraged topursue these matters further by reading the literature, particularly as it appears insuch journals as the Journal of Aircraft and the AIAA Journal. 6.6 APPLIED AERODYNAMICS: THE FLOW OVER A SPHERE—THE REAL CASE The present section is a complement to Section 3.18, in which the real ﬂowover a circular cylinder was discussed. Since the present chapter deals with three-dimensional ﬂows, it is ﬁtting at this stage to discuss the three-dimensional analogof the circular cylinder, namely, the sphere. The qualitative features of the real ﬂowover a sphere are similar to those discussed for a cylinder in Section 3.18—thephenomenon of ﬂow separation, the variation of drag coefﬁcient with a Reynoldsnumber, the precipitous drop in drag coefﬁcient when the ﬂow transits fromlaminar to turbulent ahead of the separation point at the critical Reynolds number,and the general structure of the wake. These items are similar for both cases.However, because of the three-dimensional relieving effect, the ﬂow over a sphere510 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Figure 6.9 Laminar ﬂow case: Instantaneous ﬂow past a sphere in water. Re =15,000. Flow is made visible by dye in the water. (© ONERA The French Aerospace Lab). isquantitatively different from that for a cylinder. These differences are the subject of the present section. The laminar ﬂow over a sphere is shown in Figure 6.9. Here, the Reynolds number is 15,000, certainly low enough to maintain laminar ﬂow over the spherical surface. However, in response to the adverse pressure gradient on the back surfaceof the sphere predicted by inviscid, incompressible ﬂow theory (see Section 6.4and Figure 6.6), the laminar ﬂow readily separates from the surface. Indeed,in Figure 6.9, separation is clearly seen on the forward surface, slightly ahead of the vertical equator of the sphere. Thus, a large, fat wake trails downstreamof the sphere, with a consequent large pressure drag on the body (analogousto that discussed in Section 3.18 for a cylinder.) In contrast, the turbulent ﬂowcase is shown in Figure 6.10. Here, the Reynolds number is 30,000, still a lownumber normally conducive to laminar ﬂow. However, in this case, turbulentﬂow is induced artiﬁcially by the presence of a wire loop in a vertical plane onthe forward face. (Trip wires are frequently used in experimental aerodynamicsto induce transition to turbulent ﬂow; this is in order to study such turbulentﬂows under conditions where they would not naturally exist.) Because the ﬂow isturbulent, separation takes place much farther over the back surface, resulting ina thinner wake, as can be seen by comparing Figures 6.9 and 6.10. Consequently,the pressure drag is less for the turbulent case. The variation of drag coefﬁcient C Dwith the Reynolds number for a sphere is shown in Figure 6.11. Compare this ﬁgure with Figure 3.44 for a circular cylinder;CHAPTER 6Three-Dimensional Incompressible Flow 511 Figure 6.10 Turbulent ﬂow case: Instantaneous ﬂow past a sphere in water. Re =30,000. The turbulent ﬂow is forced by a trip wire hoop ahead of the equator, causing the laminar ﬂow to become turbulent suddenly. The ﬂow is made visible by air bubbles in water.

Figure 6.11 Variation of drag coefﬁcient with Reynolds number for a sphere (Data taken from Schlichting, H.: Boundary Layer Theory, 7th ed., McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, 1979).512 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow theCDvariations are qualitatively similar, both with a precipitous decrease in CD near a critical Reynolds number of 300,000, coinciding with natural transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow. However, quantitatively the two curves are quite different. In the Reynolds number range most appropriate to practical problems,that is, for Re >1000, the values of C Dfor the sphere are considerably smaller than those for a cylinder—a classic example of the three-dimensional relievingeffect. Reﬂecting on Figure 3.44 for the cylinder, note that the value of C Dfor Re slightly less than the critical value is about 1 and drops to 0.3 for Re slightlyabove the critical value. In contrast, for the sphere as shown in Figure 6.11, C D is about 0.4 in the Reynolds number range below the critical value and drops toabout 0.1 for Reynolds numbers above the critical value. These variations in C D for both the cylinder and sphere are classic results in aerodynamics; you shouldkeep the actual C Dvalues in mind for future reference and comparisons. As a ﬁnal point in regard to both Figures 3.44 and 6.11, the value of the critical Reynolds number at which transition to turbulent ﬂow takes place upstream ofthe separation point is not a ﬁxed, universal number. Quite the contrary, transitionis inﬂuenced by many factors, as will be discussed in Part 4. Among these is theamount of turbulence in the freestream; the higher the freestream turbulence, themore readily transition takes place. In turn, the higher the freestream turbulence,the lower is the value of the critical Reynolds number. Because of this trend,calibrated spheres are used in wind-tunnel testing actually to assess the degreeof freestream turbulence in the test section, simply by measuring the value of thecritical Reynolds number on the sphere. 6.7 APPLIED AERODYNAMICS: AIRPLANE LIFT AND DRAG A three-dimensional object of primary interest to aerospace engineers is a wholeairplane such as shown in Figure 6.8, not just the ﬁnite wing discussed in Chapter 5.In this section we expand our horizons to consider lift and drag of a completeairplane conﬁguration. We emphasized in Section 1.5 that the aerodynamic force on any body moving through the air is due only to two basic sources, the pressure and shear stressdistributions exerted over the body surface. Lift is primarily created by the pressuredistribution; shear stress has only a minor effect on lift. We have used this fact,beginning in Chapter 3 through to the present chapter, where the assumption ofinviscid ﬂow has given us reasonable predictions of the lift on cylinders withcirculation, airfoils, and ﬁnite wings. Drag, on the other hand, is created by boththe pressure and shear stress distributions, and analyses based on just inviscidﬂow are not sufﬁcient for the prediction of drag. 6.7.1 Airplane Lift We normally think of wings as the primary component producing the lift of anairplane in ﬂight, and quite rightly so. However, even a pencil at an angle ofCHAPTER 6Three-Dimensional Incompressible Flow 513 attack will generate lift, albeit small. Hence, lift is produced by the fuselage of an airplane as well as the wing. The mating of a wing with a fuselage iscalled a wing-body combination. The lift of a wing-body combination is not obtained by simply adding the lift of the wing alone to the lift of the body alone.Rather, as soon as the wing and body are mated, the ﬂow ﬁeld over the bodymodiﬁes the ﬂow ﬁeld over the wing, and vice versa—this is called the wing-body interaction. There is no accurate analytical equation that can predict the lift of a wing- body combination, properly taking into account the nature of the wing-bodyaerodynamic interaction. Either the conﬁguration must be tested in a wind tunnel,or a computational ﬂuid dynamic calculation must be made. We cannot even sayin advance whether the combined lift will be greater or smaller than the sum of thetwo parts. For subsonic speeds, however, data obtained using different fuselagethicknesses, d, mounted on wings with different spans, b, show that the total lift for a wing-body combination is essentially constant for d/branging from 0 (wing only) to 6 (which would be an inordinately fat fuselage, with a short, stubby wing).Hence, the lift of the wing-body combination can be treated as simply the lift onthe complete wing by itself, including that portion of the wing that is masked bythe fuselage. This is illustrated in Figure 6.12. See Chapter 2 of Reference 65 formore details. Of course, other components of the airplane such as a horizontal tail, canard surfaces, and wing strakes can contribute to the lift, either in a positive or negativesense. Once again we emphasize that reasonably accurate predictions of lift on acomplete airplane can come only from wind tunnel tests, detailed computationalﬂuid dynamic calculations (such as the panel calculations illustrated by Fig-ure 6.8), and, of course, from actual ﬂight tests of the airplane. Lift on wing-body combination (a)( b)About the same as the lift on thewing of planform area S, whichincludes that part of the wingmasked by the fuselage Figure 6.12 Lift on a wing-body combination.514 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 6.7.2 Airplane Drag When you watch an airplane ﬂying overhead, or when you ride in an airplane, it is almost intuitive that your ﬁrst aerodynamic thought is about lift. You are witness-ing a machine that, in straight and level ﬂight, is producing enough aerodynamiclift to equal the weight of the machine. This keeps it in the air—a vital concern.But this is only part of the role of airplane aerodynamics. It is equally importantto produce this lift as efﬁciently as possible, that is, with as little drag as possible. The ratio of lift to drag, L/D, is a good measure of aerodynamic efﬁciency. A barn door will produce lift at angle of attack, but it also produces a lot of drag atthe same time—the L/Dfor a barn door is terrible. For such reasons, minimizing drag has been one of the strongest drivers in the historical development of appliedaerodynamics. And to minimize drag, we ﬁrst have to provide methods for itsestimation. As in the case of lift, the drag of an airplane cannot be obtained as the simple sum of the drag on each component. For example, for a wing-body combination,the drag is usually higher than the sum of the separate drag forces on the wingand the body, giving rise to an extra drag component called interference drag.For a more detailed discussion of airplane drag prediction, see Reference 65. Thesubject of drag prediction is so complex that whole books have been written aboutit; one classic is the book by Hoerner, Reference 112. In this section we will limit our discussion to the simple extension of Equation (5.63) for application to the whole airplane. Equation (5.63), copied below, appliesto a ﬁnite wing. C D=cd+C2 L πeAR(5.63) In Equation (5.63), CDis the total drag coefﬁcient for a ﬁnite wing, cdis the proﬁle drag coefﬁcient caused by skin friction and pressure drag due to ﬂowseparation, and C 2 L/πeAR is the induced drag coefﬁcient with the span efﬁciency factor edeﬁned by Equation (5.62). For the whole airplane, Equation (5.63) is rewritten as CD=CD,e+C2 L πeAR(6.21) where CDis the total drag coefﬁcient for the airplane and CD,eis deﬁned as the parasite drag coefﬁcient , which contains not only the proﬁle drag of the wing [cdin Equation (5.63)] but also the friction and pressure drag of the tail surfaces, fuselage, engine nacelles, landing gear, and any other component of the airplanethat is exposed to the airﬂow. Because of changes in the ﬂow ﬁeld around theairplane—especially changes in the amount of separated ﬂow over parts of theairplane—as the angle of attack is varied, C D,ewill change with angle of attack. Because the lift coefﬁcient, CL, is a speciﬁc function of angle of attack, we can consider that CD,eis a function of CL. A reasonable approximation for thisCHAPTER 6Three-Dimensional Incompressible Flow 515 function is CD,e=CD,o+rC2 L (6.22) where ris an empirically determined constant. Since at zero lift, CL=0, then Equation (6.22) deﬁnes CD,oas the parasite drag coefﬁcient at zero lift, or more commonly, the zero-lift drag coefﬁcient . With Equation (6.22), we can write Equation (6.21) as CD=CD,o+/parenleftbigg r+1 πeAR/parenrightbigg C2 L (6.23) In Equations (6.21) and (6.23), eis the familiar span efﬁciency factor, which takes into account the nonelliptical lift distribution on wings of general shape (see Section 5.3.2). Let us now redeﬁne e so that it also includes the effect of the variation of parasite drag with lift; that is, let us write Equation (6.23) in the form CD=CD,o+C2 L πeAR(6.24) where CD,ois the parasite drag coefﬁcient at zero lift (or simply the zero-lift drag coefﬁcient for the airplane) and the term C2 L/(πeAR) is the drag coefﬁcient due to lift including both induced drag and the contribution to parasite drag due to lift. In Equation (6.24), the redeﬁned eis called the Oswald efﬁciency factor (named after W. Bailey Oswald, who ﬁrst established this terminology in NACAReport No. 408 in 1932). The use of the symbol efor the Oswald efﬁciency factor has become standard in the literature, and that is why we continue this standardhere. To avoid confusion, keep in mind that eintroduced for a ﬁnite wing in Section 5.3.2 and used in Equation (6.21) is the span efﬁciency factor for a ﬁnitewing, and the eused in Equation (6.24) is the Oswald efﬁciency factor for a complete airplane. These are two different numbers; the Oswald efﬁciency factorfor different airplanes typically varies between 0.7 and 0.85 whereas the spanefﬁciency factor typically varies between 0.9 and at most 1.0 and is a function ofwing aspect ratio and taper ratio as demonstrated in Figure 5.20. Daniel Raymer inReference 113 gives the following empirical expression for the Oswald efﬁciencyfactor for straight-wing aircraft, based on data obtained from actual airplanes: e=1.78 /parenleftbig1−0.045 AR0.68/parenrightbig−0.64 (6.25) Raymer notes that Equation (6.25) should be used for conventional aspect ratiosfor normal airplanes, and not for the very large aspect ratios (on the order of 25or higher) associated with sailplanes. Equation (6.24) conveys all the information you need to calculate the drag of a complete airplane, but to use it you have to know the zero-lift drag coefﬁcientand the Oswald efﬁciency factor. Equation (6.24) is called the drag polar for the airplane, representing the variation of C Dwith CL. It is the cornerstone for conceptual airplane design and for predictions of the performance of a givenaircraft (see Reference 65 for more details).516 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow EXAMPLE 6.1 Return again to the photograph of the Seversky P-35 shown in Figure 3.2. This airplane has a wing planform area of 220 ft2and a wingspan of 36 ft. Also, examine again the drag breakdown for the Seversky XP-41 given in Figure 1.58. In Example 1.12 we assumedthat the drag breakdown for the XP-41, being an airplane very similar to the P-35, appliedto the P-35 as well. We do the same here. Using the data given in Figure 1.58, calculatethe zero-lift drag coefﬁcient for the P-35. ■Solution For the drag breakdown shown in Figure 1.58, condition 18 is that for the complete airplaneconﬁguration. For condition 18, the total drag coefﬁcient is given as C D=0.0275 when the aircraft is at the particular angle of attack where CL=0.15. That is, we know simultaneous values of CDandCLthat can be used in Equation (6.24). In that equation, AR=b2 s=(36)2 220=5.89 and the Oswald efﬁciency factor from Equation (6.25) is e=1.78(1−0.045AR0.68)−0.64 =1.78 [1 −0.045(5.89)0.68]−0.64 =1.78 [1 −0.045(3.339)] −0.64 =0.873 Thus, Equation (6.24) gives for the zero-lift drag coefﬁcient CD,o=CD−C2 L πeAR =0.0275 −(0.15)2 π(0.873)(5.89) or, CD,o=0.026 The late Larry Loftin, in his excellent book Quest for Performance: The Evolution of Modern Aircraft (Reference 45), tabulated the zero-lift drag coefﬁcient extracted from ﬂight performance data for a large number of historic airplanes from the twentieth century.His tabulated value for the Seversky P-35 is C D,o=0.0251. Note that the value of CD,o=0.026 calculated in this example agrees within 3.6 percent. Airplane Lift-to-Drag Ratio The dimensional analysis discussed in Sec- tion 1.7 proves that CL,CD, and hence the lift-to-drag ratio CL/CD, at a given Mach number and Reynolds number depend only on the shape of the body and the angle of attack. This is reinforced by the sketches shown in Figure 6.13. For aCHAPTER 6Three-Dimensional Incompressible Flow 517 0.4 0 2468 Angle of attack, degrees Angle of attack, degrees Angle of attack, degrees10 12 14 160.81.6CL CD L/D1.2 0.04 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 160.080.16 0.12 4 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 1681612 Figure 6.13 Typical variations of lift and drag coefﬁcients and lift-to-drag ratio for a generic small propeller-driven generalaviation airplane (based on calculations fromChapter 6 of Anderson, John D., Jr.:Introduction to Flight, 6th ed., McGraw-HillBook Company, Boston, 2008). given airplane shape, Figure 6.13a gives the variation of CLwith the airplane angle of attack, α; Figure 6.13b gives the variation of CDwithα; and Figure 6.13c gives the lift-to-drag ratio CL/CDas a function of α. These are aerodynamic properties associated with a given airplane. Within reasonable Mach number and Reynolds number ranges, we can simply talk about thelift coefﬁcient, drag coefﬁcient, and lift-to-drag ratio as speciﬁc values at any speciﬁc angle of attack. Indeed, in518 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow Example 6.1 we calculated thezero-lift drag coefﬁcient for the Seversky P-35. We know that, strictly speaking, CD,owill depend on Mach number and Reynolds number, but for the normal ﬂight regime of the low-speed subsonic aircraft ger- mane to our present discussion, the variation of the airplane aerodynamic coefﬁ-cients with Mach number and Reynolds number is considered small. Hence, forexample, we can meaningfully talk about the C D,ofor the airplane. Examining Figure 6.13c, note that CL/CDﬁrst increases as αincreases, reaches a maximum value at a certain value of α, and then subsequently decreases asαincreases further. The maximum lift-to-drag ratio, ( L/D)max=(CL/CD)max, is a direct measure of the aerodynamic efﬁciency of the airplane, and therefore itsvalue is of great importance in airplane design and in the prediction of airplaneperformance (see, for example, References 2 and 65). Since ( L/D) maxis an aero- dynamic property of the airplane, we should be able to calculate its value fromother known aerodynamic properties. Let us see: C L CD=CL CD,o+C2 L/(πeAR)(6.26) For maximum CL/CD, differentiate Equation (6.26) with respect to CLand set the result equal to 0: d(CL/CD) dC L=CD,o+C2 L πeAR−CL[2CL/(πeAR)] [CD,o+C2 L/(πeAR)]2=0 Thus, CD,o+C2 L πeAR−2C2 L πeAR=0 or CD,o=C2 L πeAR(6.27) Equation (6.27) is an interesting intermediate result. It states that when the airplane is ﬂying at the speciﬁc angle of attack where the lift-to-drag ratio is maximum,the zero-lift drag and the drag due to lift are precisely equal. Solving Equation(6.27) for C L, we have CL=/radicalbig πeARCD,o (6.28) Equation (6.28) gives the value of CLwhen the airplane is ﬂying at ( L/D)max. Return to Equation (6.25), which gives CL/CDas a function of CL. By substituting the value of CLfrom Equation (6.28), which pertains just to the maximum value ofL/D, into Equation (6.25), we obtain for the maximum lift-to-drag ratio /parenleftbiggCL CD/parenrightbigg max=(πeARCD,o)1/2 CD,o+πeARCD,o πeARCHAPTER 6Three-Dimensional Incompressible Flow 519 or, /parenleftbiggCL CD/parenrightbigg max=(πeARCD,o)1/2 2CD,o(6.29) Equation (6.29) is powerful . It tells us that the maximum value of lift-to-drag ratio for a given airplane depends only on the zero-lift drag coefﬁcient CD,o, the Oswald efﬁciency factor e, and the wing aspect ratio. So our earlier supposition that ( L/D)max, being an aerodynamic property of the given airplane, should depend only on other aerodynamic properties, is correct, the other aerodynamic properties being simply CD,oande. EXAMPLE 6.2 Using the information obtained in Example 6.1, calculate the maximum lift-to-drag ratio for the Seversky P-35. ■Solution From Example 6.1, we have CD,o=0.026 e=0.873 AR=5.89 From Equation (6.29), we have /parenleftbiggCL CD/parenrightbigg max=(πeARCD,o)1/2 2CD,o =[π(0.873)(5.89)(0.026)]1/2 2(0.026) /parenleftbiggCL CD/parenrightbigg max=12.46 The value for ( L/D)maxfor the P-35 as tabulated by Loftin in Reference 45 is ( L/D)max= 11.8, which is within 5 percent of the value calculated here. 6.7.3 Application of Computational Fluid Dynamics for the Calculation of Lift and Drag The role of computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) for the numerical solution of the continuity, momentum, and energy equations is discussed in Section 2.17.2.Numerical solutions of the purely inviscid ﬂow equations are labeled “Eulersolutions”; the CFD results discussed in Chapter 13 are examples of such Eulersolutions. Numerical solutions of the general viscous ﬂow equations are labeled“Navier-Stokes solutions”; examples of such Navier-Stokes solutions are givenin Chapter 20.520 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow These numerical solutions of the continuity, momentum, and energy equa- tions give the variation of the ﬂow ﬁeld properties ( p,T, V , etc.) as a function of space and time throughout the ﬂow. This includes, of course, the pressure at the body surface. The shear stress at the surface is obtained from Equation (1.59),repeated below τ w=μ/parenleftbiggdV dy/parenrightbigg y=0(1.59) where the velocity gradient at the wall, (dV/dy)y=0, is obtained from the CFD solution of the ﬂow velocity at gridpoints adjacent to the wall using one-sideddifferences (see Section 2.17.2). Finally, by numerically integrating the pressureand shear stress distributions over the surface, the lift and drag of the airplane canbe obtained (see Section 1.5). This is how CFD results can be used to give liftand drag on a body. Some very recent CFD results for the ﬂow ﬁeld over a complete airplane are described in seven coordinated papers in the Journal of Aircraft , V ol. 46, No. 2, March–April 2009. These papers report CFD results obtained by different in-vestigators using different computer programs and algorithms for the ﬂow ﬁeldover the F-16XL cranked-wing conﬁguration shown in Figure 6.14.

WLFS Figure 6.14 Three-view of the F-16XL.CHAPTER 6Three-Dimensional Incompressible Flow 521 the Cranked-Arrow Wing Aerodynamics Project (CAWAP) organized by NASA and administered through the AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Technical Commit-tee, various investigators were invited to make CFD ﬂow ﬁeld calculations overthe F-16XL at various ﬂight conditions. The purpose is to compare the resultsin order to assess the state of the art of CFD calculations of ﬂow ﬁelds aroundcomplete airplane conﬁgurations, particularly with the airplane at relatively highangle of attack with large regions of separated ﬂow. A summary of the compar-isons and conclusions is given in Reference 114. Although the main thrust of thisproject was to evaluate and compare calculations of detailed ﬂow ﬁeld structureand surface pressure distributions, some comparisons of lift and drag coefﬁcientswere made. A representative comparison is given in Table 6.1, where C LandCD obtained from seven different investigations are tabulated. The results apply tothe F-16XL ﬂying at M ∞=0.36, angle of attack α=11.85◦, sideslip angle = 0.612◦, and Reynolds number =46.8×106. In Table 6.1, the different investi- gators are simply labeled by number; the actual sources and the particular CFDcodes are identiﬁed in Reference 114. Note that the discrepancy between the lowest and highest number obtained is 26 percent for C Land 42 percent for CD. However, if the results from Investigator 3 are not counted, the discrepancies are 6.7 percent for CLand 21.5 percent for CD. The three-dimensional ﬂow ﬁeld associated with the values of CLandCDin Table 6.1 is complex; it contains primary and secondary vortices much like thoseshown for ﬂow over a delta wing in Figure 5.41. The airplane is at both an angle ofattack and angle of sideslip, and the resulting ﬂow ﬁeld is highly three-dimensionalwith embedded vortices and large regions of ﬂow separation. This is a severe testfor any CFD code, and indeed is the reason why this case has been chosen here toillustrate the use of CFD for the calculation of lift and drag of a complete airplane.The test cases used in the Cranked-Arrow Wing Aerodynamics Project representperhaps the upper limit of complexity, and therefore the discrepancies betweenthe results of the different CFD codes may represent an upper bound—a kind ofworst-case scenario. With that caveat in mind, note that the discrepancies in the calculation of C L are remarkably small, but that the results for CDvary considerably. The accurate calculation of drag for most practical aerodynamic vehicles has been a challenge Table 6.1 Tabulation of the calculated values of lift and drag coefﬁcients for the Cranked-Arrow Wing Aerodynamics Project by various investigators.

Amazingly, in ourmodern world of high technology and advanced CFD techniques, accurate dragprediction remains a problem, although improvements are gradually being made.Accurate CFD predictions of drag are compromised by at least the following: 1.The calculation of skin friction drag requires the accurate calculation of shear stress, which requires an accurate calculation of the velocity gradient atthe surface [see for example Equation (1.59)], which requires a very ﬁne, closelyspaced computational grid adjacent to the wall to obtain very accurate valuesof the ﬂow velocity at the ﬁrst several gridpoints above the wall. The velocitygradient at the surface is then obtained from these velocities by using one-sideddifferencing. 2.The boundary layers on any practical-sized vehicle are turbulent, and any CFD calculation of this ﬂow must include this effect. Turbulence remains oneof the few unsolved problems in classical physics, so its effect must be modeled in aerodynamic calculations. Most CFD calculations of turbulent ﬂows use theReynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS), discussed in Part 4 of thisbook, and must incorporate some type of turbulence model. There are literallydozens of different turbulence models in existence, each one depending, in oneway or another, on empirical data. Turbulence models by themselves introducea great deal of uncertainty in the calculation of drag. The seven different CFDcalculations noted in Table 6.1 all used different turbulence models. 3.The calculation of locations on a body where the ﬂow separates is also uncer- tain. For CFD, the calculation of separated ﬂows can only be made with Navier-Stokes solutions; only in a few (but interesting) instances can a solution of theEuler equations yield a semblance of ﬂow separation. The nature and locationof ﬂow separation are different for laminar and turbulent ﬂows (see for examplethe discussion of the real ﬂow over a sphere in Section 6.6). The uncertainty inthe calculation of separated ﬂows, which is in part related to the uncertainty inturbulence modeling discussed earlier, is another reason for the discrepanciesin drag coefﬁcient as tabulated in Table 6.1. The high angle of attack ﬂows asso-ciated with these test cases for the F-16XL have large regions of complex ﬂowseparation. Considering these uncertainties, the discrepancy in the calculations of C Dlisted in Table 6.1, all told, are not bad. Further advances in algorithms and modeling will inevitably lead to even better results. Furthermore, because CLwas accu- rately calculated and the details of the ﬂow ﬁeld itself were accurately capturedby the CFD calculations, the investigators participating in the Cranked-ArrowWing Aerodynamics Project International (AWAPI) were moved to conclude(Reference 114): Although differences were observed in the comparison of results from 10 different CFD solvers with measurements, these solvers all functioned robustly on an ac-tual aircraft at ﬂight conditions, with sufﬁcient agreement among them to concludeCHAPTER 6Three-Dimensional Incompressible Flow 523 that the overall objectives of the CAWAPI endeavor have been achieved. In partic- ular, the status of CFD as a tool for understanding ﬂight-test observations has beenconﬁrmed. This is also an appropriate conclusion to end our discussion of airplane lift and drag. 6.8 SUMMARY For a three-dimensional (point) source, Vr=λ 4πr2(6.6) and φ=−λ 4πr(6.7) For a three-dimensional doublet, φ=−μ 4πcosθ r2(6.9) and V=μ 2πcosθ r3er+μ 4πsinθ r3eθ (6.10) The ﬂow over a sphere is generated by superimposing a three-dimensionaldoublet and a uniform ﬂow. The resulting surface velocity and pressure distri-butions are given by V θ=3 2V∞sinθ (6.19) and Cp=1−9 4sin2θ (6.20) In comparison with ﬂow over a cylinder, the surface velocity and magnitudeof the pressure coefﬁcient are smaller for the sphere—an example of the three-dimensional relieving effect. In modern aerodynamic applications, inviscid, incompressible ﬂows over com-plex three-dimensional bodies are usually computed via three-dimensionalpanel techniques.524 PART 2Inviscid, Incompressible Flow 6.9 PROBLEMS 6.1 Prove that three-dimensional source ﬂow is irrotational. 6.2 Prove that three-dimensional source ﬂow is a physically possible incompressible ﬂow. 6.3 A sphere and a circular cylinder (with its axis perpendicular to the ﬂow)are mounted in the same freestream. A pressure tap exists at the top of thesphere, and this is connected via a tube to one side of a manometer. Theother side of the manometer is connected to a pressure tap on the surfaceof the cylinder. This tap is located on the cylindrical surface such that nodeﬂection of the manometer ﬂuid takes place. Calculate the location ofthis tap.PART3 Inviscid, Compressible Flow In Part 3, we deal with high-speed ﬂows—subsonic, supersonic, and hyper- sonic. In such ﬂows, the density is a variable—this is compressible ﬂow. 525CHAPTER 7 Compressible Flow: Some Preliminary Aspects With the realization of aeroplane and missile speeds equal to or even surpassing many times the speed of sound, thermodynamics has entered the scene and willnever again leave our considerations. Jakob Ackeret, 1962 PREVIEW BOX With this chapter we move into the wild and exciting world of high-speed ﬂow. To jump into this world,however, we need some preparation. This chapter pre-pares us to deal with the high-speed subsonic, tran-sonic, supersonic, and hypersonic ﬂows that are dis-cussed in subsequent chapters. In the present chapter,we once again add to our inventory of fundamentalprinciples and relations—those necessary to under-stand and predict high-speed ﬂow. View this chapteras a continuation of Chapter 2 on some fundamen-tal principles and equations, but a continuation with aﬂair laced by high energy (ﬁguratively and literally). Energy? What do we mean? Consider that you are in an automobile traveling at 65 miles per hour alonga highway. If you stick your hand out the window (notrecommended by the way, for safety reasons) youwill sense a certain amount of energy in the airﬂow,and your hand will be forced back to some extent.Now imagine that you are traveling at 650 mi/h andyou stick your hand out the window (ﬁguratively).You can just imagine what tremendous energy youwould sense, and what disaster would happen to yourhand. The point is that high-speed ﬂow is high-energy ﬂow. The science of energy is thermodynamics. So this chapter is, for the most part, a discussion ofthermodynamics—but only to the extent necessaryfor our subsequent applications in high-speed ﬂow. High-speed ﬂow is also compressible ﬂow. With this chapter, we can no longer assume that the densityis constant. Rather, the density is a variable, which in-troduces some neat physics and analytical challengesfor our study of compressible ﬂow. Indeed, the worldwe are entering, beginning with this chapter, is quitedifferent than the incompressible world we dealt within Chapters 3 to 6. This is like a fresh start. So get onboard, and let’s start. 527528 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 7.1 INTRODUCTION On September 30, 1935, the leading aerodynamicists from all corners of the world converged on Rome, Italy. Some of them arrived in airplanes which, in those days,lumbered along at speeds of 130 mi/h. Ironically, these people were gathering todiscuss airplane aerodynamics not at 130 mi/h but rather at the unbelievable speedsof 500 mi/h and faster. By invitation only, such aerodynamic giants as Theodorevon Karman and Eastman Jacobs from the United States, Ludwig Prandtl andAdolf Busemann from Germany, Jakob Ackeret from Switzerland, G. I. Taylorfrom England, Arturo Crocco and Enrico Pistolesi from Italy, and others assem-bled for the ﬁfth V olta Conference, which had as its topic “High Velocities inAviation.” Although the jet engine had not yet been developed, these men wereconvinced that the future of aviation was “faster and higher.” At that time, someaeronautical engineers felt that airplanes would never ﬂy faster than the speedof sound—the myth of the “sound barrier” was propagating through the ranksof aviation. However, the people who attended the ﬁfth V olta Conference knewbetter. For 6 days, inside an impressive Renaissance building that served as thecity hall during the Holy Roman Empire, these individuals presented papers thatdiscussed ﬂight at high subsonic, supersonic, and even hypersonic speeds. Amongthese presentations was the ﬁrst public revelation of the concept of a swept wingfor high-speed ﬂight; Adolf Busemann, who originated the concept, discussed thetechnical reasons why swept wings would have less drag at high speeds than con-ventional straight wings. (One year later, the swept-wing concept was classiﬁedby the German Luftwaffe as a military secret. The Germans went on to producea large bulk of swept-wing research during World War II, resulting in the designof the ﬁrst operational jet airplane—the Me 262—which had a moderate degree ofsweep.) Many of the discussions at the V olta Conference centered on the effects of“compressibility” at high subsonic speeds, that is, the effects of variable density,because this was clearly going to be the ﬁrst problem to be encountered by futurehigh-speed airplanes. For example, Eastman Jacobs presented wind-tunnel test re-sults for compressibility effects on standard NACA four- and ﬁve-digit airfoils athigh subsonic speeds and noted extraordinarily large increases in drag beyond cer-tain freestream Mach numbers. In regard to supersonic ﬂows, Ludwig Prandtl pre-sented a series of photographs showing shock waves inside nozzles and on variousbodies—with some of the photographs dating as far back as 1907, when Prandtlstarted serious work in supersonic aerodynamics. (Clearly, Ludwig Prandtl wasbusy with much more than just the development of his incompressible airfoil andﬁnite-wing theory discussed in Chapters 4 and 5.) Jakob Ackeret gave a paperon the design of supersonic wind tunnels, which, under his direction, were beingestablished in Italy, Switzerland, and Germany. There were also presentations onpropulsion techniques for high-speed ﬂight, including rockets and ramjets. Theatmosphere surrounding the participants in the V olta Conference was exciting andheady; the conference launched the world aerodynamic community into the areaof high-speed subsonic and supersonic ﬂight—an area which today is as common-place as the 130-mi/h ﬂight speeds of 1935. Indeed, the purpose of the next eightchapters of this book is to present the fundamentals of such high-speed ﬂight.CHAPTER 7Compressible Flow: Some Preliminary Aspects 529 In contrast to the low-speed, incompressible ﬂows discussed in Chapters 3 to 6, the pivotal aspect of high-speed ﬂow is that the density is a variable. Such ﬂows are called compressible ﬂows and are the subject of Chapters 7 to 14. Return to Figure 1.45, which gives a block diagram categorizing types of aerodynamicﬂows. In Chapters 7 to 14, we discuss ﬂows which fall into blocks DandF; that is, we will deal with inviscid compressible ﬂow. In the process, we touch all the ﬂow regimes itemized in blocks Gthrough J. These ﬂow regimes are illustrated in Figure 1.44; study Figures 1.44 and 1.45 carefully, and review the surroundingdiscussion in Section 1.10 before proceeding further. In addition to variable density, another pivotal aspect of high-speed com- pressible ﬂow is energy. A high-speed ﬂow is a high-energy ﬂow. For example, consider the ﬂow of air at standard sea level conditions moving at twice the speedof sound. The internal energy of 1 kg of this air is 2.07 ×10 5J, whereas the kinetic energy is larger, namely, 2.31 ×105J. When the ﬂow velocity is decreased, some of this kinetic energy is lost and reappears as an increase in internal energy,hence increasing the temperature of the gas. Therefore, in a high-speed ﬂow, en-ergy transformations and temperature changes are important considerations. Suchconsiderations come under the science of thermodynamics. For this reason, ther- modynamics is a vital ingredient in the study of compressible ﬂow. One purposeof the present chapter is to review brieﬂy the particular aspects of thermodynamicswhich are essential to our subsequent discussions of compressible ﬂow. The road map for this chapter is given in Figure 7.1. As our discussion proceeds, refer to this road map in order to provide an orientation for our ideas. Figure 7.1 Road map for Chapter 7.530 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 7.2 A BRIEF REVIEW OF THERMODYNAMICS The importance of thermodynamics in the analysis and understanding of com- pressible ﬂow was underscored in Section 7.1. Hence, the purpose of the presentsection is to review those aspects of thermodynamics that are important to com-pressible ﬂows. This is in no way intended to be an exhaustive discussion ofthermodynamics; rather, it is a review of only those fundamental ideas and equa-tions that will be of direct use in subsequent chapters. If you have studied ther-modynamics, this review should serve as a ready reminder of some importantrelations. If you are not familiar with thermodynamics, this section is somewhatself-contained so as to give you a feeling for the fundamental ideas and equationsthat we use frequently in subsequent chapters. 7.2.1 Perfect Gas As described in Section 1.2, a gas is a collection of particles (molecules, atoms,ions, electrons, etc.) which are in more or less random motion. Due to the elec-tronic structure of these particles, a force ﬁeld pervades the space around them.The force ﬁeld due to one particle reaches out and interacts with neighboringparticles, and vice versa. Hence, these ﬁelds are called intermolecular forces. However, if the particles of the gas are far enough apart, the inﬂuence of the inter-molecular forces is small and can be neglected. A gas in which the intermolecularforces are neglected is deﬁned as a perfect gas. For a perfect gas, p,ρ, and Tare related through the following equation of state: p=ρRT (7.1) where Ris the speciﬁc gas constant, which is a different value for different gases. For air at standard conditions, R=287 J/(kg ·K)=1716 (ft ·lb)/(slug ·◦R). At the temperatures and pressures characteristic of many compressible ﬂow applications, the gas particles are, on the average, more than 10 molecular diame-ters apart; this is far enough to justify the assumption of a perfect gas. Therefore,throughout the remainder of this book, we use the equation of state in the formof Equation (7.1), or its counterpart, pv=RT (7.2) where vis the speciﬁc volume, that is, the volume per unit mass; v=1/ρ. (Please note: Starting with this chapter, we use the symbol vto denote both speciﬁc volume and the ycomponent of velocity. This usage is standard, and in all cases it should be obvious and cause no confusion.) 7.2.2 Internal Energy and Enthalpy Consider an individual molecule of a gas, say, an O 2molecule in air. This molecule is moving through space in a random fashion, occasionally colliding with aneighboring molecule. Because of its velocity through space, the molecule hasCHAPTER 7Compressible Flow: Some Preliminary Aspects 531 translational kinetic energy. In addition, the molecule is made up of individual atoms which we can visualize as connected to each other along various axes; forexample, we can visualize the O 2molecule as a “dumbbell” shape, with an O atom at each end of a connecting axis. In addition to its translational motion, sucha molecule can execute a rotational motion in space; the kinetic energy of thisrotation contributes to the net energy of the molecule. Also, the atoms of a givenmolecule can vibrate back and forth along and across the molecular axis, thuscontributing a potential and kinetic energy of vibration to the molecule. Finally,the motion of the electrons around each of the nuclei of the molecule contributesan “electronic” energy to the molecule. Hence, the energy of a given molecule isthe sum of its translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic energies. Now consider a ﬁnite volume of gas consisting of a large number of molecules. The sum of the energies of all the molecules in this volume is deﬁned as theinternal energy of the gas. The internal energy per unit mass of gas is deﬁned as the speciﬁc internal energy, denoted by e. A related quantity is the speciﬁc enthalpy, denoted by hand deﬁned as h=e+pv (7.3) For a perfect gas, both eandhare functions of temperature only: e=e(T) (7.4a) h=h(T) (7.4b) Letdeanddhrepresent differentials of eandh, respectively. Then, for a perfect gas, de=c vdT (7.5a) dh=cpdT (7.5b) where cvandcpare the speciﬁc heats at constant volume and constant pressure, respectively. In Equations (7.5 aandb),cvandcpcan themselves be functions ofT. However, for moderate temperatures (for air, for T<1000 K), the speciﬁc heats are reasonably constant. A perfect gas where cvandcpare constants is deﬁned as a calorically perfect gas, for which Equations (7.5 aandb) become (7.6a) e=cvT h=cpT (7.6b) For a large number of practical compressible ﬂow problems, the temperatures are moderate. For this reason, in this book we always treat the gas as caloricallyperfect; that is, we assume that the speciﬁc heats are constant. For a discussion ofcompressible ﬂow problems where the speciﬁc heats are not constant (such as thehigh-temperature chemically reacting ﬂow over a high-speed atmospheric entryvehicle, that is, the space shuttle), see Reference 21. Note that eandhin Equations (7.3) through (7.6) are thermodynamic state variables—they depend only on the state of the gas and are independent of any532 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow process. Although cvandcpappear in these equations, there is no restriction to just a constant volume or a constant pressure process. Rather, Equations (7.5 a andb) and (7.6 aandb) are relations for thermodynamic state variables, namely, eandhas functions of T,and have nothing to do with the process that may be taking place. For a speciﬁc gas, cpandcvare related through the equation cp−cv=R (7.7) Dividing Equation (7.7) by cp, we obtain 1−cv cp=R cp(7.8) Deﬁne γ≡cp/cv. For air at standard conditions, γ=1.4. Then Equation (7.8) becomes 1−1 γ=R cp or cp=γR γ−1(7.9) Similarly, dividing Equation (7.7) by cv, we obtain cv=R γ−1(7.10) Equations (7.9) and (7.10) are particularly useful in our subsequent discussion of compressible ﬂow. EXAMPLE 7.1 Consider a room with a rectangular ﬂoor that is 5 m by 7 m, and a 3.3 m high ceiling. The air pressure and temperature in the room are 1 atm and 25◦C, respectively. Calculate the internal energy and the enthalpy of the air in the room. ■Solution We ﬁrst need to calculate the mass of air in the room. From Equation (7.1) ρ=p RT where each quantity must be expressed in consistent SI units. Since 1 atm =1.01× 105N/m2and 0◦C is 273 K, we have p=1.01×105N/m2and T=273+25=298 K Hence, ρ=p RT=1.01×105 (287)(298)=1.181 kg/m3CHAPTER 7Compressible Flow: Some Preliminary Aspects 533 The volume of the room is (5)(7)(3.3) =115.5m3. The mass of air in the room is therefore M=(1.181)(115.5) =136.4 kg From Equation (7.6a), the internal energy per unit mass is e=cvT where cv=R γ−1=(287) 1.4−1=287 0.4=717.5 joule/(kg ·K) Thus, e=cvT=(717.5)(298) =2.138×105joule/kg The internal energy in the room, E, is then E=Me=(136.4)(2.138 ×105)=2.92×107joule From Equation (7.6b ), the enthalpy per unit mass is h=cpT where cp=γR γ−1=(1.4)(287) 0.4=1004.5 joule/(kg ·K) Thus, h=cpT=(1004.5)(298) =2.993×105joule/kg The enthalpy in the room, H, is then H=Mh=(136.4)(2.993 ×105)=4.08×107joule A check on two answers can be made knowing that h e=cpT cvT=cp cv=γ=1.4 From the answers, H E=4.08×107 2.92×107=1.4 It checks. This simple example is intended to reinforce two basic points. 1.Consistent units must be used when making a calculation using basic equations from physics, such as Equations (7.1), (7.6a), and (7.6b). Here we used SI units, because the given information was given in terms of meters and degrees Celsius, which isreadily put in terms of the consistent unit of temperature, degrees Kelvin. 2.The internal energy and enthalpy per unit mass were calculated directly from thetemperature of the gas, using Equations (7 .6aandb). There was no need to consider a “constant volume process” or a “constant pressure process”; there is no process atall to consider here. Internal energy and enthalpy per unit mass, eandh, are simply534 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow state variables, depending only on the thermodynamic state of the system. Even though Equation (7.6a)contains cv, a constant volume process is not relevant here. Similarly, even though Equation (7.6b)contains cp, a constant pressure process is not relevant here. EXAMPLE 7.2 One type of supersonic wind tunnel is a blow-down tunnel, where air is stored in ahigh-pressure reservoir, and then, upon the opening of a valve, exhausted through thetunnel into a vacuum tank or simply into the open atmosphere at the downstream end ofthe tunnel. Supersonic wind tunnels are discussed in Chapter 10. For this example, weconsider just the high-pressure reservoir as a storage tank that is being charged with air bya high-pressure pump. As air is being pumped into the constant-volume reservoir, the airpressure inside the reservoir increases. The pump continues to charge the reservoir untilthe desired pressure is achieved. Consider a reservoir with an internal volume of 30 m As air is pumped into the reservoir, the air pressure inside the reservoir continually increases with time. Considerthe instant during the charging process when the reservoir pressure is 10 atm. Assume theair temperature inside the reservoir is held constant at 300 K by means of a heat exchanger.Air is pumped into the reservoir at the rate of 1 kg/s. Calculate the time rate of increaseof pressure in the reservoir at this instant. ■Solution LetMbe the total mass of air inside the reservoir at any instant. Since air is being pumped into the reservoir at the rate of 1 kg/s, then the total mass of air is increasing at the rate ofdM/dt=1 kg/s. The density of the air at any instant is ρ=M V(E.7.1) where Vis the total volume of the reservoir and is constant; V=30 m3. Since Vis constant, from Equation (E.7.1) dρ dt=1 VdM dt=1 kg/s 30 m3=0.0333 Differentiating Equation (7.1) with respect to time, and recalling that RandTare constant, dp dt=RTdρ dt(E.7.2) dp dt=(287)(300)(0.0333) =2867.13N m2s EXAMPLE 7.3 In Example 7.2, if the pumping rate of 1 kg/s were maintained constant throughout thecharging process, how long will it take to increase the reservoir pressure from 10 to20 atm?CHAPTER 7Compressible Flow: Some Preliminary Aspects 535 ■Solution If the pumping rate is held constant at 1 kg/s, then the time rate of change of density, dρ/dt=0.0333 kg/m3s will remain constant, and consequently the time rate of change of pressure, dp/dt=2867.13 N/m2s, will remain constant. Hence, the time required to increase the reservoir pressure from 10 atm to 20 atm is /parenleftbig 20 atm −10 atm/parenrightbig/parenleftbig 1.01×105/parenrightbig 2867.13=352.27 s or, in minutes, 352.27 60=5.87 min 7.2.3 First Law of Thermodynamics Consider a ﬁxed mass of gas, which we deﬁne as the system. (For simplicity, assume a unit mass, for example, 1 kg or 1 slug.) The region outside the system is called the surroundings. The interface between the system and its surroundings is called the boundary, as shown in Figure 7.2. Assume that the system is stationary. Letδqbe an incremental amount of heat added to the system across the boundary, as sketched in Figure 7.2. Examples of the source of δqare radiation from the surroundings that is absorbed by the mass in the system and thermal conductiondue to temperature gradients across the boundary. Also, let δwdenote the work done on the system by the surroundings (say, by a displacement of the boundary,squeezing the volume of the system to a smaller value). As discussed earlier,due to the molecular motion of the gas, the system has an internal energy e. The heat added and work done on the system cause a change in energy, and since thesystem is stationary, this change in energy is simply de: δq+δw=de (7.11) This is the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics: It is an empirical result conﬁrmed by experience. In Equation (7.11), eis a state variable. Hence, deis an exact Figure 7.2 Thermodynamic system.536 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow differential, and its value depends only on the initial and ﬁnal states of the sys- tem. In contrast, δqandδwdepend on the process in going from the initial to the ﬁnal states. For a given de, there are in general an inﬁnite number of different ways (processes) by which heat can be added and work done on the system. We areprimarily concerned with three types of processes: 1.Adiabatic process. One in which no heat is added to or taken away from the system 2.Reversible process. One in which no dissipative phenomena occur, that is, where the effects of viscosity, thermal conductivity, and mass diffusion are absent 3.Isentropic process. One that is both adiabatic and reversible For a reversible process, it can be easily shown that δw=− pdv, where dv is an incremental change in the volume due to a displacement of the boundary ofthe system. Thus, Equation (7.11) becomes δq−pdv=de (7.12) 7.2.4 Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics Consider a block of ice in contact with a red-hot plate of steel. Experience tells usthat the ice will warm up (and probably melt) and the steel plate will cool down.However, Equation (7.11) does not necessarily say this will happen. Indeed, theﬁrst law allows that the ice may get cooler and the steel plate hotter—just as longas energy is conserved during the process. Obviously, in real life this does nothappen; instead, nature imposes another condition on the process, a conditionthat tells us which direction a process will take. To ascertain the proper direction of a process, let us deﬁne a new state variable, the entropy, as follows: ds=δq rev T(7.13) where sis the entropy of the system, δqrevis an incremental amount of heat added reversibly to the system, and Tis the system temperature. Do not be confused by the above deﬁnition. It deﬁnes a change in entropy in terms of a reversibleaddition of heat δq rev. However, entropy is a state variable, and it can be used in conjunction with any type of process, reversible or irreversible. The quantityδq revin Equation (7.13) is just an artiﬁce; an effective value of δqrevcan always be assigned to relate the initial and end points of an irreversible process, wherethe actual amount of heat added is δq. Indeed, an alternative and probably more lucid relation is ds=δq T+dsirrev (7.14) In Equation (7.14), δqis the actual amount of heat added to the system during an actual irreversible process, and dsirrevis the generation of entropy due toCHAPTER 7Compressible Flow: Some Preliminary Aspects 537 the irreversible, dissipative phenomena of viscosity, thermal conductivity, and mass diffusion occurring within the system. These dissipative phenomena always increase the entropy: dsirrev≥0 (7.15) In Equation (7.15), the equals sign denotes a reversible process, where by def-inition no dissipative phenomena occur within the system. Combining Equa-tions (7.14) and (7.15), we have ds≥δq T(7.16) Furthermore, if the process is adiabatic, δq=0, and Equation (7.16) becomes ds≥0 (7.17) Equations (7.16) and (7.17) are forms of the second law of thermodynamics. The second law tells us in what direction a process will take place. A process will pro-ceed in a direction such that the entropy of the system plus that of its surroundingsalways increases or, at best, stays the same. In our example of the ice in contactwith hot steel, consider the system to be both the ice and steel plate combined.The simultaneous heating of the ice and cooling of the plate yield a net increase inentropy for the system. On the other hand, the impossible situation of the ice get-ting cooler and the plate hotter would yield a net decrease in entropy, a situationforbidden by the second law. In summary, the concept of entropy in combinationwith the second law allows us to predict the direction that nature takes. The practical calculation of entropy is carried out as follows. In Equa- tion (7.12), assume that heat is added reversibly; then the deﬁnition of entropy,Equation (7.13), substituted in Equation (7.12) yields T ds−pdv=de or T ds=de+pdv (7.18) From the deﬁnition of enthalpy, Equation (7.3), we have dh=de+pdv+vdp (7.19) Combining Equations (7.18) and (7.19), we obtain T ds=dh−vdp (7.20) Equations (7.18) and (7.20) are important; they are essentially alternate forms ofthe ﬁrst law expressed in terms of entropy. For a perfect gas, recall Equations (7.5 a andb), namely, de=c vdTanddh=cpdT. Substituting these relations into538 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Equations (7.18) and (7.20), we obtain ds=cvdT T+pdv T(7.21) and ds=cpdT T−vdp T(7.22) Working with Equation (7.22), substitute the equation of state pv=RT, or v/T=R/p, into the last term: ds=cpdT T−Rdp p(7.23) Consider a thermodynamic process with initial and end states denoted by 1 and 2, respectively. Equation (7.23), integrated between states 1 and 2, becomes s2−s1=/integraldisplayT2 T1cpdT T−/integraldisplayp2 p1Rdp p(7.24) For a calorically perfect gas, both Randcpare constants; hence, Equation (7.24) becomes s2−s1=cplnT2 T1−Rlnp2 p1(7.25) In a similar fashion, Equation (7.21) leads to s2−s1=cvlnT2 T1+Rlnv2 v1(7.26) Equations (7.25) and (7.26) are practical expressions for the calculation of theentropy change of a calorically perfect gas between two states. Note from theseequations that sis a function of two thermodynamic variables, for example, s=s(p,T),s=s(v,T). 7.2.5 Isentropic Relations We have deﬁned an isentropic process as one which is both adiabatic and re-versible. Consider Equation (7.14). For an adiabatic process, δq=0. Also, for a reversible process, ds irrev=0. Thus, for an adiabatic, reversible process, Equa- tion (7.14) yields ds=0, or entropy is constant; hence, the word “isentropic.” For such an isentropic process, Equation (7.25) is written as 0=cplnT2 T1−Rlnp2 p1 lnp2 p1=cp RlnT2 T1 orp2 p1=/parenleftbiggT2 T1/parenrightbiggcp/R (7.27)CHAPTER 7Compressible Flow: Some Preliminary Aspects 539 However, from Equation (7.9), cp R=γ γ−1 and hence Equation (7.27) is written as p2 p1=/parenleftbiggT2 T1/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) (7.28) In a similar fashion, Equation (7.26) written for an isentropic process gives 0=cvlnT2 T1+Rlnv2 v1 lnv2 v1=−cv RlnT2 T1 v2 v1=/parenleftbiggT2 T1/parenrightbigg−cv/R (7.29) From Equation (7.10), cv R=1 γ−1 and hence Equation (7.29) is written as v2 v1=/parenleftbiggT2 T1/parenrightbigg−1/(γ −1) (7.30) Sinceρ2/ρ1=v1/v2, Equation (7.30) becomes ρ2 ρ1=/parenleftbiggT2 T1/parenrightbigg1/(γ−1) (7.31) Combining Equations (7.28) and (7.31), we can summarize the isentropic rela- tions as p2 p1=/parenleftbiggρ2 ρ1/parenrightbiggγ =/parenleftbiggT2 T1/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) (7.32) Equation (7.32) is very important; it relates pressure, density, and temperature foran isentropic process. We use this equation frequently, so make certain to brandit on your mind. Also, keep in mind the source of Equation (7.32); it stems fromthe ﬁrst law and the deﬁnition of entropy. Therefore, Equation (7.32) is basicallyan energy relation for an isentropic process. Why is Equation (7.32) so important? Why is it frequently used? Why are we so interested in an isentropic process when it seems so restrictive—requiring bothadiabatic and reversible conditions? The answers rest on the fact that a large num-ber of practical compressible ﬂow problems can be assumed to be isentropic—contrary to what you might initially think. For example, consider the ﬂow overan airfoil or through a rocket engine. In the regions adjacent to the airfoil surface540 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow and the rocket nozzle walls, a boundary layer is formed wherein the dissipative mechanisms of viscosity, thermal conduction, and diffusion are strong. Hence,the entropy increases within these boundary layers. However, consider the ﬂuidelements moving outside the boundary layer. Here, the dissipative effects of vis-cosity, etc., are very small and can be neglected. Moreover, no heat is being trans-ferred to or from the ﬂuid element (i.e., we are not heating the ﬂuid element with aBunsen burner or cooling it in a refrigerator); thus, the ﬂow outside the boundarylayer is adiabatic. Consequently, the ﬂuid elements outside the boundary layer areexperiencing an adiabatic reversible process—namely, isentropic ﬂow. In the vastmajority of practical applications, the viscous boundary layer adjacent to the sur-face is thin compared with the entire ﬂow ﬁeld, and hence large regions of theﬂow can be assumed isentropic. This is why a study of isentropic ﬂow is directlyapplicable to many types of practical compressible ﬂow problems. In turn, Equa-tion (7.32) is a powerful relation for such ﬂows, valid for a calorically perfect gas. This ends our brief review of thermodynamics. Its purpose has been to give a quick summary of ideas and equations that will be employed throughout oursubsequent discussions of compressible ﬂow. Indeed, this author knows of nopractical problem dealing with compressible ﬂow that can be solved without in-voking some aspect of thermodynamics—it is that important. For a more thoroughdiscussion of the power and beauty of thermodynamics, see any good thermody-namics text, such as References 22 to 24. EXAMPLE 7.4 Consider a Boeing 747 ﬂying at a standard altitude of 36,000 ft. The pressure at a point on the wing is 400 lb/ft2. Assuming isentropic ﬂow over the wing, calculate the temperature at this point. ■Solution From Appendix E, at a standard altitude of 36,000 ft, p∞=476 lb/ft2andT∞=391◦R. From Equation (7.32), p p∞=/parenleftbiggT T∞/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) or T=T∞/parenleftbiggp p∞/parenrightbigg(γ−1)/γ =391/parenleftbigg400 476/parenrightbigg0.4/1.4 =372◦R EXAMPLE 7.5 Consider the gas in the reservoir of the supersonic wind tunnel discussed in Examples 7.2and 7.3. The pressure and temperature of the air in the reservoir are 20 atm and 300 K,respectively. The air in the reservoir expands through the wind tunnel duct. At a certainlocation in the duct, the pressure is 1 atm. Calculate the air temperature at this locationif: (a) the expansion is isentropic and (b) the expansion is nonisentropic with an entropyincrease through the duct to this location of 320 J/(kg ·K).CHAPTER 7Compressible Flow: Some Preliminary Aspects 541 ■Solution (a) From Equation (7.32), p2 p1=/parenleftbiggT2 T1/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) or, T2=T1/parenleftbiggp2 p1/parenrightbiggγ−1 γ =300/parenleftbigg1 20/parenrightbigg0.4 1.4 =300(0.05)0.2857 =300(0.4249) =127.5K (b) From Equation (7.25), s2−s1=cplnT2 T1−Rlnp2 p1 Using Equation (7.9) to obtain the value of cp, cp=γR γ−1=(1.4)(287) 0.4=1004.5J kg·K we have from Equation (7.25), 320=1004.5 ln/parenleftbiggT2 300/parenrightbigg −(287) ln/parenleftbigg1 20/parenrightbigg =1004.5 ln/parenleftbiggT2 300/parenrightbigg −(−859.78) Thus, ln/parenleftbiggT2 300/parenrightbigg =320−859.78 1004.5=−0.5374 T2 300=e−0.5374=0.5843 T2=(0.5843)(300) =175.3K Comment: Comparing the results from parts (a) and (b), note that the entropy increase results in a higher temperature at the point in the expansion where p=1 atm compared to that for the isentropic expansion. This makes sense. From Equation (7.25) we see that entropy is a function of both temperature and pressure, increasing with an increasein temperature and decreasing with an increase in pressure. In this example, the ﬁnalpressure for both cases (a) and (b) is the same, but the entropy for case (b) is higher.Thus, from Equation (7.25), we see that the ﬁnal temperature for case (b) must be higherthan that for case (a). On a more qualitative basis, the physical mechanisms that couldproduce the change in entropy would be viscous dissipation (friction), the presence ofshock waves in the duct, or heat addition from the surroundings through the walls of theduct. Intuitively, all these irreversible mechanisms would result in a higher gas temperaturethan the isentropic expansion that, by deﬁnition, assumes an adiabatic and reversible (nofriction) expansion.542 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 7.3 Deﬁnition of compressibility. 7.3 DEFINITION OF COMPRESSIBILITY All real substances are compressible to some greater or lesser extent; that is, when you squeeze or press on them, their density will change. This is particularly true ofgases, much less so for liquids, and virtually unnoticeable for solids. The amountby which a substance can be compressed is given by a speciﬁc property of thesubstance called the compressibility, deﬁned below. Consider a small element of ﬂuid of volume v, as sketched in Figure 7.3. The pressure exerted on the sides of the element is p. Assume the pressure is now increased by an inﬁnitesimal amount dp. The volume of the element will change by a corresponding amount dv; here, the volume will decrease; hence, dvshown in Figure 7.3 is a negative quantity. By deﬁnition, the compressibility τof the ﬂuid is τ=−1 vdv dp(7.33) Physically, the compressibility is the fractional change in volume of the ﬂuidelement per unit change in pressure. However, Equation (7.33) is not preciseenough. We know from experience that when a gas is compressed (say, in abicycle pump), its temperature tends to increase, depending on the amount ofheat transferred into or out of the gas through the boundaries of the system. Ifthe temperature of the ﬂuid element in Figure 7.3 is held constant (due to someheat transfer mechanism), then τis identiﬁed as the isothermal compressibility τ T, deﬁned from Equation (7.33) as τT=−1 v/parenleftbigg∂v ∂p/parenrightbigg T(7.34) On the other hand, if no heat is added to or taken away from the ﬂuid element,and if friction is ignored, the compression of the ﬂuid element takes place isen-tropically, and τis identiﬁed as the isentropic compressibility τ s, deﬁned from Equation (7.33) as τs=−1 v/parenleftbigg∂v ∂p/parenrightbigg s(7.35) where the subscript sdenotes that the partial derivative is taken at constant entropy. BothτTandτsare precise thermodynamic properties of the ﬂuid; their values forCHAPTER 7Compressible Flow: Some Preliminary Aspects 543 different gases and liquids can be obtained from various handbooks of physical properties. In general, the compressibility of gases is several orders of magnitudelarger than that of liquids. The role of the compressibility τin determining the properties of a ﬂuid in motion is seen as follows. Deﬁne vas the speciﬁc volume (i.e., the volume per unit mass). Hence, v=1/ρ. Substituting this deﬁnition into Equation (7.33), we obtain τ=1 ρdρ dp(7.36) Thus, whenever the ﬂuid experiences a change in pressure dp, the corresponding change in density dρfrom Equation (7.36) is dρ=ρτdp (7.37) Consider a ﬂuid ﬂow, say, for example, the ﬂow over an airfoil. If the ﬂuid is aliquid, where the compressibility τis very small, then for a given pressure change dpfrom one point to another in the ﬂow, Equation (7.37) states that dρwill be negligibly small. In turn, we can reasonably assume that ρis constant and that the ﬂow of a liquid is incompressible. On the other hand, if the ﬂuid is a gas, where the compressibility τis large, then for a given pressure change dpfrom one point to another in the ﬂow, Equation (7.37) states that dρcan be large. Thus, ρis notconstant, and in general, the ﬂow of a gas is a compressible ﬂow. The exception to this is the low-speed ﬂow of a gas; in such ﬂows, the actual magnitude of the pressure changes throughout the ﬂow ﬁeld is small compared with the pressureitself. Thus, for a low-speed ﬂow, dpin Equation (7.37) is small, and even though τis large, the value of dρcan be dominated by the small dp. In such cases, ρcan be assumed to be constant, hence allowing us to analyze low-speed gas ﬂows asincompressible ﬂows (such as discussed in Chapters 3 to 6). Later, we demonstrate that the most convenient index to gage whether a gas ﬂow can be considered incompressible, or whether it must be treated ascompressible, is the Mach number M, deﬁned in Chapter 1 as the ratio of local ﬂow velocity Vto the local speed of sound a: M≡V a(7.38) We show that, when M>0.3, the ﬂow should be considered compressible. Also, we show that the speed of sound in a gas is related to the isentropic compressibilityτ s, given by Equation (7.35). 7.4 GOVERNING EQUATIONS FOR INVISCID, COMPRESSIBLE FLOW In Chapters 3 to 6, we studied inviscid, incompressible ﬂow; recall that the pri-mary dependent variables for such ﬂows are pandV, and hence we need only two basic equations, namely, the continuity and momentum equations, to solve forthese two unknowns. Indeed, the basic equations are combined to obtain Laplace’s544 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow equation and Bernoulli’s equation, which are the primary tools used for the ap- plications discussed in Chapters 3 to 6. Note that both ρandTare assumed to be constant throughout such inviscid, incompressible ﬂows. As a result, no additionalgoverning equations are required; in particular, there is no need for the energyequation or energy concepts in general. Basically, incompressible ﬂow obeyspurely mechanical laws and does not require thermodynamic considerations. In contrast, for compressible ﬂow, ρis variable and becomes an unknown. Hence, we need an additional governing equation—the energy equation—whichin turn introduces internal energy eas an unknown. Since eis related to temperature, then Talso becomes an important variable. Therefore, the primary dependent variables for the study of compressible ﬂow are p,V,ρ,e, and T; to solve for these ﬁve variables, we need ﬁve governing equations. Let us examinethis situation further. To begin with, the ﬂow of a compressible ﬂuid is governed by the basic equations derived in Chapter 2. At this point in our discussion, it is most importantfor you to be familiar with these equations as well as their derivation. Therefore,before proceeding further, return to Chapter 2 and carefully review the basic ideasand relations contained therein. This is a serious study tip, and if you follow it, thematerial in our next seven chapters will ﬂow much easier for you. In particular,review the integral and differential forms of the continuity equation (Section 2.4),the momentum equation (Section 2.5), and the energy equation (Section 2.7);indeed, pay particular attention to the energy equation because this is an importantaspect which sets compressible ﬂow apart from incompressible ﬂow. For convenience, some of the more important forms of the governing equa- tions for an inviscid, compressible ﬂow from Chapter 2 are repeated below: Continuity: From Equation (2.48), ∂ ∂t......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay VρdV+................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SρV·dS=0 (7.39) From Equation (2.52), ∂ρ ∂t+∇ ·ρV=0 (7.40) Momentum: From Equation (2.64), ∂ ∂t......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay VρVdV+................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)V=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SpdS+......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay VρfdV (7.41) From Equations (2.113 atoc), ρDu Dt=−∂p ∂x+ρfx (7.42a) ρDv Dt=−∂p ∂y+ρfy (7.42b) ρDw Dt=−∂p ∂z+ρfz (7.42c)CHAPTER 7Compressible Flow: Some Preliminary Aspects 545 Energy: From Equation (2.95), ∂ ∂t......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Vρ/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg dV+................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Sρ/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg V·dS =......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay V˙qρdV−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SpV·dS+......................................................................................................................................../integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Vρ(f·V)dV (7.43) From Equation (2.114), ρD(e+V2/2) Dt=ρ˙q−∇ ·pV+ρ(f·V) (7.44) The above continuity, momentum, and energy equations are three equations in terms of the ﬁve unknowns p,V,ρ,T, and e. Assuming a calorically perfect gas, the additional two equations needed to complete the system are obtained fromSection 7.2: Equation of state: p=ρRT (7.1) Internal energy: e=c vT (7.6a) In regard to the basic equations for compressible ﬂow, please note that Bernoulli’s equation as derived in Section 3.2 and given by Equation (3.13) doesnothold for compressible ﬂow; it clearly contains the assumption of constant density, and hence is invalid for compressible ﬂow. This warning is necessarybecause experience shows that a certain number of students of aerodynamics,apparently attracted by the simplicity of Bernoulli’s equation, attempt to use itfor all situations, compressible as well as incompressible. Do not do it! Alwaysremember that Bernoulli’s equation in the form of Equation (3.13) holds for in-compressible ﬂow only, and we must dismiss it from our thinking when dealingwith compressible ﬂow. As a ﬁnal note, we use both the integral and differential forms of the above equations in our subsequent discussions. Make certain that you feel comfortablewith these equations before proceeding further. 7.5 DEFINITION OF TOTAL (STAGNATION) CONDITIONS At the beginning of Section 3.4, the concept of static pressure pwas discussed in some detail. Static pressure is a measure of the purely random motion ofmolecules in a gas; it is the pressure you feel when you ride along with the gas atthe local ﬂow velocity. In contrast, the total (or stagnation) pressure was deﬁnedin Section 3.4 as the pressure existing at a point (or points) in the ﬂow whereV=0. Let us now deﬁne the concept of total conditions more precisely. Consider a ﬂuid element passing through a given point in a ﬂow where the lo- cal pressure, temperature, density, Mach number, and velocity are p,T,ρ,M, and V, respectively. Here, p,T, andρare static quantities (i.e., static pressure, static546 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow temperature, and static density, respectively); they are the pressure, temperature, and density you feel when you ride along with the gas at the local ﬂow velocity.Now imagine that you grab hold of the ﬂuid element and adiabatically slow it down to zero velocity. Clearly, you would expect (correctly) that the values of p, T, andρwould change as the ﬂuid element is brought to rest. In particular, the value of the temperature of the ﬂuid element after it has been brought to rest adi-abatically is deﬁned as the total temperature, denoted by T The corresponding value of enthalpy is deﬁned as the total enthalpy h 0, where h0=cpT0for a calor- ically perfect gas. Keep in mind that we do not actually have to bring the ﬂow to rest in real life in order to talk about the total temperature or total enthalpy;rather, they are deﬁned quantities that would exist at a point in a ﬂow if(in our imagination) the ﬂuid element passing through that point were brought to rest adi-abatically. Therefore, at a given point in a ﬂow, where the static temperature andenthalpy are Tandh, respectively, we can also assign a value of total temperature T 0and a value of total enthalpy h0deﬁned as above. The energy equation, Equation (7.44), provides some important information about total enthalpy and hence total temperature, as follows. Assume that the ﬂowis adiabatic (˙q=0), and that body forces are negligible (f=0). For such a ﬂow, Equation (7.44) becomes ρD(e+V 2/2) Dt= −∇ ·pV (7.45) Expand the right-hand side of Equation (7.45) using the following vector identity: ∇·pV≡p∇·V+V·∇p (7.46) Also, note that the substantial derivative deﬁned in Section 2.9 follows the normallaws of differentiation; for example, ρD(p/ρ) Dt=ρρDp/Dt−pDρ/Dt ρ2=Dp Dt−p ρDρ Dt(7.47) Recall the form of the continuity equation given by Equation (2.108): Dρ Dt+ρ∇·V=0 (2.108) Substituting Equation (2.108) into (7.47), we obtain ρD(p/ρ) Dt=Dp Dt+p∇·V=∂p ∂t+V·∇p+p∇·V (7.48) Substituting Equation (7.46) into (7.45), and adding Equation (7.48) to the result,we obtain ρD Dt/parenleftbigg e+p ρ+V2 2/parenrightbigg =− p∇·V−V·∇p+∂p ∂t+V·∇p+p∇·V(7.49) Note that e+p ρ=e+pv≡h (7.50)CHAPTER 7Compressible Flow: Some Preliminary Aspects 547 Substituting Equation (7.50) into (7.49), and noting that some of the terms on the right-hand side of Equation (7.49) cancel each other, we have ρD(h+V2/2) Dt=∂p ∂t(7.51) If the ﬂow is steady, ∂p/∂t=0, and Equation (7.51) becomes ρD(h+V2/2) Dt=0 (7.52) From the deﬁnition of the substantial derivative given in Section 2.9, Equa-tion (7.52) states that the time rate of change of h+V 2/2 following a moving ﬂuid element is zero; that is, h+V2 2=const (7.53) along a streamline. Recall that the assumptions which led to Equation (7.53) arethat the ﬂow is steady, adiabatic, and inviscid. In particular, since Equation (7.53)holds for an adiabatic ﬂow, it can be used to elaborate on our previous deﬁnitionof total enthalpy. Since h 0is deﬁned as that enthalpy that would exist at a point if the ﬂuid element were brought to rest adiabatically, we ﬁnd from Equation (7.53)with V=0 and hence h=h 0that the value of the constant in Equation (7.53) is h0. Hence, Equation (7.53) can be written as h+V2 2=h0 (7.54) Equation (7.54) is important; it states that at any point in a ﬂow, the total enthalpyis given by the sum of the static enthalpy plus the kinetic energy, all per unit mass.Whenever we have the combination h+V 2/2 in any subsequent equations, it can be identically replaced by h0. For example, Equation (7.52), which was derived for a steady, adiabatic, inviscid ﬂow, states that ρDh 0 Dt=0 that is, the total enthalpy is constant along a streamline. Moreover, if all thestreamlines of the ﬂow originate from a common uniform freestream (as is usuallythe case), then h 0is the same for each streamline. Consequently, we have for such a steady, adiabatic ﬂow that h0=const (7.55) throughout the entire ﬂow, and h0is equal to its freestream value. Equation (7.55), although simple in form, is a powerful tool. For steady, inviscid, adiabatic ﬂow,Equation (7.55) is a statement of the energy equation, and hence it can be used inplace of the more complex partial differential equation given by Equation (7.52). This is a great simpliﬁcation, as we will see in subsequent discussions.548 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow For a calorically perfect gas, h0=cpT0. Thus, the above results also state that the total temperature is constant throughout the steady, inviscid, adiabatic ﬂow of a calorically perfect gas; that is, T0=const (7.56) For such a ﬂow, Equation (7.56) can be used as a form of the governing energyequation. Keep in mind that the above discussion marbled two trains of thought: On the one hand, we dealt with the general concept of an adiabatic ﬂow ﬁeld [whichled to Equations (7.51) to (7.53)], and on the other hand, we dealt with thedeﬁnition of total enthalpy [which led to Equation (7.54)]. These two trains ofthought are really separate and should not be confused. Consider, for example, ageneral nonadiabatic ﬂow, such as a viscous boundary layer with heat transfer. A generic nonadiabatic ﬂow is sketched in Figure 7.4a. Clearly, Equations (7.51)to (7.53) do not hold for such a ﬂow. However, Equation (7.54) holds locally ateach point in the ﬂow, because the assumption of an adiabatic ﬂow contained inEquation (7.54) is made through the deﬁnition ofh 0and has nothing to do with the general overall ﬂow ﬁeld. For example, consider two different points, 1 and 2,in the general ﬂow, as shown in Figure 7.4a. At point 1, the local static enthalpyand velocity are h 1andV1, respectively. Hence, the local total enthalpy at point 1 ish0,1=h1+V2 1/2. At point 2, the local static enthalpy and velocity are h2and V2, respectively. Hence, the local total enthalpy at point 2 is h0,2=h2+V2 2/2. If the ﬂow between points 1 and 2 is nonadiabatic, then h0,1/negationslash=h0,2. Only for the special case where the ﬂow is adiabatic between the two points would h0,1=h0,2. This case is illustrated in Figure 7.4b. Of course, this is the special case treatedby Equations (7.55) and (7.56). Return to the beginning of this section, where we considered a ﬂuid element passing through a point in a ﬂow where the local properties are p,T,ρ,M, and V. Once again, imagine that you grab hold of the ﬂuid element and slow it down tozero velocity, but this time, let us slow it down both adiabatically andreversibly. That is, let us slow the ﬂuid element down to zero velocity isentropically. When the ﬂuid element is brought to rest isentropically, the resulting pressure and densityare deﬁned as the total pressure p 0andtotal density ρ0. (Since an isentropic process is also adiabatic, the resulting temperature is the same total temperature T0as discussed earlier.) As before, keep in mind that we do not have to actually bring the ﬂow to rest in real life in order to talk about total pressure and totaldensity; rather, they are deﬁned quantities that would exist at a point in a ﬂow if (in our imagination) the ﬂuid element passing through that point were brought torest isentropically. Therefore, at a given point in a ﬂow, where the static pressureand static density are pandρ, respectively, we can also assign a value of total pressure p 0, and total density ρ0deﬁned as above. The deﬁnition of p0andρ0deals with an isentropic compression to zero velocity. Keep in mind that the isentropic assumption is involved with the deﬁ-nition only. The concept of total pressure and density can be applied throughoutany general nonisentropic ﬂow. For example, consider two different points, 1 andCHAPTER 7Compressible Flow: Some Preliminary Aspects 549 Nonadiabatic flow 1 2h1, h0,1 h0, 2 ≠ h0,1 T0, 2 ≠ T0,1T1, T0,1h2, h0, 2 T2, T0, 2h2, h0, 2 T2, T0, 2Adiabatic flow 1 2h1, h0,1 h0, 2 = h0,1 T0, 2 = T0,1T1, T0,1 Nonisentropic flow 1 2p1, p0,1 p0, 2 ≠ p0,1 /H92670, 2 ≠ /H92670,1/H92671, /H92670,1p2, p0, 2 /H92672, /H92670, 2p2, p0, 2 /H92672, /H92670, 2Isentropic flow 1 2p1, p0,1 p0, 2 = p0,1 /H92670, 2 = /H92670,1/H92671, /H92670,1(a) (c)(b) (d) Figure 7.4 Comparisons between (a) nonadiabatic, (b) adiabatic, (c) nonisentropic, and (d) isentropic ﬂows. 2, in a general ﬂow ﬁeld, as sketched in Figure 7.4c. At point 1, the local static pressure and static density are p1andρ1, respectively; also the local total pressure and total density are p0,1andρ0,1, respectively, deﬁned as above. Similarly, at point 2, the local static pressure and static density are p2andρ2, respectively, and the local total pressure and total density are p0,2andρ0,2, respectively. If the ﬂow is nonisentropic between points 1 and 2, then p0,1/negationslash=p0,2andρ0,1/negationslash=ρ0,2, as shown in Figure 7.4c. On the other hand, if the ﬂow is isentropic between points1 and 2, then p 0,1=p0,2andρ0,1=ρ0,2, as shown in Figure 7.4d. Indeed, if the general ﬂow ﬁeld is isentropic throughout, then both p0andρ0are constant values throughout the ﬂow. As a corollary to the above considerations, we need another deﬁned tem- perature, denoted by T∗, and deﬁned as follows. Consider a point in a subsonic ﬂow where the local static temperature is T. At this point, imagine that the ﬂuid550 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow element is speeded up to sonic velocity, adiabatically. The temperature it would have at such sonic conditions is denoted as T∗. Similarly, consider a point in a supersonic ﬂow, where the local static temperature is T. At this point, imagine that the ﬂuid element is slowed down to sonic velocity, adiabatically. Again, the temperature it would have at such sonic conditions is denoted as T∗. The quantity T∗is simply a deﬁned quantity at a given point in a ﬂow, in exactly the same vein asT0,p0, andρ0are deﬁned quantities. Also, a∗=√γRT∗. EXAMPLE 7.6 At a point in an airﬂow the pressure, temperature, and velocity are 1 atm, 320 K, and 1000 m/s. Calculate the total temperature and total pressure at this point. ■Solution From Equation (7.54), h+V2 2=h0 Sinceh=cpT and cp=γR γ−1, we have cpT+V2 2=cpT0 T0=T+V2 2cp=T+/parenleftbiggγ−1 2γR/parenrightbigg V2 T0=320+/bracketleftbigg0.4 2(1.4)(287)/bracketrightbigg (1000)2=320+497.8 T0=817.8K By deﬁnition, the total pressure is the pressure that would exist if the ﬂow at the pointwere slowed isentropically to zero velocity. Hence, we can use the isentropic relations inEquation (7.32) to relate total to static conditions. That is, from Equation (7.32), p 0 p=/parenleftbiggT0 T/parenrightbiggγ γ−1 Hence, p0=p/parenleftbiggT0 T/parenrightbiggγ γ−1 =(1 atm)/parenleftbigg817.8 320/parenrightbigg1.4 0.4 P0=26.7 atm Note: In the above calculation of total pressure, we continued to use the nonconsistent unit of atmospheres. This is okay because Equation (7.32) contains a ratio of pressures, and therefore it would just be extra work to convert 1 atm to 1.01 ×105N/m2, and then carry out the calculation. The result is the same.CHAPTER 7Compressible Flow: Some Preliminary Aspects 551 EXAMPLE 7.7 An airplane is ﬂying at a standard altitude of 10,000 ft. A Pitot tube mounted at the nose measures a pressure of 2220 lb/ft2. The airplane is ﬂying at a high subsonic speed, faster than 300 mph. From our comments in Section 3.1, the ﬂow should be consideredcompressible. Calculate the velocity of the airplane. ■Solution From our discussion in Section 3.4, the pressure measured by a Pitot tube immersed inan incompressible ﬂow is the total pressure. For the same physical reasons discussed in Section 3.4, a Pitot tube also measures the total pressure in a high-speed subsonic com-pressible ﬂow. (This is further discussed in Section 8.7.1 on the measurement of velocityin a subsonic compressible ﬂow.) Caution: Because we are dealing with a compressible ﬂow in this example, we cannot use Bernoulli’s equation to calculate the velocity. The ﬂow in front of the Pitot tube is compressed isentropically to zero velocity at the mouth of the tube, hence the pressure at the mouth is the total pressure, p From Equation (7.32), we can write: p0 p∞=/parenleftbiggT0 T∞/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) (E.7.3) where p0andT0are the total pressure and temperature, respectively, at the mouth of the Pitot tube, and p∞andT∞are the freestream static pressure and static temperature, respectively. Solving Equation (E7.3) above for T0, we get T0=T∞/parenleftbiggp0 p∞/parenrightbigg(γ−1)/γ (E.7.4) From Appendix E, the pressure and temperature at a standard altitude of 10,000 ft are1455.6 lb/ft 2and 483.04◦R, respectively. These are the values of p∞andT∞in Equation (E7.4). Thus, from Equation (E7.4), T0=(483.04)/parenleftbigg2220 1455.6/parenrightbigg0.4/1.4 =544.9◦R From the energy equation, Equation (7.54), written in terms of temperature, we have cpT+V2 2=cpT0 (E.7.5) In Equation (E7.5), both TandVare the freestream values, hence we have cpT∞+V2 ∞ 2=cpT0 (E.7.6) Also, cp=γR γ−1=(1.4)(1716) 0.4=6006ft·lb slug ·◦R Solving Equation (E7.6) for V∞, we have V∞=[2cp(T0−T∞)]1/2 =[2(6006)(544.9 −483.04]1/2 =862 ft/s552 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Note: From this example, we see that the total pressure measured by a Pitot tube in a subsonic compressible ﬂow is a measure of the ﬂow velocity, but we need also the valueof the ﬂow static temperature in order to calculate the velocity. In Section 8.7, we showmore fundamentally that the ratio of Pitot pressure to ﬂow static pressure in a compressible ﬂow, subsonic or supersonic, is a direct measure of the Mach number, not the velocity. But more on this later. 7.6 SOME ASPECTS OF SUPERSONIC FLOW: SHOCK WAVES Return to the different regimes of ﬂow sketched in Figure 1.44. Note that subsonic compressible ﬂow is qualitatively (but not quantitatively) the same as incompress-ible ﬂow; Figure 1.44a shows a subsonic ﬂow with a smoothly varying streamline pattern, where the ﬂow far ahead of the body is forewarned about the presenceof the body and begins to adjust accordingly. In contrast, supersonic ﬂow is quitedifferent, as sketched in Figure 1.44d ande. Here, the ﬂow is dominated by shock waves, and the ﬂow upstream of the body does not know about the presence ofthe body until it encounters the leading-edge shock wave. In fact, any ﬂow witha supersonic region, such as those sketched in Figure 1.44b toe, is subject to shock waves. Thus, an essential ingredient of a study of supersonic ﬂow is thecalculation of the shape and strength of shock waves. This is the main thrust ofChapters 8 and 9. A shock wave is an extremely thin region, typically on the order of 10 −5cm, across which the ﬂow properties can change drastically. The shock wave is usua-lly at an oblique angle to the ﬂow, such as sketched in Figure 7.5a; however, thereare many cases where we are interested in a shock wave normal to the ﬂow, assketched in Figure 7.5b. Normal shock waves are discussed at length in Chapter 8,whereas oblique shocks are considered in Chapter 9. In both cases, the shock waveis an almost explosive compression process, where the pressure increases almostdiscontinuously across the wave. Examine Figure 7.5 closely. In region 1 aheadof the shock, the Mach number, ﬂow velocity, pressure, density, temperature,entropy, total pressure, and total enthalpy are denoted by M 1,V1,p1,ρ1,T1,s1, p0,1, and h0,1, respectively. The analogous quantities in region 2 behind the shock areM2,V2,p2,ρ2,T2,s2,p0,2, and h0,2, respectively. The qualitative changes across the wave are noted in Figure 7.5. The pressure, density, temperature, andentropy increase across the shock, whereas the total pressure, Mach number, andvelocity decrease. Physically, the ﬂow across a shock wave is adiabatic (we arenot heating the gas with a laser beam or cooling it in a refrigerator, for example).Therefore, recalling the discussion in Section 7.5, the total enthalpy is constantacross the wave. In both the oblique shock and normal shock cases, the ﬂow aheadof the shock wave must be supersonic (i.e., M 1>1). Behind the oblique shock, the ﬂow usually remains supersonic (i.e., M2>1), but at a reduced Mach number (i.e., M2<M1). However, as discussed in Chapter 9, there are special cases where the oblique shock is strong enough to decelerate the downstream ﬂow to a subsonicCHAPTER 7Compressible Flow: Some Preliminary Aspects 553 Figure 7.5 Qualitative pictures of ﬂow through oblique and normal shock waves. Mach number; hence, M2<1 can occur behind an oblique shock. For the normal shock, as sketched in Figure 7.5b, the downstream ﬂow is always subsonic (i.e., M2<1). Study the qualitative variations illustrated in Figure 7.5 closely. They are important, and you should have them in mind for our subsequent discussions. One of the primary purposes of Chapters 8 and 9 is to develop a shock-wave theorythat allows the quantitative evaluation of these variations. We prove that pressureincreases across the shock, that the upstream Mach number must be supersonic,etc. Moreover, we obtain equations that allow the direct calculation of changesacross the shock. Several photographs of shock waves are shown in Figure 7.6. Since air is transparent, we cannot usually see shock waves with the naked eye. However,because the density changes across the shock wave, light rays propagating throughthe ﬂow will be refracted across the shock. Special optical systems, such asshadowgraphs, schlieren, and interferometers, take advantage of this refractionand allow the visual imaging of shock waves on a screen or a photographicnegative. For details of the design and characteristics of these optical systems,see References 25 and 26. (Under certain conditions, you can see the refractedlight from a shock wave with your naked eye. Recall from Figure 1.43b that a shock wave can form in the locally supersonic region on the top surface of anairfoil if the freestream subsonic Mach number is high enough.

If you are lucky, you will see the shock wave dancing back and forth over the top of the wing.) In summary, compressible ﬂows introduce some very exciting physical phe- nomena into our aerodynamic studies. Moreover, as the ﬂow changes from sub-sonic to supersonic, the complete nature of the ﬂow changes, not the least ofwhich is the occurrence of shock waves. The purpose of the next seven chaptersis to describe and analyze these ﬂows.556 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 7.7 SUMMARY As usual, examine the road map for this chapter (Figure 7.1), and make certain that you feel comfortable with the material represented by this road map beforecontinuing further.

Similarly, total pressure p 0and total density ρ0are deﬁned as the properties that would exist if (in our imagination) we slowed the ﬂuid element at a point in the ﬂow to zero velocity isentropically. Ifa general ﬂow ﬁeld is adiabatic, h 0is constant throughout the ﬂow; in contrast, if the ﬂow ﬁeld is nonadiabatic, h0varies from one point to another. Similarly, if a general ﬂow ﬁeld is isentropic, p0andρ0are constant throughout the ﬂow; in contrast, if the ﬂow ﬁeld is nonisentropic, p0andρ0vary from one point to another. Shock waves are very thin regions in a supersonic ﬂow across which thepressure, density, temperature, and entropy increase; the Mach number, ﬂowvelocity, and total pressure decrease; and the total enthalpy stays the same. 7.8 PROBLEMS Note: In the following problems, you will deal with both the International System of Units (SI) (N, kg, m, s, K) and the English Engineering System(lb, slug, ft, s, ◦R). Which system to use will be self-evident in each problem. All problems deal with calorically perfect air as the gas, unless otherwise noted.Also, recall that 1 atm =2116 lb/ft 2=1.01×105N/m2. 7.1The temperature and pressure at the stagnation point of a high-speedmissile are 934 ◦R and 7.8 atm, respectively. Calculate the density at this point.CHAPTER 7Compressible Flow: Some Preliminary Aspects 559 7.2Calculate cp,cv,e, and hfor a. The stagnation point conditions given in Problem 7.1 b.

Calculate the changesin enthalpy, internal energy, and entropy across the wave. 7.4Consider the isentropic ﬂow over an airfoil. The freestream conditions are T ∞=245 K and p∞=4.35×104N/m2. At a point on the airfoil, the pressure is 3.6 ×104N/m2. Calculate the density at this point. 7.5Consider the isentropic ﬂow through a supersonic wind-tunnel nozzle. Thereservoir properties are T 0=500 K and p0=10 atm. If p=1 atm at the nozzle exit, calculate the exit temperature and density. 7.6Consider air at a pressure of 0.2 atm.

Calculate the total enthalpy at this point. 7.8In the reservoir of a supersonic wind tunnel, the velocity is negligible, andthe temperature is 1000 K. The temperature at the nozzle exit is 600 K.Assuming adiabatic ﬂow through the nozzle, calculate the velocity atthe exit. 7.9An airfoil is in a freestream where p ∞=0.61 atm, ρ∞=0.819 kg/m3, andV∞=300 m/s.

However, the terms in Bernoulli’s equation have dimensions of energy per unit volume (check it out), which promptsome argument that Bernoulli’s equation is an energy equation forincompressible ﬂow. If this is so, then it should be derivable from theenergy equation for compressible ﬂow discussed in the present chapter.Starting with Equation (7.53) for inviscid, adiabatic compressible ﬂow,make the appropriate assumptions for an incompressible ﬂow and seewhat you need to do to obtain Bernoulli’s equation.CHAPTER 8 Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics Shock wave: A large-amplitude compression wave, such as that produced by an explosion, caused by supersonic motion of a body in a medium. From the American Heritage Dictionaryof the English Language, 1969 PREVIEW BOX When you have a supersonic ﬂow, chances are that you also have shock waves. Shock waves are excep-tionally thin regions—usually much thinner than thethickness of this page—across which the ﬂow prop-erties change drastically. Take pressure for example.The gas pressure in front of the shock wave may be1 atm, and immediately behind it the pressure may be20 atm. Imagine that you are a ﬂuid element cross-ing the shock wave; at one moment you are at 1 atmpressure and a split second later you are at 20 atm. Ido not know about you, but if it were me I would beshocked out of my mind. (Perhaps this is why we callthem “shock” waves.) This chapter is all about shock waves. Here we learn how to calculate the change in ﬂow propertiesacross a shock, and we examine the important phys-ical aspects and consequences of shock waves. Inthis chapter, we focus on shock waves that are per-pendicular to the ﬂow—normal shock waves. Whatwe learn here is directly transferable to the study ofshock waves that make an oblique angle to the ﬂow—oblique shock waves—discussed in the next chapter.A study of shock-wave phenomena is one of the mostimportant aspects of learning about supersonic ﬂows.So take this chapter very seriously. Besides, shockwaves are rather exciting events in nature, so enjoythis excitement. 561562 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 8.1 INTRODUCTION The purpose of this chapter and Chapter 9 is to develop shock-wave theory, thus giving us the means to calculate the changes in the ﬂow properties across a wave.These changes were discussed qualitatively in Section 7.6; make certain that youare familiar with these changes before continuing. The focus of this chapter is on normal shock waves, as sketched in Figure 7.4b . At ﬁrst thought, a shock wave that is normal to the upstream ﬂow may seem to bea very special case—and therefore a case of little practical interest—but nothingcould be further from the truth. Normal shocks occur frequently in nature. Twosuch examples are sketched in Figure 8.1; there are many more. The supersonicﬂow over a blunt body is shown at the left of Figure 8.1. Here, a strong bowshock wave exists in front of the body. (We study such bow shocks in Chapter 9.)Although this wave is curved, the region of the shock closest to the nose isessentially normal to the ﬂow. Moreover, the streamline that passes through thisnormal portion of the bow shock later impinges on the nose of the body andcontrols the values of stagnation (total) pressure and temperature at the nose. Sincethe nose region of high-speed blunt bodies is of practical interest in the calculationof drag and aerodynamic heating, the properties of the ﬂow behind the normalportion of the shock wave take on some importance. In another example, shownat the right of Figure 8.1, supersonic ﬂow is established inside a nozzle (whichcan be a supersonic wind tunnel, a rocket engine, etc.) where the back pressureis high enough to cause a normal shock wave to stand inside the nozzle. (Wediscuss such “overexpanded” nozzle ﬂows in Chapter 10.) The conditions underwhich this shock wave will occur and the determination of ﬂow properties at thenozzle exit downstream of the normal shock are both important questions to beanswered. In summary, for these and many other applications, the study of normalshock waves is important. Finally, we will ﬁnd that many of the normal shock relations derived in this chapter carry over directly to the analysis of oblique shock waves, as discussed Figure 8.1 Two examples where normal shock waves are of interest.CHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 563 Figure 8.2 Road map for Chapter 8. in Chapter 9. So once again, time spent on normal shock waves is time well spent. The road map for this chapter is given in Figure 8.2. As you can see, our objectives are fairly short and straightforward. We start with a derivation of thebasic continuity, momentum, and energy equations for normal shock waves, andthen we employ these basic relations to obtain detailed equations for the calcu-lation of ﬂow properties across the shock wave. In addition, we emphasize thephysical trends indicated by the equations. On the way toward this objective,we take three side streets having to do with (1) the speed of sound, (2) specialforms of the energy equation, and (3) a further discussion of the criteria used tojudge when a ﬂow must be treated as compressible. Finally, we apply the resultsof this chapter to the measurement of airspeed in a compressible ﬂow using aPitot tube. Keep the road map in Figure 8.2 in mind as you progress through thechapter. 8.2 THE BASIC NORMAL SHOCK EQUATIONS Consider the normal shock wave sketched in Figure 8.3. Region 1 is a uniformﬂow upstream of the shock, and region 2 is a different uniform ﬂow downstreamof the shock. The pressure, density, temperature, Mach number, velocity, totalpressure, total enthalpy, total temperature, and entropy in region 1 are p 1,ρ1, T1,M1,u1,p0,1,h0,1,T0,1, and s1, respectively. The corresponding variables in region 2 are denoted by p2,ρ2,T2,M2,u2,p0,2,h0,2,T0,2, and s2. (Note that we are denoting the magnitude of the ﬂow velocity by urather than V; reasons for this will become obvious as we progress.) The problem of the normal shock wave564 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 8.3 Sketch of a normal wave. is simply stated as follows: given the ﬂow properties upstream of the wave ( p1, T1,M1, etc.), calculate the ﬂow properties ( p2,T2,M2, etc.) downstream of the wave. Let us proceed. Consider the rectangular control volume abcd given by the dashed line in Figure 8.3. The shock wave is inside the control volume, as shown. Side abis the edge view of the left face of the control volume; this left face is perpendicular to the ﬂow, and its area is A. Side cdis the edge view of the right face of the control volume; this right face is also perpendicular to the ﬂow, and its area is A. We apply the integral form of conservation equations to this control volume. In the process, we observe three important physical facts about the ﬂow given inFigure 8.3: 1.The ﬂow is steady, that is, ∂/∂t=0. 2.The ﬂow is adiabatic, that is, ˙q=0. We are not adding or taking away heat from the control volume (we are not heating the shock wave with a Bunsen burner, for example). The temperature increases across the shock wave, notbecause heat is being added, but rather, because kinetic energy is convertedto internal energy across the shock wave. 3.There are no viscous effects on the sides of the control volume. The shockwave itself is a thin region of extremely high velocity and temperaturegradients; hence, friction and thermal conduction play an important role onthe ﬂow structure inside the wave. However, the wave itself is buried insidethe control volume, and with the integral form of the conservationequations, we are not concerned about the details of what goes on insidethe control volume. 4.There are no body forces; f=0.CHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 565 Consider the continuity equation in the form of Equation (7.39). For the conditions described above, Equation (7.39) becomes ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SρV·dS=0 (8.1) To evaluate Equation (8.1) over the face ab, note that Vis pointing into the control volume, whereas dSby deﬁnition is pointing out of the control volume, in the opposite direction of V; hence, V·dSis negative. Moreover, ρand|V| are uniform over the face aband equal to ρ1andu1, respectively. Hence, the contribution of face abto the surface integral in Equation (8.1) is simply −ρ 1u1A. Over the right face cdboth VanddSare in the same direction, and hence V·dS is positive. Moreover, ρand|V|are uniform over the face cdand equal to ρ2and u2, respectively. Thus, the contribution of face cdto the surface integral is ρ2u2A. On sides bcandad,VanddSare always perpendicular; hence, V·dS=0, and these sides make no contribution to the surface integral. Hence, for the control volume shown in Figure 8.3, Equation (8.1) becomes −ρ 1u1A+ρ2u2A=0 or ρ1u1=ρ2u2 (8.2) Equation (8.2) is the continuity equation for normal shock waves. Consider the momentum equation in the form of Equation (7.41). For the ﬂow we are treating here, Equation (7.41) becomes ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)V=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SpdS (8.3) Equation (8.3) is a vector equation. Note that in Figure 8.3, the ﬂow is movingonly in one direction (i.e., in the xdirection). Hence, we need to consider only the scalar xcomponent of Equation (8.3), which is ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)u=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(pdS)x (8.4) In Equation (8.4), (pdS)xis the xcomponent of the vector (pdS). Note that over the face ab,dSpoints to the left (i.e., in the negative xdirection). Hence, (pdS)x is negative over face ab. By similar reasoning, (pdS)xis positive over the face cd. Again noting that all the ﬂow variables are uniform over the faces abandcd, the surface integrals in Equation (8.4) become ρ1(−u 1A)u1+ρ2(u2A)u2=−(−p1A+p2A) (8.5) or p1+ρ1u2 1=p2+ρ2u22 (8.6) Equation (8.6) is the momentum equation for normal shock waves.566 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Consider the energy equation in the form of Equation (7.43). For steady, adiabatic, inviscid ﬂow with no body forces, this equation becomes ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Sρ/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg V·dS=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SpV·dS (8.7) Evaluating Equation (8.7) for the control surface shown in Figure 8.3, we have −ρ 1/parenleftbigg e1+u2 1 2/parenrightbigg u1A+ρ2/parenleftbigg e2+u22 2/parenrightbigg u2A=−(−p1u1A+p2u2A) Rearranging, we obtain p1u1+ρ1/parenleftbigg e1+u21 2/parenrightbigg u1=p2u2+ρ2/parenleftbigg e2+u22 2/parenrightbigg u2 (8.8) Dividing by Equation (8.2), that is, dividing the left-hand side of Equation (8.8) byρ1u1and the right-hand side by ρ2u2, we have p1 ρ1+e1+u2 1 2=p2 ρ2+e2+u22 2(8.9) From the deﬁnition of enthalpy, h≡e+pv=e+p/ρ. Hence, Equation (8.9) becomes h1+u21 2=h2+u22 2(8.10) Equation (8.10) is the energy equation for normal shock waves. Equation (8.10) should come as no surprise; the ﬂow through a shock wave is adiabatic, and wederived in Section 7.5 the fact that for a steady, adiabatic ﬂow, h 0=h+V2/2= const. Equation (8.10) simply states that h0(hence, for a calorically perfect gas T0) is constant across the shock wave. Therefore, Equation (8.10) is consistent with the general results obtained in Section 7.5. Repeating the above results for clarity, the basic normal shock equations are Continuity: ρ1u1=ρ2u2 (8.2) Momentum: p1+ρ1u2 1=p2+ρ2u22 (8.6) Energy: h1+u21 2=h2+u22 2(8.10) Examine these equations closely. Recall from Figure 8.3 that all conditions up- stream of the wave, ρ1,u1,p1, etc., are known. Thus, the above equations are a system of three algebraic equations in four unknowns, ρ2,u2,p2, and h2. However, if we add the following thermodynamic relations Enthalpy: h2=cpT2 Equation of state: p2=ρ2RT2 we have ﬁve equations for ﬁve unknowns, namely, ρ2,u2,p2,h2, and T2. In Sec- tion 8.6, we explicitly solve these equations for the unknown quantities behindCHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 567 the shock. However, rather than going directly to that solution, we ﬁrst take three side trips as shown in the road map in Figure 8.2. These side trips involve discus-sions of the speed of sound (Section 8.3), alternate forms of the energy equation(Section 8.4), and compressibility (Section 8.5)—all of which are necessary fora viable discussion of shock-wave properties in Section 8.6. Finally, we note that Equations (8.2), (8.6), and (8.10) are not limited to normal shock waves; they describe the changes that take place in any steady,adiabatic, inviscid ﬂow where only one direction is involved. That is, in Figure 8.3,the ﬂow is in the xdirection only. This type of ﬂow, where the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables are functions of xonly [ p=p(x),u=u(x), etc.], is deﬁned as one-dimensional ﬂow. Thus, Equations (8.2), (8.6), and (8.10) are governing equations for one-dimensional, steady, adiabatic, inviscid ﬂow. 8.3 SPEED OF SOUND Common experience tells us that sound travels through air at some ﬁnite velocity.For example, you see a ﬂash of lightning in the distance, but you hear the corre-sponding thunder at some later moment. What is the physical mechanism of thepropagation of sound waves? How can we calculate the speed of sound? Whatproperties of the gas does it depend on? The speed of sound is an extremely impor-tant quantity which dominates the physical properties of compressible ﬂow, andhence the answers to the above questions are vital to our subsequent discussions.The purpose of this section is to address these questions. The physical mechanism of sound propagation in a gas is based on molecular motion. For example, imagine that you are sitting in a room, and suppose that aﬁrecracker goes off in one corner. When the ﬁrecracker detonates, chemical energy(basically a form of heat release) is transferred to the air molecules adjacentto the ﬁrecracker. These energized molecules are moving about in a randomfashion. They eventually collide with some of their neighboring molecules andtransfer their high energy to these neighbors. In turn, these neighboring moleculeseventually collide with their neighbors and transfer energy in the process. Bymeans of this “domino” effect, the energy released by the ﬁrecracker is propagatedthrough the air by molecular collisions. Moreover, because T,p, andρfor a gas are macroscopic averages of the detailed microscopic molecular motion, theregions of energized molecules are also regions of slight variations in the localtemperature, pressure, and density. Hence, as this energy wave from the ﬁrecrackerpasses over our eardrums, we “hear” the slight pressure changes in the wave. Thisissound, and the propagation of the energy wave is simply the propagation of a sound wave through the gas. Because a sound wave is propagated by molecular collisions, and because the molecules of a gas are moving with an average velocity of√ 8RT/πgiven by kinetic theory, then we would expect the velocity of propagation of a sound waveto be approximately the average molecular velocity. Indeed, the speed of sound isabout three-quarters of the average molecular velocity. In turn, because the kinetictheory expression given above for the average molecular velocity depends only568 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 8.4 Moving and stationary sound waves; two analogous pictures, only the perspective is different. on the temperature of the gas, we might expect the speed of sound to also depend on temperature only. Let us explore this matter further; indeed, let us now derive an equation for the speed of sound in a gas. Although the propagation of soundis due to molecular collisions, we do not use such a microscopic picture for ourderivation. Rather, we take advantage of the fact that the macroscopic properties p,T,ρ, etc., change across the wave, and we use our macroscopic equations of continuity, momentum, and energy to analyze these changes. Consider a sound wave propagating through a gas with velocity a, as sketched in Figure 8.4 a. Here, the sound wave is moving from right to left into a stagnant gas (region 1), where the local pressure, temperature, and density are p,T, and ρ, respectively. Behind the sound wave (region 2), the gas properties are slightly different and are given by p+dp,T+dT, andρ+dρ, respectively. Now imagine that you hop on the wave and ride with it. When you look upstream, into region 1,you see the gas moving toward you with a relative velocity a, as sketched in Figure 8.4b . When you look downstream, into region 2, you see the gas receding away from you with a relative velocity a+da, as also shown in Figure 8.4. (We have enough ﬂuid-dynamic intuition by now to realize that because the pressurechanges across the wave by the amount dp, then the relative ﬂow velocity must also change across the wave by some amount da. Hence, the relative ﬂow velocity behind the wave is a+da.) Consequently, in Figure 8.4b , we have a picture of a stationary sound wave, with the ﬂow ahead of it moving left to right withvelocity a. The pictures in Figure 8.4 aandbare analogous; only the perspective is different. For purposes of analysis, we use Figure 8.4b . (Note: Figure 8.4b is similar to the picture of a normal shock wave shown in Figure 8.3. In Figure 8.3, the normal shock wave is stationary, and the upstreamﬂow is moving left to right at a velocity u If the upstream ﬂow were to be suddenly shut off, then the normal shock wave in Figure 8.3 would suddenlypropagate to the left with a wave velocity of u 1, similar to the moving sound wave shown in Figure 8.4 a. The analysis of moving waves is slightly more subtle than the analysis of stationary waves; hence, it is simpler to begin a study ofshock waves and sound waves with the pictures of stationary waves as shownCHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 569 in Figures 8.3 and 8.4b . Also, please note that the sound wave in Figure 8.4b is nothing more than an inﬁnitely weak normal shock wave.) Examine closely the ﬂow through the sound wave sketched in Figure 8.4b . The ﬂow is one-dimensional. Moreover, it is adiabatic, because we have no source of heat transfer into or out of the wave (e.g., we are not “zapping” the wave witha laser beam or heating it with a torch). Finally, the gradients within the waveare very small—the changes dp,dT,dρ, and daare inﬁnitesimal. Therefore, the inﬂuence of dissipative phenomena (viscosity and thermal conduction) isnegligible. As a result, the ﬂow through the sound wave is both adiabatic andreversible—the ﬂow is isentropic. Since we have now established that the ﬂow is one-dimensional and isentropic, let us apply the appropriate governing equationsto the picture shown in Figure 8.4b . Applying the continuity equation, Equation (8.2), to Figure 8.4b , we have ρa=(ρ+dρ)(a+da) or ρa=ρa+adρ+ρda+dρda (8.11) The product of two differentials, dρda, can be neglected in comparison with the other terms in Equation (8.11). Hence, solving Equation (8.11) for a, we obtain a=−ρda dρ(8.12) Now consider the one-dimensional momentum equation, Equation (8.6), appliedto Figure 8.4b : p+ρa 2=(p+dp)+(ρ+dρ)(a+da)2(8.13) Again ignoring products of differentials, Equation (8.13) becomes dp=−2aρda−a2dρ (8.14) Solving Equation (8.14) for da, we have da=dp+a2dρ −2aρ(8.15) Substituting Equation (8.15) into (8.12), we obtain a=−ρdp/dρ+a2 −2aρ(8.16) Solving Equation (8.16) for a2, we have a2=dp dρ(8.17) As discussed above, the ﬂow through a sound wave is isentropic; hence, in Equa-tion (8.17), the rate of change of pressure with respect to density, dp/dρ, is an570 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow isentropic change. Hence, we can rewrite Equation (8.17) as a=/radicalBigg/parenleftbigg∂p ∂ρ/parenrightbigg s(8.18) Equation (8.18) is a fundamental expression for the speed of sound in a gas. Assume that the gas is calorically perfect. For such a case, the isentropic relation given by Equation (7.32) holds, namely, p1 p2=/parenleftbiggρ1 ρ2/parenrightbiggγ (8.19) From Equation (8.19), we have p ργ=const=c or p=cργ(8.20) Differentiating Equation (8.20) with respect to ρ, we obtain /parenleftbigg∂p ∂ρ/parenrightbigg s=cγργ−1(8.21) Substituting Equation (8.20) for the constant cin Equation (8.21), we have /parenleftbigg∂p ∂ρ/parenrightbigg s=/parenleftbiggp ργ/parenrightbigg γργ−1=γp ρ(8.22) Substituting Equation (8.22) into (8.18), we obtain a=/radicalbiggγp ρ(8.23) Equation (8.23) is an expression for the speed of sound in a calorically perfect gas. At ﬁrst glance, Equation (8.23) seems to imply that the speed of sound woulddepend on both pandρ. However, pressure and density are related through the perfect gas equation of state, p ρ=RT (8.24) Hence, substituting Equation (8.24) into (8.23), we have a=√γRT (8.25) which is our ﬁnal expression for the speed of sound; it clearly states that thespeed of sound in a calorically perfect gas is a function of temperature only. This is consistent with our earlier discussion of the speed of sound being a molec-ular phenomenon, and therefore it is related to the average molecular velocity√ 8RT/π.CHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 571 The speed of sound at standard sea level is a useful value to remember; it is as=340.9 m/s =1117 ft/s Recall the deﬁnition of compressibility given in Section 7.3. In particular, from Equation (7.35) for the isentropic compressibility, repeated below, τs=−1 v/parenleftbigg∂v ∂p/parenrightbigg s and recalling that v=1/ρ(hence, dv=−dρ/ρ2), we have τs=−ρ/bracketleftbigg −1 ρ2/parenleftbigg∂ρ ∂p/parenrightbigg s/bracketrightbigg =1 ρ(∂p/∂ρ) s(8.26) However, recall from Equation (8.18) that (∂p/∂ρ) s=a2. Hence, Equation (8.26) becomes τs=1 ρa2 or a=/radicalBigg 1 ρτs(8.27) Equation (8.27) relates the speed of sound to the compressibility of a gas. The lower the compressibility, the higher the speed of sound. Recall that for thelimiting case of an incompressible ﬂuid τ s=0. Hence, Equation (8.27) states that the speed of sound in a theoretically incompressible ﬂuid is inﬁnite. In turn,for an incompressible ﬂow with ﬁnite velocity V, the Mach number, M=V/a, is zero. Hence, the incompressible ﬂows treated in Chapters 3 to 6 are theoreticallyzero-Mach-number ﬂows. Finally, in regard to additional physical meaning of the Mach number, consider a ﬂuid element moving along a streamline. The kinetic and internal energies perunit mass are V 2/2 and e, respectively. Their ratio is [recalling Equations (7.6 a), (7.10), and (8.25)] V2/2 e=V2/2 cvT=V2/2 RT/(γ−1)=(γ/2) V2 a2/(γ−1)=γ(γ−1) 2M2 Hence, we see that the square of the Mach number is proportional to the ratio ofkinetic energy to internal energy of a gas ﬂow. In other words, the Mach numberis a measure of the directed motion of the gas compared with the random thermalmotion of the molecules. EXAMPLE 8.1 Consider an airplane ﬂying at a velocity of 250 m/s. Calculate its Mach number if it is ﬂying at a standard altitude of ( a) sea level, (b )5k m ,( c) 10 km.572 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow ■Solution (a) From Appendix D for the standard atmosphere, at sea level, T∞=288 K. a∞=/radicalbig γRT=/radicalbig (1.4)(287)(288) =340.2 m/s Hence, M∞=V∞ a∞=250 340.2=0.735 (b) At 5 km, from Appendix D, T∞=255.7. a∞=/radicalbig (1.4)(287)(255.7) =320.5 m/s M∞=V∞ a∞=250 320.2=0.78 (c) At 10 km, from Appendix D, T∞=223.3. a∞=/radicalbig (1.4)(287)(223.3) =299.5 m/s M∞=V∞ a∞=250 299.5=0.835 Note: (1) The Mach number used here is the freestream Mach number. When we refer to the Mach number of an airplane or any other object in ﬂight, it is the velocity of the object divided by the freestream speed of sound. (2) The Mach number of the airplane in this example obviously depends on the altitude at which it is ﬂying, because the speed of sound is different at different altitudes.In this example, an airplane velocity of 250 m/s corresponds to a Mach number of 0.735at sea level, but a higher Mach number of 0.835 at an altitude of 10 km. EXAMPLE 8.2 Consider the ﬂow properties at the point in the ﬂow described in Example 7.3, where thetemperature is 320 K and the velocity is 1000 m/s. Calculate the Mach number at thispoint. ■Solution a=/radicalbig γRT=/radicalbig (1.4)(287)(320) =358.6 m/s M=V a=1000 358.6=2.79 Note: This simple calculation is given here to demonstrate that Mach number is a local property of the ﬂow; it varies from point-to-point throughout the ﬂow ﬁeld. This is incontrast to the freestream Mach number calculated in Example 8.1. A purpose of thesetwo examples is to illustrate the two uses of Mach number. EXAMPLE 8.3 Calculate the ratio of kinetic energy to internal energy at a point in an airﬂow where theMach number is: ( a)M=2, and (b )M=20.CHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 573 ■Solution (a)V2/2 e=γ(γ−1) 2M2=(1.4)(0.4) 2(2)2=1.12 (b)V2/2 e=γ(γ−1) 2M2=(1.4)(0.4) 2(20)2=112 Note: Examining these two results, we see that at Mach 2, the kinetic energy and internal energy are about the same, whereas at the large hypersonic Mach number of 20, the kinetic energy is more than a hundred times larger than the internal energy. This is onecharacteristic of hypersonic ﬂows—high ratios of kinetic to internal energy. EXAMPLE 8.4 Consider a point in a ﬂow of air where the pressure and density are 0.7 atm and 0.0019slug/ft 3, respectively. (a) Calculate the corresponding value of the isentropic compress- ibility. (b) From that value of the isentropic compressibility, calculate the speed of soundat the point in the ﬂow. ■Solution (a) The isentropic compressibility, τs, is deﬁned by Equation (7.35), τs=−1 v/parenleftbigg∂v ∂p/parenrightbigg s(7.35) The relation between pandvfor an isentropic process is given by Equation (7.32), which can be written in the form: p=cργ=c/parenleftbigg1 v/parenrightbiggγ (E8.1) where cis a constant. Solving Equation (E8.1) for vgives v=c1p−(1/γ)(E8.2) where c1=c(1/γ), another constant value. Differentiating Equation (E8.2), we have /parenleftbigg∂v ∂p/parenrightbigg s=c1/parenleftbigg −1 γ/parenrightbigg p−(1/γ)−1(E8.3) From Equation (E8.2) c1=vp1/γ Substituting this expression for c1into Equation (E8.3), /parenleftbigg∂v ∂p/parenrightbigg s=−1 γ/parenleftbig vp1/γ/parenrightbig p−(1/γ)−1=−v γp Substituting this result into Equation (7.35), we have τs=−1 v/parenleftbigg −v γp/parenrightbigg =1 γp(E8.4)574 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Thus, for air at a pressure of 0.7 atm, Equation (E8.4) yields τs=1 (1.4)(0.7)=1.02 atm−1 (b) From Equation (8.27) a=/radicalbigg 1 ρτs(8.27) and using consistent units for τsgives τs=1.02 atm−1/parenleftbigg1atm 2116 lb/ft2/parenrightbigg =4.82×10−4(lb/ft2)−1 we have a=/radicalbigg 1 ρτs=/radicalbigg 1 0.0019(4.82 ×10−4)=1045 ft/s Check: T=p ρR=(0.7)(2116) (0.0019)(1716)=454.3◦R From Equation (8.25) a=/radicalbig γRT=/radicalbig (1.4)(1716)(454.3) =1045 ft/s The answer checks! EXAMPLE 8.5 By the seventeenth century it was understood that sound propagates through air at some ﬁnite velocity. By the time Isaac Newton published his Principia in 1687, artillery tests had already shown that the sea-level speed of sound was approximately 1140 ft/s. Comparingthat result with today’s knowledge of the standard speed of sound at sea level, namely1117 ft/s, shows that these early seventeenth century measurements were remarkablyaccurate. Armed with this experimental result for the speed of sound, Isaac Newton inhisPrincipia made the ﬁrst calculation of the speed of sound (see Reference 58). Here Newton correctly theorized that the speed of sound was related to the “elasticity” of theair, which is the reciprocal of the compressibility, τ. However, he incorrectly assumed that the changes of properties in a sound wave took place isothermally. Using Newton’sassumption of isothermal changes through the sound wave, calculate the value obtainedby Newton for sea-level speed of sound. ■Solution The isothermal compressibility is deﬁned as τT=−1 v/parenleftbigg∂v ∂p/parenrightbigg T(7.34)CHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 575 From the equation of state, v=RT/p. Thus /parenleftbigg∂v ∂p/parenrightbigg T=−RT p2 Substituting this result into Equation (7.34), we have τT=−1 v/parenleftbigg −RT p2/parenrightbigg =RT (pv)p=RT (RT)p=1 p(E8.5) Using this isothermal value for the compressibility in Equation (8.27) rather than the correct isentropic compressibility, we have (incorrectly) aT=/radicalbigg 1 ρτT(Newton’s incorrect result) (E8.6) At standard sea level, p=2116 lb/ft2andρ=0.002377 slug/ft3. Hence, the calculation of the speed of sound assuming isothermal conditions through the sound wave is, fromEquations (E8.5) and (E8.6), a T=/radicalbigg 1 ρτT=/radicalbiggp ρ=/radicalbigg 2116 0.002377=943.5 ft/s Isaac Newton reported in his Principia a value of 979 ft/s for the speed of sound, about 4 percent higher than the value calculated in this example. The difference is most likelydue to the rather imprecise values for sea-level atmospheric properties known in Newton’stime. Note: The isentropic compressibility is given by τ s=1 γp(E8.4) The isothermal compressibility is given by τT=1 p(E8.5) The two values differ by the factor γ. The speed of sound calculated from the isothermal compressibility will be smaller than that calculated from the isentropic compressibilityby the factor (γ) −1/2, or by 0.845. The isothermal calculation will yield a speed of sound about 15 percent lower than the correct value. It is interesting that Newton’s calculatedvalue of the speed of sound, as reported in his Principia, was about 15 percent lower than the measured value at that time of 1140 ft/s. Undaunted, Newton tried to explainaway the differences as due to the presence of dust particles and water vapor in theatmosphere. Finally, a century later the French mathematician Laplace corrected Newton’serror by correctly assuming that a sound wave was adiabatic, not isothermal. Therefore,by Napoleon’s time in the 1820s, the process and relationship for the propagation of soundin a gas were fully understood. 8.3.1 Comments In Examples 8.4 and 8.5 we dealt with the role of compressibility, τ, in the determination of the speed of sound. We found that both τTandτsare functions576 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow of pressure. When τsis used in Equation (8.27) to obtain the speed of sound, density also appears in the equation, making it seem that a=a(ρ,p). Indeed, for both Examples 8.4 and 8.5, we used values of both pandρto calculate the speed of sound. But keep in mind that pandρin the equation for speed of sound always appear in the form p/ρ[see Equation (8.23), for example], and from the perfect gas equation of state, p/ρ=RT. Hence, we emphasize again that the speed of sound in a perfect gas is a function of temperature only. If we have a gas, and we double the pressure of this gas while keeping the temperature constant, the speed of sound remains the same. If we halve the density, keeping the temperatureconstant, the speed of sound remains the same. Only in the case of an equilibriumchemically reacting gas and/or a gas where intermolecular forces are important(a gas that is nota perfect gas, as discussed in Section 7.2.1), does the speed of sound become a function of both temperature and pressure (see, for example,References 21 and 52). EXAMPLE 8.6 (a) Consider a long tube with a length of 300 m. The tube is ﬁlled with air at a temperature of 320 K. A sound wave is generated at one end of the tube. How long will it take for thewave to reach the other end? (b) If the tube is ﬁlled with helium at a temperature of 320 K, and a sound wave is generated at one end of the tube, how long will it take the sound wave to reach the other end? For amonatomic gas such as helium, γ=1.67. Also, for helium R = 2078.5 J/(Kg ·K). ■Solution (a) a=/radicalbig γRT=/radicalbig (1.4)(287)(320) =358.6 m/s Letting l=length of the tube and t=time for the sound wave to traverse the length l, t=l a=300 358.6=0.837 s (b) a=/radicalbig γRT=/radicalbig (1.67)(2078.5)(320) =1054 m/s t=l a=300 1054=0.285 s Note: The speed of sound in helium is much faster than in air at the same temperature for two reasons: (1) γis larger for helium and, more important, (2) helium has a molecular weight M=4, which is much lighter than that for air with M=28. Because R=/Rfractur/M where /Rfracturis the universal gas constant, the same value for all gases, then Rfor helium is much larger than for air. 8.4 SPECIAL FORMS OF THE ENERGY EQUATION In this section, we elaborate upon the energy equation for adiabatic ﬂow, as originally given by Equation (7.44). In Section 7.5, we obtained for a steady,CHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 577 adiabatic, inviscid ﬂow the result that h1+V2 1 2=h2+V2 2 2(8.28) where V1andV2are velocities at any two points along a three-dimensional stream- line. For the sake of consistency in our current discussion of one-dimensional ﬂow, let us use u1andu2in Equation (8.28): h1+u2 1 2=h2+u22 2(8.29) However, keep in mind that all the subsequent results in this section hold in general along a streamline and are by no means limited to just one-dimensionalﬂows. Specializing Equation (8.29) to a calorically perfect gas, where h=c pT, we have cpT1+u2 1 2=cpT2+u22 2(8.30) From Equation (7.9), Equation (8.30) becomes γRT1 γ−1+u21 2=γRT2 γ−1+u22 2(8.31) Since a=√γRT, Equation (8.31) can be written as a2 1 γ−1+u21 2=a2 2 γ−1+u22 2(8.32) If we consider point 2 in Equation (8.32) to be a stagnation point, where the stagnation speed of sound is denoted by a0, then, with u2=0, Equation (8.32) yields (dropping the subscript 1) a2 γ−1+u2 2=a2 0 γ−1(8.33) In Equation (8.33), aanduare the speed of sound and ﬂow velocity, respectively, at any given point in the ﬂow, and a0is the stagnation (or total) speed of sound associated with that same point. Equivalently, if we have any two points along a streamline, Equation (8.33) states that a2 1 γ−1+u2 1 2=a2 2 γ−1+u22 2=a2 0 γ−1=const (8.34)578 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Recalling the deﬁnition of a∗given at the end of Section 7.5, let point 2 in Equation (8.32) represent sonic ﬂow, where u=a∗. Then a2 γ−1+u2 2=a∗2 γ−1+a∗2 2 ora2 γ−1+u2 2=γ+1 2(γ−1)a∗2(8.35) In Equation (8.35), aanduare the speed of sound and ﬂow velocity, respectively, at any given point in the ﬂow, and a∗is a characteristic value associated with that same point. Equivalently, if we have any two points along a streamline, Equation (8.35) states that a2 1 γ−1+u2 1 2=a2 2 γ−1+u22 2=γ+1 2(γ−1)a∗2=const (8.36) Comparing the right-hand sides of Equations (8.34) and (8.36), the two proper- tiesa0anda∗associated with the ﬂow are related by γ+1 2(γ−1)a∗2=a2 0 γ−1=const (8.37) Clearly, these deﬁned quantities, a0anda∗, are both constants along a given streamline in a steady, adiabatic, inviscid ﬂow. If all the streamlines emanate fromthe same uniform freestream conditions, then a 0anda∗are constants throughout the entire ﬂow ﬁeld. Recall the deﬁnition of total temperature T0, as discussed in Section 7.5. In Equation (8.30), let u2=0; hence T2=T0. Dropping the subscript 1, we have cpT+u2 2=cpT0 (8.38) Equation (8.38) provides a formula from which the deﬁned total temperature T0 can be calculated from the given actual conditions of Tanduat any given point in a general ﬂow ﬁeld. Equivalently, if we have any two points along a streamlinein a steady, adiabatic, inviscid ﬂow, Equation (8.38) states that c pT1+u2 1 2=cpT2+u22 2=cpT0=const (8.39) If all the streamlines emanate from the same uniform freestream, then Equa- tion (8.39) holds throughout the entire ﬂow, not just along a streamline.CHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 579 For a calorically perfect gas, the ratio of total temperature to static temperature T0/Tis a function of Mach number only, as follows. From Equations (8.38) and (7.9), we have T0 T=1+u2 2cpT=1+u2 2γRT/(γ−1)=1+u2 2a2/(γ−1) =1+γ−1 2/parenleftbiggu a/parenrightbigg2 Hence,T0 T=1+γ−1 2M2(8.40) Equation (8.40) is very important; it states that only M(and, of course, the value ofγ) dictates the ratio of total temperature to static temperature. Recall the deﬁnition of total pressure p0and total density ρ0, as discussed in Section 7.5. These deﬁnitions involve an isentropic compression of the ﬂow to zero velocity. From Equation (7.32), we have p0 p=/parenleftbiggρ0 ρ/parenrightbiggγ =/parenleftbiggT0 T/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) (8.41) Combining Equations (8.40) and (8.41), we obtain p0 p=/parenleftbigg 1+γ−1 2M2/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) ρ0 ρ=/parenleftbigg 1+γ−1 2M2/parenrightbigg1/(γ−1)(8.42) (8.43) Similar to the case of T0/T, we see from Equations (8.42) and (8.43) that the total-to-static ratios p0/pandρ0/ρare determined by Mandγonly. Hence, for a given gas (i.e., given γ), the ratios T0/T,p0/p, andρ0/ρdepend only on Mach number. Equations (8.40), (8.42), and (8.43) are very important; they should be branded on your mind. They provide formulas from which the deﬁned quantities T0,p0, andρ0can be calculated from the actual conditions of M,T,p, andρat a given point in a general ﬂow ﬁeld (assuming a calorically perfect gas). They are so important that values of T0/T,p0/p, andρ0/ρobtained from Equations (8.40), (8.42), and (8.43), respectively, are tabulated as functions of Min Appendix A forγ=1.4 (which corresponds to air at standard conditions). Consider a point in a general ﬂow where the velocity is exactly sonic (i.e., where M=1). Denote the static temperature, pressure, and density at this sonic580 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow condition as T∗,p∗, andρ∗, respectively. Inserting M=1 into Equations (8.40), (8.42), and (8.43), we obtain T∗ T0=2 γ+1 p∗ p0=/parenleftbigg2 γ+1/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) ρ∗ ρ0=/parenleftbigg2 γ+1/parenrightbigg1/(γ−1)(8.44) (8.45) (8.46) Forγ=1.4, these ratios are T∗ T0=0.833p∗ p0=0.528ρ∗ ρ0=0.634 which are useful numbers to keep in mind for subsequent discussions. We have one ﬁnal item of business in this section. In Chapter 1, we deﬁned the Mach number as M=V/a(or, following the one-dimensional notation in this chapter, M=u/a). In turn, this allowed us to deﬁne several regimes of ﬂow, among them being M<1 (subsonic ﬂow) M=1 (sonic ﬂow) M>1 (supersonic ﬂow) In the deﬁnition of M,ais the local speed of sound, a=√γRT. In the theory of supersonic ﬂow, it is sometimes convenient to introduce a “characteristic” Mach number M∗deﬁned as M∗≡u a∗ where a∗is the value of the speed of sound at sonic conditions, notthe actual local value. This is the same a∗introduced at the end of Section 7.5 and used in Equation (8.35). The value of a∗is given by a∗=√γRT∗. Let us now obtain a relation between the actual Mach number Mand this deﬁned characteristic Mach number M∗. Dividing Equation (8.35) by u2, we have (a/u)2 γ−1+1 2=γ+1 2(γ−1)/parenleftbigga∗ u/parenrightbigg2 (1/M)2 γ−1=γ+1 2(γ−1)/parenleftbigg1 M∗/parenrightbigg2 −1 2 M2=2 (γ+1)/M∗2−(γ−1)(8.47)CHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 581 Equation (8.47) gives Mas a function of M∗. Solving Equation (8.47) for M∗2, we have M∗2=(γ+1)M2 2+(γ−1)M2(8.48) which gives M∗as a function of M. As can be shown by inserting numbers into Equation (8.48) (try some yourself), M∗=1 ifM=1 M∗<1 ifM<1 M∗>1 ifM>1 M∗→/radicalBigg γ+1 γ−1ifM→∞ Therefore, M∗acts qualitatively in the same fashion as Mexcept that M∗ approaches a ﬁnite value when the actual Mach number approaches inﬁnity. In summary, a number of equations have been derived in this section, all of which stem in one fashion or another from the basic energy equation for steady, inviscid, adiabatic ﬂow. Make certain that you understand these equations and be-come very familiar with them before progressing further. These equations are piv-otal in the analysis of shock waves and in the study of compressible ﬂow in general. EXAMPLE 8.7 Repeat Example 7.3 using the equations from the present section. ■Solution In Example 8.2, the local Mach number was calculated to be M=2.79. From Equa- tion (8.40), T0 T=1+γ−1 2M2=1+0.4 2(2.79)2=2.557 From Example 7.3, T=320 K. Thus, T0=2.557 T=(2.557)(320) =818 K From Equation (8.42), p0 p=/bracketleftbigg 1+γ−1 2(M)2/bracketrightbiggγ γ−1 =(2.557)1.4 0.4=26.7 From Example 7.3, p=1 atm. Thus, p0=26.7 p=26.7(1) =26.7 atm These answers agree with the results obtained in Example 7.3. The technique used here for calculating T0andp0from the Mach number is, philosophically, more fundamental582 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow than that used in Example 7.3. As we proceed with our discussions, you will ﬁnd that Mach number is the major governing parameter for compressible ﬂow. Note: In this example, we used analytical equations to obtain the answers. For our subsequent examples we will use the tabulations in Appendix A, which are obtained fromthe analytical equations. These tabulations are a convenience that saves us from workingthrough the equations each time. EXAMPLE 8.8 Consider a point in an airﬂow where the local Mach number, static pressure, and statictemperature are 3.5, 0.3 atm, and 180 K, respectively. Calculate the local values of p 0,T0, T∗,a∗, and M∗at this point. ■Solution From Appendix A, for M=3.5, p0/p=76.27 and T0/T=3.45.

EXAMPLE 8.9 In Example 3.1, we illustrated for an incompressible ﬂow, the calculation of the velocity at apoint on an airfoil when we were given the pressure at that point and the freestream velocityand pressure. (It would be useful to review Example 3.1 before going further.) The solutioninvolved the use of Bernoulli’s equation. Let us now examine the compressible ﬂow analogof Example 3.1. Consider an airfoil in a freestream where M ∞=0.6 and p∞=1 atm, asCHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 583 M/H11009 = 0.6 p/H11009 = 1 atm1p1 = 0.7545 atm M1 = ? Figure 8.5 Figure for Example 8.2. sketched in Figure 8.5. At point 1 on the airfoil the pressure is p1=0.7545 atm. Calculate the local Mach number at point 1. Assume isentropic ﬂow over the airfoil. ■Solution We cannot use Bernoulli’s equation because the freestream Mach number is high enough that the ﬂow should be treated as compressible. The free stream total pressure for M∞= 0.6 is, from Appendix A p0,∞=p0,∞ p∞p∞=(1.276)(1) =1.276 atm Recall that for an isentropic ﬂow, the total pressure is constant throughout the ﬂow. Hence, p0,1=p0,∞=1.276 atm orp0,1 p1=1.276 0.7545=1.691 From Appendix A, for a ratio of total to static pressure equal to 1.69, we have M1=0.9 This is the local Mach number at point 1 on the airfoil in Figure 8.5. EXAMPLE 8.10 Note that ﬂow velocity did not enter the calculations in Example 8.9. For compressibleﬂow, Mach number is a more fundamental variable than velocity; we will see this time-and-time again in the subsequent sections and chapters dealing with compressible ﬂow.However, we can certainly calculate velocities for compressible ﬂow problems, but in suchcases we usually need to know something about the temperature level of the ﬂow. For theconditions that prevail in Example 8.9, calculate the velocity at point 1 on the airfoil whenthe free stream temperature is 59 ◦F. ■Solution We will need to deal with consistent units. Since 0◦F is the same as 460◦R, T∞=460+59=519◦R The ﬂow is isentropic, hence, from Equation (7.32) p1 p∞=/parenleftbiggT1 T∞/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1)584 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow or T1=T∞/parenleftbiggp1 p∞/parenrightbigg(γ−1)/γ =519/parenleftbigg0.7545 1/parenrightbigg(1.4−1)/1.4 =478.9◦R From Equation (8.25), the speed of sound at point 1 is a1=/radicalbig γRT1=/radicalbig (1.4)(1716)(478.9) =1072.6 ft/s Hence, V1=M1a1=(0.9)(1072.6) =965.4 ft/s 8.5 WHEN IS A FLOW COMPRESSIBLE? As a corollary to Section 8.4, we are now in a position to examine the question, When does a ﬂow have to be considered compressible, that is, when do we have touse analyses based on Chapters 7 to 14 rather than the incompressible techniquesdiscussed in Chapters 3 to 6? There is no speciﬁc answer to this question; forsubsonic ﬂows, it is a matter of the degree of accuracy desired whether we treat ρ as a constant or as a variable, whereas for supersonic ﬂow the qualitative aspectsof the ﬂow are so different that the density must be treated as variable. We have stated several times in the preceding chapters the rule of thumb that a ﬂow canbe reasonably assumed to be incompressible when M<0.3, whereas it should be considered compressible when M>0.3. There is nothing magic about the value 0.3, but it is a convenient dividing line. We are now in a position to addsubstance to this rule of thumb. Consider a ﬂuid element initially at rest, say, an element of the air around you. The density of this gas at rest is ρ Let us now accelerate this ﬂuid element isentropically to some velocity Vand Mach number M, say, by expanding the air through a nozzle. As the velocity of the ﬂuid element increases, the otherﬂow properties will change according to the basic governing equations derivedin Chapter 7 and in this chapter. In particular, the density ρof the ﬂuid element will change according to Equation (8.43): ρ 0 ρ=/parenleftbigg 1+γ−1 2M2/parenrightbigg1/(γ−1) (8.43) Forγ=1.4, this variation is illustrated in Figure 8.6, where ρ/ρ 0is plotted as a function of Mfrom zero to sonic ﬂow. Note that at low subsonic Mach num- bers, the variation of ρ/ρ 0is relatively ﬂat. Indeed, for M<0.32, the value ofρdeviates from ρ0by less than 5 percent, and for all practical purposes the ﬂow can be treated as incompressible. However, for M>0.32, the variation inρis larger than 5 percent, and its change becomes even more pronounced as Mincreases. As a result, many aerodynamicists have adopted the rule of thumb that the density variation should be accounted for at Mach numbers above 0.3;that is, the ﬂow should be treated as compressible. Of course, keep in mind thatall ﬂows, even at the lowest Mach numbers, are, strictly speaking, compress-ible. Incompressible ﬂow is really a myth. However, as shown in Figure 8.6, theCHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 585 5% variation1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 MFor M < 0.3, the variationin /H9267/H11408/H92670 is less than 5%/H92670/H9267 Figure 8.6 Isentropic variation of density with Mach number. assumption of incompressible ﬂow is very reasonable at low Mach numbers. For this reason, the analyses in Chapters 3 to 6 and the vast bulk of existing literature for incompressible ﬂow are quite practical for many aerodynamic applications. To obtain additional insight into the signiﬁcance of Figure 8.6, let us ask how the ratio ρ/ρ 0affects the change in pressure associated with a given change in ve- locity. The differential relation between pressure and velocity for a compressibleﬂow is given by Euler’s equation, Equation (3.12) repeated below: dp=−ρV dV (3.12) This can be written as dp p=−ρ pV2dV V This equation gives the fractional change in pressure for a given fractional changein velocity for a compressible ﬂow with local density ρ. If we now assume that the density is constant, say, equal to ρ 0as denoted in Figure 8.6, then Equation (3.12) yields /parenleftbiggdp p/parenrightbigg 0=−ρ0 pV2dV V where the subscript zero implies the assumption of constant density. Dividing thelast two equations, and assuming the same dV/Vandp, we have dp/p (dp/p)0=ρ ρ0586 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Hence, the degree by which ρ/ρ 0deviates from unity as shown in Figure 8.6 is related to the same degree by which the fractional pressure change for a given dV/Vis predicted. For example, if ρ/ρ 0=0.95, which occurs at about M=0.3 in Figure 8.5, then the fractional change in pressure for a compressible ﬂow withlocal density ρas compared to that for an incompressible ﬂow with density ρ 0will be about 5 percent different. Keep in mind that the above comparison is for thelocal fractional change in pressure, the actual integrated pressure change is lesssensitive. For example, consider the ﬂow of air through a nozzle starting in thereservoir at nearly zero velocity and standard sea level values of p 0=2116 lb/ft2 andT0=510◦R, and expanding to a velocity of 350 ft/s at the nozzle exit. The pressure at the nozzle exit will be calculated assuming ﬁrst incompressible ﬂowand then compressible ﬂow. Incompressible ﬂow: From Bernoulli’s equation, p=p 0−1 2ρV2=2116−1 2(0.002377)(350)2=1970 lb/ft2 Compressible ﬂow: From the energy equation, Equation (8.30), with cp= 6006[(ft) (lb)/slug◦R] for air, T=T0−V2 2cp=519−(350)2 2(6006)=508.8◦R From Equation (7.32), p p0=/parenleftbiggT T0/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) =/parenleftbigg508.8 519/parenrightbigg3.5 =0.9329 p=0.9329 p0=0.9329(2116) =1974 lb/ft2 Note that the two results are almost the same, with the compressible value of pres- sure only 0.2 percent higher than the incompressible value. Clearly, the assump-tion of incompressible ﬂow (hence, the use of Bernoulli’s equation) is certainlyjustiﬁed in this case. Also, note that the Mach number at the exit is 0.317 (work thisout for yourself). Hence, we have shown that for a ﬂow wherein the Mach numberranges from zero to about 0.3, Bernoulli’s equation yields a reasonably accuratevalue for the pressure—another justiﬁcation for the statement that ﬂows wherein M<0.3 are essentially incompressible ﬂows. On the other hand, if this ﬂow were to continue to expand to a velocity of 900 ft/s, a repeat of the above calculationyields the following results for the static pressure at the end of the expansion: Incompressible (Bernoulli’s equation): p=1153 lb/ft 2 Compressible: p=1300 lb/ft2 Here, the difference between the two sets of results is considerable—a 13 percent difference. In this case, the Mach number at the end of the expansion is 0.86.Clearly, for such values of Mach number, the ﬂow must be treated as compressible.CHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 587 In summary, although it may be somewhat conservative, this author sug- gests on the strength of all the above information, including Figure 8.6, that ﬂows wherein the local Mach number exceeds 0.3 should be treated as compress-ible. Moreover, when M<0.3, the assumption of incompressible ﬂow is quite justiﬁed. 8.6 CALCULATION OF NORMAL SHOCK-WAVE PROPERTIES Consider again the road map given in Figure 8.2. We have ﬁnished our threeside trips (Sections 8.3 to 8.5) and are now ready to get back on the main roadtoward the calculation of changes of ﬂow properties across a normal shock wave.Return again to Section 8.2, and recall the basic normal shock equations given byEquations (8.2), (8.6), and (8.10): Continuity: ρ 1u1=ρ2u2 (8.2) Momentum: p1+ρ1u2 1=p2+ρ2u22 (8.6) Energy: h1+u21 2=h2+u22 2(8.10) In addition, for a calorically perfect gas, we have h2=cpT2 (8.49) p2=ρ2RT2 (8.50) Return again to Figure 8.3, and recall the basic normal shock-wave problem: given the conditions in region 1 ahead of the shock, calculate the conditions in region2 behind the shock. Examining the ﬁve equations given above, we see that theyinvolve ﬁve unknowns, namely, ρ 2,u2,p2,h2, and T2. Hence, Equations (8.2), (8.6), (8.10), (8.49), and (8.50) are sufﬁcient for determining the properties behinda normal shock wave in a calorically perfect gas. Let us proceed. First, dividing Equation (8.6) by (8.2), we obtain p 1 ρ1u1+u1=p2 ρ2u2+u2 p1 ρ1u1−p2 ρ2u2=u2−u1 (8.51) Recalling from Equation (8.23) that a=√γp/ρ, Equation (8.51) becomes a2 1 γu1−a2 2 γu2=u2−u1 (8.52) Equation (8.52) is a combination of the continuity and momentum equations.The energy equation, Equation (8.10), can be used in one of its alternate forms,namely, Equation (8.35), rearranged below, and applied ﬁrst in region 1 and then588 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow in region 2: a2 1=γ+1 2a∗2−γ−1 2u2 1 (8.53) and a2 2=γ+1 2a∗2−γ−1 2u22(8.54) In Equations (8.53) and (8.54), a∗is the same constant value because the ﬂow across the shock wave is adiabatic (see Sections 7.5 and 8.5). Substituting Equa- tions (8.53) and (8.54) into Equation (8.52), we have γ+1 2a∗2 γu1−γ−1 2γu1−γ+1 2a∗2 γu2+γ−1 2γu2=u2−u1 orγ+1 2γu1u2(u2−u1)a∗2+γ−1 2γ(u2−u1)=u2−u1 Dividing by u2−u1, we obtain γ+1 2γu1u2a∗2+γ−1 2γ=1 Solving for a∗, we obtain a∗2=u1u2 (8.55) Equation (8.55) is called the Prandtl relation and is a useful intermediate relation for normal shock waves. For example, from Equation (8.55), 1=u1 a∗u2 a∗(8.56) Recall the deﬁnition of characteristic Mach number, M∗=u/a∗, given in Sec- tion 8.4. Hence, Equation (8.56) becomes 1=M∗ 1M∗ 2 or M∗ 2=1 M∗ 1(8.57) Substituting Equation (8.48) into (8.57), we have (γ+1)M2 2 2+(γ−1)M2 2=/bracketleftbigg(γ+1)M2 1 2+(γ−1)M2 1/bracketrightbigg−1 (8.58) Solving Equation (8.58) for M2 2, we obtain M2 2=1+[(γ−1)/2] M2 1 γM2 1−(γ−1)/2(8.59) Equation (8.59) is our ﬁrst major result for a normal shock wave. Examine Equa-tion (8.59) closely; it states that the Mach number behind the wave M 2is aCHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 589 function only of the Mach number ahead of the wave M1. Moreover, if M1=1, then M2=1. This is the case of an inﬁnitely weak normal shock wave, deﬁned as aMach wave. Furthermore, if M1>1, then M2<1; that is, the Mach num- ber behind the normal shock wave is subsonic. As M1increases above 1, the normal shock wave becomes stronger, and M2becomes progressively less than However, in the limit as M1→∞ ,M2approaches a ﬁnite minimum value, M2→√(γ−1)/2γ , which for air is 0.378. Let us now obtain the ratios of the thermodynamic properties ρ2/ρ1,p2/p1, andT2/T1across a normal shock wave. Rearranging Equation (8.2) and using Equation (8.55), we have ρ2 ρ1=u1 u2=u2 1 u2u1=u2 a∗2=M∗2 1 (8.60) Substituting Equation (8.48) into (8.60), we obtain ρ2 ρ1=u1 u2=(γ+1)M2 1 2+(γ−1)M2 1(8.61) To obtain the pressure ratio, return to the momentum equation, Equation (8.6), combined with the continuity equation, Equation (8.2): p2−p1=ρ1u2 1−ρ2u22=ρ1u1(u1−u2)=ρ1u21/parenleftbigg 1−u2 u1/parenrightbigg (8.62) Dividing Equation (8.62) by p1, and recalling that a2 1=γp1/ρ1, we obtain p2−p1 p1=γρ1u2 1 γp1/parenleftbigg 1−u2 u1/parenrightbigg =γu21 a2 1/parenleftbigg 1−u2 u1/parenrightbigg =γM2 1/parenleftbigg 1−u2 u1/parenrightbigg (8.63) Foru2/u1in Equation (8.63), substitute Equation (8.61): p2−p1 p1=γM2 1/bracketleftbigg 1−2+(γ−1)M2 1 (γ+1)M2 1/bracketrightbigg (8.64) Equation (8.64) simpliﬁes to p2 p1=1+2γ γ+1(M2 1−1) (8.65) To obtain the temperature ratio, recall the equation of state p=ρRT. Hence, T2 T1=/parenleftbiggp2 p1/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggρ1 ρ2/parenrightbigg (8.66) Substituting Equations (8.61) and (8.65) into (8.66), and recalling that h=cpT, we obtain T2 T1=h2 h1=/bracketleftbigg 1+2γ γ+1(M2 1−1)/bracketrightbigg2+(γ−1)M2 1 (γ+1)M2 1(8.67)590 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Equations (8.61), (8.65), and (8.67) are important. Examine them closely. Note that ρ2/ρ1,p2/p1, and T2/T1arefunctions of the upstream Mach number M1only. Therefore, in conjunction with Equation (8.59) for M2, we see that the upstream Mach number M1isthedetermining parameter for changes across a normal shock wave in a calorically perfect gas. This is a dramatic example of the power of the Mach number as a governing parameter in compressible ﬂows. Inthe above equations, if M 1=1, then p2/p1=ρ2/ρ1=T2/T1=1; that is, we have the case of a normal shock wave of vanishing strength—a Mach wave. As M1increases above 1, p2/p1,ρ2/ρ1, and T2/T1progressively increase above 1. In the limiting case of M1→∞ in Equations (8.59), (8.61), (8.65), and (8.67), we ﬁnd, for γ=1.4, lim M1→∞M2=/radicalBigg γ−1 2γ=0.378 (as discussed previously) lim M1→∞ρ2 ρ1=γ+1 γ−1=6 lim M1→∞p2 p1=∞ lim M1→∞T2 T1=∞ Note that, as the upstream Mach number increases toward inﬁnity, the pressureand temperature increase without bound, whereas the density approaches a rathermoderate ﬁnite limit. We have stated earlier that shock waves occur in supersonic ﬂows; a stationary normal shock such as shown in Figure 8.3 does not occur in subsonic ﬂow. Thatis, in Equations (8.59), (8.61), (8.65), and (8.67), the upstream Mach numberis supersonic M 1≥1. However, on a mathematical basis, these equations also allow solutions for M1≤1. These equations embody the continuity, momentum, and energy equations, which in principle do not care whether the value of M1 is subsonic or supersonic. Here is an ambiguity which can only be resolved byappealing to the second law of thermodynamics (see Section 7.2). Recall that thesecond law of thermodynamics determines the direction which a given process can take. Let us apply the second law to the ﬂow across a normal shock wave,and examine what it tells us about allowable values of M First, consider the entropy change across the normal shock wave. From Equa- tion (7.25), s2−s1=cplnT2 T1−Rlnp2 p1(7.25) with Equations (8.65) and (8.67), we have s2−s1=cpln/braceleftbigg/bracketleftbigg 1+2γ γ+1(M2 1−1)/bracketrightbigg2+(γ−1)M2 1 (γ+1)M2 1/bracerightbigg −Rln/bracketleftbigg 1+2γ γ+1(M2 1−1)/bracketrightbigg (8.68)CHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 591 From Equation (8.68), we see that the entropy change s2−s1across the shock is a function of M1only. The second law dictates that s2−s1≥0 In Equation (8.68), if M1=1,s2=s1, and if M1>1, then s2−s1>0, both of which obey the second law. However, if M1<1, then Equation (8.68) gives s2−s1<0, which is notallowed by the second law. Consequently, in nature, only cases involving M1≥1 are valid; that is, normal shock waves can occur only in supersonic ﬂow. Why does the entropy increase across the shock wave? The second law tells us that it must, but what mechanism does nature use to accomplish this increase? To answer these questions, recall that a shock wave is a very thin region (on theorder of 10 −5cm) across which some large changes occur almost discontinuously. Therefore, within the shock wave itself, large gradients in velocity and temperatureoccur; that is, the mechanisms of friction and thermal conduction are strong.These are dissipative, irreversible mechanisms that always increase the entropy.Therefore, the precise entropy increase predicted by Equation (8.68) for a givensupersonic M 1is appropriately provided by nature in the form of friction and thermal conduction within the interior of the shock wave itself. In Section 7.5, we deﬁned the total temperature T0and total pressure p0. What happens to these total conditions across a shock wave? To help answer thisquestion, consider Figure 8.7, which illustrates the deﬁnition of total conditionsahead of and behind the shock. In region 1 ahead of the shock, a ﬂuid element hasthe actual conditions of M 1,p1,T1, and s1. Now imagine that we bring this ﬂuid element to rest isentropically, creating the “imaginary” state 1a ahead of the shock. In state 1 a, the ﬂuid element at rest would have a pressure and temperature p0,1 andT0,1, respectively, that is, the total pressure and total temperature, respectively, Figure 8.7 Total conditions ahead of and behind a normal shock wave.592 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow in region 1. The entropy in state 1 awould still be s1because the ﬂuid element is brought to rest isentropically; s1a=s1. Now consider region 2 behind the shock. Again consider a ﬂuid element with the actual conditions of M2,p2,T2, ands2, as sketched in Figure 8.7. And again let us imagine that we bring this ﬂuid element to rest isentropically, creating the “imaginary” state 2 abehind the shock. In state 2 a, the ﬂuid element at rest would have pressure and temperature p0,2and T0,2, respectively, that is, the total pressure and total temperature, respectively, in region 2. The entropy in state 2 awould still be s2because the ﬂuid element is brought to rest isentropically; s2a=s2. The questions are now asked: How does T0,2compare with T0,1, and how does p0,2compare with p0,1? To answer the ﬁrst of these questions, consider Equation (8.30): cpT1+u2 1 2=cpT2+u22 2(8.30) From Equation (8.38), the total temperature is given by cpT0=cpT+u2 2(8.38) Combining Equations (8.30) and (8.38), we have cpT0,1=cpT0,2 or T0,1=T0,2 (8.69) Equation (8.69) states that total temperature is constant across a stationary nor- mal shock wave. This should come as no surprise; the ﬂow across a shock wave is adiabatic, and in Section 7.5 we demonstrated that in a steady, adiabatic, inviscidﬂow of a calorically perfect gas, the total temperature is constant. To examine the variation of total pressure across a normal shock wave, write Equation (7.25) between the imaginary states 1 aand 2 a: s 2a−s1a=cplnT2a T1a−Rlnp2a p1a(8.70) However, from the above discussion, as well as the sketch in Figure 8.7, we haves 2a=s2,s1a=s1,T2a=T0,2,T1a=T0,1,p2a=p0,2, and p1a=p0,1. Thus, Equation (8.70) becomes s2−s1=cplnT0,2 T0,1−Rlnp0,2 p0,1(8.71) We have already shown that T0,2=T0,1; hence, Equation (8.71) yields s2−s1=− Rlnp0,2 p0,1(8.72) orp0,2 p0,1=e−(s 2−s1)/R(8.73)CHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 593 Figure 8.8 The variation of properties across a normal shock wave as a function of upstream Mach number: γ=1.4. From Equation (8.68), we know that s2−s1>0 for a normal shock wave. Hence, Equation (8.73) states that p0,2<p0,1.The total pressure decreases across a shock wave. Moreover, since s2−s1is a function of M1only [from Equation (8.68)], then Equation (8.73) clearly states that the total pressure ratio p0,2/p0,1across a normal shock wave is a function of M1only. In summary, we have now veriﬁed the qualitative changes across a normal shock wave as sketched in Figure 7.4b and as originally discussed in Section 7.6. Moreover, we have obtained closed-form analytic expressions for these changes in the case of a calorically perfect gas. We have seen that p2/p1,ρ2/ρ1,T2/T1, M2, and p0,2/p0,1are functions of the upstream Mach number M1only. To help you obtain a stronger physical feeling of normal shock-wave properties, thesevariables are plotted in Figure 8.8 as a function of M Note that (as stated earlier) these curves show how, as M1becomes very large, T2/T1andp2/p1also become very large, whereas ρ2/ρ1andM2approach ﬁnite limits. Examine Figure 8.8 carefully, and become comfortable with the trends shown. The results given by Equations (8.59), (8.61), (8.65), (8.67), and (8.73) are so important that they are tabulated as a function of M1in Appendix B for γ=1.4.

Any loss of total pressure reduces the ﬂow’s ability to do useful work. Losses of total pressure reduce the performance of any ﬂow device, and cost money. We will see this time-and-time-again in subsequent chapters.In this example, we see that for a normal shock at Mach 2, the loss of total pressure was2.184 atm, whereas simply by doubling the Mach number to 4, the loss of total pressurewas a whopping 130.7 atm. The moral to this story is that, if you are going to suffer anormal shock wave in a ﬂow, everything else being equal, you want the normal shock tooccur at the lowest possible upstream Mach number. EXAMPLE 8.13 A ramjet engine is an air-breathing propulsion device with essentially no rotating machin-ery (no rotating compressor blades, turbine, etc.). The basic generic parts of a conventionalramjet are sketched in Figure 8.9. The ﬂow, moving from left to right, enters the inlet,where it is compressed and slowed down. The compressed air then enters the combustorat very low subsonic speed, where it is mixed and burned with a fuel. The hot gas thenexpands through a nozzle. The net result is the production of thrust toward the left inFigure 8.9. In this ﬁgure the ramjet is shown in a supersonic freestream with a detachedshock wave ahead of the inlet. The portion of the shock just to the left of point 1 is a normalshock. (A detached normal shock wave in front of the inlet of a ramjet in a supersonic ﬂowis not the ideal operating condition; rather, it is desirable that the ﬂow pass through one ormore oblique shock waves before entering the inlet. Oblique shock waves are discussed M/H11009 > 1 p/H11009 T/H1100912 Inlet Combustor NozzleFlow Figure 8.9 Schematic of a conventional subsonic-combustion ramjet engine.596 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow in Chapter 9.) After passing through the shock wave, the ﬂow from point 1 to point 2, located at the entrance to the combustor, is isentropic. The ramjet is ﬂying at Mach 2 at astandard altitude of 10 km, where the air pressure and temperature are 2 .65×10 4N/m2 and 223.3 K, respectively. Calculate the air temperature and pressure at point 2 when theMach number at that point is 0.2. ■Solution The total pressure and total temperature of the freestream at M∞=2 can be obtained from Appendix A. p0,∞=/parenleftbiggp0,∞ p∞/parenrightbigg p∞=(7.824)(2.65 ×104)=2.07×105N/m2 T0,∞=/parenleftbiggT0,∞ T∞/parenrightbigg T∞=(1.8)(223.3) =401.9K At point 1 behind the normal shock, the total pressure is, from Appendix B, for M∞=2 p0,1=/parenleftbiggp0,1 p0,∞/parenrightbigg p0,∞=(0.7209)(2.07 ×105)=1.49×105N/m2 The total temperature is constant across the shock, hence T0,1=T0,∞=401.9K The ﬂow is isentropic between points 1 and 2, hence p0andT0are constant between these points. Therefore, p0,2=1.49×105N/m2andT0,2=401.9 K. At point 2, where M2=0.2, the ratios of the total-to-static pressure and total-to-static temperature, from Appendix A, are p0,2/p2=1.028 and T0,2/T2=1.008.

In Exam-ple 8.11, we will draw a comparison between this result and the conditions that wouldexist at a much higher freestream Mach number.

Also at point 2, since the ﬂow is isentropic between points 1 and 2, p0,2=p0,1=3.43×106N/m2 T0,2=T0,1=4690 K Hence, p2=/parenleftbiggp2 p0,2/parenrightbigg (p0,2)=3.43×106 1.028=3.34×106N/m2 T2=/parenleftbiggT2 T0,2/parenrightbigg (T0,2)=4690 1.008=4653 K In atmospheres, p2=3.34×106 1.02×105=32.7 atm Compared to the rather benign conditions at point 2 existing for the case treated in Example 8.13, in the present example the air entering the combustor is at a pressure and temperature of 32.7 atm and 4653 K—both extremely severe conditions. The temperatureis so hot that the fuel injected into the combustor will decompose rather than burn, withlittle or no thrust being produced. Moreover, the pressure is so high that the structuraldesign of the combustor would have to be extremely heavy, assuming in the ﬁrst place thatsome special heat-resistant material could be found that could handle the high temperature.In short, a conventional ramjet, where the ﬂow is slowed down to a low subsonic Machnumber before entering the combustor, will not work at high, hypersonic Mach numbers. The solution to this problem is not to slow the ﬂow inside the engine to low subsonicspeeds, but rather to slow it only to a lower but still supersonic speed. In this manner,the temperature and pressure increase inside the engine will be smaller and can be madetolerable. In such a ramjet, the entire ﬂowpath through the engine remains at supersonicspeed, including inside the combustor. This necessitates the injection and mixing of thefuel in a supersonic stream—a challenging technical problem. This type of ramjet, wherethe ﬂow is supersonic throughout, is called a supersonic combustion ramjet—SCRAMjet598 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow for short. SCRAMjets are a current area of intense research and advanced development. In November 2005, for the ﬁrst time in history, a SCRAMjet engine successfully powered ahypersonic ﬂight vehicle, the experimental X-43 shown in Figure 9.31, achieving a Machnumber of almost 10. SCRAMjet engines are the only viable airbreathing power plantsfor hypersonic cruise vehicles. Aspects of SCRAMjet engine design will be discussed inChapter 9. EXAMPLE 8.15 The pressure ratio across a normal shock wave in air is 4.5. What are the Mach numbersin front of and behind the wave?

This is because we were given actual dimensionalquantities such as velocity in meters per second and temperature in kelvins. Just the velocityby itself will not deﬁne a speciﬁc normal shock, nor will the temperature by itself. Weneeded both quantities to deﬁne the speciﬁc shock. Of course, to solve this example, theﬁrst thing we did was to calculate the Mach number from the given u 1andT1. Emphasis is again made that Mach number, not velocity, is the powerful single quantity that speciﬁesa particular normal shock.Anderson-3930659 book August 29, 2016 10:47 600 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow EXAMPLE 8.19 The velocity and temperature behind a normal shock wave are 329 m/s and 1500 K, respectively.

By interpolation, M1=4.45+(0.4245 −0.4238) (0.4245 −0.4236)(4.5−4.45) M1=4.45+0.0389 =4.4898 From Appendix B we note that T2/T1=4.875 at M2=0.4236 and T2/T1=4.788 at M2=0.4245. Interpolating to ﬁnd T2/T1atM2=0.4238, we ﬁnd T2 T1=4.788+0.4245 −0.4238 0.4245 −0.4236(4.875 −4.788) T2 T1=4.788+0.068 =4.856 Thus, T1=T2 T2/T1=1500 4.856=308.9 a1=/radicalbig γRT1=/radicalbig (1.4)(287)(308.9) =352.3 m/s u1=M1a1=(4.489)(352.3) =1,581.5 m/s Note: Once again we see that a single velocity does not specify a normal shock wave. However, a velocity in combination with temperature does specify the normal shock. Incontrast to Example 8.18, where u 1andT1ahead of the shock speciﬁed the shock, we see thatu2andT2behind the shock also are sufﬁcient to specify the shock. EXAMPLE 8.20 Repeat Example 8.19, but use the “nearest entry” in tables rather than interpolating betweenentries. Using the nearest entry is a less accurate calculation than interpolation, but it issimpler and quicker. Compare this less accurate result with the more accurate result fromExample 8.19.CHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 601 ■Solution From Example 8.19, M2=0.4238. The nearest entry in Appendix B is M2=0.4236, which corresponds to M1=4.5 and T2/T1=4.875.

EXAMPLE 8.21 Consider a normal shock with an upstream Mach number of 3.53. Obtain the downstreamMach number by: (a) Using the nearest entry in the tables. (b) Interpolating the tabulated values.(c) Exact analytical calculations.Compare the accuracy of the results. ■Solution (a) The nearest entry in Appendix B is for M1=3.55. For this entry in the tables, M2=0.4492 (b)M1=3.53 lies between the entries for M1=3.5, where M2=0.4512, and M1= 3.55, where M2=0.4492. Interpolating to obtain M2corresponding to M1=3.53, we have M2=0.4492 +(3.55−3.53) (3.55−3.5)(0.4512 −0.4492) M2=0.4492 +0.0008 =0.45 (c) From Equation (8.59), M2 2=1+[γ−1)/2] M2 1 γM2 1−(γ−1)/2=1+0.2(3.53)2 (1.4)(3.53)2−0.2=0.2025602 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Thus, M2=(0.2025)1/2=0.45 Compare the results: (a)M2=0.4492 (nearest entry) (b)M2=0.45 (interpolation) (c)M2=0.45 (exact) Conclusion: For all practical purposes, all three approaches yield almost identical results. 8.6.1 Comment on the Use of Tables to Solve Compressible Flow Problems Appendices A, B, and C provide tables for the convenient calculation of certain problems in compressible ﬂow. Many of the previous worked examples in thischapter illustrate the usefulness of these tables. Even when you are dealing withconditions that do not correspond exactly to a direct entry in the tables, and in prac- tice this is usually the case, simple linear interpolation between lines in the tablegave quite accurate numbers for answers, as the results of Examples 8.19, 8.20,and 8.21 demonstrated. This accuracy is veriﬁed by calculations made with exactanalytical formulas as demonstrated in Example 8.21. Various compressible ﬂowtables have been in existence since the 1940s, and their purpose was, as it is now, toprovide a quick and convenient tool for the solution of various compressible ﬂowproblems. They are particularly convenient when we adopt the method of using thenearest entry in the tables, rather than take the time to interpolate between entries.Examples 8.20 and 8.21 demonstrate that little accuracy is lost by using tablesthat contain many more closely spaced entries than presented in Appendices A,B, and C in this book (limited in length because of space constraints). A classicexample is the compressible ﬂow tables contained in NACA TR-1135 (Refer-ence 115), a “bible” on the desk of most aerodynamicists working in high-speedﬂow. The modern alternative to these tables is, of course, the digital computer into which the analytical equations, such as Equations (8.40), (8.42), (8.43), (8.59),(8.61), and (8.65), can easily be programmed, and the numbers in Appendices A,B, and C can be reproduced on your hand calculator. This is particularly straight-forward if you have an explicit calculation, such as calculating M 2behind a normal shock explicitly from a known value of M1ahead of the shock using Equation (8.59). But return to Equation (8.59) for a moment. What if you are given M2, and you want to ﬁnd M1? This is a not-so-convenient implicit calculation in Equa- tion (8.59), whereas, using the tables, you can immediately go to Appendix B,CHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 603 scan down the column for M2, ﬁnd the given value of M2, and then ﬁnd the corresponding value of M1by reading directly across the page. For our purposes, for the remainder of our discussions on compressible ﬂow in this book, we will frequently use the tables, and we will for simplicity adopt the “nearest entry” method. 8.7 MEASUREMENT OF VELOCITY IN A COMPRESSIBLE FLOW The use of a Pitot tube for measuring the velocity of a low-speed, incompressibleﬂow was discussed in Section 3.4. Before progressing further, return to Sec-tion 3.4, and review the principal aspects of a Pitot tube, as well as the formulasused to obtain the ﬂow velocity from the Pitot pressure, assuming incompressibleﬂow. For low-speed, incompressible ﬂow, we saw in Section 3.4 that the velocity can be obtained from a knowledge of both the total pressure and the static pressureat a point. The total pressure is measured by a Pitot tube, and the static pressureis obtained from a static pressure oriﬁce or by some independent means. Theimportant aspect of Section 3.4 is that the pressure sensed by a Pitot tube, alongwith the static pressure, is all that is necessary to extract the ﬂow velocity foran incompressible ﬂow. In the present section, we see that the same is true for acompressible ﬂow, both subsonic and supersonic, if we consider the Mach numberrather than the velocity. In both subsonic and supersonic compressible ﬂows, aknowledge of the Pitot pressure and the static pressure is sufﬁcient to calculateMach number, although the formulas are different for each Mach-number regime.Let us examine this matter further. 8.7.1 Subsonic Compressible Flow Consider a Pitot tube in a subsonic, compressible ﬂow, as sketched in Figure 8.10 a. As usual, the mouth of the Pitot tube (point b) is a stagnation region. Hence, a ﬂuid element moving along streamline abis brought to rest isentropically at point b. In turn, the pressure sensed at point bis the total pressure of the freestream, p0,1. This is the Pitot pressure read at the end of the tube. If, in addition, we know thefreestream static pressure p 1, then the Mach number in region 1 can be obtained from Equation (8.42), p0,1 p1=/parenleftbigg 1+γ−1 2M2 1/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) (8.42) or solving for M2 1, M2 1=2 γ−1/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbiggp0,1 p1/parenrightbigg(γ−1)/γ −1/bracketrightBigg (8.74)604 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Subsonic flow Supersonic flowPitot pressure is the freestreamtotal pressure p 0,1a c deb Pitot pressure isthe total pressurebehind a normal shock p 0,2 (b)(a) Normal shock wavep1M1 /H11021 1 1 12p1M1 /H11022 1 Figure 8.10 A Pitot tube in (a) subsonic ﬂow and (b) supersonic ﬂow. Clearly, from Equation (8.74), the Pitot pressure p0,1and the static pressure p1 allow the direct calculation of Mach number. The ﬂow velocity can be obtained from Equation (8.74) by recalling that M1=u1/a1. Hence, u2 1=2a2 1 γ−1/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbiggp0,1 p1/parenrightbigg(γ−1)/γ −1/bracketrightBigg (8.75) From Equation (8.75), we see that, unlike incompressible ﬂow, a knowledge of p0,1andp1is not sufﬁcient to obtain u1; we also need the freestream speed of sound, a1. 8.7.2 Supersonic Flow Consider a Pitot tube in a supersonic freestream, as sketched in Figure 8.10b . As usual, the mouth of the Pitot tube (point e) is a stagnation region. Hence, a ﬂuid element moving along streamline cdeis brought to rest at point e. However, because the freestream is supersonic and the Pitot tube presents an obstruction to the ﬂow, there is a strong bow shock wave in front of the tube, much like the pic-ture shown at the left of Figure 8.1 for supersonic ﬂow over a blunt body. Hence,CHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 605 streamline cdecrosses the normal portion of the bow shock. A ﬂuid element mov- ing along streamline cdewill ﬁrst be decelerated nonisentropically to a subsonic velocity at point djust behind the shock. Then it is isentropically compressed to zero velocity at point e. As a result, the pressure at point eisnotthe total pressure of the freestream but rather the total pressure behind a normal shock wave, p 0,2. This is the Pitot pressure read at the end of the tube. Keep in mind that because of the entropy increase across the shock, there is a loss in total pressure acrossthe shock, p 0,2<p0,1. However, knowing p0,2and the freestream static pressure p1is still sufﬁcient to calculate the freestream Mach number M1, as follows: p0,2 p1=p0,2 p2p2 p1(8.76) Here, p0,2/p2is the ratio of total pressure to static pressure in region 2 immedi- ately behind the normal shock, and p2/p1is the static pressure ratio across the shock. From Equation (8.42), p0,2 p2=/parenleftbigg 1+γ−1 2M2 2/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) (8.77) where, from Equation (8.59), M2 2=1+[(γ−1)/2] M2 1 γM2 1−(γ−1)/2(8.78) Also, from Equation (8.65), p2 p1=1+2γ γ+1(M2 1−1) (8.79) Substituting Equation (8.78) into (8.77), and substituting the result as well asEquation (8.79) into Equation (8.76), we obtain, after some algebraic simpliﬁca-tion (see Problem 8.14), p0,2 p1=/parenleftbigg(γ+1)2M2 1 4γM2 1−2(γ−1)/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1)1−γ+2γM2 1 γ+1(8.80) Equation (8.80) is called the Rayleigh Pitot tube formula. It relates the Pitot pres- sure p0,2and the freestream static pressure p1to the freestream Mach number M1. Equation (8.80) gives M1as an implicit function of p0,2/p1and allows the cal- culation of M1from a known p0,2/p1. For convenience in making calculations, the ratio p0,2/p1is tabulated versus M1in Appendix B. EXAMPLE 8.22 A Pitot tube is inserted into an airﬂow where the static pressure is 1 atm. Calculate the ﬂow Mach number when the Pitot tube measures (a)1.276 atm, (b)2.714 atm, (c)12.06 atm.Anderson-3930659 book August 29, 2016 10:47 606 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow ■Solution First, we must assess whether the ﬂow is subsonic or supersonic. At Mach 1, the Pitot tube would measure p0=p/0.528 =1.893 p. Hence, when p0<1.893 atm, the ﬂow is subsonic, and when p0>1.893 atm, the ﬂow is supersonic. (a)Pitot tube measurement =1.276 atm. The ﬂow is subsonic. Hence, the Pitot tube is directly sensing the total pressure of the ﬂow. From Appendix A, for p0/p=1.276, M=0.6 (b)Pitot tube measurement =2.714 atm. The ﬂow is supersonic. Hence, the Pitot tube is sensing the total pressure behind a normal shock wave. From Appendix B, for p0,2/p1=2.714, M1=1.3 (c)Pitot tube measurement =12.06 atm. The ﬂow is supersonic. From Appendix B, forp0,2/p1=12.06, M1=3.0 EXAMPLE 8.23 Consider a hypersonic missile ﬂying at Mach 8 at an altitude of 20,000 ft, where thepressure is 973.3 lb/ft The nose of the missile is blunt and is shaped like that shown at the left of Figure 8.1. Calculate the pressure at the stagnation point on the nose. ■Solution Examining the blunt body shown in Figure 8.1, the streamline that impinges at the stagna-tion point has traversed the normal portion of the bow shock wave. By deﬁnition, V=0 at the stagnation point. Since the ﬂow is isentropic between the shock and the body, thepressure at the stagnation point on the body is the total pressure behind a normal shockwith an upstream Mach number of 8. Let us denote the pressure at the stagnation pointbyp s. Since p0,2is the total pressure behind the normal shock, then ps=p0,2. From Appendix B, for Mach 8, p0,2/p1=82.87. Hence, ps=p0,2=/parenleftbiggp0,2 p1/parenrightbigg (p1)=82.87(973.3) =8.07×104lb/ft2 Since 1 atm =2116 lb/ft2, ps=8.07×104 2116=38.1 atm Note that the pressure at the nose of the missile is quite high—38.1 atm. This is typicalof hypersonic ﬂight at low altitude.Check on the calculation This problem can also be solved by ﬁrst calculating the up- stream total pressure from Appendix A, and then using the total pressure ratio across thenormal shock from Appendix B. From Appendix A for Mach 8, p 0,1/p1=0.9763 ×104.CHAPTER 8Normal Shock Waves and Related Topics 607 Hence, p0,1=/parenleftbiggp0,1 p1/parenrightbigg p1=(0.9763 ×104)973.3 =9.502×106 From Appendix B for Mach 8, p0,2/p0,1=8.8488 ×10−2.

Using the resultsfrom the present chapter for a calorically perfect gas with the ratio ofspeciﬁc heats equal to 1.4, predict the gas temperature at the stagnationpoint of the Apollo at Mach 36 at an altitude where the freestreamtemperature is 300 K. Comment on the validity of your answer. 8.18 The stagnation temperature on the Apollo vehicle at Mach 36 as it enteredthe atmosphere was 11,000 K, a much different value than predicted inProblem 8.17 for the case of a calorically perfect gas with a ratio ofspeciﬁc heats equal to 1.4. The difference is due to chemical reactions thatoccur in air at these high temperatures—dissociation and ionization. Theanalyses in this book assuming a calorically perfect gas with constantspeciﬁc heats are not valid for such chemically reacting ﬂows. However,as an engineering approximation, the calorically perfect gas results aresometimes applied with a lower value of the ratio of speciﬁc heats, aso-called “effective gamma,” in order to try to simulate the effects of hightemperature chemically reacting ﬂows. For the condition stated in thisproblem, calculate the value of the effective gamma necessary to yield atemperature of 11,000 K at the stagnation point. Assume the freestreamtemperature is 300 K. 8.19 Prove that the total pressure is constant throughout an isentropic ﬂow.CHAPTER 9 Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves In the case of air (and the same is true for all gases) the shock wave is extremely thin so that calculations based on one-dimensional ﬂow are still applicable fordetermining the changes in velocity and density on passing through it, evenwhen the rest of the ﬂow system is not limited to one dimension, provided thatonly the velocity component normal to the wave is considered. G. I. Taylor and J. W. Maccoll, 1934 PREVIEW BOX Take a look at Figure 9.1. What you see is the computed wave pattern—both shock and expansionwaves—generated by a generic supersonic transportconﬁguration ﬂying at Mach 1.7 at an altitude of15 km. All these waves are oblique to the ﬂow, in contrast to the normal shock waves discussed in Chap-ter 8. The present chapter is all about oblique shock and expansion waves. The material in this chapter is vital to a funda- mental understanding of supersonic ﬂow. Moreover,it is vital to you if you are interested in designingan economically feasible and environmentally accept-able supersonic transport. The shock waves in Fig-ure 9.1 create the major source of drag (wave drag) onthe airplane, and the waves, when they propagate tothe ground, cause the much discussed “sonic boom.”The material in this chapter is also vital to you ifyou are interested in designing SCRAMjet enginesfor hypersonic airplanes. The performance of suchengines depends in part on the nature of the obliquewave patterns both upstream of and inside the en-gine. The material in this chapter is vital to you ifyou are interested in designing supersonic and hyper-sonic wind tunnels, where the oblique wave patternscreated by models in the tunnel and in the diffuserdownstream of the models affect the performanceof the tunnel. In fact, the material in this chapter isvital to a whole host of applications in supersonicﬂow. By now you get the message—the material in this chapter is simply vital to your study of super-sonic ﬂows. It is the bread and butter of such ﬂows.So lay out the bread, spread it with butter, and consumethis chapter. And on top of everything else, learningabout oblique shock and expansion waves is exciting.I predict that you are going to enjoy this. 613614 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 0.2 /H110020.2 Figure 9.1 Wave pattern on a supersonic transport conﬁguration (without nacelles) at Mach 1.7.

Makino, et al., “Nonaxisymmetrical Fuselage ShapeModiﬁcation for Drag Reduction of Low-Sonic-BoomAirplane,” AIAA Journal, vol. 41, no. 8, August 2003, p. 1415). 9.1 INTRODUCTION In Chapter 8, we discussed normal shock waves, that is, shock waves that make an angle of 90◦with the upstream ﬂow. The behavior of normal shock waves is im- portant; moreover, the study of normal shock waves provides a relatively straight-forward introduction to shock-wave phenomena. However, examining Figure 7.5and the photographs shown in Figure 7.6, we see that, in general, a shock wavewill make an oblique angle with respect to the upstream ﬂow. These are calledoblique shock waves and are the subject of part of this chapter. A normal shock wave is simply a special case of the general family of oblique shocks, namely,the case where the wave angle is 90 ◦. In addition to oblique shock waves, where the pressure increases discon- tinuously across the wave, supersonic ﬂows are also characterized by obliqueexpansion waves, where the pressure decreases continuously across the wave. Let us examine these two types of waves further. Consider a supersonic ﬂow overa wall with a corner at point A, as sketched in Figure 9.2. In Figure 9.2a, theCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 615 1 12 2Oblique shock AM1 > 1M2 < M1 M2 > M1p2 > p1 T2 > T1/H92672 > /H92671 /H92672 < /H92671 T2 < T1p2 < p1p1 /H92671 T1M1 > 1 p1 /H92671 T1 /H9258 A /H9258 (a) Concave corner (b) Convex cornerExpansion fan Figure 9.2 Supersonic ﬂow over a corner. wall is turned upward at the corner through the deﬂection angle θ; that is, the corner is concave. The ﬂow at the wall must be tangent to the wall; hence, the streamline at the wall is also deﬂected upward through the angle θ. The bulk of the gas is above the wall, and in Figure 9.2 a, the streamlines are turned upward, into the main bulk of the ﬂow. Whenever a supersonic ﬂow is “turned into it- self” as shown in Figure 9.2a, an oblique shock wave will occur. The originallyhorizontal streamlines ahead of the wave are uniformly deﬂected in crossing thewave, such that the streamlines behind the wave are parallel to each other andinclined upward at the deﬂection angle θ. Across the wave, the Mach number discontinuously decreases, and the pressure, density, and temperature discontin-uously increase. In contrast, Figure 9.2b shows the case where the wall is turned downward at the corner through the deﬂection angle θ; that is, the corner is con- vex. Again, the ﬂow at the wall must be tangent to the wall; hence, the streamlineat the wall is deﬂected downward through the angle θ. The bulk of the gas is above the wall, and in Figure 9.2b, the streamlines are turned downward, away from the main bulk of the ﬂow. Whenever a supersonic ﬂow is “turned away from itself” as shown in Figure 9.2b, an expansion wave will occur. This expan-sion wave is in the shape of a fan centered at the corner. The fan continuouslyopens in the direction away from the corner, as shown in Figure 9.2b. The origi-nally horizontal streamlines ahead of the expansion wave are deﬂected smoothlyand continuously through the expansion fan such that the streamlines behind thewave are parallel to each other and inclined downward at the deﬂection angle θ. Across the expansion wave, the Mach number increases, and the pressure, tem-perature, and density decrease. Hence, an expansion wave is the direct antithesisof a shock wave. Oblique shock and expansion waves are prevalent in two- and three- dimensional supersonic ﬂows. These waves are inherently two-dimensional innature, in contrast to the one-dimensional normal shock waves discussed in Chap-ter 8. That is, in Figure 9.2a andb, the ﬂow-ﬁeld properties are a function of x andy. The purpose of the present chapter is to determine and study the properties of these oblique waves.616 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow (a) (b)Disturbances cannot work their way upstream.

(a) Subsonic ﬂow. (b) Supersonic ﬂow. What is the physical mechanism that creates waves in a supersonic ﬂow? To address this question, recall our picture of the propagation of a sound wave via molecular collisions, as portrayed in Section 8.3. If a slight disturbance takesplace at some point in a gas, information is transmitted to other points in the gasby sound waves which propagate in all directions away from the source of thedisturbance. Now consider a body in a ﬂow, as sketched in Figure 9.3. The gasmolecules which impact the body surface experience a change in momentum. Inturn, this change is transmitted to neighboring molecules by random molecularcollisions. In this fashion, information about the presence of the body attemptsto be transmitted to the surrounding ﬂow via molecular collisions; that is, theinformation is propagated upstream at approximately the local speed of sound. Ifthe upstream ﬂow is subsonic, as shown in Figure 9.3a, the disturbances have noCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 617 A AVt Vtatat BBCSubsonic V < aSupersonicV > a (a)( b)/H9262 Figure 9.4 Another way of visualizing the propagation of disturbances in (a) subsonic and (b) supersonic ﬂow. problem working their way far upstream, thus giving the incoming ﬂow plenty of time to move out of the way of the body. On the other hand, if the upstream ﬂowis supersonic, as shown in Figure 9.3b, the disturbances cannot work their wayupstream; rather, at some ﬁnite distance from the body, the disturbance wavespile up and coalesce, forming a standing wave in front of the body. Hence, thephysical generation of waves in a supersonic ﬂow—both shock and expansionwaves—is due to the propagation of information via molecular collisions and dueto the fact that such propagation cannot work its way into certain regions of thesupersonic ﬂow. Why are most waves oblique rather than normal to the upstream ﬂow? To answer this question, consider a small source of disturbance moving through astagnant gas. For lack of anything better, let us call this disturbance source a“beeper,” which periodically emits sound. First, consider the beeper moving atsubsonic speed through the gas, as shown in Figure 9.4 a. The speed of the beeper isV, where V<a. At time t=0, the beeper is located at point A; at this point, it emits a sound wave that propagates in all directions at the speed of sound, a. At a later time tthis sound wave has propagated a distance atfrom point Aand is represented by the circle of radius atshown in Figure 9.4a. During the same time, the beeper has moved a distance Vtand is now at point Bin Figure 9.4a. Moreover, during its transit from AtoB, the beeper has emitted several other sound waves, which at time tare represented by the smaller circles in Figure 9.4a. Note that the beeper always stays inside the family of circular sound waves and that the waves continuously move ahead of the beeper. This is because the beeperis traveling at a subsonic speed V<a. In contrast, consider the beeper moving at asupersonic speed V>athrough the gas, as shown in Figure 9.4b. At time t=0, the beeper is located at point A, where it emits a sound wave. At a later time t, this sound wave has propagated a distance atfrom point Aand is represented by the circle of radius atshown in Figure 9.4b. During the same time, the beeper618 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Oblique shock M > 1/H9252/H9262 Figure 9.5 Relation between the oblique shock-wave angle and the Mach angle. has moved a distance Vtto point B. Moreover, during its transit from AtoB, the beeper has emitted several other sound waves, which at time tare represented by the smaller circles in Figure 9.4b. However, in contrast to the subsonic case, the beeper is now constantly outside the family of circular sound waves; that is, it is moving ahead of the wave fronts because V>a. Moreover, something new is happening; these wave fronts form a disturbance envelope given by the straightlineBC, which is tangent to the family of circles. This line of disturbances is deﬁned as a Mach wave. In addition, the angle ABC that the Mach wave makes with respect to the direction of motion of the beeper is deﬁned as the Mach angle μ. From the geometry of Figure 9.4b, we readily ﬁnd that sinμ=at Vt=a V=1 M Thus, the Mach angle is simply determined by the local Mach number as μ=sin−11 M(9.1) Examining Figure 9.4b, the Mach wave, that is, the envelope of disturbances in thesupersonic ﬂow, is clearly oblique to the direction of motion. If the disturbances are stronger than a simple sound wave, then the wave front becomes stronger thana Mach wave, creating an oblique shock wave at an angle βto the freestream, where β>μ . This comparison is shown in Figure 9.5. However, the physical mechanism creating the oblique shock is essentially the same as that describedabove for the Mach wave. Indeed, a Mach wave is a limiting case for obliqueshock (i.e., it is an inﬁnitely weak oblique shock). This ﬁnishes our discussion of the physical source of oblique waves in a supersonic ﬂow. Let us now proceed to develop the equations that allow us tocalculate the change in properties across these oblique waves, ﬁrst for obliqueshock waves, and then for expansion waves. In the process, we follow the roadmap given in Figure 9.6.CHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 619 Source of oblique waves Shock-expansion theory— application to supersonic airfoilsPrandtl-Meyer expansion wavesOblique shock relations Supersonic flow over wedges and cones Shock interactions and reflections Detached shock waves Figure 9.6 Road map for Chapter 9. EXAMPLE 9.1 A supersonic airplane is ﬂying at Mach 2 at an altitude of 16 km. Assume the shock wave pattern from the airplane (see Figure 9.1) quickly coalesces into a Mach wavethat intersects the ground behind the airplane, causing a “sonic boom” to be heard by abystander on the ground. At the instant the sonic boom is heard, how far ahead of thebystander is the airplane? ■Solution Examine Figure 9.7, which shows the airplane at an altitude of 16 km with a Mach wavetrailing behind it.

The angle between the shock wave and the upstream ﬂow direction is deﬁned as the wave angle, denoted byβ. The upstream ﬂow (region 1) is horizontal, with a velocity V1and Mach number M1. The downstream ﬂow (region 2) is inclined upward through the de- ﬂection angle θand has velocity V2and Mach number M2. The upstream velocity V1is split into components tangential and normal to the shock wave, w1andu1, respectively, with the associated tangential and normal Mach numbers Mt,1and Mn,1, respectively. Similarly, the downstream velocity is split into tangential and normal components w2andu2, respectively, with the associated Mach numbers Mt,2andMn,2. Consider the control volume shown by the dashed lines in the upper part of Figure 9.8. Sides aanddare parallel to the shock wave. Segments bandcfollow the upper streamline, and segments eand ffollow the lower streamline. Let us apply the integral form of the conservation equations to this control volume,keeping in mind that we are dealing with a steady, inviscid, adiabatic ﬂow withno body forces. For these assumptions, the continuity equation, Equation (2.48),becomes ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SρV·dS=0 This surface integral evaluated over faces aanddyields −ρ 1u1A1+ρ2u2A2, where A1=A2=area of faces aandd. The faces b,c,e, and fare parallel toCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 621 Figure 9.8 Oblique shock geometry. the velocity, and hence contribute nothing to the surface integral (i.e., V·dS=0 for these faces). Thus, the continuity equation for an oblique shock wave is −ρ 1u1A1+ρ2u2A2=0 or ρ1u1=ρ2u2 (9.2) Keep in mind that u1andu2in Equation (9.2) are normal to the shock wave. The integral form of the momentum equation, Equation (2.64), is a vector equation. Hence, it can be resolved into two components, tangential and normal to the shock wave. First, consider the tangential component, keeping in mind thetype of ﬂow we are considering: ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)w =−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(p dS)tangential (9.3) In Equation (9.3), wis the component of velocity tangential to the wave. Since dSis perpendicular to the control surface, then (pdS)tangential over faces aandd is zero. Also, since the vectors pdSon faces band fare equal and opposite, the pressure integral in Equation (9.3) involves two tangential forces that cancel eachother over faces bandf. The same is true for faces cande. Hence, Equation (9.3) becomes −(ρ 1u1A1)w1+(ρ2u2A2)w2=0 (9.4) Dividing Equation (9.4) by Equation (9.2), we have w1=w2 (9.5) Equation (9.5) is an important result; it states that the tangential component of the ﬂow velocity is constant across an oblique shock.622 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow The normal component of the integral momentum equation is, from Equa- tion (2.64), ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)u=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(pdS)normal (9.6) Here, the pressure integral evaluated over faces aanddyields the net sum −p1A1+p2A2. Once again, the equal and opposite pressure forces on band fcancel, as do those on cande. Hence, Equation (9.6) becomes, for the control volume shown in Figure 9.8, −(ρ 1u1A1)u1+(ρ2u2A2)u2=−(−p1A1+p2A2) Since A1=A2, this becomes p1+ρ1u2 1=p2+ρ2u22 (9.7) Again, note that the only velocities appearing in Equation (9.7) are the components normal to the shock. Finally, consider the integral form of the energy equation, Equation (2.95). For our present case, this can be written as ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Sρ/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg V·dS=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SpV·dS (9.8) Again noting that the ﬂow is tangent to faces b,c,f, and e, and hence V·dS=0 on these faces, Equation (9.8) becomes, for the control volume in Figure 9.6, −ρ 1/parenleftbigg e1+V2 1 2/parenrightbigg u1A1+ρ2/parenleftbigg e2+V2 2 2/parenrightbigg u2A2=−(−p1u1A1+p2u2A2)(9.9) Collecting terms in Equation (9.9), we have −ρ 1u1/parenleftbigg e1+p1 ρ1+V2 1 2/parenrightbigg +ρ2u2/parenleftbigg e2+p2 ρ2+V2 2 2/parenrightbigg =0 or ρ1u1/parenleftbigg h1+V2 1 2/parenrightbigg =ρ2u2/parenleftbigg h2+V2 2 2/parenrightbigg (9.10) Dividing Equation (9.10) by (9.2), we have h1+V2 1 2=h2+V2 2 2(9.11) Since h+V2/2=h0, we have again the familiar result that the total enthalpy is constant across the shock wave. Moreover, for a calorically perfect gas, h0= cpT0; hence, the total temperature is constant across the shock wave. Carrying Equation (9.11) a bit further, note from Figure 9.8 that V2=u2+w2. Also, from Equation (9.5), we know that w1=w2. Hence, V2 1−V2 2=/parenleftbigu2 1+w2 1/parenrightbig−/parenleftbigu22+w2 2/parenrightbig=u21−u22CHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 623 Thus, Equation (9.11) becomes h1+u2 1 2=h2+u22 2(9.12) Let us now gather our results. Look carefully at Equations (9.2), (9.7), and (9.12). They are the continuity, normal momentum, and energy equations, respec- tively, for an oblique shock wave. Note that they involve the normal components only of velocity u1andu2; the tangential component wdoes not appear in these equations. Hence, we deduce that changes across an oblique shock wave are governed only by the component of velocity normal to the wave. Again, look hard at Equations (9.2), (9.7), and (9.12). They are precisely the governing equations for a normal shock wave, as given by Equations (8.2), (8.6), and (8.10). Hence, precisely the same algebra as applied to the normal shockequations in Section 8.6, when applied to Equations (9.2), (9.7), and (9.12), willlead to identical expressions for changes across an oblique shock in terms of thenormal component of the upstream Mach number M n,1. Note that Mn,1=M1sinβ (9.13) Hence, for an oblique shock wave, with Mn,1given by Equation (9.13), we have, from Equations (8.59), (8.61), and (8.65), M2 n,2=1+[(γ−1)/2] M2 n,1 γM2 n,1−(γ−1)/2(9.14) ρ2 ρ1=(γ+1)M2 n,1 2+(γ−1)M2 n,1(9.15) p2 p1=1+2γ γ+1(M2 n,1−1) (9.16) The temperature ratio T2/T1follows from the equation of state: T2 T1=p2 p1ρ1 ρ2(9.17) Note that Mn,2is the normal Mach number behind the shock wave. The down- stream Mach number itself, M2, can be found from Mn,2and the geometry of Figure 9.8 as M2=Mn,2 sin(β−θ)(9.18) Examine Equations (9.14) to (9.17). They state that oblique shock-wave prop- erties in a calorically perfect gas depend only on the normal component of theupstream Mach number M n,1. However, note from Equation (9.13) that Mn,1 depends on both M1andβ. Recall from Section 8.6 that changes across a nor- mal shock wave depend on one parameter only—the upstream Mach number M1.624 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow In contrast, we now see that changes across an oblique shock wave depend on two parameters—say, M1andβ. However, this distinction is slightly moot because in reality a normal shock wave is a special case of oblique shocks where β=π/2. Equation (9.18) introduces the deﬂection angle θinto our oblique shock analysis; we need θto be able to calculate M2. However, θis not an independent, third parameter; rather, θis a function of M1andβ, as derived below. From the geometry of Figure 9.8, tanβ=u1 w1(9.19) and tan(β−θ)=u2 w2(9.20) Dividing Equation (9.20) by (9.19), recalling that w1=w2, and invoking the continuity equation, Equation (9.2), we obtain tan(β−θ) tanβ=u2 u1=ρ1 ρ2(9.21) Combining Equation (9.21) with Equations (9.13) and (9.15), we obtain tan(β−θ) tanβ=2+(γ−1)M2 1sin2β (γ+1)M2 1sin2β(9.22) which gives θas an implicit function of M1andβ. After some trigonometric substitutions and rearrangement, Equation (9.22) can be cast explicitly for θas tanθ=2 cotβM2 1sin2β−1 M2 1(γ+cos 2β) +2(9.23) Equation (9.23) is an important equation. It is called the θ-β-Mrelation, and it speciﬁes θas a unique function of M1andβ. This relation is vital to the analysis of oblique shock waves, and results from it are plotted in Figure 9.9 for γ=1.4. Examine this ﬁgure closely. It is a plot of wave angle versus deﬂection angle, withthe Mach number as a parameter. The results given in Figure 9.9 are plotted insome detail—this is a chart which you will need to use for solving oblique shockproblems. Figure 9.9 illustrates a wealth of physical phenomena associated with oblique shock waves. For example: 1.For any given upstream Mach number M 1, there is a maximum deﬂection angleθmax. If the physical geometry is such that θ>θ max, then no solution exists for a straight oblique shock wave. Instead, nature establishes a curved shock wave, detached from the corner or the nose of a body. This is illustrated in Figure 9.10. Here, the left side of the ﬁgure illustrates ﬂowover a wedge and a concave corner where the deﬂection angle is less thanθ maxfor the given upstream Mach number. Therefore, we see a straight oblique shock wave attached to the nose of the wedge and to the corner. Theright side of Figure 9.10 gives the case where the deﬂection angle is greaterCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 625 (a) Figure 9.9 Oblique shock properties: γ=1.4. The θ-β-Mdiagram.

Instead, we have a curved shock wave detached from the nose of the wedge or from the corner. Return toFigure 9.9, and note that the value of θ maxincreases with increasing M1. Hence, at higher Mach numbers, the straight oblique shock solution canexist at higher deﬂection angles. However, there is a limit; as M 1 approaches inﬁnity, θmaxapproaches 45.5◦(forγ=1.4). 2.For any given θless than θmax, there are twostraight oblique shock solutions for a given upstream Mach number. For example, if M1=2.0 and θ=15◦, then from Figure 9.9, βcan equal either 45.3 or 79.8◦. The smaller value of βis called the weak shock solution, and the larger value of βis thestrong shock solution. These two cases are illustrated in Figure 9.11.628 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow The classiﬁcations “weak” and “strong” derive from the fact that for a given M1,the larger the wave angle, the larger the normal component of upstream Mach number Mn,1,and from Equation (9.16) the larger the pressure ratio p2/p1.Thus, in Figure 9.11, the higher-angle shock wave will compress the gas more than the lower-angle shock wave, hence the terms “strong” and “weak” solutions. In nature, the weak shock solution usually prevails.Whenever you see straight, attached oblique shock waves, such as sketchedat the left of Figure 9.10, they are almost always the weak shock solution. Itis safe to make this assumption, unless you have speciﬁc information to thecontrary. Note in Figure 9.9 that the locus of points connecting all thevalues of θ max(the curve that sweeps approximately horizontally across the middle of Figure 9.9) divides the weak and strong shock solutions. Abovethis curve, the strong shock solution prevails (as further indicated by theθ-β-Mcurves being dashed); below this curve, the weak shock solution prevails (where the θ-β-Mcurves are shown as solid lines). Note that slightly below this curve is another curve which also sweeps approximatelyhorizontally across Figure 9.9. This curve is the dividing line above which M 2<1 and below which M2>1. For the strong shock solution, the downstream Mach number is always subsonic M2<1. For the weak shock solution very near θmax, the downstream Mach number is also subsonic, but barely so. For the vast majority of cases involving the weak shock solution,the downstream Mach number is supersonic M 2>1. Since the weak shock solution is almost always the case encountered in nature, we can readilystate that the Mach number downstream of a straight, attached obliqueshock is almost always supersonic. 3.Ifθ=0, then βequals either 90 ◦orμ. The case of β=90◦corresponds to a normal shock wave (i.e., the normal shocks discussed in Chapter 8 belongto the family of strong shock solutions). The case of β=μcorresponds to the Mach wave illustrated in Figure 9.4b. In both cases, the ﬂow streamlinesexperience no deﬂection across the wave. 4.(In all of the following discussions, we consider the weak shock solutionexclusively, unless otherwise noted.) Consider an experiment where wehave supersonic ﬂow over a wedge of given semiangle θ, as sketched in Figure 9.12. Now assume that we increase the freestream Mach number M AsM1increases, we observe that βdecreases. For example, consider θ=20◦andM1=2.0, as shown on the left of Figure 9.12. From Figure 9.9, we ﬁnd that β=53.3◦. Now assume M1is increased to 5, keeping θconstant at 20◦, as sketched on the right of Figure 9.12. Here, we ﬁnd that β=29.9◦. Interestingly enough, although this shock is at a lower wave angle, it is a stronger shock than the one on the left. This is because Mn,1is larger for the case on the right. Although βis smaller, which decreases Mn,1, the upstream Mach number M1is larger, which increases Mn,1by an amount which more than compensates for the decreased β. For example, note the values of Mn,1andp2/p1given in Figure 9.12. Clearly,CHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 629 M1 = 2.0 /H9258 = 20/H9252 = 53.3 Mn1 = 1.60 p2/p1 = 2.82M1 = 5.0 /H9258 = 20 Mn1 = 2.49 p2/p1 = 7.07/H9252 = 29.9 Figure 9.12 Effects of increasing the upstream Mach number. M = 2.0 /H9258 = 20/H9252 = 53 Mn1 = 1.6 p2/p1 = 2.8M1 = 2.0/H9258 = 10 Mn1 = 1.26 p2/p1 = 1.69/H9252 = 39.2 Figure 9.13 Effect of increasing the deﬂection angle. the Mach 5 case on the right yields the stronger shock wave. Hence, in general for attached shocks with a ﬁxed deﬂection angle, as the upstreamMach number M 1increases, the wave angle βdecreases, and the shock wave becomes stronger. Going in the other direction, as M1decreases, the wave angle increases, and the shock becomes weaker. Finally, if M1is decreased enough, the shock wave will become detached. For the case ofθ=20 ◦shown in Figure 9.12, the shock will be detached for M1<1.84. 5.Consider another experiment. Here, let us keep M1ﬁxed and increase the deﬂection angle. For example, consider the supersonic ﬂow over a wedgeshown in Figure 9.13. Assume that we have M 1=2.0 and θ=10◦, as sketched at the left of Figure 9.13. The wave angle will be 39.2◦(from Figure 9.9). Now assume that the wedge is hinged so that we can increaseits deﬂection angle, keeping M 1constant. In such a case, the wave angle will increase, as shown on the right of Figure 9.13. Also, Mn,1will increase,630 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow and hence the shock will become stronger. Therefore, in general for attached shocks with a ﬁxed upstream Mach number, as the deﬂection angleincreases, the wave angle βincreases, and the shock becomes stronger. However, once θexceeds θ max, the shock wave will become detached. For the case of M1=2.0 in Figure 9.13, this will occur when θ> 23◦. The physical properties of oblique shocks just discussed are very important. Before proceeding further, make certain to go over this discussion several timesuntil you feel perfectly comfortable with these physical variations. EXAMPLE 9.2 Consider a supersonic ﬂow with M=2,p=1 atm, and T=288 K. This ﬂow is deﬂected at a compression corner through 20◦. Calculate M,p,T,p0, and T0behind the resulting oblique shock wave. ■Solution From Figure 9.9, for M1=2 and θ=20◦,β=53.4◦. Hence, Mn,1=M1sinβ= 2 sin 53.4◦=1.606. From Appendix B, for Mn,1=1.60 (rounded to the nearest table entry), Mn,2=0.6684p2 p1=2.82T2 T1=1.388p0,2 p0,1=0.8952 Hence, M2=Mn,2 sin(β−θ)=0.6684 sin(53.4 −20)=1.21 p2=p2 p1p1=2.82(1 atm) =2.82 atm T2=T2 T1T1=1.388(288) =399.7 K ForM1=2, from Appendix A, p0,1/p1=7.824 and T0,1/T1=1.8; thus, p0,2=p0,2 p0,1p0,1 p1p1=0.8952(7.824)(1 atm) =7.00 atm The total temperature is constant across the shock. Hence, T0,2=T0,1=T0,1 T1T1=1.8(288) =518.4 K Note: For oblique shocks, the entry for p0,2/p1in Appendix B cannot be used to obtain p0,2; this entry in Appendix B is for normal shocks only and is obtained directly from Equation (8.80). In turn, Equation (8.80) is derived using (8.77),where M 2is the actual ﬂow Mach number, not the normal component. Only in the case of a normal shock is this also the Mach number normal to the wave. Hence,Equation (8.80) holds only for normal shocks; it cannot be used for oblique shocks with M 1replaced by Mn,1. For example, an incorrect calculation would be to useCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 631 p0,2/p1=3.805 for Mn,1=1.60. This gives p0,2=3.805 atm, a totally incorrect result compared with the correct value of 7.00 atm obtained above. EXAMPLE 9.3 Consider an oblique shock wave with a wave angle of 30◦. The upstream ﬂow Mach number is 2.4. Calculate the deﬂection angle of the ﬂow, the pressure and temperature ratios across the shock wave, and the Mach number behind the wave. ■Solution From Figure 9.9, for M1=2.4 and β=30◦, we have θ=6.5◦. Also, Mn,1=M1sinβ=2.4 sin 30◦=1.2 From Appendix B,p2 p1=1.513 T2 T1=1.128 Mn,2=0.8422 Thus, M2=Mn,2 sin(β−θ)=0.8422 sin(30 −6.5)=2.11 Note: Two aspects are illustrated by this example: 1.This is a fairly weak shock wave—only a 51 percent increase in pressure across the wave. Indeed, examining Figure 9.9, we ﬁnd that this case is closeto that of a Mach wave, where μ=sin −1(1/M)=sin−1(1 2.4)=24.6◦. The shock-wave angle of 30◦is not much larger than μ; the deﬂection angle of 6.5◦is also small—consistent with the relative weakness of the shock wave. 2.Only two properties need to be speciﬁed in order to deﬁne uniquely a givenoblique shock wave. In this example, M 1andβwere those two properties. In Example 9.2, the speciﬁed M1andθwere the two properties. Once any two properties about the oblique shock are speciﬁed, the shock is uniquelydeﬁned. This is analogous to the case of a normal shock wave studied inChapter 8. There, we proved that all the changes across a normal shockwave were uniquely deﬁned by specifying only oneproperty, such as M However, implicit in all of Chapter 8 was an additional property, namely,the wave angle of a normal shock wave is 90 ◦. Of course, a normal shock is simply one example of the whole spectrum of oblique shocks, namely, ashock with β=90 ◦. An examination of Figure 9.9 shows that the normal shock belongs to the family of strong shock solutions, as discussedearlier.632 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow EXAMPLE 9.4 Consider an oblique shock wave with β=35◦and a pressure ratio p2/p1=3. Calculate the upstream Mach number. ■Solution From Appendix B, for p2/p1=3,Mn,1=1.64 (nearest entry). Since Mn,1=M1sinβ then M1=Mn,1 sinβ=1.66 sin 35◦=2.86 Note: Once again, the oblique shock is uniquely deﬁned by two properties, in this case β andp2/p1. EXAMPLE 9.5 Consider a Mach 3 ﬂow. It is desired to slow this ﬂow to a subsonic speed. Consider two separate ways of achieving this: (1) the Mach 3 ﬂow is slowed by passing directly througha normal shock wave; (2) the Mach 3 ﬂow ﬁrst passes through an oblique shock witha 40 ◦wave angle, and then subsequently through a normal shock. These two cases are sketched in Figure 9.14. Calculate the ratio of the ﬁnal total pressure values for the twocases, that is, the total pressure behind the normal shock for case 2 divided by the totalpressure behind the normal shock for case 1. Comment on the signiﬁcance of the result. Figure 9.14 Illustration for Example 9.4.CHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 633 ■Solution For case 1, at M=3, we have, from Appendix B, /parenleftbiggp02 p01/parenrightbigg case 1=0.3283 For case 2, we have Mn,1=M1sinβ=3 sin 40◦=1.93. From Appendix B, p02 p01=0.7535 and Mn,2=0.588 From Figure 9.9, for M1=3 andβ=40◦, we have the deﬂection angle θ=22◦. Hence, M2=Mn,2 sin(β−θ)=0.588 sin(40 −22)=1.90 From Appendix B, for a normal shock with an upstream Mach number of 1.9, we have p03/p02=0.7674. Thus, for case 2, /parenleftbiggp03 p01/parenrightbigg case 2=/parenleftbiggp02 p01/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggp03 p02/parenrightbigg =(0.7535)(0.7674) =0.578 Hence,/parenleftbiggp03 p01/parenrightbigg case 2/slashbigg/parenleftbiggp02 p01/parenrightbigg case 1=0.578 0.3283=1.76 The result of Example 9.5 shows that the ﬁnal total pressure is 76 percent higher for the case of the multiple shock system (case 2) in comparison to the single normal shock (case 1). In principle, the total pressure is an indicator of howmuch useful work can be done by the gas; this is described later in Section 10.4.Everything else being equal, the higher the total pressure, the more useful isthe ﬂow. Indeed, losses of total pressure are an index of the efﬁciency of a ﬂuid ﬂow—the lower the total pressure loss, the more efﬁcient is the ﬂow process.In this example, case 2 is more efﬁcient in slowing the ﬂow to subsonic speedsthan case 1 because the loss in total pressure across the multiple shock systemof case 2 is actually less than that for case 1 with a single, strong, normal shockwave. The physical reason for this is straightforward. The loss in total pressureacross a normal shock wave becomes particularly severe as the upstream Machnumber increases; a glance at the p 0,2/p0,1column in Appendix B attests to this. If the Mach number of a ﬂow can be reduced before passing through a normal shock, the loss in total pressure is much less because the normal shock is weaker.This is the function of the oblique shock in case 2, namely, to reduce the Machnumber of the ﬂow before passing through the normal shock. Although there isa total pressure loss across the oblique shock also, it is much less than across anormal shock at the same upstream Mach number. The net effect of the obliqueshock reducing the ﬂow Mach number before passing through the normal shockmore than makes up for the total pressure loss across the oblique shock, with thebeneﬁcial result that the multiple shock system in case 2 produces a smaller loss in total pressure than a single normal shock at the same freestream Mach number.634 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Oblique shock(a) Normal shock inlet Weak normal shockNormal shock (b) Oblique shock inletM/H11009 > 1 M/H11009 > 1 Figure 9.15 Illustration of (a) normal shock inlet and (b) oblique shock inlet. A practical application of these results is in the design of supersonic inlets for jet engines. A normal shock inlet is sketched in Figure 9.15a. Here, a normal shock forms ahead of the inlet, with an attendant large loss in total pressure.In contrast, an oblique shock inlet is sketched in Figure 9.15b. Here, a centralcone creates an oblique shock wave, and the ﬂow subsequently passes through arelatively weak normal shock at the lip of the inlet. For the same ﬂight conditions(Mach number and altitude), the total pressure loss for the oblique shock inletis less than for a normal shock inlet. Hence, everything else being equal, theresulting engine thrust will be higher for the oblique shock inlet. This, of course,is why most modern supersonic aircraft have oblique shock inlets. 9.3 SUPERSONIC FLOW OVER WEDGES AND CONES For the supersonic ﬂow over wedges, as shown in Figures 9.12 and 9.13, theoblique shock theory developed in Section 9.2 is an exact solution of the ﬂow ﬁeld; no simplifying assumptions have been made. Supersonic ﬂow over a wedgeCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 635 Figure 9.16 Relation between wedge and cone ﬂow; illustration of the three-dimensional relieving effect. is characterized by an attached, straight oblique shock wave from the nose, a uniform ﬂow downstream of the shock with streamlines parallel to the wedgesurface, and a surface pressure equal to the static pressure behind the obliqueshock p These properties are summarized in Figure 9.16a. Note that the wedge is a two-dimensional proﬁle; in Figure 9.16a, it is a section of a body that stretchesto plus or minus inﬁnity in the direction perpendicular to the page. Hence, wedgeﬂow is, by deﬁnition, two-dimensional ﬂow, and our two-dimensional obliqueshock theory ﬁts this case nicely. In contrast, consider the supersonic ﬂow over a cone, as sketched in Fig- ure 9.16b. There is a straight oblique shock which emanates from the tip, just asin the case of a wedge, but the similarity stops there. Recall from Chapter 6 thatﬂow over a three-dimensional body experiences a “three-dimensional relievingeffect.” That is, in comparing the wedge and cone in Figure 9.16, both with thesame 20 ◦angle, the ﬂow over the cone has an extra dimension in which to move, and hence it more easily adjusts to the presence of the conical body in compar-ison to the two-dimensional wedge. One consequence of this three-dimensionalrelieving effect is that the shock wave on the cone is weaker than on the wedge;that is, it has a smaller wave angle, as compared in Figure 9.16. Speciﬁcally, thewave angles for the wedge and cone are 53.3 and 37 ◦, respectively, for the same body angle of 20◦and the same upstream Mach number of 2.0. In the case of the wedge (Figure 9.16a), the streamlines are deﬂected by exactly 20◦through the shock wave, and hence downstream of the shock the ﬂow is exactly parallelto the wedge surface. In contrast, because of the weaker shock on the cone, thestreamlines are deﬂected by only 8 ◦through the shock, as shown in Figure 9.16b. Therefore, between the shock wave and the cone surface, the streamlines mustgradually curve upward in order to accommodate the 20 ◦cone. Also, as a con- sequence of the three-dimensional relieving effect, the pressure on the surfaceof the cone, p c, is less than the wedge surface pressure p2, and the cone surface636 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Mach number Mcis greater than that on the wedge surface M2. In short, the main differences between the supersonic ﬂow over a cone and wedge, both with the same body angle, are that (1) the shock wave on the cone is weaker, (2) the conesurface pressure is less, and (3) the streamlines above the cone surface are curvedrather than straight. The analysis of the supersonic ﬂow over a cone is more sophisticated than the oblique shock theory given in this chapter. The calculation of the supersonicﬂow over a cone is discussed in Section 13.6. For details concerning supersonicconical ﬂow analysis, see Chapter 10 of Reference 21. However, it is importantfor you to recognize that conical ﬂows are inherently different from wedge ﬂowsand to recognize in what manner they differ. This has been the purpose of thepresent section. EXAMPLE 9.6 Consider a wedge with a 15◦half angle in a Mach 5 ﬂow, as sketched in Figure 9.17. Calculate the drag coefﬁcient for this wedge. (Assume that the pressure over the base is equal to freestream static pressure, as shown in Figure 9.17.) Figure 9.17 Illustration for Example 9.6.CHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 637 ■Solution Consider the drag on a unit span of the wedge D/prime. Hence, cd=D/prime q1S=D/prime q1c(1)=D/prime q1c From Figure 9.17, D/prime=2p2lsinθ−2p1lsinθ=(2lsinθ)(p2−p1) However, l=c cosθ Thus, D/prime=(2ctanθ)(p2−p1) and cd=(2 tanθ)/parenleftbiggp2−p1 q1/parenrightbigg Note that q1≡1 2ρ1V2 1=1 2ρ1γp1 γp1V2 1=γp1 2a2 1V2 1=γ 2p1M2 1 Thus, cd=(2 tanθ)/parenleftbiggp2−p1 (γ/2) p1M2 1/parenrightbigg =4 tanθ γM2 1/parenleftbiggp2 p1−1/parenrightbigg From Figure 9.9, for M1=5 andθ=15◦,β=24.2◦. Hence, Mn,1=M1sinβ=5 sin(24.2◦)=2.05 From Appendix B, for Mn,1=2.05, we have p2 p1=4.736 Hence, cd=4 tanθ γM2 1/parenleftbiggp2 p1−1/parenrightbigg =4 tan 15◦ (1.4)(5)2(4.736 −1)=0.114 (Note: The drag is ﬁnite for this case. In a supersonic or hypersonic inviscid ﬂow over a two-dimensional body, the drag is always ﬁnite. D’Alembert’s paradox does nothold for freestream Mach numbers such that shock waves appear in the ﬂow. The fundamental reason for the generation of drag here is the presence ofshock waves. Shocks are always a dissipative, drag-producing mechanism. Forthis reason, the drag in this case is called wave drag, andc dis the wave-drag coefﬁcient, more properly denoted as cd,w.) 9.3.1 A Comment on Supersonic Lift and Drag Coefﬁcients The result obtained in Example 9.6 is a stunning veriﬁcation of the validity of thedimensional analysis discussed in Section 1.7. There we proved that, for a body ofa given shape at a given angle of attack, the aerodynamic coefﬁcients are simplya function of Mach number and Reynolds number [see Equations (1.42), (1.43),638 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow and (1.44)]. Consider the 15◦half-angle wedge at zero angle of attack shown in Figure 9.17. This is a body of a given shape at a given angle of attack. Moreover, in Example 9.6 we are given only the freestream Mach number, and are asked to calculate the drag coefﬁcient for the wedge. Since the ﬂow is inviscid, theReynolds number does not play a role. At ﬁrst glance, one might intuitively thinkthat we need to be given at least a freestream pressure and velocity to obtain thedrag coefﬁcient. After all, the physical source of the drag is the pressure distri-bution integrated all over the surface of the body, as emphasized in Section 1.5.And the surface pressure distribution is shown schematically in Figure 9.17. Whyis it, then, that we are not given some information about the pressure level andthe freestream velocity? The answer, clearly demonstrated by the dimensional analysis in Section 1.7, is that the drag coefﬁcient depends just on Mach number. In Example 9.6 the freestream Mach number is given as Mach 5. The solution progresses by treatingthe surface pressure distribution that is responsible for the drag, but the solutionultimately requires only pressure ratios, not the actual value of the pressure it-self. At the end of the calculation in Example 9.6, the drag coefﬁcient is ﬁnallyobtained, and all we needed for the calculation was the freestream Mach number.What a nice veriﬁcation of the validity of the dimensional analysis discussed inSection 1.7 and the concept of ﬂow similarity given in Section 1.8! Moreover,we have veriﬁed these concepts for a supersonic ﬂow. Of course, the conceptsin Sections 1.7 and 1.8 are fundamental; they hold no matter what is the ﬂowregime—subsonic, supersonic, hypersonic, etc. Finally, if we had been asked for the drag force in Example 9.6, additional information would have been required, such as the size of the wedge, and thepressure of the freestream. But one of the beauties of dealing with the aerodynamiccoefﬁcients rather than the forces or moments themselves is that the coefﬁcients for an inviscid ﬂow depend on Mach number, and Mach number only. 9.4 SHOCK INTERACTIONS AND REFLECTIONS Return to the oblique shock wave illustrated in Figure 9.2a. In this picture, wecan imagine the shock wave extending unchanged above the corner to inﬁnity.However, in real life this does not happen. In reality, the oblique shock in Fig-ure 9.2a will impinge somewhere on another solid surface and/or will intersect other waves, either shock or expansion waves. Such wave intersections and inter-actions are important in the practical design and analysis of supersonic airplanes,missiles, wind tunnels, rocket engines, etc. A perfect historical example of this,as well as the consequences that can be caused by not paying suitable attentionto wave interactions, is a ramjet ﬂight-test program conducted in the early 1960s.During this period, a ramjet engine was mounted underneath the X-15 hypersonicairplane for a series of ﬂight tests at high Mach numbers, in the range from 4 to7. (The X-15, shown in Figure 9.18, was an experimental, rocket-powered air-plane designed to probe the lower end of hypersonic manned ﬂight.) During theCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 639 Figure 9.18 The X-15 hypersonic research vehicle. Designed and built during the late 1950s, it served as a test vehicle for the U.S. Air Force and NASA. (NASA). ﬁrst high-speed tests, the shock wave from the engine cowling impinged on the bottom surface of the X-15, and because of locally high aerodynamic heating inthe impingement region, a hole was burned in the X-15 fuselage. Although thisproblem was later ﬁxed, it is a graphic example of what shock-wave interactionscan do to a practical conﬁguration. The purpose of this section is to present a mainly qualitative discussion of shock-wave interactions. For more details, see Chapter 4 of Reference 21. First, consider an oblique shock wave generated by a concave corner, as shown in Figure 9.19. The deﬂection angle at the corner is θ, thus generating an oblique shock at point Awith a wave angle β Assume that a straight, horizontal wall is present above the corner, as also shown in Figure 9.19. The shock wavegenerated at point A, called the incident shock wave, impinges on the upper wall at point B.Question: Does the shock wave simply disappear at point B? If not, what happens to it? To answer this question, we appeal to our knowledge ofshock-wave properties. Examining Figure 9.19, we see that the ﬂow in region 2behind the incident shock is inclined upward at the deﬂection angle θ. However, the ﬂow must be tangent everywhere along the upper wall; if the ﬂow in region 2were to continue unchanged, it would run into the wall and have no place to go.Hence, the ﬂow in region 2 must eventually be bent downward through the angle θ in order to maintain a ﬂow tangent to the upper wall. Nature accomplishes this640 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow /H92521 /H9258/H9258 /H9021 /H9258/H92521Streamline 123B AM1M2Reflected shock Incident shock Figure 9.19 Regular reﬂection of a shock wave from a solid boundary. downward deﬂection via a second shock wave originating at the impingement point Bin Figure 9.19. This second shock is called the reﬂected shock wave. The purpose of the reﬂected shock is to deﬂect the ﬂow in region 2 so thatit is parallel to the upper wall in region 3, thus preserving the wall boundarycondition. The strength of the reﬂected shock wave is weaker than the incident shock. This is because M 2<M1, and M2represents the upstream Mach number for the reﬂected shock wave. Since the deﬂection angles are the same, whereas thereﬂected shock sees a lower upstream Mach number, we know from Section 9.2that the reﬂected wave must be weaker. For this reason, the angle the reﬂectedshock makes with the upper wall /Phi1is not equal to β 1(i.e., the wave reﬂection is not specular). The properties of the reﬂected shock are uniquely deﬁned by M2 andθ; since M2is in turn uniquely deﬁned by M1andθ, then the properties in region 3 behind the reﬂected shock as well as the angle /Phi1are easily determined from the given conditions of M1andθby using the results of Section 9.2 as follows: 1.Calculate the properties in region 2 from the given M1andθ. In particular, this gives us M2. 2.Calculate the properties in region 3 from the value of M2calculated above and the known deﬂection angle θ. An interesting situation can arise as follows. Assume that M1is only slightly above the minimum Mach number necessary for a straight, attached shock wave at the given deﬂection angle θ. For this case, the oblique shock theory from Section 9.2 allows a solution for a straight, attached incident shock. However,we know that the Mach number decreases across a shock (i.e., M 2<M1). This decrease may be enough such that M2isnotabove the minimum MachCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 641 /H9258 Figure 9.20 Mach reﬂection. number for the required deﬂection θthrough the reﬂected shock. In such a case, our oblique shock theory does not allow a solution for a straight reﬂected shock wave. The regular reﬂection as shown in Figure 9.19 is not possible. Na-ture handles this situation by creating the wave pattern shown in Figure 9.20.Here, the originally straight incident shock becomes curved as it nears the up-per wall and becomes a normal shock wave at the upper wall. This allows thestreamline at the wall to continue parallel to the wall behind the shock inter-section. In addition, a curved reﬂected shock branches from the normal shockand propagates downstream. This wave pattern, shown in Figure 9.20, is calledaMach reﬂection. The calculation of the wave pattern and general properties for a Mach reﬂection requires numerical techniques such as those to be discussed inChapter 13. Another type of shock interaction is shown in Figure 9.21. Here, a shock wave is generated by the concave corner at point Gand propagates upward. De- note this wave as shock A. Shock Ais aleft-running wave, so-called because if you stand on top of the wave and look downstream, you see the shock waverunning in front of you toward the left. Another shock wave is generated bythe concave corner at point H, and propagates downward. Denote this wave as shock B. Shock Bis aright-running wave, so-called because if you stand on top of the wave and look downstream, you see the shock running in front ofyou toward the right. The picture shown in Figure 9.21 is the intersection ofright- and left-running shock waves. The intersection occurs at point E. At the intersection, wave Ais refracted and continues as wave D. Similarly, wave B is refracted and continues as wave C. The ﬂow behind the refracted shock Dis denoted by region 4; the ﬂow behind the refracted shock Cis denoted by region 4 /prime. These two regions are divided by a slip line EF. Across the slip line, the pres- sures are constant (i.e., p4=p4/prime), and the direction (but not necessarily the magnitude) of velocity is the same, namely, parallel to the slip line. All otherproperties in regions 4 and 4 /primeare different, most notably the entropy (s4/negationslash=s4/prime). The conditions which must hold across the slip line, along with the known M1,642 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow H A1 23 4 4/H11032Slip line C GFBD E /H92581/H92582 M1 > 1 Figure 9.21 Intersection of right- and left-running shock waves. 1235 4Streamline Slip lineReflected waveCD E B AF /H92581/H92582 Figure 9.22 Intersection of two left-running shock waves. θ1, andθ2, uniquely determine the shock-wave interaction shown in Figure 9.21. (See Chapter 4 of Reference 21 for details concerning the calculation of this interaction.) Figure 9.22 illustrates the intersection of two left-running shocks generated at corners AandB. The intersection occurs at point C, at which the two shocks merge and propagate as the stronger shock CD, usually along with a weak reﬂected wave CE. This reﬂected wave is necessary to adjust the ﬂow so that the velocities in regions 4 and 5 are in the same direction. Again, a slip line CFtrails downstream of the intersection point.CHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 643 The above cases are by no means all the possible wave interactions in a supersonic ﬂow. However, they represent some of the more common situations encountered frequently in practice. EXAMPLE 9.7 Consider an oblique shock wave generated by a compression corner with a 10◦deﬂec- tion angle. The Mach number of the ﬂow ahead of the corner is 3.6; the ﬂow pressure and temperature are standard sea level conditions. The oblique shock wave subsequentlyimpinges on a straight wall opposite the compression corner. The geometry for this ﬂowis given in Figure 9.19. Calculate the angle of the reﬂected shock wave /Phi1relative to the straight wall. Also, obtain the pressure, temperature, and Mach number behind the reﬂectedwave. ■Solution From the θ-β-Mdiagram, Figure 9.9, for M1=3.6 and θ=10◦,β1=24◦. Hence, Mn,1=M1sinβ1=3.6 sin 24◦=1.464 From Appendix B, Mn,2=0.7157p2 p1=2.32T2 T1=1.294 Also, M2=Mn,2 sin(β−θ)=0.7157 sin(24 −10)=2.96 These are the conditions behind the incident shock wave. They constitute the upstreamﬂow properties for the reﬂected shock wave. We know that the ﬂow must be deﬂectedagain by θ=10 ◦in passing through the reﬂected shock. Thus, from the θ-β-Mdiagram, forM2=2.96 and θ=10◦, we have the wave angle for the reﬂected shock, β2=27.3◦. Note that β2isnotthe angle the reﬂected shock makes with respect to the upper wall; rather, by deﬁnition of the wave angle, β2is the angle between the reﬂected shock and the direction of the ﬂow in region 2. The shock angle relative to the wall is, from the geometryshown in Figure 9.19, /Phi1=β 2−θ=27.3−10=17.3◦ Also, the normal component of the upstream Mach number relative to the reﬂected shockisM 2sinβ2=(2.96) sin 27.3◦=1.358. From Appendix B, p3 p2=1.991T3 T2=1.229 Mn,3=0.7572 Hence, M3=Mn,3 sin(β 2−θ)=0.7572 sin(27.3 −10)=2.55644 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow For standard sea level conditions, p1=2116 lb/ft3andT1=519◦R.

We are now in a position to better understand theproperties of this bow shock, as follows. The ﬂow in Figure 8.1 is sketched in more detail in Figure 9.23. Here, the shock wave stands a distance δin front of the nose of the blunt body; δis deﬁned Figure 9.23 Flow over a supersonic blunt body.CHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 645 Figure 9.24 θ-β-Mdiagram for the sketch shown in Figure 9.23. as the shock detachment distance. At point a, the shock wave is normal to the upstream ﬂow; hence, point acorresponds to a normal shock wave. Away from point a, the shock wave gradually becomes curved and weaker, eventually evolv- ing into a Mach wave at large distances from the body (illustrated by point ein Figure 9.23). A curved bow shock wave is one of the instances in nature when you can observe allpossible oblique shock solutions at once for a given freestream Mach number M1. This takes place between points aande. To see this more clearly, consider the θ-β-Mdiagram sketched in Figure 9.24 in conjunction with Fig- ure 9.23. In Figure 9.24, point acorresponds to the normal shock, and point e corresponds to the Mach wave. Slightly above the centerline, at point bin Fig- ure 9.23, the shock is oblique but pertains to the strong shock-wave solution in Figure 9.24. The ﬂow is deﬂected slightly upward behind the shock at point b. As we move further along the shock, the wave angle becomes more oblique,and the ﬂow deﬂection increases until we encounter point c. Point con the bow shock corresponds to the maximum deﬂection angle shown in Figure 9.24. Abovepoint c, from ctoe, all points on the shock correspond to the weak shock solution. Slightly above point c, at point c /prime, the ﬂow behind the shock becomes sonic. From atoc/prime, the ﬂow is subsonic behind the bow shock; from c/primetoe, it is supersonic. Hence, the ﬂow ﬁeld between the curved bow shock and the blunt body is a mixedregion of both subsonic and supersonic ﬂow. The dividing line between the sub-sonic and supersonic regions is called the sonic line, shown as the dashed line in Figure 9.23. The shape of the detached shock wave, its detachment distance δ, and the complete ﬂow ﬁeld between the shock and the body depend on M 1and the size and shape of the body. The solution of this ﬂow ﬁeld is not trivial. Indeed, the646 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow supersonic blunt-body problem was a major focus for supersonic aerodynamicists during the 1950s and 1960s, spurred by the need to understand the high-speedﬂow over blunt-nosed missiles and reentry bodies. Indeed, it was not until the late1960s that truly sufﬁcient numerical techniques became available for satisfactoryengineering solutions of supersonic blunt-body ﬂows. These modern techniquesare discussed in Chapter 13. EXAMPLE 9.8 Consider the detached curved bow shock wave in front of the two-dimensional parabolic blunt body drawn in Figure 9.25. The freestream is at Mach 8. Consider the two streamlinespassing through the shock at points aandbshown in Figure 9.25. The wave angle at point ais 90 ◦, and that at point bis 60◦. Calculate and compare the value of entropy (relative to the freestream) for streamlines aandbin the ﬂow behind the shock. ■Solution The oblique shock properties studied in this chapter are derived on the basis of a straightoblique shock wave with a uniform ﬂow ﬁeld behind the shock wave, such as sketched inFigure 9.2a. These solutions do not apply to the nonuniform ﬂow ﬁeld behind a curvedshock wave such as shown in Figure 9.25. Such blunt-body solutions are treated in Sec-tion 13.5. The straight oblique shock solutions treated in the present chapter, however,give the shock wave properties at any local point immediately behind the curved shock in Figure 9.25 as long as we know the local wave angle at the point. Therefore, immedi-ately behind the shock at point a, because the shock is a normal shock at that point, we have M n,1=8 From Appendix B, for Mn,1=8,p2/p1=74.5 and T2/T1=13.39. From Equation (7.25), the entropy increase across the shock is s2−s1=cplnT2 T1−Rlnp2 p1 Since cp=γR γ−1=(1.4)(287) 0.4=1004.5J Kg·K Then s2−s1=(1004.5) ln 13.39 −(287) ln 74.5 s2−s1=1370J Kg·K Downstream of the shock wave, the ﬂow along any given streamline is both adiabatic (noheat transfer) and reversible (no friction, etc.), hence the ﬂow along a given streamlinebehind the shock wave is isentropic. Therefore, along streamline a, the entropy is constantCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 647 Streamline aStreamline b b2 1 a Figure 9.25 Two streamlines crossing a detached bow shockwave in front of a blunt body at Mach 8. and equal to its value at point ajust behind the shock wave. Thus, s2−s1=1370J Kg·Kalong streamline a Immediately behind the curved bow shock at point b, where β=60◦, we have Mn,1=M1sinβ=8 sin 60◦ =8(0.866) =6.928 From Appendix B, using the nearest entry of Mn,1=6.9, we have p2/p1=55.38 and T2/T1=10.2. Thus, at point b, s2−s1=cplnT2 T1−Rlnp2 p1 =(1004.5) ln 10.2 −(287) ln 55.38 =1180J Kg·Kalong streamline b The entropy along streamline bis smaller than that along streamline abecause streamline bpasses through a weaker part of the bow shock wave.648 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 9.5.1 Comment on the Flow Field Behind a Curved Shock Wave: Entropy Gradients and Vorticity As illustrated by Example 9.8, the entropy is different along different streamlines behind a curved shock wave. For the case treated in Example 9.8, streamline a passes through the normal shock at point aand then ﬂows downstream, wetting the surface of the body, as shown in Figure 9.25. This is the maximum entropystreamline. All other streamlines have smaller values of entropy; streamline bhas a smaller entropy than streamline abecause it passes through a weaker part of the curved shock wave at point b. Therefore, if you visualize a line that cuts through the ﬂow ﬁeld from point 1 to point 2 in Figure 9.25, the entropy decreases alongthis line from the body to the shock. That is, there exists an entropy gradient, ∇s, in the ﬂow. For blunt-nosed hypersonic bodies the entropy gradient can be quitelarge, and is the source of the “entropy layer” that interacts with the boundarylayer on hypersonic bodies (see, for example, Reference 52). The presence of entropy gradients in the ﬂow behind a curved shock wave has another consequence—the production of vorticity in the ﬂow. The physicalconnection between entropy gradients and vorticity is quantiﬁed by Crocco’s theorem, a combination of the momentum equation and the combined ﬁrst andsecond laws of thermodynamics: T∇s=∇h o−V×(∇× V) Crocco’s theorem In this equation, ∇sis the entropy gradient, ∇hois the gradient in the total enthalpy, and ∇×Vis the vorticity. For a derivation of Crocco’s theorem, see, for example, Section 6.6 of Reference 21. For our discussion, we present Crocco’stheorem simply to emphasize an important feature of the ﬂow behind the curvedshock shown in Figure 9.25. The ﬂow is adiabatic, hence ∇h ois zero everywhere in the ﬂow. However, ∇sis ﬁnite, and therefore from Crocco’s theorem ∇× V must be ﬁnite. Conclusion: The ﬂow ﬁeld behind a curved shock wave is rotational .A sa result, a velocity potential with all its analytical advantages discussed earlier inthis book cannot be deﬁned for the blunt-body ﬂow ﬁeld. Consequently, the ﬂowﬁeld behind a curved shock is computed by means of numerical solutions of thecontinuity, momentum, and energy equations. Such computational ﬂuid dynamicsolutions are discussed in Section 13.5. 9.6 PRANDTL-MEYER EXPANSION WAVES Oblique shock waves, as discussed in Sections 9.2 to 9.5, occur when a supersonicﬂow is turned into itself (see again Figure 9.2 a). In contrast, when a supersonic ﬂow is turned away from itself, an expansion wave is formed, as sketched inFigure 9.2b. Examine this ﬁgure carefully, and review the surrounding discussionin Section 9.1 before progressing further. The purpose of the present section isto develop a theory which allows us to calculate the changes in ﬂow propertiesCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 649 Forward Mach lineRearward Mach line1 2T1 T2p2M2p1M1 >1 /H92621/H92622 /H9258 Figure 9.26 Prandtl-Meyer expansion. across such expansion waves. To this stage in our discussion of oblique waves, we have completed the left-hand branch of the road map in Figure 9.6. In thissection, we cover the right-hand branch. The expansion fan in Figure 9.2b is acontinuous expansion region that can be visualized as an inﬁnite number of Mach waves, each making the Mach angle μ [see Equation (9.1)] with the local ﬂow direction. As sketched in Figure 9.26, theexpansion fan is bounded upstream by a Mach wave which makes the angle μ 1 with respect to the upstream ﬂow, where μ1=arcsin(1/ M1). The expansion fan is bounded downstream by another Mach wave which makes the angle μ2with respect to the downstream ﬂow, where μ2=arcsin(1/ M2). Since the expansion through the wave takes place across a continuous succession of Mach waves, andsince ds=0 for each Mach wave, the expansion is isentropic. This is in direct contrast to ﬂow across an oblique shock, which always experiences an entropyincrease. The fact that the ﬂow through an expansion wave is isentropic is a greatlysimplifying aspect, as we will soon appreciate. An expansion wave emanating from a sharp convex corner as sketched in Figures 9.2b and 9.26 is called a centered expansion wave. Ludwig Prandtl and his student Theodor Meyer ﬁrst worked out a theory for centered expansion wavesin 1907–1908, and hence such waves are commonly denoted as Prandtl-Meyer expansion waves. The problem of an expansion wave is as follows: Referring to Figure 9.26, given the upstream ﬂow (region 1) and the deﬂection angle θ, calculate the down- stream ﬂow (region 2). Let us proceed. Consider a very weak wave produced by an inﬁnitesimally small ﬂow deﬂec- tiondθas sketched in Figure 9.27. We consider the limit of this picture as dθ→0; hence, the wave is essentially a Mach wave at the angle μto the upstream ﬂow. The velocity ahead of the wave is V. As the ﬂow is deﬂected downward through the angle dθ, the velocity is increased by the inﬁnitesimal amount dV, and hence the ﬂow velocity behind the wave is V+dVinclined at the angle dθ. Recall from the treatment of the momentum equation in Section 9.2 that any change in650 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 9.27 Geometrical construction for the inﬁnitesimal changes across an inﬁnitesimally weak wave (in the limit, a Mach wave). velocity across a wave takes place normal to the wave; the tangential component is unchanged across the wave. In Figure 9.27, the horizontal line segment AB with length Vis drawn behind the wave. Also, the line segment ACis drawn to represent the new velocity V+dVbehind the wave. Then line BCis normal to the wave because it represents the line along which the change in velocity occurs. Examining the geometry in Figure 9.27, from the law of sines applied to triangleABC , we see that V+dV V=sin(π/2 +μ) sin(π/2 −μ−dθ)(9.24) However, from trigonometric identities, sin/parenleftbiggπ 2+μ/parenrightbigg =sin/parenleftbiggπ 2−μ/parenrightbigg =cosμ (9.25) sin/parenleftbiggπ 2−μ−dθ/parenrightbigg =cos(μ +dθ)=cosμcosdθ−sinμsindθ(9.26) Substituting Equations (9.25) and (9.26) into (9.24), we have 1+dV V=cosμ cosμcosdθ−sinμsindθ(9.27) For small dθ, we can make the small-angle assumptions sin dθ≈dθand cosdθ≈1. Then, Equation (9.27) becomes 1+dV V=cosμ cosμ−dθsinμ=1 1−dθtanμ(9.28)CHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 651 Figure 9.28 Right triangle associated with the Mach angle. Note that the function 1/(1 −x)can be expanded in a power series (for x<1) as 1 1−x=1+x+x2+x3+··· Hence, Equation (9.28) can be expanded as (ignoring terms of second order and higher) 1+dV V=1+dθtanμ+··· (9.29) Thus, from Equation (9.29), dθ=dV/V tanμ(9.30) From Equation (9.1), we know that μ=arcsin(1/ M). Hence, the right triangle in Figure 9.28 demonstrates that tanμ=1√ M2−1(9.31) Substituting Equation (9.31) into (9.30), we obtain dθ=√ M2−1dV V(9.32) Equation (9.32) relates the inﬁnitesimal change in velocity dVto the inﬁnites- imal deﬂection dθacross a wave of vanishing strength. In the precise limit of a Mach wave, of course dVand hence dθare zero. In this sense, Equa- tion (9.32) is an approximate equation for a ﬁnite dθ, but it becomes a true equality as dθ→0. Since the expansion fan illustrated in Figures 9.2b and 9.26 is a region of an inﬁnite number of Mach waves, Equation (9.32) is adifferential equation which precisely describes the ﬂow inside the expansionwave.652 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Return to Figure 9.26. Let us integrate Equation (9.32) from region 1, where the deﬂection angle is zero and the Mach number is M1, to region 2, where the deﬂection angle is θand the Mach number is M2: /integraldisplayθ 0dθ=θ=/integraldisplayM2 M1/radicalbig M2−1dV V(9.33) To carry out the integral on the right-hand side of Equation (9.33), dV/Vmust be obtained in terms of M, as follows. From the deﬁnition of Mach number, M=V/a, we have V=Ma, or lnV=lnM+lna (9.34) Differentiating Equation (9.34), we obtain dV V=dM M+da a(9.35) From Equations (8.25) and (8.40), we have /parenleftbigga0 a/parenrightbigg2 =T0 T=1+γ−1 2M2(9.36) Solving Equation (9.36) for a, we obtain a=a0/parenleftbigg 1+γ−1 2M2/parenrightbigg−1/2 (9.37) Differentiating Equation (9.37), we obtain da a=−/parenleftbiggγ−1 2/parenrightbigg M/parenleftbigg 1+γ−1 2M2/parenrightbigg−1 dM (9.38) Substituting Equation (9.38) into (9.35), we have dV V=1 1+[(γ−1)/2] M2dM M(9.39) Equation (9.39) is a relation for dV/Vstrictly in terms of M—this is precisely what is desired for the integral in Equation (9.33). Hence, substituting Equa- tion (9.39) into (9.33), we have θ=/integraldisplayM2 M1√ M2−1 1+[(γ−1)/2] M2dM M(9.40) In Equation (9.40), the integral ν(M)≡/integraldisplay √ M2−1 1+[(γ−1)/2] M2dM M(9.41)CHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 653 is called the Prandtl-Meyer function, denoted by ν. Carrying out the integration, Equation (9.41) becomes ν(M)=/radicalBigg γ+1 γ−1tan−1/radicalBigg γ−1 γ+1(M2−1)−tan−1/radicalbig M2−1 (9.42) The constant of integration that would ordinarily appear in Equation (9.42) is not important, because it drops out when Equation (9.42) is used for the deﬁ-nite integral in Equation (9.40). For convenience, it is chosen as zero, such thatν(M)=0 when M=1. Finally, we can now write Equation (9.40), combined with (9.41), as θ=ν(M2)−ν(M1) (9.43) where ν(M)is given by Equation (9.42) for a calorically perfect gas. The Prandtl- Meyer function νis very important; it is the key to the calculation of changes across an expansion wave. Because of its importance, νis tabulated as a function of Min Appendix C. For convenience, values of μare also tabulated in Appendix C. How do the above results solve the problem stated in Figure 9.26; that is how can we obtain the properties in region 2 from the known properties in region 1and the known deﬂection angle θ? The answer is straightforward: 1.For the given M 1, obtain ν(M1)from Appendix C. 2.Calculate ν(M2)from Equation (9.43), using the known θand the value of ν(M1)obtained in step 1. 3.Obtain M2from Appendix C corresponding to the value of ν(M2)from step 2. 4.The expansion wave is isentropic; hence, p0andT0are constant through the wave. That is, T0,2=T0,1andp0,2=p0,1. From Equation (8.40), we have T2 T1=T2/T0,2 T1/T0,1=1+[(γ−1)/2] M2 1 1+[(γ−1)/2] M2 2(9.44) From Equation (8.42), we have p2 p1=p2/p0 p1/p0=/parenleftbigg1+[(γ−1)/2] M2 1 1+[(γ−1)/2] M2 2/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) (9.45) Since we know both M1andM2, as well as T1andp1, Equations (9.44) and (9.45) allow the calculation of T2andp2downstream of the expansion wave. EXAMPLE 9.9 A supersonic ﬂow with M1=1.5, p1=1 atm, and T1=288 K is expanded around a sharp corner (see Figure 9.26) through a deﬂection angle of 15◦. Calculate M2,p2,T2, p0,2,T0,2, and the angles that the forward and rearward Mach lines make with respect to the upstream ﬂow direction.654 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow ■Solution From Appendix C, for M1=1.5,ν1=11.91◦. From Equation (9.43), ν2=ν1+θ= 11.91+15=26.91◦. Thus, M2=2.0 (rounding to the nearest entry in the table). From Appendix A, for M1=1.5, p0,1/p1=3.671 and T0,1/T1=1.45, and for M2=2.0, p0,2/p2=7.824 and T0,2/T2=1.8. Since the ﬂow is isentropic, T0,2=T0,1andp0,2=p0,1. Thus, p2=p2 p0,2p0,2 p0,1p0,1 p1p1=1 7.824(1)(3.671)(1 atm) =0.469 atm T2=T2 T0,2T0,2 T0,1T0,1 T1T1=1 1.8(1)(1.45)(288) =232 K p0,2=p0,1=p0,1 p1p1=3.671(1 atm) =3.671 atm T0,2=T0,1=T0,1 T1T1=1.45(288) =417.6 K Returning to Figure 9.26, we have Angle of forward Mach line =μ1=41.81◦ Angle of rearward Mach line =μ2−θ=30−15=15◦ DESIGN BOX In Example 8.14 we indicated the reasons why an air-breathing power plant for high Mach number, hy-personic vehicles would have to be a supersonic com-bustion ramjet engine—a SCRAMjet. The design ofsuch an engine depends heavily on the properties ofoblique shock waves and expansion waves—the sub-jects of this chapter. In this design box, we examinesome of the basic design features of SCRAMjet en-gines. Looking ahead to the future of aerodynamicsin the twenty-ﬁrst century, hypersonic ﬂight is essen-tially the last frontier of our quest to ﬂy faster andhigher. Many of the hypersonic vehicles of the futurewill be powered by SCRAMjet engines. So the mate-rial in this design box is much like peering through awindow into the future. Two experimental SCRAMjet powered vehicles have successfully ﬂown, the X-51 shown in Figure9.29aand the X-43 shown in Figure 9.29b (Reference 67). These experimental airplanes are paving the wayto the future of hypersonic air-breathing airplanes. The side view of a generic hypersonic vehicle powered by a SCRAMjet is shown in Figure 9.30. Es-sentially, the entire bottom surface of the vehicle isan integrated portion of the air-breathing SCRAMjetCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 655 (a) SCRAMjet-powered X-51 experimental vehicle.

[(a)U.S. Air Force Photo; (b)NASA]. engine. The forebody shock wave (1) from the nose of the vehicle is the initial part of the compressionprocess for the engine. Air ﬂowing through this shockwave is compressed, and then enters the SCRAMjetengine module (2) where it is further compressed byreﬂected shock waves inside the engine duct, mixedwith fuel, and then expanded out the back end of themodule. The back end of the vehicle is scooped out(3) in order to further enhance the expansion of theexhaust gas. At the design ﬂight condition, the fore-body shock wave impinges right at the leading edgeof the cowl (4), so that all the ﬂow passing throughthe shock will enter the engine, rather than some ofthe air spilling around the external surface. It is also possible to further compress the air be- fore it enters the engine module by creating an isen-tropic compression wave downstream of the shock.This is shown in Figure 9.31, patterned after Refer-ence 68. Here, the bottom surface of the vehicle iscontoured just right to form an isentropic compres-sion wave that will focus at the leading edge of thecowl, right where the forebody shock wave is imping-ing as well. An isentropic compression wave is theopposite of the isentropic expansion wave discussedin Section 9.6, but the calculation of its properties isgoverned by the same Prandtl-Meyer function givenin Equation (9.42), except in this case the local Machnumber decreases through the wave, and the pressureincreases. To create such an isentropic compressionwave in reality is quite difﬁcult; the contour of thebody surface must be a speciﬁc shape for a speciﬁc up-stream Mach number, and most efforts over the yearsto produce isentropic compression waves in varioussupersonic and hypersonic ﬂow devices have usuallyresulted in the wave prematurely coalescing into sev-eral weak shock waves with associated entropy in-creases and total pressure loss. SCRAMjet-poweredvehicles might incorporate such an isentropic com-pression surface. Other physical phenomena that in-ﬂuence SCRAMjet engine performance and vehicleaerodynamics are also noted in Figure 9.31. The lead-ing edge must be blunted in order to reduce the aero-dynamic heating at the nose (to be discussed in Chap-ter 14). The viscous boundary layer over the surface ofthe body creates drag and aerodynamic heating, andwhen a shock wave impinges on the boundary layer,ﬂow separation and local reattachment may occur, cre-ating local regions of high heat transfer (the shockwave/boundary layer interaction problem). There isalways the important question as to where transitionfrom laminar to turbulent boundary layer ﬂow occursalong the body, because turbulent boundary layers re-sult in increased aerodynamic heating and skin fric-tion. Finally, when the forebody shock impinges onthe leading edge of the cowl, it will interact with thelocal shock wave created at the blunt leading edgeof the cowl, resulting in a shock–shock interaction656 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 1M/H11009 >> 1 Shock wave from forebody 42 Scramjet engine module Cowl3 Expansion surface Figure 9.30 Sketch of a generic hypersonic vehicle powered by a SCRAMjet engine.

All of these phenomenainﬂuence the quality of the ﬂow entering the SCRAM-jet module, and they pose challenging problems for thedesigners of future SCRAMjet engines. A generic sketch indicating the ﬂow path through the SCRAMjet is shown in Figure 9.32. Here againwe see the forebody shock impinging at the lead-ing edge of the cowl, and a contoured compressionsurface to encourage an isentropic compression be-hind the shock. The cross-sectional area of the stream-tube ﬂowing through the shock wave, as noted inFigure 9.32, is greatly reduced behind the shock andthrough the compression wave owing to the large in-crease of air density through these compression pro-cesses. Because of this, the ﬂow path through thecombustor has a much smaller cross-sectional area.In Figure 9.32, points 4 and 5 denote the entranceCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 657 WingFin57.2 ft 110 ft 4.27/H11034A Engine modulesIsentropic rampWedge 54 ft 37 ft 15.4 ft10/H11034 A = 100 ft2A = 175 ft2Translating cowl Figure 9.33 Two-sided view of a conceptual vehicle design.

Billig (Refer- ence 69) has calculated typical ﬂow conditions en-tering the combustor (at point 4) as a function offreestream Mach number M ∞and ﬂight altitude. Some of his results are tabulated above, where A0 is the cross-sectional area of the streamtube in thefreestream (see Figure 9.32), A 4is its cross-sectional area at location 4, and M4,p4,T4, and V4are the local Mach number, pressure, temperature, and ﬂowvelocity, respectively, at location 4. Note from the tabulation that the local Mach number entering the combustor for the given condi-tions ranges from about 3 to above 6. The combus-tion takes place in this high Mach number stream—the very essence of a SCRAMjet engine. Also notefrom Figure 9.32 that the cross-sectional area of thecombustor increases from point 4 to point 5 along itslength; this is to accommodate the local heat addi-tion to the ﬂow due to burning with the fuel, and stillkeep the ﬂow moving at supersonic speed. (In Refer-ence 21, among others, it is shown that heat additionto a supersonic ﬂow slows the ﬂow, whereas we willprove in Chapter 10 that increasing the cross-sectionalarea of a supersonic ﬂow increases its speed. Hence,the combustor area in a SCRAMjet must be increasedin the ﬂow direction in order to keep the heat additionprocess from slowing the ﬂow too much.) A two-sided (bottom and side) view of a con- ceptual design for a SCRAMjet powered hypersonicvehicle is given in Figure 9.33, patterned after thedesign discussed by Billig (Reference 69). Note theslender shape for aerodynamic efﬁciency (high lift-to-drag ratio), the wedge and isentropic ramp to com-press the ﬂow before entering the engine modules,and the translating cowl in order to properly positionthe impinging shock wave on the cowl leading edgeas the freestream Mach number changes.

America ﬂew its ﬁrst SCRAMjet-powered ﬂight vehicle, the X-43, also labeled the Hyper-X, in 2004.A three-view of the X-43 is given in Figure 9.34.This small unpiloted test vehicle was launched froma modiﬁed Orbital Sciences Pegasus ﬁrst stage rocketbooster, which in turn was launched from a B-52bomber in ﬂight. The primary purpose of the X-43is to demonstrate the viability of a SCRAMjet en-gine under actual ﬂight conditions, as opposed toresearch results in ground test facilities. In particular,in two successful test ﬂights it successively demon-strated performance at M ∞=7 and 10. The X-43 is a NASA project; it was the ﬁrst free-ﬂight ofan airframe integrated supersonic combustion ramjetengine. EXAMPLE 9.10 In the preceding discussion on SCRAMjet engines, an isentropic compression wave was mentioned as one of the possible compression mechanisms. Consider the isentropic com-pression surface sketched in Figure 9.35a. The Mach number and pressure upstream of thewave are M 1=10 and p1=1 atm, respectively. The ﬂow is turned through a total angle of 15◦. Calculate the Mach number and pressure in region 2 behind the compression wave. ■Solution From Appendix C, for M1=10,ν1=102.3◦. In region 2, ν2=ν1−θ=102.3−15=87.3◦ From Appendix C for ν2=87.3◦, we have (closest entry) M2=6.4CHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 659 Compression wave M1 = 10 p1 = 1 atm (a) Isentropic compression corner1 2 M1 = 10 p1 = 1 atm (b) Shock compression corner1 2 Shock wave /H9258 = 15/H11034/H9258 = 15/H11034 Figure 9.35 Figures for (a) Example 9.9 and (b) Example 9.10. From Appendix A, for M1=10,p0,1/p1=0.4244 ×105and for M2=6.4, p0,2/p2= 0.2355 ×104.

Calculate the downstream Mach number, static pressure,and total pressure in region 2. Compare the results with those obtained in Example 9.10,and comment on the signiﬁcance of the comparison. ■Solution From Figure 9.9 for M1=10 and θ=15◦, the wave angle is β=20◦. The component of the upstream Mach number perpendicular to the wave is Mn,1=M1sinβ=(10) sin 20◦=34.2 From Appendix B for Mn,1=3.42, we have (nearest entry), p2/p1=13.32, p0,2/p0,1= 0.2322, and Mn,2=0.4552. Hence M2=Mn,2 sin(β−θ)=0.4552 sin(20 −15)=5.22 p2=(p2/p1)p1=13.32(1) =13.32 atm660 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow The total pressure in region 1 can be obtained from Appendix A as follows. For M1=10, p0,1/p1=0.4244 ×105. Hence, the total pressure in region 2 is p0,2=/parenleftbiggp0,2 p0,1/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggp0,1 p1/parenrightbigg (p1)=(0.2322)(0.4244 ×105)(1)=9.85×103atm As a check, we can calculate p0,2as follows. (This check also alerts us to the error incurred when we round to the nearest entry in the tables.) From Appendix A for M2=5.22, p0,2/p2=0.6661 ×103(nearest entry). Hence, p0,2=/parenleftbiggp0.2 p2/parenrightbigg (p2)=(0.6661 ×103)(13.32) =8.87×103atm Note this answer is 10 percent lower than that obtained above, which is simply due to our rounding to the nearest entry in the tables. The error incurred by taking the nearest entryis exacerbated by the very high Mach numbers in this example. Much better accuracy canbe obtained by properly interpolating between table entries. Comparing the results from this example and Example 9.10, we clearly see that the isentropic compression is a more efﬁcient compression process, yielding a downstream Mach number and pressure that are both considerably higher thanin the case of the shock wave. The inefﬁciency of the shock wave is measured bythe loss of total pressure across the shock; total pressure drops by about 77 percentacross the shock. This emphasizes why designers of supersonic and hypersonicinlets would love to have the compression process carried out via isentropiccompression waves. However, as noted in our discussion on SCRAMjets, it is verydifﬁcult to achieve such a compression in real life; the contour of the compressionsurface must be quite precise, and it is a point design for the given upstreamMach number. At off-design Mach numbers, even the best-designed compressioncontour will result in shocks. 9.7 SHOCK-EXPANSION THEORY: APPLICATIONS TO SUPERSONIC AIRFOILS Consider a ﬂat plate of length cat an angle of attack αin a supersonic ﬂow, as sketched in Figure 9.36. On the top surface, the ﬂow is turned away from itself;hence, an expansion wave occurs at the leading edge, and the pressure on the topsurface p 2is less than the freestream pressure p2<p1. At the trailing edge, the ﬂow must return to approximately (but not precisely) the freestream direction.Here, the ﬂow is turned back into itself, and consequently a shock wave occurs atthe trailing edge. On the bottom surface, the ﬂow is turned into itself; an obliqueshock wave occurs at the leading edge, and the pressure on the bottom surface p 3 is greater than the freestream pressure p3>p1. At the trailing edge, the ﬂow is turned into approximately (but not precisely) the freestream direction by means ofan expansion wave. Examining Figure 9.36, note that the top and bottom surfacesof the ﬂat plate experience uniform pressure distribution of p 2andp3, respectively,CHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 661 /H9251 /H9251 321L RD M1 > 1 p3 > p 1cp2 < p 1p1 Figure 9.36 Flat plate at an angle of attack in a supersonic ﬂow. and that p3>p2. This creates a net pressure imbalance that generates the resultant aerodynamic force R, shown in Figure 9.36. Indeed, for a unit span, the resultant force and its components, lift and drag, per unit span are R/prime=(p3−p2)c (9.46) L/prime=(p3−p2)ccosα (9.47) D/prime=(p3−p2)csinα (9.48) In Equations (9.47) and (9.48), p3is calculated from oblique shock properties (Section 9.2), and p2is calculated from expansion-wave properties (Section 9.6). Moreover, these are exact calculations; no approximations have been made. The inviscid, supersonic ﬂow over a ﬂat plate at angle of attack is exactly given by the combination of shock and expansion waves sketched in Figure 9.36. The ﬂat-plate case given above is the simplest example of a general technique called shock-expansion theory. Whenever we have a body made up of straight-line segments and the deﬂection angles are small enough so that no detached shockwaves occur, the ﬂow over the body goes through a series of distinct obliqueshock and expansion waves, and the pressure distribution on the surface (hencethe lift and drag) can be obtained exactly from both the shock- and expansion-wave theories discussed in this chapter. As another example of the application of shock-expansion theory, consider the diamond-shape airfoil in Figure 9.37. Assume the airfoil is at 0 ◦angle of attack. The supersonic ﬂow over the airfoil is ﬁrst compressed and deﬂectedthrough the angle εby the oblique shock wave at the leading edge. At midchord, the ﬂow is expanded through an angle 2ε , creating an expansion wave. At the trailing edge, the ﬂow is turned back to the freestream direction through anotheroblique shock. The pressure distributions on the front and back faces of the airfoilare sketched in Figure 9.37; note that the pressures on faces aandcare uniform662 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 9.37 Diamond-wedge airfoil at zero angle of attack in a supersonic ﬂow. and equal to p2and that the pressures on faces banddare also uniform but equal top3, where p3<p2. In the lift direction, perpendicular to the freestream, the pressure distributions on the top and bottom faces exactly cancel (i.e., L/prime=0). In contrast, in the drag direction, parallel to the freestream, the pressure on the front faces aandcis larger than on the back faces bandd, and this results in a ﬁnite drag. To calculate this drag (per unit span), consider the geometry of thediamond airfoil in Figure 9.37, where lis the length of each face and tis the airfoil thickness. Then, D /prime=2(p2lsinε−p3lsinε)=2(p2−p3)t 2 Hence, D/prime=(p2−p3)t (9.49) In Equation (9.49), p2is calculated from oblique shock theory, and p3is obtained from expansion-wave theory. Moreover, these pressures are the exact values for supersonic, inviscid ﬂow over the diamond airfoil. At this stage, it is worthwhile to recall our discussion in Section 1.5 con- cerning the source of aerodynamic force on a body. In particular, examine Equa-tions (1.1), (1.2), (1.7), and (1.8). These equations give the means to calculate L /prime andD/primefrom the pressure and shear stress distributions over the surface of a body of general shape. The results of the present section, namely, Equations (9.47)and (9.48) for a ﬂat plate and Equation (9.49) for the diamond airfoil, are simplyspecialized results from the more general formulas given in Section 1.5. However,rather than formally going through the integration indicated in Equations (1.7)and (1.8), we obtained our results for the simple bodies in Figures 9.36 and 9.37in a more direct fashion. The results of this section illustrate a very important aspect of inviscid, su- personic ﬂow. Note that Equation (9.48) for the ﬂat plate and Equation (9.49)for the diamond airfoil predict a ﬁnite drag for these two-dimensional proﬁles.CHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 663 This is in direct contrast to our results for two-dimensional bodies in a low-speed, incompressible ﬂow, as discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, where the drag was theo-retically zero. That is, in supersonic ﬂow, d’Alembert’s paradox does not occur.In a supersonic, inviscid ﬂow, the drag per unit span on a two-dimensional bodyis ﬁnite. This new source of drag is called wave drag, and it represents a serious consideration in the design of all supersonic airfoils. The existence of wave dragis inherently related to the increase in entropy and consequently to the loss oftotal pressure across the oblique shock waves created by the airfoil. Finally, the results of this section represent a merger of both the left- and right-hand branches of our road map shown in Figure 9.6. As such, it brings usto a logical conclusion of our discussion of oblique waves in supersonic ﬂows. EXAMPLE 9.12 Calculate the lift and drag coefﬁciens for a ﬂat plate at a 5◦angle of attack in a Mach 3 ﬂow. ■Solution Refer to Figure 9.36. First, calculate p2/p1on the upper surface. From Equation (9.43), ν2=ν1+θ where θ=α. From Appendix C, for M1=3,ν1=49.76◦. Thus, ν2=49.76◦+5◦=54.76◦ From Appendix C, M2=3.27 From Appendix A, for M1=3,p01/p1=36.73; for M2=3.27, p02/p2=55.

Hence, Mn,1=M1sinβ=3 sin 23.1◦=1.177 From Appendix B, for Mn,1=1.177, p3/p1=1.458 (nearest entry).

Reﬂect also on the result obtained in Example 9.12,where the lift and drag coefﬁcients were calculated for a ﬂat plate at a 5 ◦angle of attack in a Mach 3 ﬂow. Note that to calculate these coefﬁcients we did not needto know the freestream pressure, density, or velocity. All we needed to know was: 1.The shape of the body 2.The angle of attack 3.The freestream Mach number These examples are clear-cut illustrations of the results of dimensional analysis discussed in Section 1.7, and are totally consistent with Equations (1.42) and(1.43), which emphasize that lift and drag coefﬁcients for a body of given shapeare functions of only Reynolds number, Mach number, and angle of attack. For the examples in this chapter, we are dealing with an inviscid ﬂow, so Re is notrelevant—only M ∞andα. 9.9 THE X-15 AND ITS WEDGE TAIL Examine the photograph of the X-15 hypersonic research vehicle shown in Fig-ure 9.18. The viewpoint in this photograph is looking down at the top of thevehicle. Concentrate on the vertical tail at the rear of the airplane. The crosssection of the vertical tail is clearly seen—it is a wedge cross section in contrast to the type of thin symmetric airfoil sections usually employed for vertical tailson airplanes. The wedge shape is further emphasized by examining Figure 9.38,CHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 665 10/H11034 Figure 9.38 Illustration of the wedge-shaped tail on the X-15. which shows a drawing of the rear top portion of the X-15. The included angle of the wedge cross section is 10◦. The wedge tail is one of the unique design aspects of the X-15. It came out of concern for stability problems at hypersonic speeds. The earlier X-1 andX-2 supersonic research vehicles had encountered such problems at much lowerMach numbers, and one of the major early concerns in the design of the X-15was to ﬁnd a solution that would provide stability up to Mach 7. The answer wasprovided by C. H. McLellan, an NACA engineer at the NACA Langley MemorialLaboratory. McLellan had carried out theoretical calculations of the inﬂuence ofairfoil shape on normal force at hypersonic speeds. He found that a 10 ◦wedge was more effective than a thin supersonic section. The X-15 designers were awareof McLellan’s work, and designed the aircraft with a 10 ◦wedge tail that provided adequate directional stability for the hypersonic vehicle. Why is a wedge tail more effective than one with a thin section? To help answer this question, consider the following example. EXAMPLE 9.13 Consider the ﬂat plate shown in Figure 9.39 aand the 10◦included angle wedge shown in Figure 9.39b , both at an angle of attack of 10◦in a Mach 7 airstream. ( a) Calculate the lift coefﬁcient of the ﬂat plate. (b ) Calculate the lift coefﬁcient of the wedge. ■Solution (a) First, consider the expansion wave over the top of the plate.

For a vertical tail surface, the “lift is the side force that creates the restoring yaw moment provided by the vertical tail when the airplane experiences a disturbance or displacement in yaw.” Clearly, the wedge providesa much stronger restoring moment than a very thin airfoil shape represented bythe ﬂat plate in Figure 9.39 a. Physically, the wedge at angle of attack, when compared to a ﬂat plate at the same angle of attack, is taking advantage of the nonlinear nature of supersonicshock waves. When the ﬂat plate in Example 9.13 ais pitched to a 10 ◦angle of attack, the deﬂection angle of the ﬂow over the bottom surface is also 10◦. In contrast, with the wedge in Example 9.13b , the deﬂection angle of the ﬂow over the bottom surface is already at 5◦when the wedge is at zero angle of attack, and then is increased to 15◦when the wedge is pitched to an angle of attack of 10◦. This gives a shock wave angle for the wedge of 23.5◦, larger than the 16.5◦ wave angle for the ﬂat plate. Examining Equations (9.13) and (9.16), we note thatthe pressure ratio across an oblique shock varies essentially as the square of the wave angle. This is why the pressure ratio on the bottom surface of the wedgefrom Examples 9.13b istwice as large as that for the ﬂat plate in Example 9.13 a, p 3/p1=8.915 for the wedge as compared to p3/p1=4.45 for the ﬂat plate. The wedge, by already starting with a ﬂow deﬂection angle at zero angle of attack,gets “more bang for the buck” at angle of attack. Finally, we note that the wedge tail on the X-15 is a beautiful example of how theoretical aerodynamic research, done to extend the aerodynamic state ofthe art, was taken off the library shelves later on to solve a show-stopping prob-lem of major importance to the practical design of a pioneering airplane, theX-15. McLellan’s research at the NACA helped to make the X-15 possible. (SeeReference 116.)CHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 669 9.10 VISCOUS FLOW: SHOCK-WAVE/ BOUNDARY-LAYER INTERACTION Shock waves and boundary layers do not mix; bad things can happen when a shock wave impinges on a boundary layer. Unfortunately, shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions frequently occur in practical supersonic ﬂows, and thereforewe pay attention to this interaction in the present section. The ﬂuid dynamics ofa shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction is complex (and extremely interesting),and a detailed presentation is beyond the scope of this book. Here we give a briefqualitative discussion—just enough to acquaint you with the basic picture. Consider a supersonic ﬂow over a surface wherein an oblique shock wave impinges on the surface, such as sketched in Figure 9.19. In this ﬁgure theﬂow is assumed to be inviscid, and the incident shock impinges at point Bon the upper wall, giving rise to a reﬂected shock emanating from the same point.There is a discontinuous pressure increase at point B, a combination of the pres- sure increases across the incident and reﬂected shocks. Indeed, point Bis a singular point where there is an inﬁnitely large adverse pressure gradient. Imagine that suddenly we have a boundary layer along the wall in Figure 9.19. At point B, the boundary layer would experience an inﬁnitely large adverse pres- sure gradient. In Section 4.12, we discussed what happens to a boundary layerwhen it experiences a large adverse pressure gradient—it separates from the sur-face. These are the basic elements of the shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction.The incident shock wave imposes a strong adverse pressure gradient on the bound-ary layer, which in turn separates from the surface, and the resulting ﬂow ﬁeld inthe vicinity of the shock wave impingement becomes one of a mutual interactionbetween the boundary layer and the shock wave. This mutual interaction is sketched qualitatively in Figure 9.40. Here, for ease of presentation, we show a shock wave impinging on a lower wall ratherthan on the upper wall as in Figure 9.19. In Figure 9.40, we see a boundary layergrowing along a ﬂat plate. Because the external ﬂow is supersonic, the boundary-layer velocity proﬁle is subsonic near the wall and supersonic near the outeredge. At some downstream location an incident shock impinges on the boundarylayer. The large pressure rise across the shock wave acts as a severe adverse pres-sure gradient imposed on the boundary layer, thus causing the boundary layer tolocally separate from the surface. Because the high pressure behind the shockfeeds upstream through the subsonic portion of the boundary layer, the separa-tion takes place ahead of the theoretical inviscid ﬂow impingement point of theincident shock wave. In turn, the separated boundary layer deﬂects the external su-personic ﬂow into itself, thus inducing a second shock wave, identiﬁed here as theinduced separation shock wave. The separated boundary layer subsequently turnsback toward the plate, reattaching to the surface at some downstream location.Here again the supersonic ﬂow is deﬂected into itself, causing a third shock wavecalled the reattachment shock. Between the separation and reattachment shocks, where the boundary layer is turning back toward the surface, the supersonic ﬂow isturned away from itself, generating expansion waves shown in Figure 9.40.

Further away from the plate, the separation and reattachment shocks mergeto form the conventional reﬂected shock wave that is expected from the inviscidpicture, as shown in Figure 9.19. The scale and severity of the interaction shown inFigure 9.40 depends on whether the boundary layer is laminar or turbulent. Sincelaminar boundary layers separate more readily than turbulent boundary layers(see Section 4.12), the laminar interaction usually takes place more readily withmore severe attendant consequences than the turbulent interaction. However, thegeneral qualitative aspects of the interaction shown in Figure 9.40 are the same forboth cases. The shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction has a major effect on the pres- sure, shear stress, and heat-transfer distributions along the wall. Of particularconsequence is the high local heat-transfer rate at the reattachment point, whichat hypersonic speeds can peak to an order of magnitude larger than at neigh-boring locations. An example of the effect on the wall pressure distributionis shown in Figure 9.41 a, patterned after the work of Baldwin and Lomax at the NASA Ames Research Center (B. S. Baldwin, and H. Lomax, “Thin LayerApproximation and Algebraic Model for Separated Turbulent Flows,” AIAAPaper No. 78-257, January 1978). Here, the pressure distribution along the wallin the interaction region is plotted versus distance along the wall, x, where x 0is the theoretical point of impingement for the incident shock in the inviscid ﬂowCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 671 0.15 0.100.05 0 Experiment Calculationpw/H20862p0/H11009 /H110026 /H110024 /H1100220246 x /H11002 x0 /H92540 (a) /H9270w N/m2200 160120 8040 0 /H1100240/H1100280 /H11002120 /H110026 /H110024 /H1100220246 x /H11002 x 0 /H92540 (b) Figure 9.41 Effects of shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction on ( a) pressure distribution, and (b ) shear stress for Mach 3 turbulent ﬂow over a ﬂat plate. case. The pressure distribution shows a steplike increase, with an intermediate plateau; this distribution is typical of the shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction.The external ﬂow is at Mach 3 ahead of the incident shock, and the boundary layeris turbulent. The solid curve is a computational ﬂuid dynamic (CFD) calculation,and the circles are experimental data. Notice that the pressure increase extendsa distance equal to about four times the boundary-layer thickness ahead of thetheoretical inviscid impingement point. The shear stress distribution is shown inFigure 9.41b . In the pocket of separated ﬂow, τ wbecomes small and reverses its direction (negative values of τw)due to the low energy recirculating ﬂow. Because of the consequent creation of separated ﬂow, increased loss of total pressure, and high peak heat-transfer rates, shock-wave/boundary-layer interac-tions usually should be avoided as much as possible in the design of supersonicaircraft and ﬂow devices. However, this is easier said than done. Shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions are a fact of life in the practical world of supersonicﬂow, and that is why we have discussed their basic nature in this section. On theother hand, modern creative ideas have led to the beneﬁcial use of the separatedﬂow from a shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction to actually enhance the off-design performance of jet-engine exhaust nozzles and for certain types of ﬂowcontrol. So the picture is not entirely black. 9.11 HISTORICAL NOTE: ERNST MACH—A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH The Mach number is named in honor of Ernst Mach, an Austrian physicist andphilosopher who was an illustrious and controversial ﬁgure in late nineteenth-century physics. Mach conducted the ﬁrst meaningful experiments in supersonicﬂight, and his results triggered a similar interest in Ludwig Prandtl 20 years later.672 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Who was Mach? What did he actually accomplish in supersonic aerodynamics? Let us look at this man further. Mach was born at Turas, Moravia, in Austria, on February 18, 1838. His father, Johann, was a student of classical literature who settled with his family on a farmin 1840. An extreme individualist, Johann raised his family in an atmosphere ofseclusion, working on various improved methods of farming, including silkwormcultivation. Ernst’s mother, on the other hand, came from a family of lawyers anddoctors and brought with her a love of poetry and music. Ernst seemed to thrive inthis family atmosphere. Until the age of 14, his education came exclusively frominstruction by his father, who read extensively in the Greek and Latin classics.In 1853, Mach entered public school, where he became interested in the worldof science. He went on to obtain a Ph.D. in physics in 1860 at the University ofVienna, writing his dissertation on electrical discharge and induction. In 1864, hebecame a full professor of mathematics at the University of Graz and was giventhe title of Professor of Physics in 1866. Mach’s work during this period centeredon optics—a subject which was to interest him for the rest of his life. The year1867 was important for Mach—during that year he married, and he also becamea professor of experimental physics at the University of Prague, a position heheld for the next 28 years. While at Prague, Mach published over 100 technicalpapers—work that was to constitute the bulk of his technical contributions. Mach’s contribution to supersonic aerodynamics involves a series of exper- iments covering the period from 1873 to 1893. In collaboration with his son,Ludwig, Mach studied the ﬂow over supersonic projectiles, as well as the prop-agation of sound waves and shock waves. His work included the ﬂow ﬁeldsassociated with meteorites, explosions, and gas jets. The main experimental datawere photographic results. Mach combined his interest in optics and supersonicmotion by designing several photographic techniques for making shock wavesin air visible. He was the ﬁrst to use the schlieren system in aerodynamics; thissystem senses density gradients and allows shock waves to appear on screens orphotographic negatives. He also devised an interferometric technique that sensesdirectly the change in density in a ﬂow. A pattern of alternate dark and light bandsare set up on a screen by the superposition of light rays passing through regions ofdifferent density. Shock waves are visible as a shift in this pattern along the shock.Mach’s optical device still perpetuates today in the form of the Mach-Zehnderinterferometer, an instrument present in many aerodynamic laboratories. Mach’smajor contributions in supersonic aerodynamics are contained in a paper givento the Academy of Sciences in Vienna in 1887. Here, for the ﬁrst time in history,Mach shows a photograph of a weak wave on a slender cone moving at supersonicspeed, and he demonstrates that the angle μbetween this wave and the direction of ﬂight is given by sin μ=a/V. This angle was later denoted as the Mach angle by Prandtl and his colleagues after their work on shock and expansion waves in1907 and 1908. Also, Mach was the ﬁrst person to point out the discontinuous andmarked changes in a ﬂow ﬁeld as the ratio V/achanges from below 1 to above 1. It is interesting to note that the ratio V/awas not denoted as Mach num- ber by Mach himself. Rather, the term “Mach number” was coined by the SwissCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 673 engineer Jacob Ackeret in his inaugural lecture in 1929 as Privatdozent at the Eidgenossiche Technische Hochschule in Zurich. Hence, the term “Mach num-ber” is of fairly recent usage, not being introduced into the English literature untilthe mid-1930s. In 1895, the University of Vienna established the Ernst Mach chair in the philosophy of inductive sciences. Mach moved to Vienna to occupy this chair. In1897 he suffered a stroke which paralyzed the right side of his body. Although heeventually partially recovered, he ofﬁcially retired in 1901. From that time untilhis death on February 19, 1916 near Munich, Mach continued to be an activethinker, lecturer, and writer. In our time, Mach is most remembered for his early experiments on super- sonic ﬂow and, of course, through the Mach number itself. However, Mach’scontemporaries, as well as Mach himself, viewed him more as a philosopher andhistorian of science. Coming at the end of the nineteenth century, when mostphysicists felt comfortable with newtonian mechanics, and many believed thatvirtually all was known about physics, Mach’s outlook on science is summarizedby the following passage from his book Die Mechanik: The most important result of our reﬂections is that precisely the apparently simplest mechanical theorems are of a very complicated nature; that they are founded onincomplete experiences, even on experiences that never can be fully completed; thatin view of the tolerable stability of our environment they are, in fact, practicallysafeguarded to serve as the foundation of mathematical deduction; but that they byno means themselves can be regarded as mathematically established truths, but only astheorems that not only admit of constant control by experience but actually require it. In other words, Mach was a staunch experimentalist who believed that the es- tablished laws of nature were simply theories and that only observations that areapparent to the senses are the fundamental truth. In particular, Mach could notaccept the elementary ideas of atomic theory or the basis of relativity, both ofwhich were beginning to surface during Mach’s later years and, of course, wereto form the basis of twentieth-century modern physics. As a result, Mach’s phi-losophy did not earn him favor with most of the important physicists of his day.Indeed, at the time of his death, Mach was planning to write a book pointing outthe ﬂaws of Einstein’s theory of relativity. Although Mach’s philosophy was controversial, he was respected for being a thinker. In fact, in spite of Mach’s critical outlook on the theory of relativity,Albert Einstein had the following to say in the year of Mach’s death: “I evenbelieve that those who consider themselves to be adversaries of Mach scarcelyknow how much of Mach’s outlook they have, so to speak, adsorbed with theirmother’s milk.” Hopefully, this section has given you a new dimension to think about when- ever you encounter the term “Mach number.” Maybe you will pause now and thento reﬂect on the man himself and to appreciate that the term “Mach number” is inhonor of a man who devoted his life to experimental physics, but who at the sametime was bold enough to view the physical world through the eyes of a self-styledphilosopher.674 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 9.12 SUMMARY The road map given in Figure 9.6 illustrates the ﬂow of our discussion on oblique waves in supersonic ﬂow. Review this road map, and make certain that you arefamiliar with all the ideas and results that are represented in Figure 9.6. Some of the more important results are summarized as follows: An inﬁnitesimal disturbance in a multidimensional supersonic ﬂow creates aMach wave that makes an angle μwith respect to the upstream velocity. This angle is deﬁned as the Mach angle and is given by μ=sin −11 M(9.1) Changes across an oblique shock wave are determined by the normal compo-nent of velocity ahead of the wave. For a calorically perfect gas, the normalcomponent of the upstream Mach number is the determining factor. Changesacross an oblique shock can be determined from the normal shock relationsderived in Chapter 8 by using M n,1in these relations, where Mn,1=M1sinβ (9.13) Changes across an oblique shock depend on two parameters, for example, M1andβ, orM1andθ. The relationship between M1,β, andθis given in Figure 9.9, which should be studied closely. Oblique shock waves incident on a solid surface reﬂect from that surfacein such a fashion to maintain ﬂow tangency on the surface. Oblique shocksalso intersect each other, with the results of the intersection depending on thearrangement of the shocks. The governing factor in the analysis of a centered expansion wave is thePrandtl-Meyer function ν(M). The key equation which relates the downstream Mach number M 2, the upstream Mach number M1, and the deﬂection angle θis θ=ν(M2)−ν(M1) (9.43) The pressure distribution over a supersonic airfoil made up of straight-linesegments can usually be calculated exactly from a combination of oblique andexpansion waves—that is, from exact shock-expansion theory.CHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 675 9.13 INTEGRATED WORK CHALLENGE: RELATION BETWEEN SUPERSONIC WAVE DRAG AND ENTROPY INCREASE—ISTHERE A RELATION? Concept: Supersonic wave drag on a body is caused by the high pressures that oc- cur behind shock waves acting on the surface of the body. The simplest illustration of this is shown in Figure 9.17 where the high static pressure behind an obliqueshock wave is exerted on the front faces of a wedge, creating a pressure drag; thispressure drag is called wave drag because the high pressure on the surface is due to the presence of shock waves. Indeed, the net aerodynamic force on any body ina ﬂow is the net integral of the pressure and shear stress distributions acting overthe surface, as explained in Section 1.5. In a supersonic ﬂow, the airﬂow adjacentto the surface of the body is processed through systems of shock and expansionwaves, and the resulting surface pressure is a product of the ﬂow through thesewaves. The net integral of the resulting surface pressure distribution in the dragdirection yields a drag force that is labeled wave drag. This straightforward concept relates surface pressure distributions to a force on a body; it is the most fundamental source of wave drag. However, is thereanother way of looking at how nature generates wave drag? Is there an alternativeexplanation? We recall our discussion in Section 3.22 about the relation betweendrag and the loss of total pressure in the ﬂow. In Chapter 8 we saw a relationbetween loss of total pressure in ﬂow and a corresponding entropy increase inthe ﬂow, as expressed by Equation (8.73). This leads to the question: Is therea relation between the generation of wave drag on a supersonic body and theincrease in entropy of the ﬂow over the body? Challenge: Investigate this question. Solution: Return to the discussion in Section 2.6 dealing with the application of the momentum equation to the drag of a two-dimensional body and to the con- trol volume sketched in Figure 2.20a. Let us imagine a supersonic ﬂow throughthe control volume and an aerodynamic body inside the control volume generat-ing a system of shock and expansion waves. These waves will propagate aboveand below the body in the general downstream direction, as sketched in Fig-ure 9.42. If the upper and lower boundaries of the control volume are drawnfar enough away from the body, the waves will exit only through the down-stream boundary, as seen in Figure 9.42. The static pressure is constant over theupstream and upper and lower boundaries. Assume that the downstream bound-ary is taken far enough downstream of the body such that the mutual interac-tion of the shock and expansion waves yield an approximately constant pressure over that boundary (not precisely the case, but reasonable enough for our dis-cussion here). Recall that the ﬂuid dynamic derivation in Section 2.6 was fora general ﬂow. Therefore, Equations (2.78) and (2.79) apply for both incom-pressible and compressible ﬂows, and the drag on the body in Figure 9.42 is676 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow ab ihV/H11009p/H11009p/H11009 p/H11009p/H11009 p/H11009p p/H11009 Figure 9.42 Control volume around a body in supersonic ﬂow, with the shock wave exiting the downstream boundary. given by D/prime=/integraldisplaya iρ1u2 1dy−/integraldisplayb hρ2u22dy (C9.1) From Equation (8.42) p0 p=/parenleftbigg 1+γ−1 2M2/parenrightbiggγ γ−1 Hence, 1+γ−1 2M2=/parenleftbiggp0 p/parenrightbiggγ−1 γ M2=2 γ−1/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbiggp0 p/parenrightbiggγ−1 γ −1/bracketrightBigg (C9.2) Since M=u a,Equation (9.2) becomes u2=2a2 γ−1/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbiggp0 p/parenrightbiggγ−1 γ −1/bracketrightBiggCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 677 Also, a2=γRT Thus, u2=2γRT γ−1/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbiggp0 p/parenrightbiggγ−1 γ −1/bracketrightBigg and ρu2=2γρRT γ−1/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbiggp0 p/parenrightbiggγ−1 γ −1/bracketrightBigg (C9.3) Since p=ρRT, Equation (C9.3) becomes ρu2=2γp γ−1/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbiggp0 p/parenrightbiggγ−1 γ −1/bracketrightBigg (C9.4) Return to Equation (C9.1) and Figure 9.42.

Note that when entropy increases, i.e., /Delta1sis positive, the magnitude of the ﬁrst term on the right side of Equation (C9.9) increases and the magnitude of the second term decreases, both of which serve to increase the drag, D/prime!Also note that for an isentropic ﬂow, /Delta1s=0,p02=p01. And we already have from Equation (9.42) that p1=p2; in this case, Equa- tion (9.9) yields D/prime=0, i.e., for an isentropic ﬂow, there is no wave drag, as we already know from physical considerations. In summary, Equation (9.9) demonstrates the connection between wave drag and an increase of entropy in the ﬂow. The two go hand in hand; in a supersonicﬂow over a body the wave drag on the body is related to the entropy increase inthe ﬂow. 9.14 INTEGRATED WORK CHALLENGE: THE SONIC BOOM Concept: In popular culture, the sonic boom is understood to be a loud “boom” that one hears when an airplane ﬂying overhead breaks the speed of sound. Inreality, however, one hears a “sonic boom” whenever an airplane, or any ﬂightvehicle, ﬂies overhead at speeds faster than sound, no matter where the vehicleactually ﬁrst started ﬂying at supersonic speeds; indeed, that could have occurreda thousand miles away. So, just what is the sonic boom? Challenge: Examine the sonic boom generated from a body in supersonic ﬂight. What is it? How is it created? How can its strength be reduced?Solution: Return to Figure 9.37 illustrating the wave pattern from a diamond- wedge airfoil at supersonic speeds. Imagine this body ﬂying overheard. The wave pattern from the bottom of the airfoil propagates toward the ground, and whenit sweeps past you standing on the ground, your eardrums pick up the pressurechanges across the waves, creating a booming sound. What you hear is the “sonicboom.” The body is dragging this wave pattern with it as it ﬂies through theatmosphere, and hence the “sonic boom” is sweeping over the ground at the samespeed as the body is ﬂying through the air. Examining Figure 9.37 in more detail, note that two shock waves are pro- duced, one at the nose of the body, and one at the tail of the body. These twoshocks propagate downward with the expansion wave contained between them,as illustrated in Figure 9.43. Also shown in Figure 9.43 is the change in pressure,/Delta1pthrough the wave pattern. At large distances below the body, the variation in/Delta1pshows a jump increase across the bow wave, an almost linear decrease between the bow and tail waves, and another jump increase across the tail wave.The variation of /Delta1pthrough the wave pattern resembles the capital letter N, and for this reason the sonic boom pressure wave is called an “N-wave.” Notethat when this N-wave sweeps past you on the ground, you hear two boomsseparated in time by /Delta1t=λ/V ∞, where λis the distance along the groundCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 679 /H9004p /H9261Bow waveTail wave Figure 9.43 Classic N-wave sonic boom generation. between the bow and tail waves, and V∞is the ﬂight velocity of the supersonic body. In this case, what you hear as the “sonic boom” is in reality two booms very closely spaced in time, the so-called classic double-boom signature. Forexample, the Concorde supersonic transport cruised at a Mach number of 2 at50,000 ft, where the standard atmospheric temperature is 390 ◦R. The speed of sound at this temperature is a=√γRT=√(1.4)(1716)(390) =968 ft/s, hence V∞=(968)(2) =1936 ft/s. Assume the distance across the N-wave at ground level is 200 ft. Then the time interval between the two booms would be/Delta1t=λ/V ∞=200/1936 =0.103 s. This is equivalent to the response time sensed by the human ear, and therefore two distinct booms will be heard, thedouble-boom. However, if /Delta1tis shorter, the average ear cannot distinguish be- tween the two pulses shown in Figure 9.43, and the sonic boom will be heard asonly one boom. The most critical aspect of the sonic boom is the environmental impact caused by the magnitude of /Delta1pfelt on the ground. In the early days of supersonic ﬂight, the sonic booms generated by airplanes sometimes exceeded an increase inpressure greater than /Delta1p=2 lb/ft 2, greatly affecting human health and causing structural damage (broken windows, cracked walls, etc.). At the time of the designof the Concorde SST during the 1960s, a maximum value of /Delta1p=2 lb/ft 2was considered acceptable. This was an error in judgment because soon after theConcorde went into service with British Airways and Air France, nations all overthe world (including the United States) began to ban supersonic ﬂight of theConcorde over land, severely hurting the economic value of the airplane. At thetime of writing, such bans on overland supersonic ﬂight are still in effect. This situation is a critical inhibitor to the design and operation of a second- generation SST, thus promoting extensive research on how to mitigate the strengthof the sonic boom. In this situation, aerospace engineers are really ﬁghting MotherNature; shock waves are a natural consequence of supersonic ﬂight, and it appears680 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 9.44 Planform of a generic low-boom fuselage, wing, and tail supersonic airplane. that the most direct way of mitigating the strength of the sonic boom is to mitigate the strength of the shock waves causing the sonic boom. As aerospace engineers,we know how to approach this problem. From the wave theory discussed in thepresent chapter, clearly, sharp-nosed slender bodies will generate weaker shockwaves than blunter-nosed thicker bodies. Also, expansion waves generated overportions of the body can interact with, and weaken, shock waves. So aerodynamicshaping of the supersonic vehicle is a ﬁrst line of attack on the sonic boom problem. This leads to the generic low-boom fuselage, wings, tails arrangementsketched in Figure 9.44, with a long, slender fuselage; pointed nose; sharp leading-edge wings and tails; and a necking-down of the fuselage in the region of thewings in order to create favorable expansion waves following a type of supersonic“area rule.” The purpose of this shaping is to reduce the magnitude of /Delta1pto an environmentally acceptable level. There is another, companion approach to mitigating the sonic boom. Re- ferring again to Figure 9.43, an aspect of the severity of the sonic boom is thesharpness at which /Delta1ptakes place, i.e., the suddenness over which the rise in pressure takes place, which may be as short as 100 microseconds. It is this sud-denness in combination with the magnitude of /Delta1pthat can be unacceptable. In his excellent book Shock Waves and Man, University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies, 1974, author Irvine Glass notes that a change in pressure of2 lb/ft 2can readily be sensed by running up or down three ﬂights of stairs, but because the rise time is so gentle our ears are not affected. So another approach tomaking the sonic boom more acceptable is to smooth out the sharp peak in /Delta1p, and once again this can be achieved by shaping the ﬂight vehicle. Indeed, NASAand the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) have carried outsuch experiments using a specially modiﬁed Northrop F-5E ﬁghter. The shape ofthe nose of the airplane was modiﬁed to have a ﬂat top and a curved bottom, asgenerically sketched in Figure 9.45. The expansion wave from the curved bottomsurface interacts with the bow shock wave in a fashion that smooths the sharpincrease in /Delta1p, as sketched in Figure 9.46, based on experimental measurements of the sonic boom shape generated by the modiﬁed F-5E. Note that the peak in/Delta1pfrom the bow shock has been reduced from 1.2 lb/ft 2to 0.8 lb/ft2and theCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 681 Flat top Curved bottom Figure 9.45 Schematic of a supersonic vehicle with a nose shape to produce a shaped sonic boom. 0.12 0.6 /H110020.6 /H110021.20Baseline F-5E/H9004p, lb/H20862ft2 0 Time, milliseconds100Modified F-5E Figure 9.46 Comparison of a classic sonic boom signature (generated by a baseline F-5E aircraft) with a shaped boom signature (generated by amodiﬁed F-5E with a curved-bottom nose). shape has been smoothed over a time interval of 20 milliseconds, creating what some researchers call a “thump” rather than a boom. The mitigation of the sonic boom remains one of the most critical aspects of future commercial supersonic ﬂight, and at the time of writing no deﬁnitivesolution has yet been obtained. In the meantime, wind tunnel experiments andﬂight tests continue on conﬁgurations intended to point the way to a solution.Also, computational ﬂuid dynamic codes are being developed for calculatingboth the near ﬁeld and far ﬁeld structures of the sonic boom. The solution tothe sonic boom problem is still a work in progress—stay tuned. Finally, for anextensive survey of the state of the art, see Sonic Boom: Six Decades of Research, by D. J. Maglieri, P. J. Bobbitt, K. J. Plotkin, K. P. Shepherd, P. G. Coen, andD. M. Richwine, NASA SP 2014-622. 9.15 PROBLEMS 9.1A slender missile is ﬂying at Mach 1.5 at low altitude.

The upstream pressure and temperature are 2.65 ×104N/m2and 223.3 K, respectively (corresponding to a standard altitude of 10,000 m). Calculate the pressure, temperature, Mach number, total pressure, and totaltemperature behind the wave and the entropy increase across the wave. 9.3Equation (8.80) does nothold for an oblique shock wave, and hence the column in Appendix B labeled p 0,2/p1cannot be used, in conjunction with the normal component of the upstream Mach number, to obtain thetotal pressure behind an oblique shock wave. On the other hand, thecolumn labeled p 0,2/p0,1can be used for an oblique shock wave, using Mn,1. Explain why all this is so. 9.4Consider an oblique shock wave with a wave angle of 36.87◦. The upstream ﬂow is given by M1=3 and p1=1 atm.

We wish to slow thisﬂow to subsonic speed through a system of shock waves with as small aloss in total pressure as possible. Compare the loss in total pressure for thefollowing three shock systems: a. A single normal shock wave b. An oblique shock with a deﬂection angle of 25.3 ◦, followed by a normal shock c. An oblique shock with a deﬂection angle of 25.3◦, followed by a second oblique shock of deﬂection angle of 20◦, followed by a normal shock From the results of (a),(b), and (c), what can you induce about the efﬁciency of the various shock systems? 9.9Consider an oblique shock generated at a compression corner with adeﬂection angle θ=18.2 ◦. A straight horizontal wall is present above the corner, as shown in Figure 9.19. If the upstream ﬂow has the propertiesCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 683 M1=3.2, p1=1 atm and T1=520◦R, calculate M3,p3, and T3behind the reﬂected shock from the upper wall. Also, obtain the angle /Phi1which the reﬂected shock makes with the upper wall. 9.10 Consider the supersonic ﬂow over an expansion corner, such as given in Figure 9.25. The deﬂection angle θ=23.38◦. If the ﬂow upstream of the corner is given by M1=2,p1=0.7 atm, T1=630◦R, calculate M2,p2, T2,ρ2,p0,2, and T0,2downstream of the corner. Also, obtain the angles the forward and rearward Mach lines make with respect to the upstreamdirection. 9.11 A supersonic ﬂow at M 1=1.58 and p1=1 atm expands around a sharp corner. If the pressure downstream of the corner is 0.1306 atm, calculatethe deﬂection angle of the corner. 9.12 A supersonic ﬂow at M 1=3,T1=285 K, and p1=1 atm is deﬂected upward through a compression corner with θ=30.6◦and then is subsequently expanded around a corner of the same angle such that theﬂow direction is the same as its original direction. Calculate M 3,p3, and T3downstream of the expansion corner. Since the resulting ﬂow is in the same direction as the original ﬂow, would you expect M3=M1,p3=p1, andT3=T1?

Calculate the maximum deﬂection angle throughwhich this ﬂow can be expanded via a centered expansion wave. 9.16 Consider a circular cylinder (oriented with its axis perpendicular to theﬂow) and a symmetric diamond-wedge airfoil with a half-angle of 5 ◦at zero angle of attack; both bodies are in the same Mach 5 freestream. Thethickness of the airfoil and the diameter of the cylinder are the same. Thedrag coefﬁcient (based on projected frontal area) of the cylinder is 4/3.Calculate the ratio of the cylinder drag to the diamond airfoil drag. What does this say about the aerodynamic performance of a blunt bodycompared to a sharp-nosed slender body in supersonic ﬂow? 9.17 Consider the supersonic ﬂow over a ﬂat plate at an angle of attack, assketched in Figure 9.35. As stated in Section 9.7, the ﬂow directiondownstream of the trailing edge of the plate, behind the trailing edgeshock and expansion waves, is not precisely in the freestream direction.Why? Outline a method to calculate the strengths of the trailing edgeshock and expansion waves, and the direction of the ﬂow downstream ofthe trailing edge.684 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 9.18 (The purpose of this problem is to calculate a two-dimensional expanding supersonic ﬂow and compare it with the analogous quasi-one-dimensionalﬂow in Problem 10.15.) Consider a two-dimensional duct with a straighthorizontal lower wall, and a straight upper wall inclined upward throughthe angle θ=3 ◦. The height of the duct entrance is 0.3 m. A uniform horizontal ﬂow at Mach 2 enters the duct and goes through aPrandtl-Mayer expansion wave centered at the top corner of the entrance.The wave propagates to the bottom wall, where the leading edge (theforward Mach line) of the wave intersects the bottom wall at point A located at distance x Afrom the duct entrance. Imagine a line drawn perpendicular to the lower wall at point A, and intersecting the upper wall at point B. The local height of the duct at point Ais the length of this line AB. Calculate the average ﬂow Mach number over AB, assuming that M varies linearly along that portion of ABinside the expansion wave. 9.19 Repeat Problem 9.18, except with θ=30◦. Again, we will use these results to compare with a quasi-one-dimensional calculation inProblem 10.16. The reason for repeating this calculation is to examine theeffect of the much more highly two-dimensional ﬂow generated in thiscase by a much larger expansion angle. 9.20 Consider a Mach 3 ﬂow at 1 atm pressure initially moving over a ﬂathorizontal surface. The ﬂow then encounters a 20 degree expansioncorner, followed by a 20 degree compression corner that turns the ﬂowback to the horizontal. Calculate the pressure of the ﬂow downstream ofthe compression corner. Note: You will ﬁnd that the pressure downstream of the compression corner is different from the pressure upstream of theexpansion corner, even though the upstream and downstream ﬂows are inthe same direction, namely horizontal. Why? 9.21 The purpose of this problem is to explain what causes the dramatic whitecloud pattern generated in the ﬂow ﬁeld over the F/A-18C Hornet shownon the cover of this book. This problem is both a tutorial and a quantitativecalculation involving the reader. We ﬁrst discuss some necessarythermodynamic background, followed by an examination of the physicalnature of the ﬂow ﬁeld. Necessary Thermodynamic Background The white cloud surrounding the F/A-18C Hornet is condensed water vapor in the airﬂow over the airplane. Inside the cloud, water appears intwo phases, vapor and liquid. Both inside and outside the cloud, themedium is a mixture of air and water; outside the cloud the water iscompletely in vapor form, and inside the cloud there is a mixture of air,water vapor, and condensed liquid water. Both inside and outside thecloud, the gas pressure pis the sum of the partial pressure of air and the much smaller partial pressure of water vapor, p airandpH2O, respectively; i.e.,p=pair+pH2O. On a graph of pH2Oversus temperature for thisCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 685 water-air mixture, we can construct a type of “phase diagram,” where over part of this diagram the water is in the vapor phase only, and over anotherpart the water is a liquid-vapor mixture. The curve dividing these tworegions is called the saturation curve, which arches upward toward theright (on the saturation curve, p H2Oincreases with increasing temperature, with the slope of this curve, dpH2O/dT, increasing as Tincreases). To the right of this curve, the water is completely vapor, and to the left of thiscurve, the water is a mixture of vapor and liquid. What we see as the whitecloud over the top of the F/A-18C Hornet is light reﬂecting from thecondensed droplets of water; i.e., the white cloud is that region of theairﬂow that is in the liquid-vapor region of the phase diagram, namely thatregion to the left of the saturation curve. Every point on the saturation curve corresponds to 100 percent relative humidity in the ambient air. The temperature at each point on thecurve is the “dew-point” temperature. In the region to the right of thiscurve the air is at less than 100 percent humidity, the temperature isgreater than the dew point, and there is no condensation of the watervapor. In the region to the left of the curve, the temperature falls below thedew point and condensation starts to occur. The saturation curve is obtained experimentally. For this problem, we use the saturation curve for an ambient pressure of 1 atm found on page4-86 of Marks’ Mechanical Engineer’s Handbook , 6th Ed., McGraw-Hill, 1958 (we use an older edition because it is on the author’s personal bookshelf and therefore handy). This is a curve of p H2Oversus Tfor air at 100 percent relative humidity with an ambient pressure of 1 atm. For this problem, let us choose a particular point on this saturation curve, namely the point where T=520◦R and pH2O=38.16 lb/ft2. Call this point A. At point A, air has 100 percent humidity and contains an amount of water vapor corresponding to a partial pressure of pH2O=38.16 lb/ft2. The slope of the curve, dpH2O/dT, at point Ais important to this problem. The slope is dpH2O/dT=1.08 lb/(ft2·◦R) saturation curve Nature of the Flow ﬁeld The F/A-18C Hornet on the cover of this book is ﬂying supersonically at a small angle of attack; note that the trailing wing-tip vortices, also madevisible by water condensation, are very thin and tightly wound,characteristic of tip vortices in a supersonic ﬂow. Expansion waves occurover the top surface of the wings and fuselage. The expansion region isterminated by a trailing-edge shock wave. The objective of this problem isto prove that water condensation occurs within the expansion wave, butthat the water goes back to the purely vapor phase when it passes throughthe trailing-edge shock wave. We submit that the white cloud shownaround the F/A-18C Hornet is caused by water condensation within the686 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow expansion wave, and that the rather sharp termination of the cloud is caused by water evaporation when the ﬂow passes through thetrailing-edge shock wave. For a simpliﬁed model of this ﬂow, consider the ﬂat plate at an angle-of-attack in a supersonic ﬂow as sketched in Figure 9.36. Thesupersonic ﬂow over the top surface of the plate ﬁrst goes through anexpansion wave, then passes through the trailing-edge shock wavedownstream. If the freestream upstream of the plate has sufﬁciently highhumidity, a white cloud of condensed water vapor will form through anddownstream of the expansion wave. However, the white cloud willdisappear when the condensed water vapor is vaporized as the ﬂow passesthrough the trailing-edge shock wave. So in Figure 9.36, the white cloudwill occur in the region bounded upstream by the expansion wave, anddownstream by the trailing-edge shock wave. This simulates the nature ofthe white cloud seen over the top of the F/A-18C Hornet on the cover ofthis book. Statement of the Problem Consider the ﬂow ﬁeld sketched in Figure 9.36. Assume the supersonic freestream is at a temperature of 520 ◦R and a pressure of 1 atm, and that it has 100 percent humidity. Therefore, the thermodynamic state of thefreestream corresponds to point Aon the saturation curve of the phase diagram discussed earlier. (a) Prove that a ﬂuid element from the freestream, when passing into the expansion wave, will experience water condensation. (b) Prove that a ﬂuid element already within and downstream of the expansion wave and hence with some condensed water, willexperience water evaporation when passing through the trailing-edgeshock wave. Comment and Hint Well, you might say this is obvious. When the ﬂow expands through the expansion wave, the temperature decreases, and water will obviouslycondense. Hence the ﬂuid element in the phase diagram will obviouslypenetrate through point Aand enter the liquid-vapor region. But wait a minute! When the ﬂuid element enters the expansion wave, both its temperature and pressure will decrease. The temperature decrease, byitself, will move the properties of the ﬂuid element toward the left ofpoint Ainto the liquid-vapor region, but the pressure decrease by itself will move the properties of the ﬂuid element vertically downward frompoint A, farther away from the liquid-vapor region. The question is: Which change is more dominant, the temperature decrease or the pressuredecease? This is for you to ﬁnd out. As a hint, calculate the value of thederivative dp H2O/dT for the ﬂuid element as it enters the expansionCHAPTER 9Oblique Shock and Expansion Waves 687 wave. If this derivative is smaller than the slope of the saturation curve at point A, given earlier as dpH2O/dT=1.08 lb/(ft2·◦R), then the properties of the ﬂuid element as it enters the expansion wave will alsopenetrate across point Ainto the liquid-vapor part of the phase diagram, and clearly water condensation will then occur. Similarly, for a ﬂuid element crossing the shock wave, you might also say that it is obvious that condensed water in the ﬂuid element willevaporate because the temperature increases across the shock, whichcauses evaporation. But again, wait a minute! Consider that the propertiesof the ﬂuid element just in front of the shock wave are in the liquid-vaporregion just to the left of point A.Both the temperature and pressure will increase across the shock wave. The increase in temperature will move theproperties of the ﬂuid to the right of point A, away from the liquid-vapor region and into the purely vapor region, but the increase in pressure willmove the properties of the ﬂuid element vertically upward from point A, farther into the liquid-vapor region. Again, the question is: Which changeis more dominant, the temperature increase or the pressure increase? Thisis for you to ﬁnd out. As a hint, calculate the value dp H2O/dT≈/Delta1pH2O/ /Delta1Tacross the shock wave. If this derivative is smaller than the slope of the saturation curve at point A, given earlier as dpH2O/dT=1.08 lb/ (ft2·◦R), then the properties of the ﬂuid element as it crosses the shock wave will also exit the liquid-vapor phase at point Aand enter the purely vapor region, and clearly evaporation will take place. To calculate/Delta1p H2O//Delta1T, you have to arbitrarily assume the strength of the shock wave. Assume the shock is a normal shock wave with an upstream Mach numberof 1.2, and the upstream properties of the ﬂow are those just minutely tothe left of point A; i.e., assume ahead of the shock wave M 1=1.2, p1=2116 lb/ft2, and pH2O=38.16 lb/ft2. Answers (a) When the ﬂuid element enters the expansion wave, dpH2O/dT= 0.256 lb/(ft2·◦R). This is a smaller slope than that of the saturation curve at point A. The properties of the ﬂuid will penetrate into the liquid-vapor region, and condensation will occur. (b) When the ﬂuid element in front of the shock wave with properties just inside the liquid-vapor region at point Acrosses the shock wave, /Delta1pH2O//Delta1T=0.2923 lb/(ft2·◦R). This is a smaller slope than that of the saturation curve at point A. The properties of the ﬂuid element will penetrate into the purely vapor region, and evaporation willoccur.CHAPTER10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers,and Wind Tunnels Having wondered from what source there is so much difﬁculty in successfully applying the principles of dynamics to ﬂuids than to solids, ﬁnally, turning thematter over more carefully in my mind, I found the true origin of the difﬁculty;I discovered it to consist of the fact that a certain part of the pressing forcesimportant in forming the throat (so called by me, not considered by others) was neglected, and moreover regarded as if of no importance, for no other reasonthan the throat is composed of a very small, or even an inﬁnitely small, quantityof ﬂuid, such as occurs whenever ﬂuid passes from a wider place to a narrower,or vice versa, from a narrower to a wider. Johann Bernoulli; from hisHydraulics, 1743 PREVIEW BOX One of the best examples of the harnessing of na- ture by aerospace engineers is shown in Figure 10.1,which is a photograph of the main rocket engine for thespace shuttle. This engine produces over 400,000 lbof thrust. The laws of nature have been used byaerospace engineers to design this engine. But whatlaws of nature? Take another look at Figure 10.1,and note the large bell-like divergent nozzle of therocket engine. Why this shape instead of some con-vergent shape like the low-speed wind tunnel nozzlesdiscussed in Section 3.3? In reality, in Figure 10.1,we are seeing only part of the rocket nozzle; hid-den behind all the plumbing to the left of the diver-gent duct in Figure 10.1 is a combustion chamberthat feeds the hot, high-pressure gas into a conver-gent duct that transitions to the divergent duct seen in 689690 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 10.1 Space shuttle main rocket engine (NASA). Figure 10.1. The whole rocket engine nozzle, from the combustion chamber to the exit, is a convergent–divergent shape such as sketched in Figure 10.2.Why? The answers to these questions and more are given in the present chapter. Here we deal withtheinternal ﬂow of a high-speed compressible gas through ducts of various shapes. The material in thischapter is essential to the design of rocket engines, jetengines, supersonic and hypersonic wind tunnels, andany ﬂow device that involves the compressible ﬂowof a gas internal to the device. We labeled the studyCombustion chamber Convergent-divergent rocket nozzle Figure 10.2 Schematic of rocket engine nozzle. of shock waves in the previous two chapters as thebread and butter of compressible ﬂow. By compari-son, the study of the ﬂow through nozzles, diffusers,and wind tunnels in the present chapter is the rolls andjam of compressible ﬂow. Applications of the mate-rial in this chapter are made daily in the modern worldof aerospace engineering. Moreover, this material ispacked with interesting physical phenomena, some ofwhich you likely have not thought about before andwhich you will ﬁnd almost amazing in some instances.Take this chapter very seriously. I predict that you willﬁnd it enjoyable and rewarding. 10.1 INTRODUCTION Chapters 8 and 9 treated normal and oblique waves in supersonic ﬂow. These waves are present on any aerodynamic vehicle in supersonic ﬂight. Aeronauticalengineers are concerned with observing the characteristics of such vehicles, es-pecially the generation of lift and drag at supersonic speeds, as well as details ofthe ﬂow ﬁeld, including the shock- and expansion-wave patterns. To make suchobservations, we usually have two standard choices: (1) conduct ﬂight tests usingthe actual vehicle, and (2) run wind-tunnel tests on a small-scale model of thevehicle. Flight tests, although providing the ﬁnal answers in the full-scale envi-ronment, are costly and, not to say the least, dangerous if the vehicle is unproven.Hence, the vast bulk of supersonic aerodynamic data have been obtained in windtunnels on the ground. What do such supersonic wind tunnels look like? How doCHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 691 Figure 10.3 The ﬁrst practical supersonic wind tunnel, built by A. Busemann in Germany in the mid-1930s. (Courtesy of John Anderson). we produce a uniform ﬂow of supersonic gas in a laboratory environment? What are the characteristics of supersonic wind tunnels? The answers to these and otherquestions are addressed in this chapter. The ﬁrst practical supersonic wind tunnel was built and operated by Adolf Busemann in Germany in the mid-1930s, although Prandtl had a small supersonicfacility operating as early as 1905 for the study of shock waves. A photograph ofBusemann’s tunnel is shown in Figure 10.3. Such facilities proliferated quicklyduring and after World War II. Today, all modern aerodynamic laboratories haveone or more supersonic wind tunnels, and many are equipped with hypersonictunnels as well. Such machines come in all sizes; an example of a moderatelylarge hypersonic tunnel is shown in Figure 10.4. In this chapter, we discuss the aerodynamic fundamentals of compressible ﬂow through ducts. Such fundamentals are vital to the proper design of high-speedwind tunnels, rocket engines, high-energy gas-dynamic and chemical lasers, andjet engines, to list just a few. Indeed, the material developed in this chapter isused almost daily by practicing aerodynamicists and is indispensable toward afull understanding of compressible ﬂow. The road map for this chapter is given in Figure 10.5. After deriving the governing equations, we treat the cases of a nozzle and diffuser separately. Thenwe merge this information to examine the case of supersonic wind tunnels.692 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 10.4 A large hypersonic wind tunnel at the U.S. Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratory, Dayton, Ohio. (NASA). Figure 10.5 Road map for Chapter 10. 10.2 GOVERNING EQUATIONS FOR QUASI-ONE-DIMENSIONAL FLOW Recall the one-dimensional ﬂow treated in Chapter 8. There, we considered the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables to be a function of xonly, that is, p=p(x),u=u(x), etc. Strictly speaking, a streamtube for such a ﬂow must be of constant area; that is, theCHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 693 Figure 10.6 One-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional ﬂows. one-dimensional ﬂow discussed in Chapter 8 is constant-area ﬂow, as sketched in Figure 10.6 a. In contrast, assume that the area of the streamtube changes as a function ofx, that is, A=A(x), as sketched in Figure 10.6b . Strictly speaking, this ﬂow is three-dimensional; the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables are functions of x,y, and z, as can be seen simply by examining Figure 10.6b . In particular, the velocity at the boundary of the streamtube must be tangent to the boundary, and hence it hascomponents in the yandzdirections as well as the axial xdirection. However, if the area variation is moderate, the components in the yandzdirections are small in comparison with the component in the xdirection. In such a case, the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables can be assumed to vary with xonly (i.e., the ﬂow can be assumed to be uniform across any cross section at a given xstation). Such a ﬂow, where A=A(x), but p=p(x),ρ=ρ(x),u=u(x), etc., is deﬁned asquasi-one-dimensional ﬂow, as sketched in Figure 10.6b . Such ﬂow is the subject of this chapter. We have encountered quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow earlier,in our discussion of incompressible ﬂow through a duct in Section 3.3. Return toSection 3.3, and review the concepts presented there before progressing further. Although the assumption of quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow is an approximation to the actual ﬂow in a variable-area duct, the integral forms of the conservationequations, namely, continuity [Equation (2.48)], momentum [Equation (2.64)],and energy [Equation (2.95)], can be used to obtain governing equations forquasi-one-dimensional ﬂow which are physically consistent, as follows. Considerthe control volume given in Figure 10.7. At station 1, the ﬂow across area A 1is assumed to be uniform with properties p1,ρ1,u1, etc. Similarly, at station 2, the ﬂow across area A2is assumed to be uniform with properties p2,ρ2,u2, etc. The application of the integral form of the continuity equation was made to such avariable-area control volume in Section 3.3. The resulting continuity equation forsteady, quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow was obtained as Equation (3.21), which interms of the nomenclature in Figure 10.7 yields ρ1u1A1=ρ2u2A2 (10.1)694 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 10.7 Finite control volume for quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow. Consider the integral form of the momentum equation, Equation (2.64). For a steady, inviscid ﬂow with no body forces, this equation becomes ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)V=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SpdS (10.2) Since Equation (10.2) is a vector equation, let us examine its xcomponent, given below: ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(ρV·dS)u=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay S(pdS)x (10.3) where (pdS)xdenotes the xcomponent of the pressure force. Since Equa- tion (10.3) is a scalar equation, we must be careful about the sign of the xcom- ponents when evaluating the surface integrals. All components pointing to the right in Figure 10.7 are positive, and those pointing to the left are negative. Theupper and lower surfaces of the control volume in Figure 10.7 are streamlines;hence, V·dS=0 along these surfaces. Also, recall that across A 1,VanddSare in opposite directions; hence, V·dSis negative. Therefore, the integral on the left of Equation (10.3) becomes −ρ 1u2 1A1+ρ2u22A2. The pressure integral on the right of Equation (10.2), evaluated over the faces A1andA2of the control volume, becomes −(− p1A1+p2A2). (The negative sign in front of p1Ais because dS over A1points to the left, which is the negative direction for the xcomponents.) Evaluated over the upper and lower surface of the control volume, the pressure integral can be expressed as −/integraldisplayA2 A1−pdA=/integraldisplayA2 A1pdA (10.4) where dAis simply the xcomponent of the vector dS, that is, the area dSprojected on a plane perpendicular to the xaxis. The negative sign inside the integral on the left of Equation (10.4) is due to the direction of dSalong the upper and lower surfaces; note that dSpoints in the backward direction along these surfaces, as shown in Figure 10.7. Hence, the xcomponent of pdSis to the left, and thereforeCHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 695 appears in our equations as a negative component. [Recall from Section 2.5 that the negative sign outside the pressure integral, that is, outside the integral on the left of Equation (10.4), is always present to account for the physical fact that the pressureforce pdSexerted on a control surface always acts in the opposite direction of dS. If you are unsure about this, review the derivation of the momentum equationin Section 2.5. Also, do not let the signs in the above results confuse you; theyare all quite logical if you keep track of the direction of the xcomponents.] With the above results, Equation (10.3) becomes −ρ 1u2 1A1+ρ2u22A2=−(−p1A1+p2A2)+/integraldisplayA2 A1pdA p1A1+ρ1u21A1+/integraldisplayA2 A1pdA=p2A2+ρ2u22A2 (10.5) Equation (10.5) is the momentum equation for steady, quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow. Consider the energy equation given by Equation (2.95). For inviscid, adia- batic, steady ﬂow with no body forces, this equation becomes ................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Sρ/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg V·dS=−................................................................................/integraldisplay/integraldisplay SpV·dS (10.6) Applied to the control volume in Figure 10.7, Equation (10.6) yields ρ1/parenleftbigg e1+u2 1 2/parenrightbigg (−u 1A1)+ρ2/parenleftbigg e2+u22 2/parenrightbigg (u2A2)=−(−p1u1A1+p2u2A2) or p1u1A1+ρ1u1A1/parenleftbigg e1+u21 2/parenrightbigg =p2u2A2+ρ2u2A2/parenleftbigg e2+u22 2/parenrightbigg (10.7) Dividing Equation (10.7) by Equation (10.1), we have p1 ρ1+e1+u21 2=p2 ρ2+e2+u22 2(10.8) Recall that h=e+pv=e+p/ρ. Hence, Equation (10.8) becomes h1+u21 2=h2+u22 2(10.9) which is the energy equation for steady, adiabatic, inviscid quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow. Examine Equation (10.9) closely; it is a statement that the total enthalpy, h0=h+u2/2, is a constant throughout the ﬂow. Once again, this should come as no surprise; Equation (10.9) is simply another example of the general result forsteady, inviscid, adiabatic ﬂow discussed in Section 7.5. Hence, we can replaceEquation (10.9) by h0=const (10.10)696 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Pause for a moment and examine our results given above. We have applied the integral forms of the conservation equations to the control volume in Figure 10.5. We have obtained, as a result, Equations (10.1), (10.5), and (10.9) or (10.10) as thegoverning continuity, momentum, and energy equations, respectively, for quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow. Examine these equations—they are algebraic equations (with the exception of the single integral term in the momentum equation). InFigure 10.7, assume that the inﬂow conditions ρ 1,u1,p1,T1, and h1are given and that the area distribution A=A(x)is presented. Also, assume a calorically perfect gas, where p2=ρ2RT2 (10.11) and h2=cpT2 (10.12) Equations (10.1), (10.5), (10.9) or (10.10), (10.11), and (10.12) constitute ﬁveequations for the ﬁve unknowns ρ 2,u2,p2,T2, and h2. We could, in principle, solve these equations directly for the unknown ﬂow quantities at station 2 inFigure 10.7. However, such a direct solution would involve substantial algebraicmanipulations. Instead, we take a simpler tack, as described in Section 10.3. Before moving on to a solution of the governing equations, let us exam- ine some physical characteristics of a quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow. To help thisexamination, we ﬁrst obtain some differential expressions for the governing equa- tions, in contrast to the algebraic equations obtained above. For example, considerEquation (10.1), which states that ρuA=const (10.13) through a variable-area duct. Differentiating Equation (10.13), we have d(ρuA)=0 (10.14) which is the differential form of the continuity equation for quasi-one-dimensionalﬂow. To obtain a differential form of the momentum equation, apply Equation (10.5) to the inﬁnitesimal control volume sketched in Figure 10.8. The ﬂow going intothe volume at station 1, where the area is A, has properties p,u, andρ. In travers- ing the length dx, where the area changes by dA, the ﬂow properties change by the corresponding amounts dp,dρ, and du. Hence, the ﬂow leaving at station 2 has the properties p+dp,u+du, andρ+dρ, as shown in Figure 10.8. For this case, Equation (10.5) becomes [recognizing that the integral in Equation (10.5)can be replaced by its integrand for the differential volume in Figure 10.8] pA+ρu 2A+pdA=(p+dp)(A+dA)+(ρ+dρ)(u+du)2(A+dA) (10.15) In Equation (10.15), all products of differentials, such as dpdA ,dρ(du)2, are very small and can be ignored. Hence, Equation (10.15) becomes Adp+Au2dρ+ρu2dA+2ρuAdu =0 (10.16)CHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 697 Figure 10.8 Incremental control volume. Expanding the continuity equation, Equation (10.14), and multiplying by u, we have ρu2dA+ρuAdu +Au2dρ=0 (10.17) Subtracting Equation (10.17) from (10.16), we obtain dp=−ρu du (10.18) which is the differential form of the momentum equation for steady, inviscid, quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow. Equation (10.18) is called Euler’s equation.W eh a v e seen it before—as Equation (3.12). In Section 3.2, it was derived from the dif-ferential form of the general momentum equation in three dimensions. (Makecertain to review that derivation before progressing further.) In Section 3.2, wedemonstrated that Equation (3.12) holds along a streamline in a general three-dimensional ﬂow. Now we see Euler’s equation again, in Equation (10.18), whichwas derived from the governing equations for quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow. A differential form of the energy equation follows directly from Equa- tion (10.9), which states that h+u 2 2=const Differentiating this equation, we have dh+u du=0 (10.19) In summary, Equations (10.14), (10.18), and (10.19) are differential forms of the continuity, momentum, and energy equations, respectively, for a steady,inviscid, adiabatic, quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow. We have obtained them from thealgebraic forms of the equations derived earlier, applied essentially to the picture698 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow shown in Figure 10.8. Now you might ask the question, Since we spent some effort obtaining partial differential equations for continuity, momentum, and energy inChapter 2, applicable to a general three-dimensional ﬂow, why would we notsimply set ∂/∂y=0 and ∂/∂z=0 in those equations and obtain differential equations applicable to the one-dimensional ﬂow treated in the present chapter?The answer is that we certainly could perform such a reduction, and we wouldobtain Equations (10.18) and (10.19) directly. [Return to the differential equations,Equations (2.113 a) and (2.114), and prove this to yourself.] However, if we take the general continuity equation, Equation (2.52), and reduce it to one-dimensionalﬂow, we obtain d(ρu)=0. Comparing this result with Equation (10.14) for quasi- one-dimensional ﬂow, we see an inconsistency. This is another example of thephysical inconsistency between the assumption of quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow in a variable-area duct and the three-dimensional ﬂow that actually occurs in sucha duct. The result obtained from Equation (2.52), namely, d(ρu)=0, is a truly one-dimensional result, which applies to constant-area ﬂows such as considered in Chapter 8. [Recall in Chapter 8 that the continuity equation was used in the formρu=constant, which is compatible with Equation (2.52).] However, once we make the quasi-one-dimensional assumption, that is, that uniform properties holdacross a given cross section in a variable-area duct, then Equation (10.14) is theonly differential form of the continuity equation which insures mass conservationfor such an assumed ﬂow. Let us now use the differential forms of the governing equations, obtained above, to study some physical characteristics of quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow. Suchphysical information can be obtained from a particular combination of theseequations, as follows. From Equation (10.14), dρ ρ+du u+dA A=0 (10.20) We wish to obtain an equation that relates the change in velocity duto the change in areadA. Hence, to eliminate dρ/ρin Equation (10.20), consider Equation (10.18) written as dp ρ=dp dρdρ ρ=−u du (10.21) Keep in mind that we are dealing with inviscid, adiabatic ﬂow. Moreover, forthe time being, we are assuming no shock waves in the ﬂow. Hence, the ﬂow isisentropic. In particular, any change in density dρwith respect to a change in pressure dptakes place isentropically; that is, dp dρ≡/parenleftbigg∂p ∂ρ/parenrightbigg s(10.22) From Equation (8.18) for the speed of sound, Equation (10.22) becomes dp dρ=a2(10.23)CHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 699 Substituting Equation (10.23) into (10.21), we have a2dρ ρ=−u du ordρ ρ=−u du a2=−u2 a2du u=− M2du u(10.24) Substituting Equation (10.24) into (10.20), we have −M2du u+du u+dA A=0 ordA A=(M2−1)du u(10.25) Equation (10.25) is the desired equation which relates dAtodu; it is called the area-velocity relation. Equation (10.25) is very important; study it closely. In the process, recall the standard convention for differentials; for example, a positive value of duconnotes anincrease in velocity, a negative value of duconnotes a decrease in velocity, etc. With this in mind, Equation (10.25) tells us the following information: 1.For 0≤M<1 (subsonic ﬂow), the quantity in parentheses in Equation (10.25) is negative. Hence, an increase in velocity (positive du) is associated with a decrease in area (negative dA). Likewise, a decrease in velocity (negative du) is associated with an increase in area (positive dA). Clearly, for a subsonic compressible ﬂow, to increase the velocity, we must have a convergent duct, and to decrease the velocity, we must have adivergent duct. These results are illustrated at the top of Figure 10.9. Also,these results are similar to the familiar trends for incompressible ﬂow M > 1M < 1u increasing u increasingu decreasing u decreasing Figure 10.9 Compressible ﬂow in converging and diverging ducts.700 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow studied in Section 3.3. Once again we see that subsonic compressible ﬂow is qualitatively (but not quantitatively) similar to incompressible ﬂow. 2.ForM>1 (supersonic ﬂow), the quantity in parentheses in Equation (10.25) is positive. Hence, an increase in velocity (positive du) is associated with an increase in area (positive dA). Likewise, a decrease in velocity (negative du) is associated with a decrease in area (negative dA). For a supersonic ﬂow, to increase the velocity, we must have a divergentduct, and to decrease the velocity, we must have a convergent duct. Theseresults are illustrated at the bottom of Figure 10.9; they are the direct opposite of the trends for subsonic ﬂow. 3.ForM=1 (sonic ﬂow), Equation (10.25) shows that dA=0 even though a ﬁnite duexists. Mathematically, this corresponds to a local maximum or minimum in the area distribution. Physically, it corresponds to a minimumarea, as discussed below. Imagine that we want to take a gas at rest and isentropically expand it to supersonic speeds. The above results show that we must ﬁrst accelerate the gas subsonically in a convergent duct. However, as soon as sonic conditions areachieved, we must further expand the gas to supersonic speeds by divergingthe duct. Hence, a nozzle designed to achieve supersonic ﬂow at its exit is aconvergent-divergent duct, as sketched at the top of Figure 10.10. The minimum area of the duct is called the throat. Whenever an isentropic ﬂow expands from Figure 10.10 Illustration and comparison of a supersonic nozzle and a supersonic diffuser.CHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 701 subsonic to supersonic speeds, the ﬂow must pass through a throat; moreover, in such a case, M=1 at the throat. The converse is also true; if we wish to take a supersonic ﬂow and slow it down isentropically to subsonic speeds, we mustﬁrst decelerate the gas in a convergent duct, and then as soon as sonic ﬂow isobtained, we must further decelerate it to subsonic speeds in a divergent duct.Here, the convergent-divergent duct at the bottom of Figure 10.10 is operatingas a diffuser. Note that whenever an isentropic ﬂow is slowed from supersonic tosubsonic speeds, the ﬂow must pass through a throat; moreover, in such a case, M=1 at the throat. As a ﬁnal note on Equation (10.25), consider the case when M=0. Then we have dA/A=− du/u, which integrates to Au=constant. This is the familiar continuity equation for incompressible ﬂow in ducts as derived in Section 3.3 andas given by Equation (3.22). 10.3 NOZZLE FLOWS In this section, we move to the left-hand branch of the road map given in Fig-ure 10.5; that is, we study in detail the compressible ﬂow through nozzles. Toexpedite this study, we ﬁrst derive an important equation which relates Machnumber to the ratio of duct area to sonic throat area. Consider the duct shown in Figure 10.11. Assume that sonic ﬂow exists at the throat, where the area is A ∗. The Mach number and the velocity at the throat are denoted by M∗andu∗, respectively. Since the ﬂow is sonic at the throat, M∗=1 andu∗=a∗. (Note that the use of an asterisk to denote sonic conditions was introduced in Section 7.5; we continue this convention in our present discussion.)At any other section of this duct, the area, the Mach number, and the velocityare denoted by A,M, and u, respectively, as shown in Figure 10.11. Writing Equation (10.1) between AandA ∗, we have ρ∗u∗A∗=ρuA (10.26) Figure 10.11 Geometry for the derivation of the area–Mach number relation.702 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Since u∗=a∗, Equation (10.26) becomes A A∗=ρ∗ ρa∗ u=ρ∗ ρ0ρ0 ρa∗ u(10.27) where ρ0is the stagnation density deﬁned in Section 7.5 and is constant throughout an isentropic ﬂow. From Equation (8.46), we have ρ∗ ρ0=/parenleftbigg2 γ+1/parenrightbigg1/(γ−1) (10.28) Also, from Equation (8.43), we have ρ0 ρ=/parenleftbigg 1+γ−1 2M2/parenrightbigg1/(γ−1) (10.29) Also, recalling the deﬁnition of M∗in Section 8.4, as well as Equation (8.48), we have /parenleftbiggu a∗/parenrightbigg2 =M∗2=[(γ+1)/2] M2 1+[(γ−1)/2] M2(10.30) Squaring Equation (10.27) and substituting Equations (10.28) to (10.30), we obtain /parenleftbiggA A∗/parenrightbigg2 =/parenleftbiggρ∗ ρ0/parenrightbigg2/parenleftbiggρ0 ρ/parenrightbigg2/parenleftbigga∗ u/parenrightbigg2 or /parenleftbiggA A∗/parenrightbigg2 =/parenleftbigg2 γ+1/parenrightbigg2/(γ−1)/parenleftbigg 1+γ−1 2M2/parenrightbigg2/(γ−1)1+[(γ−1)/2] M2 [(γ+1)/2] M2(10.31) Algebraically simplifying Equation (10.31), we have /parenleftbiggA A∗/parenrightbigg2 =1 M2/bracketleftbigg2 γ+1/parenleftbigg 1+γ−1 2M2/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg(γ+1)/(γ −1) (10.32) Equation (10.32) is very important; it is called the area–Mach number relation, and it contains a striking result. “Turned inside out,” Equation (10.32) tells usthat M=f(A/A ∗); that is, the Mach number at any location in the duct is a function of the ratio of the local duct area to the sonic throat area. Recall fromour discussion of Equation (10.25) that Amust be greater than or at least equal to A ∗; the case where A<A∗is physically not possible in an isentropic ﬂow. Thus, in Equation (10.32), A/A∗≥1. Also, Equation (10.32) yields twosolutions for Mat a given A/A∗—a subsonic value and a supersonic value. Which value of M that actually holds in a given case depends on the pressures at the inlet and exitof the duct, as explained later. The results for A/A ∗as a function of M, obtained from Equation (10.32), are tabulated in Appendix A. Examining Appendix A, wenote that for subsonic values of M, asMincreases, A/A ∗decreases (i.e., the duct converges). At M=1,A/A∗=1 in Appendix A. Finally, for supersonic valuesCHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 703 Me = Me6 > 1 = (1 + M2)/H110021Me6pe Mp0 T0 Inlet Te x xExit Calcutated from Eq.

These trends in Appendix A are consistent with our physical discussion of convergent-divergent ducts at the end of Section 10.2. Moreover, Appendix A shows the double-valuednature of Mas a function of A/A ∗. For example, for A/A∗=2, we have either M=0.31 or M=2.2. Consider a given convergent-divergent nozzle, as sketched in Figure 10.12 a. Assume that the area ratio at the inlet Ai/A∗is very large and that the ﬂow at the inlet is fed from a large gas reservoir where the gas is essentially stationary.The reservoir pressure and temperature are p 0andT0, respectively. Since Ai/A∗ is very large, the subsonic Mach number at the inlet is very small, M≈0. Thus, the pressure and temperature at the inlet are essentially p0andT0, respectively. The area distribution of the nozzle A=A(x)is speciﬁed, so that A/A∗is known704 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow at every station along the nozzle. The area of the throat is denoted by At, and the exit area is denoted by Ae. The Mach number and static pressure at the exit are denoted by Meandpe, respectively. Assume that we have an isentropic expansion of the gas through this nozzle to a supersonic Mach number Me=Me,6at the exit (the reason for the subscript 6 will be apparent later). The corresponding exit pressure is pe,6. For this expansion, the ﬂow is sonic at the throat; hence, M=1 andAt=A∗at the throat. The ﬂow properties through the nozzle are a function of the local area ratio A/A∗and are obtained as follows: 1.The local Mach number as a function of xis obtained from Equation (10.32), or more directly from the tabulated values inAppendix A. For the speciﬁed A=A(x), we know the corresponding A/A ∗=f(x). Then read the related subsonic Mach numbers in the convergent portion of the nozzle from the ﬁrst part of Appendix A (for M<1) and the related supersonic Mach numbers in the divergent portion of the nozzle from the second part of Appendix A (for M>1). The Mach number distribution through the complete nozzle is thus obtained and issketched in Figure 10.12b . 2.Once the Mach number distribution is known, then the correspondingvariation of temperature, pressure, and density can be found fromEquations (8.40), (8.42), and (8.43), respectively, or more directly fromAppendix A. The distributions of p/p 0andT/T0are sketched in Figure 10.12c andd, respectively. Examine the variations shown in Figure 10.12. For the isentropic expansion ofa gas through a convergent-divergent nozzle, the Mach number monotonicallyincreases from near 0 at the inlet to M=1 at the throat, and to the supersonic value M e,6at the exit. The pressure monotonically decreases from p0at the inlet to 0.528 p0at the throat and to the lower value pe,6at the exit. Similarly, the temperature monotonically decreases from T0at the inlet to 0.833 T0at the throat and to the lower value Te,6at the exit. Again, for the isentropic ﬂow shown in Figure 10.12, we emphasize that the distribution of M, and hence the resulting distributions of pandT, through the nozzle depends only on the local area ratio A/A∗. This is the key to the analysis of isentropic, supersonic, quasi-one- dimensional nozzle ﬂows. Imagine that you take a convergent-divergent nozzle, and simply place it on a table in front of you. What is going to happen? Is the air going to suddenlystart ﬂowing through the nozzle of its own accord? The answer is, of course not!Rather, by this stage in your study of aerodynamics, your intuition should tell youthat we have to impose a force on the gas in order to produce any acceleration.Indeed, this is the essence of the momentum equation derived in Section 2.5. Forthe inviscid ﬂows considered here, the only mechanism to produce an acceleratingforce on a gas is a pressure gradient. Thus, returning to the nozzle on the table,a pressure difference must be created between the inlet and exit; only then willthe gas start to ﬂow through the nozzle. The exit pressure must be less than theinlet pressure; that is, p e<p0. Moreover, if we wish to produce the isentropicCHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 705 1.0 1.0 00.52803 32 21 1Flow p0 M Me3 Me2 Me1Me (a) (b) (c)pe x x xAt pe1 /H11408p0 pe2 /H11408p0 pe3 /H11408p0p p0 Figure 10.13 Isentropic subsonic nozzle ﬂow. supersonic ﬂow sketched in Figure 10.12, the pressure pe/p0must be precisely the value stipulated by Appendix A for the known exit Mach number Me,6; that is,pe/p0=pe,6/p0. If the pressure ratio is different from the above isentropic value, the ﬂow either inside or outside the nozzle will be different from that shown in Figure 10.12. Let us examine the type of nozzle ﬂows that occur when pe/p0is not equal to the precise isentropic value for Me,6, that is, when pe/p0/negationslash=pe,6/p0. To begin with, consider the convergent-divergent nozzle sketched in Figure 10.13 a. If pe=p0, no pressure difference exists, and no ﬂow occurs inside the nozzle. Now assume that peis minutely reduced below p0, say, pe=0.999 p0. This small pressure difference will produce a very low-speed subsonic ﬂow inside thenozzle—essentially a gentle wind. The local Mach number will increase slightlythrough the convergent portion, reaching a maximum value at the throat, as shown706 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow by curve 1 in Figure 10.13b . This Mach number at the throat will notbe sonic; rather, it will be some small subsonic value. Downstream of the throat, the local Mach number will decrease in the divergent section, reaching a very small butﬁnite value M e,1at the exit. Correspondingly, the pressure in the convergent section will gradually decrease from p0at the inlet to a minimum value at the throat, and then will gradually increase to the value pe,1at the exit. This variation is shown as curve 1 in Figure 10.13c . Please note that because the ﬂow is not sonic at the throat in this case, Atis not equal to A∗. Recall that A∗, which appears in Equation (10.32), is the sonic throat area. In the case of purely subsonic ﬂow through a convergent-divergent nozzle, A∗takes on the character of a reference area; it is not the same as the actual geometric area of the nozzle throat At. Rather, A∗is the area the ﬂow in Figure 10.13 would have ifit were somehow accelerated to sonic velocity. If this did happen, the ﬂow area would have to be decreasedfurther than shown in Figure 10.13 a. Hence, for a purely subsonic ﬂow A t>A∗. Assume that we further decrease the exit pressure in Figure 10.13, say, to the value pe=pe,2. The ﬂow is now illustrated by the curves labeled 2 in Figure 10.13. The ﬂow moves faster through the nozzle, and the maximum Mach number atthe throat increases but remains less than 1. Now, let us reduce p eto the value pe=pe,3, such that the ﬂow just reaches sonic conditions at the throat. This is shown by curve 3 in Figure 10.13. The throat Mach number is 1, and the throatpressure is 0.528 p The ﬂow downstream of the throat is subsonic. Upon comparing Figures 10.12 and 10.13, we are struck by an important physical difference. For a given nozzle shape, there is only oneallowable isen- tropic ﬂow solution for the supersonic case shown in Figure 10.12. In contrast,there are an inﬁnite number of possible isentropic subsonic solutions, each one corresponding to some value of p e, where p0≥pe≥pe,3. Only three solutions of this inﬁnite set of solutions are sketched in Figure 10.13. Hence, the key factorsfor the analysis of purely subsonic ﬂow in a convergent-divergent nozzle are both A/A ∗andpe/p0. Consider the mass ﬂow through the convergent-divergent nozzle in Fig- ure 10.13. As the exit pressure is decreased, the ﬂow velocity in the throat in-creases; hence, the mass ﬂow increases. The mass ﬂow can be calculated byevaluating Equation (10.1) at the throat; that is, ˙m=ρ tutAt. As pedecreases, ut increases and ρtdecreases. However, the percentage increase in utis much greater than the decrease in ρt. As a result, ˙mincreases, as sketched in Figure 10.14. When pe=pe,3, sonic ﬂow is achieved at the throat, and ˙m=ρ∗u∗A∗=ρ∗u∗At. Now, ifpeis further reduced below pe,3, the conditions at the throat take on a new behavior; they remain unchanged. From our discussion in Section 10.2, the Mach number at the throat cannot exceed 1; hence, as peis further reduced, Mwill remain equal to 1 at the throat. Consequently, the mass ﬂow will remain constantasp eis reduced below pe,3, as shown in Figure 10.14. In a sense, the ﬂow at the throat, as well as upstream of the throat, becomes “frozen.” Once the ﬂowbecomes sonic at the throat, disturbances cannot work their way upstream of thethroat. Hence, the ﬂow in the convergent section of the nozzle no longer commu-nicates with the exit pressure and has no way of knowing that the exit pressureCHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 707 Figure 10.14 Variation of mass ﬂow with exit pressure; illustration of choked ﬂow. is continuing to decrease. This situation—when the ﬂow goes sonic at the throat, and the mass ﬂow remains constant no matter how low peis reduced—is called choked ﬂow. It is a vital aspect of the compressible ﬂow through ducts, and weconsider it further in our subsequent discussions. Return to the subsonic nozzle ﬂows sketched in Figure 10.13. Question: What happens in the duct when p eis reduced below pe,3? In the convergent portion, as described above, nothing happens. The ﬂow properties remain ﬁxedat the conditions shown by curve 3 in the convergent section of the duct (the leftside of Figure 10.13b andc). However, a lot happens in the divergent section of the duct. As the exit pressure is reduced below p e,3, a region of supersonic ﬂow appears downstream of the throat. However, the exit pressure is too high to allowan isentropic supersonic ﬂow throughout the entire divergent section. Instead, for p eless than pe,3but substantially higher than the fully isentropic value pe,6(see Figure 10.12c ), a normal shock wave is formed downstream of the throat. This situation is sketched in Figure 10.15. In Figure 10.15, the exit pressure has been reduced to pe,4, where pe,4< pe,3, but where pe,4is also substantially higher than pe,6. Here we observe a normal shock wave standing inside the nozzle at a distance ddownstream of the throat. Between the throat and the normal shock wave, the ﬂow is given bythe supersonic isentropic solution, as shown in Figure 10.15b andc. Behind the shock wave, the ﬂow is subsonic. This subsonic ﬂow sees the divergent duct andisentropically slows down further as it moves to the exit. Correspondingly, thepressure experiences a discontinuous increase across the shock wave and thenis further increased as the ﬂow slows down toward the exit. The ﬂow on boththe left and right sides of the shock wave is isentropic; however, the entropyincreases across the shock wave. Hence, the ﬂow on the left side of the shockwave is isentropic with one value of entropy s 1, and the ﬂow on the right side of the shock wave is isentropic with another value of entropy s2, where s2>s1. The location of the shock wave inside the nozzle, given by din Figure 10.15 a, is determined by the requirement that the increase in static pressure across the waveplus that in the divergent portion of the subsonic ﬂow behind the shock be just708 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Normal shock wave Flow Supersonic isentropic solution Supersonicisentropic solution1.0 0 1.0 0.528 0Md Me4 pe4 pe6x x x(a) (b) (c)p p0 Figure 10.15 Supersonic nozzle ﬂow with a normal shock inside the nozzle. right to achieve pe,4at the exit. As peis further reduced, the normal shock wave moves downstream, closer to the nozzle exit. At a certain value of exit pressure, pe=pe,5, the normal shock stands precisely at the exit. This is sketched in Figure 10.16 atoc. At this stage, when pe=pe,5, the ﬂow through the entire nozzle, except precisely at the exit, is isentropic. To this stage in our discussion, we have dealt with pe, which is the pres- sure right at the nozzle exit. In Figures 10.12, 10.13, 10.15, and 10.16 atoc, we have not been concerned with the ﬂow downstream of the nozzle exit. Now imagine that the nozzle in Figure 10.16 aexhausts directly into a region of sur- rounding gas downstream of the exit. These surroundings could be, for example,the atmosphere. In any case, the pressure of the surroundings downstream of theexit is deﬁned as the back pressure, denoted by p B. When the ﬂow at the nozzle exit is subsonic, the exit pressure must equal the back pressure, pe=pB, because a pressure discontinuity cannot be maintained in a steady subsonic ﬂow. That is,when the exit ﬂow is subsonic, the surrounding back pressure is impressed on theexit ﬂow. Hence, in Figure 10.13, p B=pe,1for curve 1, pB=pe,2for curve 2, andpB=pe,3for curve 3. For the same reason, pB=pe,4in Figure 10.15, and pB=pe,5in Figure 10.16. Hence, in discussing these ﬁgures, instead of statingCHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 709 Me5 pe5Me6 M 1.0 0 1.0 0(b) (c)(e)(a)FlowNormal shock (d) (f)x xMe6 Me5pe6pe6 pe6 pe6pB = pe6 pB < pe6pe6 < pB < pe5 pe5 /p0 pe6 /p0p0p Figure 10.16 Supersonic nozzle ﬂows with waves at the nozzle exit: (a), (b), and (c) pertain to a normal shock at the exit, (d ) overexpanded nozzle, (e) isentropic expansion to the back pressure equal to the exit pressure, ( f) underexpanded nozzle. that we reduced the exit pressure peand observed the consequences, we could just as well have stated that we reduced the back pressure pB. It would have amounted to the same thing. For the remainder of our discussion in this section, let us now imagine that we have control over pBand that we are going to continue to decrease pB. Consider the case when the back pressure is reduced below pe,5. When pe,6<pB<pe,5, the back pressure is still above the isentropic pressure at the nozzle exit. Hence, in ﬂowing out to the surroundings, the jet of gas from the nozzle must somehow becompressed such that its pressure is compatible with p B. This compression takes place across oblique shock waves attached to the exit, as shown in Figure 10.16d . When pBis reduced to the value such that pB=pe,6, there is no mismatch of the exit pressure and the back pressure; the nozzle jet exhausts smoothly into thesurroundings without passing through any waves. This is shown in Figure 10.16e . Finally, as p Bis reduced below pe,6, the jet of gas from the nozzle must expand further in order to match the lower back pressure. This expansion takes placeacross centered expansion waves attached to the exit, as shown in Figure 10.16 f.710 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow When the situation in Figure 10.16d exists, the nozzle is said to be overex- panded, because the pressure at the exit has expanded below the back pressure, pe,6<pB. That is, the nozzle expansion has gone too far, and the jet must pass through oblique shocks in order to come back up to the higher back pressure. Conversely, when the situation in Figure 10.16 fexists, the nozzle is said to beunderexpanded, because the exit pressure is higher than the back pressure, pe,6>pB, and hence the ﬂow is capable of additional expansion after leaving the nozzle. Surveying Figures 10.12 through 10.16, note that the purely isentropic su- personic ﬂow originally illustrated in Figure 10.12 exists throughout the nozzlefor all cases when p B≤pe,5. For example, in Figure 10.16 a, the isentropic su- personic ﬂow solution holds throughout the nozzle except right at the exit, wherea normal shock exists. In Figure 10.16d tof, the ﬂow through the entire nozzle, including at the exit plane, is given by the isentropic supersonic ﬂow solution. Keep in mind that our entire discussion of nozzle ﬂows in this section is pred- icated on having a duct of given shape. We assume that A=A(x)is prescribed. When this is the case, the quasi-one-dimensional theory of this chapter gives areasonable prediction of the ﬂow inside the duct, where the results are interpretedas mean properties averaged over each cross section. This theory does nottell us how to design the contour of the nozzle. In reality, if the walls of the nozzle are not curved just right, then oblique shocks occur inside the nozzle. To obtainthe proper contour for a supersonic nozzle so that it produces isentropic shock-free ﬂow inside the nozzle, we must account for the three-dimensionality of theactual ﬂow. This is one purpose of the method of characteristics, a technique foranalyzing two- and three-dimensional supersonic ﬂow. A brief introduction to themethod of characteristics is given in Chapter 13.

Hence, pe=0.94 atm corresponds to pe,3in Figure 10.13. In the712 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow present problem, pe=0.973 atm, which is higher than pe,3. Hence, in this case, the ﬂow is subsonic throughout the nozzle, including at the throat. For this case, A∗takes on a reference value, and the actual geometric throat area is denoted by At.

This derivation is carried out in great detail inChapter 2 of Reference 21, and in a simpler form in Chapter 9 of Reference 2 wherethe result is also specialized to a rocket engine. You are encouraged to examine thesederivations—they are an excellent example of the use of the control volume concept. Theresulting thrust equation for a rocket engine (see Section 9.8 of Reference 2) is T=˙mu e+(pe−p∞)Ae (E10.1) where Tis the thrust, ˙mis the mass ﬂow through the engine, ueis the gas velocity at the nozzle exit, peis the gas pressure at the nozzle exit, p∞is the surrounding ambient atmospheric pressure, and Aeis the area of the exit. Consider a rocket engine similar to that shown in Figure 10.1. Liquid hydrogen and oxygen are burned in the combustion chamber producing a combustion gas pressure andtemperature of 30 atm and 3500 K, respectively. The area of the rocket nozzle throat is0.4 m The area of the exit is designed so that the exit pressure exactly equals the ambient atmospheric pressure at a standard altitude of 20 km.

The result obtained here, using Equation (E10.3), should be considered moreaccurate. 10.3.1 More on Mass Flow Equation (E10.3) in Example 10.5 has a distinct advantage over the piecemeal calculations of ˙min Example 10.4. Not only does it lead to a straightforward an- swer in one step, it also shows us exactly on what variables the mass ﬂow depends,716 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow and in what manner. From Equation (E10.3), we see that the mass ﬂow depends primarily on p0,T0, and A∗, and that it varies directly with reservoir pressure and the area of the throat, and inversely as the square root of the reservoir temperature.If you double the reservoir pressure, you double the mass ﬂow. If you double thethroat area, you double the mass ﬂow. If you quadruple the reservoir temperature,you cut the mass ﬂow by a half. These variations are fundamental to the physicsof choked ﬂow in a nozzle. Make certain to ﬁx in your mind this proportionality: ˙m∝p 0A∗ √T0(10.33) How is this discussion related to the variation of mass ﬂow sketched in Fig- ure 10.14? Recall that Figure 10.14 pertains to a nozzle ﬂow with ﬁxed reservoirconditions, including a ﬁxed value of p The mass ﬂow is plotted versus exit pressure. If the exit pressure equals p0, there is no pressure difference across the nozzle, hence no ﬂow through the nozzle (i.e., in Figure 10.14 the point for pe=p0corresponds to ˙m=0). As the exit pressure decreases, ˙mﬁrst increases, and then reaches a plateau when pe≤pe,3. For pe,3≤pe≤p0, the nozzle ﬂow is notchoked, and the value of the mass ﬂow depends not only on p0,A∗, andT0, but also on pe. When pefalls below pe,3, the ﬂow is choked, and the mass ﬂow becomes constant no matter how low peis decreased. The horizontal portion of the curve in Figure 10.14 pertains to choked ﬂow, and the magnitudeof this choked mass ﬂow depends only on the values of p 0,A∗, and T0andnot onpe. For the case shown in Figure 10.14, the values of p0,A∗, and T0are ﬁxed, speciﬁc values. If, for whatever reason, the value of p0, orA∗, orT0is changed, then the horizontal choked-ﬂow line in Figure 10.14 would be raised or loweredappropriately, governed by the proportionality given by Equation (10.33). 10.4 DIFFUSERS The role of a diffuser was ﬁrst introduced in Section 3.3 in the context of a low-speed subsonic wind tunnel. There, a diffuser was a divergent duct downstream ofthe test section whose role was to slow the higher-velocity air from the test sectiondown to a very low velocity at the diffuser exit (see Figure 3.8). Indeed, in general,we can deﬁne a diffuser as any duct designed to slow an incoming gas ﬂow tolower velocity at the exit of the diffuser. The incoming ﬂow can be subsonic,as discussed in Figure 3.8, or it can be supersonic, as discussed in the presentsection. However, the shape of the diffuser is drastically different, depending onwhether the incoming ﬂow is subsonic or supersonic. Before pursuing this matter further, let us elaborate on the concept of total pressure p 0as discussed in Section 7.5. In a semiqualitative sense, the total pressure of a ﬂowing gas is a measure of the capacity of the ﬂow to performuseful work. Let us consider two examples: 1.A pressure vessel containing stagnant air at 10 atm 2.A supersonic ﬂow at M=2.16 and p=1 atmCHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 717 In case 1, the air velocity is zero; hence, p0=p=10 atm. Now, imagine that we want to use air to drive a piston in a piston-cylinder arrangement, where useful work is performed by the piston being displaced through a distance. The air isducted into the cylinder from a large manifold, in the same vein as the reciprocatinginternal combustion engine in our automobile. In case 1, the pressure vessel can actas the manifold; hence, the pressure on the piston is 10 atm, and a certain amountof useful work is performed, say, W However, in case 2, the supersonic ﬂow must be slowed to a low velocity before we can readily feed it into the manifold. If thisslowing process can be achieved without loss of total pressure, then the pressurein the manifold in this case is also 10 atm (assuming V≈0), and the same amount of useful work W 1is performed. On the other hand, assume that in slowing down the supersonic stream, a loss of 3 atm takes place in the total pressure. Then thepressure in the manifold is only 7 atm, with the consequent generation of usefulwork W 2, which is less than in the ﬁrst case; that is, W2<W1. The purpose of this simple example is to indicate that the total pressure of a ﬂowing gas is indeeda measure of its capability to perform useful work. On this basis, a loss of totalpressure is always an inefﬁciency—a loss of the capability to do a certain amountof useful work. In light of the above, let us expand our deﬁnition of a diffuser. A diffuser is a duct designed to slow an incoming gas ﬂow to lower velocity at the exit of thediffuser with as small a loss in total pressure as possible. Consequently, an ideal diffuser would be characterized by an isentropic compression to lower velocities; this is sketched in Figure 10.17 a, where a supersonic ﬂow enters the diffuser at M 1, p02 = p01 s2 = s1p01 s1M = 1 M ≈ 1 M < 1(a) Ideal (isentropic) supersonic diffuser (b) Actual supersonic diffuserWeak normal shockA* M1 > 1 p01 s1M1 > 1M2 < 1 At p02 < p01 s2 > s1M2 < 1 Figure 10.17 The ideal (isentropic) diffuser compared with the actual situation.718 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow is isentropically compressed in a convergent duct to Mach 1 at the throat, where the area is A∗, and then is further isentropically compressed in a divergent duct to a low subsonic Mach number at the exit. Because the ﬂow is isentropic, s2=s1, and from Equation (8.73), p0,2=p0,1. Indeed, p0is constant throughout the entire diffuser—a characteristic of isentropic ﬂow. However, common sense should tellyou that the ideal diffuser in Figure 10.17 acan never be achieved. It is extremely difﬁcult to slow a supersonic ﬂow without generating shock waves in the process.For example, examine the convergent portion of the diffuser in Figure 10.17 a. Note that the supersonic ﬂow is turned into itself; hence, the converging ﬂow willinherently generate oblique shock waves, which will destroy the isentropic natureof the ﬂow. Moreover, in real life, the ﬂow is viscous; there will be an entropyincrease within the boundary layers on the walls of the diffuser. For these reasons,an ideal isentropic diffuser can never be constructed; an ideal diffuser is of thenature of a “perpetual motion machine”—only a utopian wish in the minds ofengineers. An actual supersonic diffuser is sketched in Figure 10.17b . Here, the incoming ﬂow is slowed by a series of reﬂected oblique shocks, ﬁrst in a convergent sectionusually consisting of straight walls, and then in a constant-area throat. Due to theinteraction of the shock waves with the viscous ﬂow near the wall, the reﬂectedshock pattern eventually weakens and becomes quite diffuse, sometimes endingin a weak normal shock wave at the end of the constant-area throat. Finally, thesubsonic ﬂow downstream of the constant-area throat is further slowed by movingthrough a divergent section. At the exit, clearly s 2>s1; hence p0,2<p0,1. The art of diffuser design is to obtain as small a total pressure loss as possible, thatis, to design the convergent, divergent, and constant-area throat sections so that p 0,2/p0,1is as close to unity as possible. Unfortunately, in most cases, we fall far short of that goal. For more details on supersonic diffusers, see Chapter 5 ofReference 21 and Chapter 12 of Reference 1. Please note that due to the entropy increase across the shock waves and in the boundary layers, the real diffuser throat area A tis larger than A∗, that is, in Figure 10.17, At>A∗. 10.5 SUPERSONIC WIND TUNNELS Return to the road map given in Figure 10.5. The material for the left and rightbranches is covered in Sections 10.3 and 10.4, respectively. In turn, a mating ofthese two branches gives birth to the fundamental aspects of supersonic windtunnels, to be discussed in this section. Imagine that you want to create a Mach 2.5 uniform ﬂow in a laboratory for the purpose of testing a model of a supersonic vehicle, say, a cone. How do you do it?Clearly, we need a convergent-divergent nozzle with an area ratio A e/A∗=2.637 (see Appendix A). Moreover, we need to establish a pressure ratio, p0/pe= 17.09, across the nozzle in order to obtain a shock-free expansion to Me=2.5 at the exit. Your ﬁrst thought might be to exhaust the nozzle directly into thelaboratory, as sketched in Figure 10.18. Here, the Mach 2.5 ﬂow passes into theCHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 719 A* A*p0 = 17.09 atmMe = 2.5 pe = 1 atmpB = 1 atm Test model AeAe = 2.637 Figure 10.18 Nozzle exhausting directly to the atmosphere. p0 = 2.4 atmMe = 2.5 pe = 0.14 atmpB = 1 atm p2 = pB = 1 atmNozzle exit Normal shock Constant area section Figure 10.19 Nozzle exhausting into a constant-area duct, where a normal shock stands at the exit of the duct. surroundings as a “free jet.” The test model is placed in the ﬂow downstream of the nozzle exit. In order to make certain that the free jet does not have shock orexpansion waves, the nozzle exit pressure p emust equal the back pressure pB, as originally sketched in Figure 10.16e . Since the back pressure is simply that of the atmosphere surrounding the free jet, pB=pe=1 atm. Consequently, to establish the proper isentropic expansion through the nozzle, you need a high-pressure reservoir with p 0=17.09 atm at the inlet to the nozzle. In this manner, you would be able to accomplish your objective, namely, to produce a uniformstream of air at Mach 2.5 in order to test a supersonic model, as sketched inFigure 10.18. In the above example, you may have a problem obtaining the high-pressure air supply at 17.09 atm. You need an air compressor or a bank of high-pressureair bottles—both of which can be expensive. It requires work, hence money, tocreate reservoirs of high-pressure air—the higher the pressure, the more the cost.So, can you accomplish your objective in a more efﬁcient way, at less cost? Theanswer is yes, as follows. Instead of the free jet as sketched in Figure 10.18,imagine that you have a long constant-area section downstream of the nozzleexit, with a normal shock wave standing at the end of the constant-area section;this is shown in Figure 10.19. The pressure downstream of the normal shock wave720 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow isp2=pB=1 atm. At M=2.5, the static pressure ratio across the normal shock is p2/pe=7.125. Hence, the pressure upstream of the normal shock is 0.14 atm. Since the ﬂow is uniform in the constant-area section, this pressure is also equal to the nozzle exit pressure; that is, pe=0.14 atm. Thus, in order to obtain the proper isentropic ﬂow through the nozzle, which requires a pressureratio of p 0/pe=17.09, we need a reservoir with a pressure of only 2.4 atm. This is considerably more efﬁcient than the 17.09 atm required in Figure 10.18.Hence, we have created a uniform Mach 2.5 ﬂow (in the constant-area duct) at aconsiderable reduction in cost compared with the scheme in Figure 10.18. In Figure 10.19, the normal shock wave is acting as a diffuser, slowing the air originally at Mach 2.5 to the subsonic value of Mach 0.513 immediately behindthe shock. Hence, by the addition of this “diffuser,” we can more efﬁcientlyproduce our uniform Mach 2.5 ﬂow. This illustrates one of the functions of adiffuser. However, the “normal shock diffuser” sketched in Figure 10.19 hasseveral problems: 1.A normal shock is the strongest possible shock, hence creating the largest total pressure loss. If we could replace the normal shock in Figure 10.19with a weaker shock, the total pressure loss would be less, and the requiredreservoir pressure p 0would be less than 2.4 atm. 2.It is extremely difﬁcult to hold a normal shock wave stationary at the ductexit; in real life, ﬂow unsteadiness and instabilities would cause the shockto move somewhere else and to ﬂuctuate constantly in position. Thus, wecould never be certain about the quality of the ﬂow in the constant-area duct. 3.As soon as a test model is introduced into the constant-area section, theoblique waves from the model would propagate downstream, causing theﬂow to become two- or three-dimensional. The normal shock sketched inFigure 10.19 could not exist in such a ﬂow. Hence, let us replace the normal shock in Figure 10.19 with the oblique shock diffuser shown in Figure 10.17b . The resulting duct would appear as sketched in Figure 10.20. Examine this ﬁgure closely. We have a convergent-divergent nozzle feeding a uniform supersonic ﬂow into the constant-area duct, which Me pep0 At1 = A* (Nozzle throat) (First throat)At2 (Diffuser throat)(Second throat)M << 1 pBTestmodelDiffuser Test section Nozzle 12 Figure 10.20 Sketch of a supersonic wind tunnel.CHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 721 is called the test section. This ﬂow is subsequently slowed to a low subsonic speed by means of a diffuser. This arrangement—namely, a convergent-divergent nozzle, a test section, and a convergent-divergent diffuser—is a supersonic wind tunnel. A test model, the cone in Figure 10.20, is placed in the test section,where aerodynamic measurements such as lift, drag, and pressure distribution aremade. The wave system from the model propagates downstream and interactswith the multireﬂected shocks in the diffuser. The pressure ratio required to runthe supersonic tunnel is p 0/pB. This can be obtained by making p0large via a high-pressure reservoir at the inlet to the nozzle or by making pBsmall via a vacuum source at the exit of the diffuser, or a combination of both. The main source of total pressure loss in a supersonic wind tunnel is the diffuser. How does the oblique shock diffuser in Figure 10.20 compare with thehypothetical normal shock diffuser in Figure 10.19? Is the total pressure lossacross all the reﬂected oblique shocks in Figure 10.20 greater or less than acrossthe single normal shock wave in Figure 10.19? This is an important question,since the smaller the total pressure loss in the diffuser, the smaller is the pressureratio p 0/pBrequired to run the supersonic tunnel. There is no pat answer to this question. However, it is usually true that progressively reducing the velocity of asupersonic ﬂow through a series of oblique shocks to a low supersonic value, andthen further reducing the ﬂow to subsonic speeds across a weak normal shock,results in a smaller total pressure loss than simply reducing the ﬂow to subsonic speeds across a single, strong normal shock wave at the initially high supersonicMach number. This trend is illustrated by Example 9.5. Therefore, the obliqueshock diffuser shown in Figures 10.17b and 10.20 is usually more efﬁcient than the simple normal shock diffuser shown in Figure 10.19. This is not always true,however, because in an actual real-life oblique shock diffuser, the shock wavesinteract with the boundary layers on the walls, causing local thickening and evenpossible separation of the boundary layers. This creates an additional total pressureloss. Moreover, the simple aspect of skin friction exerted on the surface generatesa total pressure loss. Hence, actual oblique shock diffusers may have efﬁcienciesgreater or less than a hypothetical normal shock diffuser. Nevertheless, virtuallyall supersonic wind tunnels use oblique shock diffusers qualitatively similar tothat shown in Figure 10.20. Notice that the supersonic wind tunnel shown in Figure 10.20 has two throats: the nozzle throat with area A t,1is called the ﬁrst throat, and the diffuser throat with area At,2is called the second throat. The mass ﬂow through the nozzle can be expressed as ˙m=ρuAevaluated at the ﬁrst throat. This station is denoted as station 1 in Figure 10.20, and hence the mass ﬂow through the nozzle is ˙m1=ρ1u1At,1=ρ∗ 1a∗ 1At,1. In turn, the mass ﬂow through the diffuser can be expressed as ˙m=ρuAevaluated at station 2, namely, ˙m2=ρ2u2At,2. For steady ﬂow through the wind tunnel, ˙m1=˙m2. Hence, ρ∗ 1a∗ 1At,1=ρ2u2At,2 (10.34) Since the thermodynamic state of the gas is irreversibly changed in going throughthe shock waves created by the test model and generated in the diffuser, clearly722 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow ρ2and possibly u2are different from ρ∗ 1anda∗ 1, respectively. Hence, from Equa- tion (10.34), the second throat must have a different area from the ﬁrst throat; that is, At,2/negationslash=At,1. Question: How does At,2differ from At,1? Let us assume that sonic ﬂow occurs at both stations 1 and 2 in Figure 10.20. Thus, Equation (10.34) can be written as At,2 At,1=ρ∗ 1a∗ 1 ρ∗ 2a∗ 2(10.35) Recall from Section 8.4 that a∗is constant for an adiabatic ﬂow. Also, recall that the ﬂow across shock waves is adiabatic (but not isentropic). Hence, the ﬂow throughout the wind tunnel sketched in Figure 10.18 is adiabatic, and therefore a∗ 1=a∗ In turn, Equation (10.35) becomes At,2 At,1=ρ∗ 1 ρ∗ 2(10.36) Recall from Section 8.4 that T∗is also constant throughout the adiabatic ﬂow of a calorically perfect gas. Hence, from the equation of state, ρ∗ 1 ρ∗ 2=p∗ 1/RT∗ 1 p∗ 2/RT∗ 2=p∗ 1 p∗ 2(10.37) Substituting Equation (10.37) into (10.36), we have At,2 At,1=p∗ 1 p∗ 2(10.38) From Equation (8.45), we have p∗ 1=p0,1/parenleftbigg2 γ+1/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) and p∗ 2=p0,2/parenleftbigg2 γ+1/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) Substituting the above into Equation (10.38), we obtain At,2 At,1=p0,1 p0,2(10.39) Examining Figure 10.20, the total pressure always decreases across shock waves;therefore, p 0,2<p0,1. In turn, from Equation (10.39), At,2>At,1. Thus, the second throat must always be larger than the ﬁrst throat. Only in the case of an ideal isentropic diffuser, where p0=constant, would At,2=At,1, and we have already discussed the impossibility of such an ideal diffuser.CHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 723 Equation (10.39) is a useful relation to size the second throat relative to the ﬁrst throat ifwe know the total pressure ratio across the tunnel. In the absence of such information, for the preliminary design of supersonic wind tunnels, the total pressure ratio across a normal shock is assumed. For a given wind tunnel, if At,2is less than the value given by Equation (10.39), the diffuser will “choke”; that is, the diffuser cannot pass the mass ﬂow comingfrom the isentropic, supersonic expansion through the nozzle. In this case, natureadjusts the ﬂow through the wind tunnel by creating shock waves in the nozzle,which in turn reduce the Mach number in the test section, producing weakershocks in the diffuser with an attendant overall reduction in the total pressureloss; that is, nature adjusts the total pressure loss such that p 0,1/p0,2=p0,1/pB satisﬁes Equation (10.39). Sometimes this adjustment is so severe that a nor-mal shock stands inside the nozzle, and the ﬂow through the test section anddiffuser is totally subsonic. Obviously, this choked situation is not desirable be-cause we no longer have uniform ﬂow at the desired Mach number in the testsection. In such a case, the supersonic wind tunnel is said to be unstarted. The only way to rectify this situation is to make A t,2/At,1large enough so that the diffuser can pass the mass ﬂow from the isentropic expansion in the nozzle, thatis, so that Equation (10.39) is satisﬁed along with a shock-free isentropic nozzleexpansion. As a general concluding comment, the basic concepts and relations discussed in this chapter are not limited to nozzles, diffusers, and supersonic wind tunnels.Rather, we have been discussing quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow, which can be ap-plied in many applications involving ﬂow in a duct. For example, inlets on jetengines, which diffuse the ﬂow to lower speeds before entering the engine com-pressor, obey the same principles. Also, a rocket engine is basically a supersonicnozzle designed to optimize the thrust from the expanded jet. The applicationsof the ideas presented in this chapter are numerous, and you should make certainthat you understand these ideas before progressing further. In Section 1.2, we subdivided aerodynamics into external and internal ﬂows. You are reminded that the material in this chapter deals exclusively with internalﬂows.

Here we see the case where the pressure ratio, pe,4/p0is such that a normal shock wave stands inside the nozzle. This is a classic inviscid ﬂow picture. In reality, there is a boundary layer growing along the nozzle wall,and the shock wave interacts with this boundary layer. One of the possible ﬂowﬁelds resulting from this interaction is sketched in Figure 10.21. The adversepressure gradient across the shock causes the boundary layer to separate fromthe nozzle wall. A lambda-type shock pattern occurs at the two feet of the shocknear the wall, and the core of the nozzle ﬂow, now separated from the wall, ﬂowsdownstream at almost constant area. A series of schlieren photographs showing this type of ﬂow is given in Fig- ure 10.22, obtained from the recent work of Hunter (Craig A. Hunter, “Exper-imental Investigation of Separated Nozzle Flows,” Journal of Propulsion and Power, vol. 20, no. 3, May–June 2004, pp. 527–532). For the nozzle shown in Figure 10.22, the exit-to-throat area ratio, A e/At, is 1.797. In Figure 10.22 a, the pressure ratio pe,4/p0=0.5; the normal shock stands inside the nozzle, and the lambda structure at both ends of the shock is clearly seen. The separated ﬂowis seen trailing downstream from the lambda shock pattern. In Figures 10.22b , c, and dthe shock pattern progressively moves closer to the nozzle exit as the pressure ratio is progressively reduced to 0.417, 0.333, and 0.294, respectively.A detailed schematic of the shock pattern for the pressure ratio of 0.417 is shownin Figure 10.23, corresponding to the ﬂow in Figure 10.22b . These results are an example of how the realities of a viscous ﬂow can change the ideal picture obtained for an inviscid ﬂow. The recent paper by Craig Hunter,referenced earlier, is an excellent discussion of the real ﬂow in a supersonic nozzleunder conditions where shock waves occur inside the nozzle. You are encouragedto study this reference for a revealing discussion of this interesting phenomena. Figure 10.21 Sketch of an overexpanded nozzle ﬂow with ﬂow separation.

Thus, we can visualize the quasi-one-dimensional results as giving the meanproperties at a given station, averaged over the cross section. The quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow assumption gives reasonable results for many internal ﬂowproblems; it is a “workhorse” in the everyday application of compressible ﬂow.The governing equations for this are Continuity: ρ 1u1A1=ρ2u2A2 (10.1) Momentum: p1A1+ρ1u2 1A1+/integraldisplayA2 A1pdA=p2A2+ρ2u22A2 (10.5) Energy: h1+u2 1 2=h2+u22 2(10.9) The area velocity relation dA A=(M2−1)du u(10.25) tells us that 1.To accelerate (decelerate) a subsonic ﬂow, the area must decrease (increase). 2.To accelerate (decelerate) a supersonic ﬂow, the area must increase(decrease). 3.Sonic ﬂow can only occur at a throat or minimum area of the ﬂow. The isentropic ﬂow of a calorically perfect gas through a nozzle is governedby the relation /parenleftbiggA A∗/parenrightbigg2 =1 M2/bracketleftbigg2 γ+1/parenleftbigg 1+γ−1 2M2/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg(γ+1)/(γ −1) (10.32) This tells us that the Mach number in a duct is governed by the ratio of localduct area to the sonic throat area; moreover, for a given area ratio, there aretwo values of Mach number that satisfy Equation (10.32)—a subsonic valueand a supersonic value.CHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 727 For a given convergent-divergent duct, there is only one possible isentropic ﬂow solution for supersonic ﬂow; in contrast, there are an inﬁnite number ofsubsonic isentropic solutions, each one associated with a different pressureratio across the nozzle, p 0/pe=p0/pB. In a supersonic wind tunnel, the ratio of second throat area to ﬁrst throat areashould be approximately A t,2 At,1=p0,1 p0,2(10.39) IfAt,2is reduced much below this value, the diffuser will choke and the tunnel will unstart. 10.8 INTEGRATED WORK CHALLENGE: CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF A SUPERSONIC WIND TUNNEL Concept: A basic sketch of a supersonic wind tunnel is given in Figure 10.20 that illustrates the essential components: nozzle, test section, and diffuser. The pressure ratio p0/pBfrom the inlet to the nozzle to the exit of the diffuser is what makes the tunnel run. Not shown in Figure 10.20 is how this pressure ratio isgenerated. The answer to this question is an essential ﬁrst step in the conceptualdesign of a supersonic wind tunnel. Four different supersonic wind tunnel conﬁgurations for producing the proper pressure ratio across the supersonic nozzle are sketched in Figure 10.24. (a) Blowdown Tunnel (Figure 10.24 a):High-pressure air at pressure p 0is stored in a tank at the entrance to the tunnel. The exit of the tunnel is open tothe surrounding atmosphere, where the back pressure p Bis the atmospheric pressure. The pressure ratio across the tunnel is p0/pB. Flow is started when a pressure valve at point Ais opened. As the air ﬂows out of the storage tank and through the tunnel, the remaining air in the tank expands to ﬁll the tank.During this expansion, both the total pressure p 0and total temperature T0of the remaining air in the tank decrease. These decreases in p0andT0with time are a disadvantage of the blowdown tunnel, but they can be minimizedat the start by having a large enough storage tank such that the mass ﬂowthrough the tunnel is a small percentage of the mass of air stored in the tank.Eventually, however, during the run of the tunnel there will be some point intime at which p 0becomes too small and the pressure ratio p0/pBrequired to run the tunnel dips below that required to maintain the proper isentropicﬂow through the nozzle. This is the effective end of the test time.728 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Ap0 pB (a) Blowdown supersonic tunnelDiffuser Test section Settling chamberHigh pressure air storage tank p0 (c) Pressure-vacuum supersonic tunnelDiffuser Test section Nozzle Settling chamberHigh pressure air storage tankNozzle Bp0 = pa (b) Indraft supersonic tunnelDiffuser Test section Nozzle Vacuum sphere pB Vacuum sphere pBScreen Figure 10.24 Supersonic wind tunnel conﬁgurations. (b) Indraft tunnel (Figure 10.24 b):A vacuum tank evacuated to a very low pressure pBis connected to the exit of the tunnel. The entrance to the tunnel is open to the atmosphere, where the atmospheric pressure is pa. When valve Bin front of the vacuum tank is opened, atmospheric air is sucked in through the tunnel entrance, and ﬂow starts through the tunnel. The total pressure at the entrance to the tunnel is p0=pa, and the pressure ratio across the tunnel is p0/pB. As the run continues, air ﬁlls the vacuum tank andpBincreases. The test run effectively ends when the pressure ratio p0/pBbecomes smaller than that required to maintain isentropic ﬂow through the nozzle. (c) Pressure-vacuum Tunnel (Figure 10.24 c):This tunnel design is a combination of the two already described earlier—it is a kind of “push-pull”CHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 729 Cooling tower Air coolerDryerOil reservoirReturn passagep0 (d) Closed-circuit, continuous flow, supersonic wind tunnelNotshownDiffuser Test section Nozzle Compressor Motor drive Figure 10.24 (Continued) arrangement. Here, the inlet to the tunnel is connected to a high-pressure storage tank with pressure p0, and the exit of the tunnel is connected to an evacuated tank at pressure pB. The pressure ratio across the tunnel is p0/pB. During the running of the tunnel, p0decreases and pBincreases, and the run terminates when p0/pBbecomes too small to support isentropic ﬂow through the supersonic nozzle. This type of arrangement is speciﬁcally usedfor hypersonic wind tunnels where very large pressure ratios are required toproduce the requisite test section Mach numbers at Mach 5 and higher. Note that the tunnels sketched in Figure 10.24 a–chave run times that are lim- ited by the storage capacity of the high-pressure tank and/or the volume capacity of the vacuum tank. Hence, these tunnels are in a class of intermittent tunnels. This leads to a fourth class of wind tunnel, as follows. (d) Closed-circuit Continuous Flow Tunnel (Figure 10.24 d):This concept is not unlike the continuous ﬂow closed-circuit subsonic wind tunnels discussed in Sections 3.3 and 3.23, and sketched in Figure 3.8b , except that the power source that drives the supersonic tunnel must be much stronger inorder to maintain the proper isentropic pressure ratio across the supersonicnozzle. Referring to Figure 10.24d , there is a loss of total pressure throughout the circuit due to shock waves occurring on a model in the testsection and shock waves in the diffuser, and due to friction losses in theboundary layers formed along the tunnel walls. The function of the power730 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow source in the continuous ﬂow tunnel is mainly to restore this loss of total pressure. As sketched in Figure 10.24d , the power source is frequently an axial-ﬂow compressor mounted in the tunnel circuit upstream of the nozzle,driven by an electric motor or diesel engine connected to the compressorexternally through an axle. The four types of supersonic wind tunnels sketched in Figure 10.24 a–dhave their advantages and disadvantages. A thorough discussion can be found in Pope and Goin, High-Speed Wind Tunnel Testing, Kreieger, New York, 1978. For our purposes here, we note that intermittent tunnels in general are simpler and easierto design and build, and hence are particular favorites for academic institutions.On the other hand, their limited running times can restrict the amount and typeof data to be taken. On the whole, intermittent facilities are much less expensive.Continuous ﬂow supersonic tunnels tend to be large and expensive; for the mostpart they are found at large government laboratories. Challenge: You wish to design a Mach 2 supersonic wind tunnel that is capable of testing airplane models like the low boom conﬁguration sketched in Figure 9.43. You want the test section to accommodate four-foot-long models with wing spansthat are on the order of two feet. In order to achieve turbulent boundary-layer ﬂowover the test model (to try to simulate the turbulent boundary layers encountered infull-scale ﬂight), you would like to have a Reynolds number of at least 10 millionbased on the length of the model. Set up the conceptual design of a supersonicwind tunnel to meet these speciﬁcations. Solution: To determine the size of the test section that can properly accommodate the speciﬁed model size, we rely once again on previous experience. Pope and Goin in their book High-Speed Wind Tunnel Testing recommend a size that will ensure that shock and expansion waves generated by the model will reﬂect fromthe walls of the test section far enough downstream that the reﬂected waves will notimpinge back on the model (this is only common sense). Figure 10.25 is a sketchof a four-foot-long slender conﬁguration (such as that sketched in Figure 9.43). h 2 ftl = 4 ft /H9262 = 30° /H9262 = 30° Figure 10.25 Wave generation from a test model, and reﬂection from the tunnel wall.CHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 731 For simplicity, assume the bow shock wave is weak and can be simulated by a Mach wave, as sketched in Figure 10.25. The minimum height of the modelcenterline above the lower wind tunnel wall is denoted by h. At Mach 2, μ=arc sin/parenleftbigg1 M/parenrightbigg =arc sin/parenleftbigg1 2/parenrightbigg =30◦ From the geometry in Figure 10.25, h 2=tanμ=tan 30◦=0.577 h=1.155 ft The total allowable minimum height of the test section is then 2 h=2.31 ft. For the tunnel design, however, we need to be somewhat conservative. The waves from the model are ﬁnite shock and expansion waves, not Mach waves,and the wave angles will be larger than 30 degrees. Therefore, hwill be larger than 1.155 ft and the total test section height should be made larger than 2.31 ft.A word of caution, however. The overall size of the wind tunnel will be governedby the size of the test section; the larger the size, the more mass ﬂow will passthrough the tunnel, with consequent increases in power requirements and costs ofoperation, not to mention the initial construction cost of the tunnel. Let us apply aconservative “factor of safety” on the height of the test section, i.e., let us designthe test section height to be 3.5 ft. Also, since the length of the model is four feetand we want the entire model length to easily ﬁt within the test section, we willdesign the length of the test section to be ﬁve feet. Finally, to accommodate amodel wing span of two feet and to minimize side-wall effects on the ﬂow overthe wind, we choose a test section width of 3 ft. In summary the conceptual designsize of the test section will be a length, width, and height of 5 ft, 3 ft, and 3.5 ft,respectively. Our next step is the choice of the type of supersonic tunnel: blowdown, in- draft, pressure-vacuum, or closed-circuit continuous ﬂow. This choice may bepartly determined by the requirement for a Reynolds number of 10 7based on test model length, i.e., for a length of four feet. Also the choice may be dictatedby the laboratory space available to house the tunnel. Other considerations maybe the availability of existing equipment in the laboratory such as compressors,high-pressure air storage tanks, and instrumentation—the realities of life in ex-perimental work. So, for our present Integrated Work Challenge, there is no “rightchoice” of the type of supersonic tunnel to be made—much like the design ofan airplane that depends on a number of technical compromises. See Pope andGoin, High-Speed Wind Tunnel Testing, for an extensive discussion of such design matters. In this light, we will proceed as follows. Because of its relative mechanical simplicity and compact size, let us consider a blowdown tunnel, estimate therunning conditions, and see if the Reynolds number requirement is satisﬁed.The ﬂow through the blowdown tunnel is dumped directly to the surroundingatmosphere at the diffuser exit (Figure 10.24a) with a back pressure p Bat the exit732 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow that ideally is equal to the atmospheric pressure, pa. This ideal case, however, corresponds to the ﬂow through the diffuser being slowed to a low subsonic velocity at the exit, and hence nature will impress the surrounding atmosphericpressure p adirectly at the exit, giving an overall pressure ratio across the tunnel ofp0/pa. If the reservoir pressure in the air storage tank were at a higher value of p0required to run the tunnel, the overall pressure levels through the tunnel would be higher, and the pressure at the diffuser exit would be higher than required. Atthe very least, this will lead to a higher velocity ﬂow at the diffuser exit—a wasteof energy and a reduction of operating efﬁciency. If p 0in the reservoir is high enough, the ﬂow through the divergent downstream section of the diffuser, afterbeing reduced to Mach 1 in the diffuser throat, might even become supersonicagain, with a supersonic exit ﬂow blasting out into the laboratory surroundings.This would create an intolerable noise level in the laboratory, as well as beingtotally inefﬁcient. Therefore, in this problem we will design a blowdown tunnelwith just the minimum overall pressure ratio p 0/pB=p0/pasufﬁcient to achieve isentropic ﬂow in the nozzle with shock-free ﬂow entering the test section. In this calculation, we ﬁrst estimate the loss of total pressure through the tunnel. Boundary layers throughout the tunnel increase the entropy level of theﬂow and result in a loss of total pressure. This loss is small, however, comparedwith losses across shock waves from the model mounted in the test section,and especially across the shock waves that occur in the diffuser, as sketched inFigure 10.17b . For conceptual design purposes, we assume the shock losses are equivalent to the total pressure loss across a normal shock wave at the design testsection Mach number; this “normal shock efﬁciency” is a rule of thumb frequentlyused for estimating losses in the supersonic diffuser, especially in the design ofhypersonic tunnels. We will use this rule of thumb here. At Mach 2, from Appendix B, p 02 p01=0.7209 Assuming that p02is the total pressure at the diffuser exit and the ﬂow velocity is small, we assume p02=pa=1 atm. Thus, p01=p02 0.7209=1 0.7209 p01=1.387 atm Ignoring all other losses, this implies that we need a reservoir pressure in the airstorage tank of 1.387 atm. There is yet another consideration, namely, starting a supersonic tunnel. If we would simply open some valves and impose the minimum pressure ratio of1.387 across the tunnel, the losses across the waves associated with the transientstarting process might be too large, and the ﬂow process struggles to start itself.In this case, the starting pressure ratio across the tunnel needs to be higher thanthe running pressure ratio. It is difﬁcult to estimate the starting pressure ratio,especially when there is a model mounted in the test section. This is somethingCHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 733 usually determined empirically. Finally, speaking of the test model, it should not be so large as to cause a “blockage” of the mass ﬂow through the tunnel. Thecross-sectional area of the model should be a small fraction of the test sectioncross-section area. The maximum size model allowed in the test section withoutcausing blockage is a function of model shape (streamlined and slender versusblunt) and test section Mach number. The maximum model size allowable is alsosomething usually determined empirically. These practical considerations notwithstanding, we might conservatively de- sign for an overall pressure ratio of about 2, which can be throttled down to theminimum design value of 1.387 after the tunnel is properly started. Question: For an operating value of p 0=1.387 atm in the reservoir, will the Reynolds number of the ﬂow over the model satisfy our speciﬁcation of 107? To make this estimate, we ﬁrst calculate the air density, ρ0, in the reservoir, assuming the air temperature in the reservoir is the standard sea level value of T0=519◦R. ρ0=p0 RT0=(1.387)(2116) (1716)(519)=0.00329slug ft3 At Mach 2 in the test section, from Appendix A, ρ0 ρ=4.347 andT0 T=1.8 Thus, in the test section, the isentropic ﬂow properties are ρ=ρ0 4.347=0.00329 4.347=7.568×10−4slug ft3 and T=T0 1.8=519 1.8=288◦R The speed of sound in the test section is a=/radicalbig γRT=/radicalbig (1.4)(1716)(288) =831.8 ft/s and the ﬂow velocity is V=Ma=2(831.8) =1664 ft/s The viscosity coefﬁcient as a function of temperature is given in Figure 1.50, but in SI units. Converting Tinto degrees Kelvin, we have T=280 1.8=155.6K Extrapolating the linear variation shown in Figure 1.50 to a temperature of 155 K,we have μ=1.05×10 −5kg/(m)(s). Converting to the Engineering system of units where 1 slug =14.594 kg, and 1 ft =0.3048 m, we have μ=1.05×10−5kg (m)(s)/bracketleftbigg1 slug 14.594 kg/bracketrightbigg0.3048 m 1 ft=2.19×10−7slug (ft)(s)734 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Therefore, for the reservoir conditions in the high pressure air storage tank, the Reynolds number for the four-footlong model in the test section is: Re=ρVL μ=(7.568 ×10−4)(1664)(4) 2.19×10−7=23×106 This value of a Reynolds number of 23 million exceeds the stipulated requirementof 10 million, so our conceptual design of the blowdown tunnel is on track so far. Our tunnel is bordering on being rather large, and the next questions are: What is the mass ﬂow through the tunnel? What running times do we want? Howlarge an air storage tank is going to be required? These are all related questions. First, consider the mass ﬂow. A closed-form expression for the mass ﬂow is given in the end-of-chapter problem 10.5 as ˙m=p 0A∗ √T0/radicalBigg γ R/parenleftbigg2 γ+1/parenrightbigg(γ+1)/(γ −1) (C10.1) where A∗is the nozzle throat area. At Mach 2, from Appendix A, Ae/A∗=1.687. Since our tunnel is a “two-dimensional” tunnel with a nozzle and test-sectioncross-sectional areas being rectangular and with the height of the nozzle exitbeing h e=3.5 ft, then the height of the nozzle throat, h∗, is h∗=he/1.687 =3.5 1.687=2.075 ft The width of the nozzle is 3 ft. Hence, A∗=(2.075)(3) =6.225 ft2. For p0=1.387 atm, where 1 atm =2116 lb/ft2, and hence p0=(1.387)(2116) = 2935 lb/ft2, and where T0=519◦R, we have from Equation (C10.1), ˙m=(2935)(6.225)√ 519/bracketleftBigg 1.4 1716/parenleftbigg2 1.4+1/parenrightbigg2.4/0.4/bracketrightBigg =802(2.73 ×10−4)=0.219 slug/s Since 32.2 lb m=1 slug, the mass ﬂow is ˙m=(0.219)(32.2) =7.05 lb m/s What about running time? This is a matter of choice. It should be long enough to allow all measurements to be made on the test model—pressure, temperature,force, etc. We choose a running time of one minute for this purpose. Therefore,during that minute, the total mass of air ﬂowing through the tunnel is m=(7.05)(60) =423 lb m Our high-pressure air storage tank should be large enough to discharge 423 lb m of air through the tunnel and still have enough air left in the tank to maintain areservoir pressure of p 0=1.387 atm throughout the run. For starting the tunnel, we have estimated that initially p0=2 atm is required. After the tunnel is started, although the tank pressure initially remains above the stipulated 1.387 atm, the airpressure entering the nozzle can be reduced to the desired 1.387 atm by passingCHAPTER 10 Compressible Flow Through Nozzles, Diffusers, and Wind Tunnels 735 through a throttling valve. What we want during the tunnel run is for the pressure in the tank to remain at or above 1.387 atm. From the equation of state pV=MRT , where Vis the tank volume and Mis the mass of air in the tank we have for ﬁxed VandT, pi pf=Mi Mf(C10.2) where piandpfare the initial and ﬁnal pressures in the tank, respectively, and MiandMfare the initial and ﬁnal mass in the tank, respectively. pi pf=2 1.387=1.44 Hence, Mi/Mf=1.44 or, Mf=Mi 1.44(C10.3) Also, the difference between the initial and ﬁnal mass in the tank is equal to themass discharged during the one-minute run, M i−Mf=423 lb (C10.4) Substituting Equation (10.3) into Equation (10.4), we have Mi−Mi 1.44=423 1.44 Mi−Mi=(423)(1.44) 0.44 Mi=609.1 Mi=609.1 0.44=1384 lb m So the storage tank must contain at least 1384 lb mof air at p=2 atm at the beginning of the run. Finally, we can now estimate the volume of the storage tank,which must hold 1384 lb mof air at a pressure of 2 atm initially. The mass in slugs isM=1384 32.2=43 slug, and the pressure in lb/ft2isp=2(2116) =4232 lb/ft2. Thus, V=MRT p=(43)(1716)(519) 4232=9049 ft3 How large is this tank? Let us assume a cylindrical tank with a 12-foot diameter. Lethbe the height of the tank. The volume of the tank is V=πd2 4hor, h=4V πd2=(4)(9049) π(12)2=80 ft736 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Wow! This is a tall tank—too tall for normal laboratory space. Here is the impor- tance of a conceptual design process. Instead of storing the air at 2 atm pressure,let us store it at 20 atm and then feed the air to the tunnel through a throttlingvalve. A 20 atm tank would decrease the tank volume by a factor of 10 comparedwith the 2 atm tank, yielding a height of 8 ft—a much more reasonable value. We have barely scratched the surface of the conceptual design of a supersonic tunnel. A more thorough process would be to look at the other types of supersonictunnels, not just the blowdown tunnel as we have done here. And then we couldcompare all four types as to which might be the best to satisfy our speciﬁcations.But we have done enough here to give you the ﬂavor. Our blowdown tunnel will dothe job. It is a big tunnel, driven by the rather large speciﬁed size of the test model,and hence requiring a large supersonic test section. Supersonic wind tunnels fortesting models of this sort tend to be big—it is just the nature of the beast! 10.9 PROBLEMS 10.1 The reservoir pressure and temperature for a convergent-divergent nozzleare 5 atm and 520 ◦R, respectively. The ﬂow is expanded isentropically to supersonic speed at the nozzle exit. If the exit-to-throat area ratio is 2.193,calculate the following properties at the exit: M e,pe,Te,ρe,ue,p0,e,T0,e. 10.2 A ﬂow is isentropically expanded to supersonic speeds in aconvergent-divergent nozzle.

What is the exit-to-throat area ratio of the tunnel nozzle? 10.11 The nozzle of a supersonic wind tunnel has an exit-to-throat area ratioof 6.79. When the tunnel is running, a Pitot tube mounted in the testsection measures 1.448 atm. What is the reservoir pressure for thetunnel? 10.12 We wish to design a supersonic wind tunnel that produces a Mach 2.8ﬂow at standard sea level conditions in the test section and has a massﬂow of air equal to 1 slug/s. Calculate the necessary reservoir pressureand temperature, the nozzle throat and exit areas, and the diffuser throatarea. 10.13 Consider a rocket engine burning hydrogen and oxygen. The total massﬂow of the propellant plus oxidizer into the combustion chamber is287.2 kg/s. The combustion chamber temperature is 3600 K. Assumethat the combustion chamber is a low-velocity reservoir for the rocketengine. If the area of the rocket nozzle throat is 0.2m 2, calculate the combustion chamber (reservoir) pressure. Assume that the gas that ﬂowsthrough the engine has a ratio of speciﬁc heats, γ=1.2, and a molecular weight of 16. 10.14 For supersonic and hypersonic wind tunnels, a diffuser efﬁciency, η D, can be deﬁned as the ratio of the total pressures at the diffuser exit andnozzle reservoir, divided by the total pressure ratio across a normal shockat the test-section Mach number. This is a measure of the efﬁciency ofthe diffuser relative to normal shock pressure recovery. Consider asupersonic wind tunnel designed for a test-section Mach number of 3.0which exhausts directly to the atmosphere. The diffuser efﬁciency is 1.2.Calculate the minimum reservoir pressure necessary for running thetunnel. 10.15 Return to Problem 9.18, where the average Mach number across thetwo-dimensional ﬂow in a duct was calculated, and where θfor the upper wall was 3 ◦. Assuming quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow, calculate the Mach number at the location ABin the duct. 10.16 Return to Problem 9.19, where the average Mach number across thetwo-dimensional ﬂow in a duct was calculated, and where θfor the upper wall was 30 ◦. Assuming quasi-one-dimensional ﬂow, calculate the Mach number at the location ABin the duct.738 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 10.17 A horizontal ﬂow initially at Mach 1 ﬂows over a downward-sloping expansion corner, thus creating a centered Prandtl-Meyer expansionwave. The streamlines that enter the head of the expansion wave curvesmoothly and continuously downward through the expansion fan, andemerge parallel to the downward sloping surface downstream of the tailof the wave, as shown in Figure 9.2b. Imagine a polar coordinate system r,/Phi1with its origin at the expansion corner (the vertex of the Prandtl- Meyer expansion wave), with rthe usual radial distance along a ray from the origin and /Phi1the polar angle of rmeasured from the horizontal. Because the upstream ﬂow is at Mach 1, the head of the expansion fan isa Mach wave perpendicular to the free stream. Consider a givenstreamline entering the expansion wave at the point ( r,/Phi1)=( r ∗,π/2). Construct a method for calculating the shape of this streamline as afunction of rand/Phi1through the expansion fan. Note: To solve this problem, material from both Chapters 9 and 10 is required. 10.18 Consider a centered expansion wave where M 1=1.0 and M2=1.6. Using the method developed in Problem 10.17, plot to scale a streamlinethat passes through the expansion wave.CHAPTER11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory During the war a British engineer named Frank Whittle invented the jet engine, and deHavilland built the ﬁrst production-type model. He produced a jet planenamed Vampire, the ﬁrst to exceed 500 mph. Then he built the experimentalDH 108, and released it to young Geoffrey for test. In the ﬁrst cautious trials thenew plane behaved beautifully; but as Geoffrey stepped up the speed heunsuspectingly drew closer to an invisible wall in the sky then unknown toanyone, later named the sound barrier, which can destroy a plane not designedto pierce it. One evening he hit the speed of sound, and the plane disintegrated.Young Geoffrey’s body was not found for ten days. From the Royal Air Force FlyingReview, as condensed in Reader’s Digest, 1959 PREVIEW BOX We learned all about airfoils in Chapter 4—but did we really? Chapter 4 dealt with airfoils in low-speedincompressible ﬂow. What happens when we have ahigh-speed compressible ﬂow over these airfoils? Bythis stage of our discussions about compressible ﬂow,you might expect compressibility to make some dif-ferences, and you would be correct. But what differ-ences, and by how much? This chapter and the nextgive some answers. The present chapter deals with airfoils in a high- speed subsonic ﬂow. What happens when an airfoil isﬂown at high subsonic Mach numbers, near the speedof sound? How does compressibility change the airfoilproperties, and by how much? How do we analyze andcalculate these compressibility effects? The answersare given in this chapter. In addition, we will see thatas Mach 1 is approached, the drag of an airfoil sud-denly skyrockets and looks like it is going out of sight(the so-called sound barrier, as sometimes referencedin the popular literature). What is going on here? Howdo we deal with it? 739740 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow These are all very important and very practical questions, and they are all addressed in this chapter. Every time you ﬂy in a high-speed jet transport, suchas a Boeing 777 cruising at a Mach number of 0.85,you are encountering the phenomena that drive thesequestions. Without proper answers, we would neverbe able to design this type of airplane, and we wouldalways be relegated to ﬂying slower—something thatthe pace of modern life would not easily tolerate. Sopay close attention to the material in this chapter. But be aware. Our ﬁrst four chapters dealing with the basics of compressible ﬂow (Chapters 7–10) usedmathematics at essentially the level of algebra. To gofurther in our study of compressible ﬂow, especiallyto answer the questions posed here, we have to re-turn to the world of partial differential equations. Butthis is no big deal; we have been there before in ourdiscussions of incompressible ﬂow in Part 1 of thisbook. So jump right in to the material of this chapter.I predict that you will experience some increase intechnical maturity as you study this material, and thatyou will enjoy it. After all, here you will be dealingwith some of the most important and exciting appli-cations in modern aerodynamics. 11.1 INTRODUCTION The above quotation refers to an accident that took place on September 27, 1946, when Geoffrey deHavilland, son of the famed British airplane designerSir Geoffrey deHavilland, took the D. H. 108 Swallow up for an attack on theworld’s speed record. At that time, no airplane had ﬂown at or beyond the speed ofsound. The Swallow was an experimental jet-propelled aircraft with swept wingsand no tail. During its ﬁrst high-speed, low-level run, the Swallow encounteredmajor compressibility problems and broke up in the air. deHavilland was killedinstantly. This accident strengthened the opinion of many that Mach 1 stood as abarrier to manned ﬂight and that no airplane would ever ﬂy faster than the speedof sound. This myth of the “sound barrier” originated in the early 1930s. It was infull force by the time of the V olta Conference in 1935 (see Section 7.1). In lightof the opening quotation, the idea of a sound barrier was still being discussed inthe popular literature as late as 1959, 12 years after the ﬁrst successful supersonicﬂight by Captain Charles Yeager on October 14, 1947. Of course, we know today that the sound barrier is indeed a myth; the super- sonic transport Concorde ﬂew at Mach 2, and some military aircraft are capableof Mach 3 and slightly beyond. The X-15 hypersonic research airplane has ﬂownat Mach 7, and the Apollo lunar return capsule successfully reentered the earth’satmosphere at Mach 36. Supersonic ﬂight is now an everyday occurrence. So,what caused the early concern about a sound barrier? In the present chapter, wedevelop a theory applicable to high-speed subsonic ﬂight, and we see how thetheory predicts a monotonically increasing drag going to inﬁnity as M ∞→1. It was this type of result that led some people in the early 1930s to believe that ﬂightbeyond the speed of sound was impossible. However, we also show in this chapterthat the approximations made in the theory break down near Mach 1 and that inreality, although the drag coefﬁcient at Mach 1 is large, it is still a manageableﬁnite number.CHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 741 Speciﬁcally, the purpose of this chapter is to examine the properties of two- dimensional airfoils at Mach numbers above 0.3, where we can no longer assume incompressible ﬂow, but below Mach 1. That is, this chapter is an extension ofthe airfoil discussions in Chapter 4 (which applied to incompressible ﬂow) to thehigh-speed subsonic regime. In the process, we climb to a new tier in our study of compressible ﬂow. If you survey our discussions so far of compressible ﬂow, you will observe that theytreat one-dimensional cases such as normal shock waves and ﬂows in ducts. Evenoblique shock waves, which are two- and three-dimensional in nature, dependonly on the component of Mach number normal to the wave. Therefore, we havenot been explicitly concerned with a multidimensional ﬂow. As a consequence,note that the types of equations which allow an analysis of these ﬂows are alge- braic equations, and hence are relatively easy to solve in comparison with partial differential equations. In Chapters 8 to 10, we have dealt primarily with suchalgebraic equations. These algebraic equations were obtained by applying the in-tegral forms of the conservation equations [Equations (2.48), (2.64), and (2.95)]to appropriate control volumes where the ﬂow properties were uniform over theinﬂow and outﬂow faces of the control volume. However, for general two- andthree-dimensional ﬂows, we are usually not afforded such a luxury. Instead, wemust deal directly with the governing equations in their partial differential equa-tion form (see Chapter 2). Such is the nature of the present chapter. Indeed, forthe remainder of our aerodynamic discussions in this book, we appeal mainly tothe differential forms of the continuity, momentum, and energy equations [suchas Equations (2.52), (2.113 atoc), and (2.114)]. The road map for this chapter is given in Figure 11.1. We are going to return to the concept of a velocity potential, ﬁrst introduced in Section 2.15. We are goingto combine our governing equations so as to obtain a single equation simply in Velocity potential equation Linearized velocity potential equation Critical Mach numberPrandtl-Glauert compressibility correction Improved compressibility correction The area rule for transonic flow Supercritical airfoils Figure 11.1 Road map for Chapter 11.742 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow terms of the velocity potential; that is, we are going to obtain for compressible ﬂow an equation analogous to Laplace’s equation derived for incompressible ﬂowin Section 3.7 [see Equation (3.40)]. However, unlike Laplace’s equation, whichis linear, the exact velocity potential equation for compressible ﬂow is nonlin-ear. By making suitable approximations, we are able to linearize this equationand apply it to thin airfoils at small angles of attack. The results enable us tocorrect incompressible airfoil data for the effects of compressibility—so-calledcompressibility corrections. Finally, we conclude this chapter by discussing sev-eral practical aspects of airfoil and general wing-body aerodynamics at speedsnear Mach 1. 11.2 THE VELOCITY POTENTIAL EQUATION The inviscid, compressible, subsonic ﬂow over a body immersed in a uniformstream is irrotational; there is no mechanism in such a ﬂow to start rotating the ﬂuid elements (see Section 2.12). Thus, a velocity potential (see Section 2.15) canbe deﬁned. Since we are dealing with irrotational ﬂow and the velocity potential,review Sections 2.12 and 2.15 before progressing further. Consider two-dimensional, steady, irrotational, isentropic ﬂow. A velocity potential, φ=φ(x,y), can be deﬁned such that [from Equation (2.154)] V=∇φ (11.1) or in terms of the cartesian velocity components, u=∂φ ∂x(11.2a) v=∂φ ∂y(11.2b) Let us proceed to obtain an equation for φwhich represents a combination of the continuity, momentum, and energy equations. Such an equation would bevery useful, because it would be simply one governing equation in terms of oneunknown, namely the velocity potential φ. The continuity equation for steady, two-dimensional ﬂow is obtained from Equation (2.52) as ∂(ρu) ∂x+∂(ρv) ∂y=0 (11.3) or ρ∂u ∂x+u∂ρ ∂x+v∂ρ ∂y+ρ∂v ∂y=0 (11.4) Substituting Equations (11.2 aandb) into (11.4), we have ρ∂2φ ∂x2+∂φ ∂x∂ρ ∂x+∂φ ∂y∂ρ ∂y+ρ∂2φ ∂y2=0 or ρ/parenleftbigg∂2φ ∂x2+∂2φ ∂y2/parenrightbigg +∂φ ∂x∂ρ ∂x+∂φ ∂y∂ρ ∂y=0 (11.5)CHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 743 We are attempting to obtain an equation completely in terms of φ; hence, we need to eliminate ρfrom Equation (11.5). To do this, consider the momentum equation in terms of Euler’s equation: dp=−ρV dV (3.12) This equation holds for a steady, compressible, inviscid ﬂow and relates pand Valong a streamline. It can readily be shown that Equation (3.12) holds in anydirection throughout an irrotational ﬂow, not just along a streamline (try it yourself). Therefore, from Equations (3.12) and (11.2 aandb), we have dp=−ρV dV =−ρ 2d(V2)=−ρ 2d(u2+v2) or dp=−ρ 2d/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂x/parenrightbigg2 +/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂y/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg (11.6) Recall that we are also considering the ﬂow to be isentropic. Hence, any change in pressure dpin the ﬂow is automatically accompanied by a corresponding isentropic change in density dρ. Thus, by deﬁnition dp dρ=/parenleftbigg∂p ∂ρ/parenrightbigg s(11.7) The right-hand side of Equation (11.7) is simply the square of the speed of sound.Thus, Equation (11.7) yields dp=a 2dρ (11.8) Substituting Equation (11.8) for the left side of Equation (11.6), we have dρ=−ρ 2a2d/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂x/parenrightbigg2 +/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂y/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg (11.9) Considering changes in the xdirection, Equation (11.9) directly yields ∂ρ ∂x=−ρ 2a2∂ ∂x/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂x/parenrightbigg2 +/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂y/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg or∂ρ ∂x=−ρ a2/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂x∂2φ ∂x2+∂φ ∂y∂2φ ∂x∂y/parenrightbigg (11.10) Similarly, for changes in the ydirection, Equation (11.9) gives ∂ρ ∂y=−ρ a2/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂x∂2φ ∂x∂y+∂φ ∂y∂2φ ∂y2/parenrightbigg (11.11)744 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Substituting Equations (11.10) and (11.11) into (11.5), canceling the ρwhich appears in each term, and factoring out the second derivatives of φ, we obtain /bracketleftBigg 1−1 a2/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂x/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg ∂2φ ∂x2+/bracketleftBigg 1−1 a2/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂y/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg ∂2φ ∂y2 −2 a2/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂x/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂y/parenrightbigg∂2φ ∂x∂y=0(11.12) which is called the velocity potential equation. It is almost completely in terms ofφ; only the speed of sound appears in addition to φ. However, acan be readily expressed in terms of φas follows. From Equation (8.33), we have a2=a2 0−γ−1 2V2=a2 0−γ−1 2(u2+v2) =a2 0−γ−1 2/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂x/parenrightbigg2 +/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂y/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg (11.13) Since a0is a known constant of the ﬂow, Equation (11.13) gives the speed of sound aas a function of φ. Hence, substitution of Equation (11.13) into (11.12) yields a single partial differential equation in terms of the unknown φ. This equation represents a combination of the continuity, momentum, and energy equations. In principle, it can be solved to obtain φfor the ﬂow ﬁeld around any two-dimensional shape, subject of course to the usual boundary conditions atinﬁnity and along the body surface. These boundary conditions on φare detailed in Section 3.7, and are given by Equations (3.47 aandb) and (3.48b ). Because Equation (11.12) [along with Equation (11.13)] is a single equa- tion in terms of one dependent variable φ, the analysis of isentropic, irrotational, steady, compressible ﬂow is greatly simpliﬁed—we only have to solve one equa-tion instead of three or more. Once φis known, all the other ﬂow variables are directly obtained as follows: 1.Calculate uandvfrom Equations (11.2 aandb). 2.Calculate afrom Equation (11.13). 3.Calculate M=V/a=√ u2+v2/a. 4.Calculate T,p, andρfrom Equations (8.40), (8.42), and (8.43), respectively. In these equations, the total conditions T0,p0, andρ0are known quantities; they are constant throughout the ﬂow ﬁeld and hence are obtained from the given freestream conditions. Although Equation (11.12) has the advantage of being one equation with one unknown, it also has the distinct disadvantage of being a nonlinear partial differ- ential equation. Such nonlinear equations are very difﬁcult to solve analytically, and in modern aerodynamics, solutions of Equation (11.12) are usually sought bymeans of sophisticated ﬁnite-difference numerical techniques. Indeed, no gen-eral analytical solution of Equation (11.12) has been found to this day. ContrastCHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 745 this situation with that for incompressible ﬂow, which is governed by Laplace’s equation—a linear partial differential equation for which numerous analytical solutions are well known. Given this situation, aerodynamicists over the years have made assumptions regarding the physical nature of the ﬂow ﬁeld which are designed to simplifyEquation (11.12). These assumptions limit our considerations to the ﬂow overslender bodies at small angles of attack. For subsonic and supersonic ﬂows, theseassumptions lead to an approximate form of Equation (11.12) which is linear, and hence can be solved analytically. These matters are the subject of the nextsection. Keep in mind that, within the framework of steady, irrotational, isentropic ﬂow, Equation (11.12) is exact and holds for all Mach numbers, from subsonic to hypersonic, and for all two-dimensional body shapes, thin and thick. 11.3 THE LINEARIZED VELOCITY POTENTIAL EQUATION Consider the two-dimensional, irrotational, isentropic ﬂow over the body shownin Figure 11.2. The body is immersed in a uniform ﬂow with velocity V ∞oriented in the xdirection. At an arbitrary point Pin the ﬂow ﬁeld, the velocity is Vwith thexandycomponents given by uandv, respectively. Let us now visualize the velocity Vas the sum of the uniform ﬂow velocity plus some extra increments in velocity. For example, the xcomponent of velocity uin Figure 11.2 can be visualized as V∞plus an increment in velocity (positive or negative). Similarly, theycomponent of velocity vcan be visualized as a simple increment itself, be- cause the uniform ﬂow has a zero component in the ydirection. These increments are called perturbations, and u=V∞+ˆu v=ˆv where ˆuand ˆvare called the perturbation velocities. These perturbation velocities are not necessarily small; indeed, they can be quite large in the stagnation regionin front of the blunt nose of the body shown in Figure 11.2. In the same vein, V/H11009y vV P uu = V/H11009 + uˆ /H9263 = /H9263ˆ x Figure 11.2 Uniform ﬂow and perturbed ﬂow.746 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow because V=∇φ, we can deﬁne a perturbation velocity potential ˆφsuch that φ=V∞x+ˆφ where ∂ˆφ ∂x=ˆu ∂ˆφ ∂y=ˆv Hence,∂φ ∂x=V∞+∂ˆφ ∂x∂φ ∂y=∂ˆφ ∂y ∂2φ ∂x2=∂2ˆφ ∂x2∂2φ ∂y2=∂2ˆφ ∂y2∂2φ ∂x∂y=∂2ˆφ ∂x∂y Substituting the above deﬁnitions into Equation (11.12), and multiplying by a2, we obtain⎡ ⎣a2−/parenleftBigg V∞+∂ˆφ ∂x/parenrightBigg2⎤⎦ ∂2ˆφ ∂x2+⎡⎣ a2−/parenleftBigg ∂ˆφ ∂y/parenrightBigg2⎤⎦ ∂2ˆφ ∂y2 (11.14) −2/parenleftBigg V∞+∂ˆφ ∂x/parenrightBigg/parenleftBigg ∂ˆφ ∂y/parenrightBigg ∂2ˆφ ∂x∂y=0 Equation (11.14) is called the perturbation velocity potential equation. It is pre- cisely the same equation as Equation (11.12) except that it is expressed in terms ofˆφinstead of φ. It is still a nonlinear equation. To obtain better physical insight in some of our subsequent discussion, let us recast Equation (11.14) in terms of the perturbation velocities. From the deﬁnitionofˆφgiven earlier, Equation (11.14) can be written as [a 2−(V∞+ˆu)2]∂ˆu ∂x+(a2−ˆv2)∂ˆv ∂y−2(V∞+ˆu)ˆv∂ˆu ∂y=0 (11.14a) From the energy equation in the form of Equation (8.32), we have a2 ∞ γ−1+V2 ∞ 2=a2 γ−1+(V∞+ˆu)2+ˆv2 2(11.15) Substituting Equation (11.15) into (11.14 a), and algebraically rearranging, we obtain /parenleftbig1−M2 ∞/parenrightbig∂ˆu ∂x+∂ˆv ∂y=M2 ∞/bracketleftbigg (γ+1)ˆu V∞+γ+1 2ˆu2 V2 ∞+γ−1 2ˆv2 V2 ∞/bracketrightbigg∂ˆu ∂x +M2 ∞/bracketleftbigg (γ−1)ˆu V∞+γ+1 2ˆv2 V2 ∞+γ−1 2ˆu2 V2 ∞/bracketrightbigg∂ˆv ∂y +M2 ∞/bracketleftbiggˆv V∞/parenleftbigg 1+ˆu V∞/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg∂ˆu ∂y+∂ˆv ∂x/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (11.16)CHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 747 Equation (11.16) is still exact for irrotational, isentropic ﬂow. Note that the left- hand side of Equation (11.16) is linear but the right-hand side is nonlinear. Also,keep in mind that the size of the perturbations ˆuand ˆvcan be large or small; Equation (11.16) holds for both cases. Let us now limit our considerations to small perturbations; that is, assume that the body in Figure 11.2 is a slender body at small angle of attack. In such a case, ˆuand ˆvwill be small in comparison with V ∞. Therefore, we have ˆu V∞,ˆv V∞/lessmuch1ˆu2 V2 ∞,ˆv2 V2 ∞/lessmuch /lessmuch1 Keep in mind that products of ˆuand ˆvwith their derivatives are also very small. With this in mind, examine Equation (11.16). Compare like terms (coefﬁcientsof like derivatives) on the left- and right-hand sides of Equation (11.16). We ﬁnd 1.For 0≤M ∞≤0.8 or M∞≥1.2, the magnitude of M2 ∞/bracketleftbigg (γ+1)ˆu V∞+···/bracketrightbigg∂ˆu ∂x is small in comparison with the magnitude of /parenleftbig1−M2 ∞/parenrightbig∂ˆu ∂x Thus, ignore the former term. 2.ForM∞<5 (approximately), M2 ∞/bracketleftbigg (γ−1)ˆu V∞+···/bracketrightbigg∂ˆv ∂y is small in comparison with ∂ˆv/∂y. So ignore the former term. Also, M2 ∞/bracketleftbiggˆv V∞/parenleftbigg 1+ˆu V∞/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg∂ˆu ∂y+∂ˆv ∂x/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg ≈0 With the above order-of-magnitude comparisons, Equation (11.16) reduces to /parenleftbig1−M2 ∞/parenrightbig∂ˆu ∂x+∂ˆv ∂y=0 (11.17) or in terms of the perturbation velocity potential, /parenleftbig1−M2 ∞/parenrightbig∂2ˆφ ∂x2+∂2ˆφ ∂y2=0 (11.18) Examine Equation (11.18). It is a linear partial differential equation, and therefore is inherently simpler to solve than its parent equation, Equation (11.16). However, we have paid a price for this simplicity. Equation (11.18) is no longer exact. It isonly an approximation to the physics of the ﬂow. Due to the assumptions made in748 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow obtaining Equation (11.18), it is reasonably valid (but not exact) for the following combined situations: 1.Small perturbation, that is, thin bodies at small angles of attack 2.Subsonic andsupersonic Mach numbers In contrast, Equation (11.18) is not valid for thick bodies and for large angles of attack. Moreover, it cannot be used for transonic ﬂow, where 0.8 <M∞<1.2, or for hypersonic ﬂow, where M∞>5. We are interested in solving Equation (11.18) in order to obtain the pressure distribution along the surface of a slender body. Since we are now dealing withapproximate equations, it is consistent to obtain a linearized expression for thepressure coefﬁcient—an expression that is approximate to the same degree asEquation (11.18), but which is extremely simple and convenient to use. Thelinearized pressure coefﬁcient can be derived as follows. First, recall the deﬁnition of the pressure coefﬁcient C pgiven in Section 1.5: Cp≡p−p∞ q∞(11.19) where q∞=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞=dynamic pressure. The dynamic pressure can be ex- pressed in terms of M∞as follows: q∞=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞=1 2γp∞ γp∞ρ∞V2 ∞=γ 2p∞/parenleftbiggρ∞ γp∞/parenrightbigg V2 ∞ (11.20) From Equation (8.23), we have a2 ∞=γp∞/ρ∞. Hence, Equation (11.20) becomes q∞=γ 2p∞V2 ∞ a2 ∞=γ 2p∞M2 ∞ (11.21) Substituting Equation (11.21) into (11.19), we have Cp=2 γM2 ∞/parenleftbiggp p∞−1/parenrightbigg (11.22) Equation (11.22) is simply an alternate form of the pressure coefﬁcient expressedin terms of M ∞. It is still an exact representation of the deﬁnition of Cp. To obtain a linearized form of the pressure coefﬁcient, recall that we are dealing with an adiabatic ﬂow of a calorically perfect gas; hence, from Equa-tion (8.39), T+V 2 2cp=T∞+V2 ∞ 2cp(11.23) Recalling from Equation (7.9) that cp=γR/(γ−1), Equation (11.23) can be written as T−T∞=V2 ∞−V2 2γR/(γ−1)(11.24)CHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 749 Also, recalling that a∞=√γRT∞, Equation (11.24) becomes T T∞−1=γ−1 2V2 ∞−V2 γRT∞=γ−1 2V2 ∞−V2 a2 ∞(11.25) In terms of the perturbation velocities V2=(V∞+ˆu)2+ˆv2 Equation (11.25) can be written as T T∞=1−γ−1 2a2 ∞(2ˆuV∞+ˆu2+ˆv2) (11.26) Since the ﬂow is isentropic, p/p∞=(T/T∞)γ/(γ−1), and Equation (11.26) be- comes p p∞=/bracketleftbigg 1−γ−1 2a2 ∞(2ˆuV∞+ˆu2+ˆv2)/bracketrightbiggγ/(γ−1) orp p∞=/bracketleftbigg 1−γ−1 2M2 ∞/parenleftbigg2ˆu V∞+ˆu2+ˆv2 V2 ∞/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbiggγ/(γ−1) (11.27) Equation (11.27) is still an exact expression. However, let us now make the assumption that the perturbations are small, that is, ˆu/V∞/lessmuch1,ˆu2/V2 ∞/lessmuch /lessmuch1, and ˆv2/V2 ∞/lessmuch /lessmuch1. In this case, Equation (11.27) is of the form p p∞=(1−ε)γ/(γ−1)(11.28) where εis small. From the binomial expansion, neglecting higher-order terms, Equation (11.28) becomes p p∞=1−γ γ−1ε+··· (11.29) Comparing Equation (11.27) to (11.29), we can express Equation (11.27) as p p∞=1−γ 2M2 ∞/parenleftbigg2ˆu V∞+ˆu2+ˆv2 V2 ∞/parenrightbigg +··· (11.30) Substituting Equation (11.30) into the expression for the pressure coefﬁcient,Equation (11.22), we obtain C p=2 γM2 ∞/bracketleftbigg 1−γ 2M2 ∞/parenleftbigg2ˆu V∞+ˆu2+ˆv2 V2 ∞/parenrightbigg +···− 1/bracketrightbigg or Cp=−2ˆu V∞−ˆu2+ˆv2 V2 ∞(11.31) Since ˆu2/V2 ∞and ˆv2/V2 ∞/lessmuch /lessmuch1, Equation (11.31) becomes Cp=−2ˆu V∞(11.32)750 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Equation (11.32) is the linearized form for the pressure coefﬁcient; it is valid only for small perturbations. Equation (11.32) is consistent with the linearized perturbation velocity potential equation, Equation (11.18). Note the simplicity ofEquation (11.32); it depends only on the xcomponent of the velocity perturbation, namely, ˆu. To round out our discussion on the basics of the linearized equations, we note that any solution to Equation (11.18) must satisfy the usual boundary conditionsat inﬁnity and at the body surface. At inﬁnity, clearly ˆφ=constant; that is, ˆu=ˆv=0. At the body, the ﬂow-tangency condition holds. Let θbe the angle between the tangent to the surface and the freestream. Then, at the surface, theboundary condition is obtained from Equation (3.48e ): tanθ=v u=ˆv V∞+ˆu(11.33) which is an exact expression for the ﬂow-tangency condition at the body surface.A simpler, approximate expression for Equation (11.33), consistent with lin-earized theory, can be obtained by noting that for small perturbations, ˆu/lessmuchV ∞. Hence, Equation (11.33) becomes ˆv=V∞tanθ or ∂ˆφ ∂y=V∞tanθ (11.34) Equation (11.34) is an approximate expression for the ﬂow-tangency condition at the body surface, with accuracy of the same order as Equations (11.18) and(11.32). 11.4 PRANDTL-GLAUERT COMPRESSIBILITY CORRECTION The aerodynamic theory for incompressible ﬂow over thin airfoils at small anglesof attack was presented in Chapter 4. For aircraft of the period 1903–1940, suchtheory was adequate for predicting airfoil properties. However, with the rapid evo-lution of high-power reciprocating engines spurred by World War II, the velocitiesof military ﬁghter planes began to push close to 450 mi/h. Then, with the adventof the ﬁrst operational jet-propelled airplanes in 1944 (the German Me 262), ﬂightvelocities took a sudden spurt into the 550 mi/h range and faster. As a result, theincompressible ﬂow theory of Chapter 4 was no longer applicable to such aircraft;rather, high-speed airfoil theory had to deal with compressible ﬂow. Because a vastbulk of data and experience had been collected over the years in low-speed aero-dynamics, and because there was no desire to totally discard such data, the naturalapproach to high-speed subsonic aerodynamics was to search for methods thatwould allow relatively simple corrections to existing incompressible ﬂow results which would approximately take into account the effects of compressibility. SuchCHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 751 xy V/H11009Shape of airfoil, y = f(x) /H9263ˆ/H9258V/H11009 + uˆ Figure 11.3 Airfoil in physical space. methods are called compressibility corrections. The ﬁrst, and most widely known of these corrections is the Prandtl-Glauert compressibility correction, to be derived in this section. The Prandtl-Glauert method is based on the linearized perturbationvelocity potential equation given by Equation (11.18). Therefore, it is limited tothin airfoils at small angles of attack. Moreover, it is purely a subsonic theory andbegins to give inappropriate results at values of M ∞=0.7 and above. Consider the subsonic, compressible, inviscid ﬂow over the airfoil sketched in Figure 11.3. The shape of the airfoil is given by y=f(x). Assume that the airfoil is thin and that the angle of attack is small; in such a case, the ﬂow isreasonably approximated by Equation (11.18). Deﬁne β 2≡1−M2 ∞ so that Equation (11.18) can be written as β2∂2ˆφ ∂x2+∂2ˆφ ∂y2=0 (11.35) Let us transform the independent variables xandyinto a new space, ξandη, such that ξ=x (11.36a) η=βy (11.36b) Moreover, in this transformed space, consider a new velocity potential ¯φsuch that ¯φ(ξ, η) =βˆφ(x,y) (11.36c) To recast Equation (11.35) in terms of the transformed variables, recall the chainrule of partial differentiation; that is, ∂ˆφ ∂x=∂ˆφ ∂ξ∂ξ ∂x+∂ˆφ ∂η∂η ∂x(11.37)752 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow and∂ˆφ ∂y=∂ˆφ ∂ξ∂ξ ∂y+∂ˆφ ∂η∂η ∂y(11.38) From Equations (11.36 aandb), we have ∂ξ ∂x=1∂ξ ∂y=0∂η ∂x=0∂η ∂y=β Hence, Equations (11.37) and (11.38) become ∂ˆφ ∂x=∂ˆφ ∂ξ(11.39) ∂ˆφ ∂y=β∂ˆφ ∂η(11.40) Recalling Equation (11.36c ), Equations (11.39) and (11.40) become ∂ˆφ ∂x=1 β∂¯φ ∂ξ(11.41) and ∂ˆφ ∂y=∂¯φ ∂η(11.42) Differentiating Equation (11.41) with respect to x(again using the chain rule), we obtain ∂2ˆφ ∂x2=1 β∂2¯φ ∂ξ2(11.43) Differentiating Equation (11.42) with respect to y, we ﬁnd that the result is ∂2ˆφ ∂y2=β∂2¯φ ∂η2(11.44) Substitute Equations (11.43) and (11.44) into (11.35): β21 β∂2¯φ ∂ξ2+β∂2¯φ ∂η2=0 or∂2¯φ ∂ξ2+∂2¯φ ∂η2=0 (11.45) Examine Equation (11.45)—it should look familiar. Indeed, Equation (11.45) is Laplace’s equation. Recall from Chapter 3 that Laplace’s equation is the gov-erning relation for incompressible ﬂow. Hence, starting with a subsonic com- pressible ﬂow in physical (x,y)space where the ﬂow is represented by ˆφ(x,y) obtained from Equation (11.35), we have related this ﬂow to an incompressibleCHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 753 ﬂow in transformed (ξ, η) space, where the ﬂow is represented by ¯φ(ξ, η) ob- tained from Equation (11.45). The relation between ¯φand ˆφis given by Equa- tion (11.36c ). Consider again the shape of the airfoil given in physical space by y=f(x). The shape of the airfoil in the transformed space is expressed as η=q(ξ). Let us compare the two shapes. First, apply the approximate boundary condition, Equation (11.34), in physical space, noting that df/dx=tanθ. We obtain V∞df dx=∂ˆφ ∂y=1 β∂¯φ ∂y=∂¯φ ∂η(11.46) Similarly, apply the ﬂow-tangency condition in transformed space, which fromEquation (11.34) is V ∞dq dξ=∂¯φ ∂η(11.47) Examine Equations (11.46) and (11.47) closely. Note that the right-hand sides ofthese two equations are identical. Thus, from the left-hand sides, we obtain df dx=dq dξ(11.48) Equation (11.48) implies that the shape of the airfoil in the transformed space isthe same as in the physical space. Hence, the above transformation relates thecompressible ﬂow over an airfoil in (x,y)space to the incompressible ﬂow in (ξ, η) space over the same airfoil. The above theory leads to an immensely practical result, as follows. Recall Equation (11.32) for the linearized pressure coefﬁcient. Inserting the above trans-formation into Equation (11.32), we obtain C p=−2ˆu V∞=−2 V∞∂ˆφ ∂x=−2 V∞1 β∂¯φ ∂x=−2 V∞1 β∂¯φ ∂ξ(11.49) Question: What is the signiﬁcance of ∂¯φ/∂ξ in Equation (11.49)? Recall that ¯φ is the perturbation velocity potential for an incompressible ﬂow in transformedspace. Hence, from the deﬁnition of velocity potential, ∂¯φ/∂ξ =¯u, where ¯uis a perturbation velocity for the incompressible ﬂow. Hence, Equation (11.49) canbe written as C p=1 β/parenleftbigg −2¯u V∞/parenrightbigg (11.50) From Equation (11.32), the expression (−2¯u/V∞)is simply the linearized pres- sure coefﬁcient for the incompressible ﬂow. Denote this incompressible pressurecoefﬁcient by C p,0. Hence, Equation (11.50) gives Cp=Cp,0 β754 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow or recalling that β≡/radicalbig 1−M2 ∞, we have Cp=Cp,0/radicalbig 1−M2 ∞(11.51) Equation (11.51) is called the Prandtl-Glauert rule; it states that, if we know the incompressible pressure distribution over an airfoil, then the compressible pres- sure distribution over the same airfoil can be obtained from Equation (11.51).Therefore, Equation (11.51) is truly a compressibility correction to incompress- ible data. Consider the lift and moment coefﬁcients for the airfoil. For an inviscid ﬂow, the aerodynamic lift and moment on a body are simply integrals of the pressuredistribution over the body, as described in Section 1.5. (If this is somewhat foggyin your mind, review Section 1.5 before progressing further.) In turn, the lift andmoment coefﬁcients are obtained from the integral of the pressure coefﬁcient via Equations (1.15) to (1.19). Since Equation (11.51) relates the compressible andincompressible pressure coefﬁcients, the same relation must therefore hold forlift and moment coefﬁcients: cl=cl,0/radicalbig 1−M2 ∞ cm=cm,0/radicalbig 1−M2 ∞[11.52] [11.53] The Prandtl-Glauert rule, embodied in Equations (11.51) to (11.53), was historically the ﬁrst compressibility correction to be obtained. As early as 1922, Prandtl was using this result in his lectures at G¨ ottingen, although without writtenproof. The derivation of Equations (11.51) to (11.53) was ﬁrst formally publishedby the British aerodynamicist, Hermann Glauert, in 1928. Hence, the rule isnamed after both men. The Prandtl-Glauert rule was used exclusively until 1939,when an improved compressibility correction was developed. Because of theirsimplicity, Equations (11.51) to (11.53) are still used today for initial estimatesof compressibility effects. Recall that the results of Chapters 3 and 4 proved that inviscid, incompressible ﬂow over a closed, two-dimensional body theoretically produces zero drag—thewell-known d’Alembert’s paradox. Does the same paradox hold for inviscid,subsonic, compressible ﬂow? The answer can be obtained by again noting thatthe only source of drag is the integral of the pressure distribution. If this integral iszero for an incompressible ﬂow, and since the compressible pressure coefﬁcientdiffers from the incompressible pressure coefﬁcient by only a constant scale factor,β, then the integral must also be zero for a compressible ﬂow. Hence, d’Alembert’s paradox also prevails for inviscid, subsonic, compressible ﬂow. However, as soonas the freestream Mach number is high enough to produce locally supersonic ﬂowCHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 755 on the body surface with attendant shock waves, as shown in Figure 1.43b , then a positive wave drag is produced, and d’Alembert’s paradox no longer prevails. EXAMPLE 11.1 At a given point on the surface of an airfoil, the pressure coefﬁcient is −0.3 at very low speeds. If the freestream Mach number is 0.6, calculate Cpat this point. ■Solution From Equation (11.51), Cp=Cp,0√ 1−M2=−0.3/radicalbig 1−(0.6)2=−0.375 EXAMPLE 11.2 From Chapter 4, the theoretical lift coefﬁcient for a thin, symmetric airfoil in an incom- pressible ﬂow is cl=2πα.

Efforts were madeto improve upon the Prandtl-Glauert rule discussed in Section 11.4. Several ofthe more popular formulas are given below.

The experimental data are chosen for their historicalsigniﬁcance; from Stack, John, W. F. Lindsey, andR. E. Littell: The Compressibility Burble and the Effect of Compressibility on Pressures and ForcesActing on an Airfoil, NACA report no. 646, 1938.This was the ﬁrst major NACA publication toaddress the compressibility problem in a systematicfashion; it covered work performed in the 2-fthigh-speed tunnel at the Langley AeronauticalLaboratory and was carried out during 1935–1936. These compressibility corrections are compared in Figure 11.4, which also shows experimental data for the Cpvariation with M∞at the 0.3-chord location on an NACA 4412 airfoil. Note that the Prandtl-Glauert rule, although the simplest to apply, underpredicts the experimental data, whereas the improved compressibilitycorrections are clearly more accurate. Recall that the Prandtl-Glauert rule is basedon linear theory. In contrast, both the Laitone and Karman-Tsien rules attempt toaccount for some of the nonlinear aspects of the ﬂow. 11.6 CRITICAL MACH NUMBER Return to the road map given in Figure 11.1. We have now ﬁnished our discus-sion of linearized ﬂow and the associated compressibility corrections. Keep inmind that such linearized theory does notapply to the transonic ﬂow regime,CHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 757 M/H11009 = 0.3Local MA = 0.435 A (a) M/H11009 = 0.5Local MA = 0.772 A (b) Sonic line where M = 1M/H11009 = Mcr = 0.61Local MA = 1.0 A (c) M/H11009 = 0.65 > Mcr M > 1 (d) Figure 11.5 Deﬁnition of critical Mach number. Point Ais the location of minimum pressure on the top surface of the airfoil. (See end-of-chapter Problem 11.7 for the calculationof the numbers in this ﬁgure.) 0.8≤M∞≤1.2. Transonic ﬂow is highly nonlinear, and theoretical transonic aerodynamics is a challenging and sophisticated subject. For the remainder of this chapter, we deal with several aspects of transonic ﬂow from a qualitative point ofview. The theory of transonic aerodynamics is beyond the scope of this book. Consider an airfoil in a low-speed ﬂow, say, with M ∞=0.3, as sketched in Figure 11.5 a. In the expansion over the top surface of the airfoil, the local ﬂow Mach number Mincreases. Let point Arepresent the location on the airfoil surface where the pressure is a minimum, hence where Mis a maximum. In Fig- ure 11.5 a, let us say this maximum is MA=0.435. Now assume that we gradually increase the freestream Mach number. As M∞increases, MAalso increases. For example, if M∞is increased to M=0.5, the maximum local value of Mwill be 0.772, as shown in Figure 11.5b . Let us continue to increase M∞until we achieve just the right value such that the local Mach number at the minimum pressurepoint equals 1, that is, such that M A=1.0, as shown in Figure 11.5c . When this happens, the freestream Mach number M∞is called the critical Mach number,758 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow denoted by Mcr. By deﬁnition, the critical Mach number is that freestream Mach number at which sonic ﬂow is ﬁrst achieved on the airfoil surface. In Figure 11.5c , Mcr=0.61. One of the most important problems in high-speed aerodynamics is the deter- mination of the critical Mach number of a given airfoil, because at values of M∞ slightly above Mcr, the airfoil experiences a dramatic increase in drag coefﬁcient (discussed in Section 11.7). The purpose of the present section is to give a rather straightforward method for estimating Mcr. Letp∞andpArepresent the static pressures in the freestream and at point A, respectively, in Figure 11.5. For isentropic ﬂow, where the total pressure p0is constant, these static pressures are related through Equation (8.42) as follows: pA p∞=pA/p0 p∞/p0=/parenleftbigg1+[(γ−1)/2] M2 ∞ 1+[(γ−1)/2] M2 A/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) (11.56) The pressure coefﬁcient at point Ais given by Equation (11.22) as Cp,A=2 γM2 ∞/parenleftbiggpA p∞−1/parenrightbigg (11.57) Combining Equations (11.56) and (11.57), we have Cp,A=2 γM2 ∞/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbigg1+[(γ−1)/2] M2 ∞ 1+[(γ−1)/2] M2 A/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) −1/bracketrightBigg (11.58) Equation (11.58) is useful in its own right; for a given freestream Mach number, itrelates the local value of C pto the local Mach number. [Note that Equation (11.58) is the compressible ﬂow analogue of Bernoulli’s equation, Equation (3.13), whichfor incompressible ﬂow with a given freestream velocity and pressure relates thelocal pressure at a point in the ﬂow to the local velocity at that point.] However,for our purposes here, we ask the question, What is the value of the local C p when the local Mach number is unity? By deﬁnition, this value of the pressurecoefﬁcient is called the critical pressure coefﬁcient, denoted by C p,cr. For a given freestream Mach number M∞, the value of Cp,crcan be obtained by inserting MA=1 into Equation (11.58): Cp,cr=2 γM2 ∞/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbigg1+[(γ−1)/2] M2 ∞ 1+(γ−1)/2/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) −1/bracketrightBigg (11.59) Equation (11.59) allows us to calculate the pressure coefﬁcient at any point inthe ﬂow where the local Mach number is 1, for a given freestream Mach number M ∞. For example, if M∞is slightly greater than Mcr, say, M∞=0.65 as shown in Figure 11.5d , then a ﬁnite region of supersonic ﬂow will exist above the airfoil; Equation (11.59) allows us to calculate the pressure coefﬁcient at only those pointswhere M=1, that is, at only those points that fall on the sonic line in Figure 11.5d . Now, returning to Figure 11.5c , when the freestream Mach number is precisely equal to the critical Mach number, there is only one point where M=1, namely,CHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 759 0 0.2 0.4 McrM/H11009 0.6 0.8Eq.

The pressure coefﬁcient at point Awill be Cp,cr, which is obtained from Equation (11.59). In this case, M∞in Equation (11.59) is precisely Mcr. Hence, Cp,cr=2 γM2 cr/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbigg1+[(γ−1)/2] M2 cr 1+(γ−1)/2/parenrightbiggγ/(γ−1) −1/bracketrightBigg (11.60) Equation (11.60) shows that Cp,cris a unique function of Mcr; this variation is plotted as curve Cin Figure 11.6. Note that Equation (11.60) is simply an aerodynamic relation for isentropic ﬂow—it has no connection with the shape of a given airfoil. In this sense, Equation (11.60), and hence curve Cin Figure 11.6, is a type of “universal relation” which can be used for all airfoils. Equation (11.60), in conjunction with any one of the compressibility correc- tions given by Equation (11.51), (11.54), or (11.55), allows us to estimate thecritical Mach number for a given airfoil as follows: 1.By some means, either experimental or theoretical, obtain the low-speed incompressible value of the pressure coefﬁcient C p,0at the minimum pressure point on the given airfoil. 2.Using any of the compressibility corrections, Equation (11.51), (11.54), or(11.55), plot the variation of C pwith M∞. This is represented by curve B in Figure 11.6. 3.Somewhere on curve B, there will be a single point where the pressure coefﬁcient corresponds to locally sonic ﬂow. Indeed, this point mustcoincide with Equation (11.60), represented by curve Cin Figure 11.6. Hence, the intersection of curves BandCrepresents the point corresponding to sonic ﬂow at the minimum pressure location on the airfoil.In turn, the value of M ∞at this intersection is, by deﬁnition, the critical Mach number, as shown in Figure 11.6.760 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow M/H11009Thin airfoilThick Cp0 Thin Cp0 0Thick airfoilCp Cp, cr = f(Mcr)(–) (Mcr)thick(Mcr)thinThin airfoil Thick airfoil Figure 11.7 Effect of airfoil thickness on critical Mach number. The graphical construction in Figure 11.6 is not an exact determination of Mcr. Although curve Cis exact, curve Bis approximate because it represents the approximate compressibility correction. Hence, Figure 11.6 gives only an estimation of Mcr. However, such an estimation is quite useful for prelimi- nary design, and the results from Figure 11.6 are accurate enough for mostapplications. Consider two airfoils, one thin and the other thick, as sketched in Figure 11.7. First consider the low-speed incompressible ﬂow over these airfoils. The ﬂow overthe thin airfoil is only slightly perturbed from the freestream. Hence, the expan-sion over the top surface is mild, and C p,0at the minimum pressure point is a negative number of only small absolute magnitude, as shown in Figure 11.7.[Recall from Equation (11.32) that C p∝ˆu; hence, the smaller the perturba- tion, the smaller is the absolute magnitude of Cp.] In contrast, the ﬂow over the thick airfoil experiences a large perturbation from the freestream. The expansionover the top surface is strong, and C p,0at the minimum pressure point is a neg- ative number of large magnitude, as shown in Figure 11.7. If we now performfor each airfoil the same construction as given in Figure 11.6, we see that thethick airfoil will have a lower critical Mach number than the thin airfoil. Thisis clearly illustrated in Figure 11.7. For high-speed airplanes, it is desirable tohave M cras high as possible. Hence, modern high-speed subsonic airplanes are usually designed with relatively thin airfoils. (The development of the supercrit-ical airfoil has somewhat loosened this criterion, as discussed in Section 11.8.)For example, the Gates Lear jet high-speed jet executive transport utilizes a9 percent thick airfoil; contrast this with the low-speed Piper Aztec, a twin-engine propeller-driven general aviation aircraft designed with a 14 percent thickairfoil.CHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 761 EXAMPLE 11.3 In this example, we illustrate the estimation of the critical Mach number for an airfoil using (a) the graphical solution discussed in this section, and (b ) an analytical solution using a closed-form equation obtained from a combination of Equations (11.51) and (11.60).Consider the NACA 0012 airfoil at zero angle of attack shown at the top of Figure 11.8.The pressure coefﬁcient distribution over this airfoil, measured in a wind tunnel at lowspeed, is given at the bottom of Figure 11.8.

Note that Cp,cr=0 when Mcr=1.0. This makes physical sense; if the free stream Mach number is already 1, then no change in the pressure is required to achieve Mach 1 at a local point in the ﬂow, and hence thepressure difference (p cr−p∞)is zero and Cp,cr=0.

Since Mcrappears in a complicated fashion on both sides of Equation (11.63), we solve the equation by trial-and-error by assuming different values of Mcr, calculating the values of both sides of Equation (11.63), and iterating until we ﬁnd a value of Mcrthat results in both the right and left sides being the same value.

Therefore, the analytical solution yields Mcr=0.7371 Note: Within the two-place accuracy of the graphical solution in part (a), both the graphical and analytical solutions give the same value of Mcr. Question: How accurate is the estimate of the critical Mach number in this example? To answer this question, we examine some experimental pressure coefﬁcient distributionsfor the NACA 0012 airfoil obtained at higher freestream Mach numbers. Wind tunnelmeasurements of the surface pressure distributions for this airfoil at zero angle of attackin a high-speed ﬂow are shown in Figure 11.10; for Figure 11.10 a,M ∞=0.575, and for Figure 11.10b ,M∞=0.725. In Figure 11.10 a, the value of Cp,cr=− 1.465 at M∞=0.575 is shown as the dashed horizontal line.

Clearly from the measured surface pressure coefﬁcient distribution at M∞=0.575 shown in Figure 11.10 a, the ﬂow is locally subsonic at every point on the surface. Hence, M∞=0.575 is below the critical Mach number. In Figure 11.10b , which is for a higher Mach number, the value of Cp,cr=− 0.681 at M∞=0.725 isCHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 765 shown as the dashed horizontal line. Here, the local pressure coefﬁcient on the airfoil is higher than Cp,crat every point on the surface except at the point of minimum pressure, where (Cp)minis essentially equal to Cp,cr. This means that for M∞=0.725, the ﬂow is locally subsonic at every point on the surface except the point of minimum pressure, where the ﬂow is essentially sonic. Hence, these experimental measurements indicate that thecritical Mach number of the NACA 0012 airfoil at zero angle of attack is approximately0.73. Comparing this experimental result with the calculated value of M cr=0.74 in this example, we see that our calculations are amazingly accurate, to within about one percent. 11.6.1 A Comment on the Location of Minimum Pressure (Maximum Velocity) Examining the shape of the NACA 0012 airfoil shown at the top of Figure 11.8, note that the maximum thickness occurs at x/c=0.3. However, examining the pressure coefﬁcient distribution shown at the bottom of Figure 11.8, note that thepoint of minimum pressure occurs on the surface at x/c=0.11, considerably ahead of the point of maximum thickness. This is a graphic illustration of thegeneral fact that the point of minimum pressure (hence maximum velocity) doesnotcorrespond to the location of maximum thickness of the airfoil. Intuition might at ﬁrst suggest that, at least for a symmetric airfoil at zero degrees angle of attack,the location of minimum pressure (maximum velocity) on the surface might beat the maximum thickness of the airfoil, but our intuition would be completelywrong. Nature places the maximum velocity at a point which satisﬁes the physicsof the whole ﬂow ﬁeld, not just what is happening in a local region of the ﬂow. The point of maximum velocity is dictated by the complete shape of the airfoil, not just by the shape in a local region. We also note that it is implicit in the approximate compressibility corrections discussed in Sections 11.4 and 11.5, and their use for the estimation of the criticalMach number as discussed in Section 11.6, that the point of minimum pressureremains at a ﬁxed location on the body surface as M ∞is increased from a very low to a high subsonic value. This is indeed approximately the case. Examine theexperimental pressure distributions in Figures 11.8 and 11.10, which are for threedifferent Mach numbers ranging from a low, incompressible value (Figure 11.8)toM ∞=0.725 (Figure 11.10b ). Note that in each case the minimum pressure point is at the same approximate location, that is, at x/c=0.11. 11.7 DRAG-DIVERGENCE MACH NUMBER: THE SOUND BARRIER Imagine that we have a given airfoil at a ﬁxed angle of attack in a wind tunnel,and we wish to measure its drag coefﬁcient c das a function of M∞. To begin with, we measure the drag coefﬁcient at low subsonic speed to be cd,0, shown in Figure 11.11. Now, as we gradually increase the freestream Mach number, weobserve that c dremains relatively constant all the way to the critical Mach number, as illustrated in Figure 11.11. The ﬂow ﬁelds associated with points a,b, and cin Figure 11.11 are represented by Figure 11.5 a,b, and c, respectively. As we very766 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow M > 1 M > 1 cd0 Mcr Mdrag-divergence1.0 0Sound barriercd g h f e dc b aM/H11009 M/H11009 Figure 11.11 Sketch of the variation of proﬁle drag coefﬁcient with freestream Mach number, illustrating the critical and drag-divergence Mach numbers and showing the large drag rise near Mach 1. carefully increase M∞slightly above Mcr, say, to point din Figure 11.11, a ﬁnite region of supersonic ﬂow appears on the airfoil, as shown in Figure 11.5d . The Mach number in this bubble of supersonic ﬂow is only slightly above Mach 1, typically 1.02 to 1.05. However, as we continue to nudge M∞higher, we encounter a point where the drag coefﬁcient suddenly starts to increase. This is given as pointein Figure 11.11. The value of M ∞at which this sudden increase in drag starts is deﬁned as the drag-divergence Mach number. Beyond the drag-divergence Mach number, the drag coefﬁcient can become very large, typically increasing by afactor of 10 or more. This large increase in drag is associated with an extensiveregion of supersonic ﬂow over the airfoil, terminating in a shock wave, as sketchedin the insert in Figure 11.11. Corresponding to point fon the drag curve, this insert shows that as M ∞approaches unity, the ﬂow on both the top and bottom surfaces can be supersonic, both terminated by shock waves. For example, consider thecase of a reasonably thick airfoil, designed originally for low-speed applications,when M ∞is beyond drag-divergence; in such a case, the local Mach number can reach 1.2 or higher. As a result, the terminating shock waves can be relativelystrong. These shocks generally cause severe ﬂow separation downstream of theshocks, with an attendant large increase in drag. Now, put yourself in the place of an aeronautical engineer in 1936. You are familiar with the Prandtl-Glauert rule, given by Equation (11.51). You recognizethat as M ∞→1, this equation shows the absolute magnitude of CpapproachingCHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 767 Figure 11.12 The Bell XS-1—the ﬁrst manned airplane to ﬂy faster than sound, October 14, (NASA). inﬁnity. This hints at some real problems near Mach 1. Furthermore, you know of some initial high-speed subsonic wind-tunnel tests that have generated dragcurves that resemble the portion of Figure 11.11 from points atof. How far will the drag coefﬁcient increase as we get closer to M ∞=1? Will cdgo to inﬁnity? At this stage, you might be pessimistic. You might visualize the drag increaseto be so large that no airplane with the power plants existing in 1936, or evenenvisaged for the future, could ever overcome this “barrier.” It was this type ofthought that led to the popular concept of a sound barrier and that prompted manypeople to claim that humans would never ﬂy faster than the speed of sound. Of course, today we know the sound barrier was a myth. We cannot use the Prandtl-Glauert rule to argue that c dwill become inﬁnite at M∞=1, because the Prandtl-Glauert rule is invalid at M∞=1 (see Sections 11.3 and 11.4). Moreover, early transonic wind-tunnel tests carried out in the late 1940s clearly indicatedthatc dpeaks at or around Mach 1 and then actually decreases as we enter the supersonic regime, as shown by points gandhin Figure 11.11. All we need is an aircraft with an engine powerful enough to overcome the large drag rise atMach 1. The myth of the sound barrier was ﬁnally put to rest on October 14,1947, when Captain Charles (Chuck) Yeager became the ﬁrst human being toﬂy faster than sound in the sleek, bullet-shaped Bell XS-1. This rocket-propelledresearch aircraft is shown in Figure 11.12. Of course, today supersonic ﬂight is768 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow a common reality; we have jet engines powerful enough to accelerate military ﬁghters through Mach 1 ﬂying straight up! Such airplanes can ﬂy at Mach 3 andbeyond. Indeed, we are limited only by aerodynamic heating at high speeds (andthe consequent structural problems). Right now, NASA is conducting researchon supersonic combustion ramjet engines for ﬂight at Mach 5 and higher (seethe Design Box at the end of Section 9.6). Keep in mind, however, that becauseof the large power requirements for very high-speed ﬂight, the fuel consumptionbecomes large. In today’s energy-conscious world, this constraint can be as mucha barrier to high-speed ﬂight as the sound barrier was once envisaged. Since 1945, research in transonic aerodynamics has focused on reducing the large drag rise shown in Figure 11.11. Instead of living with a factor of 10 increasein drag at Mach 1, can we reduce it to a factor of 2 or 3? This is the subject of theremaining sections of this chapter. DESIGN BOX In order to cope with the large drag rise near Mach 1, as seen in Figure 11.11, the designers of high-speedairplanes after World War II utilized two aerodynamicdesign features to increase the critical Mach number,and hence the drag-divergence Mach number, for suchaircraft. These two features are now classic and arediscussed here. The ﬁrst design ploy was the use of thin airfoil sections on the airplane wing. We have already dis- cussed that, everything else being equal, the thinneris the airfoil the higher is the critical Mach number;this is shown in Figure 11.7. This phenomenon wasobserved as early as 1918 by two research engineers,F. W. Caldwell and E. N. Fales, at the Army’s McCookField in Dayton, Ohio, and was solidly conﬁrmedby various experiments during the 1920s and 1930s.More historical details are given in Section 11.11, andthe detailed story of the early research in the twenti-eth century on compressibility effects is told in Ref-erence 58. Indeed, the Bell X-1 (Figure 11.12) wasdesigned with the full knowledge of the importanceof thin airfoils. As a result, the X-1 was designed withtwo sets of wings, one with a 10 percent thick airfoilfor more routine ﬂights and another with an 8 percentthick airfoil for ﬂights intended to penetrate throughMach 1. The airfoil sections for the two wings wereNACA 65-110 and NACA 65-108, respectively. Thesewings were much thinner than conventional airplanesat that time, which had wing thickness typically of15 percent or higher. Moreover, the horizontal tail waseven thinner, utilizing a 6-percent thick NACA 65-006airfoil section. This was done to ensure that when thewing encountered major compressibility effects, thehorizontal tail and elevator would still be free of suchproblems and would be functional for stability andcontrol. However, hedging their bets, the Bell engi-neers also made the tail all-moving, that is, the in-cidence angle of the complete horizontal tail surfacecould be changed in ﬂight in case elevator effective-ness was lost, and to help trim the airplane as it ﬂewthrough Mach 1. Chuck Yeager made good use ofthis all-moving tail feature during his history-makingﬂights in the X-1. The use of thin airfoils on high-speed aircraft is almost a standard design practice today. The de-sign trend to thin airfoils is illustrated in Figure 11.13,which shows the variation of airfoil thickness for dif-ferent airplanes as a function of their design Machnumber. Clearly, as M ∞increases, the trend is toward thinner wings. The second design ploy was the use of swept wings. The story surrounding the history of the sweptwing concept is told in Reference 58; the invention ofthe concept is shared by two people, the German engi-neer Adolf Busemann in 1935 and the American aero-dynamicist R. T. Jones who independently conceivedCHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 769 0 0.5 1.0 Mach number1.5 2.0 2.5 3.00468101214A-10 S.211 MB 339 Harrier II MIG-21 F-14 F-15 F-16F-1 MitsubishiGnatAlpha JetStreamwise thickness/chord % SR-71F-86 Hawk Harrier I F-100 F-18 Figure 11.13 Variation of thickness-to-chord ratio with Mach number for a representative sampling of different airplanes.

There are several ways of explain- ing how a swept wing works (e.g., see Reference 2).However, for our purposes here we will explain thebeneﬁt of a swept wing using the ideas set forthabout thin airfoils, as discussed above. Consider astraight wing, a portion of which is sketched in Fig-ure 11.14 a. We deﬁne a straight wing as one for which the mid-chord line is perpendicular to the freestream;this is certainly the case for the rectangular planformshown in Figure 11.14 a. Assume the straight wing has an airfoil section with a thickness-to-chord ra-tio of 0.15 as shown at the left of Figure 11.14 a. Streamline AB ﬂowing over this wing sees the air-foil with t 1/c1=0.15. Now consider the same wing swept back through the angle /Lambda1=45◦, as shownin Figure 11.14b . Streamline CD that ﬂows over this wing (ignoring any three-dimensional curvature ef-fects) sees an effective airfoil shape with the samethickness as before (t 2=t1), but the effective chord length c2is longer by a factor of 1.41 (i.e., c2= 1.41c 1). This makes the effective thickness-to-chord ratio seen by streamline CD equal to t2/c2=0.106— thinner by almost one-third compared to the straight-wing case. Hence, by sweeping the wing, the ﬂowbehaves as if the airfoil section is thinner, with a con-sequent increase in the critical Mach number of thewing. Everything else being equal, a swept wing hasa larger critical Mach number, hence a larger drag-divergence Mach number than a straightwing. For thisreason, most high-speed airplanes designed since the770 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow A B (a) (b)Segment of straight wing c1t1t1 c1= 0.15 C/H9024 = 45/H11034 DSegment of swept wingc2 = 1.41c1t1 = t2t2 c2= 0.106 Figure 11.14 By sweeping the wing, a streamline effectively sees a thinner airfoil.CHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 771 middle 1940s have swept wings. (The only reason why the Bell X-1, shown in Figure 11.12, had straightwings is because its design commenced in 1944 beforeany knowledge or data about swept wings was avail-able in the United States. Later, when such swept-wingdata ﬂooded into the United States from Germanyin mid-1945, the Bell designers were conservative,and stuck with the straight wing.) A wonderful ex-ample of an early swept-wing ﬁghter is the NorthAmerican F-86 of Korean War vintage, shown inFigure 11.15. Finally, we note some compressibility correc- tions that apply to Equations (5.69), (5.81), and (5.82)given earlier for the estimation of the lift slope for highaspect ratio straight wings, low aspect ratio straightwings, and swept wings respectively. These equationsapply to low-speed, incompressible ﬂow. The Prandtl-Glauert rule for an airfoil section expressed in terms ofpressure coefﬁcient as given by Equation (11.51) alsoholds for the lift slope for the airfoil. Letting a 0be the lift slope for an inﬁnite wing for incompressible ﬂow,anda 0,comp be the lift slope for an inﬁnite wing in a subsonic compressible ﬂow, from the Prandtl-Glauertrule we have a 0,comp =a0/radicalbig 1−M2∞(11.64) We assume that Equation (5.70) relating the lift slopeof a ﬁnite wing to that for an inﬁnite wing, as obtainedfrom Prandtl’s lifting line theory, holds for subsoniccompressible ﬂow as well. Letting the term (1+τ) −1 in Equation (5.70) be replaced by a span efﬁciency fac-tor for lift slope denoted by e 1, where e1=(1+τ)−1, and denoting the compressible lift slope for the ﬁnitewing by a comp, the compressible analogue of Equa- tion (5.70) is acomp=a0,comp 1+a0,comp/(πe1AR)(11.65)Substituting Equation (11.64) into Equation (11.65),and simplifying, we obtain acomp=a0/radicalbig 1−M2∞+a0/(πe1AR)(11.66) Equation (11.66) is an equation for estimating the liftslope for a high-aspect-ratio straight wing in a com- pressible ﬂow with a subsonic M ∞from the known lift slope for an inﬁnite wing in an incompressible ﬂow a0.

One of these—the area rule—is discussed in this section; theother—the supercritical airfoil—is the subject of Section 11.9. For a moment, let us expand our discussion from two-dimensional airfoils to a consideration of a complete airplane. In this section, we introduce a designconcept that has effectively reduced the drag rise near Mach 1 for a completeairplane. As stated before, the ﬁrst practical jet-powered aircraft appeared at the end of World War II in the form of the German Me 262. This was a subsonic ﬁghter planewith a top speed near 550 mi/h. The next decade saw the design and productionof many types of jet aircraft—all limited to subsonic ﬂight by the large drag nearMach 1. Even the “century” series of ﬁghter aircraft designed to give the U.S.Air Force supersonic capability in the early 1950s, such as the Convair F-102delta-wing airplane, ran into difﬁculty and could not at ﬁrst readily penetrate thesound barrier in level ﬂight. The thrust of jet engines at that time simply couldnot overcome the large peak drag near Mach 1. A planview, cross section, and area distribution (cross-sectional area versus distance along the axis of the airplane) for a typical airplane of that decade aresketched in Figure 11.16. Let Adenote the total cross-sectional area at any given station. Note that the cross-sectional area distribution experiences some abrupt xxB B A(x)Planview Area distribution (schematic only)Cross section BB, with cross-sectionalarea A = f (x) Figure 11.16 A schematic of a non-area-ruled aircraft.774 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow x Planview xA(x) Area distribution (schematic only) Figure 11.17 A schematic of an area-ruled aircraft. changes along the axis, with discontinuities in both AanddA/dxin the regions of the wing. In contrast, for almost a century, it was well known by ballisticians that the speed of a supersonic bullet or artillery shell with a smooth variation of cross-sectional area was higher than projectiles with abrupt or discontinuous area distributions. In the mid-1950s, an aeronautical engineer at the NACA LangleyAeronautical Laboratory, Richard T. Whitcomb, put this knowledge to work onthe problem of transonic ﬂight of airplanes. Whitcomb reasoned that the variationof cross-sectional area for an airplane should be smooth, with no discontinuities.This meant that, in the region of the wings and tail, the fuselage cross-sectionalarea should decrease to compensate for the addition of the wing and tail cross-sectional area. This led to a “coke bottle” fuselage shape, as shown in Figure 11.17.Here, the planview and area distribution are shown for an aircraft with a relativelysmooth variation of A(x). This design philosophy is called the area rule, and it successfully reduced the peak drag near Mach 1 such that practical airplanescould ﬂy supersonically by the mid-1950s. The variations of drag coefﬁcient with M ∞for an area-ruled and non-area-ruled airplane are schematically compared in Figure 11.18; typically, the area rule leads to a factor-of-2 reduction in the peakdrag near Mach 1. The development of the area rule was a dramatic breakthrough in high-speed ﬂight, and it earned a substantial reputation for Richard Whitcomb—a reputationthat was to be later garnished by a similar breakthrough in transonic airfoil design,to be discussed in Section 11.9. The original work on the area rule was presentedby Whitcomb in Reference 30, which should be consulted for more details.CHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 775 M/H11009 0CD With area ruleWithout area rule 1.0 Figure 11.18 The drag-rise properties of area-ruled and non-area-ruled aircraft (schematic only). 11.9 THE SUPERCRITICAL AIRFOIL Let us return to a consideration of two-dimensional airfoils. A natural conclu- sion from the material in Section 11.6, and especially from Figure 11.11, is thatan airfoil with a high critical Mach number is very desirable, indeed necessary,for high-speed subsonic aircraft. If we can increase M cr, then we can increase Mdrag-divergence , which follows closely after Mcr. This was the philosophy em- ployed in aircraft design from 1945 to approximately 1965. Almost by accident,the NACA 64-series airfoils (see Section 4.2), although originally designed to en-courage laminar ﬂow, turned out to have relative high values of M crin comparison with other NACA shapes. Hence, the NACA 64 series has seen wide applicationon high-speed airplanes. Also, we know that thinner airfoils have higher values of M cr(see Figure 11.7); hence, aircraft designers have used relatively thin airfoils on high-speed airplanes. However, there is a limit to how thin a practical airfoil can be. For example, considerations other than aerodynamic inﬂuence the airfoil thickness; the airfoilrequires a certain thickness for structural strength, and there must be room forthe storage of fuel. This prompts the following question: For an airfoil of giventhickness, how can we delay the large drag rise to higher Mach numbers? Toincrease M cris one obvious tack, as described above, but there is another approach. Rather than increasing Mcr, let us strive to increase the Mach number increment between McrandMdrag-divergence . That is, referring to Figure 11.11, let us increase the distance between points eandc. This philosophy has been pursued since 1965, leading to the design of a new family of airfoils called supercritical airfoils, which are the subject of this section. The purpose of a supercritical airfoil is to increase the value of Mdrag-divergence , although Mcrmay change very little. The shape of a supercritical airfoil is com- pared with an NACA 64-series airfoil in Figure 11.19. Here, an NACA 64 2-A215 airfoil is sketched in Figure 11.19 a, and a 13-percent thick supercritical airfoil is shown in Figure 11.19c . (Note the similarity between the supercritical proﬁle776 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow (–) (+)(a) (b)( d)(c)Relatively strong shock NACA 642–A215 airfoil M/H11009 = 0.69Supercritical airfoil (13.5% thick) M/H11009 = 0.79M > 1 Relatively weak shockM > 1 M > 1 Cp Cp, cr Cp, cr(–) (+)Cp Figure 11.19 Standard NACA 64-series airfoil compared with a supercritical airfoil at cruise lift conditions.

The supercritical airfoil has a relatively ﬂat top, thus encouraging a region of supersonic ﬂow withlower local values of Mthan the NACA 64 series. In turn, the terminating shock is weaker, thus creating less drag. Similar trends can be seen by comparing the C pdistributions for the NACA 64 series (Figure 11.19b ) and the supercritical air- foil (Figure 11.19d ). Indeed, Figure 11.19 aandbfor the NACA 64-series airfoil pertain to a lower freestream Mach number, M∞=0.69, than Figure 11.19c and d, which pertain to the supercritical airfoil at a higher freestream Mach number, M∞=0.79. In spite of the fact that the 64-series airfoil is at a lower M∞, the extent of the supersonic ﬂow reaches farther above the airfoil, the local supersonicMach numbers are higher, and the terminating shock wave is stronger. Clearly, thesupercritical airfoil shows more desirable ﬂow ﬁeld characteristics; namely, theextent of the supersonic ﬂow is closer to the surface, the local supersonic Machnumbers are lower, and the terminating shock wave is weaker. As a result, thevalue of M drag-divergence will be higher for the supercritical airfoil. This is veriﬁed by the experimental data given in Figure 11.20, taken from Reference 31. Here,the value of M drag-divergence is 0.79 for the supercritical airfoil in comparison with 0.67 for the NACA 64 series.CHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 777 0.60 0 0.64 0.68 0.72 0.76 0.800.016 0.012 0.008 0.004NACA 642–A215 Supercritical airfoil (13.5% thick) M/H11009cd Figure 11.20 The drag-divergence properties of a standard NACA 64-series airfoil and a supercritical airfoil. Because the top of the supercritical airfoil is relatively ﬂat, the forward 60 per- cent of the airfoil has negative camber, which lowers the lift. To compensate, the lift is increased by having extreme positive camber on the rearward 30 percentof the airfoil. This is the reason for the cusplike shape of the bottom surface nearthe trailing edge. The supercritical airfoil was developed by Richard Whitcomb in 1965 at the NASA Langley Research Center. A detailed description of the rationale andsome early experimental data for supercritical airfoils are given by Whitcombin Reference 31, which should be consulted for more details. The supercriticalairfoil and many variations of such are now used by the aircraft industry on modernhigh-speed airplane designs. Examples are the Boeing 757 and 767, and the latestmodel Lear jets. The supercritical airfoil is one of two major breakthroughs madein transonic airplane aerodynamics since 1945, the other being the area rulediscussed in Section 11.8. It is a testimonial to the man that Richard Whitcombwas mainly responsible for both. 11.10 CFD APPLICATIONS: TRANSONIC AIRFOILS AND WINGS The analysis of subsonic compressible ﬂow over airfoils discussed in this chapter,resulting in classic compressibility corrections such as the Prandtl-Glauert rule(Section 11.4), ﬁts into the category of “closed-form” theory as discussed inSection 2.17.1. Although this theory is elegant and useful, it is restricted to: 1.Thin airfoils at small angles of attack 2.Subsonic numbers that do not approach too close to one, that is, Mach numbers typically below 0.7 3.Inviscid, irrotational ﬂow However, modern subsonic transports (Boeing 747, 777, etc.) cruise at freestreamMach numbers on the order of 0.85, and high-performance military combat778 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow airplanes spend time at high subsonic speeds near Mach one. These airplanes are in the transonic ﬂight regime, as discussed in Section 1.10.4 and noted in Figure 1.44. The closed-form theory discussed in this chapter does not applyin this ﬂight regime. The only approach that allows the accurate calculation ofairfoil and wing characteristics at transonic speeds is to use computational ﬂuiddynamics; the basic philosophy of CFD is discussed in Section 2.17.2, whichshould be reviewed before you progress further. The need to calculate accurately the transonic ﬂow over airfoils and wings was one of the two areas that drove advances in CFD in the early days of itsdevelopment, the other area being hypersonic ﬂow. The growing importance ofhigh-speed jet civil transports during the 1960s and 1970s made the accuratecalculation of transonic ﬂow imperative, and CFD was (and still is) the only wayof making such calculations. In this section we will give only the ﬂavor of suchcalculations; see Chapter 14 of Reference 21 for more details, as well as themodern aerodynamic literature for the latest developments. Beginning in the 1960s, transonic CFD calculations historically evolved through four distinct steps, as follows: 1.The earliest calculations numerically solved the nonlinear small-perturbation potential equation for transonic ﬂow, obtained fromEquation (11.6) by dropping all terms on the right-hand side except for theleading term, which is not small near M ∞=1. This yields /parenleftbig1−M2 ∞/parenrightbig∂ˆu ∂x+∂ˆv ∂y=M2 ∞/bracketleftbigg (γ+1)ˆu V∞/bracketrightbigg∂ˆu ∂x which in terms of the perturbation velocity potential is /parenleftbig1−M2 ∞/parenrightbig∂2ˆφ ∂x2+∂2ˆφ ∂y2=M2 ∞/bracketleftBigg (γ+1)∂ˆφ ∂x1 V∞/bracketrightBigg ∂2ˆφ ∂x2(11.69) Equation (11.69) is the transonic small perturbation potential equation; it isnon-linear due to the term on the right-hand side, which involves a productof derivatives of the dependent variable ˆφ. This necessitated a numerical CFD solution. However, the results were limited to the assumptionsembodied in this equation, namely, small perturbations and hence thinairfoils at small angles of attack. 2.The next step was numerical solutions of the full potential equation,Equation (11.12). This allowed applications to airfoils of any shape at anyangle of attack. However, the ﬂow was still assumed to be isentropic, andeven though shock waves appeared in the results, the properties of theseshocks were not always accurately predicted. 3.As CFD algorithms became more sophisticated, numerical solutions of theEuler equations [the full continuity, momentum, and energy equations forinviscid ﬂow, such as Equations (7.40), (7.42), and (7.44)] were obtained.The advantage of these Euler solutions was that shock waves were properlytreated. However, none of the approaches discussed in steps 1–3 accountedCHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 779 for the effects of viscous ﬂow, the importance of which in transonic ﬂows soon became more appreciated because of the interaction of the shock wavewith the boundary layer. This interaction, with the attendant ﬂowseparation, is dominant in the prediction of drag. 4.This led to the CFD solution of the viscous ﬂow equations [the Navier–Stokes equations, such as Equations (2.43), (2.61), and (2.87) with theviscous terms included] for transonic ﬂow. The Navier–Stokes equationsare developed in detail in Chapter 15. Such CFD solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations are currently the state of the art in transonic ﬂowcalculations. These solutions contain all of the realistic physics of suchﬂows, with the exception that some type of turbulence model must beincluded to deal with turbulent boundary layers, and such turbulent modelsare frequently the Achilles heel of these calculations. An example of a CFD calculation for the transonic ﬂow over an NACA 0012 airfoil at 2 ◦angle of attack with M∞=0.8 is shown in Figure 11.21. The contour lines shown here are lines of constant Mach number, and the bunching of these lines together clearly shows the nearly normal shock wave occurring on the topsurface. In reference to our calculation in Example 11.3 showing that the criticalMach number for the NACA 0012 airfoil at zero angle of attack is 0.74, and theexperimental conﬁrmation of this shown in Figure 11.10b , clearly the ﬂow over the same airfoil shown in Figure 11.21 is well beyond the critical Mach number.Indeed, the boundary layer downstream of the shock wave in Figure 11.21 isseparated, and the airfoil is squarely in the drag-divergence region. The CFDcalculations predict this separated ﬂow because a version of the Navier–Stokesequations (called the thin shear layer approximation) is being numerically solved,taking into account the viscous ﬂow effects. The results shown in Figure 11.21are from the work of Nakahashi and Deiwert at the NASA Ames Research Center(Reference 70); these results are a graphic illustration of the power of CFD appliedto transonic ﬂow. For details on these types of CFD calculations, see the deﬁnitivebooks by Hirsch (Reference 71). Today, CFD is an integral part of modern transonic airfoil and wing design. A recent example of how CFD is combined with modern optimization designtechniques for the design of complete wings for transonic aircraft is shown inFigures 11.22 and 11.23, taken from the survey paper by Jameson (Reference 72).On the left side of Figure 11.22 athe airfoil shape distribution along the semispan of a baseline, initial wing shape at M ∞=0.83 is given, with the computed pressure coefﬁcient distributions shown at the right. The abrupt drop in Cpin these distributions is due to a relatively strong shock wave along the wing. Afterrepeated iterations, the optimized design at the same M ∞=0.83 is shown in Figure 11.22b . Again, the new airfoil shape distribution is shown on the left, and theCpdistribution is given on the right. The new, optimized wing design shown in Figure 11.22b is virtually shock free, as indicated by the smooth Cpdistributions, with a consequent reduction in drag of 7.6 percent. The optimization shown inFigure 11.22 was subject to the constraint of keeping the wing thickness the same.780 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow –0.5 0 0.5 xy 1 1.5–1.0–0.500.51.0 Figure 11.21 Mach number contours in the transonic ﬂow over an NACA 0012 airfoil at M∞=0.8 and at 2◦angle of attack.

Another but similar case of wing design optimization is shown in Figure 11.23. Here, the ﬁnal optimized wing planform shape is shown for M∞=0.86, with the ﬁnal computed pressure contour lines shown on the planform. Straddling the wingplanform on both the left and right of Figure 11.23 are the pressure coefﬁcient plotsat six spanwise stations. The dashed curves show the C pvariations for the initial baseline wing, with the tell-tale oscillations indicating a shock wave, whereas thesolid curves are the ﬁnal C pvariations for the optimized wing, showing smoother variations that are almost shock-free. The results shown in Figures 11.22 and 11.23are reﬂective of multidisciplinary design optimization using CFD for transonicwings.

In particular, Figure 1.6 shows an artist’s conceptionof the blended wing body, a new vehicle concept that promises to create a renais-sance in long distance air transport. The aerodynamics of the blended wing body(BWB) is deeply rooted in the aerodynamic fundamentals discussed in this book,and so we take this opportunity to examine some of the applied aerodynamicsassociated with the BWB. As background, the BWB was the outgrowth of a challenge issued by Den- nis Bushnell to the aircraft industry in 1988. Bushnell, the chief scientist of theNASA Langley Research Center, asked if new, innovative thinking could resultin a commercial jet transport that would provide a quantum leap in efﬁciencyand performance in comparison to the standard tube-fuselage, swept wing air-plane with jet engines pod-mounted under the wings, such as pioneered by theCHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 783 historic Boeing 707 (Figure 1.2). After 50 years, this conﬁguration remains the same for virtually all transport aircraft, as reinforced by Boeing’s latest design,the 787 Dreamliner shown in Figure 2.2. Responding to this challenge, a smallgroup of aerodynamicists at McDonnell Douglas led by Dr. Robert Liebeck con-ceived the blended wing body, one version of which is shown in Figure 11.24. 222/H11032BWB-5-450G 39/H11032-8/H11033 152/H11032 Figure 11.24 Three-view of a blended wing body.784 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow When McDonnell Douglas was absorbed by Boeing, Liebeck continued his work on the BWB funded by NASA. Figure 11.24 shows a conﬁguration obtainedfrom a baseline study of the BWB carried out by Boeing circa 2002. Now aBoeing senior technical fellow, Liebeck continues to spearhead the BWB con-cept at Boeing. The aerodynamics of the blended wing body is a graphic illustration of the application of many of the fundamentals highlighted in this book. For this reason,the blended wing body is chosen for attention in this applied aerodynamics section.We will see that the BWB is an advanced futuristic ﬂight vehicle applying thevery fundamental aerodynamics that is the subject of this book, underscoring thefact that such fundamentals are timeless. To begin with, examining Figure 11.24 shows that the BWB is clearly a ﬂying wing merged with a center body that is also an airfoil shape with a bulletnose. By replacing the conventional tube fuselage with a center body that itself isan efﬁcient lifting surface, the spanwise lift distribution from one wing tip to theother is closer to the ideal elliptical distribution. Our study of the aerodynamics ofﬁnite wings in Chapter 5 underscored that an elliptical lift distribution yields theminimum induced drag. The BWB is designed to preserve such an elliptical liftdistribution, as illustrated in Figure 11.25. Here we see the BWB lift distributionalong with plots of the spanwise airfoil lift coefﬁcient c land the airfoil thickness- to-chord ratio t/c. There is a direct connection between the variations of cland t/c. The center body must be large enough and thick enough to accommodate the passenger and cargo load, which drives the increase of both the airfoil chordlength and t/cfor the center body section. In order to preserve the elliptical lift 0.5Large center body chord Narrow wing chord t/ct/c L clcl 0.4 0.30.2 0.1 0.020% 15% 10% 5%0% Figure 11.25 Typical spanwise distribution of lift L, lift coefﬁcient cl, and thickness-to- chord ratio for the blended wing body.CHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 785 distribution over the center body, the airfoil section of the center body is different from that used for the outer wing panels. It is chosen to have a lower lift coefﬁcientto counterbalance the larger chord length and thus preserve the smooth spanwiseelliptical lift distribution. (Recall that the lift distribution is the variation of theliftforce per unit span, and this lift force is proportional to both the local value ofc land the chord length.) The BWB is a high-speed subsonic airplane intended to ﬂy at the lower end of the transonic ﬂight regime. Hence, major efforts are made to obtain as high a drag-divergence Mach number as possible. Toward that end, the BWB incorporates twodesign features, both of which deal with aerodynamic fundamentals discussed inthis chapter. 1.Supercritical airfoils. The function of a supercritical airfoil is discussed in Section 11.9. The outer portions of the BWB wing incorporate a modern supercritical airfoil section with aft camber, similar to that shown in Figure11.19c. The center body proﬁle is also an airfoil section. In the ﬁrstgeneration of the BWB development, the airfoil shape chosen was a LiebeckLW102A airfoil (Reference 89) point designed for c l=0.25 at a Mach number of 0.7. A side view of the resulting center body proﬁle is shown inFigure 11.26a. The new-generation BWB uses an advanced customizedtransonic airfoil design for the center body proﬁle. Taking into account theconstraints in cross-sectional area required to effectively hold passengers,baggage, and cargo, the new transonic airfoil design dealt with a carefulthree-dimensional contouring of the center body smoothly blending intothe outer wing panels. The resulting center body proﬁle is shown in (a) (b) Figure 11.26 Center body proﬁles: (a) ﬁrst generation; (b) recent generation.786 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 11.26b, giving a cleaner, more streamlined appearance than the original proﬁle in Figure 11.26a, and providing a higher critical Machnumber. Indeed, the new centerbody proﬁle in Figure 11.2b increased the BWB lift-to-drag ratio by 4 percent. 2.Area rule. The notion of the area rule is discussed in Section 11.8. The blended wing body, with its smooth contours and smoothly varying crosssection, is almost naturally area-ruled. Figure 11.27 compares thecross-sectional area distributions as a function of longitudinal coordinatefor the BWB (solid curve) and a conventional subsonic transport, theMD-11 (dashed curve). Clearly, the BWB area distribution is muchsmoother than that of the MD-11, thus exhibiting good area-rule qualities.Liebeck (Reference 90) states that for the BWB “there appears to be noexplicit boundary for increasing the cruise Mach number beyond 0.88.”Indeed, a set of blended wing bodies have been designed for Mach numbersof 0.85, 0.9, 0.93, and 0.95. The role of computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) in the calculation of tran- sonic inviscid ﬂows is discussed in Section 11.10. This discussion is extended in Chapter 20 to CFD solutions for viscous ﬂows via numerical solutions of theNavier-Stokes equations. Computational ﬂuid dynamics is an essential tool inmodern aircraft design, and this is particularly important for the blended wingbody as discussed by Roman et al. (Reference 91) and Liebeck (Reference 92).For example, Figure 11.28 shows the static pressure contours over the top sur-face of the BWB obtained with a Navier-Stokes CFD solution. Shock waves areindicated by regions where the pressure contours cluster together. These resultsshow that the typical transonic shock wave, which is well deﬁned on the outboardwing, becomes smeared into a weaker compression wave on the center body. TheCFD solutions showed that the ﬂow pattern on the center body was relativelyinsensitive to the angle of attack. Also, the results indicated the initiation of ﬂowseparation in the kink region between the outboard wing and the center body.More CFD results are compared in Figure 11.29 with experimental data obtainedon a blended wing body model tested in the National Transonic Facility (NFT) atthe NASA Langley Research Laboratory at almost full-scale Reynolds number.Figure 11.29a gives the variation of drag coefﬁcient C Dwith lift coefﬁcient CL (a portion of the drag polar). Figure 11.29b is a plot of CLversus angle of attack, and Figure 11.29c gives lift coefﬁcient versus moment coefﬁcient. Even though, for proprietary reasons, numbers are not given on the axes of these graphs, themost important conclusion from these comparisons is that CFD results for theBWB agree within 1% with experimental data. In the words of Robert Liebeck(Reference 92), “The remarkable agreement indicated that CFD could be reliablyutilized for the aerodynamic design and analysis.” In summary, we offer this applied aerodynamics section as a clear example of how the understanding of the fundamental aerodynamics presented in this book isso essential to the design of the ﬂight vehicles of the future.

However, these results had lit-tle relevance to the early aerodynamicists of this century, who were strugglingto push aircraft speeds to 150 mi/h during and just after World War I. To thesepeople, ﬂight near the speed of sound was just fantasy. With one exception! World War I airplanes such as the Spad and Nieuport had propeller blades where the tips were moving at near the speed of sound. ByCHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 789 1919, British researchers had already observed the loss in thrust and large increase in blade drag for a propeller with tip speeds up to 1180 ft/s—slightly above thespeed of sound. To examine this effect further, F. W. Caldwell and E. N. Fales,both engineers at the U.S. Army’s Engineering Division at McCook Field nearDayton, Ohio (the forerunner of the massive Air Force research and developmentfacilities at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base today), conducted a series of high-speed airfoil tests. They designed and built the ﬁrst high-speed wind tunnel—afacility with a 14-in-diameter test section capable of velocities up to 675 ft/s. In1918, they conducted the ﬁrst wind-tunnel tests involving the high-speed ﬂowover a stationary airfoil. Their results showed large decreases in lift coefﬁcientand major increases in drag coefﬁcient for the thicker airfoils at angle of attack.These were the ﬁrst measured “compressibility effects” on an airfoil in history.Caldwell and Fales noted that such changes occurred at a certain air velocity,which they denoted as the “critical speed”—a term that was to evolve into thecritical Mach number at a later date. It is interesting to note that Orville Wrightwas a consultant to the Army at this time (Wilbur had died prematurely in 1912of typhoid fever) and observed some of the Caldwell and Fales tests. However,a fundamental understanding and explanation of this critical-speed phenomenonwas completely lacking. Nobody at that time had even the remotest idea of whatwas really happening in this high-speed ﬂow over the airfoil. Members of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics were well aware of the Caldwell-Fales results. Rather than let the matter die, in 1922 theNACA contracted with the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) for a study ofhigh-speed ﬂows over airfoils, with an eye toward improved propeller sections.The work at NBS included the building of a high-speed wind tunnel with a12-in-diameter test section, capable of producing a Mach number of 0.95. Theaerodynamic testing was performed by Lyman J. Briggs (soon to become directorof NBS) and Hugh Dryden (soon to become one of the leading aerodynamicists ofthe twentieth century). In addition to the usual force data, Briggs and Dryden alsomeasured pressure distributions over the airfoil surface. These pressure distribu-tions allowed more insight into the nature of the ﬂow and deﬁnitely indicatedﬂow separation on the top surface of the airfoil. We now know that such ﬂowseparation is induced by a shock wave, but these early researchers did not at thattime know about the presence of such shocks. During the same period, the only meaningful theoretical work on high-speed airfoil properties was carried out by Ludwig Prandtl in Germany and HermannGlauert in England—work which led to the Prandtl-Glauert compressibility cor-rection, given by Equation (11.51). As early as 1922, Prandtl is quoted as statingthat the lift coefﬁcient increased according to (1−M 2 ∞)−1/2; he mentioned this conclusion in his lectures at G¨ ottingen, but without written proof. This result wasmentioned again 6 years later by Jacob Ackeret, a colleague of Prandtl, in thefamous German series Handbuch der Physik, again without proof. Subsequently, in 1928 the concept was formally established by Hermann Glauert, a Britishaerodynamicist working for the Royal Aircraft Establishment. (See Chapter 9 ofReference 21 for a biographical sketch of Glauert.) Using only six pages in theProceedings of the Royal Society, vol. 118, p. 113, Glauert presented a derivation790 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow based on linearized small-perturbation theory (similar to that described in Sec- tion 11.4) which conﬁrmed the (1−M2 ∞)−1/2variation. In this paper, entitled “The Effect of Compressibility on the Lift of an Airfoil,” Glauert derived the fa-mous Prandtl-Glauert compressibility correction, given here as Equations (11.51)to (11.53). This result was to stand alone, unaltered, for the next 10 years. Hence, in 1930 the state of the art of high-speed subsonic airfoil research was characterized by experimental proof of the existence of the drag-divergencephenomenon, some idea that it was caused by ﬂow separation, but no fundamentalunderstanding of the basic ﬂow ﬁeld. In turn, there was virtually no theoreticalbackground outside of the Prandtl-Glauert rule. Also, keep in mind that all theabove work was paced by the need to understand propeller performance, becausein that day the only component of airplanes to encounter compressibility effectswas the propeller tips. All this changed in the 1930s. In 1928, the NACA had constructed its ﬁrst rudi- mentary high-speed subsonic wind tunnel at the Langley Aeronautical Laboratory,utilizing a 1-ft-diameter test section. With Eastman Jacobs as tunnel director andJohn Stack as the chief researcher, a series of tests was run on various standardairfoil shapes. Frustrated by their continual lack of understanding about the ﬂowﬁeld, they turned to optical techniques, following in the footsteps of Ernst Mach(see Section 9.10). In 1933, they assembled a crude schlieren optical system con-sisting of 3-in-diameter reading-glass-quality lenses and a short-duration-sparklight source. In their ﬁrst test using the schlieren system, dealing with ﬂow over acylinder, the results were spectacular. Shock waves were seen, along with the re-sulting ﬂow separation. Visitors ﬂocked to the wind tunnel to observe the results,including Theodore Theodorsen, one of the ranking theoretical aerodynamicistsof that period. An indicator of the psychology at that time is given by Theodorsen’scomment that since the freestream ﬂow was subsonic, what appeared as shockwaves must be an “optical illusion.” However, Eastman Jacobs and John Stackknew differently. They proceeded with a major series of airfoil testing, using stan-dard NACA sections. Their schlieren pictures revealed the secrets of ﬂow overthe airfoils above the critical Mach number. (See Figure 1.38b and its attendant discussion of such supercritical ﬂow.) In 1935, Jacobs traveled to Italy, wherehe presented results of the NACA high-speed airfoil research at the ﬁfth V oltaConference (see Section 7.1). This is the ﬁrst time in history that photographs ofthe transonic ﬂow ﬁeld over standard-shaped airfoils were presented in a largepublic forum. During the course of such work in the 1930s, the incentive for high-speed aerodynamic research shifted from propeller applications to concern about theairframe of the airplane itself. By the mid-1930s, the possibility of the 550 mi/hairplane was more than a dream—reciprocating engines were becoming power-ful enough to consider such a speed regime for propeller-driven aircraft. In turn,the entire airplane itself (wings, cowling, tail, etc.) would encounter compress-ibility effects. This led to the design of a large 8-ft high-speed tunnel at Langley,capable of test-section velocities above 500 mi/h. This tunnel, along with theearlier 1-ft tunnel, established the NACA’s dominance in high-speed subsonicresearch in the late 1930s.CHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 791 In the decade following 1930, the picture had changed completely. By 1940, the high-speed ﬂow over airfoils was relatively well understood. During this period, Stack and Jacobs had not only highlighted the experimental aspects ofsuch high-speed ﬂow, but they also derived the expression for C p,cras a function ofMcrgiven by Equation (11.60), and had shown how to estimate the criti- cal Mach number for a given airfoil as discussed in Section 11.6. Figure 11.30shows some representative schlieren photographs taken by the NACA of the ﬂowover standard NACA airfoils. Although these photographs were taken in 1949, Figure 11.30 Schlieren pictures and pressure distributions for transonic ﬂows over several NACA airfoils. These pictures were taken by the NACA in 1949. (NASA).792 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow they are similar to the results obtained by Stack and Jacobs in the 1930s. Su- perimposed on these photographs are the measured pressure distributions overthe top (solid curve) and bottom (dashed curve) surfaces of the airfoil. Studythese pictures carefully. Moving from bottom to top, you can see the inﬂuenceof increasing freestream Mach number, and going from left to right, you canobserve the effect of increasing airfoil thickness. Note how the shock wavemoves downstream as M ∞is increased, ﬁnally reaching the trailing edge at M∞=1.0. For this case, the top row of pictures shows almost completely supersonic ﬂow over the airfoil. Note also the large regions of separated ﬂowdownstream of the shock waves for the Mach numbers of 0.79, 0.87, and 0.94—this separated ﬂow is the primary reason for the large increase in drag near Mach1. By 1940, it was well understood that the almost discontinuous pressure in-crease across the shock wave creates a strong adverse pressure gradient on theairfoil surface, and this adverse pressure gradient is responsible for separatingthe ﬂow. The high-speed airfoil research program continues today within NASA. It led to the supercritical airfoils in the 1960s (see Sections 11.9 and 11.14). It hasproduced a massive effort in modern times to use computational techniques fortheoretically solving the transonic ﬂow over airfoils. Such efforts are beginningto be successful, and in many respects, today we have the capability to designtransonic airfoils on the computer. However, such abilities today have roots whichreach all the way back to Caldwell and Fales in 1918. For a more detailed account of the history of high-speed airfoil research, you are encouraged to read the entertaining story portrayed by John V .

The importance of this conference to the advancement of high-speed ﬂightin general is noted in Section 7.1; please review that section before reading fur-ther. One of the most farsighted and important papers given at this conference waspresented by Busemann (see Figure 11.31). Entitled “Aerodynamischer Auftriebbei¨Uberschallgeschwindigkert” (“Aerodynamic Forces at Supersonic Speeds”), this paper introduced for the ﬁrst time in history the concept of the swept wingas a mechanism for reducing the large drag increase encountered at supersonicspeeds. Busemann reasoned that the ﬂow over a wing is governed mainly by thecomponent of velocity perpendicular to the leading edge. If the wing is swept, thiscomponent will decrease, as illustrated in Figure 11.32, which is taken directlyfrom Busemann’s original paper. Consequently the supersonic wave drag willdecrease. If the sweep angle is large enough, the normal component of velocitywill be subsonic (the supersonic wing is then said to have a “subsonic leadingCHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 793 Figure 11.31 Adolf Busemann (1901–1986).

Figure 11.33, showing a complete swept-wing planform, is also from Busemann’s paper. At the time of the V olta conference, Adolf Busemann was a relatively young (age 34) but accomplished aerodynamicist. Born in L¨ ubeck, Germany, in 1901,he completed high school in his home town and received his engineering diploma794 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow TU0/H9272 Figure 11.33 A swept-wing airplane planform, from Busemann’s original paper in 1935. and doctorate in engineering in 1924 and 1925, respectively, from the Technische Hochschule in Braunschweig. Busemann was one of the few important Germanaerodynamicists of that era who did not begin as one of Ludwig Prandtl’s stu-dents (see Section 5.8), but in 1925 Busemann began his professional career at theKaiser Wilhelm Institute in G¨ ottingen and soon entered Prandtl’s sphere. From1931 to 1935, Busemann broke away from that sphere to teach in the Engine Lab-oratory of the Technische Hochschule in Dresden. He was still at Dresden whenhe gave his seminal paper at the V olta Conference. Shortly thereafter, he wentto Braunschweig as chief of the Gas Dynamics Division of the Aeronautical Re-search Laboratory (DFL). When the Allied technical teams moved into Germanlaboratories at the end of World War II, they not only scooped up masses of tech-nical aerodynamic data but also effectively scooped up Busemann, who ﬁrst wentto the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough, England, but then acceptedan invitation to join the NACA Langley Memorial Laboratory under OperationPaperclip in 1947. Busemann continued his research on high-speed aerodynam-ics for the NACA after joining Langley. He subsequently became chairman ofthe advanced-study committee at Langley and among other responsibilities su-pervised the preparation of science lectures used for training the early group ofastronauts in the manned space program. In 1963, Busemann became a profes-sor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences at the University ofColorado in Boulder. After retirement, he remained in Boulder, leading an activelife until his death in 1986.CHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 795 The swept-wing concept in Busemann’s 1935 V olta Conference paper was, for everybody outside of Germany, an idea before its time. It is difﬁcult to understand how the premier aerodynamicist in the United States, Theodor von K´ arm´ an,and other attendees failed to appreciate the signiﬁcance of Busemann’s idea,even forgetting it entirely, for that very evening Busemann went to dinner withvon K´ arm´ an, Hugh Dryden (see Section 11.11), and General Arturo Crocco, the organizer of the conference. During dinner, Crocco sketched on the back of amenu card an airplane with swept wings, swept tail, and swept propeller, callingit, facetiously, “Busemann’s airplane of the future.” There was no such facetiousness in Germany. The German Luftwaffe recog- nized the military signiﬁcance of the swept wing, and classiﬁed the concept in1936—one year after the conference. From that time until the end of World War II,the Germans produced a large bulk of swept-wing research, a secret known onlyto themselves. Moreover, they expanded the horizons of the swept wing to high-speed subsonic and transonic airplanes, recognizing that the same aerodynamicmechanism described in Busemann’s V olta Conference paper would serve to in-crease the critical Mach number for such aircraft. Experimental results for sweptwings at high subsonic Mach numbers were ﬁrst reported by Hubert Ludweig in1939, as shown in Figure 11.34. Here the drag polars (deﬁned in Section 5.3.3as lift coefﬁcient C Aversus drag coefﬁcient CW, in the German notation) for a straight wing and a swept wing are compared. These are the original ﬁgures fromthe German report A V A-Bericht 39/H/18, 1939. This was top-secret data obtainedin a new high-speed wind tunnel at the Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt (A V A)in G¨ ottingen, and represented just the tip of the iceberg of German swept-wing re-search to follow. In his recent article, Peter Hamel (“Birth of Sweepback: RelatedResearch at Luftfahrtforschungsanstalt–Germany,” Journal of Aircraft, vol. 42, no. 4, July–August 2005, pp. 801–813) labels this data as the ﬁrst from what wasto be “established systematic wind-tunnel tests to generate a world-ﬁrst databasefor future transonic aircraft conﬁgurations with wing sweep.” Meanwhile, Robert T. Jones (Figure 11.35), a leading aerodynamicist at the NACA Langley Memorial Laboratory, independently discovered the advantagesof a swept wing. Jones was a self-made person. Born in Macon, Missouri, in1910, Jones was totally captivated by aeronautics at an early age. He later wrotein 1977 (“Recollections from an Earlier Period in American Aeronautics,” inAnnual Review of Fluid Mechanics, vol. 9, M. Van Dyke et al (eds), pp. 1–11): All during the late twenties the weekly magazine Aviation appeared on the local newsstand in my hometown, Macon, Missouri. Aviation carried technical articles by eminent aeronautical engineers such as B. V . Korvin-Krovkovsky, Alexander Klemin, and others. Included in both Aero Digest andAviation were notices of forthcoming NACA Technical Reports andNotes. These could be procured from the Government Printing Ofﬁce usually for ten cents and sometimes even free simply for writingNACA Headquarters in Washington. The contents of these reports seemed muchmore interesting to me than the regular high school and college curricula, and Isuspect that my English teachers may have been quite perplexed by the essays Iwrote for them on aeronautical subjects.0.3 0.1 0.2 0.20.20.40.60.81.0 0.1 0.50 0.25 0.500.3 0.75 0.251.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 /H110020.2 /H110020.4 /H110020.4/H110020.2CA CwGepfeilter Trapezflügel Garader Trapezflügel CmoCA CmoCwM /H11005 0.7 M /H11005 0.9 M /H11005 0.7M /H11005 0.9 Figure 11.34 Drag polars at Mach 0.7 and 0.9 for a straight wing (left) and swept wing (right), as reported by Ludwieg in 1939. 796CHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 797 Figure 11.35 Robert T. Jones (1910–1999) (NASA). Jones attended the University of Missouri for one year, but left to take a se- ries of aeronautics-related jobs, ﬁrst as a crew member with Marie Meyer Flying Circus, and then with the Nicholas-Beazley Airplane Company in Marshall, Mis-souri, which was just starting to produce a single-engine, low-wing monoplanedesigned by the noted British aeronautical engineer Walter H. Barling. At onetime, Nicholas-Beazley was producing and selling one of those aircraft each day.However, the company became a victim of the Depression, and in 1933 Jonesfound himself working as an elevator operator in Washington, D.C., and takingnight classes in aeronautics at Catholic University, taught by Max Monk. Thatcontact began a lifelong friendship between Jones and Monk. In 1934 the PublicWorks Administration created a number of temporary scientiﬁc positions in thefederal government. On the recommendation of Congressman David J. Lewis,from Jones’s hometown, Jones received a nine-month appointment at the NACALangley Memorial Laboratory. That was the beginning of a lifetime career forJones at the NACA/NASA. Through a passionate interest and self-study in aero-nautics, Jones had become exceptionally knowledgeable in aerodynamic theory.His talents were recognized at Langley, and he was kept on at the laboratorythrough a series of temporary and emergency reappointments for the next twoyears. Unable to promote him into the lowest professional engineering gradebecause of civil-service regulations that required a college degree, in 1936 thelaboratory management was ﬁnally able to hire Jones permanently via a loophole:It hired Jones at the next grade above the lowest, for which the requirement of acollege degree was not speciﬁcally stated (although presumed).798 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow By 1944, Jones was one of the most respected aerodynamicists in the NACA. At that time he was working on the design of an experimental air-to-air missile for the Army Air Force and he was also studying the aerodynamics of a proposedglide bomb having a low-aspect-ratio delta wing. The Ludington-Griswald Com-pany of Saybrook, Connecticut, had carried out wind-tunnel tests on a dart-shapedmissile of their design, and Roger Griswold, president of the company, showed thedata to Jones in 1944. Griswold had compared the lift data for the missile’s low-aspect-ratio delta wing with calculations made from Prandtl’s tried-and-provedlifting-line theory (Section 5.3). Jones realized that Prandtl’s lifting-line theorywas not valid for low-aspect-ratio wings, and he began to construct a more appro-priate theory for the delta-wing planform. Jones obtained rather simple analyticalequations for the low-speed, incompressible ﬂow over delta wings, but consideredthe theory to be “so crude” that “nobody would be interested in it.” He placed hisanalysis in his desk and went on with other matters. In early 1945 Jones began to look at the mathematical theory of supersonic potential (irrotational) ﬂows. When applied to delta wings, Jones found that he wasobtaining equations similar to those he had found for incompressible ﬂow usingthe crude theory that was now buried in his desk. Searching for an explanation, herecalled the statement by Max Munk in 1924 that the aerodynamic characteristicsof a wing were governed mainly by the component of the freestream velocityperpendicular to the leading edge. The answer suddenly was quite simple: For thedelta wing, the reason his supersonic ﬁndings were the same as his earlier low-speed ﬁndings was that the leading edge of the delta wing was swept far enoughthat the component of the supersonic free stream Mach number perpendicularto the leading edge was subsonic, and hence the supersonic swept wing actedas if it were in a subsonic ﬂow. With that revelation, Jones had independentlydiscovered the high-speed aerodynamic advantage of swept wings, albeit 10 yearsafter Busemann’s paper at the V olta conference. Jones began to discuss his swept-wing theory with colleagues at NACA Langley. In mid-February 1945 he outlined his thoughts to Jean Roche and EzraKotcher of the Army Air Force at Wright Field. On March 5, 1945, he sent amemo to Gus Crowley, chief of research at Langley, stated that he had “recentlymade a theoretical analysis which indicates that a V-shaped wing traveling pointforemost would be less affected by compressibility than other planforms. In fact,if the angle of the V is kept small relative to the Mach angle, the lift and centerof pressure remain the same at speeds both above and below the speed of sound.”In the same memo, Jones asked Crowley to approve experimental work on sweptwings. Such work was quickly initiated by the Flight Research Section of Langley,under the direction of Robert Gilruth, beginning with a series of free-ﬂight testsusing bodies with swept wings dropped from high altitude. Jones ﬁnished a formal report on his low-aspect-ratio wing theory in late April 1945, including the effects of compressibility and the concept of a sweptwing. However, during the in-house editorial review of that report, TheodoreTheodorsen raised some serious objections. Theodorsen did not like the heavilyintuitive nature of Jones’s theory, and he asked Jones to clarify the “hocus-pocus”with some “real mathematics.” Furthermore, because supersonic ﬂow was soCHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 799 different physically and mathematically from subsonic ﬂow, Theodorsen could not accept the “subsonic” behavior of Jones’s highly swept wings at supersonicspeeds. Criticizing Jones’s entire swept-wing concept, calling it “a snare and adelusion,” Theodorsen insisted that Jones take out the part about swept wings. Theodorsen’s insistence prevailed, and publication of Jones’s report was de- layed. However, at the end of May 1945, Gilruth’s free-ﬂight tests dramaticallyveriﬁed Jones’s predictions, showing a factor of 4 reduction in drag due to sweep-ing the wings. Quickly following those data, wind-tunnel tests carried out in asmall supersonic wind tunnel at Langley showed a large reduction in drag on asection of wire in the test section when the wire was placed at a substantial angleof sweep relative to the ﬂow in the test section. With that experimental proofof the validity of the swept-wing concept, Langley forwarded Jones’s report toNACA Headquarters in Washington for publication. But Theodorsen would notgive up: The transmittal letter to NACA Headquarters contained the statement that“Dr. Theodore Theodorsen (still) does not agree with the arguments presentedand the conclusions reached and accordingly declined to participate in editing thepaper.” Such recalcitrance on the part of Theodorsen is reminiscent of his refusalto believe that the shock waves seen in John Stack’s schlieren photographs ofthe transonic ﬂow over an airfoil 11 years earlier were real (see Section 11.11).Theodorsen certainly made important contributions to airfoil theory in the 1930s,but he was also capable of errors in judgment (i.e., he was human). On June 21, 1945, the NACA issued Jones’s report as a conﬁdential memo- randum, chieﬂy for the Army and Navy. Three weeks later, the report was reissuedas an advance conﬁdential report, sent by registered mail to those people in in-dustry with a “need to know.” Entitled “Wing Plan Forms for High-Speed Flight,”Jones’s report quickly spread the idea of the swept wing to selected members ofthe aeronautical community in the United States, but by that time, informationabout the German swept-wing research was beginning to reach the same aero-nautical community. Jones’s work appeared in the open literature about a yearlater, as NACA TR 863, a technical report only ﬁve pages long, but a classicexplanation of how a swept wing works aerodynamically. Credit for the idea of the swept wing for high-speed ﬂight is shared between Busemann and Jones. Separated by a time interval of 10 years, and the closed shopsof military security in both Germany and the United States, each independentlydeveloped the concept, not knowing of the other’s work. The full impact of theswept-wing concept on the aeronautical industry came directly after the end ofWorld War II, with almost simultaneous release of similar information from bothsides of the ocean, thus promoting conﬁdence in the validity of the concept. The speed at which this information was used for airplane design is nothing short of amazing. Boeing’s chief aerodynamicist, George Schairer, was a memberof one of the Allied technical intelligence teams sent to Germany in April 1945.On the ﬂight over, Schairer, who was aware of Jones’s swept-wing concept andthat Jones’s report was being held up in the editorial process, reported that theconcept was the main topic of conversation. Concluding that sweepback was avalid concept, Schairer needed no convincing of its value when the team sawthe German swept-wing data at Baunschweig on May 7. On May 10 he sent a800 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow seminal and historically important letter to Boeing directing that a new design for a straight-wing jet bomber immediately be changed to a swept-wing conﬁguration,and that other aircraft manufacturers be informed about the German swept-wingresearch. At Boeing, the result of this letter was the Boeing B-47, shown in Figure11.36, and at North American the result was the famous F-86 (Figure 11.15). TheB-47 sowed the seeds for the Boeing 707 swept-wing jet transport (Figure 1.2)and for all subsequent large commercial jet transports to the present day. Indeed, by 1948 the swept wing had become an accepted airplane design feature. It had done for the high-speed jet airplane what streamlining had donein the 1930s for the advanced propeller-driven airplane, namely, provided theaerodynamic means for efﬁcient ﬂight in the desired ﬂight regime. Virtually all Figure 11.36 Three-view of the Boeing B-47 swept-wing bomber, circa 1948.CHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 801 high-speed, jet-propelled airplanes today have wings with highly swept leading edges, and these contemporary aircraft can trace their ancestry directly back tothe B-47 and the F-86, and to the innovative ideas and genius of Adolf Busemannand Robert Jones.

WHITCOMB—ARCHITECT OF THE AREA RULE AND THE SUPERCRITICAL WING The developments of the area rule (Section 11.8) and the supercritical airfoil (Section 11.9) are two of the most important advancements in aerodynamicssince 1950. That both developments were made by the same man—Richard T.Whitcomb—is remarkable. Who is this man? What qualities lead to such accom-plishments? Let us pursue these matters further. Richard Whitcomb was born on February 21, 1921, in Evanston, Illinois. At an early age, he was inﬂuenced by his grandfather, who had known Thomas A.Edison. In an interview with The Washington Post on August 31, 1969, Whitcomb is quoted as saying: “I used to sit around and hear stories about Edison. He sort ofdeveloped into my idol.” Whitcomb entered the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in1939. (This is the same school from which the rocket pioneer, Robert H. Goddard,had graduated 31 years earlier.) Whitcomb distinguished himself in college andgraduated with a mechanical engineering degree with honors in 1943. Informedby a Fortune magazine article on the research facilities at the NACA Langley Memorial Laboratory, Whitcomb immediately joined the NACA. He became awind-tunnel engineer, and as an early assignment he worked on design problemsassociated with the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. He remained with the NACA andlater its successor, NASA, until his retirement in 1980—spending his entire careerwith the wind tunnels at the Langley Research Center. In the process, he rose tobecome head of the Eight-foot Tunnel Branch at Langley. He died of pneumoniaat the age of 88 on October 13, 2009 in Newport News, Virginia. Whitcomb conceived the idea of the area rule as early as 1951. He tested his idea in the transonic wind tunnel at Langley. The results were so promising that theaeronautical industry changed designs in midstream. For example, the Convair F-102 delta-wing ﬁghter had been designed for supersonic ﬂight, but was having ma-jor difﬁculty even exceeding the speed of sound—the increase in drag near Mach1 was simply too large. The F-102 was redesigned to incorporate Whitcomb’s arearule and afterward was able to achieve its originally intended supersonic Machnumber. The area rule was such an important aerodynamic breakthrough that itwas classiﬁed “secret” from 1952 to 1954, when airplanes incorporating the arearule began to roll off the production line. In 1954, Whitcomb was given the CollierTrophy—an annual award for the “greatest achievement in aviation in America.” In the early 1960s, Whitcomb turned his attention to airfoil design, with the objective again of decreasing the large drag rise near Mach 1. Using the exist-ing knowledge about airfoil properties, a great deal of wind-tunnel testing, and802 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow intuition honed by years of experience, Whitcomb produced the supercritical air- foil. Again, this development had a major impact on the aeronautical industry, andtoday virtually all new commercial transport and executive aircraft designs areincorporating a supercritical wing. Because of his development of the supercriti-cal airfoil, in 1974 NASA gave Whitcomb a cash award of $25,000—the largestcash award ever given by NASA to a single individual. There are certain parallels between the personalities of the Wright brothers and Richard Whitcomb: (1) they all had powerful intuitive abilities which theybrought to bear on the problem of ﬂight, (2) they were totally dedicated to theirwork (none of them ever married), and (3) they did a great deal of their workthemselves, trusting only their own results. For example, here is a quote fromWhitcomb which appears in the same Washington Post interview mentioned above. Concerning the detailed work on the development of the supercriticalairfoil, Whitcomb says: I modiﬁed the shape of the wing myself as we tested it. It’s just plain easier this way. In fact my reputation for ﬁling the wing’s shape has become so notorious that thepeople at North American have threatened to provide me with a 10-foot ﬁle to workon the real airplane, also. Perhaps the real ingredient for Whitcomb’s success is his personal philosophy, as well as his long hours at work daily. In his own words: There’s been a continual drive in me ever since I was a teenager to ﬁnd a better way to do everything. A lot of very intelligent people are willing to adapt, but only to acertain extent. If a human mind can ﬁgure out a better way to do something, let’s doit. I can’t just sit around. I have to think. Students take note! 11.15 SUMMARY Review the road map in Figure 11.1, and make certain that you have all the concepts listed on this map well in mind. Some of the highlights of this chapterare as follows: For two-dimensional, irrotational, isentropic, steady ﬂow of a compressibleﬂuid, the exact velocity potential equation is /bracketleftBigg 1−1 a2/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂x/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg ∂2φ ∂x2+/bracketleftBigg 1−1 a2/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂y/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg ∂2φ ∂y2 (11.12) −2 a2/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂x/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂y/parenrightbigg∂2φ ∂x∂y=0 wherea2=a2 0−γ−1 2/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂x/parenrightbigg2 +/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂y/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg (11.13) This equation is exact, but it is nonlinear and hence difﬁcult to solve. At present,no general analytical solution to this equation exists.CHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 803 For the case of small perturbations (slender bodies at low angles of attack), the exact velocity potential equation can be approximated by /parenleftbig1−M2 ∞/parenrightbig∂2ˆφ ∂x2+∂2ˆφ ∂y2=0 (11.18) This equation is approximate, but linear, and hence more readily solved. Thisequation holds for subsonic (0≤M ∞≤0.8)and supersonic (1.2≤M∞≤5) ﬂows; it does not hold for transonic (0.8≤M∞≤1.2)or hypersonic (M∞> 5)ﬂows. The Prandtl-Glauert rule is a compressibility correction that allows the modiﬁ-cation of existing incompressible ﬂow data to take into account compressibilityeffects: C p=Cp,0/radicalbig 1−M2 ∞(11.51) Also, cl=cl,0/radicalbig 1−M2 ∞(11.52) and cm=cm,0/radicalbig 1−M2 ∞(11.53) The critical Mach number is that freestream Mach number at which sonic ﬂowis ﬁrst obtained at some point on the surface of a body. For thin airfoils, thecritical Mach number can be estimated as shown in Figure 11.6. The drag-divergence Mach number is that freestream Mach number at whicha large rise in the drag coefﬁcient occurs, as shown in Figure 11.11. The area rule for transonic ﬂow states that the cross-sectional area distribu-tion of an airplane, including fuselage, wing, and tail, should have a smoothdistribution along the axis of the airplane. Supercritical airfoils are specially designed proﬁles to increase the drag-divergence Mach number.804 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 11.16 INTEGRATED WORK CHALLENGE: TRANSONIC TESTING BY THE WING-FLOW METHOD Concept: At the end of World War II, the speeds of ﬁghter airplanes were ap- proaching Mach 1, and the need for transonic aerodynamic data became paramount. Such data, however, was in short supply. There existed no reliable transonic windtunnels at that time, and because the governing equations for transonic ﬂow arenonlinear, no accurate analytical solutions were available (see Section 11.2).Faced with this dismal situation, engineers at the NACA Langley MemorialAeronautical Laboratory (now the NASA Langley Research Center) came upwith three innovative techniques for obtaining aerodynamic data in the transonicﬂight regime. The ﬁrst was the falling-body method, wherein a heavy aerody-namic model was carried to 30,000 feet by a B-29 bomber and then released. Onits way down, the terminal velocity of the model became transonic, and aerody-namic data was radioed to receivers on the ground. A somewhat related secondmethod involved mounting a model on a rocket that was launched from the smallNACA facility on Wallops Island, Virginia, and again transonic aerodynamicdata was radioed to receivers on the ground using telemetering instrumentationthat was originally developed for the falling-body tests. The third method, how-ever, was the most innovative and was totally different from the others. Called thewing-ﬂow method, it is the subject of this Integrated Work Challenge section. The wing-ﬂow method involved mounting a small wing model vertically on the surface of the wing of a P-51 Mustang ﬁghter airplane at a location insidethe bubble of locally supersonic ﬂow existing on the P-51 wing when the air-plane exceeded its critical Mach number during a high-speed dive. (This locallysupersonic bubble is diagramed in Figures 11.5d and 11.11.) Aerodynamic data such as lift, drag, moments, hinge moments, and pressure distributions on the testmodel were recorded and stored by instruments housed in an empty ammunitioncompartment inside the P-51 wing. Both straight- and swept-wing models weretested. Figure 11.37 is a photograph showing a swept-wing model mounted onthe P-51 wing. Integrated Work Challenge: Design the setup for a wing-ﬂow test, i.e., address the following questions: (a)Where on the P-51 wing is the best location for mounting the test model? (b)At this location, what are the local ﬂow properties over the model? (c)How far above the P-51 wing surface can the model reach, i.e., what is the allowable span of the model? (d)Does the boundary layer on the P-51 wing pose a problem for the model? Solution: To decide where on the P-51 wing is the best location for the model, we ﬁrst need to know the distribution of the local ﬂow Mach number over thewing surface. At the time of the original NACA tests in the middle 1940s, thisdetermination was obtained by making static pressure measurements along theCHAPTER 11 Subsonic Compressible Flow over Airfoils: Linear Theory 805 Figure 11.37 Photograph of a test model mounted on the wing of the P-51 used for the NACA Wing-Flow transonic tests, circa 1946. (NASA). surface of the P-51 in ﬂight and by using the isentropic ﬂow relations, obtaining the local Mach number at points along the wing. In essence, we will carry out thesame approach here, but instead of using the older pressure data, we will obtainthe local Mach numbers from modern computational ﬂuid dynamic calculationsof the pressure coefﬁcients over a P-51 wing. These calculations were made byDavid Lednicer and published among other places in the article “World War IIFighter Aerodynamics,” Sport Aviation, January 1999, pp. 85–91. Figure 11.38 is a plot of the calculated pressure coefﬁcient over the P-51 wing in cruise, basedon Lednicer’s calculations. The airfoil used on the P-51 was an NACA laminarﬂow airfoil; the shape of the airfoil is also shown in Figure 11.38. In conjunctionwith Figure 4.2, we noted that these airfoils in service in the ﬁeld never producedthe desired amount of laminar ﬂow, but by a stroke of serendipity they had highercritical Mach numbers, prompted by a long favorable pressure gradient withminimum pressure occurring far downstream of the leading edge. For example,in Figure 11.38, the minimum pressure coefﬁcient is −0.575, and it occurs at about midchord along the airfoil. Returning to our work challenge, we address the question: Where on the wing airfoil should the test model be placed? The answer is straightforward;it should be placed at the location where the local Mach number is maximum,which corresponds to the location of the minimum pressure coefﬁcient.

Figure 11.38, this location is in the region between x/c=0.4 and 0.5, where the minimum value of Cpis relatively ﬂat. To estimate the maximum local Mach number in this region, we need to know the maximum speed of the P-51 during the test. The most deﬁnitive paper on the NACA wing-ﬂow tests is by Robert R. Gilruth, chief engineer of the project,entitled “Resume and Analysis of NACA Wing-Flow Tests,” Anglo-AmericanAeronautical Conference, London, 3–5 September 1947, and published by theRoyal Aeronautical Society in 1948, pp. 363–383. In this paper, Gilruth notesthat the maximum ﬂight Mach number of the P-51 for the tests was 0.76. Wewill use this value in our analysis here. Also, to obtain the maximum local Machnumber on the P-51 wing, we need to know the minimum pressure coefﬁcient onthe wing. For this information, we will use the CFD results of Lednicer as plottedin Figure 11.38, suitably modiﬁed for compressibility effects as follows. Lednicer’s calculations were made for the P-51 in cruise. Loftin, in his book Quest for Performance: The Evolution of Modern Aircraft, NASA SP-468, 1985,gives the cruise velocity for the P-51 as 362 mph. This is a speed low enoughthat compressibility effects are small, and we will interpret the C presults in Figure 11.38 to be “low speed results” that need to be corrected for compressibilityeffects at the maximum Mach number of 0.76. We choose to use the Karman–Tsien compressibility correction rule given in Equation (11.54), which was widelyadopted after World War II.

Gilruth, in his presentation to the Anglo-American Aeronautical Confer- ence in 1947, states that “preliminary tests indicated that the local Mach number808 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow increased smoothly from about 0.40 to about 1.15 as the ﬂight Mach number of the airplane was increased from 0.30 to 0.76.” Those indications were based onexperimental measurements obtained in ﬂight. Our calculated result of a localMach number of 1.23, based on modern CFD calculations and using a reasonablecompressibility correction for pressure coefﬁcient, agrees with Gilruth’s data towithin 7 percent. Other local ﬂow ﬁeld variables such as static pressure and temperature can be calculated for the local Mach number of 1.23 using the isentropic relationsdiscussed in Chapter 8. These results, however, will depend on the altitude ofthe airplane. The vertical extent of the supersonic bubble above the wing can beobtained by carrying out a detailed computational ﬂuid dynamic calculation of theﬂow ﬁeld over the P-51 and tracing the sonic line in the ﬂow. We note that Gilruthcarried out measurements of the vertical gradients in Mach number and foundthat they did not exceed about 1 percent per inch and “were probably somewhatless than this ﬁgure,” thus presenting a reasonably comfortable vertical extent ofthe testing region. Finally, the Reynolds numbers associated with the high speedof the P-51 were large, resulting in a thin boundary layer thickness on the wingsurface of no real consequence on the model tests. 11.17 PROBLEMS 11.1 Consider a subsonic compressible ﬂow in cartesian coordinates where thevelocity potential is given by φ(x,y)=V ∞x+70 sin(2π x)/radicalbig 1−M2 ∞e−2π y√ 1−M2∞ If the freestream properties are given by V∞=700 ft/s, p∞=1 atm, and T∞=519◦R, calculate the following properties at the location (x,y)= (0.2 ft, 0.2 ft): M,p, and T. 11.2 Using the Prandtl-Glauert rule, calculate the lift coefﬁcient for an NACA2412 airfoil at 5 ◦angle of attack in a Mach 0.6 freestream.

At a given point on the airfoil, the local Mach number is 0.86. Using the compressible ﬂow tablesat the back of this book, calculate the pressure coefﬁcient at that point.Check your answer using the appropriate analytical equation from thischapter. [Note: This problem is analogous to an incompressible problem where the freestream velocity and the velocity at a point are given, andthe pressure coefﬁcient is calculated from Equation (3.38). In anincompressible ﬂow, the pressure coefﬁcient at any point in the ﬂow is aunique function of the local velocity at that point and the freestreamvelocity. In the present problem, we see that Mach number is the relevantproperty for a compressible ﬂow—not velocity. The pressure coefﬁcientfor an inviscid compressible ﬂow is a unique function of the local Machnumber and the freestream Mach number.] 11.7 Figure 11.5 shows four cases for the ﬂow over the same airfoil wherein M ∞is progressively increased from 0.3 to Mcr=0.61. Have you wondered where the numbers on Figure 11.5 came from? Here is yourchance to ﬁnd out. Point Aon the airfoil is the point of minimum pressure (hence maximum M) on the airfoil. Assume that the minimum pressure (maximum Mach number) continues to occur at this same point as M ∞is increased. In part (a)of Figure 11.5, for M∞=0.3, the local Mach number at point Awas arbitrarily chosen as MA=0.435, this arbitrariness is legitimate because we have not speciﬁed the airfoil shape,but rather are stating that, whatever the shape is, a maximum Machnumber of 0.435 occurs at point Aon the airfoil surface. However, once the numbers are given for part (a), then the numbers for parts (b),(c), and(d)arenotarbitrary. Rather, M Ais a unique function of M∞for the remaining pictures. With all this as background information, startingwith the data shown in Figure 11.5 a,calculate M Awhen M∞=0.61. Obviously, from Figure 11.5d , your result should turn out to be MA=1.0 because M∞=0.61 is said to be the critical Mach number. Said in another way, you are being asked to prove that the critical Mach numberfor this airfoil is 0.61. Hint: For simplicity, assume that the Prandtl-Glauert rule holds for the conditions of this problem. 11.8 Consider the ﬂow over a circular cylinder; the incompressible ﬂow oversuch a cylinder is discussed in Section 3.13. Consider also the ﬂow over asphere; the incompressible ﬂow over a sphere is described in Section 6.4.The subsonic compressible ﬂow over both the cylinder and the sphere isqualitatively similar but quantitatively different from their incompressiblecounterparts. Indeed, because of the “bluntness” of these bodies, theircritical Mach numbers are relatively low. In particular: For a cylinder: M cr=0.404 For a sphere: Mcr=0.57 Explain on a physical basis why the sphere has a higher Mcrthan the cylinder.810 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 11.9 In Problem 11.8, the critical Mach number for a circular cylinder is given asMcr=0.404. This value is based on experimental measurements, and therefore is considered reasonably accurate. Calculate Mcrfor a circular cylinder using the incompressible result for Cpand the Prandtl-Glauert compressibility correction, and compare your result with the experimentalvalue. Note: The Prandtl-Glauert rule is based on linear theory assuming small perturbations, and therefore we would not expect that it would bevalid for the case of ﬂow over a circular cylinder. Nevertheless, when youuse it to make this calculation of M cr, you will ﬁnd your calculated result to be within 3.5 percent of the experimental value. Interesting.CHAPTER12 Linearized Supersonic Flow With the stabilizer setting at 2◦the speed was allowed to increase to approximately 0.98 to 0.99 Mach number where elevator and rudder effectiveness were regained and the airplane seemed to smooth out to normalﬂying characteristics. This development lent added conﬁdence and the airplanewas allowed to continue until an indication of 1.02 on the cockpit Mach meterwas obtained. At this indication the meter momentarily stopped and thenjumped at 1.06, and this hesitation was assumed to be caused by the effect ofshock waves on the static source. At this time the power units were cut and theairplane allowed to decelerate back to the subsonic ﬂight condition. Captain Charles Yeager, describing hisﬂight on October 14, 1947—the ﬁrstmanned ﬂight to exceed the speedof sound. PREVIEW BOX The calculation of lift and drag for an airfoil at super- sonic speeds is about as different from that for lower-speed airfoils as night is from day. The physics ofa supersonic ﬂow is completely different from thatof a subsonic ﬂow, and therefore virtually nothingdiscussed in Chapter 4 or Chapter 11 can be usedto calculate the properties of an airfoil at supersonicspeeds. So what can you do? The answer is that youcan read this chapter. It is short and sweet, and itprovides some simple results that you can use toestimate the aerodynamic properties of supersonicairfoils. 811812 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 12.1 INTRODUCTION The linearized perturbation velocity potential equation derived in Chapter 11, Equation (11.18), is /parenleftbig1−M2 ∞/parenrightbig∂2ˆφ ∂x2+∂2ˆφ ∂y2=0 (11.18) and holds for both subsonic and supersonic ﬂow. In Chapter 11, we treated thecase of subsonic ﬂow, where 1 −M 2 ∞>0 in Equation (11.18). However, for supersonic ﬂow, 1 −M2 ∞<0. This seemingly innocent change in sign on the ﬁrst term of Equation (11.18) is, in reality, a very dramatic change. Mathematically,when 1 −M 2 ∞>0 for subsonic ﬂow, Equation (11.18) is an elliptic partial differ- ential equation, whereas when 1 −M2 ∞<0 for supersonic ﬂow, Equation (11.18) becomes a hyperbolic differential equation. The details of this mathematical dif- ference are beyond the scope of this book; however, the important point is thatthere isa difference. Moreover, this portends a fundamental difference in the physical aspects of subsonic and supersonic ﬂow—something we have alreadydemonstrated in previous chapters. The purpose of this chapter is to obtain a solution of Equation (11.18) for supersonic ﬂow and to apply this solution to the calculation of supersonic airfoilproperties. Since our purpose is straightforward, and since this chapter is relativelyshort, there is no need for a chapter road map to provide guidance on the ﬂow ofour ideas. 12.2 DERIVATION OF THE LINEARIZED SUPERSONIC PRESSURE COEFFICIENT FORMULA For the case of supersonic ﬂow, let us write Equation (11.18) as λ2∂2ˆφ ∂x2−∂ˆφ ∂y2=0 (12.1) where λ=/radicalbig M2 ∞−1. A solution to this equation is the functional relation ˆφ=f(x−λy) (12.2) We can demonstrate this by substituting Equation (12.2) into Equation (12.1) as follows. The partial derivative of Equation (12.2) with respect to xcan be written as ∂ˆφ ∂x=f/prime(x−λy)∂(x−λy) ∂x or∂ˆφ ∂x=f/prime(12.3) In Equation (12.3), the prime denotes differentiation of fwith respect to its argument, x−λy. Differentiating Equation (12.3) again with respect to x, we obtain ∂2ˆφ ∂x2=f/prime/prime(12.4)CHAPTER 12 Linearized Supersonic Flow 813 Similarly,∂ˆφ ∂y=f/prime(x−λy)∂(x−λy) ∂y or∂ˆφ ∂y=f/prime(−λ) (12.5) Differentiating Equation (12.5) again with respect to y, we have ∂2ˆφ ∂y2=λ2f/prime/prime(12.6) Substituting Equations (12.4) and (12.6) into (12.1), we obtain the identity λ2f/prime/prime−λ2f/prime/prime=0 Hence, Equation (12.2) is indeed a solution of Equation (12.1). Examine Equation (12.2) closely. This solution is not very speciﬁc, because fcan be anyfunction of x−λy. However, Equation (12.2) tells us something speciﬁc about the ﬂow, namely, that ˆφisconstant along lines of x−λy=constant. The slope of these lines is obtained from x−λy=const Hence,dy dx=1 λ=1/radicalbig M2 ∞−1(12.7) From Equation (9.31) and the accompanying Figure 9.25, we know that tanμ=1/radicalbig M2 ∞−1(12.8) where μis the Mach angle. Therefore, comparing Equations (12.7) and (12.8), we see that a line along which ˆφis constant is a Mach line. This result is sketched in Figure 12.1, which shows supersonic ﬂow over a surface with a small hump in the middle, where θis the angle of the surface relative to the horizontal. According to Equations (12.1) to (12.8), all disturbances created at the wall(represented by the perturbation potential ˆφ) propagate unchanged away from the wall along Mach waves. All the Mach waves have the same slope, namely,dy/dx=(M 2 ∞−1)−1/2. Note that the Mach waves slope downstream above the wall. Hence, any disturbance at the wall cannot propagate upstream; its effect 1M/H11009 > 1 M2 /H11009 /H11002 1 (/H11002) (/H11001)dy dx=/H9278 = c1 /H9278 = c2 /H9278 = c3 etc./H9262 /H9258 Figure 12.1 Linearized supersonic ﬂow.814 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow is limited to the region of the ﬂow downstream of the Mach wave emanating from the point of the disturbance. This is a further substantiation of the major dif-ference between subsonic and supersonic ﬂows mentioned in previous chapters,namely, disturbances propagate everywhere throughout a subsonic ﬂow, whereas they cannot propagate upstream in a steady supersonic ﬂow. Keep in mind that the above results, as well as the picture in Figure 12.1, per- tain to linearized supersonic ﬂow [because Equation (12.1) is a linear equation]. Hence, these results assume small perturbations; that is, the hump in Figure 12.1 is small, and thus θis small. Of course, we know from Chapter 9 that in reality a shock wave will be induced by the forward part of the hump, and an expansionwave will emanate from the remainder of the hump. These are waves of ﬁnitestrength and are not a part of linearized theory. Linearized theory is approximate;one of the consequences of this approximation is that waves of ﬁnite strength(shock and expansion waves) are not admitted. The above results allow us to obtain a simple expression for the pressure coefﬁcient in supersonic ﬂow, as follows. From Equation (12.3), ˆu=∂ˆφ ∂x=f/prime(12.9) and from Equation (12.5), ˆv=∂ˆφ ∂y=−λf/prime(12.10) Eliminating f/primefrom Equations (12.9) and (12.10), we obtain ˆu=−ˆv λ(12.11) Recall the linearized boundary condition given by Equation (11.34), repeatedbelow: ˆv=∂ˆφ ∂y=V∞tanθ (12.12) We can further reduce Equation (12.12) by noting that, for small perturbations, θ is small. Hence, tan θ≈θ, and Equation (12.12) becomes ˆv=V∞θ (12.13) Substituting Equation (12.13) into (12.11), we obtain ˆu=−V∞θ λ(12.14) Recall the linearized pressure coefﬁcient given by Equation (11.32): Cp=−2ˆu V∞(11.32) Substituting Equation (12.14) into (11.32), and recalling that λ≡/radicalbig M2 ∞−1, we have Cp=2θ/radicalbig M2 ∞−1(12.15)Anderson-3930659 book August 29, 2016 10:54 CHAPTER 12 Linearized Supersonic Flow 815 Equation (12.15) is important. It is the linearized supersonic pressure coefﬁcient, and it states that Cpis directly proportional to the local surface inclination with respect to the freestream. It holds for any slender two-dimensional body where θ is small. Return again to Figure 12.1. Note that θis positive when measured above the horizontal, and negative when measured below the horizontal. Hence, fromEquation (12.15), C pis positive on the forward portion of the hump, and negative on the rear portion. This is denoted by the (+) and(−) signs in front of and behind the hump shown in Figure 12.1. This is also somewhat consistent withour discussions in Chapter 9; in the real ﬂow over the hump, a compression waveforms on that part of the front portion where the ﬂow is being turned into itself,and hence p>p ∞, whereas an expansion wave occurs over that portion of the hump where the ﬂow is turned away from itself, and the pressure decreases. Thinkabout the picture shown in Figure 12.1; the pressure is higher on the front sectionof the hump, and lower on the rear section. As a result, a drag force exists on thehump. This drag is called wave drag and is a characteristic of supersonic ﬂows. Wave drag was discussed in Section 9.7 in conjunction with shock-expansiontheory applied to supersonic airfoils. It is interesting that linearized supersonictheory also predicts a ﬁnite wave drag, although shock waves themselves are nottreated in such linearized theory. Examining Equation (12.15), we note that C p∝(M2 ∞−1)−1/2; hence, for supersonic ﬂow, Cpdecreases as M∞increases. This is in direct contrast with subsonic ﬂow, where Equation (11.51) shows that Cp∝(1−M2 ∞)−1/2; hence, for subsonic ﬂow, Cpincreases as M∞increases. These trends are illustrated in Figure 12.2. Note that both results predict Cp→∞ asM∞→1 from either side. However, keep in mind that neither Equation (12.15) nor (11.51) is valid inthe transonic range around Mach 1. Figure 12.2 Variation of the linearized pressure coefﬁcient with Mach number (schematic).816 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 12.3 APPLICATION TO SUPERSONIC AIRFOILS Equation (12.15) is very handy for estimating the lift and wave drag for thin super- sonic airfoils, such as sketched in Figure 12.3. When applying Equation (12.15)to any surface, one can follow a formal sign convention for θ, which is different for regions of left-running waves (such as above the airfoil in Figure 12.3) thanfor regions of right-running waves (such as below the airfoil in Figure 12.3).This sign convention is developed in detail in Reference 21. However, for ourpurpose here, there is no need to be concerned about the sign associated with θ in Equation (12.15). Rather, keep in mind that when the surface is inclined into the freestream direction, linearized theory predicts a positive C p. For example, points AandBin Figure 12.3 are on surfaces inclined into the freestream, and hence Cp,AandCp,Bare positive values given by Cp,A=2θA/radicalbig M2 ∞−1and Cp,B=2θB/radicalbig M2 ∞−1 In contrast, when the surface is inclined away from the freestream direction, lin- earized theory predicts a negative Cp. For example, points CandDin Figure 12.3 are on surfaces inclined away from the freestream, and hence Cp,CandCp,Dare negative values, given by Cp,C=−2θC/radicalbig M2 ∞−1and Cp,D=−2θD/radicalbig M2 ∞−1 Figure 12.3 Linearized supersonic ﬂow over an airfoil.CHAPTER 12 Linearized Supersonic Flow 817 /H9251 M/H11009c ypu plx Figure 12.4 A ﬂat plate at angle of attack in a supersonic ﬂow. In the above expressions, θis always treated as a positive quantity, and the sign of Cpis determined simply by looking at the body and noting whether the surface is inclined into or away from the freestream. With the distribution of Cpover the airfoil surface given by Equation (12.15), the lift and drag coefﬁcients, clandcd, respectively, can be obtained from the integrals given by Equations (1.15) to (1.19). Let us consider the simplest possible airfoil, namely, a ﬂat plate at a small angle of attack αas shown in Figure 12.4. Looking at this picture, the lower surface of the plate is a compression surface inclined at the angle αinto the freestream, and from Equation (12.15), Cp,l=2α/radicalbig M2 ∞−1(12.16) Since the surface inclination angle is constant along the entire lower surface, Cp,lis a constant value over the lower surface. Similarly, the top surface is an expansion surface inclined at the angle αaway from the freestream, and from Equation (12.15), Cp,u=−2α/radicalbig M2 ∞−1(12.17) Cp,uis constant over the upper surface. The normal force coefﬁcient for the ﬂat plate can be obtained from Equation (1.15): cn=1 c/integraldisplayc 0(Cp,l−Cp,u)dx (12.18) Substituting Equations (12.16) and (12.17) into (12.18), we obtain cn=4α/radicalbig M2 ∞−11 c/integraldisplayc 0dx=4α/radicalbig M2 ∞−1(12.19) The axial force coefﬁcient is given by Equation (1.16): ca=1 c/integraldisplayTE LE(Cp,u−Cp,l)dy (12.20) However, the ﬂat plate has (theoretically) zero thickness. Hence, in Equa- tion (12.20), dy=0, and as a result, ca=0. This is also clearly seen in818 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 12.4; the pressures act normal to the surface, and hence there is no compo- nent of the pressure force in the xdirection. From Equations (1.18) and (1.19), cl=cncosα−casinα (1.18) cd=cnsinα+cacosα (1.19) and, along with the assumption that αis small and hence cos α≈1 and sin α≈α, we have cl=cn−caα (12.21) cd=cnα+ca (12.22) Substituting Equation (12.19) and the fact that ca=0 into Equations (12.21) and (12.22), we obtain cl=4α/radicalbig M2 ∞−1(12.23) cd=4α2 /radicalbig M2 ∞−1(12.24) Equations (12.23) and (12.24) give the lift and wave-drag coefﬁcients, respec-tively, for the supersonic ﬂow over a ﬂat plate. Keep in mind that they are resultsfrom linearized theory and therefore are valid only for small α. For a thin airfoil of arbitrary shape at small angle of attack, linearized theory gives an expression for c lidentical to Equation (12.23); that is, cl=4α/radicalbig M2 ∞−1 Within the approximation of linearized theory, cldepends only on αand is inde- pendent of the airfoil shape and thickness. However, the same linearized theorygives a wave-drag coefﬁcient in the form of c d=4/radicalbig M2 ∞−1(α2+g2 c+g2 t) where gcandgtare functions of the airfoil camber and thickness, respectively. For more details, see References 25 and 26. EXAMPLE 12.1 Using linearized theory, calculate the lift and drag coefﬁcients for a ﬂat plate at a 5◦angle of attack in a Mach 3 ﬂow.

EXAMPLE 12.2 The Lockheed F-104 supersonic ﬁghter, shown in Figure 12.5, was the ﬁrst ﬁghter designedfor sustained ﬂight at Mach 2. The F-104 embodies good supersonic aircraft design—long slender fuselage, sharp pointed nose, and a wing with an extremely thin airfoil of3.4 percent thickness and a razor sharp leading edge (so sharp that a protective covering isplaced on the leading edge for ground handling). All these features have one purpose—toreduce supersonic wave drag. The planform area of the wing is 18.21 m Consider the case of the F-104 in steady, level ﬂight at Mach 2 at 11 km altitude. The weight of theairplane is at its combat weight of 9400 kg f. Assume that all the lift of the airplane comes from the lift on the wings (i.e., ignore the lift of the fuselage and tail). Calculate the angleof attack of the wing relative to the freestream. Figure 12.5 Lockheed F-104.820 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow ■Solution We ﬁrst calculate the lift coefﬁcient associated with the given ﬂight conditions, recognizing that for level ﬂight, the lift of the airplane must equal its weight: CL=L q∞S=W q∞S At an altitude of 11 km, from Appendix D, ρ∞=0.3648 kg/m3andT∞=216.78 K. Hence, a∞=/radicalbig γRT∞=/radicalbig (1.4)(287)(216.78) =295 m/s V∞=M∞a∞=(2)(295) =590 m/s q∞=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞=1 2(0.3648)(590)2=6.35×104m/s Also, the weight is given as 9400 kg f. This is an inconsistent unit of force; a newton is the consistent unit of force in the SI system. Since 1 kg f=9.8 N, we have W=(9400)(9.8) =9.212×104N CL=W q∞S=9.212×104 (6.35×104)(18.21)=0.08 We make the assumption that the lift coefﬁcient of the wing, C L, is the same as the lift coefﬁcient for the airfoil section making up the wing, cl. For subsonic ﬂight, we know from our discussion in Chapter 5 that such is not the case. For supersonic ﬂight, such isalso not the case. For a straight wing in supersonic inviscid ﬂight, however, the wing tipeffects are effectively limited to the region inside the Mach cone with its vertex at the tipleading edge. At Mach 2, the semivertex angle of the Mach cone is μ=sin −11 2=30◦. Therefore, much of the wing is unaffected by the tip effects, and experiences the two-dimensional ﬂow discussed in this chapter. The airfoil section of the F-104 is thin, and aswe will soon see, is at a small angle of attack. We conclude, therefore, that Equation (12.23)should be a good approximation for the lift coefﬁcient of the wing of the F-104. Thus, inEquation (12.23), we use c l=CL=0.08. From Equation (12.23), cl=4α/radicalbig M2∞−1 or, α=cl 4/radicalbig M2∞−1=0.08 4/radicalbig (2)2−1=0.035 rad In degrees, the wing angle of attack is α=(0.035)(57.3) =1.98◦ This is a small angle of attack, and clearly satisﬁes the small-angle approximation em-bodied in Equation (12.23). This result, which reﬂects actual ﬂight conditions of supersonic airplanes, indicates that such airplanes ﬂy at small angles of attack, for which Equations (12.23) and (12.24)are valid. Thus, the linear supersonic theory discussed in this chapter clearly has a practicalapplication.CHAPTER 12 Linearized Supersonic Flow 821 DESIGN BOX The area rule discussed in Section 11.8 can be labeled thetransonic area rule, because its proper application in an airplane design will reduce the peak drag in thetransonic ﬂight regime, allowing the airplane to morereadily achieve supersonic ﬂight. The transonic arearule calls for a smooth variation of the cross-sectionalarea of the airplane measured normal to the freestream direction. For example, the transonic area ruling of theF-16 ﬁghter is shown in Figure 12.6; here, the cross-sectional area normal to the freestream is plotted ver-sus distance along the fuselage. The area rule also applies at supersonic speeds; here, however, the relevant cross-sectional area is notthat perpendicular to the freestream relative wind, butrather the area cut by an oblique plane at the freestreamMach angle. For reduced supersonic wave drag, thesupersonic area rule calls for a smooth distribution of this oblique section area. For example, consider theF-16 ﬂying at M ∞=1.6, for which the Mach angle isμ=sin−1(1/M∞)=sin−1(1/1.6) =38.7 deg.

The variation of this oblique cross-sectional area with distance along the fuselage is shown at thetop of Figure 12.7b. Note that this area distributionis quite smooth; the F-16 design satisﬁes the super-sonic area rule at M ∞=1.6. The same holds true forM∞=1.2. The oblique cross-sectional area for μ=sin−1(1/1.2) =56.4 deg as a function of dis- tance along the fuselage is plotted at the bottom ofFigure 12.7b; a smooth distribution holds for this caseas well. Figures 12.6 and 12.7 show that the design-ers of the F-16 incorporated both the transonic andsupersonic area rules. The solid curves in Figure 12.7 show the actual area distributions for the F-16. The adjacent dashedcurves illustrate the area distributions proposed in theearly stage of the F-16 design process; based on windtunnel tests the ﬁnal conﬁguration was obtained byﬁlling and shaving areas from parts of the airplane(see Figure 12.7a) in order to more faithfully obey thesupersonic area rule.822 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Fuselage station1.6M Oblique 1.2M ObliqueYF-16Shave FillFill YF-16Proposal ProposalCross-sectional area/H9262 (a) (b) Figure 12.7 Supersonic area ruling for the F-16.

The supersonic area rule was ﬁrst conceived by the famous NACA and NASA aerodynamicist, R. T. Jones, and his work on this subject was ﬁrst pub-lished in “Theory of Wing-Body Drag at SupersonicSpeeds,” NACA TR 1284, July 8, 1953 (printed in theNACA Annual Report for 1956). This report shouldbe consulted for more details on the application of thesupersonic area rule. 12.4 VISCOUS FLOW: SUPERSONIC AIRFOIL DRAG Drag for an airfoil in low-speed ﬂow was discussed in Section 4.12. Amazingly enough, the inﬂuence of compressibility, even supersonic ﬂow, does not changethe fundamental approach to the estimation of skin-friction drag as outlined inSection 4.12—only the numbers are different. The details behind the change innumbers are given in Chapters 18 and 19. Basically, the story goes as follows. ForCHAPTER 12 Linearized Supersonic Flow 823 laminar incompressible ﬂow the ﬂat plate skin-friction drag coefﬁcient is given by Equation (4.86) as Cf=1.328√Rec(laminar incompressible) And for turbulent incompressible ﬂow approximately by Equation (4.88) as Cf=0.074 Re1/5 c(turbulent incompressible) For compressible ﬂow, the numerators of these equations are no longer constants, but rather can be viewed as functions of Mach number, the ratio of wall tem-perature to the temperature at the outer edge of the boundary layer T w/Te, and Prandtl number Pr. The Prandtl number is deﬁned as Pr =μcp/k, where μ,cp, andkare the viscosity coefﬁcient, speciﬁc heat at constant pressure, and ther- mal conductivity, respectively. The importance of Prandtl number is discussed atlength in Chapter 15. In essence, for compressible laminar ﬂow we have C f=F(Me,Pr,Tw/Te)√Rec(12.25) and for compressible turbulent ﬂow we have approximately Cf=G(Me,Pr,Tw/Te) (Re c)1/5(12.26) For a given set of values of Me, Pr, and Tw/Te, the numerical value of the numer- ators in Equations (12.25) and (12.26) are obtained from numerical solutions ofthe boundary layer equations as discussed in Chapters 18 and 19. Some classicresults are given in Figure 19.1; leap ahead and examine this ﬁgure. The results inFigure 19.1 are presented for Pr =0.75 and for the ratio T w/Tecorresponding to that for no heat transfer at the wall (an adiabatic wall). The most important phe- nomenon to observe in this ﬁgure is that C fdecreases as M ∞increases, and that the decrease is more dramatic for a turbulent boundary layer than for a laminarboundary layer. Keep in mind that, in addition to the skin-friction drag, a supersonic airfoil also experiences supersonic wave drag as discussed in Sections 9.7 and 12.3. Thesource of wave drag is the pressure distribution exerted over the airfoil surfaceand is a result of the shock-wave and expansion-wave pattern in the ﬂow overthe airfoil. The source of skin-friction drag is, of course, the shear stress exertedover the airfoil surface and is the result of friction in the ﬂow. The physicalmechanisms of wave drag and skin-friction drag clearly are quite different. Howdo these two types of drag compare in a practical ﬂow situation? The followingexample addresses this question. EXAMPLE 12.3 Consider the same Lockheed F-104 supersonic ﬁghter described in Example 12.2, with the same ﬂight conditions of Mach 2 at an altitude of 11 km. As calculated in Example 12.2,824 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow for these conditions the wing angle of attack is α=0.035 rad =1.98◦. Assume the chord length of the airfoil is 2.2 m, which is approximately the mean chord length for the wing. Also, assume fully turbulent ﬂow over the airfoil. Calculate: ( a) the airfoil skin friction drag coefﬁcient, and (b ) the airfoil wave-drag coefﬁcient. Compare the two values of drag. ■Solution (a) To calculate the skin-friction drag coefﬁcient, Cf, we need the Reynolds number. From Appendix D at 11 km, ρ∞=0.3648 kg/m3andT∞=216.78 K. The speed of sound at 11 km is therefore a∞=/radicalbig γRT∞=/radicalbig (1.4)(287)(216.78) =295 m/s Thus, V∞=M∞a∞=(2)(295) =590 m/s As discussed in Sections 1.11 and 15.3, the viscosity coefﬁcient is a function of tempera-ture. We borrow Equation (15.3), which is Sutherland’s law for the temperature variationof viscosity coefﬁcient, given by μ μ0=/parenleftbiggT T0/parenrightbigg3/2T0+110 T+110 where Tis in Kelvin, and μ0is a reference viscosity at a reference temperature, T0. We choose reference conditions to be the standard sea level values of μ0=1.7894 × 10−5kg/(m)(s) and T0=288.16 K. Thus, from Sutherland’s law, the value of μat T=216.78 K is μ=(1.7894 ×10−5)/parenleftbigg216.78 288.16/parenrightbigg3/2/parenleftbigg288.16 +110 216.78 +110/parenrightbigg =1.4226 ×10−5kg/(m)(s) The Reynolds number is Re=ρ∞V∞c μ∞=(0.3648)(590)(2.2) 1.4226 ×10−5=3.33×107 Reading Figure 19.1 very carefully, for a turbulent boundary at Mach 2 with Re =3.33× 107, we have Cf=2.15×10−3. This is for one side of a ﬂat plate. As we have done before, we assume the skin-friction drag of the thin airfoil (and recall that the airfoil on theF-104 is really thin) to be represented by that on a ﬂat plate. Since the skin-friction dragacts on both the upper and lower surface of the airfoil, we have, for the net skin-frictiondrag coefﬁcient for the F-104 airfoil, NetC f=2(2.15 ×10−3)=4.3×10−3 (b) The wave-drag coefﬁcient is given by Equation (12.24) as cd=4α2 /radicalbig M2∞−1CHAPTER 12 Linearized Supersonic Flow 825 Here,α=0.035 rad, and M∞=2. Hence cd=4(0.035)2 /radicalbig (2)2−1=2.83×10−3 From Example 12.3, we see that the total drag coefﬁcient for the supersonic airfoil iscd+Cf=2.83×10−3+4.3×10−3=7.13×10−3. The skin friction is 60 per- cent of the total drag. At the low angle of attack for the airfoil in Example 12.3,the supersonic wave drag is reasonably small, in this case smaller than the skinfriction drag. The wave drag, however, varies as the square of the angle of at-tack. For the conditions of Example 12.3, the wave drag would equal the skin-friction drag at an angle of attack of 2.47 ◦, and as the angle of attack increases above this value, the wave drag would rapidly become the dominant type ofdrag. Let us take a look at the lift-to-drag ratio, L/D, of the airfoil in Example 12.3. First of all, for an inviscid ﬂow (i.e., no friction drag), the results of Examples 12.2and 12.3 show that L D=cl cd=0.08 2.83×10−3=28.3 (inviscid) By including the skin friction drag, we have L D=cl (cd)total=0.08 7.13×10−3=11.2 Clearly, the skin-friction drag greatly diminishes the lift-to-drag ratio of the air-foil. Since the value of L/Dis an important measure of aerodynamic efﬁciency, we see the importance of trying to reduce the skin-friction drag, say by encour-aging laminar rather than turbulent boundary layers on the airfoil. Indeed, thisis essentially a generic statement that holds true across all parts of the Machnumber spectrum, from low-speed subsonic ﬂow to hypersonic ﬂow. In our dis-cussion of supersonic airfoils in this section, we can clearly see the importanceof skin-friction drag on aerodynamic performance. 12.5 SUMMARY In linearized supersonic ﬂow, information is propagated along Mach lineswhere the Mach angle μ=sin −1(1/M∞). Since these Mach lines are all based on M∞, they are straight, parallel lines which propagate away from and downstream of a body. For this reason, disturbances cannot propagate upstreamin a steady supersonic ﬂow.Anderson-3930659 book August 29, 2016 10:54 826 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow The pressure coefﬁcient, based on linearized theory, on a surface inclined at a small angle θto the freestream is Cp=2θ/radicalbig M2 ∞−1(12.15) If the surface is inclined into the freestream, Cpis positive; if the surface is inclined away from the freestream, Cpis negative. Based on linearized supersonic theory, the lift and wave-drag coefﬁcients fora ﬂat plate at an angle of attack are c l=4α/radicalbig M2 ∞−1(12.23) andcd=4α2 /radicalbig M2 ∞−1(12.24) Equation (12.23) also holds for a thin airfoil of arbitrary shape. However, forsuch an airfoil, the wave-drag coefﬁcient depends on both the shape of themean camber line and the airfoil thickness. 12.6 PROBLEMS 12.1 Using the results of linearized theory, calculate the lift and wave-dragcoefﬁcients for an inﬁnitely thin ﬂat plate in a Mach 2.6 freestream atangles of attack of(a)α=5 ◦(b)α=15◦(c)α=30◦ Compare these approximate results with those from the exact shock-expansion theory obtained in Problem 9.13. What can you concludeabout the accuracy of linearized theory in this case? 12.2 For the conditions of Problem 12.1, calculate the pressures (in the form of p/p ∞) on the top and bottom surfaces of the ﬂat plate, using linearized theory. Compare these approximate results with those obtained fromexact shock-expansion theory in Problem 9.13. Make some appropriateconclusions regarding the accuracy of linearized theory for the calculationof pressures. 12.3 Consider a diamond-wedge airfoil such as shown in Figure 9.37, with ahalf-angle ε=10 ◦. The airfoil is at an angle of attack α=15◦to a Mach 3 freestream. Using linear theory, calculate the lift and wave-dragcoefﬁcients for the airfoil. Compare these approximate results with thosefrom the exact shock-expansion theory obtained in Problem 9.14. 12.4 Equation (12.24), from linear supersonic theory, predicts that c dfor a ﬂat plate decreases as M∞increases? Does this mean that the drag force itselfCHAPTER 12 Linearized Supersonic Flow 827 decreases as M∞increases? To answer this question, derive an equation for drag as a function of M∞, and evaluate this equation. 12.5 Consider a ﬂat plate at an angle of attack in an inviscid supersonic ﬂow. From linear theory, what is the value of the maximum lift-to-drag ratio,and at what angle of attack does it occur? 12.6 Consider a ﬂat plate at an angle of attack in a viscous supersonic ﬂow; i.e.,there is both skin friction drag and wave drag on the plate. Use lineartheory for the lift and wave-drag coefﬁcients. Denote the total skin frictiondrag coefﬁcient by C f, and assume that it does not change with angle of attack. (a) Derive the expression for the angle of attack at which maximumlift-to-drag ratio occurs as a function of C fand freestream Mach number. (b) Derive the expression for the maximum lift-to-drag ratio as a functionofC fand freestream Mach number M. Answers: (a)α=(Cf)1/2(M2−1)1/4/2; (b)(cl/cd)max=(Cf)−1/2(M2−1)−1/4 12.7 Using the same ﬂight conditions and the same value of the skin-frictioncoefﬁcient from Example 12.3, and the results of Problem 12.6, calculatethe maximum lift-to-drag ratio of the ﬂat plate that is used to simulate theF-104 wing and the angle of attack at which it occurs. 12.8 The result from Problem 12.6 demonstrates that maximum lift-to-dragratio decreases as the Mach number increases. This is a fact of nature thatprogressively causes designers of supersonic airplanes grief as they strivetoward aerodynamically efﬁcient airplanes at higher supersonic Machnumbers. What physics is nature using against the airplane designer in thiscase, and how might the designer meet this challenge?CHAPTER13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for NonlinearSupersonic Flow Regarding computing as a straightforward routine, some theoreticians still tend to underestimate its intellectual value and challenge, while practitioners oftenignore its accuracy and overrate its validity. C. K. Chu, 1978Columbia University PREVIEW BOX Our discussions of compressible ﬂow have involved algebra (Chapters 7–10) and linear partial differentialequations (Chapters 11 and 12)—all tractable mathe-matics. In the process, we dealt with a number of prac-tical applications. But this is about as far as we cango with our analytical solutions allowed by tractablemathematics. For all other applications, encompass-ing the vast majority of all other real-world applica-tions, the ﬂows are governed by the more completenonlinear equations of motion, for which there are no closed-form analytical solutions. Do we throw up our hands and quit? From the title of this chapter, obviously not. Instead, we leavethe world of analytical solutions and enter the rela-tively new world of numerical solutions. Instead ofﬁnding nice, neat equations to solve our ﬂows, we aregoing to crunch numbers for our ﬂows. But we are go-ing to crunch numbers in an intelligent, often elegantfashion. We are going to start with the fundamentalnonlinear ﬂow equations of continuity, momentum,and energy obtained in Chapter 2, and solve them nu-merically for some important practical problems thatcould not be solved in any other way. Two such practical problems are addressed in this chapter. The ﬁrst is the design of the proper contour,the proper shape, of a supersonic nozzle. In Chapter 10 we studied the ﬂow properties of nozzle ﬂows, but theshape (i.e., the area-ratio distribution) of the nozzlewas always given. Look again at the rocket engineshown in Figure 10.1. How was the actual shape of 829830 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow that divergent nozzle actually designed? This is an extremely important question; if the contour of thatdivergent nozzle is not just right, undesirable shockwaves may form inside the nozzle—shock waves thatwill reduce the performance of the rocket engine. Andif you were designing the nozzle for a supersonic windtunnel, any shock waves formed inside the nozzle aregoing to ruin the type of high-quality ﬂow you wantin the test section. So the design of the proper con-tour of a supersonic nozzle is extremely important.How do you do it? You will ﬁnd the answers in thischapter. The second problem is the solution of the ﬂow around a blunt-nosed body in a supersonic ﬂow. Leapahead in this book and look at the Space Shuttle shownin Figure 14.17. What you see is a high-speed vehiclethat has a blunt nose and a wing with a blunt leadingedge. The fundamental reason for these blunt shapeswas discussed in Section 1.1 (if you have forgotten,take a quick peak at Section 1.1). In the early daysof high-speed ﬂight, the solution of the ﬂow around ablunt-nosed body in supersonic ﬂight was impossibleto obtain. And yet, it was, and still is, one of the mostimportant problems in supersonic aerodynamics. Wecall it the “supersonic blunt body problem.” Today, wecan readily solve this problem. How? You will ﬁnd theanswer in this chapter. The material in this chapter is serious business. It reﬂects modern aspects of compressible ﬂow, andgives some idea of how solutions for complex prob-lems are carried out today. Read on, and see what allthis is about. 13.1 INTRODUCTION: PHILOSOPHY OF COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS The above quotation underscores the phenomenally rapid increase in computer power available to engineers and scientists during the two decades between 1960and 1980. This explosion in computer capability is still going on, with no speciﬁclimits in sight. As a result, an entirely new discipline in aerodynamics has evolvedover the past three decades, namely, computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD). CFDis a new “third dimension” in aerodynamics, complementing the previous dimen-sions of both pure experiment and pure theory. It allows us to obtain answers toﬂuid dynamic problems which heretofore were intractable by classical analyticalmethods. Consequently, CFD is revolutionizing the airplane design process, and inmany ways is modifying the way we conduct modern aeronautical research anddevelopment. For these reasons, every modern student of aerodynamics should beaware of the overall philosophy of CFD, because you are bound to be affected byit to some greater or lesser degree in your education and professional life. The philosophy of computational ﬂuid dynamics was introduced in Sec- tion 2.17, where it was compared with the theoretical approach leading to closed-form analytical solutions. Please stop here, return to Section 2.17, and re-read thematerial presented there; now that you have progressed this far and have seen anumber of analytical solutions for both incompressible and compressible ﬂows inthe preceding chapters, the philosophy discussed in Section 2.17 will mean muchmore to you. Do this now, because the present chapter almost exclusively dealswith numerical solutions with reference to Section 2.17.2, whereas Chapters 3–12have dealt almost exclusively with analytical solutions with reference to Section2.17.1.CHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 831 In the present chapter we will experience the true essence of computational ﬂuid dynamics for the ﬁrst time in this book; we will actually see what is meant by the deﬁnition of CFD given in Section 2.17.2 as “the art of replacing theintegrals or the partial derivatives (as the case may be) in the governing equationsof ﬂuid motion with discretized algebraic forms, which in turn are solved toobtain numbers for the ﬂow ﬁeld values at discrete points in time and/or space.”However, because modern CFD is such a sophisticated discipline that is usuallythe subject of graduate level studies, and which rests squarely on the foundationsof applied mathematics, we can only hope to give you an elementary treatment inthe present chapter, but a treatment signiﬁcant enough to represent some of theessence of CFD. For your next step in learning CFD beyond the present book,you are recommended to read Anderson, Computational Fluid Dynamics: The Basics with Applications (Reference 60), which the author has written to help undergraduates understand the nature of CFD before going on to more advancedstudies of the discipline. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an introduction to some of the basic ideas of CFD as applied to inviscid supersonic ﬂows. More details are given inReference 21. Because CFD has developed so rapidly in recent years, we canonly scratch the surface here. Indeed, the present chapter is intended to give youonly some basic background as well as the incentive to pursue the subject furtherin the modern literature. The road map for this chapter is given in Figure 13.1. We begin by introduc- ing the classical method of characteristics—a numerical technique that has beenavailable in aerodynamics since 1929, but which had to wait on the modern com-puter for practical, everyday implementation. For this reason, the author classiﬁesthe method of characteristics under the general heading of numerical techniques, Figure 13.1 Road map for Chapter 13.832 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 13.2 Grid points. although others may prefer to list it under a more classical heading. We also show how the method of characteristics is applied to design the divergent contourof a supersonic nozzle. Then we move to a discussion of the ﬁnite-differenceapproach, which we will use to illustrate the application of CFD to nozzle ﬂowsand the ﬂow over a supersonic blunt body. In contrast to the linearized solutions discussed in Chapters 11 and 12, CFD represents numerical solutions to the exact nonlinear governing equations, that is, the equations without simplifying assumptions such as small perturbations, andwhich apply to all speed regimes, transonic and hypersonic as well as subsonicand supersonic. Although numerical roundoff and truncation errors are alwayspresent in any numerical representation of the governing equations, we still thinkof CFD solutions as being “exact solutions.” Both the method of characteristics and ﬁnite-difference methods have one thing in common: They represent a continuous ﬂow ﬁeld by a series of distinctgrid points in space, as shown in Figure 13.2. The ﬂow-ﬁeld properties (u ,v,p, T, etc.) are calculated at each one of these grid points. The mesh generated by these grid points is generally skewed for the method of characteristics, as shownin Figure 13.2a, but is usually rectangular for ﬁnite-difference solutions, as shownin Figure 13.2b. We will soon appreciate why these different meshes occur. 13.2 ELEMENTS OF THE METHOD OF CHARACTERISTICS In this section, we only introduce the basic elements of the method of character-istics. A full discussion is beyond the scope of this book; see References 21, 25,and 32 for more details. Consider a two-dimensional, steady, inviscid, supersonic ﬂow in xyspace, as given in Figure 13.2a. The ﬂow variables ( p,u,T, etc.) are continuous throughoutCHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 833 this space. However, there are certain lines in xyspace along which the derivatives of the ﬂow ﬁeld variables (∂ p/∂x,∂u/∂y, etc.) are indeterminate and across which may even be discontinuous. Such lines are called characteristic lines. This may sound strange at ﬁrst; however, let us prove that such lines exist, and let us ﬁnd their precise directions in the xyplane. In addition to the ﬂow being supersonic, steady, inviscid, and two-dimensional, assume that it is also irrotational. The exact governing equation for such a ﬂowis given by Equation (11.12): /bracketleftBigg 1−1 a2/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂x/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg ∂2φ ∂x2+/bracketleftBigg 1−1 a2/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂y/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg ∂2φ ∂y2−2 a2∂φ ∂x∂φ ∂y∂2φ ∂x∂y=0 (11.12) [Keep in mind that we are dealing with the full velocity potential φin Equa- tion (11.12), not the perturbation potential.] Since ∂φ/∂ x=uand∂φ/∂ y=v, Equation (11.12) can be written as /parenleftbigg 1−u2 a2/parenrightbigg∂2φ ∂x2+/parenleftbigg 1−v2 a2/parenrightbigg∂2φ ∂y2−2uv a2∂2φ ∂x∂y=0 (13.1) The velocity potential and its derivatives are functions of xandy, for example, ∂φ ∂x=f(x,y) Hence, from the relation for an exact differential, df=∂f ∂xdx+∂f ∂ydy we have d/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂x/parenrightbigg =du=∂2φ ∂x2dx+∂2φ ∂x∂ydy (13.2) Similarly, d/parenleftbigg∂φ ∂y/parenrightbigg =dv=∂2φ ∂x∂ydx+∂2φ ∂y2dy (13.3) Examine Equations (13.1) to (13.3) closely. Note that they contain the secondderivatives ∂ 2φ/∂x2,∂2φ/∂y2, and∂2φ/∂x∂y. If we imagine these derivatives as “unknowns,” then Equations (13.1), (13.2), and (13.3) represent three equationswith three unknowns. For example, to solve for ∂ 2φ/∂x∂y, use Cramer’s rule as follows: ∂2φ ∂x∂y=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1−u2 a201 −v2 a2 dx du 0 0 dv dy/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle /vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle 1−u2 a2−2uv a21−v2 a2 dx dy 0 0 dx dy/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=N D(13.4)834 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 13.3 An arbitrary direction dsaway from point A. where NandDrepresent the numerator and denominator determinants, respec- tively. The physical meaning of Equation (13.4) can be seen by considering point A and its surrounding neighborhood in the ﬂow, as sketched in Figure 13.3. The derivative ∂2φ/∂x∂yhas a speciﬁc value at point A. Equation (13.4) gives the solution for ∂2φ/∂x∂yfor an arbitrary choice of dxanddy. The combination ofdxanddydeﬁnes an arbitrary direction dsaway from point Aas shown in Figure 13.3. In general, this direction is different from the streamline directiongoing through point A. In Equation (13.4), the differentials duanddvrepresent the changes in velocity that take place over the increments dxanddy. Hence, although the choice of dxanddyis arbitrary, the values of duanddvin Equa- tion (13.4) must correspond to this choice. No matter what values of dxanddy are arbitrarily chosen, the corresponding values of duanddvwill always ensure obtaining the same value of ∂ 2φ/∂x∂yat point Afrom Equation (13.4). The single exception to the above comments occurs when dxanddyare cho- sen so that D=0 in Equation (13.4). In this case, ∂2φ/∂x∂yis not deﬁned. This situation will occur for a speciﬁc direction dsaway from point Ain Figure 13.3, deﬁned for that speciﬁc combination of dxanddyfor which D=0. However, we know that ∂2φ/∂x∂yhas a speciﬁc deﬁned value at point A. Therefore, the only consistent result associated with D=0 is that N=0, also; that is, ∂2φ ∂x∂y=N D=0 0(13.5) Here,∂2φ/∂x∂yis an indeterminate form, which is allowed to be a ﬁnite value, that is, that value of ∂2φ/∂x∂ywhich we know exists at point A.The important conclusion here is that there is some direction (or directions) through point Aalong which ∂ 2φ/∂x∂y is indeterminate. Since∂2φ/∂x∂y=∂u/∂y=∂v/∂ x, this implies that the derivatives of the ﬂow variables are indeterminate alongthese lines. Hence, we have proven that lines do exist in the ﬂow ﬁeld alongwhich derivatives of the ﬂow variables are indeterminate; earlier, we deﬁned suchlines as characteristic lines. Consider again point Ain Figure 13.3. From our previous discussion, there are one or more characteristic lines through point A.Question: How can we calculate the precise direction of these characteristic lines? The answer can be obtained bysetting D=0 in Equation (13.4). Expanding the denominator determinant inCHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 835 Equation (13.4), and setting it equal to zero, we have /parenleftbigg 1−u2 a2/parenrightbigg (dy)2+2uv a2dx dy +/parenleftbigg 1−v2 a2/parenrightbigg (dx)2=0 or/parenleftbigg 1−u2 a2/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggdy dx/parenrightbigg2 char+2uv a2/parenleftbiggdy dx/parenrightbigg char+/parenleftbigg 1−v2 a2/parenrightbigg =0 (13.6) In Equation (13.6), dy/dx is the slope of the characteristic lines; hence, the subscript “char” has been added to emphasize this fact. Solving Equation (13.6) for(dy/dx)charby means of the quadratic formula, we obtain /parenleftbiggdy dx/parenrightbigg char=−2uv/a2±/radicalbig (2uv/a2)2−4(1−u2/a2)(1−v2/a2) 2(1−u2/a2) or/parenleftbiggdy dx/parenrightbigg char=−uv/a2±/radicalbig (u2+v2)/a2−1 1−u2/a2(13.7) From Figure 13.3, we see that u=Vcosθandv=Vsinθ. Hence, Equa- tion (13.7) becomes /parenleftbiggdy dx/parenrightbigg char=(−V2cosθsinθ)/a2±/radicalBig (V2/a2)(cos2θ+sin2θ)−1 1−[(V2/a2)cos2θ](13.8) Recall that the local Mach angle μis given by μ=sin−1(1/M), or sin μ=1/M. Thus, V2/a2=M2=1/sin2μ, and Equation (13.8) becomes /parenleftbiggdy dx/parenrightbigg char=(−cosθsinθ)/sin2μ±/radicalBig (cos2θ+sin2θ)/sin2μ−1 1−(cos2θ)/sin2μ(13.9) After considerable algebraic and trigonometric manipulation, Equation (13.9)reduces to /parenleftbiggdy dx/parenrightbigg char=tan(θ∓μ) (13.10) Equation (13.10) is an important result; it states that twocharacteristic lines run through point Ain Figure 13.3, namely, one line with a slope equal to tan(θ −μ) and the other with a slope equal to tan(θ +μ). The physical signiﬁcance of this result is illustrated in Figure 13.4. Here, a streamline through point Ais inclined at the angle θwith respect to the horizontal. The velocity at point AisV, which also makes the angle θwith respect to the horizontal. Equation (13.10) states that one characteristic line at point Ais inclined below the streamline direction by the angle μ; this characteristic line is labeled as C−in Figure 13.4. Equa- tion (13.10) also states that the other characteristic line at point Ais inclined above the streamline direction by the angle μ; this characteristic line is labeled as C+in Figure 13.4. Examining Figure 13.4, we see that the characteristic lines throughpoint Aare simply the left- and right-running Mach waves through point A. Hence,836 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 13.4 Left- and right-running characteristic lines through point A. the characteristic lines are Mach lines. In Figure 13.4, the left-running Mach wave is denoted by C+, and the right-running Mach wave is denoted by C−. Hence, returning to Figure 13.2a, the characteristics mesh consists of left- and right-running Mach waves that crisscross the ﬂow ﬁeld. There are an inﬁnite numberof these waves; however, for practical calculations we deal with a ﬁnite numberof waves, the intersections of which deﬁne the grid points shown in Figure 13.2a.Note that the characteristic lines are curved in space because (1) the local Machangle depends on the local Mach number, which is a function of xandy, and (2) the local streamline direction θvaries throughout the ﬂow. The characteristic lines in Figure 13.2a are of no use to us by themselves. The practical consequence of these lines is that the governing partial differential equations that describe the ﬂow reduce to ordinary differential equations alongthe characteristic lines. These equations are called the compatibility equations, which can be found by setting N=0 in Equation (13.4), as follows. When N=0, the numerator determinant yields /parenleftbigg 1−u2 a2/parenrightbigg du dy +/parenleftbigg 1−v2 a2/parenrightbigg dx dv=0 ordv du=−(1−u2/a2) 1−v2/a2dy dx(13.11) Keep in mind that Nis set to zero only when D=0 in order to keep the ﬂow-ﬁeld derivatives ﬁnite, albeit of the indeterminate form 0/0. When D=0, we are restricted to considering directions only along the characteristic lines, as explained earlier. Hence, when N=0, we are held to the same restriction. Therefore, Equation (13.11) holds only along the characteristic lines. Therefore,CHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 837 in Equation (13.11), dy dx≡/parenleftbiggdy dx/parenrightbigg char(13.12) Substituting Equations (13.12) and (13.7) into (13.11), we obtain dv du=−1−u2/a2 1−v2/a2−uv/a2±/radicalbig (u2+v2)/a2−1 1−u2/a2 ordv du=uv/a2∓/radicalbig (u2+v2)/a2−1 1−v2/a2(13.13) Recall from Figure 13.3 that u=Vcosθandv=Vsinθ. Also, (u2+v2)/a2= V2/a2=M2. Hence, Equation (13.13) becomes d(Vsinθ) d(Vcosθ)=M2cosθsinθ∓√ M2−1 1−M2sin2θ which, after some algebraic manipulations, reduces to dθ=∓/radicalbig M2−1dV V(13.14) Examine Equation (13.14). It is an ordinary differential equation obtained from the original governing partial differential equation, Equation (13.1). However, Equation (13.14) contains the restriction given by Equation (13.12); that is, Equa-tion (13.14) holds only along the characteristic lines. Hence, Equation (13.14) gives the compatibility relations along the characteristic lines. In particular, com- paring Equation (13.14) with Equation (13.10), we see that dθ=−/radicalbig M2−1dV V(applies along the C−characteristic) (13.15) dθ=/radicalbig M2−1dV V(applies along the C+characteristic) (13.16) Examine Equation (13.14) further. It should look familiar; indeed, Equa-tion (13.14) is identical to the expression obtained for Prandtl-Meyer ﬂow inSection 9.6, namely, Equation (9.32). Hence, Equation (13.14) can be integratedto obtain a result in terms of the Prandtl-Meyer function, given by Equation (9.42).In particular, the integration of Equations (13.15) and (13.16) yields θ+ν(M)=const=K − (along the C−characteristic) (13.17) θ−ν(M)=const=K+ (along the C+characteristic) (13.18) In Equation (13.17), K−is a constant along a given C−characteristic; it has differ- ent values for different C−characteristics. In Equation (13.18), K+is a constant along a given C+characteristic; it has different values for different C+characteris- tics. Note that our compatibility relations are now given by Equations (13.17) and(13.18), which are algebraic equations which hold only along the characteristic838 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow lines. In a general inviscid, supersonic, steady ﬂow, the compatibility equations are ordinary differential equations; only in the case of two-dimensional irrotationalﬂow do they further reduce to algebraic equations. What is the advantage of the characteristic lines and their associated compat- ibility equations discussed above? Simply this—to solve the nonlinear supersonicﬂow, we need deal only with ordinary differential equations (or in the present case,algebraic equations) instead of the original partial differential equations. Findingthe solution of such ordinary differential equations is usually much simpler thandealing with partial differential equations. How do we use the above results to solve a practical problem? The purpose of the next section is to give such an example, namely, the calculation of thesupersonic ﬂow inside a nozzle and the determination of a proper wall contour sothat shock waves do not appear inside the nozzle. To carry out this calculation,we deal with two types of grid points: (1) internal points, away from the wall, and(2) wall points. Characteristics calculations at these two sets of points are carriedout as follows. 13.2.1 Internal Points Consider the internal grid points 1, 2, and 3 as shown in Figure 13.5. Assumethat we know the location of points 1 and 2, as well as the ﬂow properties atthese points. Deﬁne point 3 as the intersection of the C −characteristic through point 1 and the C+characteristic through point 2. From our previous discussion, (K−)1=(K−)3because K−is constant along a given C−characteristic. The value of (K−)1=(K−)3is obtained from Equation (13.17) evaluated at point 1: (K−)3=(K−)1=θ1+ν1 (13.19) Similarly, (K+)2=(K+)3because K+is constant along a given C+character- istic. The value of (K+)2=(K+)3is obtained from Equation (13.18) evaluated at point 2: (K+)3=(K+)2=θ2−ν2 (13.20) Figure 13.5 Characteristic mesh used for the location of point 3 and the calculation of ﬂowconditions at point 3, knowing thelocations and ﬂow properties atpoints 1 and 2.CHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 839 Now evaluate Equations (13.17) and (13.18) at point 3: θ3+ν3=(K−)3 (13.21) and θ3−ν3=(K+)3 (13.22) In Equations (13.21) and (13.22), (K−)3and(K+)3are known values, obtained from Equations (13.19) and (13.20). Hence, Equations (13.21) and (13.22) are two algebraic equations for the two unknowns θ3andν3. Solving these equations, we obtain θ3=1 2[(K−)1+(K+)2] (13.23) ν3=1 2[(K−)1−(K+)2] (13.24) Knowing θ3andν3, all other ﬂow properties at point 3 can be obtained as follows: 1.Fromν3, obtain the associated M3from Appendix C. 2.From M3and the known p0andT0for the ﬂow (recall that for inviscid, adiabatic ﬂow, the total pressure and total temperature are constantsthroughout the ﬂow), ﬁnd p 3andT3from Appendix A. 3.Knowing T3, compute a3=√γRT3. In turn, V3=M3a3. As stated earlier, point 3 is located by the intersection of the C−andC+char- acteristics through points 1 and 2, respectively. These characteristics are curvedlines; however, for purposes of calculation, we assume that the characteristics arestraight-line segments between points 1 and 3 and between points 2 and 3. For ex-ample, the slope of the C −characteristic between points 1 and 3 is assumed to be the average value between these two points, that is,1 2(θ1+θ3)−1 2(μ1+μ3). Sim- ilarly, the slope of the C+characteristic between points 2 and 3 is approximated by1 2(θ2+θ3)+1 2(μ2+μ3). 13.2.2 Wall Points In Figure 13.6, point 4 is an internal ﬂow point near a wall. Assume that we knowall the ﬂow properties at point 4. The C −characteristic through point 4 intersects the wall at point 5. At point 5, the slope of the wall θ5is known. The ﬂow properties at the wall point, point 5, can be obtained from the known properties at point 4as follows. Along the C −characteristic, K−is constant. Hence, (K−)4=(K−)5. C/H11002 /H92585 54 Figure 13.6 Wall point.840 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Moreover, the value of K−is known from Equation (13.17) evaluated at point 4: (K−)4=(K−)5=θ4+ν4 (13.25) Evaluating Equation (13.17) at point 5, we have (K−)5=θ5+ν5 (13.26) In Equation (13.26), (K−)5andθ5are known; thus ν5follows directly. In turn, all other ﬂow variables at point 5 can be obtained from ν5as explained earlier. The characteristic line between points 4 and 5 is assumed to be a straight-line segment with average slope given by1 2(θ4+θ5)−1 2(μ4+μ5). From the above discussion of both internal and wall points, we see that properties at the grid points are calculated from known properties at other grid points. Hence, in order to start a calculation using the method of characteristics, we have to know the ﬂow properties along some initial data line. Then we piece together the characteristics mesh and associated ﬂow properties by “marchingdownstream” from the initial data line. This is illustrated in the next section. We emphasize again that the method of characteristics is an exact solution of inviscid, nonlinear supersonic ﬂow. However, in practice, there are numericalerrors associated with the ﬁnite grid; the approximation of the characteristics meshby straight-line segments between grid points is one such example. In principle,the method of characteristics is truly exact only in the limit of an inﬁnite numberof characteristic lines. We have discussed the method of characteristics for two-dimensional, irrota- tional, steady ﬂow. The method of characteristics can also be used for rotationaland three-dimensional ﬂows, as well as unsteady ﬂows. See Reference 21 formore details. 13.3 SUPERSONIC NOZZLE DESIGN In Chapter 10, we demonstrated that a nozzle designed to expand a gas from rest tosupersonic speeds must have a convergent-divergent shape. Moreover, the quasi-one-dimensional analysis of Chapter 10 led to the prediction of ﬂow properties asa function of xthrough a nozzle of speciﬁed shape (see, e.g., Figure 10.10). The ﬂow properties at any xstation obtained from the quasi-one-dimensional analysis represent an average of the ﬂow over the given nozzle cross section. The beauty of the quasi-one-dimensional approach is its simplicity. On the other hand, itsdisadvantages are (1) it cannot predict the details of the actual three-dimensionalﬂow in a convergent-divergent nozzle and (2) it gives no information on the properwall contour of such nozzles. The purpose of the present section is to describe how the method of char- acteristics can supply the above information which is missing from a quasi-one-dimensional analysis. For simplicity, we treat a two-dimensional ﬂow, as sketchedin Figure 13.7. Here, the ﬂow properties are a function of xandy. Such a two- dimensional ﬂow is applicable to supersonic nozzles of rectangular cross sec-tion, such as sketched in the insert at the top of Figure 13.7. Two-dimensionalCHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 841 Figure 13.7 Schematic of supersonic nozzle design by the method of characteristics. (rectangular) nozzles are used in many supersonic wind tunnels. They are also the heart of gas-dynamic lasers (see Reference 1). In addition, there is currentdiscussion of employing rectangular exhaust nozzles on advanced military jetairplanes envisaged for the future. Consider the following problem. We wish to design a convergent-divergent nozzle to expand a gas from rest to a given supersonic Mach number at the exit M e. How do we design the proper contour so that we have shock-free, isentropic ﬂow in the nozzle? The answer to this question is discussed in the remainder ofthis section. For the convergent, subsonic section, there is no speciﬁc contour which is better than any other. There are rules of thumb based on experience and guidedby subsonic ﬂow theory; however, we are not concerned with the details here. Wesimply assume that we have a reasonable contour for the subsonic section. Due to the two-dimensional nature of the ﬂow in the throat region, the sonic line is generally curved, as sketched in Figure 13.7. A line called the limiting characteristic is sketched just downstream of the sonic line. The limiting charac- teristic is deﬁned such that any characteristic line originating downstream of thelimiting characteristic does not intersect the sonic line; in contrast, a characteristicline originating in the small region between the sonic line and the limiting charac-teristic can intersect the sonic line (for more details on the limiting characteristic,see Reference 21). To begin a method of characteristics solution, we must use aninitial data line which is downstream of the limiting characteristic.842 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Let us assume that by independent calculation of the subsonic-transonic ﬂow in the throat region, we know the ﬂow properties at all points on the limiting characteristic. That is, we use the limiting characteristic as our initial data line.For example, we know the ﬂow properties at points 1 and 2 on the limiting char-acteristic in Figure 13.7. Moreover, consider the nozzle contour just downstreamof the throat. Letting θdenote the angle between a tangent to the wall and the horizontal, the section of the divergent nozzle where θis increasing is called the expansion section, as shown in Figure 13.7. The end of the expansion section occurs where θ=θ max(point 8 in Figure 13.7). Downstream of this point, θ decreases until it equals zero at the nozzle exit. The portion of the contour whereθdecreases is called the straightening section. The shape of the expansion sec- tion is somewhat arbitrary; typically, a circular arc of large radius is used forthe expansion section of many wind-tunnel nozzles. Consequently, in additionto knowing the ﬂow properties along the limiting characteristic, we also have anexpansion section of speciﬁed shape; that is, we know θ 1,θ5, andθ8in Figure 13.7. The purpose of our application of the method of characteristics now becomes theproper design of the contour of the straightening section (from points 8 to 13 inFigure 13.7). The characteristics mesh sketched in Figure 13.7 is very coarse—this is done intentionally to keep our discussion simple. In an actual calculation, the meshshould be much ﬁner. The characteristics mesh and the ﬂow properties at theassociated grid points are calculated as follows: 1.Draw a C −characteristic from point 2, intersecting the centerline at point 3. Evaluating Equation (13.17) at point 3, we have θ3+ν3=(K−)3 In the above equation, θ3=0 (the ﬂow is horizontal along the centerline). Also,(K−)3is known because (K−)3=(K−)2. Hence, the above equation can be solved for ν3. 2.Point 4 is located by the intersection of the C−characteristic from point 1 and the C+characteristic from point 3. In turn, the ﬂow properties at the internal point 4 are determined as discussed in the last part of Section 13.2. 3.Point 5 is located by the intersection of the C+characteristic from point 4 with the wall. Since θ5is known, the ﬂow properties at point 5 are determined as discussed in Section 13.2 for wall points. 4.Points 6 through 11 are located in a manner similar to the above, and the ﬂow properties at these points are determined as discussed before, using theinternal point or wall point method as appropriate. 5.Point 12 is a wall point on the straightening section of the contour. Thepurpose of the straightening section is to cancel the expansion wavesgenerated by the expansion section. Hence, there are no waves which arereﬂected from the straightening section. In turn, no right-running wavescross the characteristic line between points 9 and 12. As a result, theCHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 843 characteristic line between points 9 and 12 is a straight line, along which θ is constant, that is, θ12=θ9. The section of the wall contour between points 8 and 12 is approximated by a straight line with an average slope of 1 2(θ8+θ12). 6.Along the centerline, the Mach number continuously increases. Let us assume that at point 11, the design exit Mach number Meis reached. The characteristic line from points 11 to 13 is the last line of the calculation.Again, θ 13=θ11, and the contour from point 12 to point 13 is approximated by a straight-line segment with an average slope of1 2(θ12+θ13). The above description is intended to give you a “feel” for the application of the method of characteristics. If you wish to carry out an actual nozzle design,and/or if you are interested in more details, read the more complete treatments inReferences 21 and 32. Note in Figure 13.7 that the nozzle ﬂow is symmetrical about the centerline. Hence, the points below the centerline (1 /prime,2/prime,3/prime, etc.) are simply mirror images of the corresponding points above the centerline. In making a calculation of theﬂow through the nozzle, we need to concern ourselves only with those points inthe upper half of Figure 13.7, above and on the centerline. 13.4 ELEMENTS OF FINITE-DIFFERENCE METHODS The method of characteristics described in the previous section legitimately canbe considered a part of computational ﬂuid dynamics because it uses discrete al-gebraic forms of the governing equations [such as Equations (13.17) and (13.18)]which are solved at discrete points in the ﬂow (the characteristic mesh illustrated inFigure 13.5). However, most authors consider that CFD is represented by mainlyﬁnite difference and ﬁnite volume techniques, such as are discussed in Refer-ence 60, and the method of characteristics is usually not included in the studyof CFD. The purpose of this section is to give you the ﬂavor of ﬁnite-differencetechniques by describing one particular method that is readily applicable to a num-ber of compressible ﬂow problems. The method discussed here is representativeof mainstream CFD, but it is just the tip of the iceberg of CFD. The intensiveresearch in CFD since 1960 has produced a multitude of different algorithmsand philosophies, and it is far beyond the scope of this book to go into the de-tails of such work. See Reference 60 for an in-depth presentation of CFD at theintroductory level. In addition, you are strongly encouraged to read the currentliterature in this regard, in particular the AIAA Journal, Computers and Fluids, and the Journal of Computational Physics. Finally, in this chapter we are dealing with numerical solutions of inviscid supersonic ﬂows. See Reference 21 for an expanded discussion of ﬁnite difference methods applied to supersonic ﬂows. First, recall the discrete ﬁnite difference representations for partial derivatives that were derived in Section 2.17.2 using Taylors series. In particular, we recallEquations (2.168), (2.171), and (2.174), repeated and renumbered, respectively,844 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow below for convenience: /parenleftbigg∂u ∂x/parenrightbigg i,j=ui+1,j−ui,j /Delta1x(forward difference) (13.27) /parenleftbigg∂u ∂x/parenrightbigg i,j=ui,j−ui−1,j /Delta1x(rearward difference) (13.28) /parenleftbigg∂u ∂x/parenrightbigg i,j=ui+1,j−ui−1,j 2/Delta1x(central difference) (13.29) Analogous expressions for the derivatives in the ydirection are as follows: /parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg i,j=⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ui,j+1−ui,j /Delta1y(forward difference) ui,j−ui,j−1 /Delta1y(rearward difference) ui,j+1−ui,j−1 2/Delta1y(central difference) How do we use the ﬁnite differences obtained here? Imagine that a ﬂow in xyspace is covered by the mesh shown in Figure 13.2b. Assume there are N grid points. At each one of these grid points, evaluate the continuity, momen- tum, and energy equations with their partial derivatives replaced by the ﬁnite-difference expressions derived above. For example, replacing the derivatives inEquations (7.40), (7.42 aandb), and (7.44) with ﬁnite differences, along with Equations (7.1) and (7.6 a), we obtain a system (over all Ngrid points) of 6 Nsi- multaneous nonlinear algebraic equations in terms of the 6 Nunknowns, namely, ρ,u,v,p,T, and e, at each of the Ngrid points. In principle, we could solve this system for the unknown ﬂow variables at all the grid points. In practice, this iseasier said than done. There are severe problems in solving such a large numberof simultaneous nonlinear equations. Moreover, we have to deal with problemsassociated with numerical instabilities that sometimes cause such attempted so-lutions to “blow up” on the computer. Finally, and most importantly, we mustproperly account for the boundary conditions. These considerations make allﬁnite-difference solutions a nontrivial endeavor. As a result, a number of special-ized ﬁnite-difference techniques have evolved, directed at solving different typesof ﬂow problems and attempting to increase computational efﬁciency and accu-racy. It is beyond the scope of this book to describe these difference techniquesin detail. However, one technique in particular was widely used during the 1970sand 1980s. This is an approach developed in 1969 by Robert MacCormack atthe NASA Ames Research Center. Because of its widespread use and acceptanceat the time, as well as its relative simplicity, we will describe MacCormack’stechnique in enough detail to give you a reasonable understanding of the method.This description will be carried out in the context of the following example. Consider the two-dimensional supersonic ﬂow through the divergent duct shown in Figure 13.8a. Assume the ﬂow is supersonic at the inlet, and that allCHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 845 (1, 1) 1.0 0(1, 2)(1, 3)(1, 4)(1, 5)(2, 5)Flow (2, 4) yys /H11005 f(x) (i, j /H11001 1) (i, j /H11001 1) (i, j /H11002 1) (i, j /H11002 1) (i /H11001 1, j) (i /H11001 1, j) (i, j) (i, j)x(2, 3) (2, 2) (2, 1) (1, 2) (1, 1)(1, 3)(1, 4)(1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 2) (2, 1)(a) Physical plane (b) Computational plane/H9264/H9257/H9004/H9257/H9257 /H11005 constant /H9004/H9264 Figure 13.8 Finite-difference meshes in both the physical and computational planes. properties are known at the inlet. That is, the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables at grid points (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4), and (1,5)are known. The duct is formed by a ﬂat surface at the bottom and a speciﬁed contour, ys=f(x), at the top. In addition, assume that the ﬂow is inviscid, adiabatic, and steady, and with no body forces.It can be rotational or irrotational—the method of solution is the same. Thegoverning equations are obtained from Equations (7.40), (7.42 aandb), (7.44), (7.1), and (7.6 a), which yield ∂(ρu) ∂x+∂(ρv) ∂y=0 (13.30) ρu∂u ∂x+ρv∂u ∂y=−∂p ∂x(13.31) ρu∂v ∂x+ρv∂v ∂y=−∂p ∂y(13.32) ρu∂(e+V2/2) ∂x+ρv∂(e+V2/2) ∂y=−∂(pu) ∂x−∂(pv) ∂y(13.33) p=ρRT (13.34) e=cvT (13.35)846 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Let us express these equations in slightly different form, as follows. Multiplying Equation (13.30) by u, and adding the results to Equation (13.31), we have u∂(ρu) ∂x+ρu∂u ∂x+u∂(ρv) ∂y+ρv∂u ∂y=−∂p ∂x or∂(ρu2) ∂x+∂(ρuv) ∂y=−∂p ∂x or∂ ∂x(ρu2+p)=−∂(ρuv) ∂y(13.36) Similarly, multiplying Equation (13.30) by v, and adding the result to Equa- tion (13.32), we obtain ∂(ρuv) ∂x=−∂(ρv2+p) ∂y(13.37) Multiplying Equation (13.30) by e+V2/2, and adding the result to Equa- tion (13.33), we obtain ∂ ∂x/bracketleftbigg ρu/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg +pu/bracketrightbigg =−∂ ∂y/bracketleftbigg ρv/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg +pv/bracketrightbigg (13.38) Deﬁne the following symbols: F=ρu (13.39a) G=ρu2+p (13.39b) H=ρuv (13.39c) K=ρu/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg +pu (13.39d) Then, Equations (13.30) and (13.36) to (13.38) become ∂F ∂x=−∂(ρv) ∂y(13.40) ∂G ∂x=−∂(ρuv) ∂y(13.41) ∂H ∂x=−∂(ρv2+p) ∂y(13.42) ∂K ∂x=−∂ ∂y/bracketleftbigg ρv/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg +pv/bracketrightbigg (13.43) Equations (13.40) to (13.43) are the continuity, xandymomentum, and energy equations, respectively—but in a slightly different form from those we are usedCHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 847 to seeing. The above form of these equations is frequently called the conservation form. Let us now treat F,G,H, and Kas our primary dependent variables; these quantities are called ﬂux variables, in contrast to the usual p,ρ,T,u,v,e, etc., which are called primitive variables. It is important to note that once the values ofF,G,H, and Kare known at a given grid point, the primitive variables at that point can be found from Equations (13.39 atod) and p=ρRT (13.44) e=cvT (13.45) V2=u2+v2(13.46) That is, Equations (13.39 atod) and (13.44) to (13.46) constitute seven algebraic equations for the seven primitive variables, ρ,u,v,p,e,T, and V. Let us return to the physical problem given in Figure 13.8 a. Because the duct diverges, it is difﬁcult to deal with an orthogonal, rectangular mesh; rather, a mesh which conforms to the boundary of the system will be curved, as shownin Figure 13.8a. On the other hand, to use our ﬁnite-difference quotients as givenin Equation (13.27), (13.28), or (13.29), we desire a rectangular computationalmesh. Therefore, we must transform the curved mesh shown in Figure 13.8a, known as the physical plane, to a rectangular mesh shown in Figure 13.8b, known as the computational plane. This transformation can be carried out as follows. Deﬁne ξ=x (13.47a) η=y ys where ys=f(x) (13.47b) In the above transformation, ηranges from 0 at the bottom wall to 1.0 at the top wall. In the computational plane (Figure 13.8b), η=constant is a straight horizontal line, whereas in the physical plane, η=constant corresponds to the curved line shown in Figure 13.8. Because we wish to apply our ﬁnite differencesin the computational plane, we need the governing equations in terms of ξand ηrather than xandy. To accomplish this transformation, apply the chain rule of differentiation, using Equations (13.47 aandb) as follows: ∂ ∂x=∂ ∂ξ∂ξ ∂x+∂ ∂η∂η ∂x=∂ ∂ξ−y y2 sdys dx∂ ∂η or∂ ∂x=∂ ∂ξ−/parenleftbiggη ysdys dx/parenrightbigg∂ ∂η(13.48) and∂ ∂y=∂ ∂ξ∂ξ ∂y+∂ ∂η∂η ∂y=1 ys∂ ∂η(13.49)848 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Using Equations (13.48) and (13.49), we see that Equations (13.40) to (13.43) become ∂F ∂ξ=/parenleftbiggη ysdys dx/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg∂F ∂η/parenrightbigg −1 ys∂(ρv) ∂η(13.50) ∂G ∂ξ=/parenleftbiggη ysdys dx/parenrightbigg∂G ∂η−1 ys∂(ρuv) ∂η(13.51) ∂H ∂ξ=/parenleftbiggη ysdys dx/parenrightbigg∂H ∂η−1 ys∂(ρv2+p) ∂η(13.52) ∂K ∂ξ=/parenleftbiggη ysdys dx/parenrightbigg∂K ∂η−1 ys∂ ∂η/bracketleftbigg ρv/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg +pv/bracketrightbigg (13.53) Note in the above equations that the ξderivatives are on the left and the ηderiva- tives are all grouped on the right. Let us now concentrate on obtaining a numerical, ﬁnite-difference solution of the problem shown in Figure 13.8. We will deal exclusively with the computationalplane, Figure 13.8b, where the governing continuity, xandymomentum, and energy equations are given by Equations (13.50) to (13.53), respectively. Gridpoints (1,1),(2,1),(1,2),(2,2), etc., in the computational plane are the same as grid points (1,1),(2,1),(1,2),(2,2), etc., in the physical plane. All the ﬂow variables are known at the inlet, including F,G,H, and K. The solution for the ﬂow variables downstream of the inlet can be found by using MacCormack’smethod, which is based on Taylor’s series expansions for F,G,H, and Kas follows: F i+1,j=Fi,j+/parenleftbigg∂F ∂ξ/parenrightbigg ave/Delta1ξ (13.54a) Gi+1,j=Gi,j+/parenleftbigg∂G ∂ξ/parenrightbigg ave/Delta1ξ (13.54b) Hi+1,j=Hi,j+/parenleftbigg∂H ∂ξ/parenrightbigg ave/Delta1ξ (13.54c) Ki+1,j=Ki,j+/parenleftbigg∂K ∂ξ/parenrightbigg ave/Delta1ξ (13.54d) In Equations (13.54 atod),F,G,H, and Kat point (i,j)are considered known, and these equations are used to ﬁnd F,G,H, and Kat point (i+1,j)assum- ing that we can calculate the values of (∂F/∂ξ) ave,(∂G/∂ξ) ave, etc. The main thrust of MacCormack’s method is the calculation of these average derivatives.Examining Equations (13.54 atod), we ﬁnd that this ﬁnite-difference method is clearly a “down-stream marching” method; given the ﬂow at point (i,j)we use Equations (13.54 atod) to ﬁnd the ﬂow at point (i+1,j). Then the process is repeated to ﬁnd the ﬂow at point (i+2,j), etc. This downstream marching is similar to that performed with the method of characteristics.CHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 849 The average derivatives in Equations (13.54 atod) are found by means of a straightforward “predictor-corrector” approach, outlined below. In carrying out this approach, we assume that the ﬂow properties are known at grid point (i,j), as well as at all points directly above and below (i,j), namely, at (i,j+1), (i,j+2),(i,j−1),(i,j−2), etc. 13.4.1 Predictor Step First, predict the value of Fi+1,jby using a Taylor series where ∂F/∂ξis evaluated at point (i,j). Denote this predicted value by ¯Fi+1,j: ¯Fi+1,j=Fi,j+/parenleftbigg∂F ∂ξ/parenrightbigg i,j/Delta1ξ (13.55) In Equation (13.55), (∂F/∂ξ) i,jis obtained from the continuity equation, Equa- tion (13.50), using forward differences for the ηderivatives; that is, /parenleftbigg∂F ∂ξ/parenrightbigg i,j=/parenleftbiggη ysdys dx/parenrightbigg i,j/parenleftbiggFi,j+1−Fi,j /Delta1η/parenrightbigg −1 ys/bracketleftbigg(ρv) i,j+1−(ρv) i,j /Delta1η/bracketrightbigg (13.56) In Equation (13.56), all quantities on the right-hand side are known and allowthe calculation of (∂F/∂ξ) i,jwhich is, in turn, inserted into Equation (13.55). A similar procedure is used to ﬁnd predicted values of G,H, and K, namely, ¯Gi+1,j, ¯Hi+1,j, and ¯Ki+1,j, using forward differences in Equations (13.51) to (13.53). In turn, predicted values of the primitive variables, ¯pi+1,j,¯ρi+1,j, etc., can be obtained from Equations (13.39 atod) and (13.44) to (13.46). 13.4.2 Corrector Step The predicted values obtained above are used to obtain predicted values of thederivative ( ∂F/∂ξ) i+1,j, using rearward differences in Equation (13.50): /parenleftBigg ∂F ∂ξ/parenrightBigg i+1,j=/parenleftbiggη ysdys dx/parenrightbigg i+1,j¯Fi+1,j−¯Fi+1,j−1 /Delta1η−1 ys(ρv) i+1,j−(ρv) i+1,j−1 /Delta1η (13.57) In turn, the results from Equations (13.56) and (13.57) allow the calculation ofthe average derivative /parenleftbigg∂F ∂ξ/parenrightbigg ave=1 2⎡ ⎣/parenleftbigg∂F ∂ξ/parenrightbigg i,j+/parenleftBigg ∂F ∂ξ/parenrightBigg i+1,j⎤⎦ (13.58) Finally, this average derivative is used in Equation (13.54 a) to obtain the corrected value of Fi+1,j. The same process is followed to ﬁnd the corrected values of Gi+1,j, Hi+1,j, and Ki+1,jusing rearward differences in Equations (13.51) to (13.53) and calculating the average derivatives (∂G/∂ξ) ave, etc., in the same manner as Equation (13.58). The above ﬁnite-difference procedure allows the step-by-step calculation of the ﬂow ﬁeld, marching downstream from some initial data line. In the ﬂow given850 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow in Figure 13.8, the initial data line is the inlet, where properties are considered known. Although all the calculations are carried out in the transformed, com-putational plane, the ﬂow-ﬁeld results obtained at points (2,1),(2,2), etc., in the computational plane are the same values at points (2,1),(2,2), etc., in the physical plane. There are other aspects of the ﬁnite-difference solution which have not been described above. For example, what values of /Delta1ηand/Delta1ξin Equations (13.54 a tod), (13.55), (13.56), and (13.57) are allowed in order to maintain numerical stability? How is the ﬂow-tangency condition at the walls imposed on the ﬁnite-difference calculations? These are important matters, but we do not take theadditional space to discuss them here. See Chapter 11 of Reference 21 for detailson these questions. Our purpose here has been to give you only a feeling for thenature of the ﬁnite-difference method. 13.5 THE TIME-DEPENDENT TECHNIQUE: APPLICATION TO SUPERSONIC BLUNT BODIES The method of characteristics described in Section 13.2 is applicable only to su- personic ﬂows; the characteristic lines are not deﬁned in a practical fashion forsteady, subsonic ﬂow. Also, the particular ﬁnite-difference method outlined inSection 13.4 applies only to supersonic ﬂows; if it were to be used in a locallysubsonic region, the calculation would blow up. The reason for both of the abovecomments is that the method of characteristics and the steady ﬂow, forward-marching ﬁnite-difference technique depend on the governing equations beingmathematically “hyperbolic.” In contrast, the equations for steady subsonic ﬂoware “elliptic.” (See Reference 21 for a description of these mathematical classiﬁ-cations.) The fact that the governing equations change their mathematical naturein going from locally supersonic to locally subsonic ﬂow has historically causedtheoretical aerodynamicists much grief. One problem in particular, namely, themixed subsonic-supersonic ﬂow over a supersonic blunt body as described inSection 9.5, was a major research area until a breakthrough was made in thelate 1960s for its proper numerical solution. The purpose of this section is to de-scribe a numerical ﬁnite-difference solution which readily allows the calculationof mixed subsonic-supersonic ﬂows—the time-dependent method —and to show how it is used to solve supersonic blunt-body ﬂows. Time-dependent techniquesare very common in modern computational ﬂuid dynamics, and as a student ofaerodynamics, you should be familiar with their philosophy. These techniquesare also called time-marching techniques because the solutions are obtained by marching in steps of time. Consider a blunt body in a supersonic stream, as sketched in Figure 13.9a. The shape of the body is known and is given by b=b(y). For a given freestream Mach number M ∞, we wish to calculate the shape and location of the detached shock wave, as well as the ﬂow-ﬁeld properties between the shock and the body.CHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 851 Figure 13.9 Blunt-body ﬂow ﬁeld in both the physical and computational planes. The physical aspects of this ﬂow ﬁeld were described in Section 9.5, which you should review before progressing further. The ﬂow around a blunt body in a supersonic stream is rotational. Why? Examine Figure 13.10, which illustrates several streamlines around the bluntbody. The ﬂow is inviscid and adiabatic. In the uniform freestream ahead of theshock wave, the entropy is the same for each streamline. However, in crossingthe shock wave, each streamline traverses a different part of the wave, and henceexperiences a different increase in entropy. That is, the streamline at point ain Figure 13.10 crosses a normal shock, and hence experiences a large increase inentropy, whereas the streamline at point bcrosses a weaker, oblique shock, and therefore experiences a smaller increase in entropy, s b<sa. The streamline at point cexperiences an even weaker portion of the shock, and hence sc<sb<sa. The net result is that in the ﬂow between the shock and the body, the entropy along a given streamline is constant, whereas the entropy changes from one streamline852 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 13.10 In a supersonic blunt-body ﬂow ﬁeld, the entropy is different for different streamlines. to the next; that is, an entropy gradient exists normal to the streamlines. It can readily be shown (see Section 9.5.1) that an adiabatic ﬂow with entropy gradients isrotational. Hence, the ﬂow ﬁeld over a supersonic blunt body is rotational. In light of the above, we cannot use the velocity potential equation to analyze the blunt-body ﬂow. Rather, the basic continuity, momentum, and energy equa-tions must be employed in their fundamental form, given by Equations (7.40),(7.42 aandb), and (7.44). With no body forces, these equations are Continuity:∂ρ ∂t=−/parenleftbigg∂(ρu) ∂x+∂(ρv) ∂y/parenrightbigg (13.59) x momentum:∂u ∂t=−/parenleftbigg u∂u ∂x+v∂u ∂y+1 ρ∂p ∂x/parenrightbigg (13.60) y momentum:∂v ∂t=−/parenleftbigg u∂v ∂x+v∂v ∂y+1 ρ∂p ∂y/parenrightbigg (13.61) Energy:∂(e+V2/2) ∂t=−/parenleftbigg u∂(e+V2/2) ∂x+v∂(e+V2/2) ∂y(13.62) +1 ρ∂(pu) ∂x+1 ρ∂(pv) ∂y/parenrightbigg Notice the form of the above equations; the time derivatives are on the left, andall spatial derivatives are on the right. These equations are in the form necessaryfor a time-dependent ﬁnite-difference solution, as described below. Return to Figure 13.9a. Recall that the body shape and freestream conditions are given, and we wish to calculate the shape and location of the shock wave asCHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 853 Figure 13.11 Schematic of the time variation of a typical ﬂow variable—the time-dependent method. well as the ﬂow ﬁeld between the shock and body. We are interested in the steady ﬂow over the blunt body; however, we use a time-dependent method to obtain the steady ﬂow. The basic philosophy of this method is as follows. First, assume a shock-wave shape and location. Also, cover the ﬂow ﬁeld between the shock and body with a series of grid points, as sketched in Figure 13.9a. At each of these gridpoints, assume values of all the ﬂow variables, ρ,u,v, etc. These assumed values are identiﬁed as initial conditions at time t=0. With these assumed values, the spatial derivatives on the right sides of Equations (13.59) to (13.62) are knownvalues (obtained from ﬁnite differences). Hence, Equations (13.59) to (13.62)allow the calculation of the time derivatives ∂ρ/∂ t,∂u/∂t, etc. In turn, these time derivatives allow us to calculate the ﬂow properties at each grid point at a laterinstant in time, say, /Delta1t. The ﬂow properties at time t=/Delta1tare different from at t=0. A repetition of this cycle gives the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables at all grid points at time t=2/Delta1t. As this cycle is repeated many hundreds of times, the ﬂow-ﬁeld properties at each grid point are calculated as a function of time. For example,the time variation of u i,jis sketched in Figure 13.11. At each time step, the value ofui,jis different; however, at large times the changes in ui,jfrom one time step to another become small, and ui,japproaches a steady-state value, as shown in Figure 13.11. It is this steady-state value that we want; the time-dependent approach is simply a means to that end. Moreover, the shock-wave shape and location will change with time; the new shock location and shape at each timestep are calculated so as to satisfy the shock relations across the wave at eachof the grid points immediately behind the wave. At large times, as the ﬂow-ﬁeldvariables approach a steady state, the shock shape and location also approach asteady state. Because of the time-dependent motion of the shock wave, the waveshape is a function of both tandyas shown in Figure 13.9a, s=s(y,t). Given this philosophy, let us examine a few details of the method. First, note that the ﬁnite-difference grid in Figure 13.9a is curved. We would like to apply our ﬁnite differences in a rectangular grid; hence, in Equations (13.59) to (13.62)the independent variables can be transformed as ξ=x−b s−bandη=y854 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow where b=b(y)gives the abscissa of the body and s=s(y,t)gives the abscissa of the shock. The above transformation produces a rectangular grid in the compu- tational plane, shown in Figure 13.9b, where the body corresponds to ξ=0 and the shock corresponds to ξ=1. All calculations are made in this transformed, computational plane. The ﬁnite-difference calculations themselves can be carried out using MacCormack’s method (see Section 13.4) applied as follows. The ﬂow-ﬁeld vari-ables can be advanced in time using a Taylor series in time; for example, ρ i,j(t+/Delta1t)=ρi,j(t)+/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbigg∂ρ ∂t/parenrightbigg i,j/bracketrightBigg ave/Delta1t (13.63) In Equation (13.63), we know the density at grid point (i,j)at time t; that is, we know ρi,j(t). Then Equation (13.63) allows us to calculate the density at the same grid point at time t+/Delta1t, that is, ρi,j(t+/Delta1t),ifwe know a value of the average time derivative [(∂ρ/∂ t)i,j]ave. This time derivative is an average between times tandt+/Delta1tand is obtained from a predictor-corrector process as follows. 13.5.1 Predictor Step All the ﬂow variables are known at time tat all the grid points. This allows us to replace the spatial derivatives on the right of Equations (13.59) to (13.62) (suitablytransformed into ξηspace) with known forward differences. These equations then give values of the time derivatives at time t, which are used to obtain predicted values of the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables at time t+/Delta1t; for example, ¯ρ i,j(t+/Delta1t)=ρi,j(t)+/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbigg∂ρ ∂t/parenrightbigg i,j/bracketrightBigg t/Delta1t where ρi,j(t)is known, [(∂ρ/∂ t)i,j]tis obtained from the governing equation, Equation (13.59) (suitably transformed), using forward differences for the spatial derivatives, and ¯ ρi,j(t+/Delta1t)is the predicted density at time t+/Delta1t. Predicted values of all other ﬂow variables ¯ui,j(t+/Delta1t), etc., are obtained at all the grid points in a likewise fashion. 13.5.2 Corrector Step Inserting the ﬂow variables obtained above into the governing equations, Equa-tions (13.59) to (13.62), using rearward differences for the spatial derivatives, predicted values of the time derivatives at t+/Delta1tare obtained, for example, [( ∂ρ/∂ t)i,j](t+/Delta1t). In turn, these are averaged with the time derivatives from the predictor step to obtain; for example, /bracketleftBigg/parenleftbigg∂ρ ∂t/parenrightbigg i,j/bracketrightBigg ave=1 2⎧ ⎨ ⎩/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbigg∂ρ ∂t/parenrightbigg i,j/bracketrightBigg t+⎡⎣/parenleftBigg ∂ρ ∂t/parenrightBigg i,j⎤⎦ (t+/Delta1t)⎫ ⎬ ⎭(13.64)CHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 855 Finally, the average time derivative obtained from Equation (13.64) is inserted into Equation (13.63) to yield the corrected value of density at time t+/Delta1t. The same procedure is used for all the dependent variables, u,v, etc. Starting from the assumed initial conditions at t=0, the repeated appli- cation of Equation (13.63) along with the above predictor-corrector algorithmat each time step allows the calculation of the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables and shockshape and location as a function of time. As stated above, after a large numberof time steps, the calculated ﬂow-ﬁeld variables approach a steady state, where[(∂ρ/∂ t) i,j]ave→0 in Equation (13.63). Once again, we emphasize that we are interested in the steady-state answer, and the time-dependent technique is simplya means to that end. Note that the applications of MacCormack’s technique to both the steady ﬂow calculations described in Section 13.4 and the time-dependent calculationsdescribed in the present section are analogous; in the former, we march forwardin the spatial coordinate x, starting with known values along with a constant y line, whereas in the latter, we march forward in time starting with a known ﬂowﬁeld at t=0. Why do we bother with a time-dependent solution? Is it not an added com- plication to deal with an extra independent variable tin addition to the spatial variables xandy? The answers to these questions are as follows. The governing unsteady ﬂow equations given by Equations (13.59) to (13.62) are hyperbolic withrespect to time, independent of whether the ﬂow is locally subsonic or supersonic.In Figure 13.9a, some of the grid points are in the subsonic region and others arein the supersonic region. However, the time-dependent solution progresses in thesame manner at all these points, independent of the local Mach number. Hence,the time-dependent technique is the only approach known today which allows theuniform calculation of a mixed subsonic-supersonic ﬂow ﬁeld of arbitrary extent.For this reason, the application of the time-dependent technique, although it addsone additional independent variable, allows the straightforward solution of a ﬂowﬁeld which is extremely difﬁcult to solve by a purely steady-state approach. A much more detailed description of the time-dependent technique is given in Chapter 12 of Reference 21, and especially in Reference 7, which you shouldstudy before attempting to apply this technique to a speciﬁc problem. The intentof our description here has been to give you simply a “feeling” for the philosophyand general approach of the technique. Some typical results for supersonic blunt-body ﬂow ﬁelds are given in Fig- ures 13.12 to 13.15. These results were obtained with a time-dependent solutiondescribed in Reference 33. Figures 13.12 and 13.13 illustrate the behavior of atime-dependent solution during its approach to the steady state. In Figure 13.12,the time-dependent motion of the shock wave is shown for a parabolic cylinderin a Mach 4 freestream. The shock labeled 0 /Delta1tis the initially assumed shock wave at t=0. At early times, the shock wave rapidly moves away from the body; however, after about 300 time steps, it has slowed considerably, and between300 and 500 time steps, the shock wave is virtually motionless—it has reachedits steady-state shape and location. The time variation of the stagnation point856 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Sonic point2.0 2.0 0/H110021.0 0500 /H9004t200 /H9004t 100 /H9004t0 /H9004t 400 /H9004t 300 /H9004t 1.0 2.0y x Figure 13.12 Time-dependent shock-wave motion, parabolic cylinder, M∞=4. Figure 13.13 Time variation of stagnation point pressure, parabolic cylinder, M∞=4. pressure is given in Figure 13.13. Note that the pressure shows strong timewise oscillations at early times, but then it asymptotically approaches a steady valueat large times. Again, it is this asymptotic steady state that we want, and theintermediate transient results are just a means to that end. Concentrating on justthe steady-state results, Figure 13.14 gives the pressure distribution (nondimen-sionalized by stagnation point pressure) over the body surface for the cases ofCHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 857 Figure 13.14 Surface pressure distributions, parabolic cylinder. Figure 13.15 Shock shapes and sonic lines, parabolic cylinder. both M∞=4 and 8. The time-dependent numerical results are shown as the solid curves, whereas the open symbols are from newtonian theory, to be discussed in Chapter 14. Note that the pressure is a maximum at the stagnation point anddecreases as a function of distance away from the stagnation point—a variationthat we most certainly would expect based on our previous aerodynamic experi-ence. The steady shock shapes and sonic lines are shown in Figure 13.15 for thecases of M ∞=4 and 8. Note that as the Mach number increases, the shock wave moves closer to the body.858 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 13.6 FLOW OVER CONES Return to Section 9.3 and review the comparison between the supersonic ﬂow over a wedge and that over a right-circular cone at zero angle of attack. In par-ticular, examine again Figure 9.16, which illustrates the Mach 2 ﬂow over a 20 ◦ half-angle wedge and over a 20◦half-angle cone. Recall that the ﬂow over the cone experiences a three-dimensional relieving effect that results in a weakershock wave, a lower surface pressure, and curved streamlines behind the shock incomparison to the purely two-dimensional ﬂow over the wedge. This ﬂow overthe cone is a special degenerate case of three-dimensional ﬂow, and is governed bynonlinear differential equations that must be solved numerically. For this reason,and also because of the fundamental importance of conical ﬂow in supersonicaerodynamics, we conclude this chapter on numerical techniques with a detaileddiscussion of such ﬂow. Moreover, the results of this section will carry over tothe next chapter when we discuss the design of hypersonic waveriders. Consider a body of revolution (a body generated by rotating a given planar curve about a ﬁxed axis) at zero angle of attack as shown in Figure 13.16. Acylindrical coordinate system ( r,/Phi1,z) is drawn, with the zaxis as the axis of symmetry aligned in the direction of V ∞. By inspection of Figure 13.16, the ﬂow ﬁeld must be symmetric about the zaxis; i.e., all properties are independent of /Phi1: ∂ ∂φ≡0 The ﬂowﬁeld depends only on randz. As ﬁrst introduced at the end of Section 6.3, such a ﬂow is deﬁned as axisymmetric ﬂow. It is a ﬂow that takes place in three-dimensional space; however, because there are only two independent variables, randz, axisymmetric ﬂow is sometimes called “quasi-two-dimensional” ﬂow. In this section, we will further specialize to the case of a sharp right-circular cone in a supersonic ﬂow, as sketched in Figure 13.17. This case is important forthree reasons. 1.The nonlinear equations of motion lend themselves to a straightforward exact, albeit numerical, solution for this case. 2.The supersonic ﬂow over a cone is of great practical importance in appliedaerodynamics; the nose cones of many high-speed missiles and projectilesare approximately conical, as are the nose regions of the fuselages of mostsupersonic airplanes. Figure 13.16 Cylindrical coordinate system for an axisymmetric body.CHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 859 Figure 13.17 Supersonic ﬂow over a cone. 3.The ﬁrst solution for the supersonic ﬂow over a cone was obtained by A. Busemann in 1929, long before supersonic ﬂow became fashionable (seeReference 93). This solution was essentially graphical, and illustrated someof the important physical phenomena. A few years later, in 1933, G. I.Taylor and J. W. Macoll (see Reference 94) presented a numerical solutionthat is a hallmark in the evolution of compressible ﬂow. Therefore, thestudy of conical ﬂow is of historical signiﬁcance. Moreover, theTaylor-Maccoll solution for the supersonic ﬂow over a cone is a classic casein inviscid supersonic aerodynamics. 13.6.1 Physical Aspects of Conical Flow Consider a sharp cone of semivertex angle θc, sketched in Figure 13.17. Assume this cone extends to inﬁnity in the downstream direction (a semi-inﬁnite cone).The cone is in a supersonic ﬂow, and hence an oblique shock wave is attachedat the vertex. The shape of this shock wave is also conical. A streamline fromthe supersonic freestream discontinuously defects as it traverses the shock, andthen curves continuously downstream of the shock, becoming parallel to thecone surface asymptotically at inﬁnity. Contrast this ﬂow with that over a two-dimensional wedge (Figure 9.16a) where all streamlines behind the shock areimmediately parallel to the wedge surface. Because the cone extends to inﬁnity, distance along the cone becomes mean- ingless: If the pressure were different at the 1- and 10-m stations along the surfaceof the cone, then what would it become at inﬁnity? This presents a dilemma thatcan be reconciled only by assuming that the pressure is constant along the surfaceof the cone, as well as that all other ﬂow properties are also constant. Since the860 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow cone surface is simply a ray from the vertex, consider other such rays between the cone surface and the shock wave, as illustrated by the dashed line in Figure 13.17.It only makes sense to assume that the ﬂow properties are constant along theserays as well. Indeed, the deﬁnition of conical ﬂow is where all ﬂow properties areconstant along rays from a given vertex. The properties vary from one ray to thenext. This aspect of conical ﬂow has been experimentally proven. Theoretically,it results from the lack of a meaningful scale length for a semi-inﬁnite cone. 13.6.2 Quantitative Formulation Consider the superimposed cartesian and spherical coordinate systems sketchedin Figure 13.18a. The zaxis is the axis of symmetry for the right-circular cone, andV ∞is oriented in the zdirection. The ﬂow is axisymmetric; properties are independent of /Phi1. Therefore, the picture can be reoriented as shown in Fig- ure 13.18b, where randθare the two independent variables and V∞is now horizontal. At any point ein the ﬂow ﬁeld, the radial and normal components of velocity are VrandVθ, respectively. Our objective is to solve for the ﬂow ﬁeld between the body and the shock wave. Recall that for axisymmetric conical ﬂow ∂ ∂θ≡0 (axisymmetric ﬂow) ∂ ∂r≡0 (ﬂow properties are constant along a ray from the vertex) The continuity equation for steady ﬂow is Equation (2.54): ∇·(ρV)=0 The divergence of a vector in spherical coordinates is given by Equation 2.21.Thus, in terms of spherical coordinates, Equation (2.54) becomes ∇·(ρV)=1 r2∂ ∂r(r2ρVr)+1 rsinθ∂ ∂θ(ρVθsinθ)+1 rsinθ∂(ρVφ) ∂φ=0 (13.65) Evaluating the derivatives, and applying the above conditions for axisymmetricconical ﬂow, we see that Equation (13.65) becomes 1 r2/bracketleftbigg r2∂(ρVr) ∂r+ρVr(2r)/bracketrightbigg +1 rsinθ/bracketleftbigg ρVθcosθ+sinθ∂(ρVθ) ∂θ/bracketrightbigg +1 rsinθ∂(ρVθ) ∂φ=0 2ρVr r+ρVθ rcotθ+1 r/parenleftbigg ρ∂Vθ ∂θ+Vθ∂ρ ∂θ/parenrightbigg =0 2ρVr+ρVθcotθ+ρ∂Vθ ∂θ+Vθ∂ρ ∂θ=0 (13.66) Equation (13.66) is the continuity equation for axisymmetric conical ﬂow.CHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 861 Figure 13.18 Spherical coordinate system for a cone. Return to the conical ﬂow ﬁeld sketched in Figures 13.17 and 13.18. The shock wave is straight, and hence the increase in entropy across the shock is the same for all streamlines. Consequently, throughout the conical ﬂow ﬁeld, ∇s=0. Moreover, the ﬂow is adiabatic and steady, and hence Equation 7.55 dictates that/Delta1h o=0. In an inviscid compressible ﬂow, entropy gradients ∇s, gradients in total enthalpy /Delta1ho, and vorticity ∇× V, are related through Crocco’s theorem, derived in Reference 21, and given here without proof: T∇s=∇ho−V×(∇× V) (13.67)862 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow For the conical ﬂow considered here, since ∇s=∇ ho=0, Equation (13.67) gives ∇× V=0 Hence, the conical ﬂow ﬁeld is irrotational. Crocco’s theorem is derived on the basis of both the momentum and energy equations. Therefore, the relation ∇× V=0 can be used in place of either one. In spherical coordinates, ∇× V=1 r2sinθ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleerreθ(rsinθ)eφ ∂ ∂r∂ ∂θ∂ ∂φ VrrVθ(rsinθ)Vφ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle =0 (13.68) where er,eθ, and eφare unit vectors in the r,θ, andφdirections, respectively.

Since the ﬂow is irrotational, we can apply Euler’s equation in any direction in the form of Equation (3.12): dp=−ρVdV where V2=V2 r+V2 θ Hence, Equation (3.12) becomes dp=−ρ(VrdVr+VθdVθ) (13.71) Recall that, for isentropic ﬂow, dp dρ≡/parenleftbigg∂p ∂ρ/parenrightbigg s=a2CHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 863 Thus, Equation (13.71) becomes dρ ρ=−1 a2(VrdVr+VθdVθ) (13.72) From Equation (7.55), and deﬁning a new reference velocity Vmaxas the maximum theoretical velocity obtainable from a ﬁxed reservoir condition (when V=Vmax, the ﬂow has expanded theoretically to zero temperature, hence h=0), we have ho=const=h+V2 2=V2 max 2 Note that Vmaxis a constant for the ﬂow and is equal to√2ho.

Equations (13.66), (13.70), and (13.74) are three equations with three depen- dent variables: ρ,Vr, and Vθ. Due to the axisymmetric conical ﬂow conditions, there is only one independent variable, namely θ. Hence, the partial derivatives in Equations (13.66) and (13.70) are more properly written as ordinary derivatives.From Equation (13.66), 2V r+Vθcotθ+dVθ dθ+Vθ ρdρ dθ=0 (13.75) From Equation (13.74), dρ dθ=−2ρ γ−1⎛ ⎜⎜⎝VrdVr dθ+VθdVθ dθ V2 max−V2 r−V2 θ⎞ ⎟⎟⎠(13.76) Substituting Equation (13.76) into Equation (13.75), 2Vr+Vθcotθ+dVθ dθ−2Vθ γ−1⎛ ⎜⎜⎝VrdVr dθ+VθdVθ dθ V2 max−V2 r−V2 θ⎞ ⎟⎟⎠=0864 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow or γ−1 2/parenleftbigV2 max−V2 r−V2 θ/parenrightbig/parenleftbigg 2Vr+Vθcotθ+dVθ dθ/parenrightbigg −Vθ/parenleftbigg VrdVr dθ+VθdVθ dθ/parenrightbigg =0 (13.77) Recall from Equation (13.70) Vθ=dVr dθ Hence, dVθ dθ=d2Vr dθ2 Substituting this result into Equation (13.77), we have γ−1 2/bracketleftBigg V2 max−V2 r−/parenleftbiggdVr dθ/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg/bracketleftbigg 2Vr+dVr dθcotθ+d2Vr dθ2/bracketrightbigg −dVr dθ/bracketleftbigg VrdVr dθ+dVr dθ/parenleftbiggd2Vr dθ2/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg =0(13.78) Equation (13.78) is the Taylor-Maccoll equation for the solution of conical ﬂows.

By this, we mean that a given shock wave will beassumed, and the particular cone that supports the given shock will be calculated.This is in contrast to the direct approach, where the cone is given and the ﬂowﬁeld and shock wave are calculated. The numerical procedure is as follows: 1.Assume a shock wave angle θ sand a freestream Mach number M∞, as sketched in Figure 13.19. From this, the Mach number and ﬂow deﬂection angle, M2andδ, respectively, immediately behind the shock can be found from the oblique shock relations. Note that, contrary to our previouspractice, the ﬂow deﬂection angle is here denoted by δso as not to confuse it with the polar coordinate θ. 2.From M 2andδ, the radial and normal components of ﬂow velocity, V/prime r andV/prime θ, respectively, directly behind the shock can be found from the geometry of Figure 13.19. Note that V/primeis obtained by inserting M2into Equation (10.16). 3.Using the above value of V/prime rdirectly behind the shock as a boundary value, solve Equation (13.81) for V/prime rnumerically in steps of θ, marching away from the shock. Here, the ﬂow ﬁeld is divided into incremental angles/Delta1θ, as sketched in Figure 13.19. The ordinary differential equation [Equation (13.80)] can be solved at each /Delta1θusing any standard numerical solution technique, such as the Runge-Kutta method. 4.At each increment in θ, the value of V /prime θis calculated from Equation (13.79). At some value of θ, namely θ=θc, we will ﬁnd V/prime θ=0. The normal component of velocity at an impermeable surface is zero. Hence, when866 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 13.19 Geometry for the numerical solution of ﬂow over a cone. V/prime θ=0 atθ=θcthenθcmust represent the surface of the particular cone that supports the shock wave of given wave angle θsat the given Mach number M∞as assumed in step 1. That is, the cone angle compatible with M∞andθsisθc. The value of V/prime ratθcgives the Mach number along the cone surface via Equation (13.81). 5.In the process of steps 1 through 4 here, the complete velocity ﬂow ﬁeld between the shock and the body has been obtained. Note that, at each point(or ray), V /prime=/radicalbig (V/prime r)2+(V/prime θ)2andMfollow from Equation (13.81). The pressure, density, and temperature along each ray can then be obtained fromthe isentropic relations, Equations (8.42), (8.43), and (8.40). If a different value of M ∞and/or θsis assumed in step 1, a different ﬂow ﬁeld and cone angle θcwill be obtained from steps 1 through 5. By a repeated series of these calculations, tables or graphs of supersonic cone properties can be generated. Such tables exist in the literature, the most common being those ofKopal (Reference 95) and Sims (Reference 96). 13.6.4 Physical Aspects of Supersonic Flow over Cones Some typical numerical results obtained from the solution in Section 13.6.3 areillustrated in Figure 13.20, which gives the shock wave angle θ sas a function of cone angle θcwith M∞as a parameter. Figure 13.20 for cones is analogous to Figure 9.9 for two-dimensional wedges; the two ﬁgures are qualitatively similar,but the numbers are different.CHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 867 Figure 13.20 θc-θs-Mdiagram for cones in supersonic ﬂow. (The top portion of the curves curls back for the strong-shock solution, which is not shown here.) Examine Figure 13.20 closely. Note that, for a given cone angle θcand given M∞, there are two possible oblique shock waves—the strong- and weak-shock solutions. This is directly analogous to the two-dimensional case discussed in Chapter 9. The weak solution is almost always observed in practice on real ﬁnitecones; however, it is possible to force the strong-shock solution by independentlyincreasing the back pressure near the base of the cone. Also note from Figure 13.20 that, for a given M ∞, there is a maximum cone angleθcmax, beyond which the shock becomes detached. This is illustrated in Fig- ure 13.21. When θc>θ cmax, there exists no Taylor-Maccoll solution as given here; instead, the ﬂow ﬁeld with a detached shock must be solved by techniques suchas those discussed in Section 13.5. In comparison to the two-dimensional ﬂow over a wedge, the three- dimensional ﬂow over a cone has an extra dimension in which to expand. This“three-dimensional relieving effect” was discussed in Section 9.3, which shouldnow be reviewed by the reader. In particular, recall from Figure 9.16 that the shockwave on a cone of given angle is weaker than the shock wave on a wedge of the868 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 13.21 Attached and detached shock waves on cones. same angle. It therefore follows that the cone experiences a lower surface pressure, temperature, density, and entropy than the wedge. It also follows that, for a given M∞, the maximum allowable cone angle for an attached shock solution is greater than the maximum wedge angle. This is clearly demonstrated in Figure 13.22. Figure 13.22 Comaparison of shock wave angles for wedges and cones at Mach 2.CHAPTER 13 Introduction to Numerical Techniques for Nonlinear Supersonic Flow 869 Figure 13.23 Some supersonic conical ﬂow ﬁelds are characterized by an isentropic compression to subsonic velocities near the cone surface. Finally, the numerical results show that any given streamline between the shock wave and cone surface is curved, as sketched in Figure 13.23, and asymp- totically becomes parallel to the cone surface at inﬁnity. Also, for most cases,the complete ﬂow ﬁeld between the shock and the cone is supersonic. However,if the cone angle is large enough, but still less than θ cmax, there are some cases where the ﬂow becomes subsonic near the surface. This case is illustrated in Fig-ure 13.23, where one of the rays in the ﬂow ﬁeld becomes a sonic line. In thiscase, we see one of the few instances in nature where a supersonic ﬂow ﬁeldis actually isentropically compressed from supersonic to subsonic velocities. Atransition from supersonic to subsonic ﬂow is almost invariably accompanied byshock waves, as discussed in Chapter 8. However, ﬂow over a cone can be anexception to this observation. 13.7 SUMMARY We have now completed both branches of our road map shown in Figure 13.1.Make certain that you feel comfortable with all the material represented by thisroad map. A short summary of the highlights is given below: For a steady, two-dimensional, irrotational, supersonic ﬂow, the characteristiclines are Mach lines, and the compatibility equations which hold along thesecharacteristic lines are θ+ν=K −(along a C−characteristic) and θ−ν=K+(along a C+characteristic) The numerical solution of such a ﬂow can be carried out by solving the compat-ibility equation along the characteristic lines in a step-by-step fashion, startingfrom an appropriate initial data line.870 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow The contour of a supersonic nozzle can be obtained by applying the method of characteristics downstream of the limiting characteristic (which is usuallydownstream of the geometric throat). The essence of ﬁnite-difference methods is to replace the partial derivatives inthe governing ﬂow equations with ﬁnite-difference quotients. For supersonicsteady ﬂows, this allows us to march downstream, starting from known dataalong an initial data line in the supersonic ﬂow. For the solution of mixedsubsonic-supersonic ﬂows, a time-dependent technique can be used whichallows us to march forward in time, starting with assumed initial conditions attime t=0 and achieving a steady-state result in the limit of large times. A popular technique for carrying out ﬁnite-difference solutions, whether forsupersonic steady ﬂow or for a time-dependent solution of mixed subsonicand supersonic ﬂow, is the straightforward predictor-corrector technique byMacCormack. 13.8 PROBLEM Note: The purpose of the following problem is to provide an exercise in carrying out a unit process for the method of characteristics. A more extensive applicationto a complete ﬂow ﬁeld is left to your speciﬁc desires. Also, an extensive practicalproblem utilizing the ﬁnite-difference method requires a large number of arith-metic operations and is practical only on a digital computer. You are encouragedto set up such a problem at your leisure. The main purpose of the present chapter isto present the essence of several numerical methods, not to burden the reader witha lot of calculations or the requirement to write an extensive computer program. 13.1 Consider two points in a supersonic ﬂow. These points are located in a cartesian coordinate system at (x 1,y1)=(0,0.0684) and(x2,y2)= (0.0121, 0), where the units are meters. At point (x1,y1):u1=639 m/s, v1=232.6 m/s, p1=1 atm, T1=288 K. At point (x2,y2):u2=680 m/s, v2=0,p2=1 atm, T2=288 K. Consider point 3 downstream of points 1 and 2 located by the intersection of the C+characteristic through point 2 and the C−characteristic through point 1. At point 3, calculate: u3,v3, p3, and T3. Also, calculate the location of point 3, assuming the characteristics between these points are straight lines.CHAPTER14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow Almost everyone has their own deﬁnition of the term hypersonic. If we were to conduct something like a public opinion poll among those present, and askedeveryone to name a Mach number above which the ﬂow of a gas should properlybe described as hypersonic there would be a majority of answers round about 5or 6, but it would be quite possible for someone to advocate, and defend,numbers as small as 3, or as high as 12. P. L. Roe,comment made in a lectureat the von Karman Institute, BelgiumJanuary 1970 PREVIEW BOX Airbreathing hypersonic ﬂight is held by many (including this author) to be the last frontier of air-vehicle design. Some progress has been made, butmuch needs to be done. The practical design of hy-personic vehicles for sustained hypersonic ﬂight inthe atmosphere will be a major challenge to the nextgeneration of aerospace engineers. Aeronautical history was made in March 2004 when the X-43 Hyper-X test vehicle, shown in Fig-ure 14.1, achieved sustained ﬂight for 11 s at Mach 6.9powered by a supersonic combustion ramjet engine(SCRAMjet). In November, another X-43 achievedsustained ﬂight at nearly Mach 10, making it thefastest airplane in history to date. At these speeds,aerodynamic heating becomes a major problem, andthe vehicle must be fabricated from special high-temperature materials. The X-43 thermal protectiondesign is shown in Figure 14.2. The two successfulﬂights of the X-43 in 2004 made aerospace engineer-ing history; for the ﬁrst time a SCRAMjet engine oper-ated successfully for a sustained period in atmosphericﬂight. After more than 40 years of research and tech-nical development, enough progress had been made toallow a successful test of the design methodology. Butso much more needs to be done to achieve truly prac-tical devices and ﬂight vehicles. That is where someof you come into the picture; perhaps you will be theones to tackle this last frontier. 871872 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 14.1 X-43 hypersonic test vehicle ( NASA). TUFI/AETB Carbon-CarbonHaynes AlloyTungsten Figure 14.2 X-43 thermal protection system. Hypersonic ﬂight of other human-made vehicles has been a reality since 1949, when a WAC Corporal rocket, boosted to high altitudes on top of a capturedGerman V-2 rocket, powered itself back into the at-mosphere at over 5000 mph at White Sands ProvingGround in New Mexico (see Reference 52). Sincethen, a whole host of space vehicles, such as the spaceshuttle and the Apollo return module have returned toEarth after entering and ﬂying through the atmosphereat large hypersonic Mach numbers, from Mach 26to Mach 36. So hypersonic aerodynamics has beenaround for a relatively long time, but for all practicalpurposes it is still a young, developing discipline. Hypersonic aerodynamics is the subject of this chapter. What is it about hypersonic ﬂows that makethem any different from supersonic ﬂows? Why is itthat they justify a separate chapter in this book? Afterall, hypersonic ﬂow is ﬂow with velocities greater thanthe speed of sound, which is the deﬁnition of super-sonic ﬂow, except that hypersonic ﬂows are movingat velocities generally a lot larger than the speed ofsound. Indeed, an old rule of thumb deﬁnes hyper-sonic ﬂow as ﬂow at Mach 5 or greater. However,there is nothing magic about Mach 5. If you were ﬂy-ing at Mach 4.99, and you accelerate to Mach 5.01,nothing new is going to happen—the ﬂow will notchange from green to red, and there will be no clap ofthunder. (In contrast, if you were ﬂying at Mach 0.99and accelerated to Mach 1.01, the ﬂow would “changefrom green to red,” i.e., the physics of the ﬂow wouldchange drastically as we have already seen, and therewould be a “clap of thunder,” the sudden occurrenceof shock waves.) So why is a distinction made be-tween hypersonic and supersonic ﬂows? The answeris that certain physical phenomena that are not so im-portant at supersonic speeds become dominant at hy-personic speeds. These phenomena are described inSection 14.2, which basically constitutes a four-pagedeﬁnition of hypersonic ﬂow. Read on, and ﬁnd outfor yourself what this is all about. Hypersonic aerodynamics is state-of-the-art aerodynamics. It is exciting, and it is fun. This chapterintroduces you to some of the special aspects and anal-yses of hypersonic ﬂow. It is just a beginning for you,but I predict that it will be an enjoyable beginning. 14.1 INTRODUCTION The history of aviation has always been driven by the philosophy of “faster and higher,” starting with the Wright brothers’ sea level ﬂights at 35 mi/h in1903, and progressing exponentially to the manned space ﬂight missions of the1960s and 1970s. The current altitude and speed records for manned ﬂight are themoon and 36,000 ft/s—more than 36 times the speed of sound—set by the Apollolunar capsule in 1969. Although most of the ﬂight of the Apollo took place inspace, outside the earth’s atmosphere, one of its most critical aspects was reentryCHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 873 into the atmosphere after completion of the lunar mission. The aerodynamic phenomena associated with very high-speed ﬂight, such as encountered duringatmospheric reentry, are classiﬁed as hypersonic aerodynamics—the subject of this chapter. In addition to reentry vehicles, both manned and unmanned, there areother hypersonic applications on the horizon, such as ramjet-powered hypersonicmissiles now under consideration by the military and the concept of a hypersonictransport, the basic technology of which is now being studied by NASA. There-fore, although hypersonic aerodynamics is at one extreme end of the whole ﬂightspectrum (see Section 1.10), it is important enough to justify one small chapterin our presentation of the fundamentals of aerodynamics. This chapter is short; its purpose is simply to introduce some basic consid- erations of hypersonic ﬂow. Therefore, we have no need for a chapter road mapor a summary at the end. Also, before progressing further, return to Chapter 1and review the short discussion on hypersonic ﬂow given in Section 1.10. For anin-depth study of hypersonic ﬂow, see the author’s book listed as Reference 52. 14.2 QUALITATIVE ASPECTS OF HYPERSONIC FLOW Consider a 15◦half-angle wedge ﬂying at M∞=36. From Figure 9.9, we see that the wave angle of the oblique shock is only 18◦; that is, the oblique shock wave is very close to the surface of the body. This situation is sketched in Figure 14.3.Clearly, the shock layer between the shock wave and the body is very thin. Suchthin shock layers are one characteristic of hypersonic ﬂow. A practical conse-quence of a thin shock layer is that a major interaction frequently occurs betweenthe inviscid ﬂow behind the shock and the viscous boundary layer on the surface.Indeed, hypersonic vehicles generally ﬂy at high altitudes where the density, henceReynolds number, is low, and therefore the boundary layers are thick. Moreover,at hypersonic speeds, the boundary-layer thickness on slender bodies is approxi-mately proportional to M 2 ∞; hence, the high Mach numbers further contribute to Shock wave Thin viscous shock layer Body surface 15/H11034M/H11009 /H11005 3618/H11034 Figure 14.3 For hypersonic ﬂow, the shock layers are thin and viscous.874 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow pp xx x xp /H11005 p/H11009 /H11005 const p/H11009M/H11009 /H11022/H11022 1 p/H11009p/H11009 M/H11009 /H11022/H11022 1 Mach wave (a) No viscous interaction (b) Viscous interactionThick boundary layerShock wave Figure 14.4 The viscous interaction on a ﬂat plate at hypersonic speeds. a thickening of the boundary layer. In many cases, the boundary-layer thickness is of the same magnitude as the shock-layer thickness, such as sketched in theinsert at the top of Figure 14.3. Here, the shock layer is fully viscous, and theshock-wave shape and surface pressure distribution are affected by such viscouseffects. These phenomena are called viscous interaction phenomena—where the viscous ﬂow greatly affects the external inviscid ﬂow, and, of course, the externalinviscid ﬂow affects the boundary layer. A graphic example of such viscous in-teraction occurs on a ﬂat plate at hypersonic speeds, as sketched in Figure 14.4.If the ﬂow were completely inviscid, then we would have the case shown in Fig-ure 14.4a, where a Mach wave trails downstream from the leading edge. Sincethere is no deﬂection of the ﬂow, the pressure distribution over the surface ofthe plate is constant and equal to p ∞. In contrast, in real life there is a bound- ary layer over the ﬂat plate, and at hypersonic conditions this boundary layercan be thick, as sketched in Figure 14.4b. The thick boundary layer deﬂects theexternal, inviscid ﬂow, creating a comparably strong, curved shock wave whichtrails downstream from the leading edge. In turn, the surface pressure from theleading edge is considerably higher than p ∞, and only approaches p∞far down- stream of the leading edge, as shown in Figure 14.4b. In addition to inﬂuencingthe aerodynamic force, such high pressures increase the aerodynamic heatingat the leading edge. Therefore, hypersonic viscous interaction can be important,and this has been one of the major areas of modern hypersonic aerodynamicresearch. There is a second and frequently more dominant aspect of hypersonic ﬂow, namely, high temperatures in the shock layer, along with large aerodynamic heat-ing of the vehicle. For example, consider a blunt body reentering the atmosphereat Mach 36, as sketched in Figure 14.5. Let us calculate the temperature in theshock layer immediately behind the normal portion of the bow shock wave. FromAppendix B, we ﬁnd that the static temperature ratio across a normal shock waveCHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 875 Figure 14.5 High-temperature shock layer. with M∞=36 is 252.9; this is denoted by Ts/T∞in Figure 14.5. Moreover, at a standard altitude of 59 km, T∞=258 K. Hence, we obtain Ts=65,248 K—an incredibly high temperature, which is more than six times hotter than the surface of the sun! This is, in reality, an incorrect value, because we have used Appendix Bwhich is good only for a calorically perfect gas with γ=1.4. However, at high temperatures, the gas will become chemically reacting; γwill no longer equal 1.4 and will no longer be constant. Nevertheless, we get the impression fromthis calculation that the temperature in the shock layer will be very high, albeitsomething less than 65,248 K. Indeed, if a proper calculation of T sis made taking into account the chemically reacting gas, we would ﬁnd that Ts≈11,000 K— still a very high value. Clearly, high-temperature effects are very important inhypersonic ﬂow. Let us examine these high-temperature effects in more detail. If we consider air at p=1 atm and T=288 K (standard sea level), the chemical composition is essentially 20 percent O 2and 80 percent N 2by volume. The temperature is too low for any signiﬁcant chemical reaction to take place. However, if we were toincrease Tto 2000 K, we would observe that the O 2begins to dissociate; that is, O2→2O 2000 K <T<4000 K If the temperature were increased to 4000 K, most of the O 2would be dissociated, and N 2dissociation would commence: N2→2N 4000 K <T<9000 K If the temperature were increased to 9000 K, most of the N 2would be dissociated, and ionization would commence: N→N++e− O→O++e−T>9000 K Hence, returning to Figure 14.5, the shock layer in the nose region of the body isa partially ionized plasma, consisting of the atoms N and O, the ions N +and O+, and electrons, e−. Indeed, the presence of these free electrons in the shock layer876 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow is responsible for the “communications blackout” experienced over portions of the trajectory of a reentry vehicle. One consequence of these high-temperature effects is that all our equations and tables obtained in Chapters 7 to 13 that depended on a constant γ=1.4 are no longer valid. Indeed, the governing equations for the high-temperature, chemicallyreacting shock layer in Figure 14.5 must be solved numerically, taking into accountthe proper physics and chemistry of the gas itself. The analysis of aerodynamicﬂows with such real physical effects is discussed in detail in Chapters 16 and 17of Reference 21; such matters are beyond the scope of this book. Associated with the high-temperature shock layers is a large amount of heat transfer to the surface of a hypersonic vehicle. Indeed, for reentry velocities, aero-dynamic heating dominates the design of the vehicle, as explained at the end ofSection 1.1. (Recall that the third historical example discussed in Section 1.1 wasthe evolution of the blunt-body concept to reduce aerodynamic heating; reviewthis material before progressing further.) The usual mode of aerodynamic heatingis the transfer of energy from the hot shock layer to the surface by means of thermalconduction at the surface; that is, if ∂T/∂nrepresents the temperature gradient in the gas normal to the surface, then q c=−k(∂T/∂n)is the heat transfer into the surface. Because ∂T/∂nis a ﬂow-ﬁeld property generated by the ﬂow of the gas over the body, qcis called convective heating. For reentry velocities associated with ICBMs (about 28,000 ft/s), this is the only meaningful mode of heat transferto the body. However, at higher velocities, the shock-layer temperature becomeseven hotter. From experience, we know that all bodies emit thermal radiation, andfrom physics you know that blackbody radiation varies as T 4; hence, radiation becomes a dominant mode of heat transfer at high temperatures. (For example, theheat you feel by standing beside a ﬁre in a ﬁreplace is radiative heating from theﬂames and the hot walls.) When the shock layer reaches temperatures on the orderof 11,000 K, as for the case given in Figure 14.5, thermal radiation from the hotgas becomes a substantial portion of the total heat transfer to the body surface.Denoting radiative heating by q r, we can express the total aerodynamic heating q as the sum of convective and radiative heating; q=qc+qr. For Apollo reentry, qr/q≈0.3, and hence radiative heating was an important consideration in the design of the Apollo heat shield. For the entry of a space probe into the atmosphereof Jupiter, the velocities will be so high and the shock-layer temperatures solarge that the convective heating is negligible, and in this case q≈q r. For such a vehicle, radiative heating becomes the dominant aspect in its design. Figure 14.6illustrates the relative importance of q candqrfor a typical manned reentry vehicle in the earth’s atmosphere; note how rapidly qrdominates the aerodynamic heating of the body as velocities increase above 36,000 ft/s. The details of shock-layerradiative heating are interesting and important; however, they are beyond thescope of this book. For a thorough survey of the engineering aspects of shock-layer radiative heat transfer, see Reference 34. In summary, the aspects of thin shock-layer viscous interaction and high- temperature, chemically reacting and radiative effects distinguish hypersonic ﬂowfrom the more moderate supersonic regime.

(Also, review the discussion surrounding Figure 1.6 beforeprogressing further.) Indeed, the thin shock layers around hypersonic bodies arethe closest example in ﬂuid mechanics to Newton’s model. Therefore, we mightexpect that results based on Newton’s model would have some applicability inhypersonic ﬂows. This is indeed the case; newtonian theory is used frequentlyto estimate the pressure distribution over the surface of a hypersonic body. Thepurpose of this section is to derive the famous newtonian sine-squared law ﬁrstmentioned in Section 1.1 and to show how it is applied to hypersonic ﬂows. Consider a surface inclined at the angle θto the freestream, as sketched in Figure 14.8. According to the newtonian model, the ﬂow consists of a large numberof individual particles which impact the surface and then move tangentially tothe surface. During collision with the surface, the particles lose their componentof momentum normal to the surface, but the tangential component is preserved.The time rate of change of the normal component of momentum equals the forceexerted on the surface by the particle impacts. To quantify this model, examine878 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Shock Body Figure 14.7 Streamlines in a hypersonic ﬂow. Figure 14.8 Schematic for newtonian impact theory. Figure 14.8. The component of the freestream velocity normal to the surface is V∞sinθ. If the area of the surface is A, the mass ﬂow incident on the surface is ρ∞(Asinθ)V∞. Hence, the time rate of change of momentum is Mass ﬂow ×change in normal component of velocity or (ρ∞V∞Asinθ)(V∞sinθ)=ρ∞V2 ∞Asin2θ In turn, from Newton’s second law, the force on the surface is N=ρ∞V2 ∞Asin2θ (14.1) This force acts along the same line as the time rate of change of momentum (i.e., normal to the surface), as sketched in Figure 14.8. From Equation (14.1), thenormal force per unit area is N A=ρ∞V2 ∞sin2θ (14.2) Let us now interpret the physical meaning of the normal force per unit areain Equation (14.2), N/A, in terms of our modern knowledge of aerodynamics. Newton’s model assumes a stream of individual particles all moving in straight,parallel paths toward the surface; that is, the particles have a completely directed,rectilinear motion. There is no random motion of the particles—it is simply astream of particles such as pellets from a shotgun. In terms of our modern concepts,we know that a moving gas has molecular motion that is a composite of randommotion of the molecules as well as a directed motion. Moreover, we know that thefreestream static pressure p ∞is simply a measure of the purely random motion of the molecules. Therefore, when the purely directed motion of the particles in Newton’s model results in the normal force per unit area, N/Ain Equation (14.2),CHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 879 Figure 14.9 Deﬁnition of angles for newtonian theory. this normal force per unit area must be construed as the pressure difference above p∞, namely, p−p∞on the surface. Hence, Equation (14.2) becomes p−p∞=ρ∞V2 ∞sin2θ (14.3) Equation (14.3) can be written in terms of the pressure coefﬁcient Cp=(p−p∞)/ 1 2ρ∞V2 ∞, as follows p−p∞ 1 2ρ∞V2 ∞=2 sin2θ or Cp=2 sin2θ (14.4) Equation (14.4) is Newton’s sine-squared law; it states that the pressure coefﬁcient is proportional to the sine square of the angle between a tangent to the surfaceand the direction of the freestream. This angle θis illustrated in Figure 14.9. Frequently, the results of newtonian theory are expressed in terms of the anglebetween a normal to the surface and the freestream direction, denoted by φas shown in Figure 14.9. In terms of φ, Equation (14.4) becomes C p=2 cos2φ (14.5) which is an equally valid expression of newtonian theory. Consider the blunt body sketched in Figure 14.9. Clearly, the maximum pressure, hence the maximum value of Cp, occurs at the stagnation point, where θ=π/2 and φ=0. Equation (14.4) predicts Cp=2 at the stagnation point. Contrast this hypersonic result with the result obtained for incompressible ﬂowtheory in Chapter 3, where C p=1 at a stagnation point. Indeed, the stagnation pressure coefﬁcient increases continuously from 1.0 at M∞=0 to 1.28 at M∞= 1.0 to 1.86 for γ=1.4 as M∞→∞ . (Prove this to yourself.) The result that the maximum pressure coefﬁcient approaches 2 at M∞→∞ can be obtained independently from the one-dimensional momentum equation,namely, Equation (8.6). Consider a normal shock wave at hypersonic speeds, as880 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 14.10 Hypersonic ﬂow across a normal shock wave. sketched in Figure 14.10. For this ﬂow, Equation (8.6) gives p∞+ρ∞V2 ∞=p2+ρ2V2 2 (14.6) Recall that across a normal shock wave the ﬂow velocity decreases, V2<V∞; indeed, the ﬂow behind the normal shock is subsonic. This change becomes more severe as M∞increases. Hence, at hypersonic speeds, we can assume that (ρ∞V2 ∞)/greatermuch(ρ2V2 2), and we can neglect the latter term in Equation (14.6). As a result, Equation (14.6) becomes, at hypersonic speeds in the limiting case as M∞→∞ , p2−p∞=ρ∞V2 ∞ or Cp=p2−p∞ 1 2ρ∞V2 ∞=2 thus conﬁrming the newtonian results from Equation (14.4). As stated above, the result that Cp=2 at a stagnation point is a limiting value as M∞→∞ . For large but ﬁnite Mach numbers, the value of Cpat a stagnation point is less than 2. Return again to the blunt body shown in Figure 14.9.Considering the distribution of C pas a function of distance salong the surface, the largest value of Cpwill occur at the stagnation point. Denote the stagnation point value of CpbyCp,max, as shown in Figure 14.9. Cp,maxfor a given M∞can be readily calculated from normal shock-wave theory. [If γ=1.4, then Cp,max can be obtained from p0,2/p1=p0,2/p∞, tabulated in Appendix B. Recall from Equation (11.22) that Cp,max=(2/γ M2 ∞)(p0,2/p∞−1).] Downstream of the stagnation point, Cpcan be assumed to follow the sine-squared variation predicted by newtonian theory; that is, Cp=Cp,maxsin2θ (14.7) Equation (14.7) is called the modiﬁed newtonian law. For the calculation of the Cpdistribution around blunt bodies, Equation (14.7) is more accurate than Equa- tion (14.4).CHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 881 Figure 14.11 Surface pressure distribution, paraboloid, M∞=4. Comparison of modiﬁed newtonian theory and time-dependent ﬁnite-difference calculations. Return to Figure 13.14, which gives the numerical results for the pressure distributions around a blunt, parabolic cylinder at M∞=4 and 8. The open symbols in this ﬁgure represent the results of modiﬁed newtonian theory, namely, Equation (14.7). For this two-dimensional body, modiﬁed newtonian theory isreasonably accurate only in the nose region, although the comparison improvesat the higher Mach numbers. It is generally true that newtonian theory is moreaccurate at larger values of both M ∞andθ. The case for an axisymmetric body, a paraboloid at M∞=4, is given in Figure 14.11. Here, although M∞is relatively low, the agreement between the time-dependent numerical solution (see Chap-ter 13) and newtonian theory is much better. It is generally true that newtoniantheory works better for three-dimensional bodies. In general, the modiﬁed newto-nian law, Equation (14.7), is sufﬁciently accurate that it is used very frequently inthe preliminary design of hypersonic vehicles. Indeed, extensive computer codeshave been developed to apply Equation (14.7) to three-dimensional hypersonicbodies of general shape. Therefore, we can be thankful to Isaac Newton for sup-plying us with a law which holds reasonably well at hypersonic speeds, althoughsuch an application most likely never crossed his mind. Nevertheless, it is ﬁttingthat three centuries later, Newton’s ﬂuid mechanics has ﬁnally found a reasonableapplication. 14.4 THE LIFT AND DRAG OF WINGS AT HYPERSONIC SPEEDS: NEWTONIAN RESULTS FOR A FLAT PLATE AT ANGLE OF ATTACK Question: Atsubsonic speeds, how do the lift coefﬁcient CLand drag coefﬁcient CDfor a wing vary with angle of attack α? Answer: As shown in Chapter 5, we know that: 1.The lift coefﬁcient varies linearly with angle of attack, at least up to the stall; see, for example, Figure 5.24.882 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 2.The drag coefﬁcient is given by the drag polar, as expressed in Equation (5.63), repeated below: CD=cd+C2 L πeAR(5.63) Since CLis proportional to α, then CDvaries as the square ofα. Question: Atsupersonic speeds, how do CLandCDfor a wing vary with α? Answer: In Chapter 12, we demonstrated for an airfoil at supersonic speeds that: 1.Lift coefﬁcient varies linearly withα, as seen from Equation (12.23), repeated below: cl=4α/radicalbig M2 ∞−1(12.23) 2.Drag coefﬁcient varies as the square ofα, as seen from Equation (12.24) for the ﬂat plate, repeated below: cd=4α2 /radicalbig M2 ∞−1(12.24) The characteristics of a ﬁnite wing at supersonic speeds follow essentially thesame functional variation with the angle of attack, namely, C Lis proportional to αandCDis proportional to α2. Question: Athypersonic speeds, how do CLandCDfor a wing vary with α? We have shown that CLis proportional to αfor both subsonic and supersonic speeds—does the same proportionality hold for hypersonic speeds? We haveshown that C Dis proportional to α2for both subsonic and supersonic speeds— does the same proportionality hold for hypersonic speeds? The purpose of thepresent section is to address these questions. In an approximate fashion, the lift and drag characteristics of a wing in hy- personic ﬂow can be modeled by a ﬂat plate at an angle of attack, as sketched inFigure 14.12. The exact ﬂow ﬁeld over the ﬂat plate involves a series of expansion Figure 14.12 Wave system on a ﬂat plate in hypersonic ﬂow.CHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 883 Figure 14.13 Flat plate at angle of attack. Illustration of aerodynamic forces. and shock waves as shown in Figure 14.12; the exact lift- and wave-drag coef- ﬁcients can be obtained from the shock-expansion method as described in Sec-tion 9.7. However, for hypersonic speeds, the lift- and wave-drag coefﬁcientscan be further approximated by the use of newtonian theory, as described in thisequation. Consider Figure 14.13. Here, a two-dimensional ﬂat plate with chord length c is at an angle of attack αto the freestream. Since we are not including friction, and because surface pressure always acts normal to the surface, the resultantaerodynamic force is perpendicular to the plate; that is, in this case, the normalforce Nis the resultant aerodynamic force. (For an inﬁnitely thin ﬂat plate, this is a general result that is not limited to newtonian theory, or even to hypersonicﬂow.) In turn, Nis resolved into lift and drag, denoted by LandD, respectively, as shown in Figure 14.13. According to newtonian theory, the pressure coefﬁcienton the lower surface is C p,l=2 sin2α (14.8) The upper surface of the ﬂat plate shown in Figure 14.13, in the spirit of newtoniantheory, receives no direct “impact” of the freestream particles; the upper surfaceis said to be in the “shadow” of the ﬂow. Hence, consistent with the basic modelof newtonian ﬂow, only freestream pressure acts on the upper surface, and wehave C p,u=0 (14.9) Returning to the discussion of aerodynamic force coefﬁcients in Section 1.5, we note that the normal force coefﬁcient is given by Equation (1.15). Neglectingfriction, this becomes c n=1 c/integraldisplayc 0(Cp,l−Cp,u)dx (14.10)884 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow where xis the distance along the chord from the leading edge. (Please note: In this section, we treat a ﬂat plate as an airfoil section; hence, we will use lowercase letters to denote the force coefﬁcients, as ﬁrst described in Chapter 1.) SubstitutingEquations (14.8) and (14.9) into (14.10), we obtain c n=1 c(2 sin2α)c or =2 sin2α (14.11) From the geometry of Figure 14.13, we see that the lift and drag coefﬁcients,deﬁned as c l=L/q∞Sandcd=D/q∞S, respectively, where S=(c)(l), are given by cl=cncosα (14.12) and cd=cnsinα (14.13) Substituting Equation (14.11) into Equations (14.12) and (14.13), we obtain cl=2 sin2αcosα (14.14) cd=2 sin3α (14.15) Finally, from the geometry of Figure 14.13, the lift-to-drag ratio is given by L D=cotα (14.16) [Note: Equation (14.16) is a general result for inviscid supersonic or hypersonic ﬂow over a ﬂat plate. For such ﬂows, the resultant aerodynamic force is the nor-mal force N. From the geometry shown in Figure 14.13, the resultant aerodynamic force makes the angle αwith respect to lift, and clearly, from the right triangle between L,D, and N, we have L/D=cotα. Hence, Equation (14.16) is not limited to newtonian theory.] The aerodynamic characteristics of a ﬂat plate based on newtonian theory are shown in Figure 14.14. Although an inﬁnitely thin ﬂat plate, by itself, is nota practical aerodynamic conﬁguration, its aerodynamic behavior at hypersonicspeeds is consistent with some of the basic characteristics of other hypersonicshapes. For example, consider the variation of c lshown in Figure 14.14. First, note that, at a small angle of attack, say, in the range of αfrom 0 to 15◦,clvaries in anonlinear fashion; that is, the slope of the lift curve is notconstant. This is in direct contrast to the subsonic case we studied in Chapters 4 and 5, where thelift coefﬁcient for an airfoil or a ﬁnite wing was shown to vary linearly with αat small angles of attack, up to the stalling angle. This is also in contrast with theresults from linearized supersonic theory as itemized in Section 12.3, leading toEquation (12.23) where a linear variation of c lwithαfor a ﬂat plate is indicated. However, the nonlinear lift curve shown in Figure 14.14 is totally consistent with the results discussed in Section 11.3, where hypersonic ﬂow was shown to begoverned by the nonlinear velocity potential equation, notby the linear equation expressed by Equation (11.18). In that section, we noted that both transonic andCHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 885 Figure 14.14 Aerodynamic properties of a ﬂat plate based on newtonian theory. hypersonic ﬂow cannot be described by a linear theory—both these ﬂows are inherently nonlinear regimes, even for low angles of attack. Once again, the ﬂat-plate lift curve shown in Figure 14.14 certainly demonstrates the nonlinearity ofhypersonic ﬂow. Also, note from the lift curve in Figure 14.14 that c lﬁrst increases as αin- creases, reaches a maximum value at an angle of attack of about 55◦(54.7◦to be exact), and then decreases, reaching zero at α=90◦. However, the attainment ofcl,max(point A) in Figure 14.14 is notdue to any viscous, separated ﬂow phe- nomenon analogous to that which occurs in subsonic ﬂow. Rather, in Figure 14.14,the attainment of a maximum c lis purely a geometric effect. To understand this better, return to Figure 14.13. Note that, as αincreases, Cpcontinues to increase via the newtonian expression Cp=2 sin2α That is, Cpreaches a maximum value at α=90◦. In turn, the normal force N shown in Figure 14.13 continues to increase as αincreases, also reaching a max- imum value at α=90◦. However, recall from Equation (14.12) that the vertical886 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow component of the aerodynamic force, namely, the lift, is given by L=Ncosα (14.17) Hence, as αincreases to 90◦, although Ncontinues to increase monotonically, the value of Lreaches a maximum value around α=55◦, and then begins to decrease at higher αdue to the effect of the cosine variation shown in Equation (14.17)— strictly a geometric effect. In other words, in Figure 14.13, although Nis increas- ing with α, it eventually becomes inclined enough relative to the vertical that its vertical component (lift) begins to decrease gradually. It is interesting to note that a large number of practical hypersonic conﬁgurations achieve a maximum CLat an angle of attack in the neighborhood of that shown in Figure 14.14, namely,around 55 ◦. The maximum lift coefﬁcient for a hypersonic ﬂat plate, and the angle at which it occurs, is easily quantiﬁed using newtonian theory. Differentiating Equa-tion (14.14) with respect to α, and setting the derivative equal to zero (for the condition of maximum c l), we have dcl dα=(2 sin22)(− sinα)+4 cos2αsinα=0 or sin2α=2 cos2α=2(1−sin2α) or sin2α=2 3 Hence, α=54.7◦ This is the angle of attack at which clis a maximum. The maximum value of cl is obtained by substituting the above result for αinto Equation (14.14): cl,max=2 sin2(54.7◦)cos(54.7◦)=0.77 Note, although clincreases over a wide latitude in the angle of attack (c lincreases in the range from α=0 toα=54.7◦), its rate of increase is small (that is, the effective lift slope is small). In turn, the resulting value for the maximum liftcoefﬁcient is relatively small—at least in comparison to the much higher c l,max values associated with low-speed ﬂows (see Figures 4.25 and 4.28). Returning toFigure 14.14, we now note the precise values associated with the peak of the lift curve (point A), namely, the peak value of c lis 0.77, and it occurs at an angle of attack of 54.7◦. Examining the variation of drag coefﬁcient cdin Figure 14.14, we note that it monotonically increases from zero at α=0 to a maximum of 2 at α=90◦. The newtonian result for drag is essentially wave drag at hypersonic speeds because we are dealing with an inviscid ﬂow, hence no friction drag. The variation of cd withαfor the low angle of attack in Figure 14.14 is essentially a cubic variation, in contrast to the result from linearized supersonic ﬂow, namely, Equation (12.24),which shows that c dvaries as the square angle of attack. The hypersonic re- sult that cdvaries as α3is easily obtained from Equation (14.15), which forCHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 887 smallαbecomes cd=2α3(14.18) The variation of the lift-to-drag ratio as predicted by newtonian theory is also shown in Figure 14.14. The solid curve is the pure newtonian result; it shows that L/Dis inﬁnitely large at α=0 and monotonically decreases to zero at α=90◦. The inﬁnite value of L/Datα=0 is purely ﬁctional—it is due to the neglect of skin friction. When skin friction is added to the picture, denoted by the dashed curve in Figure 14.14, L/Dreaches a maximum value at a small angle of attack (point Bin Figure 14.14) and is equal to zero at α=0. (At α=0, no lift is produced, but there is a ﬁnite drag due to friction; hence, L/D=0 atα=0.) Let us examine the conditions associated with (L/D)maxmore closely. The value of (L/D)maxand the angle of attack at which it occurs (i.e., the coordinates of point Bin Figure 14.14) are strictly a function of the zero-lift drag coefﬁcient, denoted by cd,0. The zero-lift drag coefﬁcient is simply due to the integrated effect of skin friction over the plate surface at zero angle of attack. At smallangles of attack, the skin friction exerted on the plate should be essentially thatat zero angle of attack; hence, we can write the total drag coefﬁcient [referring toEquation (14.15)] as c d=2 sin3α+cd,0 (14.19) Furthermore, when αis small, we can write Equations (14.14) and (14.19) as cl=2α2(14.20) and cd=2α3+cd,0 (14.21) Dividing Equation (14.20) by (14.21), we have cl cd=2α2 2α3+cd,0(14.22) The conditions associated with maximum lift-to-drag ratio can be found by dif-ferentiating Equation (14.22) and setting the result equal to zero: d(c l/cd) dα=(2α3+cd,0)4α−2α2(6α2) (2α3+cd,0)=0 or 8α4+4αcd,0−12α4=0 4α3=4cd,0 Hence, α=(cd,0)1/3(14.23) Substituting Equation (14.23) into Equation (14.21), we obtain /parenleftbiggcl cd/parenrightbigg max=2(c d,0)2/3 2cd,0+cd,0=2/3 (cd,0)1/3888 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow or/parenleftbiggL D/parenrightbigg max=/parenleftbiggcl cd/parenrightbigg max=0.67/(c d,0)1/3(14.24) Equations (14.23) and (14.24) are important results. They clearly state that the coordinates of the maximum L/Dpoint in Figure 14.14, when friction is included (point Bin Figure 14.14), are strictly a function of cd,0. In particular, note the expected trend that (L/D)maxdecreases as cd,0increases—the higher the friction drag, the lower is L/D. Also, the angle of attack at which maximum L/Doccurs increases as cd,0increases. There is yet another interesting aerodynamic condition that holds at (L/D)max, derived as follows. Substituting Equation (14.23) into (14.21), we have cd=2cd,0+cd,0=3cd,0 (14.25) Since the total drag coefﬁcient is the sum of the wave-drag coefﬁcient cd,wand the friction-drag coefﬁcient cd,0we can write cd=cd,w+cd,0 (14.26) However, at the point of maximum L/D(point Bin Figure 14.14), we know from Equation (14.25) that cd=3cd,0. Substituting this result into Equation (14.26), we obtain 3cd,0=cd,w+cd,0 or cd,w=2cd,0 (14.27) This clearly shows that, for the hypersonic ﬂat plate using newtonian theory, at theﬂight condition associated with maximum lift-to-drag ratio, wave drag is twicethe friction drag. This brings to an end our short discussion of the lift and drag of wings at hypersonic speeds as modeled by the newtonian ﬂat-plate problem. The quan-titative and qualitative results presented here are reasonable representations ofthe hypersonic aerodynamic characteristics of a number of practical hypersonicvehicles; the ﬂat-plate problem is simply a straightforward way of demonstratingthese characteristics. 14.4.1 Accuracy Considerations How accurate is newtonian theory in the prediction of pressure distributions overhypersonic bodies? The comparison shown in Figure 14.11 indicates that Equa-tion (14.7) leads to a reasonably accurate pressure distribution over the surfaceof ablunt body. Indeed, for “back-of-the-envelope” estimates of the pressure dis- tributions over blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds, modiﬁed newtonian is quitesatisfactory. However, what about relatively thin bodies at small angles of attack?We can provide an answer by using the newtonian ﬂat-plate relations derived inthe present section, and compare these results with exact shock-expansion theory(Section 9.7), for ﬂat plates at small angles of attack. This is the purpose of thefollowing worked example.CHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 889 EXAMPLE 14.1 Consider an inﬁnitely thin ﬂat plate at an angle of attack of 15◦in a Mach 8 ﬂow. Calculate the pressure coefﬁcients on the top and bottom surface, the lift and drag coefﬁcients, and the lift-to-drag ratio using ( a) exact shock-expansion theory, and (b ) newtonian theory. Compare the results. ■Solution (a) Using the diagram in Figure 9.35 showing a ﬂat plate at angle of attack, and following the shock-expansion technique given in Example 9.11, we have for the upper surface, for M1=8 andν1=95.62◦, ν2=ν1+θ=95.62+15=110.62◦ From Appendix C, interpolating between entries, M2=14.32 From Appendix A, for M1=8,p01/p1=0.9763 ×104, and for M2=14.32, p02/p2= 0.4808 ×106. Since p01=p02, p2 p1=p01 p1/slashbiggp02 p2=0.9763 ×104 0.4808 ×106=0.0203 The pressure coefﬁcient is given by Equation (11.22), and the freestream static pressurein Figure 9.28 is denoted by p Hence Cp2=2 γM2 1/parenleftbiggp2 p1−1/parenrightbigg =2 (1.4)(8)2(0.0203 −1)=−0.0219 To obtain the pressure coefﬁcient on the bottom surface from the oblique shock theory, we have from the θ-β-MforM1=8 andθ=15◦,β=21◦: Mn,1=M1sinβ=8 sin 21◦=2.87 Interpolating from Appendix B, for Mn,1=2.87, p3/p1=9.443. Hence the pressure coefﬁcient on the bottom surface is Cp3=2 γM2 1/parenleftbiggp3 p2−1/parenrightbigg =2 (1.4)(8)2(9.443 −1)= 0.1885 The lift coefﬁcient can be obtained from the pressure coefﬁcients via Equations (1.15), (1.16), and (1.18). cn=1 c/integraldisplayc 0(Cp,/lscript−Cp,u)dx=Cp3−Cp2=0.1885 −(−0.0219) =0.2104 The axial force on the plate is zero, because the pressure acts only perpendicular to theplate. On a formal basis, dy/dx in Equation (1.16) is zero for a ﬂat plate. Hence, from Equation (1.18), c /lscript=cncosα=0.2104 cos 15◦= 0.2032890 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow From Equation (1.19), cd=cnsinα=0.2104 sin 15◦= 0.0545 Hence,L D=c/lscript cd=0.2032 0.0545= 3.73 (b) From newtonian theory, the pressure coefﬁcient is given by Equation (14.4), where θ≡α. This is the pressure coefﬁcient on the lower surface, hence Cp3=2 sin2α=2 sin215◦= 0.134 From Equation (14.9), we have for the upper surface Cp2= 0 Hence, c/lscript=(Cp3−Cp2)cosα=0.134 cos 15◦= 0.1294 and cd=(Cp3−Cp2)sinα=0.134 sin 15◦= 0.03468 andL D=c/lscript cd=0.1294 0.3468= 3.73 Discussion. From the above worked example, we see that newtonian theory underpredicts the pressure coefﬁcient on the bottom surface by 29 percent, and of course predicts a value of zero for the pressure coefﬁcient on the upper surface in comparison to −0.0219 from exact theory—an error of 100 percent. Also, newtonian theory underpredicts c/lscriptandcdby 36.6 percent. However, the value of L/Dfrom newtonian theory is exactly correct. This is no surprise, for two reasons. First, the newtonian values of c/lscriptandcdare both underpredicted by the same amount, hence their ratio is not affected. Second, the value of L/Dfor supersonic or hypersonic inviscid ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, no matter what theory is used to obtainthe pressures on the top and bottom surfaces, is simply a matter of geometry. Because the pressure acts normal to the surface, the resultant aerodynamic forceis perpendicular to the plate (i.e., the resultant force isthe normal force N). Examining Figure 1.16, we see that when this is the case, the vectors RandNare the same vectors, and L/Dis geometrically given by L D=cotα For the above worked example, where α=15◦, we have L D=cot 15◦=3.73CHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 891 which agrees with the above calculations where c/lscriptandcdwere ﬁrst obtained, and L/Dis found from the ratio, L/D=c/lscript/cd. So, Equation (14.16), derived in our discussion of newtonian theory applied to a ﬂat plate, is not unique to newtonian theory; it is a general result when the resultant aerodynamic force is perpendicularto the plate. We induce from Example 14.1 the general fact that the newtonian sine- squared law, Equation (14.4), does not accurately predict the hypersonic pressuredistribution on the surface of two-dimensional bodies with local tangent lines thatare at small or moderate angles to the ﬂow, such as the bi-convex airfoil shapeshown in Figure 12.3. On the other hand, it generally turns out that the newtonianprediction of the lift-to-drag ratio for slender shapes at small to moderate anglesof attack is reasonably accurate. These statements apply to a gas with the ratio ofspeciﬁc heats substantially greater than one, such as the case of air with γ=1.4 treated in Example 14.1. In the next section, we will see that newtonian theorybecomes more accurate as M ∞→∞ andγ→1. For more information on the accuracy of newtonian theory applied to two-dimensional slender shapes, seeReference 73 which is a study of this speciﬁc matter. Finally, we note that newtonian theory does a better job of predicting the pressure on axisymmetric slender bodies, such as the 15 ◦half-angle cone shown in Figure 14.15.

These are exact shock relations and hold for all Mach numbers greater than unity, supersonicor hypersonic (assuming a calorically perfect gas). However, some interestingapproximate and simpliﬁed forms of these shock relations are obtained in thelimit of a high Mach number. These limiting forms are called the hypersonicshock relations; they are obtained below. Consider the ﬂow through a straight oblique shock wave. (See, e.g., Fig- ure 9.2.) Upstream and downstream conditions are denoted by subscripts 1 and2, respectively. For a calorically perfect gas, the classical results for changesacross the shock are given in Chapter 9. To begin with, the exact oblique shockrelation for pressure ratio across the wave is given by Equation (9.16). Since M n,1=M1sinβ, this equation becomes Exact:p2 p1=1+2γ γ+1/parenleftbigM2 1sin2β−1/parenrightbig(14.28) where βis the wave angle. In the limit as M1goes to inﬁnity, the term M2 1sin2β/greatermuch 1, and hence Equation (14.28) becomes as M 1→∞ :p2 p1=2γ γ+1M2 1sin2β (14.29) In a similar vein, the density and temperature ratios are given by Equations (9.15) and (9.17), respectively. These can be written as follows: Exact:ρ2 ρ1=(γ+1)M2 1sin2β (γ−1)M2 1sin2β+2(14.30) as M 1→∞ : ρ2 ρ1=γ+1 γ−1(14.31) T2 T1=(p2/p1) (ρ2/ρ1)(from the equation of state: p=ρRT) as M 1→∞ : T2 T1=2γ(γ−1) (γ+1)2M2 1sin2β (14.32) The relationship among Mach number M1, shock angle β, and deﬂection angle θ is expressed by the so-called θ-β-Mrelation given by Equation (9.23), repeated below: Exact: tanθ=2 cotβ/bracketleftBigg M2 1sin2β−1 M2 1(γ+cos 2β) +2/bracketrightBigg (9.23)CHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 893 This relation is plotted in Figure 9.9, which is a standard plot of the wave angle versus the deﬂection angle, with the Mach number as a parameter. Returningto Figure 9.9, we note that, in the hypersonic limit, where θis small, βis also small. Hence, in this limit, we can insert the usual small-angle approximation intoEquation (9.23): sinβ≈β cos 2β ≈1 tanθ≈sinθ≈θ resulting in θ=2 β/bracketleftbiggM2 1β2−1 M2 1(γ+1)+2/bracketrightbigg (14.33) Applying the high Mach number limit to Equation (14.33), we have θ=2 β/bracketleftbiggM2 1β2 M2 1(γ+1)/bracketrightbigg (14.34) In Equation (14.34), M1cancels, and we ﬁnally obtain in both the small-angle and hypersonic limits, as M 1→∞ andθ,hence βis small: β θ=γ+1 2(14.35) Note that, for γ=1.4, β=1.2θ (14.36) It is interesting to observe that, in the hypersonic limit for a slender wedge, the wave angle is only 20 percent larger than the wedge angle—a graphic demon-stration of a thin shock layer in hypersonic ﬂow. In aerodynamics, pressure distributions are usually quoted in terms of the nondimensional pressure coefﬁcient C p, rather than the pressure itself. The pres- sure coefﬁcient is deﬁned as Cp=p2−p1 q1(14.37) where p1andq1are the upstream (freestream) static pressure and dynamic pres- sure, respectively. Recall from Section 11.3 that Equation (14.37) can also bewritten as Equation (11.22), repeated below: C p=2 γM2 1/parenleftbiggp2 p1−1/parenrightbigg (11.22) Combining Equations (11.22) and (14.28), we obtain an exact relation for Cp behind an oblique shock wave as follows: Exact: Cp=4 γ+1/parenleftbigg sin2β−1 M2 1/parenrightbigg (14.38)894 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow In the hypersonic limit, as M 1→∞ :Cp=/parenleftbigg4 γ+1/parenrightbigg sin2β (14.39) Pause for a moment, and review our results. We have obtained limiting forms of the oblique shock equations, valid for the case when the upstream Mach number becomes very large. These limiting forms, called the hypersonic shock-wave rela-tions, are given by Equations (14.29), (14.31), and (14.32), which yield the pres-sure ratio, density ratio, and temperature ratio across the shock when M 1→∞ . Furthermore, in the limit of both M1→∞ and small θ(such as the hypersonic ﬂow over a slender airfoil shape), the limiting relation for the wave angle as afunction of the deﬂection angle is given by Equation (14.35). Finally, the form ofthe pressure coefﬁcient behind an oblique shock is given in the limit of hypersonicMach numbers by Equation (14.39). Note that the limiting forms of the equationsare always simpler than their corresponding exact counterparts. In terms of actual quantitative results, it is always recommended that the exact oblique shock equations be used, even for hypersonic ﬂow. This is particularlyconvenient because the exact results are tabulated in Appendix B. The valueof the relations obtained in the hypersonic limit (as described above) is morefor theoretical analysis rather than for the calculation of actual numbers. Forexample, in this section, we use the hypersonic shock relations to shed additionalunderstanding of the signiﬁcance of newtonian theory. In the next section, wewill examine the same hypersonic shock relations to demonstrate the principle ofMach number independence. Newtonian theory was discussed at length in Sections 14.3 and 14.4. For our purposes here, temporarily discard any thoughts of newtonian theory, and simplyrecall the exact oblique shock relation for C pas given by Equation (14.38), repeated below (with freestream conditions now denoted by a subscript ∞rather than a subscript 1, as used earlier): Cp=4 γ+1/bracketleftbigg sin2β−1 M2 ∞/bracketrightbigg (14.38) Equation (14.39) gave the limiting value of CpasM∞→∞ , repeated below: as M ∞→∞ : Cp→4 γ+1sin2β (14.39) Now take the additional limit of γ→1.0. From Equation (14.39), in both limits asM∞→∞ andγ→1.0, we have Cp→2 sin2β (14.40) Equation (14.40) is a result from exact oblique shock theory; it has nothing to dowith newtonian theory (as yet). Keep in mind that βin Equation (14.40) is the wave angle, not the deﬂection angle. Let us go further. Consider the exact oblique shock relation for the density ratio,ρ/ρ ∞, given by Equation (14.30), repeated below (again with a subscript ∞CHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 895 replacing the subscript 1): ρ2 ρ∞=(γ+1)M2 ∞sin2β (γ−1)M2 ∞sin2β+2(14.41) Equation (14.31) was obtained as the limit where M∞→∞ , namely, as M ∞→∞ :ρ2 ρ∞→γ+1 γ−1(14.42) In the additional limit as γ→1, we ﬁnd asγ→1and M ∞→∞ :ρ2 ρ∞→∞ (14.43) that is, the density behind the shock is inﬁnitely large. In turn, mass ﬂow con- siderations then dictate that the shock wave is coincident with the body surface.This is further substantiated by Equation (14.35), which is good for M ∞→∞ and small deﬂection angles: β θ→γ+1 2(14.35) In the additional limit as γ→1, we have asγ→1and M ∞→∞ andθandβare small: β=θ that is, the shock wave lies on the body. In light of this result, Equation (14.40)is written as Cp=2 sin2θ (14.44) Examine Equation (14.44). It is a result from exact oblique shock theory, takenin the combined limit of M ∞→∞ andγ→1. However, it is also precisely the newtonian results given by Equation (14.4). Therefore, we make the follow-ing conclusion. The closer the actual hypersonic ﬂow problem is to the limits M ∞→∞ andγ→1, the closer it should be physically described by newto- nian ﬂow. In this regard, we gain a better appreciation of the true signiﬁcanceof newtonian theory. We can also state that the application of newtonian theoryto practical hypersonic ﬂow problems, where γis always greater than unity, is theoretically not proper, and the agreement that is frequently obtained with exper-imental data has to be viewed as somewhat fortuitous. Nevertheless, the simplicityof newtonian theory along with its (sometimes) reasonable results (no matter howfortuitous) has made it a widely used and popular engineering method for the es-timation of surface pressure distributions, hence lift- and wave-drag coefﬁcients,for hypersonic bodies.896 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow 14.6 MACH NUMBER INDEPENDENCE Examine again the hypersonic shock-wave relation for pressure ratio as given by Equation (14.29); note that, as the freestream Mach number approaches in-ﬁnity, the pressure ratio itself also becomes inﬁnitely large. On the other hand,thepressure coefﬁcient behind the shock, given in the hypersonic limit by Equa- tion (14.39), is a constant value at high values of the Mach number. This hints strongly of a situation where certain aspects of a hypersonic ﬂow do not dependon Mach number, as long as the Mach number is sufﬁciently high. This is a typeof “independence” from the Mach number, formally called the hypersonic Mach number independence principle. From the above argument, C pclearly demon- strates Mach number independence. In turn, recall that the lift- and wave-dragcoefﬁcients for a body shape are obtained by integrating the local C p, as shown by Equations (1.15), (1.16), (1.18), and (1.19). These equations demonstrate that,since C pis independent of the Mach number at high values of M∞, the lift and drag coefﬁcients are also Mach number independent. Keep in mind that these conclu-sions are theoretical, based on the limiting form of the hypersonic shock relations. Let us examine an example that clearly illustrates the Mach number inde- pendence principle. In Figure 14.15, the pressure coefﬁcients for a 15 ◦half-angle wedge and a 15◦half-angle cone are plotted versus freestream Mach number for γ=1.4. The exact wedge results are obtained from Equation (14.38), and the exact cone results are obtained from the solution of the classical Taylor-Maccollequation. (See Reference 21 for a detailed discussion of the solution of the su-personic ﬂow over a cone. There, you will ﬁnd that the governing continuity,momentum, and energy equations for a conical ﬂow cascade into a single differ-ential equation called the Taylor-Maccoll equation. In turn, this equation allowstheexact solution of this conical ﬂow ﬁeld.) Both sets of results are compared with newtonian theory, C p=2 sin2θ, shown as the dashed line in Figure 14.15. This comparison demonstrates two general aspects of newtonian results: 1.The accuracy of the newtonian results improves as M∞increases. This is to be expected from our discussion in Section 14.5. Note from Figure 14.15 that below M∞=5 the newtonian results are not even close, but the comparison becomes much closer as M∞increases above 5. 2.Newtonian theory is usually more accurate for three-dimensional bodies(e.g., the cone) than for two-dimensional bodies (e.g., the wedge). This isclearly evident in Figure 14.15 where the newtonian result is much closerto the cone results than to the wedge results. However, more to the point of Mach number independence, Figure 14.15 alsoshows the following trends. For both the wedge and the cone, the exact resultsshow that, at low supersonic Mach numbers, C pdecreases rapidly as M∞is increased. However, at hypersonic speeds, the rate of decrease diminishes con-siderably, and C pappears to reach a plateau as M∞becomes large; that is, Cp becomes relatively independent of M∞at high values of the Mach number. This is the essence of the Mach number independence principle; at high Mach numbers,CHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 897 565557 Figure 14.16 Drag coefﬁcient for a sphere and a cone cylinder from ballistic range measurements; an example of Mach number independence at hypersonic speeds. ( Data Source: Cox, R. N., and L. F. Crabtree: Elements of Hypersonic Aerodynamics, Academic Press, New York, 1965). certain aerodynamic quantities such as pressure coefﬁcient, lift- and wave-drag coefﬁcients, and ﬂow-ﬁeld structure (such as shock-wave shapes and Mach wavepatterns) become essentially independent of the Mach number. Indeed, newtoniantheory gives results that are totally independent of the Mach number, as clearlydemonstrated by Equation (14.4). Another example of Mach number independence is shown in Figure 14.16. Here, the measured drag coefﬁcients for spheres and for a large-angle cone cylin-der are plotted versus the Mach number, cutting across the subsonic, supersonic,and hypersonic regimes. Note the large drag rise in the subsonic regime associatedwith the drag-divergence phenomenon near Mach 1 and the decrease in C Din the supersonic regime beyond Mach 1. Both of these variations are expected andwell understood. For our purposes in the present section, note, in particular, thevariation of C Din the hypersonic regime; for both the sphere and cone cylinder, CDapproaches a plateau and becomes relatively independent of the Mach number asM∞becomes large. Note also that the sphere data appear to achieve “Mach number independence” at lower Mach numbers than the cone cylinder. Keep in mind from the above analysis that it is the nondimensional variables that become Mach number independent. Some of the dimensional variables, suchasp, are not Mach number independent; indeed, p→∞ andM ∞→∞ . Finally, the Mach number independence principle is well grounded mathe- matically. The governing inviscid ﬂow equations (the Euler equations) expressedin terms of suitable nondimensional quantities, along with the boundary conditions898 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow for the limiting hypersonic case, do not have the Mach number appearing in them—hence, by deﬁnition, the solution to these equations is independent of theMach number. See References 21 and 52 for more details. 14.7 HYPERSONICS AND COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS The design of hypersonic vehicles today is greatly dependent on the use of com-putational ﬂuid dynamics, much more so than the design of vehicles for any otherﬂight regime. The primary reason for this is the lack of experimental ground testfacilities that can simultaneously simulate the Mach numbers, Reynolds num-bers, and high-temperature levels associated with hypersonic ﬂight. For suchsimulation, CFD is the primary tool. Reﬂecting once again on the philosophyillustrated in Figure 2.46, in the realm of hypersonic ﬂow the three partners arenot quite equal. Pure experimental work in hypersonics usually involves tests ateither the desired Mach number, the desired Reynolds number, or the desiredtemperature level, but not all at the same time nor in the same test facilities. Asa result, experimental data for the design of hypersonic vehicles is a patchworkof different data taken in different facilities under different conditions. Moreover,the data are usually incomplete, especially for the high-temperature effects, whichare difﬁcult to simulate in a wind tunnel. The designer must then do his or her bestto piece together the information for the speciﬁed design conditions. The nextpartner shown in Figure 2.46, pure theory, is greatly hampered by the nonlinearnature of hypersonic ﬂow, hence making mathematical solutions intractable. Inaddition, the proper inclusion of high-temperature chemically reacting ﬂows inany pure theory is extremely difﬁcult. For these reasons, the third partner shownin Figure 2.46, computational ﬂuid dynamics, takes on a dominant role. The nu-merical calculation of both inviscid and viscous hypersonic ﬂows, including allthe high-temperature effects discussed in Section 14.2, has been a major thrustof CFD research and design application since the 1960s. Indeed, hypersonics haspaced the development of CFD since its beginning. As an example of CFD applied to a hypersonic ﬂight vehicle appropriate to this chapter, consider the space shuttle shown in Figure 14.17. A numerical solu-tion of the three-dimensional inviscid ﬂow ﬁeld around the shuttle was carried outby Maus et al. in Reference 74. They made two sets of calculations, one for a per-fect gas with γ=1.4, and one assuming chemically reacting air in local chemical equilibrium. The freestream Mach number was 23 in both cases. The CFD tech-nique used for these calculations involved a time-dependent solution of the ﬂow inthe blunt nose region, patterned after our discussion in Section 13.5, and startingbeyond the sonic line a downstream marching approach patterned after our discus-sion in Section 13.4. The calculated surface pressure distributions along the wind-ward centerline of the space shuttle for both the perfect gas case (the circles) andthe chemically reacting case (the triangles) are shown in Figure 14.18. The expan-sion around the nose, the pressure plateau over the relatively ﬂat bottom surface,CHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 899 Plan area = 560,000 in2 xc = x0 = 840.7 in L = 1293 in (measured from nose to body flap hinge line) 100y zxxc45/H11034 Figure 14.17 Space shuttle geometry. 0 0.2 0.4 x/L0.6 0.8 1.0100200300 p p/H11009 M• = 23, /H9251 = 30/H11034 Perfect gas, /H9253 = 1.4 Equilibrium air Figure 14.18 Pressure distribution along the windward centerline of the space shuttle; comparison between a calorically perfect gas and chemically reacting equilibrium air calculations.

Also note that there is little difference in the pressure distribu-tions between the two cases; this is an example of the more general result thatpressure is usually the ﬂow variable least affected by chemically reacting effects. It is interesting to note, however, that a ﬂight characteristic as mundane as the vehicle pitching moment coefﬁcient is affected by chemically reacting ﬂoweffects. Close examination of Figure 14.18 shows that, for the chemically reactingﬂow, the pressures are slightly higher on the forward part of the shuttle, and slightlylower on the rearward part. This results in a more positive pitching moment. Sincethe moment is the integral of the pressure through a moment arm, a slight changein pressure can substantially affect the moment. This is indeed the case here,as shown in Figure 14.19, which is a plot of the resulting calculated pitchingmoment as a function of angle of attack for the space shuttle. Clearly, the pitchingmoment is substantially greater for the chemically reacting case. The work byMaus et al. was the ﬁrst to point out this effect on pitching moment, and it serves toreinforce the importance of high-temperature ﬂows on hypersonic aerodynamics.It also serves to reinforce the importance of CFD in the analysis of hypersonicﬂows. The predicted pitching moment used for the space shuttle design camefrom “cold-ﬂow” wind tunnel tests which did not simulate the high-temperatureeffects, that is, the designers used data for a perfect gas with γ=1.4 obtained in the wind tunnel. This is represented by the lower curve in Figure 14.19. Theearly ﬂight experience with the shuttle indicated a much higher pitching momentat hypersonic speeds than predicted, which required that the body ﬂap deﬂectionfor trim to be more than twice that predicted—an alarming situation. The reasonCHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 901 for this is now known; the actual ﬂight environment encountered by the shuttle at high Mach numbers was that of a high-temperature chemically reacting ﬂow—the situation reﬂected in the upper curve in Figure 14.19. The difference in thepitching moment between the two curves in Figure 14.19 is enough to account forthe unexpected extra body ﬂap deﬂection required to trim the shuttle. Althoughthese CFD results were obtained well after the design of the shuttle, they serveto underscore the importance of CFD to present and future hypersonic vehicledesigns. 14.8 HYPERSONIC VISCOUS FLOW: AERODYNAMIC HEATING Aerodynamic heating can become so severe at hypersonic speeds that it is thedominant design consideration for hypersonic vehicles. Indeed, for the reasondiscussed at the end of Section 1.1 and sketched in Figures 1.8 and 1.9, the noseand wing leading edges of hypersonic vehicles must be blunt rather than sharp, or else the vehicle will be destroyed by aerodynamic heating. In the history ofﬂight, the most unfortunate example of such destruction occurred on February 1,2003, when the space shuttle Columbia disintegrated over Texas during entry into the earth’s atmosphere. Several of the thermal protection tiles near the leadingedge of the left wing had been damaged by debris during launch. This allowedhot gases to penetrate the surface and destroy the internal wing structure. The physical mechanisms that create atmospheric heating, both thermal con- duction and radiation, are brieﬂy discussed at the end of Section 14.2. In thepresent section we will present some engineering methods for predicting aerody-namic heating, and apply them to some hypersonic ﬂow examples. Aerodynamicheating is a major subject in its own right, and is well beyond the scope of thisbook. (See Reference 52 for an in-depth discussion of aerodynamic heating ap-plied to hypersonic ﬂows.) However, its importance to the design of hypersonicvehicles demands that we examine a few aspects in the present chapter. 14.8.1 Aerodynamic Heating and Hypersonic Flow—The Connection What is it about hypersonic ﬂight that makes aerodynamic heating so severe?We address this question by reaching ahead to Chapter 16 and Equation (16.55),which introduces a dimensionless heat transfer coefﬁcient called the Stantonnumber C H, deﬁned as CH≡˙qw ρeue(haw−hw)(14.45) In Equation (14.45), ˙qwis the heat transfer rate per unit area at a given point on the body surface. In the English engineering system the units of ˙qware ft-lb/(s ·ft2); in the international system the units are W/m2. Also in Equation (14.45), ρeis the local density at the edge of the boundary layer at the given point, ueis the local velocity at the edge of the boundary layer, hwis the enthalpy of the gas at the902 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow wall, and hawis the adiabatic wall enthalpy deﬁned as the enthalpy of the gas at the wall when the wall temperature is the adiabatic wall temperature—the wall temperature when the wall becomes so hot that no more energy is conducted intothe wall from the gas adjacent to the wall. Consider the hypersonic ﬂow over a ﬂat plate at zero angle of attack, where ρ e=ρ∞andue=V∞(ignoring any viscous interaction effect as described in Section 14.2). For high Mach number laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, Tawis about 12 percent less than the total temperature in the freestream. For our purposes here,we make the approximation that T aw≈To,and hence in Equation (14.45) haw≈ho (14.46) where hois the total enthalpy of the freestream. From Equation (7.54), we can write ho=h∞+V2 ∞ 2(14.47) At hypersonic speeds, V∞is very large. Also the ambient air far ahead of the vehicle is relatively cool; hence h∞=cpT∞is relatively small. Thus, at high speeds, from Equation (14.47), ho≈V2 ∞ 2(14.48) The surface temperature of the plate, although it may be hot by normal standards,still must be maintained at below the melting or decomposition temperature of thesurface, which is usually much smaller than the total temperature at high Machnumbers. Thus we can easily make the assumption that h o/greatermuchhw (14.49) It follows from Equations (14.46), (14.48), and (14.49) that haw−hw≈ho−hw≈ho≈V2 ∞ 2(14.50) Equation (14.45), written for a ﬂat plate, is CH=˙qw ρ∞V∞(haw−hw) Invoking the approximation given by Equation (14.50), we have CH≈˙qw ρ∞V∞(V2 ∞/2) or ˙qw≈1 2ρ∞V3 ∞CH (14.51) Equation (14.51) states that the aerodynamic heating rate varies as the cube of the velocity. This is in contrast to aerodynamic drag, which varies only as the squareof the velocity. For this reason, at very high velocities, aerodynamic heatingCHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 903 becomes a dominant aspect of hypersonic vehicle design. This is the connection between aerodynamic heating and hypersonic ﬂow. 14.8.2 Blunt Versus Slender Bodies in Hypersonic Flow We have made the claim that the nose and wing leading edges of hypersonicvehicles must be blunt rather than sharp in order to reduce the aerodynamicheating in those regions. In this section we will begin to demonstrate this factquantitatively. In Section 14.8.1 we focused on the local heat transfer rate per unit area at a point on the surface of the vehicle, ˙q w. Here we expand our view to the total heat transferred to the vehicle per unit time, dQ/dt, which is equal to the local heat transfer rate integrated over the whole surface area of the vehicle. Wecan deﬁne an integrated overall Stanton number CHby an equation similar to Equation (14.45), CH≡dQ/dt ρ∞V∞(ho−hw)S(14.52) where Sis a reference area (planform area of a wing, cross-sectional area of a spherical entry vehicle, or the like) in the same spirit as in the deﬁnition ofthe lift or drag coefﬁcients for a vehicle. Using the approximations made inSection 14.8.1, Equation (14.52) can be approximated by an expression similarto Equation (14.51); i.e., dQ dt=1 2ρ∞V3 ∞SCH (14.53) Again we borrow a result from Chapters 16 and 18, namely that there exists an analogy between skin friction and aerodynamic heating, called Reynolds’analogy, expressed for a laminar ﬂow by Equation (18.50), repeated below: C H Cf=1 2Pr−2/3(18.50) where Cfis the local skin friction coefﬁcient as ﬁrst deﬁned in Section 1.5, and Pr is the Prandtl number deﬁned in Section 15.6. For our analysis here, it is safeto assume that Pr =1. Also, Reynolds analogy expressed by Eq. (18.50) can be written in terms of the integrated heat transfer and skin friction coefﬁcients, CH andCf, respectively. Hence, we have CH Cf=1 2(14.54) Inserting Equation (14.54) into (14.53) gives dQ dt=1 4ρ∞V3 ∞SC f (14.55) Let us consider the case of a hypersonic vehicle entering the atmosphere at very high Mach number from a mission in space. The force that slows this vehicle904 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow during entry is aerodynamic drag. From Newton’s second law, we have F=D=− mdV∞ dt(14.56) where mis the mass of the vehicle and the minus sign is necessary because dV∞/dtis negative; i.e., the vehicle is decelerating. From Equation (14.56), dV∞ dt=−D m=−1 2mρ∞V2 ∞SC D (14.57) where CDis the drag coefﬁcient of the vehicle. Mathematically, we can write dQ/dt as(dQ/dV ∞)(dV ∞/dt), where dV∞/dtis given by Equation (14.57). dQ dt=dQ dV∞/parenleftbigg −1 2mρ∞V2 ∞SC D/parenrightbigg (14.58) Equating Equations (14.55) and (14.58), dQ dV∞/parenleftbigg −1 2mρ∞V2 ∞SC D/parenrightbigg =1 4ρ∞V3 ∞SC f or dQ dV∞=−1 2mV∞Cf CD or dQ=−1 2mCf CDdV2 ∞ 2(14.59) Integrate Equation (14.59) from the beginning of entry to the atmosphere, where Q=0 and V∞=VE, to the end of entry where Q=QtotalandV∞=0: /integraldisplayQtotal 0dQ=−1 2Cf CD/integraldisplay0 VEd/parenleftbigg mV2 ∞ 2/parenrightbigg or Qtotal=1 2Cf CD/parenleftbigg1 2mV2 E/parenrightbigg (14.60) Equation (14.60) gives the total heat input Qtotalto the vehicle. It reﬂects two vital conclusions: 1.The quantity1 2mV2 Eis the initial kinetic energy of the vehicle as it ﬁrst enters the atmosphere. Equation (14.60) says that the total heat input is directly proportional to this initial kinetic energy. 2.Total heat input is directly proportional to the ratio of skin friction drag tothe total drag, C f/CD. The second of these conclusions is of direct relevance to our discussion. Recall from Section 1.5 that the aerodynamic drag on a vehicle is the sum ofdrag due to the pressure distribution exerted over its surface, called pressure dragCHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 905 Dp, and the drag due to shear stress exerted over its surface, called skin friction drag Df. In terms of the pressure drag coefﬁcient CDpand the skin friction drag coefﬁcient Cfwe have: CD=CDp+Cf From Equation (14.60), to minimize the total aerodynamic heating, we need to minimize the ratio Cf CDp+Cf Now consider two extremes of aerodynamic conﬁgurations: a sharp-nosed slender body such as the cone shown in Figure 14.20a and the blunt body shown in Figure 14.20b .

For this reason, all successful entry vehicles in practice, from intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), to the Apollo lunar return capsule, to the space shuttle,have utilized rounded noses and rounded leading edges. Even vehicles designedfor sustained hypersonic atmospheric ﬂight such as the X-43 shown in Figures 14.1and 14.2 have rounded noses and leading edges, although the radii of curvatureis small because the minimization of drag, hence the maximization of lift-to-dragratio, also becomes important in the design of such vehicles. 14.8.3 Aerodynamic Heating to a Blunt Body The concept that a blunt body would reduce aerodynamic heating in comparisonto a slender body was ﬁrst advanced by H. Julian “Harvey” Allen in 1951, asdiscussed in Section 1.1. From that time on, the calculation of blunt body aero-dynamic heating has been of paramount importance in the design of hypersonicvehicles. In this section we examine the calculation of aerodynamic heating tothe stagnation point of a blunt body because the stagnation point is frequently(but not always) the point of maximum heat transfer rate to a hypersonic vehicle. The boundary layer in the region of a stagnation point is laminar, and lends itself to the exact solution discussed in Section 18.5. When you read Chapter 18 asyou progress through this book, you will have the opportunity to enjoy this ratherelegant solution. In the present section, however, we wish to highlight only oneresult from Section 18.5, namely that given by Equation (18.83), repeated below. ˙q w∝1√ R(18.83) where Ris the nose radius at the stagnation point. This states that stagnation point heating varies inversely with the square root of the nose radius; hence to reduce the heating, increase the nose radius. Here we have absolute mathematical proofthat a blunt body reduces aerodynamic heating. The laminar boundary layer solution for the stagnation point case is described in Section 18.5. This solution yields a detailed result for stagnation point aerody-namic heating, namely Equations (18.65) for a circular cylinder and (18.70) for asphere, that gives the aerodynamic heating as a function of the detailed ﬂow ﬁeldproperties at the stagnation point. A much simpler engineering formula for aero-dynamic heating is given by Tauber and Meneses (Reference 97) in a generalizedform of Equation (14.51) as ˙q wρN ∞VM ∞C (14.61) where, for the stagnation point, M=3,N=0.5,C=1.83×10−8R−1/2/parenleftbigg 1−hw ho/parenrightbiggCHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 907 when the units for ˙qw,V∞, andρ∞andRare respectively, W/cm2, m/s, kg/m3, and m. Thus, for the stagnation point, using Equation (14.61), we have ˙qw=ρ0.5 ∞V3 ∞(1.83×10−8R−0.5)/parenleftbigg 1−hw ho/parenrightbigg (14.62) In Equation (14.62) we see the now familiar result that aerodynamic heating varies with the cube of the velocity, and that the stagnation point heating variesinversely with the square root of the nose radius. Equation (14.62) also showsthat˙q wvaries with the square root of the density, which at ﬁrst glance appears not to be consistent with Equation (14.51), repeated below ˙qw=1 2ρ∞V3 ∞CH (14.51) This relation appears to show that ˙qwis proportional to density to the ﬁrst power. However, once again drawing on results from Chapter 18, and speciﬁcally fromEquation (18.54), we see that the Stanton number itself for laminar ﬂow is in-versely proportional to the square root of the Reynolds number. Since the Reynoldsnumber by deﬁnition is in turn proportional to ρ ∞, we can state that CH∝1√ Re∝1√ρ∞ and then from Equation (14.51), ˙qw∝√ρ∞ This is consistent with Equation (14.62). EXAMPLE 14.2 During the entry of the space shuttle into the earth’s atmosphere, maximum stagnation point heating occurs at the trajectory point corresponding to an altitude of 68.9 km, whereρ ∞=1.075 ×10−4kg/m3, and a ﬂight velocity of 6.61 km/s. At this point on its entry trajectory, the shuttle is at a 40.2 degree angle of attack, which presents an effective noseradius at the stagnation point of 1.29 m. If the wall temperature is T w=1110 K, calculate the stagnation point heating rate. ■Solution Equation (14.62), repeated here, is ˙qw=ρ0.5 ∞V3 ∞(1.83×10−8R−0.5)/parenleftbigg 1−hw ho/parenrightbigg To evaluate the ratio hw/ho, we have from Equation (14.48) ho≈V2 ∞ 2=(6610)2 2=2.185×107J/(kg·K) Forhw, when the wall temperature is 1110 K, we can reasonably assume a calorically per- fect gas.

Our calculated result from Equation (14.62) agrees very well with theexperimental data. In Example 14.2 we calculated the heat transfer rate to the stagnation point. This is the point on the body of maximum aerodynamic heating rate. Along the windward centerline (on the bottom surface), the heating rate rapidly de-creases with distance downstream from the stagnation point. Figure 14.21 givesexperimental data for the local aerodynamic heating rate as reported in Refer-ence 98. Note the qualitative similarity between the variation of ˙q wwith distance as shown in Figure 14.21 and the variation of pressure with distance as shown inFigure 14.18. Although the results shown in these two ﬁgures are for slightlydifferent angles of attack, this comparison illustrates a qualitative trend that isfrequently seen in hypersonic aerodynamics, namely that the distribution of theaerodynamic heating rate over a surface tends to qualitatively follow the distri-bution of pressure over the surface. 14.9 APPLIED HYPERSONIC AERODYNAMICS: HYPERSONIC WAVERIDERS The maximum lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) maxfor a ﬂight vehicle is a measure of its aerodynamic efﬁciency. Unfortunately, for supersonic and hypersonic ﬂightvehicles, as the freestream Mach number increases, (L/D) maxdecreases rather dramatically. This is just a fact of nature, brought about by the rapidly increasingshock-wave strength as Mach number increases, with consequent large increasesin wave drag. Return to the variation of L/D versus angle of attack for a ﬂat plate shown in Figure 14.14. The solid curve is from the newtonian analysis discussedin Section 14.4. This is an inviscid ﬂow result, and shows that L/Dtheoretically approaches inﬁnity as the angle of attack αapproaches zero. In reality, the vis- cous shear stress acting on the plate surface causes L/Dto peak at a low valueCHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 909 0 0.1 0.3 x/L0.6 0.5 0.2 0.41040 203050xLHeat transfer rate, W/cm2Altitude = 68.8 km V/H11009 = 6.61 km/s /H9267/H11009 = 1.075 /H11003 10/H110024 kg/m3 /H9251 = 40.2/H11034R N = 1.29 mM/H11009 Figure 14.21 Experimental data for the local aerodynamic heating rate along the windward centerline of the space shuttle.

This is illustrated by the dashed curve in Fig- ure 14.14, which shows the variation of L/D modiﬁed by skin friction as predicted by the reference temperature method discussed in Section 18.4. The skin-friction calculation is for laminar ﬂow at Mach 10 and a Reynolds number of 3 ×106. Note that (L/D) maxfor the ﬂat plate is about 6.5. By comparison, (L/D) maxfor a Boeing 747 at normal cruising conditions near Mach 1 is about 20. So the (L/D) max for a hypersonic ﬂat plate, as shown in Figure 14.14, is a low value, reﬂecting thecharacteristically low lift-to-drag ratios generated by hypersonic vehicles. Andthe inﬁnitely thin ﬂat plate is the most efﬁcient lifting surface aerodynamicallycompared to other hypersonic shapes with ﬁnite thickness. Conclusion: The L/D value of vehicles at hypersonic Mach numbers is low. This is particularly910 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Shock waveShock attached along the leading edgeV/H11009 (a) Waverider (b) Generic vehicleDetached shock Figure 14.22 Comparison of waverider and generic hypersonic conﬁgurations. bothersome for future hypersonic vehicles designed for sustained ﬂight in the atmosphere. Current design practice for such vehicles is illustrated by the X-43shown in Figures 14.1 and 14.2. There is a class of hypersonic vehicle shapes, however, that generates higher value of L/D than other shapes—waveriders. A waverider is a supersonic or hy- personic vehicle that has an attached shock wave all along its leading edge, assketched in Figure 14.22 a. Because of this, the vehicle appears to be riding on top of its shock wave, hence the term “waverider.” This is in contrast to a moreconventional hypersonic vehicle, where the shock wave is usually detached fromthe leading edge, as sketched in Figure 14.22b . The aerodynamic advantage of the waverider in Figure 14.22 ais that the high pressure behind the shock wave under the vehicle does not “leak” around the leading edge to the top surface; the ﬂowﬁeld over the bottom surface is contained, and the high pressure is preserved, andCHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 911 1b 1aM/H11009 1aa 1bb Angle of attack, /H9251Lgeneric vehicle L DLwaverider waverider/H9251 LD generic vehicle Figure 14.23 Comparison of lift and L/Dcurves between waverider and a generic hypersonic vehicle. therefore more lift is generated on the vehicle. In contrast, for the vehicle shown in Figure 14.22b , there is communication between the ﬂows over the bottom and top surfaces; the pressure tends to leak around the leading edge, and the generalintegrated pressure level on the bottom surface is reduced, resulting in less lift.Because of this, the generic vehicle in Figure 14.22b must ﬂy at a larger angle of attack αto produce the same lift as the waverider in Figure 14.22a. This is illustrated in Figure 14.23, where the lift curves ( Lversus α) are sketched for the two vehicles shown in Figure 14.22. Note that the lift curve for the waverider isconsiderably higher because of the pressure containment compared to that for thegeneric vehicle. At the same lift, points 1 aand 1b in Figure 14.23 represent the waverider and generic vehicles, respectively. Also shown in Figure 14.23 are typ-ical variations of L/Dversus α, which for slender hypersonic vehicles are not too different for the shapes in Figures 14.22a andb. (Although the lift of the waverider at a given angle of attack is increased by the pressure containment on the bottomsurface, so is the wave drag; hence, the L/Dratio at a given angle of attack for the waverider is better, but not greatly so, than that for the generic vehicle.) However,note that because the waverider generates the same lift at a smaller α(point 1 ain Figure 14.23) than does the generic vehicle, which must ﬂy at a large α(point 1b in Figure 14.23), the L/Dfor the waverider is considerably higher (point 1 aa) than that for the generic shape point (1bb). Therefore, for sustained hypersonic cruisingﬂight in the atmosphere the waverider conﬁguration has a deﬁnite advantage. Question: How do you design a vehicle shape such that the shock wave is attached all along its leading edge; that is, how do you design a waverider? One answer is as follows. Consider the simple ﬂow ﬁeld generated by a wedge in a supersonic or hypersonic freestream as discussed in Section 9.3. Imagine thatthe top surface of the wedge is parallel to the freestream, and hence the only wavein the ﬂow is the planar shock wave propagating below the wedge, as sketchedat the top of Figure 14.24. Now imagine two straight lines arbitrarily traced onthe surface of the shock wave, coming to a point at the front of the shock. Con-sider all of the streamlines of the ﬂow behind the shock that emanate from these912 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow ShockConstruction from known flow field Resulting wing and shockLeading edges defined arbitrarilyon shockWedge definingflow field Flow behind shockFreestream flow Plane shock Wing shape Figure 14.24 Nonweiler or “caret” wing. arbitrarily traced lines. Taken together, these streamlines form a stream surface that can be considered the surface of a vehicle with its leading edges deﬁned bythe two arbitrarily traced lines on the shock wave. Because the ﬂow ﬁeld behinda planar shock wave is uniform with parallel streamlines, these stream surfacesare ﬂat surfaces that trace out a vehicle shape with a caret cross section as shownin Figure 14.24, named after the caret symbol ∧. If you now mentally strip away the imaginary generating ﬂow ﬁeld shown at the top of Figure 14.24, you haveleft the caret-shaped vehicle shown at the bottom of Figure 14.24. Concentratingon the vehicle shape at the bottom of Figure 14.24, the planar surfaces on thebottom of the vehicle are stream surfaces that exist behind a planar oblique shockwave—stream surfaces that are generated by streamlines that begin on the shocksurface itself. Hence, the shock wave is, by deﬁnition, attached to the leadingedge of the vehicle; this planar attached shock is shown stretching between thetwo straight leading edges of the vehicle sketched at the bottom of Figure 14.24.By deﬁnition, therefore, this vehicle is a waverider. Caution: The waverider is in principle a point-designed vehicle. The generating oblique shock sketched at thetop of Figure 14.24 pertains to a given freestream Mach number M ∞and a givenCHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 913 ﬂow deﬂection angle of the imaginary wedge that generates the oblique shock. Nevertheless, if you construct the vehicle shape shown at the bottom of Fig-ure 14.24 and put it in a freestream at the given M ∞and at an angle of attack such that the ﬂow deﬂection angle of the vehicle bottom surface is the same asthat of the imaginary generating wedge, then nature will make certain that theshock wave is attached all along the vehicle’s leading edge; that is, the vehicle willbe a waverider. Note that in Figure 14.24 we have oriented the imaginary gener-ating wedge such that its top surface is parallel to the freestream; hence, there isno wave over the top surface of the wedge. Consequently, the top surfaces of theresulting caret waverider shown at the bottom of Figure 14.24 are aligned withthe freestream, and there is no wave above the waverider. In principle any shape can be used for the imaginary body producing the ﬂow ﬁeld from which a waverider shape is carved. The simplest case is to usea wedge for the imaginary body as just described. This has the advantage that awedge produces a simple known ﬂow ﬁeld that is easily calculated, as treated inChapter 9. You do not need a CFD solution for this ﬂow. The ﬂow over a coneat zero angle of attack in a supersonic or hypersonic ﬂow is similarly a knownﬂow ﬁeld that can be used to generate waverider shapes. Because this conicalﬂow ﬁeld is quasi-three-dimensional, it provides more ﬂexibility in the generationof waverider shapes. The idea is the same. Consider the supersonic or hypersonicconical ﬂow ﬁeld over a right-circular cone at zero angle of attack as sketched atthe top of Figure 14.25. The exact numerical solution of this ﬂow ﬁeld is discussedin Section 13.6. The ﬂow ﬁeld is obtained from a solution of the Taylor-MaccollEquation, Equation (13.78), and tabulated results given in References 95 and 96.In short, this is a known ﬂow ﬁeld. At the top of Figure 14.25, we see a conicalshock wave attached at the vertex of the right-circular cone. This cone is simplythe imaginary body generating the ﬂow ﬁeld. Consider the dashed curve drawn on the bottom surface of the conical shock wave as sketched at the top of Figure 14.25. All of the streamlines ﬂowing throughthis dashed curve constitute a stream surface. In turn this stream surface deﬁnesthe bottom surface of a waverider with a leading edge traced out by the dashedcurve, as sketched at the bottom of Figure 14.25. Any curve can be traced on theconical shock; hence, any stream surface of the conical ﬂow ﬁeld downstream ofthe shock can be used as the surface of a waverider. When this is done, the shockwave will be attached all along the leading edge of the waverider, as shown inFigure 14.25. Moreover, the attached shock wave on this resulting waverider will,of course, be a segment of the conical shock wave shown at the top of Figure 14.25. The waverider concept was ﬁrst introduced by Nonweiler (Reference 99) in 1959, who generated caret-shaped waveriders from the two-dimensional ﬂow ﬁeldbehind a planar oblique shock wave generated by a wedge, as described earlier.Nonweiler was interested in such waveriders as lifting atmospheric entry bodies.The ﬁrst extension of Nonweiler’s concept to the use of a conical ﬂow as gener-ating ﬂow ﬁeld by Jones (Reference 100) in 1963, and further extensions to otheraxisymmetric generating ﬂows are discussed by Jones et al. in Reference 101. Anexcellent and authoritative survey of waverider research up to 1979 is given by914 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Construction from known flow field Resulting wing and shockCone defining flow field ShockStream surface (shape used as wing lower surface)Leading edges defined arbitrarily on shockFreestream Wing shape Shock Figure 14.25 Cone ﬂow wing. Townend in (Reference 102). In the early 1980s Rasmussen and his colleagues at the University of Oklahoma (for example, see References 103–105) utilizedhypersonic small-disturbance theory to design waveriders from ﬂow ﬁelds overright-circular cones as well as elliptic cones. In a manner consistent with his useof analytical solutions of the waverider ﬂows, Rasmussen was also able to usethe classic calculus of variations to optimize the waverider shapes utilizing theinviscid properties of the ﬂow. 14.9.1 Viscous-Optimized Waveriders In the work just described, the waverider conﬁgurations were designed (and some-times optimized) on the basis of inviscid ﬂow ﬁelds, not including the effect ofskin-friction drag. In turn, the drag predicted by such inviscid analyses was sim-ply wave drag, and the resulting values of the inviscid L/Dlooked promising. However, waveriders tend to have large wetted surface areas, and the skin-frictiondrag, always added to the waverider aerodynamics after the fact, tended to greatlydecrease the predicted inviscid lift-to-drag ratio. This made the waverider a lessinteresting prospect and led to a temporary lack of interest, indeed outright skepti-cism by researchers and vehicle designers in the waverider as a viable hypersonicconﬁguration. Beginning in 1987, the author and his students at the Universityof Maryland took a different tack. New families of waveriders were generatedwherein the skin-friction drag was included within an optimization routine tocalculate waveriders with maximum L/D. In this fashion, the trade-offs betweenCHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 915 wave drag and friction drag were accounted for during the optimization process, and the resulting family of waveriders had a shape and wetted surface area so asto optimize L/D. This family of waveriders is called viscous-optimization hyper- sonic waveriders, and subsequent CFD calculations and wind-tunnel tests haveproven their viability, thus greatly enhancing modern interest in the waveriderconcept. The design process for viscous-optimized waveriders was ﬁrst published in References 106 and 107. This work, beginning in the late 1980s, led to a newclass of waveriders where the optimization process is trying to reduce the wettedsurface area, hence reducing skin-friction drag, while maximizing L/D. Because detailed viscous effects cannot be couched in simple analytical forms, the formaloptimization methods based on the calculus of variations cannot be used. Instead,a numerical optimization technique was used based on the simplex method ofNelder and Mead (Reference 108). By using a numerical optimization technique,other real conﬁguration aspects could be included in the analysis in addition toviscous effects, such as blunted leading edges and an expansion upper surface (incontrast to the standard assumption of a freestream upper surface, i.e., an uppersurface with all generators parallel to the freestream direction). The results of thestudy by Bowcutt et al. led to a new class of waveriders, namely, viscous-optimizedwaveriders. Moreover, these waveriders produced relatively high values of L/D, as will be discussed later. For the viscous-optimized waverider conﬁgurations, the following philoso- phy was followed: 1.The lower (compression) surface was generated by a stream surface behind a conical shock wave. The inviscid conical ﬂow ﬁeld was obtained from thenumerical solution of the Taylor-Maccoll equation, derived in Section 13.6. 2.The upper surface was treated as an expansion surface, generated in amanner similar to that for the inviscid ﬂow about a tapered, axisymmetriccylinder at zero angle of attack, and calculated by means of theaxisymmetric method of characteristics. 3.The viscous effects were calculated by means of an integral boundary-layeranalysis following surface streamlines, including transition from laminar toturbulent ﬂow. 4.Blunt leading edges were included to the extent of determining themaximum leading-edge radius required to yield acceptable leading-edgesurface temperatures, and then the leading-edge drag was estimated bymodiﬁed newtonian theory. 5.The ﬁnal waverider conﬁguration, optimized for maximum L/Dat a given Mach number and Reynolds number with body ﬁneness ratio as a constraint,was obtained from the numerical simplex method taking into account all ofthe effects itemized in steps 1–4 within the optimization process itself. The following discussion provides some insight into the optimization process. First, assume a given conical shock wave in a ﬂow at a given Mach number, say, a conical shock wave angle of θ s=11 deg. at Mach 6. As discussed previously,916 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow now trace a curve on the surface of the shock wave. The stream surface generated from this curve is a bottom surface of a waverider, and the curve itself formsthe leading edge of the waverider. An inﬁnite number of such curves can betraced on the conical shock wave, generating an inﬁnite number of waveridershapes using the conical shock with θ s=11 deg. at M∞=6. Indeed, some of these leading-edge curves are shown in Figure 14.26. The optimization procedureprogresses through a series of these leading-edge shapes, each one generating anew waverider with a certain lift-to-drag ratio, and ﬁnally settling on that particularleading-edge shape that yields the maximum value of L/D. This is the optimum waverider for the given generating conical shock wave angle of θ s=11 deg. This resulting (L/D) maxis then plotted as a point in Figure 14.27 for the conical shock wave angle θs=11 deg. Figure 14.27 also gives the corresponding value of lift coefﬁcient CLand volumetric efﬁciency η=V2/3/Sp, where Vis the vehicle volume and Spis the planform area. Now choose another conical shock angle for generating the ﬂow ﬁeld, say, θs=12 deg., and repeat the preceding procedure, ﬁnding that leading-edge shape that yields the waverider shape that produces thehighest L/D. This result is now plotted in Figure 14.27 for θ s=12 deg. Then another conical shock wave angle, say θs=13 deg., is chosen, and the process is repeated again, ﬁnding that particular waverider shape that produces the highest L/D. This point is now plotted in Figure 14.27 for θs=13 deg. And so forth. The front views of these optimized waverider shapes are shown in Figure 14.28,each one labeled according to its generating conical shock-wave angle. Thesesame optimized waveriders are shown in perspective in Figure 14.29. Returningto Figure 14.27, note that the curve of L/Dversus θ sitself has a maximum value x y Figure 14.26 Examples of initial and optimized waverider leading-edge shapes.CHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 917 10 11 12 13 14 15.09.02 7.08.09.0 .03.04.05.06 .10.11.12.13.14 Coefficient of liftV olumetric efficiency, /H9257 = V2/3/Sp Lift over drag Flight conditions M/H11009 = 6 h = 100,000 ft Rel = 122.4 /H11003 106 Tw = 1100 K r/l = 0.00005b/l = 0.06l = 60 m Shock semi-vertex angle, degreesL/D CL /H9257 Figure 14.27 Results for a series of optimized waveriders at Mach 6; l= length of waverider, b/l=body ﬁneness ratio, and r=leading edge radius. ofL/D, occurring in this case for θs=12 deg.

Noted on Figure 14.27 is the body ﬁneness ratio, b/l, where bis the wing span and lis the length of the waverider. Recall that ﬁneness ratio is taken as a constraint in the optimization process. Forthis case, b/l=0.06. Finally, a summary three-view of the best optimum (the optimum of the optimums) waverider, which here corresponds to θ s=12 deg., is given in Figure 14.30. Also, in Figures 14.28 to 14.30 the lines on the upper andlower surfaces of the waveriders are inviscid streamlines. Note in these ﬁguresthat the shape of the optimum waverider changes considerably with θ s. Moreover, examining (for example) Figure 14.30, note the rather complex curvature of theleading edge in both the planform and front views; the optimization program is918 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow /H9258s = 11/H11034/H9258s = 12/H11034 /H9258s = 13/H11034/H9258s = 14/H11034 Figure 14.28 Results for a series of optimized waveriders at Mach 6. shaping the waverider to adjust both wave drag and skin-friction drag so that the overall L/Dis a maximum. Indeed, it was observed that the best optimum shape at any given M∞results in the magnitudes of wave drag and skin-friction drag being approximately the same, never differing by more than a factor of 2. For conicalshock angles below the best optimum (for example, θ s=11◦in Figures 14.28 and 14.29), skin-friction drag is greater than wave drag; in contrast, for conicalshock angles above the optimum (for example θ s=13◦and 14◦in Figures 14.28 and 14.29), skin-friction drag is less than wave drag. [Note: In Section 14.4, using newtonian theory for a ﬂat plate at angle of attack, at the ﬂight conditionassociated with the maximum lift-to-drag ratio, wave drag is twice the frictiondrag, as proved by Equation (14.27).] /H9258s = 11/H11034 /H9258s = 12/H11034 /H9258s = 13/H11034/H9258s = 14/H11034 Figure 14.29 Perspective views of a series of optimized waveriders at Mach 6.CHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 919 Figure 14.30 Three-view and perspective of the best optimized waverider at Mach 6. The results in Figures 14.27 to 14.30 pertain to M∞=6. Using the same pro- cedure, the best optimum waverider shape at any supersonic or hypersonic Mach number can be obtained. For example, the shape of the best optimized waveriderforM ∞=25 is given in Figure 14.31. Comparing the optimum conﬁguration ofM∞=6 (Figure 14.30), note that the Mach 25 shape has more wing sweep. This pertains to a conical ﬂow ﬁeld with a smaller wave angle, both of which areintuitively expected at higher Mach number. However, the body slenderness ratioatM ∞=6 is constrained to be b/l=0.06 (analogous to a supersonic transport such as the Concorde), but that b/l=0.09 is the constraint chosen at M∞=25 (analogous to a hydrogen-fueled hypersonic airplane). The two different slender-ness ratios are chosen on the basis of reality for two different aircraft with twodifferent missions at either extreme of the hypersonic ﬂight spectrum. For supersonic and hypersonic vehicles, L/D markedly decreases as M ∞in- creases. Indeed, Kuchemann (Reference 66) gives the following general empiricalcorrelation for (L/D) maxbased on actual ﬂight-vehicle experience: (L/D) max=4(M∞+3) M∞ This variation is shown as the solid curve in Figure 14.32. This ﬁgure is importantto our present discussion; it brings home the importance of viscous optimizedwaveriders. The Kuchemann curve (the solid curve) in Figure 14.32 represents atype of “L/D barrier” for conventional vehicles, which is difﬁcult to break. The open circles in Figure 14.32, which form an almost shotgun scatter of points,are data for a variety of conventional vehicles representing various wind-tunneland ﬂight tests. (Precise identiﬁcation of the sources for these points is given in920 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 14.31 Three-view and perspective of the best optimized waverider at Mach 25. 2 10 15 20 25 30 5 046810(L/D)max12141618Corda (1/2-power law-flow waverider) Bowcutt (cone flow waverider)(L/D) max = 6 (M + 2)/M (L/D)max = 4 (M + 3)/M 0 Mach number Figure 14.32 Maximum lift-to-drag ratio comparison for various hypersonic conﬁgurations.CHAPTER 14 Elements of Hypersonic Flow 921 Reference 109). The solid symbols pertain to the various optimized hypersonic waveriders discussed here. The solid squares are results for the waveriders basedon conical generating ﬂows as described below. The solid circles are resultsfor another family of viscous optimized waveriders based on the shock waveand downstream streamsurfaces generated by a one-half power law ogive-shapedbody, obtained by Corda and Anderson (Reference 110). From Figure 14.32 wesee that the viscous optimized waveriders break the L/D barrier, that is, they give (L/D) maxvalues that lie above the Kuchemann curve. Indeed, the L/D variation of the viscous optimized waveriders is more closely given by (L/D) max=6(M∞+2) M∞ This variation is shown as the dotted curve in Figure 14.32. The importance of theviscous optimized waveriders is established by the results shown in Figure 14.32.These results have been conﬁrmed by various wind-tunnel tests. They are thereason for renewed interest in the waverider conﬁguration as a hypersonic vehicle,particularly for sustained cruising in the atmosphere. The physical aspects that deﬁne the hypersonic ﬂow regime were discussed in Section 14.2. The inﬂuence of viscous interaction effects, high-temperature ﬂows,and aerodynamic heating on waverider design is discussed at length in the secondedition of Reference 52 (see pages 361–374, 409–413, and 644–646 of the sec-ond edition of Reference 52). Also, hypersonic vehicle design is sensitive to thelocation of the transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow, and the design of hyper-sonic waveriders is no exception. Numerical experiments carried out at M ∞=10 wherein the transition location was varied over a wide latitude, ranging from all-laminar ﬂow on one hand, to almost all-turbulent ﬂow on the other hand, with vari-ous cases in between, are discussed in References 52, 107, and 109. Although thesephysical phenomena have an effect on the optimized shape of viscous optimizedhypersonic waveriders, the resulting values of (L/D) maxare not greatly changed. Even with these real physical phenomena included in the optimization pro- cess, the viscous optimized hypersonic waverider remains a viable conﬁgura-tion for future hypersonic vehicle design. Indeed, the Air Force–sponsored andBoeing-designed X-51, shown in Figure 14.33, is a viscous-optimized waverider.SCRAMjet-powered, and designed for ﬂight at Mach 5 to 6, the X-51 will providethe technology for future atmospheric cruise missiles. On May 1, 2013, the X-51achieved a ﬂight of over six minutes and reached speeds of over Mach 5 for 210seconds. At the time of writing, this is the longest duration SCRAMjet poweredhypersonic ﬂight. It is only the second SCRAMjet-powered hypersonic vehicleof any type to achieve sustained atmospheric ﬂight, the ﬁrst being the X-43 in2004 (Figures 14.1 and 14.2). 14.10 SUMMARY Only a few of the basic elements of hypersonic ﬂow are presented here, withspecial emphasis on newtonian ﬂow results. Useful information on hypersonicﬂows can be extracted from such results. We have derived the basic newtonian922 PART 3Inviscid, Compressible Flow Figure 14.33 X51 waverider (U.S. Air Force Photo). sine-squared law: Cp=2 sin2θ (14.4) and used this result to treat the case of a hypersonic ﬂat plate in Section 14.4. We also obtained the limiting form of the oblique shock relations as M∞→∞ , that is, the hypersonic shock relations. From these relations, we were able toexamine the signiﬁcance of newtonian theory more thoroughly, namely, Equa-tion (14.4) becomes an exact relation for a hypersonic ﬂow in the combined limitofM ∞→∞ andγ→1. Finally, these hypersonic shock relations illustrate the existence of the Mach number independence principle. 14.11 PROBLEMS 14.1 Repeat Problem 9.13 using a. Newtonian theory b.

We will treat both incompressible and compress-ible viscous ﬂows. 923CHAPTER15 Introduction to the Fundamental Principles andEquations of Viscous Flow I do not see then, I admit, how one can explain the resistance of ﬂuids by the theory in a satisfactory manner. It seems to me on the contrary that this theory,dealt with and studied with profound attention gives, at least in most cases,resistance absolutely zero: a singular paradox which I leave to geometriciansto explain. Jean LeRond d’Alembert, 1768 PREVIEW BOX The real life of aerodynamics—that is what the present and remaining chapters are all about. Except for thefew earlier sections on viscous ﬂow, most of our pre-vious discussions in this book have dealt with inviscidﬂows. Do not get the wrong impression; a large num-ber of practical aerodynamic applications are appro-priately treated by assuming inviscid ﬂow, as we havealready seen. Thank goodness for this, because invis-cid ﬂows are usually easier to analyze than viscousﬂows. But some aspects of aerodynamics are inher-ently viscous in nature, such as skin-friction drag,aerodynamic heating, and ﬂow separation. To dealwith these important aspects, we have to undertakethe study of viscous ﬂow, which is the subject of theremainder of this book. The present chapter is all about the fundamental aspects of viscous ﬂow. Here you will ﬁnd new def-initions, new concepts, and new equations, includingthe derivation of the Navier-Stokes equations, whichare nothing more than the continuity, momentum, andenergy equations for a viscous ﬂow. Although someof the basic concepts of viscous ﬂow were ﬁrst intro-duced in Chapter 1, the present chapter goes far be-yond that discussed in Chapter 1. As you read throughthis chapter, as well as the subsequent chapters, youwill ﬁnd a small amount of repetition of a few thoughts 925926 PART 4Viscous Flow introduced in earlier chapters. This is intentional. I want to make Part 4 of this book a stand-alone,almost self-contained presentation of viscous ﬂow.Besides, a little bit of repetition never hurt anybody,and in the educational process it can help a lot. Sojump into this chapter and immerse yourself in theideas and thoughts of viscous ﬂow. Come into the realworld. 15.1 INTRODUCTION In the above quotation, the “theory” referred to by d’Alembert is inviscid, in- compressible ﬂow theory; we have seen in Chapter 3 that such theory leads to aprediction of zero drag on a closed two-dimensional body—this is d’Alembert’sparadox. In reality, there is always a ﬁnite drag on any body immersed in a mov-ing ﬂuid. Our earlier predictions of zero drag are a result of the inadequacy ofthe theory rather than some ﬂuke of nature. With the exception of induced dragand supersonic wave drag, which can be obtained from inviscid theory, the cal-culation of all other forms of drag must explicitly take into account the presenceof viscosity, which has not been included in our previous inviscid analyses. Thepurpose of the remaining chapters in this book is to discuss the basic aspects ofviscous ﬂows, thus “rounding out” our overall presentation of the fundamentals ofaerodynamics. In so doing, we address the predictions of aerodynamic drag andaerodynamic heating. To help put our current discussion in perspective, return tothe block diagram of ﬂow categories given in Figure 1.45. All of our previousdiscussions have focused on blocks D,E, and F—inviscid, incompressible, and compressible ﬂows. Now, for the remaining six chapters, we move to the leftbranch in Figure 1.45, and deal with blocks C,E, and F—viscous, incompress- ible, and compressible ﬂows. Our treatment of viscous ﬂows will be intentionally brief—our purpose is to present enough of the fundamental concepts and equations to give you theﬂavor of viscous ﬂows. A thorough presentation of viscous ﬂow theory woulddouble the size of this book (at the very least) and is clearly beyond our scope. Astudy of viscous ﬂow is an essential part of any serious study of aerodynamics.Many books have been exclusively devoted to the presentation of viscous ﬂows;References 40 and 41 are two good examples. You are encouraged to examinethese references closely. There have been sections on viscous ﬂow topics earlier in this book, namely, Sections 1.11, 4.12, 9.10, 10.6, and 12.4. These are stand-alone sections dealingwith viscous ﬂow aspects pertinent to the chapters in which they appear. You, thereader, have had two choices: (1) to read these viscous ﬂow sections in order todiscover how friction has an impact on some of the ideal inviscid ﬂows discussedin the main body of the chapter, or (2) to by-pass these sections in order to preservethe intellectual continuity of a study of inviscid ﬂows that is, after all, the mainthrust of Parts 2 and 3 of this book. Now, we are at Part 4 dealing exclusively withviscous ﬂow. Readers who took the ﬁrst choice will ﬁnd some slight repetition inCHAPTER 15 Introduction to the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Viscous Flow 927 Figure 15.1 Road map for Chapter 15. Part 4, but repetition is a good thing in learning a new subject. Readers who took the second choice will ﬁnd Part 4 a totally self-contained discussion of viscousﬂow that does not depend on reading the earlier viscous ﬂow sections; however,at appropriate stages of our discussions you will ﬁnd direct references to speciﬁcearlier sections that ﬁt nicely into the continuity of Part 4. The road map for the present chapter is given in Figure 15.1. Our course is to ﬁrst examine some qualitative aspects of viscous ﬂows as shown on the leftbranch of Figure 15.1. Then we quantify some of these aspects as given on the rightbranch. In the process, we obtain the governing equations for a general viscousﬂow—in particular, the Navier-Stokes equations (the momentum equations) andthe viscous ﬂow energy equation. Finally, we examine a numerical solution tothese equations. 15.2 QUALITATIVE ASPECTS OF VISCOUS FLOW What is a viscous ﬂow? Answer: A ﬂow where the effects of viscosity, thermal conduction, and mass diffusion are important. The phenomenon of mass diffusionis important in a gas with gradients in its chemical species, for example, the ﬂowof air over a surface through which helium is being injected or the chemicallyreacting ﬂow through a jet engine or over a high-speed reentry body. In this book,928 PART 4Viscous Flow Insert (a) Insert (b)n V dspVn Separation pointSeparated regions/H9270 Reversed flow Figure 15.2 Effect of viscosity on a body in a moving ﬂuid: shear stress and separated ﬂow. we are not concerned with the effects of diffusion, and therefore we treat a viscous ﬂow as one where only viscosity and thermal conduction are important. First, consider the inﬂuence of viscosity. Imagine two solid surfaces slipping over each other, such as this book being pushed across a table. Clearly, there willbe a frictional force between these objects which will retard their relative motion.The same is true for the ﬂow of a ﬂuid over a solid surface; the inﬂuence of frictionbetween the surface and the ﬂuid adjacent to the surface acts to create a frictionalforce which retards the relative motion. This has an effect on both the surface andthe ﬂuid. The surface feels a “tugging” force in the direction of the ﬂow, tangentialto the surface. This tangential force per unit area is deﬁned as the shear stress τ, ﬁrst introduced in Section 1.5 and illustrated in Figure 15.2. As an equal andopposite reaction, the ﬂuid adjacent to the surface feels a retarding force whichdecreases its local ﬂow velocity, as shown in insert aof Figure 15.2. Indeed, the inﬂuence of friction is to create V=0 right at the body surface—this is called the no-slip condition which dominates viscous ﬂow. In any real continuum ﬂuid ﬂow over a solid surface, the ﬂow velocity is zero at the surface. Just above the surface,the ﬂow velocity is ﬁnite, but retarded, as shown in insert a. Ifnrepresents the coordinate normal to the surface, then in the region near the surface, V=V(n), where V=0 atn=0, and Vincreases as nincreases. The plot of Vversus n as shown in insert ais called a velocity proﬁle. Clearly, the region of ﬂow near the surface has velocity gradients, ∂V/∂n, which are due to the frictional force between the surface and the ﬂuid. In addition to the generation of shear stress, friction also plays another (but related) role in dictating the ﬂow over the body in Figure 15.2. Consider a ﬂuidelement moving in the viscous ﬂow near a surface, as sketched in Figure 15.3.Assume that the ﬂow is in its earliest moments of being started. At the station s 1,CHAPTER 15 Introduction to the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Viscous Flow 929 Fluid elementReversed flowAdversepressuregradientp p 1p2p3 s3 s2 s1 s1s2ss3V1V2 V3 Figure 15.3 Separated ﬂow induced by an adverse pressure gradient. This picture corresponds to the early evolution of the ﬂow; once the ﬂow separates from the surface between points 2 and 3, the ﬂuid element shown at s3is in reality different from that shown at s1ands2because the primary ﬂow moves away from the surface, as shown in Figure 15.2. the velocity of the ﬂuid element is V1. Assume that the ﬂow over the surface produces an increasing pressure distribution in the ﬂow direction (i.e., assume p3>p2>p1). Such a region of increasing pressure is called an adverse pressure gradient. Now follow the ﬂuid element as it moves downstream. The motion of the element is already retarded by the effect of friction; in addition, it must workits way along the ﬂow against an increasing pressure, which tends to furtherreduce its velocity. Consequently, at station 2 along the surface, its velocity V 2 is less than V1. As the ﬂuid element continues to move downstream, it may completely “run out of steam,” come to a stop, and then, under the action of theadverse pressure gradient, actually reverse its direction and start moving backupstream. This “reversed ﬂow” is illustrated at station s 3in Figure 15.3, where the ﬂuid element is now moving upstream at the velocity V3. The picture shown in Figure 15.3 is meant to show the ﬂow details very near the surface at the veryinitiation of the ﬂow. In the bigger picture of this ﬂow at later times shown inFigure 15.2, the consequence of such reversed-ﬂow phenomena is to cause theﬂow to separate from the surface and create a large wake of recirculating ﬂow downstream of the surface. The point of separation on the surface in Figure 15.2occurs where ∂V/∂n=0 at the surface, as sketched in insert bof Figure 15.2. Beyond this point, reversed ﬂow occurs. Therefore, in addition to the generationof shear stress, the inﬂuence of friction can cause the ﬂow over a body to separatefrom the surface. When such separated ﬂow occurs, the pressure distribution overthe surface is greatly altered. The primary ﬂow over the body in Figure 15.2 nolonger sees the complete body shape; rather, it sees the body shape upstream930 PART 4Viscous Flow Figure 15.4 Schematic of the pressure distributions for attached and separated ﬂow over the upper surface of the body illustrated inFigure 15.2. of the separation point, but downstream of the separation point it sees a greatly deformed “effective body” due to the large separated region. The net effect isto create a pressure distribution over the actual body surface which results in anintegrated force in the ﬂow direction, that is, a drag. To see this more clearly,consider the pressure distribution over the upper surface of the body as sketchedin Figure 15.4. If the ﬂow were attached, the pressure over the downstream portionof the body would be given by the dashed curve. However, for separated ﬂow, thepressure over the downstream portion of the body is smaller, given by the solidcurve in Figure 15.4. Now return to Figure 15.2. Note that the pressure over theupper rearward surface contributes a force in the negative drag direction; that is, pacting over the element of surface dsshown in Figure 15.2 has a horizontal component in the upstream direction. If the ﬂow were inviscid, subsonic, andattached and the body were two-dimensional, the forward-acting components ofthe pressure distribution shown in Figure 15.2 would exactly cancel the rearward-acting components due to the pressure distribution over other parts of the bodysuch that the net, integrated pressure distribution would give zero drag. Thiswould be d’Alembert’s paradox discussed in Chapter 3. However, for the viscous,separated ﬂow, we see that pis reduced in the separated region; hence, it can no longer fully cancel the pressure distribution over the remainder of the body. Thenet result is the production of drag; this is called the pressure drag due to ﬂow separation and is denoted by D p. In summary, we see that the effects of viscosity are to produce two types of drag as follows: Dfis the skin friction drag, that is, the component in the drag direction of the integral of the shear stress τover the body. Dpis the pressure drag due to separation, that is, the component in the drag direction of the integral of the pressure distribution over the body.CHAPTER 15 Introduction to the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Viscous Flow 931 Dpis sometimes called form drag. The sum Df+Dpis called the proﬁle drag of a two-dimensional body. For a three-dimensional body such as a complete airplane, the sum Df+Dpis frequently called parasite drag. (See Reference 2 for a more extensive discussion of the classiﬁcation of different drag contributions.) The occurrence of separated ﬂow over an aerodynamic body not only in- creases the drag but also results in a substantial loss of lift. Such separated ﬂow isthe cause of airfoil stall as discussed in Section 4.3. For these reasons, the study,understanding, and prediction of separated ﬂow is an important aspect of viscousﬂow. Let us turn our attention to the inﬂuence of thermal conduction—another overall physical characteristic of viscous ﬂow in addition to friction. Again, letus draw an analogy from two solid bodies slipping over each other, such as themotion of this book over the top of a table. If we would press hard on the book,and vigorously rub it back and forth over the table, the cover of the book as wellas the table top would soon become warm. Some of the energy we expend inpushing the book over the table will be dissipated by friction, and this shows upas a form of heating of the bodies. The same phenomenon occurs in the ﬂow of aﬂuid over a body. The moving ﬂuid has a certain amount of kinetic energy; in theprocess of ﬂowing over a surface, the ﬂow velocity is decreased by the inﬂuenceof friction, as discussed earlier, and hence the kinetic energy is decreased. Thislost kinetic energy reappears in the form of internal energy of the ﬂuid, hencecausing the temperature to rise. This phenomenon is called viscous dissipation within the ﬂuid. In turn, when the ﬂuid temperature increases, there is an overalltemperature difference between the warmer ﬂuid and the cooler body. We knowfrom experience that heat is transferred from a warmer body to a cooler body;therefore, heat will be transferred from the warmer ﬂuid to the cooler surface.This is the mechanism of aerodynamic heating of a body. Aerodynamic heating becomes more severe as the ﬂow velocity increases, because more kinetic energyis dissipated by friction, and hence the overall temperature difference betweenthe warm ﬂuid and the cool surface increases. As discussed in Chapter 14, athypersonic speeds, aerodynamic heating becomes a dominant aspect of the ﬂow. All the aspects discussed above—shear stress, ﬂow separation, aerodynamic heating, etc.—are dominated by a single major question in viscous ﬂow, namely,Is the ﬂow laminar or turbulent? Consider the viscous ﬂow over a surface assketched in Figure 15.5. If the path lines of various ﬂuid elements are smooth and (a) Laminar flow (b) Turbulent flow Figure 15.5 Path lines for laminar and turbulent ﬂows.932 PART 4Viscous Flow Laminar Turbulent Vn Figure 15.6 Schematic of velocity proﬁles for laminar and turbulent ﬂows. regular, as shown in Figure 15.5 a, the ﬂow is called laminar ﬂow. In contrast, if the motion of a ﬂuid element is very irregular and tortuous, as shown in Figure 15.5b , the ﬂow is called turbulent ﬂow. Because of the agitated motion in a turbulent ﬂow, the higher-energy ﬂuid elements from the outer regions of the ﬂow are pumped close to the surface. Hence, the average ﬂow velocity near a solid surfaceis larger for a turbulent ﬂow in comparison with laminar ﬂow. This comparisonis shown in Figure 15.6, which gives velocity proﬁles for laminar and turbulentﬂow. Note that immediately above the surface, the turbulent ﬂow velocities aremuch larger than the laminar values. If (∂V/∂n) n=0denotes the velocity gradient at the surface, we have /bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg∂V ∂n/parenrightbigg n=0/bracketrightbigg turbulent>/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg∂V ∂n/parenrightbigg n=0/bracketrightbigg laminar Because of this difference, the frictional effects are more severe for a turbulentﬂow; both the shear stress and aerodynamic heating are larger for the turbulent ﬂowin comparison with laminar ﬂow. However, turbulent ﬂow has a major redeemingvalue; because the energy of the ﬂuid elements close to the surface is larger in aturbulent ﬂow, a turbulent ﬂow does not separate from the surface as readily as alaminar ﬂow. If the ﬂow over a body is turbulent, it is less likely to separate fromthe body surface, and if ﬂow separation does occur, the separated region will besmaller. As a result, the pressure drag due to ﬂow separation D pwill be smaller for turbulent ﬂow. This discussion points out one of the great compromises in aerodynamics. For the ﬂow over a body, is laminar or turbulent ﬂow preferable? There is no patanswer; it depends on the shape of the body. In general, if the body is slender,as sketched in Figure 15.7 a, the friction drag D fis much greater than Dp. ForCHAPTER 15 Introduction to the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Viscous Flow 933 Figure 15.7 Drag on slender and blunt bodies. Transition pointTransition region LaminarTurbulent xcr Figure 15.8 Transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow. this case, because Dfis smaller for laminar than for turbulent ﬂow, laminar ﬂow is desirable for slender bodies. In contrast, if the body is blunt, as sketched in Figure 15.7b ,Dpis much greater than Df. For this case, because Dpis smaller for turbulent than for laminar ﬂow, turbulent ﬂow is desirable for blunt bodies.The above comments are not all-inclusive; they simply state general trends, andfor any given body, the aerodynamic virtues of laminar versus turbulent ﬂow mustalways be assessed. Although, from the above discussion, laminar ﬂow is preferable for some cases, and turbulent ﬂow for other cases, in reality we have little control overwhat actually happens. Nature makes the ultimate decision as to whether a ﬂowwill be laminar or turbulent. There is a general principle in nature that a system,when left to itself, will always move toward its state of maximum disorder. Tobring order to the system, we generally have to exert some work on the systemor expend energy in some manner. (This analogy can be carried over to dailylife; a room will soon become cluttered and disordered unless we exert someeffort to keep it clean.) Since turbulent ﬂow is much more “disordered” thanlaminar ﬂow, nature will always favor the occurrence of turbulent ﬂow. Indeed,in the vast majority of practical aerodynamic problems, turbulent ﬂow is usuallypresent. Let us examine this phenomenon in more detail. Consider the viscous ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, as sketched in Figure 15.8. The ﬂow immediately upstream of934 PART 4Viscous Flow the leading edge is uniform at the freestream velocity. However, downstream of the leading edge, the inﬂuence of friction will begin to retard the ﬂow adjacentto the surface, and the extent of this retarded ﬂow will grow higher above theplate as we move downstream, as shown in Figure 15.8. To begin with, the ﬂowjust downstream of the leading edge will be laminar. However, after a certaindistance, instabilities will appear in the laminar ﬂow; these instabilities rapidlygrow, causing transition to turbulent ﬂow. The transition from laminar to turbulentﬂow takes place over a ﬁnite region, as sketched in Figure 15.8. However, forpurposes of analysis, we frequently model the transition region as a single point,called the transition point, upstream of which the ﬂow is laminar and downstream of which the ﬂow is turbulent. The distance from the leading edge to the transitionpoint is denoted by x cr. The value of xcrdepends on a whole host of phenomena. For example, some characteristics which encourage transition from laminar toturbulent ﬂow, and hence reduce x cr, are: 1.Increased surface roughness. Indeed, to promote turbulent ﬂow over a body, rough grit can be placed on the surface near the leading edge to “trip” thelaminar ﬂow into turbulent ﬂow. This is a frequently used technique inwind-tunnel testing. Also, the dimples on the surface of a golf ball aredesigned to encourage turbulent ﬂow, thus reducing D p. In contrast, in situations where we desire large regions of laminar ﬂow, such as the ﬂowover the NACA six-series laminar-ﬂow airfoils, the surface should be assmooth as possible. The main reason why such airfoils do not produce inactual ﬂight the large regions of laminar ﬂow observed in the laboratory isthat manufacturing irregularities and bug spots (believe it or not) roughenthe surface and promote early transition to turbulent ﬂow. 2.Increased turbulence in the freestream. This is particularly a problem in wind-tunnel testing; if two wind tunnels have different levels of freestreamturbulence, then data generated in one tunnel are not repeatable in the other. 3.Adverse pressure gradients. In addition to causing ﬂow-ﬁeld separation as discussed earlier, an adverse pressure gradient strongly favors transition toturbulent ﬂow. In contrast, strong favorable pressure gradients (where p decreases in the downstream direction) tend to preserve initially laminarﬂow. 4.Heating of the ﬂuid by the surface. If the surface temperature is warmer than the adjacent ﬂuid, such that heat is transferred to the ﬂuid from thesurface, the instabilities in the laminar ﬂow will be ampliﬁed, thus favoringearly transition. In contrast, a cold wall will tend to encourage laminar ﬂow. There are many other parameters which inﬂuence transition; see Reference 40for a more extensive discussion. Among these are the similarity parameters ofthe ﬂow, principally Mach number and Reynolds number. High values of M ∞ and low values of Re tend to encourage laminar ﬂow; hence, for high-altitudehypersonic ﬂight, laminar ﬂow can be quite extensive. The Reynolds numberitself is a dominant factor in transition to turbulent ﬂow. Referring to Figure 15.8,CHAPTER 15 Introduction to the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Viscous Flow 935 we deﬁne a critical Reynolds number, Re cr, as Recr≡ρ∞V∞xcr μ∞ The value of Re crfor a given body under speciﬁed conditions is difﬁcult to predict; indeed, the analysis of transition is still a very active area of modern aerodynamic research. As a rule of thumb in practical applications, we frequently take Re cr≈ 500,000; if the ﬂow at a given xstation is such that Re =ρ∞V∞x/μ∞is consid- erably below 500,000, then the ﬂow at that station is most likely laminar, and ifthe value of Re is much larger than 500,000, then the ﬂow is most likely turbulent. To obtain a better feeling for Re cr, let us imagine that the ﬂat plate in Fig- ure 15.8 is a wind-tunnel model. Assume that we carry out an experiment understandard sea level conditions [ρ ∞=1.23 kg/m3andμ∞=1.79×10−5kg/(m ·s)] andmeasure x crfor a certain freestream velocity; for example, say that xcr= 0.05 m when V∞=120 m/s. In turn, this measured value of xcrdetermines the measured Re cras Recr=ρ∞V∞xcr μ∞=1.23(120)(0.05) 1.79×10−5=412,000 Hence, for the given ﬂow conditions and the surface characteristics of the ﬂatplate, transition will occur whenever the local Re exceeds 412,000. For example,if we double V ∞, that is, V∞=240 m/s, then we will observe transition to occur atxcr=0.05/2 =0.025 m, such that Re crremains the same value of 412,000. This brings to an end our introductory qualitative discussion of viscous ﬂow. The physical principles and trends discussed in this section are very important,and you should study them carefully and feel comfortable with them beforeprogressing further. 15.3 VISCOSITY AND THERMAL CONDUCTION The basic physical phenomena of viscosity and thermal conduction in a ﬂuidare due to the transport of momentum and energy via random molecular motion.Each molecule in a ﬂuid has momentum and energy, which it carries with it whenit moves from one location to another in space before colliding with anothermolecule. The transport of molecular momentum gives rise to the macroscopiceffect we call viscosity, and the transport of molecular energy gives rise to themacroscopic effect we call thermal conduction. This is why viscosity and thermalconduction are labeled as transport phenomena. A study of these transport phe- nomena at the molecular level is part of kinetic theory, which is beyond the scopeof this book. Instead, in this section we simply state the macroscopic results ofsuch molecular motion. Consider the ﬂow sketched in Figure 15.9. For simplicity, we consider a one- dimensional shear ﬂow, that is, a ﬂow with horizontal streamlines in the xdirection but with gradients in the ydirection of velocity, ∂u/∂y, and temperature, ∂T/∂y.936 PART 4Viscous Flow Figure 15.9 Relationship of shear stress and thermal conduction to velocity and temperature gradients, respectively. Consider a plane abperpendicular to the yaxis, as shown in Figure 15.9. The shear stress exerted on plane abby the ﬂow is denoted by τyxand is proportional to the velocity gradient in the ydirection, τyx∝∂u/∂y. The constant of proportionality is deﬁned as the viscosity coefﬁcient μ. Hence, τyx=μ∂u ∂y(15.1) The subscripts on τyxdenote that the shear stress is acting in the xdirection and is being exerted on a plane perpendicular to the yaxis. The velocity gradient ∂u/∂yis also taken perpendicular to this plane (i.e., in the ydirection). The dimensions of μare mass/length ×time, as originally stated in Section 1.7 and as can be seen from Equation (15.1). In addition, the time rate of heat conducted per unit area across plane abin Figure 15.9 is denoted by ˙qyand is proportional to the temperature gradient in the ydirection, ˙qy∝∂T/∂y. The constant of proportionality is deﬁned as the thermal conductivity k . Hence, ˙qy=−k∂T ∂y(15.2) where the minus sign accounts for the fact that the heat is transferred from aregion of high temperature to a region of lower temperature; that is, ˙q yis in the opposite direction of the temperature gradient. The dimensions of kare mass × length/(s2·K), which can be obtained from Equation (15.2) keeping in mind that ˙qyis energy per second per unit area. Bothμandkare physical properties of the ﬂuid and, for most normal situa- tions, are functions of temperature only. A conventional relation for the temper-ature variation of μfor air is given by Sutherland’s law, μ μ0=/parenleftbiggT T0/parenrightbigg3/2T0+110 T+110(15.3)CHAPTER 15 Introduction to the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Viscous Flow 937 where Tis in kelvin and μ0is a reference viscosity at a reference temperature, T0. For example, if we choose reference conditions to be standard sea level val- ues, then μ0=1.7894 ×10−5kg/(m ·s)andT0=288.16 K. The temperature variation of kis analogous to Equation (15.3) because the results of elementary kinetic theory show that k∝μcp; for air at standard conditions, k=1.45μc p (15.4) where cp=1000 J/(kg ·K). Equations (15.3) and (15.4) are only approximate and do not hold at high temperatures. They are given here as representative expressions which are handy to use. For any detailed viscous ﬂow calculation, you should consult the publishedliterature for more precise values of μandk. In order to simplify our introduction of the relation between shear stress and viscosity, we considered the case of a one-dimensional shear ﬂow in Figure 15.9.In this picture, the yandzcomponents of velocity, vandw, respectively, are zero. However, in a general three-dimensional ﬂow, u,v, andware ﬁnite, and this requires a generalization of our treatment of stress in the ﬂuid. Consider theﬂuid element sketched in Figure 15.10. In a three-dimensional ﬂow, each face ofthe ﬂuid element experiences both tangential and normal stresses. For example,on face abcd,τ xyandτxzare the tangential stresses, and τxxis the normal stress. As before, the nomenclature τijdenotes a stress in the jdirection exerted on a plane perpendicular to the iaxis. Similarly, on face abfe, we have the tangential stresses τyxandτyz, and the normal stress τyy. On face adge, we have the tangential stresses τzxandτzy, and the normal stress τzz. Now recall the discussion in the last part of Section 2.12 concerning the strain of a ﬂuid element, that is, the change in the angle κshown in Figure 2.33. What is the force which causes this deformation shown in Figure 2.33? Returning to Figure 15.10, we have to say that the strain Figure 15.10 Shear and normal stresses caused by viscous action on a ﬂuid element.938 PART 4Viscous Flow is caused by the tangential shear stress. However, in contrast to solid mechanics where stress is proportional to strain, in ﬂuid mechanics the stress is proportionalto the time rate of strain. The time rate of strain in the xyplane was given in Section 2.12 as Equation (2.135 a): ε xy=∂v ∂x+∂u ∂y(2.135a) Examining Figure 15.10, the strain in the xyplane must be carried out by τxyand τyx. Moreover, we assume that moments on the ﬂuid element in Figure 15.10 are zero; hence, τxy=τyx. Finally, from the above, we know that τxy=τyx∝εxy. The proportionality constant is the viscosity coefﬁcient μ. Hence, from Equa- tion (2.135 a), we have τxy=τyx=μ/parenleftbigg∂v ∂x+∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg (15.5) which is a generalization of Equation (15.1), extended to the case of multidimen-sional ﬂow. For the shear stresses in the other planes, Equations (2.135b andc) yield τ yz=τzy=μ/parenleftbigg∂w ∂y+∂v ∂z/parenrightbigg (15.6) and τzx=τxz=μ/parenleftbigg∂u ∂z+∂w ∂x/parenrightbigg (15.7) The normal stresses τxx,τyy, andτzzshown in Figure 15.10 may at ﬁrst seem strange. In our previous treatments of inviscid ﬂow, the only force normal to asurface in a ﬂuid is the pressure force. However, if the gradients in velocity ∂u/∂x, ∂v/∂ y, and∂w/∂ zareextremely large on the faces of the ﬂuid element, there can be a meaningful viscous-induced normal force on each face which acts in addition tothe pressure. These normal stresses act to compress or expand the ﬂuid element, hence changing its volume. Recall from Section 2.12 that the derivatives ∂u/∂x, ∂v/∂ y, and∂w/∂ zare related to the dilatation of a ﬂuid element, that is, to ∇·V. Hence, the normal stresses should in turn be related to these derivatives. Indeed,it can be shown that τ xx=λ(∇·V)+2μ∂u ∂x(15.8) τyy=λ(∇·V)+2μ∂v ∂y(15.9) τzz=λ(∇·V)+2μ∂w ∂z(15.10) In Equations (15.8) to (15.10), λis called the bulk viscosity coefﬁcient, sometimes identiﬁed as the second viscosity coefﬁcient. In 1845, the Englishman GeorgeStokes hypothesized that λ=− 2 3μ (15.11)CHAPTER 15 Introduction to the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Viscous Flow 939 To this day, the correct expression for the bulk viscosity is still somewhat con- troversial, and so we continue to use the above expression given by Stokes. Onceagain, the normal stresses are important only where the derivatives ∂u/∂x,∂v/∂ y, and∂w/∂ zare very large. For most practical ﬂow problems, τ xx,τyy, andτzzare small, and hence the uncertainty regarding λis essentially an academic question. An example where the normal stress is important is inside the internal structureof a shock wave. Recall that, in real life, shock waves have a ﬁnite but smallthickness. If we consider a normal shock wave across which large changes invelocity occur over a small distance (typically 10 −5cm), then clearly ∂u/∂xwill be very large, and τxxbecomes important inside the shock wave. To this point in our discussion, the transport coefﬁcients μandkhave been considered molecular phenomena, involving the transport of momentum and en-ergy by random molecular motion. This molecular picture prevails in a laminarﬂow. The values of μandkare physical properties of the ﬂuid; that is, their values for different gases can be found in standard reference sources, such as theHandbook of Chemistry and Physics (The Chemical Rubber Co.). In contrast, for a turbulent ﬂow the transport of momentum and energy can also take place byrandom motion of large turbulent eddies, or globs of ﬂuid. This turbulent trans-port gives rise to effective values of viscosity and thermal conductivity deﬁnedaseddy viscosity εandeddy thermal conductivity κ, respectively. (Please do not confuse this use of the symbols εandκwith the time rate of strain and strain itself, as used earlier.) These turbulent transport coefﬁcients εandκcan be much larger (typically 10 to 100 times larger) than the respective molecular values μ andk. Moreover, εandκpredominantly depend on characteristics of the ﬂow ﬁeld, such as velocity gradients; they are not just a molecular property of theﬂuid such as μandk. The proper calculation of εandκfor a given ﬂow has remained a state-of-the-art research question for the past 80 years; indeed, theattempt to model the complexities of turbulence by deﬁning an eddy viscosity andthermal conductivity is even questionable. The details and basic understandingof turbulence remain one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics today. Forour purpose here, we simply adopt the ideas of eddy viscosity and eddy thermalconductivity, and for the transport of momentum and energy in a turbulent ﬂow,we replace μandkin Equations (15.1) to (15.10) by the combination μ+εand k+κ; that is, τ yx=(μ+ε)/parenleftbigg∂v ∂x+∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg ˙qy=−(k+κ)∂T ∂y An example of the calculation of εandκis as follows. In 1925, Prandtl suggested that ε=ρl2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle∂u ∂y/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle (15.12)940 PART 4Viscous Flow for a ﬂow where the dominant velocity gradient is in the ydirection. In Equa- tion (15.12), lis called the mixing length, which is different for different applications; it is an empirical constant which must be obtained from exper- iment. Indeed, allturbulence models require the input of empirical data; no self-contained purely theoretical turbulence model exists today. Prandtl’s mixinglength theory, embodied in Equation (15.12), is a simple relation which appearsto be adequate for a number of engineering problems. For these reasons, the mix-ing length model for εhas been used extensively since 1925. In regard to κ,a relation similar to Equation (15.4) can be assumed (using 1.0 for the constant);that is, κ=εc p (15.13) The comments on eddy viscosity and thermal conductivity are purely intro- ductory. The modern aerodynamicist has a whole stable of turbulence models tochoose from, and before tackling the analysis of a turbulent ﬂow, you should befamiliar with the modern approaches described in such books as References 40to 43. 15.4 THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS In Chapter 2, Newton’s second law was applied to obtain the ﬂuid-ﬂow momen-tum equation in both integral and differential forms. In particular, recall Equa-tions (2.13 atoc), where the inﬂuence of viscous forces was expressed simply by the generic terms (F x)viscous ,(Fy)viscous , and(Fz)viscous . The purpose of this section is to obtain the analogous forms of Equations (2.13 atoc) where the viscous forces are expressed explicitly in terms of the appropriate ﬂow-ﬁeld vari-ables. The resulting equations are called the Navier-Stokes equations—probably the most pivotal equations in all of theoretical ﬂuid dynamics. In Section 2.3, we discussed the philosophy behind the derivation of the governing equations, namely, certain physical principles are applied to a suitablemodel of the ﬂuid ﬂow. Moreover, we saw that such a model could be either a ﬁnite control volume (moving or ﬁxed in space) or an inﬁnitesimally smallelement (moving or ﬁxed in space). In Chapter 2, we chose the ﬁxed, ﬁnite controlvolume for our model and obtained integral forms of the continuity, momentum,and energy equations directly from this model. Then, indirectly, we went on toextract partial differential equations from the integral forms. Before progressingfurther, it would be wise for you to review these matters from Chapter 2. For the sake of variety, let us not use the ﬁxed, ﬁnite control volume employed in Chapter 2; rather, in this section, let us adopt an inﬁnitesimally small movingﬂuid element of ﬁxed mass as our model of the ﬂow, as sketched in Figure 15.11.To this model let us apply Newton’s second law in the form F=ma. Moreover, for the time being consider only the xcomponent of Newton’s second law: F x=ma x (15.14)CHAPTER 15 Introduction to the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Viscous Flow 941 Figure 15.11 Inﬁnitesimally small, moving ﬂuid element. Only the forces in the xdirection are shown. In Equation (15.14), Fxis the sum of all the body and surface forces acting on the ﬂuid element in the xdirection. Let us ignore body forces; hence, the net force acting on the element in Figure 15.11 is simply due to the pressure and viscous stress distributions over the surface of the element. For example, on faceabcd, the only force in the xdirection is that due to shear stress, τ yxdx dz . Face efgh is a distance dyabove face abcd ; hence, the shear force in the xdirection on face efgh is [τ yx+(∂τ yx/∂y)dy]dx dz . Note the directions of the shear stress on faces abcd andefgh; on the bottom face, τyxis to the left (the negative x direction), whereas on the top face, τyx+(∂τ yx/∂y)dyis to the right (the positive xdirection). These directions are due to the convention that positive increases in all three components of velocity, u,v, andw, occur in the positive directions of the axes. For example, in Figure 15.11, uincreases in the positive ydirection. Therefore, concentrating on face efgh, uis higher just above the face than on the face; this causes a “tugging” action which tries to pull the ﬂuid element in thepositive xdirection (to the right) as shown in Figure 15.11. In turn, concentrating on face abcd, uis lower just beneath the face than on the face; this causes a retarding or dragging action on the ﬂuid element, which acts in the negative x direction (to the left), as shown in Figure 15.11. The directions of all the otherviscous stresses shown in Figure 15.11, including τ xx, can be justiﬁed in a like fashion. Speciﬁcally, on face dcgh,τzxacts in the negative xdirection, whereas on face abfe,τzx+(∂τ zx/∂z)dzacts in the positive xdirection. On face adhe,942 PART 4Viscous Flow which is perpendicular to the xaxis, the only forces in the xdirection are the pressure force pdy dz , which always acts in the direction intothe ﬂuid element, andτxxdy dz , which is in the negative xdirection. In Figure 15.11, the reason whyτxxon face adhe is to the left hinges on the convention mentioned earlier for the direction of increasing velocity. Here, by convention, a positive increase in u takes place in the positive xdirection. Hence, the value of ujust to the left of face adhe is smaller than the value of uon the face itself. As a result, the viscous action of the normal stress acts as a “suction” on face adhe; that is, there is a dragging action toward the left that wants to retard the motion of the ﬂuid element. In contrast, on face bcgf, the pressure force [ p+(∂p/∂x)dx]dy dz presses inward on the ﬂuid element (in the negative xdirection), and because the value of ujust to the right of face bcgf is larger than the value of uon the face, there is a “suction” due to the viscous normal stress which tries to pull the element to the right (in thepositive xdirection) with a force equal to [τ xx+(∂τ xx/∂x)dx]dy dz . Return to Equation (15.14). Examining Figure 15.11 in light of our previous discussion, we can write for the net force in the xdirection acting on the ﬂuid element: Fx=/bracketleftbigg p−/parenleftbigg p+∂p ∂xdx/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg dy dz +/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg τxx+∂τxx ∂xdx/parenrightbigg −τxx/bracketrightbigg dy dz +/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg τyx+∂τyx ∂ydy/parenrightbigg −τyx/bracketrightbigg dx dz +/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg τzx+∂τzx ∂zdz/parenrightbigg −τzx/bracketrightbigg dx dy or Fx=/parenleftbigg −∂p ∂x+∂τxx ∂x+∂τyx ∂y+∂τzx ∂z/parenrightbigg dx dydz (15.15) Equation (15.15) represents the left-hand side of Equation (15.14). Consideringthe right-hand side of Equation (15.14), recall that the mass of the ﬂuid elementis ﬁxed and is equal to m=ρdx dydz (15.16) Also, recall that the acceleration of the ﬂuid element is the time rate of changeof its velocity. Hence, the component of acceleration in the xdirection, denoted bya x, is simply the time rate of change of u; since we are following a moving ﬂuid element, this time rate of change is given by the substantial derivative (see Section 2.9 for a review of the meaning of substantial derivative). Thus, ax=Du Dt(15.17) Combining Equations (15.14) to (15.17), we obtain ρDu Dt=−∂p ∂x+∂τxx ∂x+∂τyx ∂y+∂τzx ∂z(15.18a)CHAPTER 15 Introduction to the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Viscous Flow 943 which is the xcomponent of the momentum equation for a viscous ﬂow. In a similar fashion, the yandzcomponents can be obtained as ρDv Dt=−∂p ∂y+∂τxy ∂x+∂τyy ∂y+∂τzy ∂z(15.18b) ρDw Dt=−∂p ∂z+∂τxz ∂x+∂τyz ∂y+∂τzz ∂z(15.18c) Equations (15.18 atoc) are the momentum equations in the x,y, and zdirec- tions, respectively. They are scalar equations and are called the Navier-Stokes equations in honor of two men—the Frenchman M. Navier and the Englishman G. Stokes—who independently obtained the equations in the ﬁrst half of thenineteenth century. With the expressions for τ xy=τyx,τyz=τzy,τzx=τxz,τxx,τyy, andτzz from Equations (15.5) to (15.10), the Navier-Stokes equations, Equations (15.18 a toc), can be written as ρ∂u ∂t+ρu∂u ∂x+ρv∂u ∂y+ρw∂u ∂z=−∂p ∂x+∂ ∂x/parenleftbigg λ∇·V+2μ∂u ∂x/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/bracketleftbigg μ/parenleftbigg∂v ∂x+∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg +∂ ∂z/bracketleftbigg μ/parenleftbigg∂u ∂z+∂w ∂x/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (15.19a) ρ∂v ∂t+ρu∂v ∂x+ρv∂v ∂y+ρw∂v ∂z=−∂p ∂y+∂ ∂x/bracketleftbigg μ/parenleftbigg∂v ∂x+∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg +∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg λ∇·V+2μ∂v ∂y/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂z/bracketleftbigg μ/parenleftbigg∂w ∂y+∂v ∂z/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (15.19b) ρ∂w ∂t+ρu∂w ∂x+ρv∂w ∂y+ρw∂w ∂z=−∂p ∂z+∂ ∂x/bracketleftbigg μ/parenleftbigg∂u ∂z+∂w ∂x/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg +∂ ∂y/bracketleftbigg μ/parenleftbigg∂w ∂y+∂v ∂z/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg +∂ ∂z/parenleftbigg λ∇·V+2μ∂w ∂z/parenrightbigg (15.19c) Equations (15.19 atoc) represent the complete Navier-Stokes equations for an unsteady, compressible, three-dimensional viscous ﬂow. To analyze incompress-ible viscous ﬂow, Equations (15.19 atoc) and the continuity equation [say, Equa- tion (2.52)] are sufﬁcient. However, for a compressible ﬂow, we need an additionalequation, namely, the energy equation to be discussed in the next section.944 PART 4Viscous Flow In the above form, the Navier-Stokes equations are suitable for the analysis of laminar ﬂow. For a turbulent ﬂow, the ﬂow variables in Equations (15.19 a toc) can be assumed to be time-mean values over the turbulent ﬂuctuations, and μcan be replaced by μ+ε, as discussed in Section 15.3. For more details, see References 40 and 41. 15.5 THE VISCOUS FLOW ENERGY EQUATION The energy equation was derived in Section 2.7, where the ﬁrst law of thermo- dynamics was applied to a ﬁnite control volume ﬁxed in space. The resultingintegral form of the energy equation was given by Equation (2.95), and differen-tial forms were obtained in Equations (2.96) and (2.114). In these equations, theinﬂuence of viscous effects was expressed generically by such terms as ˙Q /prime viscous and˙W/prime viscous . It is recommended that you review Section 2.7 before progressing further. In the present section, we derive the energy equation for a viscous ﬂow using as our model an inﬁnitesimal moving ﬂuid element. This will be in keeping with our derivation of the Navier-Stokes equation in Section 15.4, where theinﬁnitesimal element was shown in Figure 15.11. In the process, we obtain explicitexpressions for ˙Q /prime viscous and˙W/prime viscous in terms of the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables. That is, we once again derive Equation (2.114), except the viscous terms are now displayed in detail. Consider again the moving ﬂuid element shown in Figure 15.11. To this element, apply the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, which states Rate of change net ﬂux of rate of workof energy inside =heat into +done on element ﬂuid element element due to pressure and stress forces on surface or A = B + C (15.20) where A,B, and Cdenote the respective terms above. Let us ﬁrst evaluate C; that is, let us obtain an expression for the rate of work done on the moving ﬂuid element due to the pressure and stress forces on thesurface of the element. (Note that we are neglecting body forces in this derivation.)These surface forces are illustrated in Figure 15.11, which for simplicity showsonly the forces in the xdirection. Recall from Section 2.7 that the rate of doing work by a force exerted on a moving body is equal to the product of the forceand the component of velocity in the direction of the force. Hence, the rate ofwork done on the moving ﬂuid element by the forces in the xdirection shown in Figure 15.11 is simply the xcomponent of velocity umultiplied by the forces; for example, on face abcd the rate of work done by τ yxdx dz isuτyxdx dz , with similar expressions for the other faces. To emphasize these energy considerations,the moving ﬂuid element is redrawn in Figure 15.12, where the rate of work doneon each face by forces in the xdirection is shown explicitly. Study this ﬁgureCHAPTER 15 Introduction to the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Viscous Flow 945 Figure 15.12 Energy ﬂuxes associated with an inﬁnitesimally small, moving ﬂuid element. For simplicity, only the ﬂuxes in the xdirection are shown. carefully, referring frequently to its companion in Figure 15.11, until you feel comfortable with the work terms given in each face. To obtain the netrate of work done on the ﬂuid element by the forces in the xdirection, note that forces in the positive xdirection do positive work and that forces in the negative xdirection do negative work. Hence, comparing the pressure forces on faces adhe andbcgf in Figure 15.12, the net rate of work done by pressure in the xdirection is /bracketleftbigg up−/parenleftbigg up+∂(up) ∂xdx/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg dy dz =−∂(up) ∂xdx dydz Similarly, the net rate of work done by the shear stresses in the xdirection on faces abcd andefgh is /bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg uτyx+∂(uτyx) ∂ydy/parenrightbigg −uτyx/bracketrightbigg dx dz =∂(uτyx) ∂ydx dydz Considering all the forces shown in Figure 15.12, the net rate of work done onthe moving ﬂuid element is simply /bracketleftbigg −∂(up) ∂x+∂(uτxx) ∂x+∂(uτyx) ∂y+∂(uτzx) ∂z/bracketrightbigg dx dydz The above expression considers only forces in the xdirection. When the forces in the yandzdirections are also included, similar expressions are obtained (draw some pictures and obtain these expressions yourself). In total, the net rate of workdone on the moving ﬂuid element is the sum of all contributions in the x,y, and946 PART 4Viscous Flow zdirections; this is denoted by Cin Equation (15.20) and is given by C=/bracketleftbigg −/parenleftbigg∂(up) ∂x+∂(vp) ∂y+∂(wp) ∂z/parenrightbigg +∂(uτxx) ∂x+∂(uτyx) ∂y(15.21) +∂(uτzx) ∂z+∂(vτ xy) ∂x+∂(vτ yy) ∂y+∂(vτ zy) ∂z+∂(wτ xz) ∂x +∂(wτ yz) ∂y+∂(wτ zz) ∂z/bracketrightbigg dx dydz Note in Equation (15.21) that the term in large parentheses is simply ∇·pV. Let us turn our attention to Bin Equation (15.20), that is, the net ﬂux of heat into the element. This heat ﬂux is due to (1) volumetric heating such as absorption or emission of radiation and (2) heat transfer across the surface due to temperaturegradients (i.e., thermal conduction). Let us treat the volumetric heating the sameas was done in Section 2.7; that is, deﬁne ˙qas the rate of volumetric heat addition per unit mass. Noting that the mass of the moving ﬂuid element in Figure 15.12isρdx dydz , we obtain V olumetric heating of element =ρ˙q dx dy dz (15.22) Thermal conduction was discussed in Section 15.3. In Figure 15.12, the heattransferred by thermal conduction into the moving ﬂuid element across face adhe is˙q xdy dz , and the heat transferred out of the element across face bcgf is [˙qx+ (∂˙qx/∂x)dx]dy dz . Thus, the net heat transferred in the xdirection into the ﬂuid element by thermal conduction is /bracketleftbigg ˙qx−/parenleftbigg ˙qx+∂˙qx ∂xdx/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg dy dz =−∂˙qx ∂xdx dydz Taking into account heat transfer in the yandzdirections across the other faces in Figure 15.12, we obtain Heating of ﬂuid elementby thermal conduction=−/parenleftbigg∂˙qx ∂x+∂˙qy ∂y+∂˙qz ∂z/parenrightbigg dx dydz (15.23) The term Bin Equation (15.20) is the sum of Equations (15.22) and (15.23). Also, recalling that thermal conduction is proportional to temperature gradient,as exempliﬁed by Equation (15.2), we have B=/bracketleftbigg ρ˙q+∂ ∂x/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂x/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂z/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂z/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg dx dydz (15.24) Finally, the term Ain Equation (15.20) denotes the time rate of change of energy of the ﬂuid element. In Section 2.7, we stated that the energy of a movingﬂuid per unit mass is the sum of the internal and kinetic energies, for example,e+V 2/2. Since we are following a moving ﬂuid element, the time rate of change of energy per unit mass is given by the substantial derivative (see Section 2.9).CHAPTER 15 Introduction to the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Viscous Flow 947 Since the mass of the ﬂuid element is ρdx dydz , we have A=ρD Dt/parenleftbigg e+V2 2/parenrightbigg dx dydz (15.25) The ﬁnal form of the energy equation for a viscous ﬂow is obtained by substituting Equations (15.21), (15.24), and (15.25) into Equation (15.20), obtaining ρD(e+V2/2) Dt=ρ˙q+∂ ∂x/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂x/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂z/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂z/parenrightbigg −∇·pV+∂(uτxx) ∂x+∂(uτyx) ∂y +∂(uτzx) ∂z+∂(vτ xy) ∂x+∂(vτ yy) ∂y+∂(vτ zy) ∂z +∂(wτ xz) ∂x+∂(wτ yz) ∂y+∂(wτ zz) ∂z(15.26) Equation (15.26) is the general energy equation for unsteady, compressible, three-dimensional, viscous ﬂow. Compare Equation (15.26) with Equation (2.105); theviscous terms are now explicitly spelled out in Equation (15.26). [Note that thebody force term in Equation (15.26) has been neglected.] Moreover, the normaland shear stresses that appear in Equation (15.26) can be expressed in terms ofthe velocity ﬁeld via Equations (15.5) to (15.10). This substitution will not bemade here because the resulting equation would simply occupy too much space. Reﬂect on the viscous ﬂow equations obtained in this chapter—the Navier- Stokes equations given by Equations (15.19 atoc) and the energy equation given by Equation (15.26). These equations are obviously more complex than the invis-cid ﬂow equations dealt with in previous chapters. This underscores the fact thatviscous ﬂows are inherently more difﬁcult to analyze than inviscid ﬂows. This iswhy, in the study of aerodynamics, the student is ﬁrst introduced to the conceptsassociated with inviscid ﬂow. Moreover, this is why we attempt to model a num-ber of practical aerodynamic problems in real life as inviscid ﬂows—simply toallow a reasonable analysis of such ﬂows. However, there are many aerodynamicproblems, especially those involving the prediction of drag and ﬂow separation,which must take into account viscous effects. For the analysis of such problems,the basic equations derived in this chapter form a starting point. Question: What is the form of the continuity equation for a viscous ﬂow? To answer this question, review the derivation of the continuity equation in Sec-tion 2.4. You will note that the consideration of the viscous or inviscid natureof the ﬂow never enters the derivation—the continuity equation is simply a state-ment that mass is conserved, which is independent of whether the ﬂow is viscousor inviscid. Hence, Equation (2.52) holds in general.948 PART 4Viscous Flow 15.6 SIMILARITY PARAMETERS In Section 1.7, we introduced the concept of dimensional analysis, from which sprung the similarity parameters necessary to ensure the dynamic similarity be-tween two or more different ﬂows (see Section 1.8). In the present section, werevisit the governing similarity parameters, but cast them in a slightly differentlight. Consider a steady, two-dimensional, viscous, compressible ﬂow. The x-momentum equation for such a ﬂow is given by Equation (15.19 a), which for the present case reduces to ρu∂u ∂x+ρv∂u ∂y=−∂p ∂x+∂ ∂y/bracketleftbigg μ/parenleftbigg∂v ∂x+∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (15.27) In Equation (15.27), ρ,u,p, etc., are the actual dimensional variables, say, [ρ ]= kg/m3, etc. Let us introduce the following dimensionless variables: ρ/prime=ρ ρ∞u/prime=u V∞v/prime=v V∞p/prime=p p∞ μ/prime=μ μ∞x/prime=x cy/prime=y c where ρ∞,V∞,p∞, andμ∞are reference values (say, e.g., freestream values) and cis a reference length (say, the chord of an airfoil). In terms of these dimensionless variables, Equation (15.27) becomes ρ/primeu/prime∂u/prime ∂x/prime+ρ/primev/prime∂u/prime ∂y/prime=−/parenleftbiggp∞ ρ∞V2 ∞/parenrightbigg∂p/prime ∂x/prime+/parenleftbiggμ∞ ρ∞V∞c/parenrightbigg∂ ∂y/prime/bracketleftbigg μ/prime/parenleftbigg∂v/prime ∂x/prime+∂u/prime ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (15.28) Noting that p∞ ρ∞V2 ∞=γp∞ γρ∞V2 ∞=a2 ∞ γV2 ∞=1 γM2 ∞ andμ∞ ρ∞V∞c=1 Re∞ where M∞and Re ∞are the freestream Mach and Reynolds numbers, respectively, Equation (15.28) becomes ρ/primeu/prime∂u/prime ∂x/prime+ρ/primev/prime∂u/prime ∂y/prime=−1 γM2 ∞∂p/prime ∂x/prime+1 Re∞∂ ∂y/prime/bracketleftbigg μ/prime/parenleftbigg∂v/prime ∂x/prime+∂u/prime ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (15.29) Equation (15.29) tells us something important. Consider two different ﬂows over two bodies of different shapes. In one ﬂow, the ratio of speciﬁc heats, Machnumber, and Reynolds number are γ 1,M∞1, and Re ∞1, respectively; in the other ﬂow, these parameters have different values, γ2,M∞2, and Re ∞2. Equation (15.29) is valid for both ﬂows. It can, in principle, be solved to obtain u/primeas a function ofx/primeandy/prime. However, since γ,M∞, and Re ∞are different for the two cases,CHAPTER 15 Introduction to the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Viscous Flow 949 the coefﬁcients of the derivatives in Equation (15.29) will be different. This will ensure, if u/prime=f1(x/prime,y/prime) represents the solution for one ﬂow and u/prime=f2(x/prime,y/prime) represents the solution for the other ﬂow, that f1/negationslash=f2 However, consider now the case where the two different ﬂows have the same val- ues ofγ,M∞, and Re ∞. Now the coefﬁcients of the derivatives in Equation (15.29) will be the same for both ﬂows; that is, Equation (15.29) is numerically identical for the two ﬂows. In addition, assume the two bodies are geometrically similar,so that the boundary conditions in terms of the nondimensional variables arethe same. Then, the solutions of Equation (15.29) for the two ﬂows in terms ofu /prime=f1(x/prime,y/prime)andu/prime=f2(x/prime,y/prime)must be identical; that is, f1(x/prime,y/prime)≡f2(x/prime,y/prime) (15.30) Recall the deﬁnition of dynamically similar ﬂows given in Section 1.8. There,we stated in part that two ﬂows are dynamically similar if the distributions of V/V ∞,p/p∞, etc., are the same throughout the ﬂow ﬁeld when plotted against common nondimensional coordinates. This is precisely what Equation (15.30) issaying—that u /primeas a function of x/primeandy/primeis the same for the two ﬂows. That is, the variation of the nondimensional velocity as a function of the nondimensional coordinates is the same for the two ﬂows. How did we obtain Equation (15.30)?Simply by saying that γ,M ∞, and Re ∞are the same for the two ﬂows and that the two bodies are geometrically similar. These are precisely the criteria for two ﬂows to be dynamically similar, as originally stated in Section 1.8. What we have seen in the above derivation is a formal mechanism to identify governing similarity parameters for a ﬂow. By couching the governing ﬂow equa-tions in terms of nondimensional variables, we ﬁnd that the coefﬁcients of thederivatives in these equations are dimensionless similarity parameters or combi-nations thereof. To see this more clearly, and to extend our analysis further, consider the energy equation for a steady, two-dimensional, viscous, compressible ﬂow, whichfrom Equation (15.26) can be written as (assuming no volumetric heating andneglecting the normal stresses) ρu∂(e+V 2/2) ∂x+ρv∂(e+V2/2) ∂y=∂ ∂x/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂x/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg −∂(up) ∂x −∂(vp) ∂y+∂(vτ xy) ∂x+∂(uτyx) ∂y(15.31)950 PART 4Viscous Flow Substituting Equation (15.5) into (15.31), we have ρu∂(e+V2/2) ∂x+ρv∂(e+V2/2) ∂y=∂ ∂x/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂x/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg (15.32) −∂(up) ∂x−∂(vp) ∂y +∂ ∂x/bracketleftbigg μv/parenleftbigg∂v ∂x+∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg +∂ ∂y/bracketleftbigg μu/parenleftbigg∂v ∂x+∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg Using the same nondimensional variables as before, and introducing e/prime=e cvT∞k/prime=k k∞V/prime2=V2 V2 ∞=u2+v2 V2 ∞=(u/prime)2+(v/prime)2 Equation (15.32) can be written as ρ∞V∞cvT∞ c/parenleftbigg ρ/primeu/prime∂e/prime ∂x/prime+ρ/primev/prime∂e/prime ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg =−ρ∞V3 ∞ 2c/bracketleftbigg ρ/primeu/prime∂ ∂x/prime(u/prime2+v/prime2)+ρ/primev/prime∂ ∂y/prime(u/prime2+v/prime2)/bracketrightbigg +k∞T∞ c2/bracketleftbigg∂ ∂x/prime/parenleftbigg k/prime∂T/prime ∂x/prime/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/prime/parenleftbigg k/prime∂T/prime ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg −V∞p∞ c/parenleftbigg∂(u/primep/prime) ∂x/prime+∂(v/primep/prime) ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg +μ∞V2 ∞ c2/braceleftbigg∂ ∂x/prime/bracketleftbigg μ/primev/prime/parenleftbigg∂v/prime ∂x/prime+∂u/prime ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg +∂ ∂y/prime/bracketleftbigg μ/primeu/prime/parenleftbigg∂v/prime ∂x/prime+∂u/prime ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg/bracerightbigg orρ/primeu/prime∂e/prime ∂x/prime+ρ/primev/prime∂e/prime ∂y/prime=V2 ∞ 2cvT∞/bracketleftbigg ρ/primeu/prime∂ ∂x/prime(u/prime2+v/prime2) (15.32a) +ρ/primev/prime∂ ∂y/prime(u/prime2+v/prime2)/bracketrightbigg +k∞ cρ∞V∞cv/bracketleftbigg∂ ∂x/prime/parenleftbigg k/prime∂T/prime ∂x/prime/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/prime/parenleftbigg k/prime∂T/prime ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg −p∞ ρ∞cvT∞/parenleftbigg∂(u/primep/prime) ∂x/prime+∂(v/primep/prime) ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg +μ∞V∞ cρ∞cvT∞/braceleftbigg∂ ∂x/prime/bracketleftbigg μ/primev/prime/parenleftbigg∂v/prime ∂x/prime+∂u/prime ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg +∂ ∂y/prime/bracketleftbigg μ/primeu/prime/parenleftbigg∂v/prime ∂x/prime+∂u/prime ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg/bracerightbiggCHAPTER 15 Introduction to the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Viscous Flow 951 Examining the coefﬁcients of each term on the right-hand side of Equa- tion (15.32 a), we ﬁnd, consecutively, V2 ∞ cvT∞=(γ−1)V2 ∞ RT∞=γ(γ−1)V2 ∞ γRT∞=γ(γ−1)V2 ∞ a2 ∞=γ(γ−1)M2 ∞ k∞ cρ∞V∞cv=k∞γμ∞ cρ∞V∞cpμ∞=γ Pr∞Re∞ Note: In the above, we have introduced a new dimensionless parameter, the Prandtl number, Pr∞≡μ∞cp/k∞, the signiﬁcance of which will be discussed later: p∞ ρ∞cvT∞=(γ−1)p∞ ρ∞RT∞=(γ−1)p∞ p∞=γ−1 μ∞V∞ cρ∞cvT∞=μ∞ ρ∞V∞c/parenleftbiggV2 ∞ cvT∞/parenrightbigg =1 Re∞(γ−1)V2 ∞ RT∞=γ(γ−1)M2 ∞ Re∞ Hence, Equation (15.32) can be written as ρ/primeu/prime∂e/prime ∂x/prime+ρ/primev/prime∂e/prime ∂y/prime(15.33) =γ(γ−1) 2M2 ∞/bracketleftbigg ρ/primeu/prime∂ ∂x/prime(u/prime2+v/prime2)+ρ/primev/prime∂ ∂y/prime(u/prime2+v/prime2)/bracketrightbigg +γ Pr∞Re∞/bracketleftbigg∂ ∂x/prime/parenleftbigg k/prime∂T/prime ∂x/prime/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/prime/parenleftbigg k/prime∂T/prime ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg −(γ−1)/parenleftbigg∂(u/primep/prime) ∂x/prime+∂(v/primep/prime) ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg +γ(γ−1)M2 ∞ Re∞/braceleftbigg∂ ∂x/prime/bracketleftbigg μ/primev/prime/parenleftbigg∂v/prime ∂x/prime+∂u/prime ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg +∂ ∂y/prime/bracketleftbigg μ/primeu/prime/parenleftbigg∂v/prime ∂x/prime+∂u/prime ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg/bracerightbigg Examine Equation (15.33). It is a nondimensional equation which, in principle,can be solved for e /prime=f(x/prime,y/prime). If we have two different ﬂows, but with the same values γ,M∞, Re∞, and Pr ∞, Equation (15.33) will be numerically identical for the two ﬂows, and if we are considering geometrically similar bodies, then thesolution e /prime=f(x/prime,y/prime)will be identical for the two ﬂows. Reﬂecting upon Equations (15.29) and (15.33), which are the nondimensional x-momentum and energy equations, respectively, we clearly see that the govern- ing similarity parameters for a viscous, compressible ﬂow are γ,M∞, Re∞, and Pr∞. If the above parameters are the same for two different ﬂows with geomet- rically similar bodies, then the ﬂows are dynamically similar. We obtained theseresults by considering the x-momentum equation and the energy equation, both952 PART 4Viscous Flow in two dimensions. The same results would have occurred if we had considered three-dimensional ﬂow and the y- and z-momentum equations. Note that the similarity parameters γ,M∞, and Re ∞were obtained from the momentum equation. When the energy equation is considered, an additionalsimilarity parameter is introduced, namely, the Prandtl number. On a physicalbasis, the Prandtl number is an index which is proportional to the ratio of energydissipated by friction to the energy transported by thermal conduction; that is, Pr=μ ∞cp k∝frictional dissipation thermal conduction In the study of compressible, viscous ﬂow, Prandtl number is just as important asγ, Re ∞, orM∞. For air at standard conditions, Pr ∞=0.71. Note that Pr ∞is a property of the gas. For different gases, Pr ∞is different. Also, like μandk, Pr∞ is, in general, a function of temperature; however, for air over a reasonable tem-perature range (up to T ∞=600 K), it is safe to assume Pr ∞=constant =0.71. 15.7 SOLUTIONS OF VISCOUS FLOWS: A PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION The governing continuity, momentum, and energy equations for a generalunsteady, compressible, viscous, three-dimensional ﬂow are given by Equa-tions (2.52), (15.19 atoc), and (15.26), respectively. Examine these equations closely. They are nonlinear, coupled, partial differential equations. Moreover,they have additional terms—namely, the viscous terms—in comparison to theanalogous equations for an inviscid ﬂow treated in Part 3. Since we have alreadyseen that the nonlinear inviscid ﬂow equations do not lend themselves to a generalanalytical solution, we can certainly expect the viscous ﬂow equations also not tohave any general solutions (at least, at the time of this writing, no general analyt-ical solutions have been found). This leads to the following question: How, then,can we make use of the viscous ﬂow equations in order to obtain some practicalresults? The answer is much like our approach to the solution of inviscid ﬂows.We have the following options: 1.There are a few viscous ﬂow problems which, by their physical and geometrical nature, allow many terms in the Navier-Stokes solutions to beprecisely zero, with the resulting equations being simple enough to solve,either analytically or by simple numerical methods. Sometimes this classof solutions is called “exact solutions” of the Navier-Stokes equations,because no simplifying approximations are made to reduce the equations—just precise conditions are applied to reduce the equations. Chapter 16 is devoted to this class of solutions; an example is Couette ﬂow(to be deﬁned later). 2.We can simplify the equations by treating certain classes of physicalproblems for which some terms in the viscous ﬂow equations are small andcan be neglected. This is an approximation, not a precise condition. Theboundary-layer equations developed and discussed in Chapter 17 are a caseCHAPTER 15 Introduction to the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Viscous Flow 953 in point. However, as we will see, the boundary-layer equations may be simpler than the full viscous ﬂow equations, but they are still nonlinear. 3.We can tackle the solution of the full viscous ﬂow equations by modernnumerical techniques. For example, some of the computational ﬂuiddynamic algorithms discussed in Chapter 13 in conjunction with “exact”solutions for the inviscid ﬂow equations carry over to exact solutions for theviscous ﬂow equations. These matters will be discussed in Chapter 20. There are some inherent very important differences between the analysis of viscous ﬂows and the study of inviscid ﬂows that were presented in Parts 2 and The remainder of this section highlights these differences. First, we have already demonstrated in Example 2.5 that viscous ﬂows are rotational ﬂows. Therefore, a velocity potential cannot be deﬁned for a viscousﬂow, thus losing the attendant advantages that were discussed in Sections 2.15and 11.2. On the other hand, a stream function can be deﬁned, because the streamfunction satisﬁes the continuity equation and has nothing to do with the ﬂowbeing rotational or irrotational (see Section 2.14). Second, the boundary condition at a solid surface for a viscous ﬂow is the no-slip condition. Due to the presence of friction between the surface material and the adjacent layer of ﬂuid, the ﬂuid velocity right at the surface is zero. Thisno-slip condition was discussed in Section 15.2. For example, if the surface islocated at y=0 in a cartesian coordinate system, then the no-slip boundary condition on velocity is At y=0: u=0 v=0 w=0 This is in contrast to the analogous boundary condition for an inviscid ﬂow, namely, the ﬂow-tangency condition at a surface as discussed in Section 3.7,where only the component of the velocity normal to the surface is zero. Also, recallthat for an inviscid ﬂow, there is no boundary condition on the temperature; thetemperature of the gas adjacent to a solid surface in an inviscid ﬂow is governed bythe physics of the ﬂow ﬁeld and has no connection whatsoever with the actual walltemperature. However, for a viscous ﬂow, the mechanism of thermal conductionensures that the temperature of the ﬂuid immediately adjacent to the surfaceis the same as the temperature of the material surface. In this respect, the no-slip condition is more general than that applied to the velocity; in addition tou=v=0 at the wall, we also have T=T wat the wall, where Tis the gas temperature immediately adjacent to the wall and Twis the temperature of the surface material. Thus, At y=0: T=Tw (15.34) In many problems, Twis speciﬁed and held constant; this boundary condition is easily applied. However, consider the following, more general case. Imagine a viscous ﬂow over a surface where heat is being transferred from the gas to thesurface, or vice versa. Also, assume that the surface is at a certain temperature, T w, when the ﬂow ﬁrst starts, but that Twchanges as a function of time as the surface is either heated or cooled by the ﬂow [i.e., Tw=Tw(t)]. Because this timewise954 PART 4Viscous Flow variation is dictated in part by the ﬂow which is being calculated, Twbecomes an unknown in the problem and must be calculated along with the solution of the viscous ﬂow. For this general case, the boundary condition at the surface isobtained from Equation (15.2) applied at the wall; that is, At y=0: ˙q w=−/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg w(15.35) Here, the surface material is responding to the heat transfer to the wall ˙qw, hence changing Tw, which in turn affects ˙qw. This general, unsteady heat transfer prob- lem must be solved by treating the viscous ﬂow and the thermal response of the material simultaneously. This problem is beyond the scope of the present book. Finally, let us imagine the above, unsteady case carried out to the limit of large times. That is, imagine a wind-tunnel model which is at room temperaturesuddenly inserted in a supersonic or hypersonic stream. At early times, say, forthe ﬁrst few seconds, the surface temperature remains relatively cool, and theassumption of constant wall temperature T wis reasonable [Equation (15.34)]. However, due to the heat transfer to the model [Equation (15.35)], the surfacetemperature soon starts to increase and becomes a function of time, as discussedin the previous paragraph. However, as T wincreases, the heating rate decreases. Finally, at large times, Twincreases to a high enough value that the net heat transfer rate to the surface becomes zero, that is, from Equation (15.35), ˙qw=−/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg w=0 or/parenleftbigg∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg w=0 (15.36) When the situation of zero heat transfer is achieved, a state of equilibrium exists;the wall temperature at which this occurs is, by deﬁnition, the equilibrium walltemperature, or, as it is more commonly denoted, the adiabatic wall temperature, T aw. Hence, for the case of an adiabatic wall (no heat transfer), the wall boundary condition is given by Equation (15.36). In summary, for the wall boundary condition associated with the solution of the energy equation [Equation (15.26)], we have three possible cases: 1.Constant temperature wall, where T wis a speciﬁed constant [Equation (15.34)]. For this given wall temperature, the temperature gradient at the wall (∂T/∂y)wis obtained as part of the ﬂow-ﬁeld solution and allows the direct calculation of the aerodynamic heating to the wall viaEquation (15.35). 2.The general, unsteady case, where the heat transfer to the wall ˙q wcauses the wall temperature T wto change, which in turn causes ˙qwto change Here, both Twand(∂T/∂y)wchange as a function of time, and the problem must be solved by treating jointly the viscous ﬂow as well as the thermalresponse of the wall material (which usually implies a separate thermalconduction heat transfer numerical analysis).CHAPTER 15 Introduction to the Fundamental Principles and Equations of Viscous Flow 955 3.The adiabatic wall case (zero heat transfer), where (∂T/∂y)w=0 [Equation (15.36)]. Here, the boundary condition is applied to the temperature gradient at the wall, not to the wall temperature itself. Indeed, the wall temperature for this case is deﬁned as the adiabatic walltemperature T awand is obtained as part of the ﬂow-ﬁeld solution. Finally, we emphasize again that, from the point of view of applied aerody- namics, the practical results obtained from a viscous ﬂow analysis are the skinfriction and heat transfer at the surface. However, to obtain these quantities, weusually need a complete solution of the viscous ﬂow ﬁeld; among the data obtainedfrom such a solution are the velocity and temperature gradients at the wall. These,in turn, allow the direct calculation of τ wand˙qwfrom τw=μ/parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg w and ˙qw=−k/parenleftbigg∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg w Another practical result provided by a viscous ﬂow analysis is the predictionand calculation of ﬂow separation; we have discussed numerous cases in thepreceding chapters where the pressure ﬁeld around an aerodynamic body can begreatly changed by ﬂow separation; the ﬂows over cylinders and spheres (seeSections 3.18 and 6.6) are cases in point. Clearly, the study of viscous ﬂow is important within the entire scope of aerodynamics. The purpose of the following chapters is to provide an introductionto such ﬂows. We will organize our study following the three options itemizedat the beginning of this section; that is, we will treat, in turn, certain specialized“exact” solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, boundary-layer solutions, andthen “exact” numerical solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. In so doing, wehope that the reader will gain an overall, introductory picture of the whole areaof viscous ﬂow. Entire books have been written on this subject, see, for example,References 40 and 41. We cannot possibly present such detail here; rather, ourobjective is simply to provide a “feel” for and a basic understanding of the material.Let us proceed. 15.8 SUMMARY We have now completed the road map given in Figure 15.1. The main results ofthis chapter are summarized below: Shear stress and ﬂow separation are two major ramiﬁcations of viscous ﬂow.Shear stress is the cause of skin friction drag D f, and ﬂow separation is the source of pressure drag Dp, sometimes called form drag. Transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow causes Dfto increase and Dpto decrease.956 PART 4Viscous Flow Shear stress in a ﬂow is due to velocity gradients: for example, τyx=μ∂u/∂y for a ﬂow with gradients in the ydirection. Similarly, heat conduction is due to temperature gradients; for example, ˙qy=−k∂T/∂y, etc. Both μandkare physical properties of the gas and are functions of temperature.

For a vis-cous, compressible ﬂow, the main similarity parameters are γ,M ∞, Re ∞, and Pr ∞. Exact analytical solutions of the complete Navier-Stokes equations exist foronly a few very specialized cases. Instead, the equations are frequently simpli-ﬁed by making appropriate approximations about the ﬂow. In modern times,exact solutions of the complete Navier-Stokes equations for many practicalproblems can be obtained numerically, using various techniques of computa-tional ﬂuid dynamics. 15.9 PROBLEMS 15.1 Consider the incompressible viscous ﬂow of air between two inﬁnitelylong parallel plates separated by a distance h.

Isaac Newton, 1687,from Section IX of Book IIof his Principia PREVIEW BOX An old but wise expression states that you must learn to walk before you can run. General applica-tions of viscous ﬂow are frequently complex andchallenging—you are constantly “running” in orderto obtain their solutions. This chapter teaches you towalk ﬁrst. Here we treat a special viscous ﬂow prob-lem that lends itself to rather straightforward solu-tions (all we have to do is “walk” to obtain them).Yet these solutions illustrate some of the most im-portant aspects of viscous ﬂows in general, obtain-ing and highlighting the parameters that dictate skinfriction and aerodynamic heating. Here we will learnsome new ideas with strange-sounding words such as“recovery factor” and “Reynolds analogy.” We willbe able to see some of the basic physics of viscousﬂow, stripped of the extra geometrical complexitiesthat go along with more complex ﬂow applications.Although this chapter involves a peculiar-soundingﬂow, Couette ﬂow, the results are far from peculiar. Indeed, in this chapter we are going to take a walkthrough some of the most important ideas surround-ing the basic analyses of viscous ﬂow. Get going, andenjoy your walk. 16.1 INTRODUCTION The general equations of viscous ﬂow were derived and discussed in Chapter 15. In particular, the viscous ﬂow momentum equations were treated in Section 15.4 andare given in partial differential equation form by Equations (15.19 atoc)—the Navier-Stokes equations. These, along with the viscous ﬂow energy equation, 959960 PART 4Viscous Flow Figure 16.1 Road map for Chapter 16. Equation (15.26), derived in Section 15.5, are the theoretical tools for the study of viscous ﬂows. However, examine these equations closely; as discussed in Sec-tion 15.7, they are a system of coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations—equations which contain more terms and which are inherently more elaborate thanthe inviscid ﬂow equations treated in Parts 2 and 3 of this book. Three classesof solutions of these equations were itemized in Section 15.5. The ﬁrst itemizedclass was that of “exact” solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations for a few spe-ciﬁc physical problems which, by their physical and geometrical nature, allowmany terms in the governing equations to be precisely zero, resulting in a systemof equations simple enough to solve, either analytically or by simple numericalmethods. Such exact problems are the subject of this chapter. The road map for this chapter is given in Figure 16.1. The type of ﬂow considered here is generally labeled as parallel ﬂow because the streamlines are straight and parallel to each other. We will consider one of these ﬂows,Couette ﬂow, which will be deﬁned in due course. In addition to representingexact solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, this ﬂow illustrates some of theimportant practical facets of any viscous ﬂow, as itemized on the right side ofthe road map. In a clear, uncomplicated fashion, we will be able to calculateand study the surface skin friction and heat transfer. We will also use the re-sults to deﬁne the recovery factor and Reynolds analogy—two practical engi-neering tools that are frequently used in the analysis of skin friction and heattransfer. 16.2 COUETTE FLOW: GENERAL DISCUSSION Consider the ﬂow model shown in Figure 16.2. Here we see a viscous ﬂuidcontained between two parallel plates separated by a distance D. The upper plate is moving to the right at velocity u e. Due to the no-slip condition, there can be no relative motion between the plate and the ﬂuid; hence, at y=Dthe ﬂow velocity is u=ueand is directed toward the right. Similarly, the ﬂow velocity atCHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 961 (a) General picture (b) Detailed modelFixed surfaceParallel streamlinesMoving plateMoving plate D At y /H11005 D : u /H11005 ue, T /H11005 Tey /H11005 D At y /H11005 0 : u /H11005 0, T /H11005 TwyD x y /H11005 0qwqeue ue /H9270e on fluid /H9270w on fluid/H11009 /H11009/H11009/H11009 /H9270 w on surface/H9270e on plate Figure 16.2 Model for Couette ﬂow. y=0, which is the surface of the stationary lower plate, is u=0. In addition, the two plates may be at different temperatures; the upper plate is at temperature Te and the lower plate is at temperature Tw. Again, due to the no-slip condition as discussed in Section 15.7, the ﬂuid temperature at y=DisT=Teand that at y=0 isT=Tw. Clearly, there is a ﬂow ﬁeld between the two plates; the driving force for this ﬂow is the motion of the upper plate, dragging the ﬂow along with it through the mechanism of friction. The upper plate is exerting a shear stress, τe, acting toward the right on the ﬂuid at y=D, thus causing the ﬂuid to move toward the right. By an equal and opposite reaction, the ﬂuid is exerting a shear stress τeon the upper plate acting toward the left, tending to retard its motion. We assume that theupper plate is being driven by some external force that is sufﬁcient to overcomethe retarding shear stress and to allow the plate to move at the constant velocity u e. Similarly, the lower plate is exerting a shear stress τwacting toward the left on the ﬂuid at y=0. By an equal and opposite reaction, the ﬂuid is exerting a shear stressτwacting toward the right on the lower plate. (In all subsequent diagrams dealing with viscous ﬂow, the only shear stresses shown will be those due to theﬂuid acting on the surface, unless otherwise noted.) In addition to the velocity ﬁeld induced by the relative motion of the two plates, there will also be a temperature ﬁeld induced by the following two962 PART 4Viscous Flow mechanisms: 1.The plates in general will be at different temperatures, thus causing temperature gradients in the ﬂow. 2.The kinetic energy of the ﬂow will be partially dissipated by the inﬂuenceof friction and will be transformed into internal energy within the ﬂuid.These changes in internal energy will be reﬂected by changes intemperature. This phenomenon is called viscous dissipation. Consequently, temperature gradients will exist within the ﬂow; in turn, thesetemperature gradients result in the transfer of heat through the ﬂuid. Of particularinterest is the heat transfer at the upper and lower surfaces, denoted by ˙q eand ˙qw, respectively. These heat transfers are shown in Figure 16.2; the directions for ˙qeand˙qwshow heat being transferred from the ﬂuid to the wall in both cases. When heat ﬂows from the ﬂuid to the wall, this is called a cold wall case, such as sketched in Figure 16.2. When heat ﬂows from the wall into the ﬂuid, this iscalled a hot wall case. Keep in mind that the heat ﬂux through the ﬂuid at any point is given by the Fourier law expressed by Equation (15.2); that is, the heatﬂux in the ydirection is expressed as ˙q y=−k∂T ∂y(15.2) where the minus sign accounts for the fact that heat is transferred from a regionof high temperature to a region of lower temperature; that is, ˙q yis in the opposite direction of the temperature gradient. Let us examine the geometry of Couette ﬂow as illustrated in Figure 16.2. An x-ycartesian coordinate system is oriented with the xaxis in the direction of the ﬂow and the yaxis perpendicular to the ﬂow. Since the two plates are parallel, the only possible ﬂow pattern consistent with this picture is that of straight, parallelstreamlines. Moreover, since the plates are inﬁnitely long (i.e., stretching to plusand minus inﬁnity in the xdirection), then the ﬂow properties cannot change with x. (If the properties did change with x, then the ﬂow-ﬁeld properties would become inﬁnitely large or inﬁnitesimally small at large values of x—a physical inconsistency.) Thus, all partial derivatives with respect to xare zero. The only changes in the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables take place in the ydirection. Moreover, the ﬂow is steady, so that all time derivatives are zero. With this geometry in mind,return to the governing Navier-Stokes equations given by Equations (15.19 atoc) and Equation (15.26). In these equations, for Couette ﬂow, v=w=0∂u ∂x=∂T ∂x=∂p ∂x=0 Hence, from Equations (15.19 atoc) and Equation (15.26), we have x-momentum equation:∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μ∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg =0 (16.1) y-momentum equation:∂p ∂y=0 (16.2)CHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 963 Energy equation:∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μu∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg =0 (16.3) Equations (16.1) to (16.3) are the governing equations for Couette ﬂow. Note that these equations are exact forms of the Navier-Stokes equations applied to thegeometry of Couette ﬂow—no approximations have been made. Also, note fromEquation (16.2) that the variation of pressure in the ydirection is zero; this in combination with the earlier result that ∂p/∂x=0 implies that the pressure is constant throughout the entire ﬂow ﬁeld. Couette ﬂow is a constant pressure ﬂow. It is interesting to note that all the previous ﬂow problems discussed in Parts 2and 3, being inviscid ﬂows, were established and maintained by the existence ofpressure gradients in the ﬂow. In these problems, the pressure gradient was nature’s mechanism of grabbing hold of the ﬂow and making it move. However,in the problem we are discussing now—being a viscous ﬂow—shear stress isanother mechanism by which nature can exert a force on a ﬂow. For Couette ﬂow,the shear stress exerted by the moving plate on the ﬂuid is the exclusive drivingmechanism that maintains the ﬂow; clearly, no pressure gradient is present, noris it needed. This section has presented the general nature of Couette ﬂow. Note that we have made no distinction between incompressible and compressible ﬂow; allaspects discussed here apply to both cases. Also, we note that, although Couetteﬂow appears to be a rather academic problem, the following sections illustrate, ina simple fashion, many of the important characteristics of practical viscous ﬂowsin real engineering applications. The next two sections will treat the separate cases of incompressible and compressible Couette ﬂow. Incompressible ﬂow will be discussed ﬁrst becauseof its relative simplicity; this is the subject of Section 16.3. Then compressibleCouette ﬂow, and how it differs from the incompressible case, will be examinedin Section 16.4. As a ﬁnal note in this section, it is obvious from our general discussion of Couette ﬂow that the ﬂow-ﬁeld properties vary only in the ydirection; all derivatives in the xdirection are zero. Therefore, as a matter of mathematical preciseness, all the partial derivatives in Equations (16.1) to (16.3) can be writtenas ordinary derivatives. For example, Equation (16.1) can be written as d dy/parenleftbigg μdu dy/parenrightbigg =0 However, our discussion of Couette ﬂow is intended to serve as a straightforwardexample of a viscous ﬂow problem, “breaking the ice” so-to-speak for the morepractical but more complex problems to come—problems which involve changesin both the xandydirections, and which are described by partial differential equations. Therefore, on pedagogical grounds, we choose to continue the partialdifferential notation here, simply to make the reader feel more comfortable whenwe extend these concepts to the boundary layer and full Navier-Stokes solutionsin Chapters 17 and 20, respectively.964 PART 4Viscous Flow 16.3 INCOMPRESSIBLE (CONSTANT PROPERTY) COUETTE FLOW In the study of viscous ﬂows, a ﬂow ﬁeld in which ρ,μ, and kare treated as constants is sometimes labeled as “constant property” ﬂow. This assumption is made in the present section. On a physical basis, this means that we are dealingwith an incompressible ﬂow, where ρis constant. Also, since μandkare functions of temperature (see Section 15.3), constant property ﬂow implies that Tis constant also. (We will relax this assumption slightly at the end of this section.) The governing equations for Couette ﬂow were derived in Section 16.2. In particular, the y-momentum equation, Equation (16.2), along with the geometrical property that ∂p/∂x=0, states that the pressure is constant throughout the ﬂow. Consequently, all the information about the velocity ﬁeld comes from the x-momentum equation, Equation (16.1), repeated below: ∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μ∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg =0 (16.1) For constant μ, this becomes ∂2u ∂y2=0 (16.4) Integrating with respect to ytwice, we obtain u=ay+b (16.5) where aandbare constants of integration. These constants can be obtained from the boundary conditions illustrated in Figure 16.2, as follows: Aty=0,u=0; hence, b=0. Aty=D,u=ue; hence, a=ue/D. Thus, the variation of velocity for incompressible Couette ﬂow is given by Equa-tion (16.5) as u=ue/parenleftbiggy D/parenrightbigg (16.6) Note the important result that the velocity varies linearly across the ﬂow. This result is sketched in Figure 16.3. Once the velocity proﬁle is obtained, we can obtain the shear stress at any point in the ﬂow from Equation (15.1), repeated below (the subscript yxis dropped here because we know the only shear stress acting in this problem is that in the xdirection): τ=μ∂u ∂y(16.7) From Equation (16.6), ∂u ∂y=ue D(16.8)CHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 965 Due Figure 16.3 Velocity proﬁle for incompressible Couette ﬂow. Hence, from Equations (16.7) and (16.8), we have τ=μ/parenleftbiggue D/parenrightbigg (16.9) Note that the shear stress is constant throughout the ﬂow. Moreover, the straight- forward result given by Equation (16.9) illustrates two important physical trends— trends that we will ﬁnd to be almost universally present in all viscous ﬂows: 1.Asueincreases, the shear stress increases. From Equation (16.9), τincreases linearly with ue; this is a speciﬁc result germane to Couette ﬂow. For other problems, the increase is not necessarily linear. 2.AsDincreases, the shear stress decreases; that is, as the thickness of the viscous shear layer increases, all other things being equal, the shear stress becomes smaller. From Equation (16.9), τis inversely proportional to D—again a result germane to Couette ﬂow. For other problems, the decrease in τis not necessarily in direct inverse proportion to the shear-layer thickness. With the above results in mind, reﬂect for a moment on the quotation from Isaac Newton’s Principia given at the beginning of this chapter. Here, the “want of lubricity” is, in modern terms, interpreted as the shear stress. This want of lubricity is, according to Newton, “proportional to the velocity with which theparts of the ﬂuid are separated from one another,” that is, in the context of thepresent problem proportional to u e/D. This is precisely the statement contained in Equation (16.9). In more recent times, Newton’s statement is generalized to theform given by Equation (16.7), and even more generalized by Equation (15.1).For this reason, Equations (15.1) and (16.7) are frequently called the newtonianshear stress law, and ﬂuids which obey this law are called newtonian ﬂuids. [There966 PART 4Viscous Flow are some specialized ﬂuids which do not obey Equation (15.1) or (16.7); they are called non-newtonian ﬂuids—some polymers and blood are two such examples.]By far, the vast majority of aeronautical applications deal with air or other gases,which are newtonian ﬂuids. In hydrodynamics, water is the primary medium, andit is a newtonian ﬂuid. Therefore, we will deal exclusively with newtonian ﬂuidsin this book. Consequently, the quote given at the beginning of this chapter is oneof Newton’s most important contributions to ﬂuid mechanics—it represents theﬁrst time in history where shear stress is recognized as being proportional to avelocity gradient. Let us now turn our attention to heat transfer in a Couette ﬂow. Here, we continue our assumptions of constant ρ,μ, and k, but at the same time, we will allow a temperature gradient to exist in the ﬂow. In an exact sense, this isinconsistent; if Tvaries throughout the ﬂow, then ρ,μ, and kalso vary. However, for this application, we assume that the temperature variations are small—indeed,small enough such that ρ,μ, and kareapproximately constant—and treat them so in the equations. On the other hand, the temperature changes, although small onan absolute basis, are sufﬁcient to result in meaningful heat ﬂux through the ﬂuid.The results obtained will reﬂect some of the important trends in aerodynamicheating associated with high-speed ﬂows, to be discussed in subsequent chapters. For Couette ﬂow with heat transfer, return to Figure 16.2. Here, the temper- ature of the upper plate is T eand that of the lower plate is Tw. Hence, we have as boundary conditions for the temperature of the ﬂuid: At y=0: T=Tw At y=D: T=Te The temperature proﬁle in the ﬂow is governed by the energy equation, Equa- tion (16.3). For constant μandk, this equation is written as k μ/parenleftbigg∂2T ∂y2/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg u∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg =0 (16.10) Also, since μis assumed to be constant, Equations (16.10) and (16.1) are totally uncoupled. That is, for the constant property ﬂow considered here, the solution ofthe momentum equation [Equation (16.1)] is totally separate from the solution ofthe energy equation [Equation (16.10)]. Therefore, in this problem, although thetemperature is allowed to vary, the velocity ﬁeld is still given by Equation (16.6),as sketched in Figure 16.3. In dealing with ﬂows where energy concepts are important, the enthalpy h is frequently a more fundamental variable than temperature; we have seen muchevidence of this in Part 3, where energy changes were a vital consideration. In thepresent problem, where the temperature changes are small enough to justify theassumptions of constant ρ,μ, and k, this is not quite the same situation. However, because we will need to solve Equation (16.10), which is an energy equationfor a ﬂow (no matter how small the energy changes), and because we are usingCouette ﬂow as an example to set the stage for more complex problems, it isCHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 967 instructional (but by no means necessary) to couch Equation (16.10) in terms of enthalpy. Assuming constant speciﬁc heat, we have h=cpT (16.11) Equation (16.11) is valid for the Couette ﬂow of any ﬂuid with constant heatcapacity; here, the germane speciﬁc heat is that at constant pressure c pbecause the entire ﬂow ﬁeld is at constant pressure. In this sense, Equation (16.11) is aresult of applying the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics to a constant pressure processand recalling the fundamental deﬁnition of heat capacity as the heat added perunit change in temperature, δq/dT. Of course, if the ﬂuid is a calorically perfect gas, then Equation (16.11) is a basic thermodynamic property of such a gas quiteindependent of what the process may be [see Section 7.2 and Equation (7.6b )]. Inserting Equation (16.11) into Equation (16.10), we have k μcp∂2h ∂y2+∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg u∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg =0 (16.12) Recall the deﬁnition of the Prandtl number from Section 15.6, namely, Pr=μcp k Equation (16.12) can be written in terms of the Prandtl number as 1 Pr∂2h ∂y2+∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg u∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg =0 or∂2h ∂y2+Pr 2∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg∂u2 ∂y/parenrightbigg =0 (16.13) Integrating twice in the ydirection, we ﬁnd that Equation (16.13) yields h+/parenleftbiggPr 2/parenrightbigg u2=ay+b (16.14) where aandbare constants of integration [different from the aandbin Equa- tion (16.5)]. Expressions for aandbare found by applying Equation (16.14) at the boundaries, as follows: At y=0: h=hwand u=0 At y=D: h=heand u=ue Hence, from Equation (16.14) at the boundaries, b=hw and a=he−hw+(Pr/2)u2 e D Inserting these values into Equation (16.14) and rearranging, we have h=hw+/bracketleftbigg he−hw+/parenleftbiggPr 2/parenrightbigg u2 e/bracketrightbiggy D−/parenleftbiggPr 2/parenrightbigg u2(16.15)968 PART 4Viscous Flow Inserting Equation (16.6) for the velocity proﬁle in Equation (16.15) yields h=hw+/bracketleftbigg he−hw+/parenleftbiggPr 2/parenrightbigg u2 e/bracketrightbiggy D−/parenleftbiggPr 2/parenrightbigg u2e/parenleftbiggy D/parenrightbigg2 (16.16) Note that hvaries parabolically with y/Dacross the ﬂow. Since T=h/cp, then the temperature proﬁle across the ﬂow is also parabolic. The precise shape of the parabolic curve depends on hw(orTw),he(orTe), and Pr. Also note that, as expected from our discussion of the viscous ﬂow similarity parametersin Section 15.6, the Prandtl number is clearly a strong player in the results;Equation (16.16) is one such example. Once the enthalpy (or temperature) proﬁle is obtained, we can obtain the heat ﬂux at any point in the ﬂow from Equation (15.2), repeated below (the subscript yis dropped here because we know the only direction of heat transfer is in the ydirection for this problem): ˙q=−k∂T ∂y(16.17) Equation (16.17) can be written as ˙q=−k cp∂h ∂y(16.18) In Equation (16.18), the enthalpy gradient is obtained by differentiating Equa-tion (16.16) as follows: ∂h ∂y=/bracketleftbigg he−hw+/parenleftbiggPr 2/parenrightbigg u2 e/bracketrightbigg1 D−Pru2ey D2(16.19) Inserting Equation (16.19) into Equation (16.18), and writing k/cpasμ/Pr, we have ˙q=−μ/parenleftbigghe−hw Pr+u2 e 2/parenrightbigg1 D+μu2 ey D2(16.20) From Equation (16.20), note that ˙qisnotconstant across the ﬂow, unlike the shear stress discussed earlier. Rather, ˙qvaries linearly with y. The physical reason for the variation of ˙qisviscous dissipation which takes place within the ﬂow, and which is associated with the shear stress in the ﬂow. Indeed, the last term in Equation (16.20), in light of Equations (16.6) and (16.9), can be written as μu2 ey D2=τue/parenleftbiggy D/parenrightbigg =τu Hence, Equation (16.20) becomes ˙q=−μ/parenleftbigghe−hw Pr+u2 e 2/parenrightbigg1 D+τu (16.21) The variation of ˙qacross the ﬂow is due to the last term in Equation (16.21), and this term involves shear stress multiplied by velocity. The term τuisviscousCHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 969 dissipation; it is the time rate of heat generated at a point in the ﬂow by one streamline at a given velocity “rubbing” against an adjacent streamline at a slightly different velocity—analogous to the heat you feel when rubbing your hands to-gether vigorously. Note that, if u eis negligibly small, then the viscous dissipation is small and can be neglected; that is, in Equation (16.20) the last term can beneglected (u eis small), and in Equation (16.21) the last term can be neglected (τis small if ueis small). In this case, the heat ﬂux becomes constant across the ﬂow, simply equal to ˙q≈−μ Pr/parenleftbigghe−hw D/parenrightbigg (16.22) In this case, the “driving potential” for heat transfer across the ﬂow is simplythe enthalpy difference (h e−hw)or, in other words, the temperature difference (Te−Tw)across the ﬂow. However, as we have emphasized, if ueis not negligible, then viscous dissipation becomes another factor that drives the heat transfer acrossthe ﬂow. Of particular practical interest is the heat ﬂux at the walls—the aerodynamic heating as we label it here. We denote the heat transfer at a wall as ˙q w. Moreover, it is conventional to quote aerodynamic heating at a wall without any sign con-vention. For example, if the heat transfer from the ﬂuid to the wall is 10 W/cm 2, or, if in reverse the heat transfer from the wall to the ﬂuid is 10 W/cm2, it is simply quoted as such; in both cases, ˙qwis given as 10 W/cm2without any sign convention. In this sense, we write Equation (16.18) as ˙qw=k cp/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle∂h ∂y/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle w=μ Pr/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle∂h ∂y/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle w(16.23) where the subscript wimplies conditions at the wall. The direction of the net heat transfer at the wall, whether it is from the ﬂuid to the wall or from the wall to the ﬂuid, is easily seen from the temperature gradient at the wall; if the wall is coolerthan the adjacent ﬂuid, heat is transferred into the wall, and if the wall is hotterthan the adjacent ﬂuid, heat is transferred into the ﬂuid. Another criterion is tocompare the wall temperature with the adiabatic wall temperature, to be deﬁnedshortly. Return to the picture of Couette ﬂow in Figure 16.2. To calculate the heat transfer at the lower wall, use Equation (16.23) with the enthalpy gradient givenby Equation (16.19) evaluated at y=0: At y=0: ˙qw=μ Pr/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglehe−hw+1 2Pru2 e D/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle (16.24) To calculate the heat transfer at the upper wall, use Equation (16.23) with the enthalpy gradient given by Equation (16.19) evaluated at y=D. In this case,970 PART 4Viscous Flow Equation (16.19) yields ∂h ∂y=he−hw+1 2Pru2 e D−Pru2e D=he−hw−1 2Pru2e D In turn, from Equation (16.23) At y=D:˙qw=μ Pr/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglehe−hw−1 2Pru2 e D/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle (16.25) Let us examine the above results for three different scenarios, namely, (1) neg- ligible viscous dissipation, (2)equal wall temperature, and (3) adiabatic wall conditions (no heat transfer to the wall). In the process, we deﬁne three important concepts in the analysis of aerodynamic heating: (1) adiabatic wall temperature, (2)recovery factor, and (3) Reynolds analogy. 16.3.1 Negligible Viscous Dissipation To some extent, we have already discussed this case in regard to the local heat ﬂux at any point within the ﬂow. If ueis very small, hence τis very small, then the amount of viscous dissipation is negligibly small, and Equation (16.21) becomes ˙q=−μ Pr/parenleftbigghe−hw D/parenrightbigg (16.26) Clearly, for this case, the heat ﬂux is constant across the ﬂow. Moreover, theenthalpy proﬁle given by Equation (16.16) becomes h=h w+(he−hw)y D(16.27) Since h=cpT, the temperature proﬁle is identical to the enthalpy proﬁle: T=Tw+(Te−Tw)y D(16.28) Note that the temperature varies linearly across the ﬂow, as sketched in Fig- ure 16.4. The case shown here is for the upper wall at a higher temperature than the Dy y Due Te TwT /H11005 Tw /H11001 (Te /H11002 Tw) Figure 16.4 Couette ﬂow temperature proﬁle for negligible viscous dissipation.CHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 971 lower wall. The heat transfer at the lower wall is obtained from Equation (16.24) with a negligible ue: At y=0: ˙qw=μ Pr/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglehe−hw D/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle (16.29) The heat transfer at the upper wall is similarly obtained as At y=D: ˙qw=μ Pr/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglehe−hw D/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle (16.30) Equations (16.29) and (16.30) are identical; this is no surprise, since we have already shown that the heat ﬂux is constant across the ﬂow, as shown by Equa-tion (16.26), and therefore the heat transfer at both walls should be the same.Equations (16.29) and (16.30) can also be written in terms of temperature as ˙q w=k/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleTe−Tw D/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle (16.31) Examining Equations (16.29) to (16.31), we can make some conclusions which can be generalized to most viscous ﬂow problems, as follows: 1.Everything else being equal, the larger the temperature difference across the viscous layer, the greater the heat transfer at the wall. The temperaturedifference (T e−Tw)or the enthalpy difference (he−hw)takes on the role of a “driving potential” for heat transfer. For the special case treated here,the heat transfer at the wall is directly proportional to this driving potential. 2.Everything else being equal, the thicker the viscous layer (the larger Dis), the smaller the heat transfer is at the wall. For the special case treated here, ˙q wis inversely proportional to D. 3.Heat ﬂows from a region of high temperature to low temperature. Fornegligible viscous dissipation, if the temperature at the top of the viscouslayer is higher than that at the bottom, heat ﬂows from the top to the bottom.In the case sketched in Figure 16.4, heat is transferred from the upper plateinto the ﬂuid, and then is transferred from the ﬂuid to the lower plate. 16.3.2 Equal Wall Temperatures Here we assume that Te=Tw; that is, he=hw.

Note that the temperature varies parabolically with y, as sketched in Figure 16.5. The maximum value of temperature occurs at the midpoint, y=D/2. This maximum value is obtained by evaluating Equation (16.33) at y=D/2. Tmax=Tw+Pru2 e 8cp(16.34) The heat transfer at the walls is obtained from Equations (16.24) and (16.25) as At y=0: ˙qw=μ 2u2 e D(16.35) At y=D:˙qw=μ 2u2e D(16.36) Equations (16.35) and (16.36) are identical; the heat transfers at the upper and lower walls are equal. In this case, as can be seen by inspecting the temperaturedistribution shown in Figure 16.5, the upper and lower walls are both cooler thanthe adjacent ﬂuid. Hence, at both the upper and lower walls, heat is transferredfrom the ﬂuid to the wall. Question: Since the walls are at equal temperature, where is the heat transfer coming from? Answer: Viscous dissipation. The local temperature increase in the ﬂow as sketched in Figure 16.5 is due solely to viscous dissipation within the ﬂuid. In turn, both walls experience an aerodynamic heating effect due to this viscousdissipation. This is clearly evident in Equations (16.35) and (16.36), where ˙q w depends on the velocity ue. Indeed, ˙qwis directly proportional to the square of ue. In light of Equation (16.9), Equations (16.35) and (16.36) can be written as ˙qw=τ/parenleftbiggue 2/parenrightbigg (16.37) which further emphasizes that ˙qwis due entirely to the action of shear stress in the ﬂow. From Equations (16.35) to (16.37), we can make the following conclusionsthat reﬂect general properties of most viscous ﬂows: 1.Everything else being equal, aerodynamic heating increases as the ﬂow velocity increases. This is why aerodynamic heating becomes an importantCHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 973 design factor in high-speed aerodynamics. Indeed, for most hypersonic vehicles, you can begin to appreciate that viscous dissipation generatesextreme temperatures within the boundary layer adjacent to the vehiclesurface and frequently makes aerodynamic heating the dominant designfactor. In the Couette ﬂow case shown here—a far cry from hypersonicﬂow—we see that ˙q wvaries directly as u2 e. 2.Everything else being equal, aerodynamic heating decreases as the thickness of the viscous layer increases. For the case considered here, ˙qwis inversely proportional to D. This conclusion is the same as that made for the above case of negligible viscous dissipation but with unequal wall temperature. 16.3.3 Adiabatic Wall Conditions (Adiabatic Wall Temperature) Let us imagine the following situation. Assume that the ﬂow illustrated in Fig-ure 16.5 is established. We have the parabolic temperature proﬁle established asshown, and we have heat transfer into the walls as just discussed. However, bothwall temperatures are considered ﬁxed, and both are equal to the same constant value. Question: How can the wall temperature remain ﬁxed at the same time that heat is transferred into the wall? Answer: There must be some independent mechanism that conducts heat away from the wall at the same rate that the aero-dynamic heating is pumping heat into the wall. This is the only way for the walltemperature to remain ﬁxed at some cooler temperature than the adjacent ﬂuid.For example, the wall can be some vast heat sink that can absorb heat without anyappreciable change in temperature, or possibly there are cooling coils within theplate that can carry away the heat, much like the water coils that keep the engine ofyour automobile cool. In any event, to have the picture shown in Figure 16.5 witha constant wall temperature independent of time, some exterior mechanism mustcarry away the heat that is transferred from the ﬂuid to the walls. Now imaginethat, at the lower wall, this exterior mechanism is suddenly shut off. The lowerwall will now begin to grow hotter in response to ˙q w, and Twwill begin to increase with time. At any given instant during this transient process, the heat transfer tothe lower wall is given by Equation (16.24), repeated below: ˙q w=μ Pr/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglehe−hw+1 2Pru2 e D/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle (16.24) At time t=0, when the exterior cooling mechanism is just shut off, hw=he, and˙qwis given by Equation (16.35), namely, At time t =0: ˙qw=μ 2u2 e D However, as time now progresses, Tw(and therefore hw) increases. From Equa- tion (16.24), as hwincreases, the numerator decreases in magnitude, and hence ˙qwdecreases. That is, At t>0: ˙qw<μ 2u2e D974 PART 4Viscous Flow Figure 16.6 Illustration for the deﬁnition of an adiabatic wall and the adiabatic wall temperature. Hence, as time progresses from when the exterior cooling mechanism was ﬁrst cut off at the lower wall, the wall temperature increases, and the aerodynamicheating to the wall decreases. This in turn slows the rate of increase of T was time progresses. The transient variations of both ˙qwandTware sketched in Figure 16.6. In Figure 16.6a, we see that, as time increases to large values, the heat transferto the wall approaches zero—this is deﬁned as the equilibrium, or the adiabatic wall condition. For an adiabatic wall, the heat transfer is, by deﬁnition, equal to zero. Simultaneously, the wall temperature T wapproaches asymptotically a lim- iting value deﬁned as the adiabatic wall temperature T aw, and the corresponding enthalpy is deﬁned as the adiabatic wall enthalpy h aw. The purpose of this discussion is to deﬁne an adiabatic wall condition; the example involving a timewise approach to this condition was just for convenienceand ediﬁcation. Let us now assume that the lower wall in our Couette ﬂow is anadiabatic wall. For this case, we already know the value of heat transfer to thewall—by deﬁnition, it is zero. The question now becomes, What is the value ofthe adiabatic wall enthalpy h aw, and in turn the adiabatic wall temperature Taw? The answer is given by Equation (16.23), where ˙qw=0 for an adiabatic wall. Adiabatic wall: ˙qw=0→/parenleftbigg∂h ∂y/parenrightbigg w=/parenleftbigg∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg w=0 (16.38) Therefore, from Equation (16.19), with ∂h/∂y=0,y=0, and hw=haw, by deﬁnition he−haw+1 2Pru2 e=0 or haw=he+Pru2 e 2(16.39)CHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 975 Dy ueTe TawT /H11005 Taw /H110022cpPru2e2 Dy Figure 16.7 Couette ﬂow temperature proﬁle for an adiabatic lower wall. In turn, the adiabatic wall temperature is given by Taw=Te+Pru2 e 2cp(16.40) Clearly, the higher the value of ue, the higher is the adiabatic wall temperature. The enthalpy proﬁle across the ﬂow for this case is given by a combination of Equations (16.16) and (16.40), as follows. Setting hw=hawin Equation (16.16), we obtain h=haw+/parenleftbigg he+haw+Pru2e 2/parenrightbiggy D−Pr 2u2 e/parenleftbiggy D/parenrightbigg2 (16.41) From Equation (16.39), he−haw=− Pru2 e 2(16.42) Inserting Equation (16.42) into (16.41), we have h=haw−Pru2e 2/parenleftbiggy D/parenrightbigg2 (16.43) Equation (16.43) gives the enthalpy proﬁle across the ﬂow. The temperature proﬁle follows from Equation (16.43) as T=Taw−Pru2 e 2cp/parenleftbiggy D/parenrightbigg2 (16.44) This variation of Tis sketched in Figure 16.7. Note that Tawis the maximum temperature in the ﬂow. Moreover, the temperature curve is perpendicular at the plate for y=0; that is, the temperature gradient at the lower plate is zero, as expected for an adiabatic wall. This result is also obtained by differentiatingEquation (16.44): ∂T ∂y=− Pru2 e cpD/parenleftbiggy D/parenrightbigg which gives ∂T/∂y=0 aty=0.976 PART 4Viscous Flow 16.3.4 Recovery Factor As a corollary to the above case for the adiabatic wall, we take this opportunity to deﬁne the recovery factor—a useful engineering parameter in the analysis ofaerodynamic heating. The total enthalpy of the ﬂow at the upper plate (whichrepresents the upper boundary on a viscous shear layer) is, by deﬁnition, h 0=he+u2 e 2(16.45) (The signiﬁcance and deﬁnition of total enthalpy are discussed in Section 7.5.) Compare Equation (16.45), which is a general deﬁnition, with Equation (16.39),repeated below, which is for the special case of Couette ﬂow: h aw=he+Pru2 e 2(16.39) Note that hawis different from h0, the difference provided by the value of Pr as it appears in Equation (16.39). We now generalize Equation (16.39) to a form which holds for any viscous ﬂow, as follows: haw=he+ru2e 2(16.46a) Similarly, Equation (16.40) can be generalized to Taw=Te+ru2e 2cp(16.46b) In Equations (16.46 aandb),ris deﬁned as the recovery factor. It is the factor that tells us how close the adiabatic wall enthalpy is to the total enthalpy at the upper boundary of the viscous ﬂow. If r=1, then haw=h0. An alternate expression for the recovery factor can be obtained by combining Equations (16.46) and (16.45)as follows. From Equation (16.46), r=h aw−he u2 e/2(16.47) From Equation (16.45), u2 e 2=h0−he (16.48) Inserting Equation (16.48) into (16.47), we have r=haw−he h0−he=Taw−Te T0−Te(16.49) where T0is the total temperature. Equation (16.49) is frequently used as an alter- nate deﬁnition of the recovery factor.CHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 977 In the special case of Couette ﬂow, by comparing Equation (16.39) or (16.40) with Equation (16.46 a) or (16.46b ), we ﬁnd that r=Pr (16.50) For Couette ﬂow, the recovery factor is simply the Prandtl number. Note that, if Pr<1, then haw<h0; conversely, if Pr >1, then haw>h0. In more general viscous ﬂow cases, the recovery factor is not simply the Prandtl number; however, in general, for incompressible viscous ﬂows, we willﬁnd that the recovery factor is some function of Pr. Hence, the Prandtl number is playing its role as an important viscous ﬂow parameter. As expected fromSection 15.6, for a compressible viscous ﬂow, the recovery factor is a function ofPr along with the Mach number and the ratio of speciﬁc heats. 16.3.5 Reynolds Analogy Another useful engineering relation for the analysis of aerodynamic heating isReynolds analogy, which can easily be introduced within the context of our dis-cussion of Couette ﬂow. Reynolds analogy is a relation between the skin frictioncoefﬁcient and the heat transfer coefﬁcient. The skin friction coefﬁcient c fwas ﬁrst introduced in Section 1.5. In our context here, we deﬁne the skin frictioncoefﬁcient as c f=τw 1 2ρeu2 e(16.51) From Equation (16.9), we have, for Couette ﬂow, τw=μ/parenleftbiggue D/parenrightbigg (16.52) Combining Equations (16.51) and (16.52), we have cf=μ(ue/D) 1 2ρeu2e=2μ ρeueD(16.53) Let us deﬁne the Reynolds number for Couette ﬂow as Re=ρeueD μ Then, Equation (16.53) becomes cf=2 Re(16.54) Equation (16.54) is interesting in its own right. It demonstrates that the skin friction coefﬁcient is a function of just the Reynolds number—a result whichapplies in general for other incompressible viscous ﬂows [although the functionis not necessarily the same as given in Equation (16.54)].978 PART 4Viscous Flow Now let us deﬁne a heat transfer coefﬁcient as CH=˙qw ρeue(haw−hw)(16.55) In Equation (16.55), CHis called the Stanton number; it is one of several different types of heat transfer coefﬁcient that is used in the analysis of aerodynamic heat- ing. It is a dimensionless quantity, in the same vein as the skin-friction coefﬁcient.For Couette ﬂow, from Equation (16.24), and dropping the absolute value signsfor convenience, we have ˙q w=μ Pr/parenleftBigg he−hw+1 2Pru2 e D/parenrightBigg (16.56) Inserting Equation (16.39) into (16.56), we have for Couette ﬂow ˙qw=μ Pr/parenleftbigghaw−hw D/parenrightbigg (16.57) Inserting Equation (16.57) into (16.55), we obtain CH=(μ/Pr)[( haw−hw)/D] ρeue(haw−hw)=μ/Pr ρeueD=1 Re Pr(16.58) Equation (16.58) is interesting in its own right. It demonstrates that the Stanton number is a function of the Reynolds number and Prandtl number—a result thatapplies generally for other incompressible viscous ﬂows [although the functionis not necessarily the same as given in Equation (16.58)]. We now combine the results for c fandCHobtained above. From Equa- tions (16.54) and (16.58), we have CH cf=/parenleftbigg1 Re Pr/parenrightbiggRe 2 orCH cf=1 2Pr−1(16.59) Equation (16.59) is Reynolds analogy as applied to Couette ﬂow. Reynolds anal-ogy is, in general, a relation between the heat transfer coefﬁcient and the skinfriction coefﬁcient. For Couette ﬂow, this relation is given by Equation (16.59).Note that the ratio C H/cfis simply a function of the Prandtl number—a result that applies usually for other incompressible viscous ﬂows, although not necessarilythe same function as given in Equation (16.59). 16.3.6 Interim Summary In this section, we have studied incompressible Couette ﬂow. Although it is asomewhat academic ﬂow, it has all the trappings of many practical viscous ﬂowproblems, with the added advantage of lending itself to a simple, straightfor-ward solution. We have taken this advantage, and have discussed incompressibleCHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 979 Couette ﬂow in great detail. Our major purpose in this discussion is to make the reader familiar with many concepts used in general in the analysis of viscousﬂows without clouding the picture with more ﬂuid dynamic complexities. In thecontext of our study of Couette ﬂow, we have one additional question to address,namely, What is the effect of compressibility? This question is addressed in thenext section. EXAMPLE 16.1 Consider the geometry sketched in Figure 16.2. The velocity of the upper plate is 200 ft/s, and the two plates are separated by a distance of 0.01 in. The ﬂuid between the plates isair. Assume incompressible ﬂow. The temperature of both plates is the standard sea levelvalue of 519 ◦R. (a) Calculate the velocity in the middle of the ﬂow.(b) Calculate the shear stress.(c) Calculate the maximum temperature in the ﬂow.(d) Calculate the heat transfer to either wall. (e) If the lower wall is suddenly made adiabatic, calculate its temperature. ■Solution Assume that μis constant throughout the ﬂow, and that it is equal to its value of 3.7373 × 10−7slug/ft/s at the standard sea level temperature of 519◦R. (a) From Equation (16.6), u=ue/parenleftBigy D/parenrightBig u=(200)/parenleftbig1 2/parenrightbig =100 ft/s (b) From Equation (16.9), τw=μue Dwhere D=0.01 in =8.33×10−4ft τw=(3.7373 ×10−7)(200) 8.33×10−4=0.09 lb/ft2 Note that the shear stress is relatively small—less than a tenth of a pound acting over asquare foot. (c) From Equation (16.34), for equal wall temperatures, the maximum temperature, which occurs at y/D=0.5, is T=T w+Pr cpu2 e 2/bracketleftbiggy D−/parenleftBigy D/parenrightBig2/bracketrightbigg =Tw+Pru2e 8cp For air at standard conditions, Pr =0.71 and cp=6006 (ft ·lb)/(slug ·◦R). Hence, T=519+(0.71)(200)2 8(6006)=519+0.6=519.6◦R Notice that the maximum temperature in the ﬂow is only six-tenths of a degree above the wall temperature—viscous dissipation for this relatively low-speed case is very small.980 PART 4Viscous Flow This certainly justiﬁes our assumption of constant ρ,μ, and kin this section, and gives us a feeling for the energy changes associated with an essentially incompressible ﬂow—they are very small. (d) From Equation (16.35), ˙qw=μ 2/parenleftbiggu2 e D/parenrightbigg =(3.7373 ×10−7)(200)2 (2)(8.33 ×10−4)=8.97 (ft ·lb)/(ft2/s) Since there are 778 ft ·lb to a Btu (British thermal unit), then ˙qw=8.97 (ft ·lb)/(ft2/s)=0.0115 Btu/(ft2/s) (e) From Equation (16.40), Taw=Te+Pr cp/parenleftbiggu2e 2/parenrightbigg =519+(0.71)(200)2 (2)(6006) =519+2.36=521.36◦R Note in the above example that the adiabatic wall temperature is higher than the maximum ﬂow temperature calculated in part (c)for the cold wall case. In general, for cold wall cases, the viscous dissipation in the ﬂow is not sufﬁcient toheat the gas anywhere in the ﬂow to a temperature as high as the adiabatic walltemperature. Also, we again note the comparatively low temperature increase— T awis only 2.36◦higher than the upper wall temperature. In contrast, for the compressible ﬂow to be treated in the next section, the temperature increases canbe substantial—this is one of the major aspects that distinguishes compressibleviscous ﬂow from incompressible viscous ﬂow. Note that, in the present problem,the Mach number of the upper plate is M e=ue ae=ue√γRTe=200√(1.4)(1716)(519)=0.18 Again, this certainly justiﬁes our assumption of incompressible ﬂow for thisproblem. 16.4 COMPRESSIBLE COUETTE FLOW Return to Figure 16.2, which is our general model of Couette ﬂow. We nowassume that u eis large enough; hence, the changes in temperature within the ﬂow are substantial enough, so that we must treat ρ,μ, and kas variables—this is compressible Couette ﬂow. Since T=T(y), then μ=μ(y)andk=k(y). Also, since∂p/∂x=0 from the geometry and ∂p/∂y=0 from Equation (16.2), then the pressure is constant throughout the compressible Couette ﬂow, just as in theincompressible case discussed in Section 16.3. From the equation of state, wehaveρ=p/RT; because T=T(y),ρis also a function of y, varying inversely with temperature.CHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 981 The governing equations for compressible Couette ﬂow are Equations (16.1) to (16.3), with μandkas variables. Let us arrange these equations in a form convenient for solution. From Equation (16.1), ∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μ∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg =∂τ ∂y=0 (16.60) or τ=const (16.61) Hence, just as in the incompressible case, the shear stress is constant across the ﬂow. However, keep in mind that μ=μ(y), and, from τ=μ(∂u/∂y), clearly the velocity gradient, ∂u/∂y, isnotconstant across the ﬂow—this is an essential difference between compressible and incompressible ﬂows. With all this in mind,Equation (16.3), repeated below ∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μu∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg =0 (16.3) can be written as ∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg +τ∂u ∂y=0 (16.62) The temperature variation of μis accurately given by Sutherland’s law, Equa- tion (15.3), for the temperature range of interest in this book. Hence, from Equa-tion (15.3) and recalling that it is written in the International System of Units, wehave τ=μ∂u ∂y=μ0/parenleftbiggT T0/parenrightbigg3/2T0+110 T+110/parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg (16.63) The solution for compressible Couette ﬂow requires a numerical solution of Equation (16.62). Note that, with μandkas variables, Equation (16.62) is a non- linear differential equation, and for the conditions stated, it does not have a neat, closed-form, analytic solution. Recognizing the need for a numerical solution,let us write Equation (16.62) in terms of the ordinary differential equation that itreally is. (Recall that we have been using the partial differential notation only asa carry-over from the Navier-Stokes equations and to make the equations for ourstudy of Couette ﬂow look more familiar when treating the two-dimensional andthree-dimensional viscous ﬂows discussed in Chapters 17 to 20—just a pedagog-ical ploy on our part): d dy/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg +τdu dy=0 (16.64) Equation (16.64) must be solved between y=0, where T=Tw, and y=D, where T=Te. Note that the boundary conditions must be satisﬁed at two different locations in the ﬂow, namely, at y=0 and y=D; this is called a two-point boundary value problem. We present two approaches to the numerical solutionof this problem. Both approaches are used for the solutions of more complex982 PART 4Viscous Flow viscous ﬂows to be discussed in Chapters 17 through 20, and that is why they are presented here in the context of Couette ﬂow—simply to “break the ice” for oursubsequent discussions. 16.4.1 Shooting Method This method is a classic method for the solution of the boundary-layer equationsto be discussed in Chapter 17. For the solution of compressible Couette ﬂow, thesame philosophy follows as that to be applied to boundary-layer solutions, andthat is why we discuss it now. The method involves a double iteration, that is, twominor iterations nested within a major iteration. The scheme is as follows: 1.Assume a value for τin Equation (16.64). A reasonable assumption to start with is the incompressible value, τ=μ(u e/D). Also, assume that the variation of u(y)is given by the incompressible result from Equation (16.6). 2.Starting at y=0 with the known boundary condition T=Tw, integrate Equation (16.64) across the ﬂow until y=D. Use any standard numerical technique for ordinary differential equations, such as the well-known Runge-Kutta method (see, e.g., Reference 49). However, to start thisnumerical integration, because Equation (16.64) is second order, two boundary conditions must be speciﬁed at y=0. We only have one physical condition, namely, T=T w. Therefore, we have to assume a second condition; let us assume a value for the temperature gradient at the wall, thatis, assume a value for (dT/dy) w. A value based on the incompressible ﬂow solution discussed in Section 16.3 would be a reasonable assumption. Withtheassumed (dT/dy) wand the known T waty=0, then Equation (16.64) is integrated numerically away from the wall, starting at y=0 and moving in small increments, /Delta1yin the direction of increasing y. Values of Tat each increment in yare produced by the numerical algorithm. 3.Stop the numerical integration when y=Dis reached. Check to see if the numerical value of Taty=Dequals the speciﬁed boundary condition, T=Te. Most likely, it will not because we have had to assume a value for (dT/dy)win step 2. Hence, return to step 2, assume another value of (dT/dy)w, and repeat the integration. Continue to repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence is obtained, that is, until a value of (dT/dy)wis found such that, after the numerical integration, T=Teaty=D. From the converged temperature proﬁle obtained by repetition of steps 2 and 3, we now havenumerical values for Tas a function of ythat satisfy both boundary conditions; that is, T=T wat the lower wall and T=Teat the upper wall. However, do not forget that this converged solution was obtained for theassumed value of τand the assumed velocity proﬁle u(y)in step 1. Therefore, the converged proﬁle for Tis not necessarily the correct proﬁle. We must continue further; this time to ﬁnd the correct value for τ. 4.From the converged temperature proﬁle obtained by the repetitive iterationin steps 2 and 3, we can obtain μ=μ(y)from Equation (15.3).CHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 983 5.From the deﬁnition of shear stress, τ=μdu dy we havedu dy=τ μ(16.65) Recall from the solution of the momentum equation, Equation (16.60), that τis a constant. Using the assumed value of τfrom step 1, and the values of μ=μ(y)from step 4, numerically integrate Equation (16.65) starting at y=0 and using the known boundary condition u=0 aty=0. Since Equation (16.65) is ﬁrst order, this single boundary condition is sufﬁcient toinitiate the numerical integration. Values of uat each increment in y,/Delta1y, are produced by the numerical algorithm. 6.Stop the numerical integration when y=Dis reached. Check to see if the numerical value of uaty=Dequals the speciﬁed boundary condition, u=u e. Most likely, it will not, because we have had to assume a value of τ andu(y)all the way back in step 1, which has carried through to this point in our iterative solution. Hence, return to step 5, assume another value for τ, and repeat the integration of Equation (16.65). Continue to repeat steps 5and 6 [using the same values of μ=μ(y)from step 4] until convergence is obtained, that is, until a value of τis found that, after the numerical integration of Equation (16.65), u=u eaty=D. From the converged velocity proﬁle obtained by repetition of steps 5 and 6, we now havenumerical values for uas a function of ythat satisfy both boundary conditions; that is, u=0 aty=0 and u=u eaty=D. However, do not forget that this converged solution was obtained using μ=μ(y)from step 4, which was obtained using the initially assumed τandu(y)from step 1. Therefore, the converged proﬁle for uobtained here is not necessarily the correct proﬁle. We must continue one big step further. 7.Return to step 2, using the new value of τand the new u(y)obtained from step 6. Repeat steps 2 through 7 until total convergence is obtained. Whenthis double iteration is completed, then the proﬁle for T=T(y)obtained at the last cycle of step 3, the proﬁle for u=u(y)obtained at the last cycle of step 6, and the value of τobtained at the last cycle of step 7 are all the correct values for the given boundary conditions. The problem is solved! Looking over the shooting method as described above, we see two minor iterationsnested within a major iteration. Steps 2 and 3 constitute the ﬁrst minor iterationand provide ultimately the temperature proﬁle. Steps 5 and 6 are the second minoriteration and provide ultimately the velocity proﬁle. Steps 2 to 7 constitute themajor iteration and ultimately result in the proper value of τ. The shooting method described above for the solution of compressible Couette ﬂow is carried over almost directly for the solution of the boundary-layer equations to be described in Chapter 18. In the same vein, there is another984 PART 4Viscous Flow completely different approach to the solution of compressible Couette ﬂow which carries over directly for the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations to be describedin Chapter 20. This is the time-dependent, ﬁnite-difference method, ﬁrst discussedin Chapter 13 and applied to the inviscid ﬂow over a supersonic blunt body inSection 13.5. In order to prepare ourselves for Chapter 20, we brieﬂy discuss theapplication of this method to the solution of compressible Couette ﬂow. 16.4.2 Time-Dependent Finite-Difference Method Return to the picture of Couette ﬂow in Figure 16.2. Imagine, for a moment, thatthe space between the upper and lower plates is ﬁlled with a ﬂow ﬁeld which isnota Couette ﬂow; for example, imagine some arbitrary ﬂow ﬁeld with gradients in both the xandydirections, including gradients in pressure. We can imagine such a ﬂow existing at some instant during the start-up process just after theupper plate is set into motion. This would be a transient ﬂow ﬁeld, where u,T, ρ, etc., would be functions of time tas well as of xandy. Finally, after enough time elapses, the ﬂow will approach a steady state, and this steady state will bethe Couette ﬂow solution discussed above. Let us track this picture numerically.That is, starting from an assumed initial ﬂow ﬁeld at time t=0, let us solve the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations in steps of time until a steady ﬂow is obtainedat large times. As discussed in Section 13.5, the time-asymptotic steady ﬂow isthe desired result; the time-dependent approach is just a means to that end. Atthis stage in our discussion, it would be well for you to review the philosophy(not the details) presented in Section 13.5 before progressing further. The Navier-Stokes equations are given by Equations (15.18 atoc) and (15.26). For an unsteady, two-dimensional ﬂow, they are Continuity:∂p ∂t=−∂(ρu) ∂x−∂(ρv) ∂y(16.66) x momentum:∂u ∂t=−u∂u ∂x−v∂u ∂y−1 ρ/bracketleftbigg∂p ∂x−∂τxx ∂x−∂τyz ∂y/bracketrightbigg (16.67) y momentum:∂v ∂t=−u∂v ∂x−v∂v ∂y−1 ρ/bracketleftbigg∂p ∂y−∂τxy ∂x−∂τyy ∂y/bracketrightbigg (16.68) Energy: ∂(e+V2/2) ∂t=−u∂(e+V2/2) ∂x−v∂(e+V2/2) ∂y(16.69) +1 ρ/braceleftbigg∂ ∂x/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂x/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg −∂(pu) ∂x−∂(pv) ∂y +∂(uτxx) ∂x+∂(uτyx) ∂y+∂(vτ xy) ∂x+∂(vτ yy) ∂y/bracerightbiggCHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 985 Note that Equations (16.66) to (16.69) are written with the time derivatives on the left-hand side and spatial derivatives on the right-hand side. These are analogousto the form of the Euler equations given by Equations (13.59) to (13.62). InEquations (16.67) to (16.69), τ xy,τxx, andτyyare given by Equations (15.5), (15.8), and (15.9), respectively. The above equations can be solved by means of MacCormack’s method as described in Chapter 13. This is a predictor-corrector approach, and its arrange-ment for the time-dependent method is described in Section 13.5. The applicationto compressible Couette ﬂow is outlined as follows: 1.Divide the space between the two plates into a ﬁnite-difference grid, as sketched in Figure 16.8a. The length Lof the grid is somewhat arbitrary, but it must be longer than a certain minimum, to be described shortly. 2.Atx=0 (the inﬂow boundary), specify some inﬂow conditions for u,v,ρ, andT(hence, e, since e=c vT). The incompressible solution for Couette ﬂow makes reasonable inﬂow boundary conditions. 3.At all the remaining grid points, arbitrarily assign values for all theﬂow-ﬁeld variables, u,v,ρ, and T. This arbitrary ﬂow ﬁeld, which constitutes the initial conditions at t=0, can have ﬁnite values of v, and can include pressure gradients. 4.Starting with the initial ﬂow ﬁeld established in step 3, solveEquations (16.66) to (16.69) in steps of time. For example, consider the x-momentum equation in the form of Equation (16.67). MacCormack’s predictor-corrector method, applied to this equation, is as follows. Predictor: Assume that we know the complete ﬂow ﬁeld at time t, and we wish to advance the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables to time t+/Delta1t.

The ﬂow-ﬁeld variables will change from one timestep to the next. This transient ﬂow ﬁeld will not even have parallelstreamlines (i.e., there will be ﬁnite values of vthroughout the ﬂow). This is sketched in Figure 16.8b. Make the calculations for a large number oftime steps; as we go out to large times, the changes in the ﬂow-ﬁeldvariables from one time step to another will become smaller. Finally, if wego out to a large enough time (hundreds, sometimes even thousands, oftime steps in some problems), the ﬂow-ﬁeld variables will not changeanymore—a steady ﬂow will be achieved, as sketched in Figure 16.8c.Moving from left to right in Figure 16.8c, we see a developing ﬂow near theentrance, inﬂuenced by the assumed inﬂow proﬁle. However, at the rightof Figure 16.8c, the history of the inﬂow has died out, and the ﬂow-ﬁeldproﬁles become independent of distance. Indeed, we have chosen Lto be a sufﬁcient length for this to occur. The ﬂow ﬁeld near the exit is the desiredsolution to the compressible Couette ﬂow problem. The value of /Delta1tin Equations (16.71) and (16.73) is not arbitrary. The steps outlined above constitute an explicit ﬁnite-difference method, and hence there is a stability bound on /Delta1t. The value of /Delta1tmust be less than some prescribed maximum, or else the numerical solution will become unstable and “blow up”988 PART 4Viscous Flow Figure 16.9 Velocity and temperature proﬁles for compressible Couette ﬂow.

Equation (16.74) is evaluated at every grid point, and the minimum value is used to advance the whole ﬂow ﬁeld. The time-dependent technique described above is a common approach to the solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, and for that reason, it hasbeen outlined here. Our purpose has been not so much to outline the solution ofCouette ﬂow by means of this technique, but rather to present the technique as aprecursor to our later discussions on Navier-Stokes solutions. 16.4.3 Results for Compressible Couette Flow Some typical results for compressible Couette ﬂow are shown in Figure 16.9 for acold wall case, and in Figure 16.10 for an adiabatic lower wall case. These resultsare obtained from White (Reference 41); they assume a viscosity-temperaturerelation of μ/μ max=(T/Tref)2/3, which is not quite as accurate for a gas as is Sutherland’s law [Equation (15.3)]. Recall from Section 15.6 that a compressibleviscous ﬂow is governed by the following similarity parameters: the Mach number,the Prandtl number, and the ratio of speciﬁc heats, γ. Therefore, we expect the results for compressible Couette ﬂow to be governed by the same parameters. Suchis the case, as illustrated in Figures 16.9 and 16.10. Here we see the differentCHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 989 Figure 16.10 Velocity and temperature proﬁles for compressible Couette ﬂow. Adiabatic lower wall. (Data Source: White, F. M.: Viscous Fluid Flow, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, 1974). ﬂow-ﬁeld proﬁles for different values of the combined parameter A=(γ− 1)PrM2 e. In particular, examining Figure 16.9 for the equal temperature, cold wall case, we note that: 1.From Figure 16.9a, the velocity proﬁles are not greatly affected by compressibility. The proﬁle labeled A=0 is the familiar linear incompressible case, and that labeled A=30 corresponds to Me approximately 10. Clearly, the velocity proﬁle (in terms of u/ueversus y/D) does not change greatly over such a large range of Mach number. 2.In contrast, from Figure 16.9b, there are huge temperature changes in theﬂow; these are due exclusively to viscous dissipation, which is a majoreffect at high Mach numbers. For example, for A=30(M e≈10), the temperature in the middle of the ﬂow is almost ﬁve times the walltemperature. Contrast this with the very small temperature increasecalculated in Example 16.1 for an incompressible ﬂow. This is why, on thescale in Figure 16.9b, the incompressible case (A=0)is seen as essentially a vertical line. For the adiabatic wall case shown in Figure 16.10, we note the following: 1.From Figure 16.10a, the velocity proﬁles show a pronounced curvature due to compressibility. 2.From Figure 16.10b, the temperature increases are larger than for the coldwall case. Note that, for A=30(M e≈10), the maximum temperature is over 15 times that of the upper wall. Also, note the results, familiar fromour discussion in Section 16.3, that the temperature is the largest at theadiabatic wall; that is, T awis the maximum temperature. As expected, Figure 16.10b shows that Tawincreases markedly as Meincreases.990 PART 4Viscous Flow In summary, in a general comparison between the incompressible ﬂow discussed in Section 16.3 and the compressible ﬂow discussed here, there is no tremendousqualitative change; that is, there is no discontinuous change in the ﬂow-ﬁeld behavior in going from subsonic to supersonic ﬂow as is the case for an inviscidﬂow, such as discussed in Part 3. Qualitatively, a supersonic viscous ﬂow is similarto a subsonic viscous ﬂow. On the other hand, there are tremendous quantitative differences, especially in regard to the large temperature changes that occur dueto massive viscous dissipation in a high-speed compressible viscous ﬂow. Thephysical reason for this difference in viscous versus inviscid ﬂow is as follows. Inan inviscid ﬂow, information is propagated via the mechanism of pressure wavestraveling throughout the ﬂow. This mechanism changes radically when the ﬂowgoes from subsonic to supersonic. In contrast, for a viscous ﬂow, informationis propagated by the diffusive transport mechanisms of μandk(a molecular phenomenon), and these mechanisms are not basically changed when the ﬂowgoes from subsonic to supersonic. These statements hold in general for any viscousﬂow, not just for the Couette ﬂow case treated here. 16.4.4 Some Analytical Considerations For air temperatures up to 1000 K, the speciﬁc heats are essentially constant, thusjustifying the assumption of a calorically perfect gas for this range. Moreover,the temperature variations of μandkover this range are virtually identical. As a result, the Prandtl number, μc p/k, is essentially constant up to temperatures on the order of 1000 K. This is shown in Figure 16.11 (Reference 50). Note thatPr≈0.71 for air; this is the value that was used in Example 16.1. Figure 16.11 Variation of viscosity coefﬁcient, thermal conductivity, and Prandtl number for air as a function of temperature. (Data Source: Schetz, Joseph A.: Foundations of Boundary Layer Theory for Momentum, Heat, and Mass Transfer, Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1984).CHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 991 Question: How high a Mach number can exist before we would expect to encounter temperatures in the ﬂow above 1000 K? Answer: An approximate answer is to calculate that Mach number at which the total temperature is 1000 K. Assuming a static temperature T=288 K, from Equation (8.40), M=/radicalBigg 2 γ−1/parenleftbiggT0 T−1/parenrightbigg =/radicalBigg 2 0.4/parenleftbigg1000 288−1/parenrightbigg =3.5 Hence, for most aeronautical applications involving ﬂight at a Mach number of3.5 or less, the temperature within the viscous portions of the ﬂow ﬁeld willnot exceed 1000 K. A Mach number of 3.5 or less encompasses virtually alloperational aircraft today, with the exception of a few hypersonic test vehicles. In light of the above, many viscous ﬂow solutions are carried out making the justiﬁable assumption of a constant Prandtl number. For the case of compressible Couette ﬂow, the assumption of Pr =constant allows the following analysis. Consider the energy equation, Equation (16.3), repeated below: ∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μu∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg =0 (16.3) Since T=h/cpand Pr =μcp/k, Equation (16.3) can be written as ∂ ∂y/parenleftbiggμ Pr∂h ∂y/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μu∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg =0 (16.75) or∂ ∂y/bracketleftbigg μ/parenleftbigg1 Pr∂h ∂y+u∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg =0 (16.76) Integrating Equation (16.76) with respect to y, we have 1 Pr∂h ∂y+u∂u ∂y=a μ(16.77) Since τ=μ(∂u/∂y), we have μ=τ(∂u/∂y)−1. Also, recalling from Equa- tion (16.61) that τis constant, we can write the right-hand side of Equa- tion (16.77) as a μ=a τ∂u ∂y=b∂u ∂y where bis a constant. With this, Equation (16.77) becomes 1 Pr∂h ∂y+∂(u2/2) ∂y−b∂u ∂y=0 (16.78) Integrating Equation (16.78) with respect to y, remembering that Pr =constant, we have h Pr+u2 2−bu=c (16.79)992 PART 4Viscous Flow where cis another constant of integration. Expressions for bandccan be obtained by evaluating Equation (16.79) at y=0 and y=D.

Differentiating Equa- tion (16.80) with respect to y, we have ∂h ∂y=− Pru∂u ∂y+/parenleftbigghe+hw ue/parenrightbigg∂u ∂y+uePr 2∂u ∂y or∂h ∂y=/parenleftbigg −uPr+he−hw ue+uePr 2/parenrightbigg∂u ∂y(16.81) Recall that the condition for an adiabatic wall is that (∂h/∂y)w=0. Applying Equation (16.81) at y=0 for an adiabatic wall, where u=0 and by deﬁnition hw=haw, we have /parenleftbigg∂h ∂y/parenrightbigg w=/parenleftbigghe−haw ue+uePr 2/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg w=0 Since(∂u/∂y)wis ﬁnite, then he−haw ue+uePr 2=0 or haw=he+Pru2 e 2(16.82) This is identical to Equation (16.39) obtained for incompressible ﬂow. Hence, we have just proven that the recovery factor for compressible Couette ﬂow, assumingconstant Prandtl number, is also r=Pr (16.83) Since the recovery factors for the incompressible and compressible cases are the same (as long as Pr =constant), what can we say about Reynolds anal- ogy? Does Equation (16.59) hold for the compressible case? Let us examine thisquestion. Return to Equation (16.3), repeated below: ∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μu∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg =0 (16.3)CHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 993 Recalling that, from the deﬁnitions, ˙q=k∂T ∂y(16.84) and τ=μ∂u ∂y(16.85) then Equation (16.3) can be written as ∂˙q ∂y+∂(τu) ∂y=0 (16.86) Integrating Equation (16.86) with respect to y, we have ˙q+τu=a (16.87) where ais a constant of integration. Evaluating Equation (16.87) at y=0, where u=0 and ˙q=qw, we ﬁnd that a=˙qw Hence, Equation (16.87) is ˙q+τu=˙qw (16.88) Inserting Equations (16.84) and (16.85) into (16.88), we have ˙qw=k∂T ∂y+μu∂u ∂y(16.89) or˙qw μ=k μ∂T ∂y+u∂u ∂y(16.90) Recall that the shear stress is constant throughout the ﬂow; hence, τ=μ∂u ∂y=τw or μ=τw ∂u/∂y(16.91) Also,k μ=cp Pr(16.92) Inserting Equation (16.91) into the left-hand side of Equation (16.90), and Equa- tion (16.92) into the right-hand side of Equation (16.90), we have ˙qw τw∂u ∂y=cp Pr∂T ∂y+∂(u2/2) ∂y(16.93) Integrate Equation (16.93) between the two plates, keeping in mind that ˙qw,τw, cp, and Pr are all ﬁxed values: ˙qw τw/integraldisplayD 0∂u ∂ydy=cp Pr/integraldisplayD 0∂T ∂ydy+/integraldisplayD 0∂(u2/2) ∂ydy994 PART 4Viscous Flow or˙qw τw/integraldisplayue 0du=cp Pr/integraldisplayTe TwdT+/integraldisplayue 0d/parenleftbiggu2 2/parenrightbigg which yields ˙qw τwue=cp Pr(Te−Tw)+u2 e 2(16.94) Rearranging Equation (16.94), and recalling that h=cpT, we have ˙qw=τw uePr/parenleftbigg he−hw+Pru2e 2/parenrightbigg (16.95) Inserting Equation (16.82) into (16.95), we have ˙qw=τw uePr(haw−hw) (16.96) The skin-friction coefﬁcient and Stanton number are deﬁned by Equations (16.51) and (16.55), respectively. Thus, their ratio is CH cf=˙qw/[ρ eue(haw−hw)] τw//parenleftbig1 2ρeu2 e/parenrightbig =˙qw τw/bracketleftbiggue 2(haw−hw)/bracketrightbigg (16.97) Inserting Equation (16.96) into (16.97), we have CH cf=(haw−hw) uePr/bracketleftbiggue 2(haw−hw)/bracketrightbigg orCH cf=1 2Pr−1(16.98) Equation (16.98) is Reynolds analogy—a relation between heat transfer and skin friction coefﬁcients. Moreover, it is precisely the same result as obtained in Equa- tion (16.59) for incompressible ﬂow. Hence, for a constant Prandtl number, wehave shown that Reynolds analogy is precisely the same form for incompressibleand compressible ﬂow. EXAMPLE 16.2 Consider the geometry given in Figure 16.2. The two plates are separated by a distance of 0.01 in (the same as in Example 16.1). The temperature of the two plates is equal, at avalue of 288 K (standard sea level temperature). The air pressure is constant throughoutthe ﬂow and equal to 1 atm. The upper plate is moving at Mach 3. The shear stress at thelower wall is 72 N/m (This is about 1.5 lb/ft2—a much larger value than that associated with the low-speed case treated in Example 16.1.) Calculate the heat transfer to eitherplate. (Since the shear stress is constant throughout the ﬂow, and the plates are at equaltemperature, the heat transfer to the upper and lower plates is the same.)CHAPTER 16 A Special Case: Couette Flow 995 ■Solution The velocity of the upper plate is ue=Meae=Me/radicalbig γRTe=3/radicalbig (1.4)(288)(287) =1020 m/s The air density at both plates is (noting that 1 atm =1.01×105N/m2) ρe=pe RTe=1.01×105 (287)(288)=1.22 kg/m3 Hence, the skin-friction coefﬁcient is cf=τw 1 2ρeu2e=72 (0.5)(1.22)(1020)2=1.13×10−4 From Reynolds analogy, Equation (16.92), we have CH=cf 2 Pr=1.13×10−4 2(0.71)=8×10−5 The adiabatic wall enthalpy, from Equation (16.82), is haw=he+Pru2 e 2=cpTe+Pru2e 2 For air, cp=1004.5 J/kg ·K. Thus, haw=(1004.5)(288) +(0.71)(1020)2 2=6.59×105J/kg [Note: This gives Taw=haw/cp=(6.59×105)/1004.5 =656 K. In the adiabatic case, the wall would be quite warm.] Hence, from the deﬁnition of the Stanton number [Equation (16.55)], and noting that hw=cpTw=(1004.6)(288) =2.89×105J/kg, ˙qw=ρeue(haw−hw)CH=(1.22)(1020)[(6.59 −2.89)×105](8×10−5) =3.68×104W/m2 16.5 SUMMARY The parallel ﬂow discussed in this chapter illustrates features common to many more complex viscous ﬂows, with the added advantage of lending itself to arelatively straightforward solution. The purpose of this discussion has been tointroduce many of the basic concepts of viscous ﬂows in a fashion unencumberedby ﬂuid dynamic complexities. In particular, we have studied Couette ﬂow andfound the following. 1.The driving force is the shear stress between the moving wall and the ﬂuid.

If the viscosity was very small and the ﬂuid pathalong the wall not too long, the ﬂuid velocity ought to resume its normal valueat a very short distance from the wall. In the thin transition layer however, thesharp changes of velocity, even with small coefﬁcient of friction, producemarked results. Ludwig Prandtl, 1904 PREVIEW BOX The revelations in this chapter are simply amazing. Although the inﬂuence of friction is present at ev-ery point throughout every ﬂow, on a practical ba-sis it is usually of no consequence except in a thin region adjacent to the surface of a body immersedin the ﬂow, or in the boundary region between twoﬂows of widely different velocities. For the former,the thin region is called a boundary layer, and for the latter it is called a shear layer. After centuries of trying to solve ﬂows taking into account friction,most to no avail, the introduction of the boundary-layer concept revolutionized ﬂuid dynamics and madethe analysis of ﬂows with friction tractable. It is amaz-ing that what goes on inside the thin boundary layeris the physical mechanism for skin friction and aero-dynamic heating to the surface, and for ﬂow sepa-ration from the surface. It is truly amazing that tocalculate skin friction and aerodynamic heating at thesurface, we have only to account for friction and ther-mal conduction within the thin boundary layer, andnotin the large region of ﬂow outside the boundary layer. This chapter is all about boundary layers. Read on, and be prepared to be amazed. 997998 PART 4Viscous Flow 17.1 INTRODUCTION The above quotation is taken from an historic paper given by Ludwig Prandtl at the third Congress of Mathematicians at Heidelberg, Germany, in 1904. In thispaper, the concept of the boundary layer was ﬁrst introduced—a concept whicheventually revolutionized the analysis of viscous ﬂows in the twentieth centuryand which allowed the practical calculation of drag and ﬂow separation overaerodynamic bodies. Before Prandtl’s 1904 paper, the Navier-Stokes equationsdiscussed in Chapter 15 were well known, but ﬂuid dynamicists were frustrated intheir attempts to solve these equations for practical engineering problems. After1904, the picture changed completely. Using Prandtl’s concept of a boundarylayer adjacent to an aerodynamic surface, the Navier-Stokes equations can bereduced to a more tractable form called the boundary-layer equations. In turn, these boundary-layer equations can be solved to obtain the distributions of shearstress and aerodynamic heat transfer to the surface. Prandtl’s boundary-layerconcept was an advancement in the science of ﬂuid mechanics of the caliberof a Nobel prize, although he never received that honor. The purpose of thischapter is to present the general concept of the boundary layer and to give a fewrepresentative samples of its application. Our purpose here is to provide only anintroduction to boundary-layer theory; consult Reference 40 for a rigorous andthorough discussion of boundary-layer analysis and applications. Also, a generalintroduction to boundary layers was given in Section 1.11. If you have not readthat section, now would be a good time to pause and return to Section 1.11 beforeprogressing further. What is a boundary layer? We have used this term in several places in our previous chapters, ﬁrst introducing the idea in Section 1.10 and illustrating theconcept in Figure 1.42. The boundary layer is the thin region of ﬂow adjacent to asurface, where the ﬂow is retarded by the inﬂuence of friction between a solid sur-face and the ﬂuid. For example, a photograph of the ﬂow over a supersonic body isshown in Figure 17.1, where the boundary layer (along with shock and expansionwaves and the wake) is made visible by a special optical technique called a shad- owgraph (see References 25 and 26 for discussions of the shadowgraph method). Note how thin the boundary layer is in comparison with the size of the body;however, although the boundary layer occupies geometrically only a small por-tion of the ﬂow ﬁeld, its inﬂuence on the drag and heat transfer to the body isimmense—in Prandtl’s own words as quoted above, it produces “marked results.” The purpose of the remaining chapters is to examine these “marked results.” The road map for the present chapter is given in Figure 17.2. In the next section,we discuss some fundamental properties of boundary layers. This is followedby a development of the boundary-layer equations, which are the continuity,momentum, and energy equations written in a special form applicable to the ﬂowin the thin viscous region adjacent to a surface. The boundary layer equations arepartial differential equations that apply inside the boundary layer. Finally, we note that this chapter represents the second of the three options discussed in Section 15.7 for the solution of the viscous ﬂow equations, namely,CHAPTER 17 Introduction to Boundary Layers 999 Boundary layer Figure 17.1 The boundary layer on an aerodynamic body (© H.S. Photos/Alamy). Figure 17.2 Road map for Chapter 17.1000 PART 4Viscous Flow the simpliﬁcation of the Navier-Stokes equations by neglecting certain terms that are smaller than other terms. This is an approximation, not a precise condition as inthe case of Couette and Poiseuille ﬂows in Chapter 16. In this chapter, we will seethat the Navier-Stokes equations, when applied to the thin viscous boundary layeradjacent to a surface, can be reduced to simpler forms, albeit approximate, whichlend themselves to simpler solutions. These simpler forms of the equations arecalled the boundary-layer equations—they are the subject of the present chapter. 17.2 BOUNDARY-LAYER PROPERTIES Consider the viscous ﬂow over a ﬂat plate as sketched in Figure 17.3. The viscouseffects are contained within a thin layer adjacent to the surface; the thickness isexaggerated in Figure 17.3 for clarity. Immediately at the surface, the ﬂow velocityis zero; this is the “no-slip” condition discussed in Section 15.2. In addition, thetemperature of the ﬂuid immediately at the surface is equal to the temperatureof the surface; this is called the wall temperature T w, as shown in Figure 17.3. Above the surface, the ﬂow velocity increases in the ydirection until, for all practical purposes, it equals the freestream velocity. This will occur at a heightabove the wall equal to δ, as shown in Figure 17.3. More precisely, δis deﬁned as that distance above the wall where u=0.99u e; here, ueis the velocity at the outer edge of the boundary layer. In Figure 17.3, which illustrates the ﬂowover a ﬂat plate, the velocity at the edge of the boundary layer will be V ∞; that is,ue=V∞. For a body of general shape, ueis the velocity obtained from an inviscid ﬂow solution evaluated at the body surface (or at the “effective body”surface, as discussed later). The quantity δis called the velocity boundary-layer thickness. At any given xstation, the variation of ubetween y=0 and y=δ, that is, u=u(y), is deﬁned as the velocity proﬁle within the boundary layer, as sketched in Figure 17.3. This proﬁle is different for different xstations. Similarly, the ﬂow temperature will change above the wall, ranging from T=T waty=0 toT=0.99Teaty=δT. Here, δTis deﬁned as the thermal boundary-layer thickness. At any given xstation, the variation of Tbetween y=0 and y=δT, that is, T=T(y), is called the temperature proﬁle within the boundary layer, as sketched in Figure 17.3.

For the ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, as sketched in Figure 17.3, Te=T∞. For a general body, Teis obtained from an inviscid ﬂow solution evaluated at the body surface, or at the “effective body” surface, to be discussed later.) Hence, two boundary layers can be deﬁned: a velocity boundary layerwith thickness δand a temperature boundary layer with thickness δ T. In general, δT/negationslash=δ. The relative thicknesses depend on the Prandtl number: it can be shown that if Pr =1, then δ=δT; if Pr >1, then δT<δ; if Pr <1, then δT>δ. For air at standard conditions, Pr =0.71; hence, the thermal boundary layer is thicker than the velocity boundary layer, as shown in Figure 17.3. Note that bothboundary-layer thicknesses increase with distance from the leading edge; that is,δ=δ(x)andδ T=δT(x). The consequence of the velocity gradient at the wall is the generation of shear stress at the wall, τw=μ/parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg w(17.1) where (∂u/∂y)wis the velocity gradient evaluated at y=0 (i.e., at the wall). Similarly, the temperature gradient at the wall generates heat transfer at the wall, ˙qw=−k/parenleftbigg∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg w(17.2) where (∂T/∂y)wis the temperature gradient evaluated at y=0 (i.e., at the wall). In general, both τwand˙qware functions of distance from the leading edge; that is,τw=τw(x)and˙qw=˙qw(x). One of the central purposes of boundary-layer theory is to compute τwand˙qw. A frequently used boundary-layer property is the displacement thickness δ∗, deﬁned as δ∗≡/integraldisplayy1 0/parenleftbigg 1−ρu ρeue/parenrightbigg dyδ≤y1→∞ (17.3) The displacement thickness has two physical interpretations: 1.δ∗is an index proportional to the “missing mass ﬂow” due to the presence of the boundary layer. Let us explain. Consider point y1above the boundary layer, as shown in Figure 17.4. Consider also the mass ﬂow (per unit depth perpendicular to the page) across the vertical line connecting y=0 and y=y1. Then A=actual mass ﬂow between 0 and y1=/integraldisplayy1 0ρudy B=hypothetical mass ﬂowbetween 0 and y 1ifboundary layer were not present=/integraldisplayy1 0ρeuedy B−A=decrement in mass ﬂow due topresence of boundary layer, that is,missing mass ﬂow=/integraldisplayy1 0(ρeue−ρu)dy (17.4)1002 PART 4Viscous Flow Edge of boundary layerue /H9267e udy /H9267y /H11005 y1 y /H11005 0 Figure 17.4 Construction for the discussion of displacement thickness. uStreamline Boundary layerExternal streamline 12 Hypothetical flow with no boundary layer(inviscid case)Actual flow with a boundary layeru e /H9267ey1ue /H9267e /H9267y1/H9254* /H9254 Figure 17.5 Displacement thickness is the distance by which an external ﬂow streamline is displaced by the presence of the boundary layer. Express this missing mass ﬂow as the product of ρeueand a height δ∗; that is, Missing mass ﬂow =ρeueδ∗(17.5) Equating Equations (17.4) and (17.5), we have ρeueδ∗=/integraldisplayy1 0(ρeue−ρu)dy or δ∗=/integraldisplayy1 0/parenleftbigg 1−ρu ρeue/parenrightbigg dy (17.6) Equation (17.6) is identical to the deﬁnition of δ∗given in Equation (17.3). Hence, clearly δ∗is a height proportional to the missing mass ﬂow. If this missing mass ﬂow was crammed into a streamtube where the ﬂow properties were constant at ρeandue, then Equation (17.5) says that δ∗is the height of this hypothetical streamtube. 2.The second physical interpretation of δ∗is more practical than the one discussed above. Consider the ﬂow over a ﬂat surface as sketched inFigure 17.5. At the left is a picture of the hypothetical inviscid ﬂow over thesurface; a streamline through point y 1is straight and parallel to the surface.CHAPTER 17 Introduction to Boundary Layers 1003 The actual viscous ﬂow is shown at the right of Figure 17.5; here, the retarded ﬂow inside the boundary layer acts as a partial obstruction to thefreestream ﬂow. As a result, the streamline external to the boundary layerpassing through point y 1is deﬂected upward through a distance δ∗.W en o w prove that this δ∗is precisely the displacement thickness deﬁned by Equation (17.3). At station 1 in Figure 17.5, the mass ﬂow (per unit depthperpendicular to the page) between the surface and the external streamline is ˙m=/integraldisplayy1 0ρeuedy (17.7) At station 2, the mass ﬂow between the surface and the external streamline is ˙m=/integraldisplayy1 0ρudy+ρeueδ∗(17.8) Since the surface and the external streamline form the boundaries of astreamtube, the mass ﬂows across stations 1 and 2 are equal. Hence,equating Equations (17.7) and (17.8), we have /integraldisplayy1 0ρeuedy=/integraldisplayy1 0ρudy+ρeueδ∗ or δ∗=/integraldisplayy1 0/parenleftbigg 1−ρu ρeue/parenrightbigg dy (17.9) Hence, the height by which the streamline in Figure 17.5 is displacedupward by the presence of the boundary layer, namely, δ ∗, is given by Equation (17.9). However, Equation (17.9) is precisely the deﬁnition of thedisplacement thickness given by Equation (17.3). Thus, the displacementthickness, ﬁrst deﬁned by Equation (17.3), is physically the distancethrough which the external inviscid ﬂow is displaced by the presence of theboundary layer. This second interpretation of δ ∗gives rise to the concept of an effective body. Consider the aerodynamic shape sketched in Figure 17.6. The actual contour of Figure 17.6 The “effective body,” equal to the actual body shape plus the displacement thickness distribution.1004 PART 4Viscous Flow the body is given by curve ab. However, due to the displacement effect of the boundary layer, the shape of the body effectively seen by the freestream is not given by curve ab; rather, the freestream sees an effective body given by curve ac. In order to obtain the conditions ρe,ue,Te, etc., at the outer edge of the boundary layer on the actual body ab, an inviscid ﬂow solution should be carried out for the effective body, and ρe,ue,Te, etc., are obtained from this inviscid solution evaluated along curve ac. Note that in order to solve for δ∗from Equation (17.3), we need the proﬁles ofuandρfrom a solution of the boundary-layer ﬂow. In turn, to solve the boundary-layer ﬂow, we need ρe,ue,Te, etc. However, ρe,ue,Te, etc., depend on δ∗. This leads to an iterative solution. To calculate accurately the boundary-layer properties as well as the pressure distribution over the surface of the body inFigure 17.6, we proceed as follows: 1.Carry out an inviscid solution for the given body shape ab. Evaluate ρ e,ue, Te, etc., along curve ab. 2.Using these values of ρe,ue,Te, etc., solve the boundary-layer equations (discussed in Sections 17.3 to 17.6) for u=u(y),ρ=ρ(y), etc., at various stations along the body. 3.Obtain δ∗at these stations from Equation (17.3). This will not be an accurate δ∗because ρe,ue,Te, etc., were evaluated on curve ab, not the proper effective body. Using this intermediate δ∗, calculate an effective body, given by a curve ac/prime(not shown in Figure 17.6). 4.Carry out an inviscid solution for the ﬂow over the intermediate effective body ac/prime, and evaluate new values of ρe,ue,Te, etc., along ac/prime. 5.Repeat steps 2 to 4 above until the solution at one iteration essentially doesnot deviate from the solution at the previous iteration. At this stage, aconverged solution will be obtained, and the ﬁnal results will pertain to theﬂow over the proper effective body acshown in Figure 17.6. In some cases, the boundary layers are so thin that the effective body can be ignored, and a boundary-layer solution can proceed directly from ρ e,ue,Te, etc., obtained from an inviscid solution evaluated on the actual body surface(abin Figure 17.6). However, for highly accurate solutions, and for cases where the boundary-layer thickness is relatively large (such as for hypersonic ﬂow asdiscussed in Chapter 14), the iterative procedure described above should be carriedout. Also, we note parenthetically that δ ∗is usually smaller than δ; typically, δ∗≈0.3δ. Another boundary-layer property of importance is the momentum thickness θ, deﬁned as θ≡/integraldisplayy1 0ρu ρeue/parenleftbigg 1−u ue/parenrightbigg dy δ≤y1→∞ (17.10)CHAPTER 17 Introduction to Boundary Layers 1005 To understand the physical interpretation of θ, return again to Figure 17.4.

Then A=momentum ﬂow across dy=dm u=ρu2dy If this same elemental mass ﬂow were associated with the freestream, where the velocity is ue, then B=/braceleftbiggmomentum ﬂow at freestreamvelocity associated with mass dm=dm u e=(ρudy)ue Hence, B−A=⎧ ⎨ ⎩decrement in momentum ﬂow (missing momentum ﬂow) associated =ρu(ue−u)dy with mass dm(17.11) Thetotal decrement in momentum ﬂow across the vertical line from y=0 to y=y1in Figure 17.4 is the integral of Equation (17.11), Total decrement in momentumﬂow, or missing momentum ﬂow/bracerightbigg =/integraldisplayy1 0ρu(ue−u)dy (17.12) Assume that the missing momentum ﬂow is the product of ρeu2 eand a height θ. Then, Missing momentum ﬂow =ρeu2eθ (17.13) Equating Equations (17.12) and (17.13), we obtain ρeu2 eθ=/integraldisplayy1 0ρu(ue−u)dy θ=/integraldisplayy1 0ρu ρeue/parenleftbigg 1−u ue/parenrightbigg dy (17.14) Equation (17.14) is precisely the deﬁnition of the momentum thickness given by Equation (17.10). Therefore, θis an index that is proportional to the decrement in momentum ﬂow due to the presence of the boundary layer. It is the heightof a hypothetical streamtube which is carrying the missing momentum ﬂow atfreestream conditions. Note that θ=θ(x). In more detailed discussions of boundary-layer theory, it can be shown that θevaluated at a given station x=x 1is proportional to the integrated friction drag coefﬁcient from the leading edge to x1; that is, θ(x1)∝1 x1/integraldisplayx1 0cfdx=Cf where cfis the local skin-friction coefﬁcient deﬁned in Section 1.5 and Cfis the total skin-friction drag coefﬁcient for the length of surface from x=0 tox=x1. Hence, the concept of momentum thickness is useful in the prediction of dragcoefﬁcient. All the boundary-layer properties discussed above are general concepts; they apply to compressible as well as incompressible ﬂows, and to turbulent as well1006 PART 4Viscous Flow as laminar ﬂows. The differences between turbulent and laminar ﬂows were in- troduced in Section 15.2. Here, we extend that discussion by noting that theincreased momentum and energy exchange that occur within a turbulent ﬂowcause a turbulent boundary layer to be thicker than a laminar boundary layer.That is, for the same edge conditions, ρ e,ue,Te, etc., we have δturbulent >δ laminar and(δT)turbulent > (δ T)laminar . When a boundary layer changes from laminar to tur- bulent ﬂow, as sketched in Figure 15.8, the boundary-layer thickness markedlyincreases. Similarly, δ ∗andθare larger for turbulent ﬂows. 17.3 THE BOUNDARY-LAYER EQUATIONS For the remainder of this chapter, we consider two-dimensional, steady ﬂow. Thenondimensionalized form of the x-momentum equation (one of the Navier-Stokes equations) was developed in Section 15.6 and was given by Equation (15.29): ρ /primeu/prime∂u/prime ∂x/prime+ρ/primev/prime∂u/prime ∂y/prime=−1 γM2 ∞∂p/prime ∂x/prime+1 Re∞∂ ∂y/prime/bracketleftbigg μ/prime/parenleftbigg∂v/prime ∂x/prime+∂u/prime ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (15.29) Let us now reduce Equation (15.29) to an approximate form which holds reason-ably well within a boundary layer. Consider the boundary layer along a ﬂat plate of length cas sketched in Figure 17.7. The basic assumption of boundary-layer theory is that a boundarylayer is very thin in comparison with the scale of the body; that is, δ/lessmuchc (17.15) Consider the continuity equation for a steady, two-dimensional ﬂow, ∂(ρu) ∂x+∂(ρv) ∂y=0 (17.16) In terms of the nondimensional variables deﬁned in Section 15.6, Equation (17.16)becomes ∂(ρ /primeu/prime) ∂x/prime+∂(ρ/primev/prime) ∂y/prime=0 (17.17) Because u/primevaries from 0 at the wall to 1 at the edge of the boundary layer, let us say that u/primeis of the order of magnitude equal to 1, symbolized by O(1). Similarly, V/H11009y x c/H9254 /H11021/H11021 c /H9254 Figure 17.7 The basic assumption of boundary-layer theory: A boundary layer is very thin in comparison with the scale of the body.CHAPTER 17 Introduction to Boundary Layers 1007 ρ/prime=O(1). Also, since xvaries from 0 to c,x/prime=O(1). However, since yvaries from 0 to δ, where δ/lessmuchc, then y/primeis of the smaller order of magnitude, denoted byy/prime=O(δ/c). Without loss of generality, we can assume that cis a unit length. Therefore, y/prime=O(δ). Putting these orders of magnitude in Equation (17.17), we have [O(1)][ O(1)] O(1)+[O(1)][v/prime] O(δ)=0 (17.18) Hence, from Equation (17.18), clearly v/primemust be of an order of magnitude equal toδ; that is, v/prime=O(δ). Now examine the order of magnitude of the terms in Equation (15.29). We have ρ/primeu/prime∂u/prime ∂x/prime=O(1)ρ/primev/prime∂u/prime ∂y/prime=O(1)∂p/prime ∂x/prime=O(1) ∂ ∂y/prime/parenleftbigg μ/prime∂v/prime ∂x/prime/parenrightbigg =O(1)∂ ∂y/prime/parenleftbigg μ/prime∂u/prime ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg =O/parenleftbigg1 δ2/parenrightbigg Hence, the order-of-magnitude equation for Equation (15.29) can be written as O(1)+O(1)=−1 γM2 ∞O(1)+1 Re∞/bracketleftbigg O(1)+O/parenleftbigg1 δ2/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (17.19) Let us now introduce another assumption of boundary-layer theory, namely, the Reynolds number is large, indeed, large enough such that 1 Re∞=O(δ2) (17.20) Then, Equation (17.19) becomes O(1)+O(1)=−1 γM2 ∞O(1)+O(δ2)/bracketleftbigg O(1)+O/parenleftbigg1 δ2/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (17.21) In Equation (17.21), there is one term with an order of magnitude that is muchsmaller than the rest, namely, the product O(δ 2)[O(1)]=O(δ2). This term corresponds to (1/Re ∞)∂/∂ y/prime(μ/prime∂v/prime/∂x/prime)in Equation (15.29). Hence, neglect this term in comparison to the remaining terms in Equation (15.29). We obtain ρ/primeu/prime∂u/prime ∂x/prime+ρ/primev/prime∂u/prime ∂y/prime=−1 γM2 ∞∂p/prime ∂x/prime+1 Re∞∂ ∂y/prime/parenleftbigg μ/prime∂u/prime ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg (17.22) In terms of dimensional variables, Equation (17.22) is ρu∂u ∂x+ρv∂u ∂y=−∂p ∂x+∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μ∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg (17.23) Equation (17.23) is the approximate x-momentum equation which holds for ﬂow in a thin boundary layer at a high Reynolds number.1008 PART 4Viscous Flow Consider the y-momentum equation for two-dimensional, steady ﬂow, ob- tained from Equation (15.19b ) as (neglecting the normal stress τyy) ρu∂v ∂x+ρv∂v ∂y=−∂p ∂y+∂ ∂x/bracketleftbigg μ/parenleftbigg∂v ∂x+∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (17.24) In terms of the nondimensional variables, Equation (17.24) becomes ρ/primeu/prime∂v/prime ∂x/prime+ρ/primev/prime∂v/prime ∂y/prime=−1 γM2 ∞∂p/prime ∂y/prime+1 Re∞∂ ∂x/prime/bracketleftbigg μ/prime/parenleftbigg∂v/prime ∂x/prime+∂u/prime ∂y/prime/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (17.25) The order-of-magnitude equation for Equation (17.25) is O(δ)+O(δ)=−1 γM2 ∞∂p/prime ∂y/prime+O(δ2)/bracketleftbigg O(δ)+O/parenleftbigg1 δ/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (17.26) From Equation (17.26), we see that ∂p/prime/∂y/prime=O(δ)or smaller, assuming that γM2 ∞=O(1). Since δis very small, this implies that ∂p/prime/∂y/primeis very small. Therefore, from the y-momentum equation specialized to a boundary layer, we have ∂p ∂y=0 (17.26a) Equation (17.26 a) is important; it states that at a given xstation, the pressure is constant through the boundary layer in a direction normal to the surface. This implies that the pressure distribution at the outer edge of the boundary layer isimpressed directly to the surface without change. Hence, throughout the boundarylayer, p=p(x)=p e(x). It is interesting to note that if M2 ∞is very large, as in the case of large hypersonic Mach numbers, then from Equation (17.26) ∂p/prime/∂y/primedoes not have to be small. For example, if M∞were large enough such that 1/γ M2 ∞=O(δ), then ∂p/prime/∂y/primecould be as large as O(1), and Equation (17.26) would still be satisﬁed. Thus, for very large hypersonic Mach numbers, the assumption that pis constant in the normal direction through a boundary layer is not always valid. Consider the general energy equation given by Equation (15.26). The nondi- mensional form of this equation for two-dimensional, steady ﬂow is given inEquation (15.33). Inserting e=h−p/ρinto this equation, subtracting the mo- mentum equation multiplied by velocity, and performing an order-of-magnitudeanalysis similar to those above, we can obtain the boundary-layer energy equa-tion as ρu∂h ∂x+ρv∂h ∂y=∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg +u∂p ∂x+μ/parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg2 (17.27) The details are left to you. In summary, by making the combined assumptions of δ/lessmuchcand Re ≥1/δ2, the complete Navier-Stokes equations derived in Chapter 15 can be reduced toCHAPTER 17 Introduction to Boundary Layers 1009 simpler forms which apply to a boundary layer. These boundary-layer equa- tions are Continuity:∂(ρu) ∂x+∂(ρv) ∂y=0 (17.28) x momentum: ρu∂u ∂x+ρv∂u ∂y=−dpe dx+∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μ∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg (17.29) y momentum:∂p ∂y=0 (17.30) Energy: ρu∂h ∂x+ρv∂h ∂y=∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg +udpe dx+μ/parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg2 (17.31) Note that, as in the case of the Navier-Stokes equations, the boundary-layer equa-tions are nonlinear. However, the boundary-layer equations are simpler, and there-fore are more readily solved. Also, since p=p e(x), the pressure gradient ex- pressed as ∂p/∂xin Equations (17.23) and (17.27) is reexpressed as dpe/dx in Equations (17.29) and (17.31). In the above equations, the unknowns are u,v,ρ, andh;pis known from p=pe(x), and μandkare properties of the ﬂuid which vary with temperature. To complete the system, we have p=ρRT (17.32) h=cpT (17.33) and Hence, Equations (17.28), (17.29), and (17.31) to (17.33) are ﬁve equations for the ﬁve unknowns, u,v,ρ,T, and h. The boundary conditions for the above equations are as follows: At the wall: y =0u=0v=0T=Tw At the boundary-layer edge: y →∞ u→ueT→Te Note that since the boundary-layer thickness is not known a priori, the boundarycondition at the edge of the boundary layer is given at large y, essentially y approaching inﬁnity. 17.4 HOW DO WE SOLVE THE BOUNDARY-LAYER EQUATIONS? Examine again the boundary-layer equations given by Equations (17.28) to(17.31). With these equations, are we still in the same “soup” as we are withthe complete Navier-Stokes equations, in that the equations are a coupled system1010 PART 4Viscous Flow of nonlinear partial differential equations for which no general analytical solution has been obtained to date? The answer is partly yes, but with a difference. Becausethe boundary-layer equations are simpler than the Navier-Stokes equations, espe-cially the boundary-layer y-momentum equation, Equation (17.30), which states that at any axial location along the surface the pressure is constant in the directionnormal to the surface, there is more hope of obtaining meaningful solutions forthe ﬂow inside a boundary layer. For almost one hundred years, engineers andscientists have “nudged” the boundary layer equations in many different ways,and have come up with reasonable solutions for a number of practical applica-tions. The most complete and authoritative book on such solutions is by HermannSchlichting (Reference 40). In Chapters 18 and 19 we will discuss some of these solutions—their tech- nique and some practical results. Solutions of the boundary layer equations canbe classiﬁed into two groups: (1) classical solutions, some of which date back to1908, and (2) numerical solutions obtained by modern computational ﬂuid dy-namic techniques. In the subsequent chapters, we will show examples from bothgroups. In addition to this subdivision based on the solution technique, boundary-layer solutions also subdivide on a physical basis into laminar boundary layers and turbulent boundary layers. This subdivision is natural for the reasons dis-cussed in Section 15.2—the nature of turbulent ﬂow is quite different than thatof laminar ﬂow. Indeed, for certain types of ﬂow problems, exact solutions have been obtained for laminar boundary layers. To date, noexact solution has been obtained for turbulent boundary layers, because we still do not have a completeunderstanding of turbulence, and hence all turbulent boundary-layer solutionsto date have depended on the use of some type of approximate model of turbu-lence. These contrasts will become more clear when you read Chapter 18, whichdeals with laminar boundary layers, and Chapter 19, which deals with turbulentboundary layers. You will see that laminar boundary-layer theory is well in hand,but turbulent boundary-layer theory is not. In some sense, what a pity that na-ture always tends toward turbulent ﬂow, and hence the vast majority of practicalboundary-layer problems deal with turbulent boundary layers—if it were the otherway around, the engineering calculation of skin friction and aerodynamic heatingat the surface would be much simpler and more reliable. Finally, we note what is meant by a “boundary-layer solution.” The solution of Equations (17.28) to (17.31) yields the velocity and temperature proﬁles through-out the boundary layer. However, the practical information we want is the solution forτ wand˙qw, the surface shear stress and heat transfer, respectively. These are given by τw=μw/parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg w(17.34) ˙qw=kw/parenleftbigg∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg w(17.35) and where the subscript wdenotes conditions at the wall. Question: Where do val- ues of (∂u/∂y)wand(∂T/∂y)wcome from? Answer: From the velocity andCHAPTER 17 Introduction to Boundary Layers 1011 temperature proﬁles obtained from a solution of the boundary layer equations, where the proﬁles evaluated at the wall provide both (∂u/∂y)wand(∂T/∂y)w. Hence in order to obtain the values for τwand˙qwalong the wall, which are usually considered the engineering results of most importance, we ﬁrst have to solve theboundary-layer equations for the velocity and temperature proﬁles throughout theboundary layer, which by themselves usually are of lesser practical interest. 17.5 SUMMARY Return to the road map given in Figure 17.2, and make certain that you feel athome with the material represented by each box. The highlights of our discussionof boundary layers are summarized as follows: The basic quantities of interest from boundary-layer theory are the velocity andthermal boundary-layer thicknesses, δandδ T, respectively, the shear stress at the wall, τw, and heat transfer to the surface, ˙qw. In the process, we can deﬁne two additional thicknesses: the displacement thickness δ∗≡/integraldisplayy1 0/parenleftbigg 1−ρu ρeue/parenrightbigg dy δ≤y1→∞ (17.3) and the momentum thickness θ≡/integraldisplayy1 0ρu ρeue/parenleftbigg 1−u ue/parenrightbigg dy δ≤y1→∞ (17.10) Bothδ∗andθare related to decrements in the ﬂow due to the presence of the boundary layer; δ∗is proportional to the decrement in mass ﬂow, and θis proportional to the decrement in momentum ﬂow. Moreover, δ∗is the distance away from the body surface through which the outer inviscid ﬂow is displaceddue to the boundary layer. The body shape plus δ ∗deﬁnes a new effective body seen by the inviscid ﬂow. By an order-of-magnitude analysis, the complete Navier-Stokes equations fortwo-dimensional ﬂow reduce to the following boundary-layer equations: Continuity:∂(ρu) ∂x+∂(ρv) ∂y=0 (17.28) x momentum: ρu∂u ∂x+ρv∂u ∂y=−dpe dx+∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μ∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg (17.29) y momentum:∂p ∂y=0 (17.30) (continued )1012 PART 4Viscous Flow Energy:ρu∂h ∂x+ρv∂h ∂y=∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg +udpe dx+μ/parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg2 (17.31) These equations are subject to the boundary conditions: At the wall: y =0u=0v=0h=hw At the boundary-layer edge: y →∞ u→ueh→he Inherent in the above boundary-layer equations are the assumptions that δ/lessmuchc, Re is large, and M∞is not inordinately large.CHAPTER18 Laminar Boundary Layers Lamina—A thin scale or sheet. A layer or coat lying over another. Funk and Wagnalls Standard Desk Dictionary, 1964 PREVIEW BOX Here we get down to the brass tacks of actually solving the boundary-layer equations and obtaining practicalformulas for the calculation of skin friction and aero-dynamic heating to the surface. The solution, however,depends on whether the ﬂow in the boundary layer islaminar or turbulent. And what a big difference thereis! The difference is so important that we have separatechapters for each case—the present chapter dealingwith laminar boundary layers, and Chapter 19 deal-ing with turbulent boundary layers. Laminar boundary layers are easier to deal with, and that is why we treat them ﬁrst. The analysis of alaminar boundary layer is more theoretically “pure”than that for a turbulent boundary layer. You will feelintellectually comfortable with this chapter, so sit backand enjoy this intellectual experience. 18.1 INTRODUCTION Within the panoply of boundary-layer analyses, the solution of laminar boundary layers is well in hand compared to the status for turbulent boundary layers. This chapter is exclusively devoted to laminar boundary layers; turbulent boundarylayers is the subject of Chapter 19. The basic deﬁnitions of laminar and turbulentﬂows are discussed in Section 15.1, and some characteristics of these ﬂows areillustrated in Figures 15.5 and 15.6; it is recommended that you review thatmaterial before progressing further. The road map for this chapter is given in Figure 18.1. We will ﬁrst deal with some well-established classical solutions that come under the heading of 10131014 PART 4Viscous Flow Laminar boundary layer solutions Finite differenceClassical solutions (self-similar solutions) Incompressible flowCompressible flowComputational fluid dynamic solutions Flat plate Stagnation pointReference temperature methodFlat plate Figure 18.1 Road map for Chapter 18. self-similar solutions, a term that is deﬁned in Section 18.2. In this regard, we will deal with both incompressible and compressible ﬂows over a ﬂat plate, as noted onthe left side of our road map in Figure 18.1. We will also discuss the boundary-layersolution in the region surrounding the stagnation point on a blunt-nosed body,because this solution gives us important information on aerodynamic heating atthe stagnation point—vital information for high-speed ﬂight vehicles. As partof the classical solution of compressible boundary layers, we will discuss thereference temperature method—a very useful engineering calculation that makesuse of classical incompressible boundary-layer results to predict skin friction andaerodynamic heating for a compressible ﬂow. Then we will move to the right sideof the road map in Figure 18.1 and discuss some more modern computational ﬂuiddynamic solutions to laminar boundary layers. Unlike the classical self-similarsolutions, which are limited to a few (albeit important) applications such as ﬂatplates and the stagnation region, these CFD numerical solutions deal with thelaminar boundary layer over bodies of arbitrary shapes. Note: As we progress through this chapter, we will encounter ideas and results that are already familiar to us from our discussion of Couette ﬂow in Chapter 16.Indeed, this is one of the primary reasons for Chapter 16—to introduce theseconcepts within the context of a relatively straightforward ﬂow problem beforedealing with the more intricate boundary-layer solutions. 18.2 INCOMPRESSIBLE FLOW OVER A FLAT PLATE: THE BLASIUS SOLUTION Consider the incompressible, two-dimensional ﬂow over a ﬂat plate at 0◦angle of attack, such as sketched in Figure 17.7. For such a ﬂow, ρ=constant, μ= constant, and dpe/dx=0 (because the inviscid ﬂow over a ﬂat plate at α=0 yields a constant pressure over the surface). Moreover, recall that the energyCHAPTER 18 Laminar Boundary Layers 1015 equation is not needed to calculate the velocity ﬁeld for an incompressible ﬂow. Hence, the boundary-layer equations, Equations (17.28) to (17.31), reduce to ∂u ∂x+∂v ∂y=0 (18.1) u∂u ∂x+v∂u ∂y=ν∂2u ∂y2(18.2) ∂p ∂y=0 (18.3) where νis the kinematic viscosity, deﬁned as ν≡μ/ρ. We now embark on a procedure that is common to many boundary-layer solutions. Let us transform the independent variables (x,y)to(ξ, η), where ξ=xandη=y/radicalBigg V∞ νx(18.4) Using the chain rule, we obtain the derivatives ∂ ∂x=∂ ∂ξ∂ξ ∂x+∂ ∂η∂η ∂x(18.5) ∂ ∂y=∂ ∂ξ∂ξ ∂y+∂ ∂η∂η ∂y(18.6) However, from Equations (18.4) we have ∂ξ ∂x=1∂ξ ∂y=0∂η ∂y=/radicalBigg V∞ νx(18.7) (We do not have to explicitly obtain ∂η/∂ xbecause these terms will eventually cancel from our equations.) Substituting Equations (18.7) into (18.5) and (18.6),we have ∂ ∂x=∂ ∂ξ+∂η ∂x∂ ∂η(18.8) ∂ ∂y=/radicalBigg V∞ νx∂ ∂η(18.9) ∂2 ∂y2=V∞ νx∂2 ∂η2(18.10) Also, let us deﬁne a stream function ψsuch that ψ=/radicalbig νxV∞f(η) (18.11) where f(η)is strictly a function of ηonly. This expression for ψidentically satisﬁes the continuity equation, Equation (18.1); therefore, it is a physicallypossible stream function. [Show yourself that ψsatisﬁes Equation (18.1); to do this, you will have to carry out many of the same manipulations described below.]1016 PART 4Viscous Flow From the deﬁnition of the stream function, and using Equations (18.8), (18.9), and (18.11), we have u=∂ψ ∂y=/radicalBigg V∞ νx∂ψ ∂η=V∞f/prime(η) (18.12) v=−∂ψ ∂x=−/parenleftbigg∂ψ ∂ξ+∂η ∂x∂ψ ∂η/parenrightbigg =−1 2/radicalBigg νV∞ xf−/radicalbig νxV∞∂η ∂xf/prime(18.13) Equation (18.12) is of particular note.

Blasius, who obtained it in his Ph.D. dissertation in 1908. Blasius was a student of Prandtl, and his ﬂat-plate solution using Equation (18.15) was the ﬁrst practical applicationof Prandtl’s boundary-layer hypothesis since its announcement in 1904. ExamineEquation (18.15) closely. Amazingly enough it is an ordinary differential equa- tion. Look what has happened! Starting with the partial differential equations fora ﬂat-plate boundary layer given by Equations (18.1) to (18.3), and transform-ingboth the independent and dependent variables through Equations (18.4) and (18.11), we obtain an ordinary differential equation for f(η). In the same breath, we can say that Equation (18.15) is also an equation for the velocity ubecause u=V ∞f/prime(η). Because Equation (18.15) is a single ordinary differential equa- tion, it is simpler to solve than the original boundary-layer equations. However,it is still a nonlinear equation and must be solved numerically, subject to thetransformed boundary conditions, Atη=0: f=0,f /prime=0 Atη→∞ : f/prime=1CHAPTER 18 Laminar Boundary Layers 1017 [Note that at the wall where η=0,f/prime=0 because u=0, and therefore f=0 from Equation (18.13) evaluated at the wall.] Equation (18.15) is a third-order, nonlinear, ordinary differential equation; it can be solved numerically by means of standard techniques, such as the Runge- Kutta method (such as that described in Reference 49). The integration begins atthe wall and is carried out in small increments /Delta1yin the direction of increasing y away from the wall. However, since Equation (18.15) is third order, three bound-ary conditions must be known at η=0; from the above, only two are speciﬁed. A third boundary condition, namely, some value for f /prime/prime(0), must be assumed; Equation (18.15) is then integrated across the boundary layer to a large valueofη. The value of f /primeat large eta is then examined. Does it match the boundary condition at the edge of the boundary layer, namely, is f/prime=1 satisﬁed at the edge of the boundary layer? If not, assume a different value of f/prime/prime(0)and integrate again. Repeat this process until convergence is obtained. This numerical approachis called the “shooting technique”; it is a classical approach, and its basic phi-losophy and details are discussed at great length in Section 16.4. Its applicationto Equation (18.15) is more straightforward than the discussion in Section 16.4,because here we are dealing with an incompressible ﬂow and only one equation,namely, the momentum equation as embodied in Equation (18.15). The solution of Equation (18.15) is plotted in Figure 18.2 in the form of f /prime(η)=u/V∞as a function of η. Note that this curve is the velocity proﬁle and that it is a function of ηonly. Think about this for a moment. Consider two different xstations along the plate, as shown in Figure 18.3. In general, u=u(x,y), and the velocity proﬁles in terms of u=u(y)at given xstations will be different. Clearly, the variation of unormal to the wall will change as the ﬂow progresses downstream. However, when plotted versus η, we see that the proﬁle, u=u(η), is Figure 18.2 Incompressible velocity proﬁle for a ﬂat plate; solution of the Blasius equation.1018 PART 4Viscous Flow yy Velocity profiles u /H11005 u(y) are different at different x stationsu /H11005 u(/H9257) is thesame for all x stations f' /H11005 u/H11408V/H11009/H9257 x Figure 18.3 Velocity proﬁles in physical and transformed space, demonstrating the meaning of self-similar solutions. the same for all x stations, as illustrated in Figure 18.3. This result is an example of a self-similar solution—solutions where the boundary-layer proﬁles, when plotted versus a similarity variable ηare the same for all xstations. For such self- similar solutions, the governing boundary-layer equations reduce to one or more ordinary differential equations in terms of a transformed independent variable.Self-similar solutions occur only for certain special types of ﬂows—the ﬂow overa ﬂat plate is one such example. In general, for the ﬂow over an arbitrary body,the boundary-layer solutions are nonsimilar; the governing partial differentialequations cannot be reduced to ordinary differential equations. Numerical values of f,f /prime, and f/prime/primetabulated versus ηcan be found in Ref- erence 40. Of particular interest is the value of f/prime/primeat the wall; f/prime/prime(0)=0.332. Consider the local skin-friction coefﬁcient deﬁned as cf=τw/1 2ρ∞V2 ∞. From Equation (17.34), the shear stress at the wall is given by τw=μ/parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg y=0(18.16) However, from Equations (18.9) and (18.11), ∂u ∂y=V∞∂f/prime ∂y=V∞/radicalBigg V∞ νx∂f/prime ∂η=V∞/radicalBigg V∞ νxf/prime/prime(18.17) Evaluating Equation (18.17) at the wall, where y=η=0, we obtain /parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg y=0=V∞/radicalBigg V∞ νxf/prime/prime(0) (18.18)CHAPTER 18 Laminar Boundary Layers 1019 Combining Equations (18.16) and (18.18), we have cf=τw 1 2ρ∞V2 ∞=2μ ρ∞V2 ∞V∞/radicalBigg V∞ νxf/prime/prime(0) (18.19) =2/radicalbiggμ ρ∞V∞xf/prime/prime(0)=2f/prime/prime(0)√Rex where Re xis the local Reynolds number. Since f/prime/prime(0)=0.332 from the numerical solution of Equation (18.15), then Equation (18.19) yields cf=0.664√Rex(18.20) which is a classic expression for the local skin-friction coefﬁcient for the in- compressible laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate—a result that stems directly fromboundary-layer theory. Its validity has been amply veriﬁed by experiment. Notethatc f∝Re−1/2 x∝x−1/2; that is, cfdecreases inversely proportional to the square root of distance from the leading edge. Examining the ﬂat plate sketchedin Figure 17.7, the total drag on the top surface of the entire plate is the integratedcontribution of τ w(x)from x=0 to x=c. Letting Cfdenote the skin friction drag coefﬁcient, we obtain from Equation (1.16) Cf=1 c/integraldisplayc 0cfdx (18.21) Substituting Equation (18.20) into (18.21), we obtain Cf=1 c(0.664)/radicalbiggμ ρ∞V∞/integraldisplayc 0x−1/2dx=1.328 c/radicalbiggμc ρ∞V∞ or Cf=1.328√Rec(18.22) where Re cis the Reynolds number based on the total plate length c. An examination of Figure 18.2 shows that f/prime=0.99 at approximately η= 5.0. Hence, the boundary-layer thickness, which was deﬁned earlier as that dis-tance above the surface where u=0.99u e, is η=y/radicalBigg V∞ νx=δ/radicalBigg V∞ νx=5.0 or δ=5.0x√Rex(18.23) Note that the boundary-layer thickness is inversely proportional to the squareroot of the Reynolds number (based on the local distance x). Also, δ∝x 1/2; the1020 PART 4Viscous Flow laminar boundary layer over a ﬂat plate grows parabolically with distance from the leading edge. The displacement thickness δ∗, deﬁned by Equation (17.3), becomes for an incompressible ﬂow δ∗=/integraldisplayy1 0/parenleftbigg 1−u ue/parenrightbigg dy (18.24) In terms of the transformed variables f/primeandηgiven by Equations (18.4) and (18.12), the integral in Equation (18.24) can be written as δ∗=/radicalbiggνx V∞/integraldisplayη1 0[1−f/prime(η)]dη=/radicalbiggνx V∞[η1−f(η1)] (18.25) where η1is an arbitrary point above the boundary layer. The numerical solution for f(η)obtained from Equation (18.15) shows that, amazingly enough, η1−f(η)= 1.72 for all values of ηabove 5.0. Therefore, from Equation (18.25), we have δ∗=1.72/radicalbiggνx V∞ or δ∗=1.72x√Rex(18.26) Note that, as in the case of the boundary-layer thickness itself, δ∗varies inversely with the square root of the Reynolds number, and δ∗∝x1/2. Also, comparing Equations (18.23) and (18.26), we see that δ∗=0.34δ ; the displacement thickness is smaller than the boundary-layer thickness, conﬁrming our earlier statement inSection 17.2. The momentum thickness for an incompressible ﬂow is, from Equa- tion (17.10), θ=/integraldisplayy1 0u ue/parenleftbigg 1−u ue/parenrightbigg dy or in terms of our transformed variables, θ=/radicalbiggνx V∞/integraldisplayη1 0f/prime(1−f/prime)dη (18.27) Equation (18.27) can be integrated numerically from η=0 to any arbitrary point η1>5.0. The result gives θ=/radicalbiggηx V∞(0.664) or θ=0.664 x√Rex(18.28) Note that, as in the case of our previous thicknesses, θvaries inversely with the square root of the Reynolds number and that θ∝x1/2. Also, θ=0.39δ∗, andCHAPTER 18 Laminar Boundary Layers 1021 θ=0.13δ . Another property of momentum thickness can be demonstrated by evaluating θat the trailing edge of the ﬂat plate sketched in Figure 17.7. In this case, x=c, and from Equation (18.28), we obtain θx=c=0.664c√Rec(18.29) Comparing Equations (18.22) and (18.29), we have Cf=2θx=c c(18.30) Equation (18.30) demonstrates that the integrated skin-friction coefﬁcient for the ﬂat plate is directly proportional to the value of θevaluated at the trailing edge. 18.3 COMPRESSIBLE FLOW OVER A FLAT PLATE The properties of the incompressible, laminar, ﬂat-plate boundary layer weredeveloped in Section 18.2. These results hold at low Mach numbers where thedensity is essentially constant through the boundary layer. However, what happensto these properties at high Mach numbers where the density becomes a variable;that is, what are the compressibility effects? The purpose of the present sectionis to outline brieﬂy the effects of compressibility on both the derivations andthe ﬁnal results for laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate. We do not intend to presentmuch detail; rather, we examine some of the salient aspects which distinguishcompressible from incompressible boundary layers. The compressible boundary-layer equations were derived in Section 17.3, and were presented as Equations (17.28) to (17.31). For ﬂow over a ﬂat plate,where dp e/dx=0, these equations become ∂(ρu) ∂x+∂(ρv) ∂y=0 (18.31) ρu∂u ∂x+ρv∂u ∂y=∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μ∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg (18.32) ∂p ∂y=0 (18.33) ρu∂h ∂x+ρv∂h ∂y=∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg +μ/parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg2 (18.34) Compare these equations with those for the incompressible case given by Equa-tions (18.1) to (18.3). Note that, for a compressible boundary layer, (1) the energyequation must be included, (2) the density is treated as a variable, and (3) ingeneral, μandkare functions of temperature and hence also must be treated as variables. As a result, the system of equations for the compressible case, Equa-tions (18.31) to (18.34), is more complex than for the incompressible case, Equa-tions (18.1) to (18.3).1022 PART 4Viscous Flow It is sometimes convenient to deal with total enthalpy, h0=h+V2/2, as the dependent variable in the energy equation, rather than the static enthalpy as given in Equation (18.34). Note that, consistent with the boundary-layer approximation,where vis small, h 0=h+V2/2=h+(u+v2)/2≈h+u2/2. To obtain the energy equation in terms of h0, multiply Equation (18.32) by u, and add to Equation (18.34), as follows. From Equation (18.32) multiplied by u, ρu∂(u2/2) ∂x+ρv∂(u2/2) ∂y=u∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μ∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg (18.35) Adding Equation (18.35) to (18.34), we obtain ρu∂(h+u2/2) ∂x+ρv∂(h+u2/2) ∂y=∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg +μ/parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg2 +u∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μ∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg (18.36) Recall that for a calorically perfect gas, dh=cpdT; hence, ∂T ∂y=1 cp∂h ∂y=1 cp∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg h0−u2 2/parenrightbigg (18.37) Substituting Equation (18.37) into (18.36), we obtain ρu∂h0 ∂x+ρv∂h0 ∂y=∂ ∂y/bracketleftbiggk cp∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg h0−u2 2/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg +μ/parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg2 +u∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μ∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg (18.38) Note that k cp∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg h0−u2 2/parenrightbigg =μk μcp∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg h0−u2 2/parenrightbigg =μ Pr/parenleftbigg∂h0 ∂y−u∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg (18.39) μ/parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg2 +u∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μ∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg =∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg μu∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg (18.40)and Substituting Equations (18.39) and (18.40) into (18.38), we obtain ρu∂h0 ∂x+ρv∂h0 ∂y=∂ ∂y/bracketleftbiggμ Pr∂h0 ∂y+/parenleftbigg 1−1 Pr/parenrightbigg μu∂u ∂y/bracketrightbigg (18.41) which is an alternate form of the boundary-layer energy equation. In this equation, Pr is the local Prandtl number, which, in general, is a function of Tand hence varies throughout the boundary layer. For the laminar, compressible ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, the system of governing equations can now be considered to be Equations (18.31) to (18.33) and (18.41).These are nonlinear partial differential equations. As in the incompressible case,let us seek a self-similar solution; however, the transformed independent variablesCHAPTER 18 Laminar Boundary Layers 1023 must be deﬁned differently: ξ=ρeμeuex ξ=ξ(x) η=ue√2ξ/integraldisplayy 0ρdy η=η(x,y) The dependent variables are transformed as follows: f/prime=u ue(which is consistent with deﬁning stream function ψ=√2ξf) g=h0 (h0)e The mechanics of the transformation using the chain rule are similar to that described in Section 18.2. Hence, without detailing the precise steps (which areleft for your entertainment), Equations (18.32) and (18.41) transform into /parenleftbiggρμ ρeμef/prime/prime/parenrightbigg/prime +ff/prime=0 (18.42) /parenleftbiggρμ ρeμe1 Prg/prime/parenrightbigg/prime +fg/prime+u2 e (h0)e/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg 1−1 Pr/parenrightbiggρμ ρeμef/primef/prime/prime/bracketrightbigg/prime =0 (18.43) and Examine Equations (18.42) and (18.43) closely. They are ordinary differential equations—recall that the primes denote differentiation with respect to η. There- fore, the compressible, laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate does lend itself to a self-similar solution, where f /prime=f/prime(η)andg=g(η). That is, the velocity and total enthalpy proﬁles plotted versus ηare the same at any station. Furthermore, the product ρμis a variable and depends in part on temperature. Hence, Equa- tion (18.42) is coupled to the energy equation, Equation (18.43), via ρμ. Of course, the energy equation is strongly coupled to Equation (18.42) via the ap-pearance of f,f /prime, and f/prime/primein Equation (18.43). Hence, we are dealing with a system of coupled ordinary differential equations which must be solved simultaneously.The boundary conditions for these equations are Atη=0: f=f /prime=0 g=gw Atη→∞ : f/prime=1 g=1 Note that the coefﬁcient u2 e/(h0)eappearing in Equation (18.43) is simply a function of the Mach number: u2e (h0)e=u2e he+u2 e/2=1 he/u2e+1 2=1 cpTe/u2e+1 2=1 RTe/(γ−1)u2e+1 2 =1 1/(γ−1)M2 e+1 2=2(γ−1)M2 e 2+(γ−1)M2 e Therefore, Equation (18.43) involves as a parameter the Mach number of the ﬂow at the outer edge of the boundary layer, that is, for the ﬂat-plate case, the1024 PART 4Viscous Flow freestream Mach number. Hence, we can explicitly see that the compressible boundary-layer solutions will depend on the Mach number. Moreover, because ofthe appearance of the local Pr in Equation (18.43), the solutions will also dependon the freestream Prandtl number as a parameter. Finally, note from the boundaryconditions that the value of gat the wall g wis a given quantity. Note that at the wall where u=0,gw=hw/(h0)e=cpTw/(h0)e. Hence, instead of referring to a given enthalpy at the wall gw, we usually deal with a given wall temperature Tw. An alternative to a given value of Twis the assumption of an adiabatic wall, that is, a case where there is no heat transfer to the wall. If ˙qw=k(∂T/∂y)w=0, then(∂T/∂y)w=0. Hence, for an adiabatic wall, the boundary condition at the wall becomes simply (∂T/∂y)w=0. In short, we see from the above discussion that a numerical self-similar solution can be obtained for the compressible, laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate.However, this solution depends on the Mach number, the Prandtl number, andthe condition of the wall (whether it is adiabatic or a constant temperature wallwith T wgiven). Such numerical solutions have been carried out; see Reference 41 for details. A classic solution to Equations (18.42) and (18.43) is the shootingtechnique described in Section 16.4. The approach here is directly analogous tothat used for the solution of compressible Couette ﬂow discussed in Section 16.4.Since Equation (18.42) is third order, we need three boundary conditions at η=0. We have only two, namely, f=f /prime=0. Therefore, assume a value for f/prime/prime(0), and iterate until the boundary condition at the boundary-layer edge, f/prime=1, is matched. Similarly, Equation (18.43) is a second-order equation. It requirestwo boundary conditions at the wall in order to integrate numerically across theboundary layer; we have only one, namely, g(0)=g w. Thus, assume g/prime(0), and integrate Equation (18.43). Iterate until the outer boundary condition is satisﬁed;that is, g=1. Since Equation (18.42) is coupled to Equation (18.43), that is, since ρμin Equation (18.42) requires a knowledge of the enthalpy (or temperature) proﬁle across the boundary layer, the entire process must be repeated again. Thisis directly analogous to the two minor iterations nested within the major iterationthat was described in the discussion of the shooting method in Section 16.4. Theapproach here is virtually the same philosophy as described in Section 16.4, whichshould be reviewed at this stage. Therefore, no further details will be given here. Typical solutions of Equations (18.42) and (18.43) for the velocity and tem- perature proﬁles through a compressible boundary layer on a ﬂat plate are shownin Figures 18.4–18.7 (Reference 75). Figures 18.4 and 18.5 contain results foran insulated ﬂat plate (zero-heat transfer) using Sutherland’s law for μ, and as- suming a constant Pr =0.75. The velocity proﬁles are shown in Figure 18.4 for different Mach numbers ranging from 0 (incompressible ﬂow) to the large hyper-sonic value of 20. Note that at a given xstation at a given Re x, the boundary-layer thickness increases markedly as Meis increased to hypersonic values. This clearly demonstrates one of the most important aspects of compressible boundary layers,namely, that the boundary-layer thickness becomes large at large Mach numbers.Figure 18.5 illustrates the temperature proﬁles for the same case as Figure 18.4.Note the obvious physical trend that, as M eincreases to large hypersonic values, the temperatures increase markedly. Also note in Figure 18.5 that at the wallCHAPTER 18 Laminar Boundary Layers 1025 04 28 61216 0 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.240 206080 u/ueM/H11009 = 20 y__xRex/H20857 Figure 18.4 Velocity proﬁles in a compressible laminar boundary layer over an insulated ﬂat plate.

(y=0),(∂T/∂y)w=0, as it should be for an insulated surface ( qw=0). Fig- ures 18.6 and 18.7 also contain results by van Driest, but now for the case of heat transfer to the wall. Such a case is called a “cold wall” case, because Tw<Taw. (The opposite case would be a “hot wall,” where heat is transferred from thewall into the ﬂow; in this case, T w>Taw.) For the results shown in Figures 18.6 and 18.7, Tw/Te=0.25 and Pr =0.75=constant.

In addition, the effect of a cold wall on the boundary layer thickness can be seen by comparing Figures 18.4 and 18.6. For example, consider the case of Me=20 in both ﬁgures. For the insulated wall at Mach 20 (Figure 18.4), the boundary layer thickness reaches out beyonda value of (y/x)√ Rex=60, whereas for the cold wall at Mach 20 (Figure 18.6), the boundary-layer thickness is slightly above (y/x)√Rew=30. This illustrates the general fact that the effect of a cold wall is to reduce the boundary-layerthickness. This trend is easily explainable on a physical basis when we exam-ine Figure 18.7, which illustrates the temperature proﬁles through the boundarylayer for the cold-wall case. Comparing Figures 18.5 and 18.7, we note that, asexpected, the temperature levels in the cold-wall case are considerably lower thanin the insulated case. In turn, because the pressure is the same in both cases, wehave from the equation of state p=ρRT, that the density in the cold-wall case is much higher. If the density is higher, the mass ﬂow within the boundary layer canbe accommodated within a smaller boundary-layer thickness; hence, the effect ofa cold wall is to thin the boundary layer. Also note in Figure 18.7 that, starting atthe outer edge of the boundary layer and going toward the wall, the temperatureﬁrst increases, reaches a peak somewhere within the boundary layer, and thendecreases to its prescribed cold-wall value of T w. The peak temperature inside the boundary layer is an indication of the amount of viscous dissipation occurringCHAPTER 18 Laminar Boundary Layers 1027 0481216 0 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.220 103040 u/ueM/H11009 = 20 y__xRex/H20857 Figure 18.6 Velocity proﬁles in a laminar, compressible boundary layer over a cold ﬂat plate.

Figure 18.7 clearly demonstrates the rapidly growing effect of this viscous dissipation as Meincreases—yet another basic aspect of compressible boundary layers. Carefully study the boundary-layer proﬁles shown in Figures 18.4–18.7.

In turn, the surface values cf andCHcan be obtained from the velocity and temperature gradients respectively at the wall as given by the velocity and temperature proﬁles evaluated at the wall.

Sample results are given in Figure 18.8, which shows that the product Cf√Rec decreases as Meincreases. Moreover, the adiabatic wall is warmer than the wall in the case of Tw/Te=1.0. Hence, Figure 18.8 demonstrates that a hot wall also reduces Cf√Rec. Return to Equation (18.23) for the thickness of the incompressible ﬂat-plate boundary layer.

Sample results are given in Figure 18.9, which shows that the product (δ√Rex/x)1030 PART 4Viscous Flow increases as Meincreases. Everything else being equal, boundary layers are thicker at higher Mach numbers. This fact was stated earlier, as shown in Figures 18.4 and 18.6. Note also from Figure 18.9 that a hot wall thickens the boundary layer,as discussed earlier. Recall our discussion of Couette ﬂow in Chapter 16. There, we introduced the concept of the recovery factor rwhere h aw=he+ru2 e 2(18.46) This is a general concept, and can be applied to the boundary-layer solutions here. If we assume a constant Prandtl number for the compressible ﬂat-plate ﬂow, thenumerical solution shows that r=√ Pr (18.47) for the ﬂat plate. Note that Equation (18.47) is analogous to the result given forCouette ﬂow in that the recovery factor is a function of the Prandtl number only. However, for the ﬂat plate, r=√ Pr, whereas for Couette ﬂow, r=Pr. Aerodynamic heating for the ﬂat plate can be treated via Reynolds analogy. The Stanton number and skin friction coefﬁcients are deﬁned respectively as CH=˙qw ρeue(haw−hw)(18.48) cf=τw 1 2ρeu2 e(18.49) and (See our discussion of these coefﬁcients in Chapter 16.) Our results for Couette ﬂow proved that a relation existed between CHandcf—namely, Reynolds anal- ogy, given by Equation (16.59) for Couette ﬂow. Moreover, in this relation, theratio C H/cfwas a function of the Prandtl number only. A directly analogous result holds for the compressible ﬂat-plate ﬂow. If we assume that the Prandtlnumber is constant, then for a ﬂat plate, Reynolds analogy is, from the numericalsolution, CH cf=1 2Pr−2/3(18.50) In Equation (18.50), the local skin friction coefﬁcient cfwhich is given by Equa- tion (18.20) for the incompressible ﬂat-plate case, becomes the following formfor the compressible ﬂat-plate ﬂow: c f=0.664√ ReF/parenleftbigg Me,Pr,Tw Te/parenrightbigg (18.51) In Equation (18.51), Fis the same function as appears in Equation (18.44), and its variation with MeandTw/Teis the same as shown in Figure 18.8.CHAPTER 18 Laminar Boundary Layers 1031 EXAMPLE 18.1 Consider a ﬂat plate at zero angle of attack in an airﬂow at standard sea level conditions (p∞=1.01×105N/m2andT∞=288 K). The chord length of the plate (distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge) is 2 m. The planform area of the plate is40 m At standard sea level conditions, μ∞=1.7894 ×10−5kg/(m)(s). Assume the wall temperature is the adiabatic wall temperature Taw. Calculate the friction drag on the plate when the freestream velocity is (a) 100 m/s, (b ) 1000 m/s. ■Solution (a) The freestream density is ρ∞=p∞ RT∞=1.01×105 (287)(288)=1.22 kg/m3 The speed of sound is a∞=/radicalbig γRT∞=/radicalbig (1.4)(287)(288) =340.2 m/s The Mach number is M∞=100/340.2 =0.29. Hence, M∞is low enough to assume incompressible ﬂow, and we can use Equation (18.22), Cf=1.328√Rec Please note that for the ﬂow over a ﬂat plate at zero angle of attack, the freestream velocityand density, V ∞andρ∞, are the same as the velocity and density at the outer edge of the boundary layer, ueandρe. Hence, these quantities can be used interchangeably. Thus, Rec=ρ∞V∞c μ∞=(1.22)(100)(2) 1.7894 ×10−5=1.36×107 Cf=1.328√Rec=1.328√ 1.36×107=3.60×10−4Hence, The friction drag on one surface of the plate is given by Df=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞SCf=1 2(1.22)(100)2(40)(3.6 ×10−4)=87.8N Thetotal drag due to friction is generated by the shear stress acting on both the top and bottom of the plate. Since Dfabove is the friction drag on only one surface, we have Total friction drag =D=2Df=2(87.8) =175.6 N (b) For V∞=1000 m/s, we have M∞=V∞ a∞=1000 340.2=2.94 Clearly, the ﬂow is compressible, and we have to use Equation (18.44), or more directly, Figure 18.8.

Forexample, from Section 1.5, L= 1 2ρ∞V2 ∞SC L and D=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞SC D As long as CLandCDareindependent of velocity, then clearly L∝V2 ∞and D∝V2 ∞. This is the case for an inviscid, incompressible ﬂow, where CLand CDdepend only on the shape and angle of attack of the body. However, from the dimensional analysis in Section 1.7, we also discovered that CLandCDin general are functions of both Reynolds number and Mach number, CL=f1(Re, M∞) CD=f2(Re, M∞) Of course, for an inviscid, incompressible ﬂow, Re and M∞are not players (in- deed, for inviscid ﬂow, Re →∞ and for incompressible ﬂow, M∞→0). How- ever for all other types of ﬂow, Re and M∞areplayers, and the values of CL andCDdepend not only on the shape and angle of attack of the body, but also on Re and M∞. For this reason, in general the aerodynamic force is notexactly proportional to the square of the velocity. For example, examine the results fromExample 18.1. In part ( a), we calculated a value for drag to the 175.6 N when V ∞=100 m/s. If the drag were proportional to V2 ∞, then in part (b ) where V∞=1000 m/s, a factor of 10 larger, the drag would have been one hundred times larger, or 17,560 N. In contrast, our calculations in part (b ) showed the drag to be considerably smaller, namely 5026 N. In other words, when V∞was increased by a factor of 10, the drag increased by only a factor of 28.6, notbyCHAPTER 18 Laminar Boundary Layers 1033 a factor of 100. The reason is obvious. The value of Cfdecreases when the velocity is increased because: (1) the Reynolds number increases, which from Equation (18.22) causes Cfto decrease, and (2) the Mach number increases, which from Figure 18.8 causes Cfto decrease. So be careful about thinking that aerodynamic force varies with the square of the velocity. For cases other than inviscid, incompressible ﬂow, this is not true. 18.4 THE REFERENCE TEMPERATURE METHOD In this section we discuss an approximate engineering method for predictingskin friction and heat transfer for laminar compressible ﬂow. It is based on thesimple idea of utilizing the formulas obtained from incompressible ﬂow theory,wherein the thermodynamic and transport properties in these formulas are eval-uated at some reference temperature indicative of the temperature somewhereinside the boundary layer. This idea was ﬁrst advanced by Rubesin and Johnsonin Reference 76 and was modiﬁed by Eckert (Reference 77) to include a refer-ence enthalpy. In this fashion, in some sense the classical incompressible for-mulas were “corrected” for compressibility effects. Reference temperature (orreference enthalpy) methods have enjoyed frequent application in engineering-oriented analyses, because of their simplicity. For this reason, we brieﬂy describethe approach here. Consider the incompressible laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, as discussed in Section 18.2. The local skin friction coefﬁcient is given by Equation (18.20),repeated below: c f=0.664√Rex(18.20) For the compressible laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, we write the analogous expression c∗ f=0.664/radicalbigRe∗ x(18.52) except here c∗ fand Re∗ xare evaluated at a reference temperature T∗. That is, Re∗ x=ρ∗uex μ∗ andc∗ f=τw 1 2ρ∗u2 e From Section 18.3, we know that for a compressible boundary layer cfis a function of both MeandTw/Te. Hence, the reference temperature T∗must be a function of MeandTw/Te. This function is T∗ Te=1+0.032 M2 e+0.58/parenleftbiggTw Te−1/parenrightbigg (18.53)1034 PART 4Viscous Flow For heat transfer for the compressible boundary layer, we write Reynolds analogy from Equation (18.50) repeated below. CH cf=1 2Pr−2/3(18.50) Inserting the incompressible formula for cf, Equation (18.20), into Equa- tion (18.50), we have CH=0.332√RexPr−2/3(18.54) Evaluating Equation (18.54) at the reference temperature, we have C∗ H=0.332/radicalbig Re∗ x(Pr∗)−2/3(18.55) where C∗ H=˙qw ρ∗u∗ e(haw−hw) EXAMPLE 18.2 Use the reference temperature method to calculate the friction drag on the same ﬂat plate at the same ﬂow conditions as described in Example 18.1b . Compare the reference temperature results with that obtained in Example 8.1b , which reﬂected the “exact” laminar boundary layer theory. ■Solution The reference temperature is calculated from Equation (18.53), where we need the ratio Tw/Te. For the present case, the ﬂat plate is at the adiabatic wall temperature, hence we need the ratio Taw/Te. To obtain this, we use the recovery factor, which for a ﬂat plate laminar boundary layer is given by Equation (18.47): r=√ Pr where Pr =μcp k For air at standard conditions, Pr =0.71, and it is relatively constant with temperature up to about 800 K. Hence, we assume Pr =Pr∗=0.71, and r=√ Pr=√ 0.71=0.843 The recovery factor is deﬁned by Equation (16.49) as r=Taw−Te T0−Te(16.49) or Taw=Te+r(T0−Te) orTaw Te=1+r/parenleftbiggT0 Te−1/parenrightbigg (18.56)CHAPTER 18 Laminar Boundary Layers 1035 From Appendix A, for Me=2.94,T0 Te=2.74. Hence, Equation (18.56) yields Taw Te=1+r/parenleftbiggT0 Te−1/parenrightbigg =1+0.843(2.74 −1)=2.467 From Equation (18.53), T∗ Te=1+0.032 M2 e+0.58/parenleftbiggTaw Te−1/parenrightbigg =1+0.032(2.94)2+0.58(2.467 −1)=2.1275 Thus, T∗=2.1275 Te=2.1275(288) =612.7K From the equation of state, the value of ρ∗that corresponds to T∗is ρ∗=p∗ RT∗=1.01×105 (287)(612.7)=0.574 kg/m3 Also, the value of μ∗that corresponds to T∗is obtained from Sutherland’s law, given by Equation (15.3) μ μ0=/parenleftbiggT T0/parenrightbigg3/2T0+110 T+110(15.3) Recall: In Equation (15.3), μ0is the reference viscosity coefﬁcient at the reference temper- ature T0. In Equation (15.3) T0denotes the reference temperature, not the total temperature. Here we have a case of the same notation for two different quantities, but the meaning of T0in Equation (15.3) is clear from its context. We will use the standard sea level conditions for the values of T0andμ0, that is, μ0=1.7894 ×10−5kg/(m)(s) and T0=288 K Hence, from Equation (15.3) μ∗ μ0=/parenleftbiggT∗ T0/parenrightbigg3/2T0+110 T∗+110=/parenleftbigg612.7 288/parenrightbigg3/2288+110 612.7+110=1.709 or μ∗=1.709μ 0=(1.709)(1.7894 ×10−5)=3.058×10−5kg/(m)(s) Thus, Re∗ c=ρ∗uec μ∗=(0.574)(1000)(2) 3.058×10−5=3.754×107 From Equation (18.52) integrated over the entire chord of the plate, we have the same form as Equation (18.22), namely, C∗ f=1.328/radicalbig Re∗ c(18.57) Thus,C∗ f=1.328/radicalbig Re∗c=1.328√ 3.754×107=2.167×10−4 Hence, the friction drag on one side of the plate is Df=1 2ρ∗V2 ∞SC∗ f=1 2(0.574)(1000)2(40)(2.167 ×10−4)=2488 N1036 PART 4Viscous Flow The total friction drag taking into account both the top and bottom surfaces of the plate is D=2(2488) =4976 N The result obtained from classical compressible boundary layer theory in Example 18.1 b isD=5026 N. The result from the reference temperature method used here is within one percent of the “exact” value found in Example 18.1b , a stunning example of the accuracy of the reference temperature method, at least for the case treated here. 18.4.1 Recent Advances: The Meador-Smart Reference Temperature Method The reference temperature method discussed in Section 18.4 is a concept that dates back to the late 1940s, but it is still a work in progress. Very recently, Meador andSmart (William E. Meador and Michael K. Smart, “Reference Enthalpy MethodDeveloped from Solutions of the Boundary-Layer Equations,” AIAA Journal, vol. 43, no. 1, January 2005, pp. 135–139) published improved formulas for thecalculation of the reference temperature, one for laminar ﬂow and another forturbulent ﬂow. This result for a laminar ﬂow is T ∗ Te=0.45+0.55Tw Te+0.16 r/parenleftbiggγ−1 2/parenrightbigg M2 e where ris the recovery factor for laminar ﬂow, r=√ Pr∗. EXAMPLE 18.3 Repeat Example 18.2, using the Meador-Smart equation for the reference temperature. ■Solution Assuming the Prandtl number is reasonably constant, r=√ Pr∗=√ Pr=√ 0.71=0.843 Also, because the ﬂat plate is at the adiabatic wall temperature, from Example 8.2, Tw Te=Taw Te=2.467 So the Meador-Smart equation becomes T∗ Te=0.45+0.55(2.467) +0.16(0.843)(0.2) M2 e orT∗ Te=1.807+0.027 M2 e ForMe=2.94, we have T∗ Te=1.807+0.027(2.94)2=2.04 T∗=2.04 Te=2.04(288) =587.5KCHAPTER 18 Laminar Boundary Layers 1037 ρ∗=p∗ RT∗=1.01×105 (287)(587.5)=0.599 kg/m3 μ∗ μ0=/parenleftbiggT∗ T0/parenrightbigg3/2T0+110 T∗+110=/parenleftbigg587.5 288/parenrightbigg3/2288+110 587.5+110=1.664 μ∗=1.664μ0=1.664(1.7894 ×10−5)=2.978×10−5 Re∗ c=ρ∗uec μ∗=(0.500)(1000)(2) 2.978×10−5=4.02×107 C∗ f=1.328/radicalbig Re∗ c=1.328√ 4.02×107=2.09×104 Df=1 2ρ∗V2 ∞SC∗ f=1 2(0.599)(1000)2(40)(2.09 ×10−4)=2504 N D=2(2504) =5008 N The result from Example 18.2 is D=4976 N, and the exact result from Example 18.1 is 5026 N. The Meador-Smith method is more accurate than Equation (18.53); it agrees to within 0.4 percent of the exact amount. 18.5 STAGNATION POINT AERODYNAMIC HEATING Contrary to what you might think, even though the ﬂow velocity is zero at a stag- nation point, the boundary layer at the stagnation point can be deﬁned and has aﬁnite thickness. The ﬂow conditions at the edge of the stagnation point boundarylayer are given by the inviscid solution for a stagnation point; in particular, at theboundary-layer edge, the velocity is zero and the temperature is the total tem-perature, that is, u e=0 and Te=T0. This is shown in Figure 18.10. Moreover, along the vertical line in the η-direction shown in Figure 18.10, u=0 at every point inside the boundary layer. However, the ratio (u/ue)=(0/0) is an indeter- minant form that has a ﬁnite value at each point in the boundary layer. As in thecase of the ﬂat plate solutions discussed in Sections 18.2 and 18.3, we deﬁne afunction f(η)such that (u/u e)=f/prime(η), and f/primehas a deﬁnite proﬁle through the boundary layer. Indeed, we can deﬁne the edge of the boundary layer as the pointwhere (u/u e)=f/prime(η)=0.99. Finally, we note that the shear stress at the wall at the stagnation point (point Ain Figure 18.10) is zero. This not only comes out of the solution of the boundary layer equations, but it is obvious by inspection.Along the wall above point Athe shear stress acts upward, and below point Ait acts downward. Hence right at point Athe shear stress must go through zero. If the above discussion sounds rather theoretical, the temperature proﬁle through the stagnation point boundary layer is easier to visualize. The temperatureat the outer edge is the total temperature T The temperature at the wall at η=0 isTw. Hence, there is a temperature proﬁle that exists in the normal direction through the stagnation point boundary layer. The heat transfer at the stagnation1038 PART 4Viscous Flow q• wEdge ofboundary layerWallTwr u = 0 ATe = T oue = 0 /H9257 _uue= f/H11032(/H9257): a finite value Figure 18.10 Schematic of the stagnation region boundary layer. point is given by the temperature gradient at point A, namely, ˙qw=/bracketleftbigg −k/parenleftbigg∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg w/bracketrightbigg A(18.58) The practical purpose of a stagnation point boundary-layer solution is to calculate the heat transfer, ˙qw. The boundary-layer equations, Equation (17.28)–(17.31), applied at the stag- nation point region are transformed using a version of the transformation describedin Section 18.3, namely, ξ=/integraldisplayx 0ρeμeurdx (18.59) η=ue√2ξ/integraldisplayy 0ρdy (18.60) f/prime(η)=u ue(18.61) g(η)=h he(18.62) where his the static enthalpy (since u=0, the static and total enthalpies are the same). This leads to the stagnation point boundary layer equations givenCHAPTER 18 Laminar Boundary Layers 1039 below. For a detailed derivation of these equations, see, for example, Chapter 6 of Reference 52. (Cf/prime/prime)/prime+ff/prime/prime=(f/prime)2−g (18.63) /parenleftbiggC Prg/prime/parenrightbigg/prime +fg/prime=0 (18.64) where C=(ρμ/ρ eμe). Equations (18.63) and (18.64) are the governing equa- tions for a compressible, stagnation-point boundary layer. Examining these equa-tions, we see no ξ-dependency. Hence, the stagnation point boundary layer is a self-similar case. Numerical solutions to Equations (18.63) and (18.64) can be obtained by the “shooting technique” as described earlier in the ﬂat-plate case. There is nothingto be gained in going through the details at this stage of our discussion. Instead,we simply state the result of solving Equations (18.63) and (18.64), correlated inthe following expression obtained from Reference 78: Cylinder: ˙q w=0.57 Pr−0.6(ρeμe)1/2/radicalBigg due dx(haw−hw) (18.65) If we had considered an axisymmetric body, the original transformation given by Equations (18.59) and (18.60) would have been slightly modiﬁed as follows: ξ=/integraldisplayx 0ρeueμer2dx (18.66) and η=uer√2ξ/integraldisplayy 0ρdy (18.67) where ris the vertical coordinate measured from the centerline, as shown in Fig- ure 18.10. Equations (18.66) and (18.67) lead to equations for the axisymmetricstagnation point almost identical to Equation (18.63) and (18.64), namely, (Cf /prime/prime)/prime+ff/prime/prime=1 2[(f/prime)2−g] (18.68) and/parenleftbiggC Prg/prime/parenrightbigg/prime +fg/prime=0 (18.69) where C=(ρμ/ρ eμe). In turn, the resulting heat transfer expression is (Refer- ence 78): Sphere: ˙qw=0.763 Pr−0.65(ρeμe)/radicalBigg due dx(haw−hw) (18.70) Compare Equation (18.65) for the two-dimensional cylinder with Equa- tion (18.70) for the axisymmetric sphere. The equations are the same exceptfor the leading coefﬁcient, which is higher for the sphere. Everything else beingthe same, this demonstrates that stagnation point heating to a sphere is larger1040 PART 4Viscous Flow than to a two-dimensional cylinder. Why? The answer lies in a basic difference between two- and three-dimensional ﬂows. In a two-dimensional ﬂow, the gas hasonly two directions to move when it encounters a body—up or down. In contrast,in an axisymmetric ﬂow, the gas has three directions to move—up, down, andsideways—and hence the ﬂow is somewhat “relieved,” that is, in comparing two-and three-dimensional ﬂows over bodies with the same longitudinal section (suchas a cylinder and a sphere), there is a well-known three-dimensional relieving ef-fect for the three-dimensional ﬂow. As a consequence of this relieving effect, theboundary-layer thickness δat the stagnation point is smaller for the sphere than for the cylinder. In turn, the temperature gradient at the wall, (∂T/∂y) w, which is of the order of (Te/δ), is larger for the sphere. Since ˙qw=k(∂T/∂y)w, then ˙qw is larger for the sphere. This conﬁrms the comparison between Equations (18.65)and (18.70). The above results for aerodynamic heating to a stagnation point have a stun- ning impact on hypersonic vehicle design, namely, they impose the requirementfor the vehicle to have a blunt, rather than a sharp, nose. To see this, considerthe velocity gradient, du e/dx, which appears in Equations (18.65) and (18.70). From Euler’s equation applied at the edge of the boundary layer dpe=−ρeuedue (18.71) due dx=−1 ρeuedpe dx(18.72) we have Assuming a newtonian pressure distribution over the surface, we have from Equation (14.4) Cp=2 sin2θ where θis deﬁned as the angle between a tangent to the surface and the freestream direction. If we deﬁne φas the angle between the normal to the surface and the freestream, then Equation (14.4) can be written as Cp=2 cos2φ (18.73) From the deﬁnition of Cp, Equation (18.73) becomes pe−p∞ q∞=2 cos2φ or pe=2q∞cos2φ+p∞ (18.74) Differentiating Equation (18.74), we obtain dpe dx=−4q∞cosφsinφdφ dx(18.75) Combining Equations (18.72) and (18.75), we have due dx=4q∞ ρeuecosφsinφdφ dx(18.76)CHAPTER 18 Laminar Boundary Layers 1041 M/H11009 R/H9004x /H9004/H9278/H9278x r ue /H9254 Figure 18.11 Geometry of the stagnation region.

We see that ˙qw∝1√ R(18.83) This states that stagnation-point heating varies inversely with the square root of the nose radius; hence, to reduce the heating, increase the nose radius. Thisis the reason why the nose and leading edge regions of hypersonic vehicles areblunt; otherwise, the severe aerothermal conditions in the stagnation region wouldquickly melt a sharp leading edge. Return to Section 1.1 and review our qualitative discussion contrasting the aerodynamic heating for slender and blunt reentry vehicles. There we argued ona qualitative basis that to minimize aerodynamic heating a blunt nose must beused. We have now quantitatively proven this fact with the derivation of Equa-tion (18.83). The fact that ˙q wis inversely proportional to√ Ris experimentally veriﬁed in Figure 18.12. Here, various sets of experimental data for CHat the stagnation point are plotted versus Reynolds number based on nose diameter; the abscissa isessentially proportional to R. This is a log-log plot, and the data exhibit a slope of−0.5, hence verifying that ˙q w∝1/√ R. 10 Re2rRe2rrCH q• s, CH1.0 0.1100 600 2Experiments Boylan (AEDC) Ferri ZakkayKoppenwallner (DFVLR)M /H11009 21 821 M /H11009 Figure 18.12 Stagnation point Stanton number versus Re based on nose radius.

In this section we discuss a ﬁnite-difference technique for solvingthe general boundary layer equations; such ﬁnite-difference solutions representthe current state of the art in the analysis of boundary layers. Let us set the perspective for our discussion. Equations (17.28)–(17.31) are the general boundary layer equations. For the special case of the ﬂat plate, theseequations reduced to Equations (18.42) and (18.43), and for the stagnation re-gion they reduced to Equations (18.63) and (18.64). In both special cases, theseequations in terms of the transformed dependent and independent variables led toself-similar solutions (ﬂow variations only in the transformed ηdirection). For the general case of an arbitrary body, it is still useful to transform the full boundary-layer equations, Equations (17.28)–(17.31), via the transformation given by Equa-tions (18.59)–(18.62). For a detailed derivation of these transformed equations,see Chapter 6 of Reference 52. The resulting form of the equation is: x momentum: (Cf/prime/prime)/prime+ff/prime/prime=2ξ ue/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg (f/prime)2−ρe ρ/parenrightbiggdue dξ+2ξ/parenleftbigg f/prime∂f/prime ∂ξ−∂f ∂ξf/prime/prime/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (18.84) y momentum:∂p ∂η=0 (18.85) Energy: /parenleftbiggC Prg/prime/parenrightbigg/prime +fg/prime=2ξ/bracketleftbigg f/prime∂g ∂ξ+f/primeg he∂he ∂ξ−g/prime∂f ∂ξ+ρeue ρhef/primedue dξ/bracketrightbigg −Cu2 e he(f/prime/prime)2 (18.86) where as before C=ρμ/ρ eμe,f/prime=u/ue, and g=h/he. In Equations (18.84)– (18.86), the prime denotes the partial derivative with respect to η, that is, f/prime≡ ∂f/∂η. Equations (18.84)–(18.86) are simply the transformed versions of Equa- tions (17.28)–(17.31), with no loss of authority. Examine Equations (18.84)–(18.86); they are the transformed compressible boundary layer equations. They are still partial differential equations, where both fandgare functions of ξandη. They contain no further approxima- tions or assumptions beyond those associated with the original boundary-layer equations. However, they are certainly in a less recognizable, somewhat more1044 PART 4Viscous Flow complicated-looking form than the original equations. However, do not be dis- turbed by this; in reality Equations (18.84)–(18.86) are in a form that proves tobe practical and useful. The above transformed boundary-layer equations must be solved subject to the following boundary conditions. The physical boundary conditions weregiven immediately following Equations (17.28)–(17.31); the corresponding trans-formed boundary conditions are: At the wall: η=0f=f /prime=0g=gw (ﬁxed wall temperature) or g/prime=0 (adiabatic wall) At the boundary-layer edge: η→∞ f/prime=1g=1 In general, solutions of Equations (18.84), (18.85), and (18.86) along with the appropriate boundary conditions yield variations of velocity and enthalpy throughout the boundary layer, via u=uef/prime(ξ, η) andh=heg(ξ, η). The pressure throughout the boundary layer is known, because the known pressuredistribution (or equivalently the known velocity distribution) at the edge of theboundary is given by p e=pe(ξ), and this pressure is impressed without change through the boundary layer in the locally normal direction via Equation (18.85),which says that p=constant in the normal direction at any ξlocation. Finally, knowing hand pthroughout the boundary layer, equilibrium thermodynamics provides the remaining variables through the appropriate equations of state, forexample, T=T(h,p),ρ=ρ(h,p), etc. 18.6.1 Finite-Difference Method Return for a moment to Section 2.17.2 where we introduced some ideas from com-putation ﬂuid dynamics, and especially review the ﬁnite-difference expressionsderived there. Recall that we can simulate the partial derivatives with forward,rearward, or central differences. We will use these concepts in the followingdiscussion. Also consider Figure 18.13, which shows a schematic of a ﬁnite-difference grid inside the boundary layer. The grid is shown in the physical x-yspace, where it is curvilinear and unequally spaced. However, in the ξ-ηspace, where the calculations are made, the grid takes the form of a rectangular grid withuniform spacing /Delta1ξand/Delta1η. In Figure 18.13, the portion of the grid at four different ξ(orx) stations is shown, namely, at (i−2),(i−1),i, and(i+1). Consider again the general, transformed boundary-layer equations given by Equations (18.84) and (18.86). Assume that we wish to calculate the boundarylayer at station (i+1)in Figure 18.13. As discussed in Section 2.17.2, the general philosophy of ﬁnite-difference approaches is to evaluate the governingpartial differential equations at a given grid point by replacing the derivativesby ﬁnite-difference quotients at that point. Consider, for example, the grid point(i,j)in Figure 18.13. At this point, replace the derivatives in Equations (18.84)CHAPTER 18 Laminar Boundary Layers 1045 123 Stations(i + 1)(i, j – 1)(i, j + 1) (i, j) (i – 1, j – 1)(i – 1, j + 1)(i + 1 , j + 1) (i + 1 , j – 1)(i + 1 , j) (i – 1, j) (i – 2, j – 1)(i – 2, j + 1) (i – 2, j)Edge of boundary layerx, /H9264 (i – 2)(i – 1)(i) Figure 18.13 Schematic for ﬁnite-difference solution of the boundary layer. and (18.86) by ﬁnite-difference expressions of the form: ∂f ∂ξ=fi+1,j−fi,j /Delta1ξ(18.87) ∂f ∂η=θ(fi+1,j+1−fi+1,j−1) 2/Delta1η+(1−θ)(fi,j+1−fi,j−1) 2/Delta1η(18.88) ∂2f ∂η2=θ(fi+1,j+1−2fi+1,j+fi+1,j−1) (/Delta1η)2+(1−θ)(fi,j+1−2fi,j+fi,j−1) (/Delta1η)2 (18.89) f=θfi+1,j+(1−θ)fi,j (18.90) where θis a parameter which adjusts Equations (18.87)–(18.90) to various ﬁnite- difference approaches (to be discussed below). Similar relations for the derivatives ofgare employed. When Equations (18.87)–(18.90) are inserted into Equa- tions (18.84) and (18.86), along with the analogous expressions for g, two alge- braic equations are obtained. If θ=0, the only unknowns that appear are fi+1,j andgi+1,j, which can be obtained directly from the two algebraic equations. This is an explicit approach. Using this approach, the boundary-layer properties at gridpoint(i+1,j)are solved explicitly in terms of the known properties at points (i,j+1),(i,j), and (i,j−1). The boundary-layer solution is a downstream marching procedure; we are calculating the boundary-layer proﬁles at station(i+1)only after the ﬂow at the previous station (i)has been obtained.1046 PART 4Viscous Flow When 0 <θ≤1, then fi+1,j+1,fi+1,j,fi+1,j−1,gi+1,j+1,gi+1,j, and gi+1,j−1 appear as unknowns in Equations (18.84) and (18.86). We have six unknowns and only two equations. Therefore, the ﬁnite-difference forms of Equations (18.84)and (18.86) must be evaluated at all the grid points through the boundary layer atstation (i+1)simultaneously, leading to an implicit formulation of the unknowns. In particular, if θ= 1 2, the scheme becomes the well-known Crank-Nicolson implicit procedure, and if θ=1, the scheme is called “fully implicit.” These implicit schemes result in large systems of simultaneous algebraic equations, thecoefﬁcients of which constitute block tridiagonal matrices. Already the reader can sense that implicit solutions are more elaborate than explicit solutions. Indeed, we remind ourselves that the subject of this book isthe fundamentals of aerodynamics, and it is beyond our scope to go into greatcomputational ﬂuid dynamic detail. Therefore, we will not elaborate any further.Our purpose here is only to give the ﬂavor of the ﬁnite-difference approach toboundary-layer solutions. For more information on explicit and implicit ﬁnite-difference methods, see the author’s book Computational Fluid Dynamics: The Basics with Applications (Reference 60). In summary, a ﬁnite-difference solution of a general, nonsimilar boundary- layer proceeds as follows: 1.The solution must be started from a given solution at the leading edge, or at a stagnation point (say station 1 in Figure 18.13). This can be obtained fromappropriate self-similar solutions. 2.At station 2, the next downstream station, the ﬁnite-difference procedurereﬂected by Equations (18.87)–(18.90) yields a solution of the ﬂow-ﬁeldvariables across the boundary layer. 3.Once the boundary-layer proﬁles of uandTare obtained, the skin friction and heat transfer at the wall are determined from τ= /bracketleftbigg μ/parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg w and ˙q=/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg w Here, the velocity gradients can be obtained from the known proﬁles of u andTby using one-sided differences (see Reference 60), such as /parenleftbigg∂u ∂y/parenrightbigg w=−3u 1+4u2−u3 2/Delta1y(18.91) /parenleftbigg∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg w=−3T1+4T2−T3 2/Delta1y(18.92) In Equations (18.91) and (18.92), the subscripts 1, 2, and 3 denote the wallpoint and the next two adjacent grid points above the wall. Of course, due tothe speciﬁed boundary conditions of no velocity slip and a ﬁxed walltemperature, u 1=0 and T1=Twin Equations (18.91) and (18.92).CHAPTER 18 Laminar Boundary Layers 1047 4.The above steps are repeated for the next downstream location, say station 3 in Figure 18.13. In this fashion, by repeating applications of these steps, thecomplete boundary layer is computed, marching downstream from a giveninitial solution. An example of results obtained from such ﬁnite-difference boundary-layer solutions is given in Figures 18.14 and 18.15 obtained by Blottner (Reference 80).

At these conditions, the boundary layer will involve dissociation, and such chemicalreactions were included in the calculations of Reference 80. Chemically react-ing boundary layers are not the purview of this book; however, some results ofReference 80 are presented here just to illustrate the ﬁnite-difference method.For example, Figure 18.14 gives the calculated velocity and temperature proﬁlesas a station located at x/R N=50, where RNis the nose radius. The local val- ues of velocity and temperature at the boundary layer edge are also quoted inFigure 18.14. Considering the surface properties, the variations of C Handcfas functions of distance from the stagnation point are shown in Figure 18.15. Notethe following physical trends illustrated in Figure 18.15. 1.The shear stress is zero at the stagnation point (as is always the case), then it increases around the nose, reaches a maximum, and decreases furtherdownstream. 2.The values of C Hare relatively constant near the nose, and then decrease further downstream. 3.Reynolds analogy can be written as CH=cf 2s(18.93) where sis called the “Reynolds analogy factor.” For the ﬂat-plate case, we see from Equation (18.50) that s=Pr2/3. However, clearly from the results of Figure 18.15 we see that sis a variable in the nose region because CH is relatively constant while cfis rapidly increasing. In contrast, for theCHAPTER 18 Laminar Boundary Layers 1049 downstream region, cfandCHare essentially equal, and we can state that Reynolds analogy becomes approximately CH/cf=1. The point here is that Reynolds analogy is greatly affected by strong pressure gradients in the ﬂow, and hence loses its usefulness as an engineering tool in such cases,at least when C Handcfare based on freestream quantities as shown in Figure 18.15. 18.7 SUMMARY This brings to an end our discussion of laminar boundary layers. Return to theroad map in Figure 18.1 and remind yourself of the territory we have covered.Some of the important results are summarized below. For incompressible laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, the boundary-layer equationsreduce to the Blasius equation 2f /prime/prime/prime+ff/prime/prime=0 (18.15) where f/prime=u/ue. This produces a self-similar solution where f/prime=f/prime(η), independent of any particular xstation along the surface. A numerical solution of Equation (17.48) yields numbers which lead to the following results.

Peter BradshawImperial College of Science andTechnology, London 1978 Turbulence was, and still is, one of the great unsolved mysteries of science, andit intrigued some of the best scientiﬁc minds of the day. Arnold Sommerfeld,the noted German theoretical physicist of the 1920s, once told me, for instance,that before he died he would like to understand two phenomena—quantummechanics and turbulence. Sommerfeld died in 1924. I believe he was somewhatnearer to an understanding of the quantum, the discovery that led to modernphysics, but no closer to the meaning of turbulence. Theodore von Karman, 1967 PREVIEW BOX Nature, when left to herself, always goes to the state of maximum disorder. This is particularly true forboundary-layer ﬂows under real conditions. For mostpractical applications in aerodynamics, the ﬂow inboundary layers is predominantly turbulent—naturegoing to the state of maximum disorder. Turbulentboundary layers can be bad news; for the same ex-ternal ﬂow conditions, the turbulent skin friction andaerodynamic heating is larger, frequently much larger, than laminar skin friction and aerodynamic heating.But turbulent boundary layers can also be good newsbecause they remain attached to a surface for muchlarger distances downstream than a laminar boundarylayer under the same external ﬂow conditions. Hence,pressure drag due to ﬂow separation is usually smallerfor bodies with turbulent boundary layers comparedto those with laminar boundary layers. Turbulent boundary layers are the subject of this chapter. There are no stand-alone theoretical resultsfor turbulent boundary layers—any analysis mustincorporate empirical data in some form. So we willnot beat around the bush. We go directly to empirically 10511052 PART 4Viscous Flow based formulas that allow the estimation (and it is truly only an estimation) of turbulent boundary-layerthickness and skin friction. There are many differentapproaches to the calculation of turbulent ﬂows, allrequiring some input from experimental data. Wholebooks have been written on the subject of turbulentﬂow. The objective of this very short chapter is sim-ply to give you some ability to compute turbulentboundary-layer results, albeit imprecisely. Hang on,and enjoy this short ride. 19.1 INTRODUCTION The subject of turbulent ﬂow is deep, extensively studied, but at the time of writing still imprecise. The basic nature of turbulence, and therefore our ability topredict its characteristics, is still an unsolved problem in classical physics. Manybooks have been written on turbulent ﬂows, and many people have spent theirprofessional lives working on the subject. As a result, it is presumptuous for us totry to carry out a thorough discussion of turbulent boundary layers in this chapter.Instead, the purpose of this chapter is simply to provide a contrast with our studyof laminar boundary layers in Chapter 18. Here, we will only be able to provide aﬂavor of turbulent boundary layers, but this is all that is necessary in the presentbook. Turbulence is a subject that we leave for you to study more extensively asa subject on its own. Before proceeding further, return to Section 15.2 and review the basic dis- cussion of the nature of turbulence that is given there. In the present chapter, wewill pick up where Section 15.2 leaves off. Also, we note that no pure theory of turbulent ﬂow exists. Every analysis of turbulent ﬂow requires some type of empirical data in order to obtain a practi- cal answer. As we examine the calculation of turbulent boundary layers in thefollowing sections, the impact of this statement will become blatantly obvious.Finally, because this chapter is short, there is no need for a road map to act as aguide. 19.2 RESULTS FOR TURBULENT BOUNDARY LAYERS ON A FLAT PLATE In this section, we discuss a few results for the turbulent boundary layer ona ﬂat plate, both incompressible and compressible, simply to provide a basisof comparison with the laminar results described in the previous section. Forconsiderably more detail on the subject of turbulent boundary layers, consultReferences 40 to 42. For incompressible ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, the boundary-layer thickness is given approximately by δ=0.37x Re1/5 x(19.1)CHAPTER 19 Turbulent Boundary Layers 1053 Note from Equation (19.1) that the turbulent boundary-layer thickness varies approximately as Re−1/5 xin contrast to Re−1/2 xfor a laminar boundary layer. Also, turbulent values of δgrow more rapidly with distance along the surface; δ∝x4/5 for a turbulent ﬂow in contrast to δ∝x1/2for a laminar ﬂow. With regard to skin-friction drag, for incompressible turbulent ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, we have Cf=0.074 Re1/5 c(19.2) Note that for turbulent ﬂow, Cfvaries as Re−1/5cin comparison with the Re−1/2c variation for laminar ﬂow. Hence, Equation (19.2) yields larger friction drag coef- ﬁcients for turbulent ﬂow in comparison with Equation (18.22) for laminar ﬂow. The effects of compressibility on Equation (19.2) are shown in Figure 19.1, where Cfis plotted versus Re ∞with M∞as a parameter. The turbulent ﬂow re- sults are shown toward the right of Figure 19.1, at the higher values of Reynoldsnumbers where turbulent conditions are expected to occur, and laminar ﬂow re-sults are shown toward the left of the ﬁgure, at lower values of Reynolds numbers.This type of ﬁgure—friction drag coefﬁcient for both laminar and turbulent ﬂowas a function of Re on a log-log plot—is a classic picture, and it allows a readycontrast of the two types of ﬂow. From this ﬁgure, we can see that, for the same Figure 19.1 Turbulent friction drag coefﬁcient for a ﬂat plate as a function of Reynolds and Mach numbers. Adiabatic wall Pr =0.75. For contrast, some laminar results are shown. (Data are from the calculations of Van Driest, E. R.: “Turbulent Boundary Layer in Compressible Fluids,” J. Aeronaut. Sci., vol. 18, no. 3, March 1951, p. 145).1054 PART 4Viscous Flow Re∞, turbulent skin friction is higher than laminar; also, the slopes of the turbulent curves are smaller than the slopes of the laminar curves—a graphic comparison of the Re−1/5variation in contrast to the laminar Re−1/2variation. Note that the effect of increasing M∞is to reduce Cfat constant Re and that this effect is stronger on the turbulent ﬂow results. Indeed, Cffor the turbulent results decreases by almost an order of magnitude (at the higher values of Re ∞) when M∞is increased from 0 to 10. For the laminar ﬂow, the decrease in CfasM∞is increased though the same Mach number range is far less pronounced. 19.2.1 Reference Temperature Method for Turbulent Flow The reference temperature method discussed in Section 18.4 for laminar boundarylayers can be applied to turbulent boundary layers as well. With the referencetemperature T ∗given by Equation (18.53), the incompressible turbulent ﬂat plate result for Cfgiven by Equation (19.2) can be modiﬁed for compressible turbulent ﬂow as C∗ f=0.074 (Re∗ c)1/5(19.3) where C∗ f=Df 1 2ρ∗u2 eS(19.4) EXAMPLE 19.1 Consider the same ﬂat plate under the same external ﬂow conditions given in Example 18.1. Calculate the friction drag on the plate assuming a turbulent boundary layer for a freestream velocity of (a)100 m/s, and (b)1000 m/s. ■Solution (a)From Example 18.1 a, Re c=1.36×107. Hence, from Equation (19.2) Cf=0.074 (Re c)1/5=0.074 (1.36×107)1/5=0.074 26.71=2.77×10−3 Also from Example 18.1, we have ρ∞=1.22 kg/m3andS=40 m2. Hence, for one side of the plate, Df=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞SCf=1 2(1.22)(100)2(40)(2.77 ×10−3)=675.9N The total friction drag taking into account both sides of the plate is D=2Df=2(675.9) =1352 N Comparing this result for turbulent ﬂow with the laminar result in Example 1.81 a, we have Dturbulent Dlaminar=1352 175.6=7.7CHAPTER 19 Turbulent Boundary Layers 1055 Turbulent ﬂow causes a factor of 7.7 increase in friction drag compared to the laminar ﬂow. You can easily see why the understanding of, and prediction of, turbulent ﬂow, especially the prediction of when the ﬂow will transist from laminar to turbulent ﬂow, is so important. (b)ForV∞=1000 m/s, from Example 18.1b , Re c=1.36×108, and M∞=2.94. From Figure 19.1, we have Cf=1.34×10−3 Hence, Df=1 2ρ∞V2 ∞SCf=1 2(1.22)(1000)2(40)(1.34 ×10−3)=32,700 N. The total friction drag is D=2(32,700) =65,400 N Again, comparing this result with that from Example 18.1b , we have Dturbulent Dlaminar=65,400 5026=13 Note that, at the higher Mach number of 2.92, turbulence increased the drag by a factor of13, whereas for the incompressible case, the increase was 7.7, a smaller amount. The differ-ence between the drag for laminar and turbulent ﬂow is more pronounced at higher speeds. EXAMPLE 19.2 Repeat Example 19.1b , except using the reference temperature method. Assume the plate has an adiabatic wall. ■Solution We draw on the results calculated in Example 18.2. The recovery factor for a turbulentﬂow is slightly different than that for a laminar ﬂow. However, we will not account forthat difference, and we will assume that the reference temperature for this case is the sameas given in Example 18.2. Hence, from Example 18.2, we have Re ∗ c=3.754×107andρ∗=0.574 kg/m3 From Equation (19.3), we have C∗ f=0.074 (Re∗ c)1/5=0.074 (3.754 ×107)1/5=2.26×10−3 From Equation (19.4), Df=1 2ρ∗u2 eSC∗ f=1 2(0.574)(1000)2(40)(2.26 ×10−3)=25,945 N Hence, D=2(25,945) =51,890 N Comparing this answer with that obtained in Example 19.1b , we ﬁnd a 20 percent dis- crepancy between the two methods of calculations. This is not surprising. It simply points out the great uncertainty in making calculations of turbulent skin friction.1056 PART 4Viscous Flow 19.2.2 The Meador-Smart Reference Temperature Method for Turbulent Flow The method developed recently by Meador and Smart, discussed in Section 18.4.1, gives a reference temperature equation for turbulent ﬂow slightly different thanthat for laminar ﬂow.

Using results from Chapters 18 and 19, airfoil drag in low-speed incompressible ﬂow is treated in Section 4.12, and supersonic airfoil dragis discussed in Section 12.4. If you have not read Sections 4.12 and 12.4, do sonow. They give an important practical application of the boundary-layer resultswe have just covered. Indeed, Sections 4.12 and 12.4 provide a vital continuationof our discussion of viscous ﬂow, and for all practical purposes they can beconsidered integral sections of Part 4 of this book, although they were inserted inthe earlier chapters to provide some viscous ﬂow reality to our otherwise inviscidﬂow presentations. The prediction of airfoil drag is one of the most importantaspects of aerodynamics. Take it seriously, and make certain that you read, orhave read, Sections 4.12 and 12.4. 19.3 TURBULENCE MODELING The simple equations given in Section 19.2 for boundary-layer thickness andskin-friction coefﬁcient for a turbulent ﬂow over a ﬂat plate are simpliﬁed resultsthat are heavily empirically based. Modern calculations of turbulent ﬂows over1058 PART 4Viscous Flow arbitrarily shaped bodies involve the solution of the continuity, momentum, and energy equations along with some model of the turbulence. The calculations are carried out by means of computational ﬂuid dynamic techniques. Here wewill discuss only one model of tubulence, the Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model,which has become popular over the past two decades. We emphasize that the following discussion is intended only to give you the ﬂavor of what is meant by aturbulence model. 19.3.1 The Baldwin-Lomax Model In order to include the effects of turbulence in any analysis or computation, itis ﬁrst necessary to have a model for the turbulence itself. Turbulence modelingis a state-of-the-art subject, and a recent survey of such modeling as applied tocomputations is given in Reference 81. Again, it is beyond the scope of the presentbook to give a detailed presentation of various turbulence models; the reader isreferred to the literature for such matters. Instead, we choose to discuss only onesuch model here, because: (a) it is a typical example of an engineering-orientedturbulence model, (b) it is the model used in the majority of modern applicationsin turbulent, subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic ﬂows, and (c) we will discussin the next chapter several applications which use this model. The model is calledthe Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model, ﬁrst proposed in Reference 82. It is in theclass of what is called an “eddy viscosity” model, where the effects of turbulencein the governing viscous ﬂow equations (such as the boundary-layer equationsor the Navier-Stokes equations) are included simply by adding an additionalterm to the transport coefﬁcients. For example, in all our previous viscous ﬂowequations, μis replaced by (μ+μ T)andkby(k+kT), where μTandkT are the eddy viscosity and eddy thermal conductivity, respectively—both due toturbulence. In these expressions, μandkare denoted as the “molecular” viscosity and thermal conductivity, respectively. For example, the xmomentum boundary- layer equation for turbulent ﬂow is written as ρu∂u ∂x+ρv∂u ∂y=−∂p ∂x+∂ ∂y/bracketleftbigg (μ+μT)∂u ∂y/bracketrightbigg (19.5) Moreover, the Baldwin-Lomax model is also in the class of “algebraic,” or “zero-equation,” models meaning that the formulation of the turbulence model utilizesjust algebraic relations involving the ﬂow properties. This is in contrast to one-and two-equation models which involve partial differential equations for the con-vection, creation, and dissipation of the turbulent kinetic energy and (frequently)the local vorticity. (See Reference 83 for a concise description of such one- andtwo-equation turbulence models.) The Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model is described below. We give just a “cookbook” prescription for the model; the motivation and justiﬁcation for themodel are described at length in Reference 82. This, like all other turbulence mod-els, is highly empirical. The ﬁnal justiﬁcation for its use is that it yields reasonableresults across a wide range of Mach numbers, from subsonic to hypersonic. TheCHAPTER 19 Turbulent Boundary Layers 1059 model assumes that the turbulent-boundary layer is split into two layers, an inner and an outer layer, with different expressions for μTin each layer: μT=/braceleftbigg(μT)inner y≤ycrossover (μT)outer y≥ycrossover(19.6) where yis the local normal distance from the wall, and the crossover point from the inner to the outer layer is denoted by ycrossover . By deﬁnition, ycrossover is that point in the turbulent boundary where (μT)outerbecomes less than (μT)inner. For the inner region: (μT)inner=ρl2|ω| (19.7) where l=ky/bracketleftbigg 1−exp/parenleftbigg−y+ A+/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (19.8) y+=√ρwτwy μw(19.9) andkandA+are two dimensionless constants, speciﬁed later. In Equation (19.7), ωis the local vorticity, deﬁned for a two dimensional ﬂow as ω=∂u ∂y−∂v ∂x(19.10) For the outer region: (μT)outer=ρKC cpFwakeFKleb (19.11) where KandCcpare two additional constants, and FwakeandFKlebare related to the function f(y)=y|ω|/bracketleftbigg 1−exp/parenleftbigg−y+ A+/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (19.12) Equation (19.12) will have a maximum value along a given normal distance y; this maximum value and the location where it occurs are denoted by Fmaxand ymax, respectively. In Equation (19.11), Fwakeis taken to be either ymaxFmaxor CwkymaxU2 dif/Fmax, whichever is smaller, where Cwkis constant, and Udif=/radicalbig u2+v2 (19.13) Also, in Equation (19.11), FKlebis the Klebanoff intermittency factor, given by FKleb(y)=/bracketleftBigg 1+5.5/parenleftbigg CKleby ymax/parenrightbigg6/bracketrightBigg−1 (19.14) The six dimensionless constants that appear in the above equations are: A+= 26.0, Ccp=1.6,CKleb=0.3,Cwk=0.25, k=0.4, and K=0.0168. These con- stants are taken directly from Reference 82 with the understanding that, while theyare not precisely the correct constants for most ﬂows in general, they have been1060 PART 4Viscous Flow used successfully for a number of different applications. Note that, unlike many algebraic eddy viscosity models that are based on a characteristic length, theBaldwin-Lomax model is based on the local vorticity ω. This is a distinct advan- tage for the analysis of ﬂows without an obvious mixing length, such as separatedﬂows. Note that, like all eddy-viscosity turbulent models, the value of μ Tob- tained above is dependent on the ﬂow-ﬁeld properties themselves (for example ω andρ); this is in contrast to the molecular viscosity μ, which is solely a property of the gas itself. The molecular values of viscosity coefﬁcient and thermal conductivity are related through the Prandtl number k=μcp Pr(19.15) In lieu of developing a detailed turbulence model for the turbulent thermal con-ductivity k T, the usual procedure is to deﬁne a “turbulent” Prandtl number as PrT=μTcp/kT. Thus, analogous to Equation (19.15), we have kT=μTcp PrT(19.16) where the usual assumption is that Pr T=1. Therefore, μTis obtained from a given eddy-viscosity model (such as the Baldwin-Lomax model), and the correspondingk Tis obtained from Equation (19.16). Turbulence itself is a ﬂow ﬁeld; it is nota simple property of the gas. This is why, as mentioned above, in an algebraic eddy viscosity model the values ofμ TandkTdepend on the solution of the ﬂow ﬁeld—they are not pure properties of the gas as are μandk. This is clearly seen in the Baldwin-Lomax model via Equation (19.7), where μTis a function of the local vorticity in the ﬂow, ω—a ﬂow-ﬁeld variable which comes out as part of the solution for the particular caseat hand. 19.4 FINAL COMMENTS This chapter and the previous two have dealt with boundary layers, especiallythose on a ﬂat plate. We end with the presentation of an artist’s rendering aphotograph in Figure 19.2 showing the development of velocity proﬁles in theboundary layer over a ﬂat plate. The ﬂuid is water, which ﬂows from left to right.The proﬁles in the original photograph are made visible by the hydrogen bubbletechnique, the same used for Figure 16.13. The Reynolds number is low (thefreestream velocity is only 0.6 m/s); hence, the boundary-layer thickness is large.However, the thickness of the plate is only 0.5 mm, which means that the boundarylayer shown here is on the order of 1 mm thick—still small on an absolute scale.In any event, if you need any further proof of the existence of boundary layers,Figure 19.2 is it.CHAPTER 19 Turbulent Boundary Layers 1061 Figure 19.2 Rendering of velocity proﬁles for the laminar ﬂow over a ﬂat plate.

When the continuity, momentum, and energy equations are used to solve aturbulent ﬂow, some type of turbulence model must be used. In the eddyviscosity concept, the viscosity coefﬁcient and thermal conductivity in theseequations must be the sumof the molecular and turbulent values.1062 PART 4Viscous Flow 19.6 PROBLEMS Note: The standard sea level value of viscosity coefﬁcient for air is μ=1.7894 × 10−5kg/(m ·s)=3.7373 ×10−7slug/(ft ·s). 19.1 The wing on a Piper Cherokee general aviation aircraft is rectangular, with a span of 9.75 m and a chord of 1.6 m. The aircraft is ﬂying at cruisingspeed (141 mi/h) at sea level. Assume that the skin-friction drag on thewing can be approximated by the drag on a ﬂat plate of the samedimensions. Calculate the skin-friction drag: a. If the ﬂow were completely laminar (which is not the case in real life) b. If the ﬂow were completely turbulent (which is more realistic) Compare the two results. 19.2 For the case in Problem 19.1, calculate the boundary-layer thickness at thetrailing edge for a.

[Hint:Compare Equations (18.32) and (18.41).] 19.7 Consider a high-speed vehicle ﬂying at a standard altitude of 35 km,where the ambient pressure and temperature are 583.59 N/m 2and 246.1 K, respectively. The radius of the spherical nose of the vehicle is2.54 cm. Assume the Prandtl number for air at these conditions is 0.72,thatc pis 1008 joules/(kg K), and that the viscosity coefﬁcient is given by Sutherland’s law. The wall temperature at the nose is 400 K. Assume therecovery factor at the nose is 1.0. Calculate the aerodynamic heat transferto the stagnation point for ﬂight velocities of (a)1500 m/s, and (b)4500 m/s. From these results, make a comment about how the heat transfer varies with ﬂight velocity.CHAPTER20 Navier-Stokes Solutions: Some Examples A numerical simulation of the ﬂow over an airfoil using the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations can be conducted on today’s supercomputers in lessthan a half hour for less than $1000 cost in computer time. If just one such simulation had been attempted 20 years ago on computers of that time (e.g., theIBM 704 class) and with algorithms then known, the cost in computer timewould have amounted to roughly $10 million, and the results for that single ﬂow would not be available until 10 years from now, since the computation wouldhave taken about 30 years to complete. Dean R. Chapman, NASA, 1977 PREVIEW BOX This is a short chapter about a very extensive subject— the numerical solution of general viscous ﬂows. Thisis the ultimate method for solving general ﬂow ﬁeldsincluding friction and thermal conduction throughoutthe whole ﬂow ﬁeld. This chapter is in the purviewof computational ﬂuid dynamics—a whole subject initself. The purpose of this chapter is simply to roundout our discussion of viscous ﬂow and to bring someclosure to the subject. So read on, and allow yourselfto be rounded out.In so doing, pay close attention to the section dealing with the accuracy of the prediction of skin-friction drag. You will see that no matter how hardwe try, there is still room for improvement. This is agood thing. Aerodynamics in general is still an evolv-ing intellectual subject, and there is plenty of roomfor you to make your own personal contributions toits improvement. I hope that by reading this book youare inspired to do so. As we say in aerodynamics—onward and upward. 10631064 PART 4Viscous Flow 20.1 INTRODUCTION This chapter is short. Its purpose is to discuss the third option for the solution of vis- cous ﬂows as discussed in Section 15.7, namely, the exact numerical solution of thecomplete Navier-Stokes equations. This option is the purview of modern computa-tional ﬂuid dynamics—it is a state-of-the-art research activity which is currentlyin a rapid state of development. This subject now occupies volumes of mod-ern literature; for a basic treatment, see the deﬁnitive text on computational ﬂuiddynamics listed as Reference 51. We will only list a few sample calculations here. 20.2 THE APPROACH Return to the complete Navier-Stokes equations, as derived in Chapter 15, andrepeated and renumbered below for convenience: Continuity: ∂ρ ∂t=−/bracketleftbigg∂(ρu) ∂x+∂(ρv) ∂y+∂(ρw) ∂z/bracketrightbigg (20.1) x momentum: ∂u ∂t=−u∂u ∂x−v∂u ∂y−w∂u ∂z+1 ρ/bracketleftbigg −∂p ∂x+∂τxx ∂x+∂τyx ∂y+∂τzx ∂z/bracketrightbigg (20.2) y momentum: ∂v ∂t=−u∂v ∂x−v∂v ∂y−w∂v ∂z+1 ρ/bracketleftbigg −∂p ∂y+∂τxy ∂x+∂τyy ∂y+∂τzy ∂z/bracketrightbigg (20.3) z momentum: ∂w ∂t=−u∂w ∂x−v∂w ∂y−w∂w ∂z+1 ρ/bracketleftbigg −∂p ∂z+∂τxz ∂x+∂τyz ∂y+∂τzz ∂z/bracketrightbigg (20.4) Energy: ∂(e+V2/2) ∂t=−u∂(e+V2/2) ∂x−v∂(e+V2/2) ∂y−w∂(e+V2/2) ∂z+˙q +1 ρ/bracketleftbigg∂ ∂x/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂x/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂y/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂y/parenrightbigg +∂ ∂z/parenleftbigg k∂T ∂z/parenrightbigg −∂(pu) ∂x−∂(pv) ∂y−∂(pw) ∂z+∂(uτxx) ∂x(20.5) +∂(uτyx) ∂y+∂(uτzx) ∂z+∂(vτ xy) ∂x+∂(vτ yy) ∂y+∂(vτ zy) ∂z +∂(wτ xz) ∂x+∂(wτ yz) ∂y+∂(wτ zz) ∂z/bracketrightbigg These equations have been written with the time derivatives on the left-hand side and all spatial derivatives on the right-hand side. This is the form suitable to atime-dependent solution of the equations, as discussed in Chapters 13 and 16.CHAPTER 20 Navier-Stokes Solutions: Some Examples 1065 Indeed, Equations (20.1) to (20.5) are partial differential equations that have a mathematically “elliptic” behavior; that is, on a physical basis they treat ﬂow-ﬁeld information and ﬂow disturbances that can travel throughout the ﬂow ﬁeld,in both the upstream and downstream directions. The time-dependent techniqueis particularly suited to such a problem. The time-dependent solution of Equations (20.1) to (20.5) can be carried out in direct parallel to the discussion in Section 16.4. It is important for you to returnto that section and review our discussion of the time-dependent solution of com-pressible Couette ﬂow using MacCormack’s technique. We suggest doing this be-fore reading further. The approach to the solution of Equations (20.1) to (20.5) forother problems is exactly the same. Therefore, we will not elaborate further here. 20.3 EXAMPLES OF SOME SOLUTIONS In this section, we present samples of a few numerical solutions of the completeNavier-Stokes equations. Most of these solutions have the following in common: 1.They were obtained by means of a time-dependent solution using MacCormack’s technique as described in Section 16.4. 2.They utilize the Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model (see Section 19.3.1 for adiscussion of this model). Hence, turbulent ﬂow is modeled in thesecalculations. 3.They require anywhere from thousands to close to a million grid points fortheir solution. Therefore, these are problems that must be solved onlarge-scale digital computers. 20.3.1 Flow over a Rearward-Facing Step The supersonic viscous ﬂow over a rearward-facing step was examined in Ref-erence 44. Some results are shown in Figures 20.1 and 20.2. The ﬂow is movingfrom left to right. In the velocity vector diagram in Figure 20.1, note the separated,recirculating ﬂow region just downstream of the step. The calculation of such sep-arated ﬂows is the forte of solutions of the complete Navier-Stokes equations. Incontrast, the boundary-layer equations discussed in Chapter 17 are not suited forthe analysis of separated ﬂows; boundary-layer calculations usually “blow up” inregions of separated ﬂow. Figure 20.2 shows the temperature contours (lines ofconstant temperature) for the same ﬂow in Figure 20.1. 20.3.2 Flow over an Airfoil The viscous compressible ﬂow over an airfoil was studied in Reference 53. Forthe treatment of this problem, a nonrectangular ﬁnite-difference grid is wrappedaround the airfoil, as shown in Figure 20.3. Equations (20.1) to (20.5) have to betransformed into the new curvilinear coordinate system in Figure 20.3. The detailsare beyond the scope of this book; see Reference 53 for a complete discussion.Some results for the streamline patterns are shown in Figure 20.4a andb. Here, the ﬂow over a Wortmann airfoil at zero angle of attack is shown. The freestream1066 PART 4Viscous Flow Figure 20.1 Velocity vector diagram for the ﬂow over a rearward-facing step.

Drummond: ‘Supersonic Flow over a Rearward Facing Step with Transverse Nonreacting Hydrogen Injection,” AIAA J., vol. 21, no. 12, December 1983, pp. 1707–1713.). Note the recirculating ﬂow region downstream of the step. Figure 20.2 Temperature contours for the ﬂow shown in Figure 20.1. The separated region just downstream of the step is a reasonably constant pressure, constant temperature region. Mach number is 0.5, and the Reynolds number based on chord is relatively low, Re=100,000. The completely laminar ﬂow over this airfoil is shown in Fig- ure 20.4a. Because of the peculiar aerodynamic properties of some low Reynoldsnumber ﬂows over airfoils (see References 48 and 53), we note that the laminarﬂow separated over both the top and bottom surfaces of the airfoil. However, inFigure 20.4b, the turbulence model is turned on for the calculation; note that theﬂow is now completely attached. The differences in Figure 20.4a andbvividly demonstrate the basic trend that turbulent ﬂow resists ﬂow separation much morestrongly than laminar ﬂow.Figure 20.3 Curvilinear, boundary-ﬁtted ﬁnite-difference grid for the solution of the ﬂow over an airfoil.

In Reference 54, a solution of the complete Navier-Stokes equations for the ﬂow ﬁeld over an entireairplane was reported—the ﬁrst such calculation ever made. In this work, Shangand Scherr carried out a time-dependent solution using MacCormack’s method—just as we have discussed it in Section 16.4. See Reference 54 for the details. Also,a lengthy description of this work can be found in Chapter 8 of Reference 52.Shang and Scherr applied their calculation to the hypersonic viscous ﬂow overthe X-24C hypersonic test vehicle. To illustrate the results, the surface streamlinepattern is shown in Figure 20.5. In reality, since the ﬂow velocity is zero at the Figure 20.5 Surface shear stress lines on the X-24C (Data Source: Shang, J. S., and S. J. Scherr: “Navier-Stokes Solution for a Complete Re-Entry Conﬁguration,” J.

The qualitative physical aspects of a two-dimensionalshock-wave/boundary-layer interaction are sketched in Figure 20.6. Here we seea boundary layer growing along a ﬂat plate, where at some downstream locationan incident shock wave impinges on the boundary layer. The large pressure riseacross the shock wave acts as a severe adverse pressure gradient imposed on theboundary layer, thus causing the boundary layer to locally separate from the sur-face. Because the high pressure behind the shock feeds upstream through thesubsonic portion of the boundary layer, the separation takes place ahead of theimpingement point of the incident shock wave. In turn, the separated boundarylayer induces a shock wave, identiﬁed here as the induced separation shock. Theseparated boundary layer subsequently turns back toward the plate, reattaching tothe surface at the reattachment shock. Between the separation and reattachmentshocks, expansion waves are generated where the boundary layer is turning backtoward the surface. At the point of reattachment, the boundary layer has becomerelatively thin, the pressure is high, and consequently this becomes a region ofhigh local aerodynamic heating. Further away from the plate, the separation andreattachment shocks merge to form the conventional “reﬂected shock wave” thatis expected from the classical inviscid picture (see, for example, Figure 9.17).The scale and severity of the interaction picture shown in Figure 20.6 depends onwhether the boundary layer is laminar or turbulent.

However, the general qualitative aspects of the interactionas sketched in Figure 20.6 are the same. The ﬁrst discussion in this book of the physical aspects of shock-wave/ boundary-layer interactions can be found in Section 9.9, with a speciﬁc applicationto shock waves inside nozzles in Section 10.6. If you have not read Sections 9.9and 10.6, now is the time to pause and read these two sections. The ﬂuid dynamic and mathematical details of the interaction region sketched in Figure 20.6 are complex, and the full prediction of this ﬂow is still a state-of-the-art research problem. However, great strides have been made in recent yearswith the application of computational ﬂuid dynamics to this problem, and so-lutions of the full Navier-Stokes equations for the ﬂow sketched in Figure 20.6have been obtained. For example, experimental and computational data for thetwo-dimensional interaction of a shock wave impinging on a turbulent ﬂat plateboundary layer are given in Figure 20.7. In Figure 20.7a, the ratio of surfacepressure to freestream total pressure is plotted versus distance along the surface(nondimensionalized by δ 0, the boundary-layer thickness ahead of the interac- tion). Here, x0is taken as the theoretical inviscid ﬂow impingement point for the incident shock wave. The freestream Mach number is 3. The Reynolds numberbased on δ 0is about 106. Note in Figure 20.7a that the surface pressure ﬁrst in- creases at the front of the interaction region (ahead of the theoretical incident shockimpingement point), reaches a plateau through the center of the separated region,and then increases again as the reattachment point is approached. The pressurevariation shown in Figure 20.7a is typical of that for a two-dimensional shock- wave/boundary-layer interaction. The open circles correspond to experimentalmeasurements of Reda and Murphy (Reference 84). The curve is obtained froma numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations as reported in Reference 82and using the Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model discussed in Section 19.3.1. InFigure 20.7b the variation of surface shear stress plummets to zero, reverses its direction (negative values) in a rather complex variation, and then recovers to apositive value in the vicinity of the reattachment point. The two circles on the hor-izontal axis denote measured separation and reattachment points, and the curveis obtained from the calculations of Reference 82. 20.3.5 Flow over an Airfoil with a Protuberance Here we show some very recent Navier-Stokes solutions carried out to study theaerodynamic effect of a small protuberance extending from the bottom surface ofan airfoil. These calculations represent an example of the state-of-the-art of fullNavier-Stokes solutions at the time of writing. The work was carried out by Beierle(Reference 85). The basic shape of the airfoil was an NACA 0015 section. Thecomputational ﬂuid dynamic solution of the Navier-Stokes equations was carriedout using a time-marching ﬁnite volume code labeled OVERFLOW, developed byNASA (Reference 86). The ﬂow was low speed, with a freestream Mach numberCHAPTER 20 Navier-Stokes Solutions: Some Examples 1071 00.050.100.15Experiment Calculation –120 – 4 –2 0246 –6120 80 40 0/H9270w N/H11408m2pw/H11408p0/H11009 –40 –80160200(a) x – x0 /H92540 (b) Figure 20.7 Effects of shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction on (a) pressure distribution, and (b) shear stress for Mach 3 turbulent ﬂow over a ﬂat plate. of 0.15 and Reynolds number of 1.5 ×106. The fully turbulent ﬂow ﬁeld was simulated using a one-equation turbulence model. Using a proper grid is vital to the integrity of any Navier-Stokes CFD solution. For the present case, Figures 20.8–20.11 show the grid used, progressing from the big picture of the whole grid (Figure 20.8) to the detail of the grid around thesmall protuberance on the bottom surface of the airfoil (Figure 20.11). The grid isan example of a chimera grid, a series of independent but overlapping grids thatare generated about individual parts of the body and for speciﬁc ﬂow regions. Some results for the computed ﬂow ﬁeld are shown in Figures 20.12 and 20.13. In Figure 20.12, the local velocity vector ﬁeld is shown; the ﬂow separation1072 PART 4Viscous Flow Protuberance gridAirfoil gridFar field gridz Wake cut grid x Figure 20.8 Individual grid boundary outlines used in the chimera grid scheme for calculating the ﬂow over an airfoil with a protuberance. and locally reversed ﬂow can be seen downstream of the protuberance. In Fig- ure 20.13, pressure contours are shown, illustrating how the small protuber-ance generates a substantially asymmetric ﬂow over the otherwise symmetricairfoil. Finally, results for a related ﬂow are shown in Figure 20.14. Here, instead of a protuberance existing on the bottom surface, an array of small jets that aredistributed over the bottom surface alternately blow and suck air into and outof the ﬂow in such a manner that the net mass ﬂow added is zero, so-called“zero-mass synthetic jets.” The resulting series of large-scale vortices is shownin Figure 20.14—another example of a ﬂow ﬁeld that can only be solved indetail by means of a full Navier-Stokes solution. (See Hassan and JanakiRam,Reference 87, for details.) 20.4 THE ISSUE OF ACCURACY FOR THE PREDICTION OF SKIN FRICTION DRAG The aerodynamic drag on a body is the sum of pressure drag and skin frictiondrag. For attached ﬂows, the prediction of pressure drag is obtained from inviscidﬂow analyses such as those presented in Parts 2 and 3 of this book. For separatedﬂows, various approximate theories for pressure drag have been advanced overthe last century, but today the only viable and general method of the analysis ofpressure drag for such ﬂows is a complete numerical Navier-Stokes solution.CHAPTER 20 Navier-Stokes Solutions: Some Examples 1073 xz Figure 20.9 Zoom view of the airfoil, wake cut, and protuberance grids. The prediction of skin friction on the surface of a body in an attached ﬂow is nicely accomplished by means of a boundary-layer solution coupled with an inviscid ﬂow analysis to deﬁne the ﬂow conditions at the edge of the boundarylayer. Such an approach is well-developed, and the calculations can be rapidlycarried out on local computer workstations. Therefore, the use of boundary-layersolutions for skin friction and aerodynamic heating is the preferred engineeringapproach. However, as mentioned above, if regions of ﬂow separation are present,1074 PART 4Viscous Flow xz Figure 20.10 Zoom view of protuberance grid along the bottom surface of the airfoil.

Figure 20.14 Streamline pattern over the bottom of an NACA 0012 airfoil, over which a series of jets is distributed which are alternatively blowing or sucking mass into or out of the ﬂow, with the overall net mass injected into the ﬂow being zero—a zero-mass jetarray. (Data Source: Hassan, A. A., and JanakiRam, R. D.: “Effects of Zero-Mass ‘Synthetic’ Jets on the Aerodynamics of the NACA-0012 Airfoil,” AIAA PaperNo. 97-2326, 1997). this approach cannot be used. In its place, a full Navier-Stokes solution can be used to obtain local skin friction and heat transfer, but these Navier-Stokes solutionsare still not in the category of “quick engineering calculations.” This leads us to the question of the accuracy of CFD Navier-Stokes solutions for skin friction drag and heat transfer. There are three aspects that tend to diminishthe accuracy of such solutions for the prediction of τ wand˙qw(or alternately, cf andCH): 1.The need to have a very closely spaced grid in the vicinity of the wall in order to obtain an accurate numerical value of (∂u/∂y)wand(∂T/∂y)w, from which τwand˙qware obtained. 2.The uncertainty in the accuracy of turbulence models when a turbulent ﬂowis being calculated. 3.The lack of ability of most turbulent models to predict transition fromlaminar to turbulent ﬂow. In spite of all the advances made in CFD to the present, and all the work that has gone into turbulence modeling, at the time of writing the ability of1076 PART 4Viscous Flow Navier-Stokes solutions to predict skin friction in a turbulent ﬂow seems to be no better than about 20 percent accuracy, on the average. A study by Lombardi et al.(Reference 88) has made this clear. They calculated the skin friction drag on anNACA 0012 airfoil at zero angle of attack in a low-speed ﬂow using both a stan-dard boundary-layer code and a state-of-the-art Navier-Stokes solver with threedifferent state-of-the-art turbulence models. The results for friction drag from theboundary-layer code had been validated with experiment, and were consideredthe baseline for accuracy. The boundary-layer code also had a prediction for tran-sition that was considered reliable. Some typical results reported in Reference 88for the integrated friction drag coefﬁcient C fare as follows, where NS repre- sents Navier-Stokes solver and with the turbulence model in parenthesis. Thecalculations were all for Re =3×10 Cf×103 NS (Standard k−ε) 7.486 NS (RNG k−ε) 6.272 NS (Reynolds stress) 6.792 Boundary Layer Solution 5.340 Clearly, the accuracy of the various Navier-Stokes calculations ranged from18 percent to 40 percent. More insight can be gained from the spatial distribution of the local skin- friction coefﬁcient c falong the surface of the airfoil, as shown in Figure 20.15. Again the three different Navier-Stokes calculations are compared with the results 0 0.2 0.4 x/H11408ccf 0.6 0.8 100.0020.0040.0060.0080.01Blows Fluent standard k-/H9280Fluent RNG k-/H9280Fluent RSM Blows Fluent standard k /H9280 Fluent RNG k /H9280 Fluent RSM Figure 20.15 Distribution of the skin-friction coefﬁcient over the surface of an NACA 0012 airfoil at zero angle of attack in low-speed ﬂow.

All the Navier-Stokes calculations greatly overes- timated the peak in cfjust downstream of the leading edge, and slightly under- estimated cfnear the trailing edge. For a completely different reason not having to do with our discussion of accuracy, but for purposes of showing and contrasting the physically differentdistribution of c falong a ﬂat plate compared with that along the surface of the airfoil, we show Figure 20.16. Here the heavy curve is the variation of cfwith distance from the leading edge for a ﬂat plate; the monotonic decrease is expectedfrom our previous discussions of ﬂat plate boundary layers. In contrast, for theairfoil c frapidly increases from a value of zero at the stagnation point to a peak value shortly downstream of the leading edge. This rapid increase is due to therapidly increasing velocity as the ﬂow external to the boundary layer rapidly ex-pands around the leading edge. Beyond the peak, c fthen monotonically decreases in the same qualitative manner as for a ﬂat plate. It is simply interesting to notethese different variations for c fover an airfoil compared to that for a ﬂat plate, es- pecially since we devoted so much attention to ﬂat plates in the previous chapters. 20.5 SUMMARY With this, we end our discussion of viscous ﬂow. The purpose of all of Part 4has been to introduce you to the basic aspects of viscous ﬂow. The subject isso vast that it demands a book in itself—many of which have been written (see,e.g., References 39 through 43). Here, we have presented only enough materialto give you a ﬂavor for some of the basic ideas and results. This is a subject ofgreat importance in aerodynamics, and if you wish to expand your knowledge1078 PART 4Viscous Flow and expertise of aerodynamics in general, we encourage you to read further on the subject. We are also out of our allotted space for this book. Therefore, we hope that you have enjoyed and beneﬁted from our presentation of the fundamentals ofaerodynamics. However, before closing the cover, it might be useful to return onceagain to Figure 1.44, which is the block diagram categorizing the different generaltypes of aerodynamic ﬂows. Recall the curious, uninitiated thoughts you mighthave had when you ﬁrst examined this ﬁgure during your study of Chapter 1, andcompare these with the informed and mature thoughts that you now have—honedby the aerodynamic knowledge packed into the intervening pages. Hopefully,each block in Figure 1.44 has substantially more meaning for you now than whenwe ﬁrst started. If this is true, then my efforts as an author have not gone in vain.APPENDIX A Isentropic Flow Properties Mp0 pρ0 ρT0 TA A∗ 0.2000 −01 0.1000 +01 0.1000 +01 0.1000 +01 0.2894 +02 0.4000 −01 0.1001 +01

ABOUT THE STANDARD ATMOSPHERE TABLES IN APPENDICES D AND E The following Standard Atmosphere Tables are compiled from mean experimental data for the temperature variation with altitude, combined with the laws of physicsto compute the corresponding variation of pressure and density. The laws ofphysics used are the hydrostatic equation (Equation 1.52) and the equation of state(Equation 7.1). The construction of the Standard Atmosphere Tables is discussedin detail in Chapter 3 of Reference 2, which you should read to learn the wholestory. In Appendices D and E, the temperature, pressure, and density are tabulatedversus altitude. Two columns for altitude are given, the ﬁrst for the geometricaltitude, h G, and the second for the geopotential altitude, h. The geometric altitude is the actual height above standard sea level, and the geopotential altitude is arelated altitude based on the assumption of a constant value of the accelerationof gravity used for the calculations. See Reference 2 for an explanation of thedifference. In this book, whenever a reference is made to a certain value of thestandard altitude, it means the value of h G, the ﬁrst column in the tables. Appendix D gives the Standard Atmosphere in SI units, and Appendix E gives the Standard Atmosphere in English Engineering units. There exist tablesof the standard atmosphere compiled by various organizations over the years. Thevalues tabulated in Appendices D and E are taken from the 1959 ARDC modelatmosphere compiled by the U.S. Air Force. 10931094 Appendix D Standard Atmosphere, SI Units Altitude hG,m h, m Temperature
