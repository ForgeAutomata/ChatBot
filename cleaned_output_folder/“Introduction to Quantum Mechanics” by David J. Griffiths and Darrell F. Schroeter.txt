Introduction to Quantum Mechanics Third edition Changes and additions to the new edition of this classic textbook include: •A new chapter on Symmetries and Conservation Laws •New problems and examples •Improved explanations •More numerical problems to be worked on a computer •New applications to solid state physics •Consolidated treatment of time-dependent potentials David J. Grifﬁths received his BA (1964) and PhD (1970) from Harvard University. He taught at Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College, and Trinity College before joining the faculty at Reed College in 1978. In 2001–2002 he was visiting Professor of Physics at the Five Col- leges (UMass, Amherst, Mount Holyoke, Smith, and Hampshire), and in the spring of 2007 he taught Electrodynamics at Stanford. Although his PhD was in elementary particle theory, most of his research is in electrodynamics and quantum mechanics. He is the author of over ﬁfty arti- cles and four books: Introduction to Electrodynamics (4th edition, Cambridge University Press, 2013), Introduction to Elementary Particles (2nd edition, Wiley-VCH, 2008), Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (2nd edition, Cambridge, 2005), and Revolutions in Twentieth-Century Physics (Cambridge, 2013). Darrell F. Schroeter is a condensed matter theorist. He received his BA (1995) from Reed College and his PhD (2002) from Stanford University where he was a National Science Foun- dation Graduate Research Fellow. Before joining the Reed College faculty in 2007, Schroeter taught at both Swarthmore College and Occidental College. His record of successful theoret- ical research with undergraduate students was recognized in 2011 when he was named as a KITP-Anacapa scholar.INTRODUCTION TO Quantum Mechanics Third edition DAVID J.

r t I T h e o r y ◈1THE WAVE FUNCTION 1.1 THE SCHRÖDINGER EQUATION Imagine a particle of mass m, constrained to move along the xaxis, subject to some speciﬁed force F(x,t)(Figure 1.1). The program of classical mechanics is to determine the position of the particle at any given time: x(t). Once we know that, we can ﬁgure out the velocity (v= dx/dt), the momentum (p=mv), the kinetic energy/parenleftbig T=(1/2)mv2/parenrightbig , or any other dynamical variable of interest. And how do we go about determining x(t)? We apply Newton’s second law: F=ma.( F o r conservative systems—the only kind we shall consider, and, fortunately, the only kind that occur at the microscopic level—the force can be expressed as the derivative of a potential energy function,1F=−∂V/∂x, and Newton’s law reads md2x/dt2=−∂V/∂x.) This, together with appropriate initial conditions (typically the position and velocity at t=0), determines x(t). Quantum mechanics approaches this same problem quite differently. In this case what we’re looking for is the particle’s wave function ,/Psi1(x,t), and we get it by solving the Schrödinger equation : i/planckover2pi1∂/Psi1 ∂t=−/planckover2pi12 2m∂2/Psi1 ∂x2+V/Psi1. (1.1) Here iis the square root of −1, and /planckover2pi1is Planck’s constant—or rather, his original constant ( h) divided by 2π: /planckover2pi1=h 2π=1.054573×10−34Js. (1.2) The Schrödinger equation plays a role logically analogous to Newton’s second law: Given suitable initial conditions (typically, /Psi1(x,0)), the Schrödinger equation determines /Psi1(x,t) for all future time, just as, in classical mechanics, Newton’s law determines x(t)for all future time.2 1.2 THE STATISTICAL INTERPRETATION But what exactly isthis “wave function,” and what does it do for you once you’ve gotit? After all, a particle, by its nature, is localized at a point, whereas the wave function (as its name 1Magnetic forces are an exception, but let’s not worry about them just yet. By the way, we shall assume throughout this book that the motion is nonrelativistic (v/lessmuchc). 2For a delightful ﬁrst-hand account of the origins of the Schrödinger equation see the article by Felix Bloch in Physics Today , December 1976.4 CHAPTER 1 The Wave Function x x(t)m F(x,t) Figure 1.1: A “particle” constrained to move in one dimension under the inﬂuence of a speciﬁed force.

How can such an object represent the state of a particle ? The answer is provided by Born’s statistical interpretation , which says that |/Psi1(x,t)|2gives the probability of ﬁnding the particle at point x, at time t—or, more precisely,3 /integraldisplayb a|/Psi1(x,t)|2dx=/braceleftbiggprobability of ﬁnding the particle between aandb,at time t./bracerightbigg (1.3) Probability is the area under the graph of |/Psi1|2. For the wave function in Figure 1.2, you would be quite likely to ﬁnd the particle in the vicinity of point A, where|/Psi1|2is large, and relatively unlikely to ﬁnd it near point B. The statistical interpretation introduces a kind of indeterminacy into quantum mechanics, for even if you know everything the theory has to tell you about the particle (to wit: its wave function), still you cannot predict with certainty the outcome of a simple experiment to measure its position—all quantum mechanics has to offer is statistical information about the possi- bleresults. This indeterminacy has been profoundly disturbing to physicists and philosophers alike, and it is natural to wonder whether it is a fact of nature, or a defect in the theory. Suppose I domeasure the position of the particle, and I ﬁnd it to be at point C.4Question: Where was the particle just before I made the measurement? There are three plausible answers 3The wave function itself is complex, but |/Psi1|2=/Psi1∗/Psi1(where/Psi1∗is the complex conjugate of /Psi1) is real and non-negative—as a probability, of course, must be. 4Of course, no measuring instrument is perfectly precise; what I mean is that the particle was found in the vicinity of C, as deﬁned by the precision of the equipment.1.2 The Statistical Interpretation 5 to this question, and they serve to characterize the main schools of thought regarding quantum indeterminacy: The realist position: The particle was at C. This certainly seems reasonable, and it is the response Einstein advocated. Note, however, that if this is true then quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory, since the particle really was atC, and yet quantum mechanics was unable to tell us so. To the realist, indeterminacy is not a fact of nature, but a reﬂection of our ignorance. As d’Espagnat put it, “the position of the particle was never indeterminate, but was merely unknown to the experimenter.”5Evidently /Psi1is not the whole story—some additional information (known as a hidden variable ) is needed to provide a complete description of the particle. The orthodox position: The particle wasn’t really anywhere. It was the act of measurement that forced it to “take a stand” (though how and why it decided on the point Cwe dare not ask). Jordan said it most starkly: “Observations not only disturb what is to be measured, they produce i t...W e compel [the particle] to assume a deﬁnite position.”6This view (the so-called Copenhagen interpretation ), is associated with Bohr and his followers. Among physicists it has always been the most widely accepted position. Note, however, that if it is correct there is something very peculiar about the act of measurement—something that almost a century of debate has done precious little to illuminate. The agnostic position: Refuse to answer. This is not quite as silly as it sounds—after all, what sense can there be in making assertions about the status of a particle before a measurement, when the only way of knowing whether you were right is precisely to make a measurement, in which case what you get is no longer “before the measurement”? It is metaphysics (in the pejorative sense of the word) to worry about something that cannot, by its nature, be tested. Pauli said: “One should no more rack one’s brain about the problem of whether something one cannot know anything about exists all the same, than about the ancient question of how many angels are able to sit on the point of a needle.”7For decades this was the “fall-back” position of most physicists: they’d try to sell you the orthodox answer, but if you were persistent they’d retreat to the agnostic response, and terminate the conversation. Until fairly recently, all three positions (realist, orthodox, and agnostic) had their parti- sans. But in 1964 John Bell astonished the physics community by showing that it makes an observable difference whether the particle had a precise (though unknown) position prior to 5Bernard d’Espagnat, “The Quantum Theory and Reality” ( Scientiﬁc American , November 1979, p. 165). 6Quoted in a lovely article by N. David Mermin, “Is the moon there when nobody looks?” ( Physics Today ,A p r i l 1985, p. 38). 7Ibid., p. 40.6 CHAPTER 1 The Wave Function x C⏐Ψ⏐2 Figure 1.3: Collapse of the wave function: graph of |/Psi1|2immediately after a measurement has found the particle at point C. the measurement, or not. Bell’s discovery effectively eliminated agnosticism as a viable option, and made it an experimental question whether 1 or 2 is the correct choice. I’ll return to this story at the end of the book, when you will be in a better position to appreciate Bell’s argu- ment; for now, sufﬁce it to say that the experiments have decisively conﬁrmed the orthodox interpretation:8a particle simply does not have a precise position prior to measurement, any more than the ripples on a pond do; it is the measurement process that insists on one partic- ular number, and thereby in a sense creates the speciﬁc result, limited only by the statistical weighting imposed by the wave function. What if I made a second measurement, immediately after the ﬁrst? Would I get Cagain, or does the act of measurement cough up some completely new number each time? On this question everyone is in agreement: A repeated measurement (on the same particle) must return the same value. Indeed, it would be tough to prove that the particle was really found at Cin the ﬁrst instance, if this could not be conﬁrmed by immediate repetition of the measurement. How does the orthodox interpretation account for the fact that the sec- ond measurement is bound to yield the value C? It must be that the ﬁrst measurement radically alters the wave function, so that it is now sharply peaked about C(Figure 1.3). We say that the wave function collapses , upon measurement, to a spike at the point C(it soon spreads out again, in accordance with the Schrödinger equation, so the second mea- surement must be made quickly). There are, then, two entirely distinct kinds of physical processes: “ordinary” ones, in which the wave function evolves in a leisurely fashion under the Schrödinger equation, and “measurements,” in which /Psi1suddenly and discontinuously collapses.9 8This statement is a little too strong: there exist viable nonlocal hidden variable theories (notably David Bohm’s), and other formulations (such as the many worlds interpretation) that do not ﬁt cleanly into any of my three categories. But I think it is wise, at least from a pedagogical point of view, to adopt a clear and coherent platform at this stage, and worry about the alternatives later. 9The role of measurement in quantum mechanics is so critical and so bizarre that you may well be wondering what precisely constitutes a measurement. I’ll return to this thorny issue in the Afterword; for the moment let’s take the naive view: a measurement is the kind of thing that a scientist in a white coat does in the laboratory, with rulers, stopwatches, Geiger counters, and so on.1.2 The Statistical Interpretation 7 Example 1.1 Electron Interference. I have asserted that particles (electrons, for example) have a wave nature, encoded in /Psi1. How might we check this, in the laboratory? The classic signature of a wave phenomenon is interference : two waves in phase interfere constructively, and out of phase they interfere destructively. The wave nature of light was conﬁrmed in 1801 by Young’s famous double-slit experiment, showing interference “fringes” on a distant screen when a monochromatic beam passes through two slits. If essentially the same experiment is done with electrons , the same pattern develops,10conﬁrming the wave nature of electrons. Now suppose we decrease the intensity of the electron beam, until only one electron is present in the apparatus at any particular time. According to the statistical interpretation each electron will produce a spot on the screen. Quantum mechanics cannot predict the precise location of that spot—all it can tell us is the probability of a given electron landing at a particular place. But if we are patient, and wait for a hundred thousand electrons—one at a time—to make the trip, the accumulating spots reveal the classic two-slit interference pattern (Figure 1.4).11 a b c d Figure 1.4: Build-up of the electron interference pattern. (a) Eight electrons, (b) 270 electrons, (c) 2000 electrons, (d) 160,000 electrons. Reprinted courtesy of the Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi, Ltd., Japan. 10Because the wavelength of electrons is typically very small, the slits have to be extremely close together. Histori- cally, this was ﬁrst achieved by Davisson and Germer, in 1925, using the atomic layers in a crystal as “slits.” For an interesting account, see R. K. Gehrenbeck, Physics Today , January 1978, page 34. 11See Tonomura et al., American Journal of Physics , V olume 57, Issue 2, pp. 117–120 (1989), and the amazing asso- ciated video at www.hitachi.com/rd/portal/highlight/quantum/doubleslit/. This experiment can now be done with much more massive particles, including “Bucky-balls”; see M. Arndt, et al., Nature 40, 680 (1999). Incidentally, the same thing can be done with light: turn the intensity so low that only one “photon” is present at a time and you get an identical point-by-point assembly of the interference pattern. See R. S. Aspden, M. J. Padgett, and G. C. Spalding, A m .J .P h y s . 84, 671 (2016).8 CHAPTER 1 The Wave Function Of course, if you close off one slit, or somehow contrive to detect which slit each electron passes through, the interference pattern disappears; the wave function of the emerging particle is now entirely different (in the ﬁrst case because the boundary con- ditions for the Schrödinger equation have been changed, and in the second because of the collapse of the wave function upon measurement). But with both slits open, and no interruption of the electron in ﬂight, each electron interferes with itself; it didn’t pass through one slit or the other, but through both at once, just as a water wave, impinging on a jetty with two openings, interferes with itself. There is nothing mysteri- ous about this, once you have accepted the notion that particles obey a wave equation. The truly astonishing thing is the blip-by-blip assembly of the pattern. In any classi- cal wave theory the pattern would develop smoothly and continuously, simply getting more intense as time goes on. The quantum process is more like the pointillist painting of Seurat: The picture emerges from the cumulative contributions of all the individual dots.12 1.3 PROBABILITY 1.3.1 Discrete Variables Because of the statistical interpretation, probability plays a central role in quantum mechan- ics, so I digress now for a brief discussion of probability theory. It is mainly a question of introducing some notation and terminology, and I shall do it in the context of a simple example. Imagine a room containing fourteen people, whose ages are as follows: one person aged 14, one person aged 15, three people aged 16, two people aged 22, two people aged 24, ﬁve people aged 25. If we let N(j)represent the number of people of age j, then N(14)=1, N(15)=1, N(16)=3, N(22)=2, N(24)=2, N(25)=5, 12I think it is important to distinguish things like interference and diffraction that would hold for any wave theory from the uniquely quantum mechanical features of the measurement process, which derive from the statistical interpretation.1.3 Probability 9 jN(j) 10 11 12 13 14 15 17 16 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 Figure 1.5: Histogram showing the number of people, N(j), with age j, for the example in Section 1.3.1. while N(17), for instance, is zero. The total number of people in the room is N=∞/summationdisplay j=0N(j). (1.4) (In the example, of course, N=14.) Figure 1.5is a histogram of the data. The following are some questions one might ask about this distribution. Question 1 If you selected one individual at random from this group, what is the probability that this person’s age would be 15? Answer One chance in 14, since there are 14 possible choices, all equally likely, of whom only one has that particular age. If P(j)is the probability of getting age j, then P(14)= 1/14,P(15)=1/14,P(16)=3/14, and so on. In general, P(j)=N(j) N. (1.5) Notice that the probability of getting either 14or15 is the sumof the individual probabilities (in this case, 1/7). In particular, the sum of allthe probabilities is 1—the person you select must have some age: ∞/summationdisplay j=0P(j)=1. (1.6) Question 2 What is the most probable age? Answer 25, obviously; ﬁve people share this age, whereas at most three have any other age. The most probable jis the jfor which P(j)is a maximum. Question 3 What is the median age? Answer 23, for 7 people are younger than 23, and 7 are older. (The median is that value of jsuch that the probability of getting a larger result is the same as the probability of getting a smaller result.) Question 4 What is the average (ormean ) age? Answer (14)+(15)+3(16)+2(22)+2(24)+5(25) 14=294 14=21.10 CHAPTER 1 The Wave Function In general, the average value of j(which we shall write thus: /angbracketleftj/angbracketright)i s /angbracketleftj/angbracketright=/summationtextjN(j) N=∞/summationdisplay j=0jP(j). (1.7) Notice that there need not be anyone with the average age or the median age—in this example nobody happens to be 21 or 23. In quantum mechanics the average is usually the quantity of interest; in that context it has come to be called the expectation value . It’s a misleading term, since it suggests that this is the outcome you would be most likely to get if you made a single measurement ( thatwould be the most probable value , not the average value)—but I’m afraid we’re stuck with it. Question 5 What is the average of the squares of the ages? Answer You could get 142=196, with probability 1/14, or 152=225, with probability 1/14, or 162=256, with probability 3/14, and so on. The average, then, is /angbracketleftbig j2/angbracketrightbig =∞/summationdisplay j=0j2P(j). (1.8) In general, the average value of some function ofjis given by /angbracketleftf(j)/angbracketright=∞/summationdisplay j=0f(j)P(j). (1.9) (Equations 1.6,1.7, and 1.8are, if you like, special cases of this formula.) Beware: The average of the squares,/angbracketleftbig j2/angbracketrightbig ,i snotequal, in general, to the square of the average, /angbracketleftj/angbracketright2. For instance, if the room contains just two babies, aged 1 and 3, then/angbracketleftbig j2/angbracketrightbig =5, but/angbracketleftj/angbracketright2=4. Now, there is a conspicuous difference between the two histograms in Figure 1.6,e v e n though they have the same median, the same average, the same most probable value, and the same number of elements: The ﬁrst is sharply peaked about the average value, whereas the second is broad and ﬂat. (The ﬁrst might represent the age proﬁle for students in a big-city classroom, the second, perhaps, a rural one-room schoolhouse.) We need a numerical measure jN(j) jN(j) 123456789 1 0 123456789 1 0 Figure 1.6: Two histograms with the same median, same average, and same most probable value, but different standard deviations.1.3 Probability 11 of the amount of “spread” in a distribution, with respect to the average. The most obvious way to do this would be to ﬁnd out how far each individual is from the average, /Delta1j=j−/angbracketleftj/angbracketright, (1.10) and compute the average of /Delta1j. Trouble is, of course, that you get zero: /angbracketleft/Delta1j/angbracketright=/summationdisplay (j−/angbracketleftj/angbracketright)P(j)=/summationdisplay jP(j)−/angbracketleftj/angbracketright/summationdisplay P(j) =/angbracketleftj/angbracketright−/angbracketleftj/angbracketright=0. (Note that/angbracketleftj/angbracketrightis constant—it does not change as you go from one member of the sample to another—so it can be taken outside the summation.) To avoid this irritating problem you might decide to average the absolute value of/Delta1j. But absolute values are nasty to work with; instead, we get around the sign problem by squaring before averaging: σ2≡/angbracketleftbig (/Delta1j)2/angbracketrightbig . (1.11) This quantity is known as the variance of the distribution; σitself (the square root of the aver- age of the square of the deviation from the average—gulp!) is called the standard deviation . The latter is the customary measure of the spread about /angbracketleftj/angbracketright. There is a useful little theorem on variances: σ2=/angbracketleftbig (/Delta1j)2/angbracketrightbig =/summationdisplay (/Delta1j)2P(j)=/summationdisplay (j−/angbracketleftj/angbracketright)2P(j) =/summationdisplay/parenleftBig j2−2j/angbracketleftj/angbracketright+/angbracketleftj/angbracketright2/parenrightBig P(j) =/summationdisplay j2P(j)−2/angbracketleftj/angbracketright/summationdisplay jP(j)+/angbracketleftj/angbracketright2/summationdisplay P(j) =/angbracketleftbig j2/angbracketrightbig −2/angbracketleftj/angbracketright/angbracketleftj/angbracketright+/angbracketleftj/angbracketright2=/angbracketleftbig j2/angbracketrightbig −/angbracketleftj/angbracketright2. Taking the square root, the standard deviation itself can be written as σ=/radicalBig/angbracketleftbig j2/angbracketrightbig −/angbracketleftj/angbracketright2. (1.12) In practice, this is a much faster way to get σthan by direct application of Equation 1.11: simply calculate/angbracketleftbig j2/angbracketrightbig and/angbracketleftj/angbracketright2, subtract, and take the square root. Incidentally, I warned you a moment ago that/angbracketleftbig j2/angbracketrightbig is not, in general, equal to /angbracketleftj/angbracketright2. Sinceσ2is plainly non-negative (from its deﬁnition 1.11), Equation 1.12 implies that /angbracketleftbig j2/angbracketrightbig ≥/angbracketleftj/angbracketright2, (1.13) and the two are equal only when σ=0, which is to say, for distributions with no spread at all (every member having the same value). 1.3.2 Continuous Variables So far, I have assumed that we are dealing with a discrete variable—that is, one that can take on only certain isolated values (in the example, jhad to be an integer, since I gave ages only in years). But it is simple enough to generalize to continuous distributions. If I select a random person off the street, the probability that her age is precisely 16 years, 4 hours, 27 minutes, and 3.333...seconds is zero. The only sensible thing to speak about is the probability that her age lies in some interval —say, between 16 and 17. If the interval is sufﬁciently short, this probability is proportional to the length of the interval . For example, the chance that her age is between 16 and 16 plus twodays is presumably twice the probability that it is between 16 and12 CHAPTER 1 The Wave Function 16 plus oneday. (Unless, I suppose, there was some extraordinary baby boom 16 years ago, on exactly that day—in which case we have simply chosen an interval too long for the rule to apply. If the baby boom lasted six hours, we’ll take intervals of a second or less, to be on the safe side. Technically, we’re talking about inﬁnitesimal intervals.) Thus /braceleftbiggprobability that an individual (chosen at random) lies between xand(x+dx)/bracerightbigg =ρ(x)dx. (1.14) The proportionality factor, ρ(x), is often loosely called “the probability of getting x,” but this is sloppy language; a better term is probability density . The probability that xlies between a andb(aﬁnite interval) is given by the integral of ρ(x): Pab=/integraldisplayb aρ(x)dx, (1.15) and the rules we deduced for discrete distributions translate in the obvious way: /integraldisplay+∞ −∞ρ(x)dx=1, (1.16) /angbracketleftx/angbracketright=/integraldisplay+∞ −∞xρ(x)dx, (1.17) /angbracketleftf(x)/angbracketright=/integraldisplay+∞ −∞f(x)ρ(x)dx, (1.18) σ2≡/angbracketleftbig (/Delta1x)2/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbig x2/angbracketrightbig −/angbracketleftx/angbracketright2. (1.19) Example 1.2 Suppose someone drops a rock off a cliff of height h. As it falls, I snap a million pho- tographs, at random intervals. On each picture I measure the distance the rock has fallen. Question: What is the average of all these distances? That is to say, what is the time average of the distance traveled?13 Solution: The rock starts out at rest, and picks up speed as it falls; it spends more time near the top, so the average distance will surely be less than h/2. Ignoring air resistance, the distance xat time tis x(t)=1 2gt2. The velocity is dx/dt=gt, and the total ﬂight time is T=√2h/g. The probability that a particular photograph was taken between tandt+dtisdt/T, so the probability that it shows a distance in the corresponding range xtox+dxis dt T=dx gt/radicalbiggg 2h=1 2√ hxdx. 13A statistician will complain that I am confusing the average of a ﬁnite sample (a million, in this case) with the “true” average (over the whole continuum). This can be an awkward problem for the experimentalist, especially when the sample size is small, but here I am only concerned with the trueaverage, to which the sample average is presumably a good approximation.1.3 Probability 13 Thus the probability density (Equation 1.14)i s ρ(x)=1 2√ hx,(0≤x≤h) (outside this range, of course, the probability density is zero). We can check this result, using Equation 1.16: /integraldisplayh 01 2√ hxdx=1 2√ h/parenleftBig 2x1/2/parenrightBig/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleh 0=1.

Figure 1.7shows the graph of ρ(x). Notice that a probability density can be inﬁnite, though probability itself (the integral ofρ) must of course be ﬁnite (indeed, less than or equal to 1). hρ(x) 1 2 xh Figure 1.7: The probability density in Example 1.2:ρ(x)=1/slashBig/parenleftBig 2√ hx/parenrightBig . ∗ Problem 1.1 For the distribution of ages in the example in Section 1.3.1 : (a)Compute/angbracketleftbig j2/angbracketrightbig and/angbracketleftj/angbracketright2.

(The necessary integrals are inside the back cover.) (a)Use Equation 1.16 to determine A. (b)Find/angbracketleftx/angbracketright,/angbracketleftbig x2/angbracketrightbig , andσ. (c)Sketch the graph of ρ(x). 1.4 NORMALIZATION We return now to the statistical interpretation of the wave function (Equation 1.3), which says that|/Psi1(x,t)|2is the probability density for ﬁnding the particle at point x, at time t.I tf o l - lows (Equation 1.16) that the integral of |/Psi1|2over all x must be 1 (the particle’s got to be some where): /integraldisplay+∞ −∞|/Psi1(x,t)|2dx=1. (1.20) Without this, the statistical interpretation would be nonsense. However, this requirement should disturb you: After all, the wave function is supposed to be determined by the Schrödinger equation—we can’t go imposing an extraneous condition on /Psi1without checking that the two are consistent. Well, a glance at Equation 1.1reveals that if /Psi1(x,t)is a solution, so too is A/Psi1(x,t), where Ais any (complex) constant. What we must do, then, is pick this undetermined multiplicative factor so as to ensure that Equation 1.20 is satisﬁed. This process is called normalizing the wave function. For some solutions to the Schrödinger equation the integral is inﬁnite ; in that case nomultiplicative factor is going to make it 1. The same goes for the trivial solution /Psi1=0. Such non-normalizable solutions cannot represent particles, and must be rejected. Physically realizable states correspond to the square-integrable solutions to Schrödinger’s equation.14 But wait a minute! Suppose I have normalized the wave function at time t=0. How do I know that it will stay normalized, as time goes on, and /Psi1evolves? (You can’t keep renormalizing the wave function, for then Abecomes a function of t, and you no longer have a solution to the Schrödinger equation.) Fortunately, the Schrödinger equation has the remarkable property that it automatically preserves the normalization of the wave function— without this crucial feature the Schrödinger equation would be incompatible with the statistical interpretation, and the whole theory would crumble. This is important, so we’d better pause for a careful proof. To begin with, d dt/integraldisplay+∞ −∞|/Psi1(x,t)|2dx=/integraldisplay+∞ −∞∂ ∂t|/Psi1(x,t)|2dx. (1.21) 14Evidently/Psi1(x,t)must go to zero faster than 1 /√|x|,a s|x|→∞ . Incidentally, normalization only ﬁxes the modulus ofA;t h e phase remains undetermined. However, as we shall see, the latter carries no physical signiﬁcance anyway.1.4 Normalization 15 (Note that the integral is a function only of t,s oIu s ea total derivative(d/dt)on the left, but theintegrand is a function of xas well as t, so it’s a partial derivative(∂/∂t)on the right.) By the product rule, ∂ ∂t|/Psi1|2=∂ ∂t/parenleftbig /Psi1∗/Psi1/parenrightbig =/Psi1∗∂/Psi1 ∂t+∂/Psi1∗ ∂t/Psi1. (1.22) Now the Schrödinger equation says that ∂/Psi1 ∂t=i/planckover2pi1 2m∂2/Psi1 ∂x2−i /planckover2pi1V/Psi1, (1.23) and hence also (taking the complex conjugate of Equation 1.23) ∂/Psi1∗ ∂t=−i/planckover2pi1 2m∂2/Psi1∗ ∂x2+i /planckover2pi1V/Psi1∗, (1.24) so ∂ ∂t|/Psi1|2=i/planckover2pi1 2m/parenleftbigg /Psi1∗∂2/Psi1 ∂x2−∂2/Psi1∗ ∂x2/Psi1/parenrightbigg =∂ ∂x/bracketleftbiggi/planckover2pi1 2m/parenleftbigg /Psi1∗∂/Psi1 ∂x−∂/Psi1∗ ∂x/Psi1/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg . (1.25) The integral in Equation 1.21 can now be evaluated explicitly: d dt/integraldisplay+∞ −∞|/Psi1(x,t)|2dx=i/planckover2pi1 2m/parenleftbigg /Psi1∗∂/Psi1 ∂x−∂/Psi1∗ ∂x/Psi1/parenrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle+∞ −∞. (1.26) But/Psi1(x,t)must go to zero as xgoes to(±)inﬁnity—otherwise the wave function would not be normalizable.15It follows that d dt/integraldisplay+∞ −∞|/Psi1(x,t)|2dx=0, (1.27) and hence that the integral is constant (independent of time); if /Psi1is normalized at t=0, it stays normalized for all future time. QED Problem 1.4 At time t=0 a particle is represented by the wave function /Psi1(x,0)=⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩A(x/a), 0≤x≤a, A(b−x)/(b−a),a≤x≤b, 0, otherwise, where A,a, and bare (positive) constants. (a)Normalize/Psi1(that is, ﬁnd A, in terms of aandb). (b)Sketch/Psi1(x,0), as a function of x. (c)Where is the particle most likely to be found, at t=0? (d)What is the probability of ﬁnding the particle to the left of a? Check your result in the limiting cases b=aandb=2a. (e)What is the expectation value of x? 15A competent mathematician can supply you with pathological counterexamples, but they do not arise in physics; for us the wave function and all its derivatives go to zero at inﬁnity.16 CHAPTER 1 The Wave Function ∗ Problem 1.5 Consider the wave function /Psi1(x,t)=Ae−λ|x|e−iωt, where A,λ, andωare positive real constants. (We’ll see in Chapter 2for what potential (V) this wave function satisﬁes the Schrödinger equation.) (a)Normalize/Psi1. (b)Determine the expectation values of xandx2. (c)Find the standard deviation of x. Sketch the graph of |/Psi1|2, as a function of x, and mark the points (/angbracketleftx/angbracketright+σ)and(/angbracketleftx/angbracketright−σ), to illustrate the sense in which σrepresents the “spread” in x. What is the probability that the particle would be found outside this range? 1.5 MOMENTUM For a particle in state /Psi1, the expectation value of xis /angbracketleftx/angbracketright=/integraldisplay+∞ −∞x|/Psi1(x,t)|2dx. (1.28) What exactly does this mean? It emphatically does notmean that if you measure the position of one particle over and over again,/integraltext x|/Psi1|2dxis the average of the results you’ll get. On the contrary: The ﬁrst measurement (whose outcome is indeterminate) will collapse the wave function to a spike at the value actually obtained, and the subsequent measurements (if they’re performed quickly) will simply repeat that same result. Rather, /angbracketleftx/angbracketrightis the average of measure- ments performed on particles all in the state/Psi1, which means that either you must ﬁnd some way of returning the particle to its original state after each measurement, or else you have to prepare a whole ensemble of particles, each in the same state /Psi1, and measure the positions of all of them: /angbracketleftx/angbracketrightis the average of these results. I like to picture a row of bottles on a shelf, each containing a particle in the state /Psi1(relative to the center of the bottle). A graduate student with a ruler is assigned to each bottle, and at a signal they all measure the positions of their respective particles. We then construct a histogram of the results, which should match |/Psi1|2, and compute the average, which should agree with /angbracketleftx/angbracketright. (Of course, since we’re only using a ﬁnite sample, we can’t expect perfect agreement, but the more bottles we use, the closer we ought to come.) In short, the expectation value is the average of measurements on an ensem- ble of identically-prepared systems, not the average of repeated measurements on one and the same system. Now, as time goes on, /angbracketleftx/angbracketrightwill change (because of the time dependence of /Psi1), and we might be interested in knowing how fast it moves. Referring to Equations 1.25 and1.28, we see that16 d/angbracketleftx/angbracketright dt=/integraldisplay x∂ ∂t|/Psi1|2dx=i/planckover2pi1 2m/integraldisplay x∂ ∂x/parenleftbigg /Psi1∗∂/Psi1 ∂x−∂/Psi1∗ ∂x/Psi1/parenrightbigg dx. (1.29) 16To keep things from getting too cluttered, I’ll suppress the limits of integration (±∞).1.5 Momentum 17 This expression can be simpliﬁed using integration-by-parts:17 d/angbracketleftx/angbracketright dt=−i/planckover2pi1 2m/integraldisplay/parenleftbigg /Psi1∗∂/Psi1 ∂x−∂/Psi1∗ ∂x/Psi1/parenrightbigg dx. (1.30) (I used the fact that ∂x/∂x=1, and threw away the boundary term, on the ground that /Psi1 goes to zero at(±)inﬁnity.) Performing another integration-by-parts, on the second term, we conclude: d/angbracketleftx/angbracketright dt=−i/planckover2pi1 m/integraldisplay /Psi1∗∂/Psi1 ∂xdx. (1.31) What are we to make of this result? Note that we’re talking about the “velocity” of the expectation value of x, which is not the same thing as the velocity of the particle . Nothing we have seen so far would enable us to calculate the velocity of a particle. It’s not even clear what velocity means in quantum mechanics: If the particle doesn’t have a determinate position (prior to measurement), neither does it have a well-deﬁned velocity. All we could reasonably ask for is the probability of getting a particular value. We’ll see in Chapter 3how to construct the probability density for velocity, given /Psi1; for the moment it will sufﬁce to postulate that theexpectation value of the velocity is equal to the time derivative of the expectation value of position : /angbracketleftv/angbracketright=d/angbracketleftx/angbracketright dt. (1.32) Equation 1.31 tells us, then, how to calculate /angbracketleftv/angbracketrightdirectly from/Psi1. Actually, it is customary to work with momentum(p=mv), rather than velocity: /angbracketleftp/angbracketright=md/angbracketleftx/angbracketright dt=−i/planckover2pi1/integraldisplay/parenleftbigg /Psi1∗∂/Psi1 ∂x/parenrightbigg dx. (1.33) Let me write the expressions for /angbracketleftx/angbracketrightand/angbracketleftp/angbracketrightin a more suggestive way: /angbracketleftx/angbracketright=/integraldisplay /Psi1∗[x]/Psi1dx, (1.34) /angbracketleftp/angbracketright=/integraldisplay /Psi1∗/bracketleftbig −i/planckover2pi1(∂/∂x)/bracketrightbig /Psi1dx. (1.35) We say that the operator18x“represents” position, and the operator −i/planckover2pi1(∂/∂x)“represents” momentum; to calculate expectation values we “sandwich” the appropriate operator between /Psi1∗and/Psi1, and integrate. 17The product rule says that d dx(fg)=fdg dx+df dxg, from which it follows that /integraldisplayb afdg dxdx=−/integraldisplayb adf dxgdx+fg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleb a. Under the integral sign, then, you can peel a derivative off one factor in a product, and slap it onto the other one—it’ll cost you a minus sign, and you’ll pick up a boundary term. 18An “operator” is an instruction to do something to the function that follows; it takes in one function, and spits out some other function. The position operator tells you to multiply byx; the momentum operator tells you to differentiate with respect to x(and multiply the result by −i/planckover2pi1).18 CHAPTER 1 The Wave Function That’s cute, but what about other quantities? The fact is, allclassical dynamical variables can be expressed in terms of position and momentum. Kinetic energy, for example, is T=1 2mv2=p2 2m, and angular momentum is L=r×mv=r×p (the latter, of course, does not occur for motion in one dimension). To calculate the expectation value of anysuch quantity, Q(x,p), we simply replace every pby−i/planckover2pi1(∂/∂x), insert the resulting operator between /Psi1∗and/Psi1, and integrate: /angbracketleftQ(x,p)/angbracketright=/integraldisplay /Psi1∗/bracketleftbig Q(x,−i/planckover2pi1∂/∂x)/bracketrightbig /Psi1dx. (1.36) For example, the expectation value of the kinetic energy is /angbracketleftT/angbracketright=−/planckover2pi12 2m/integraldisplay /Psi1∗∂2/Psi1 ∂x2dx. (1.37) Equation 1.36 is a recipe for computing the expectation value of any dynamical quantity, for a particle in state /Psi1; it subsumes Equations 1.34 and1.35 as special cases. I have tried to make Equation 1.36 seem plausible, given Born’s statistical interpretation, but in truth this represents such a radically new way of doing business (as compared with classical mechanics) that it’s a good idea to get some practice using it before we come back (in Chapter 3) and put it on a ﬁrmer theoretical foundation. In the mean time, if you prefer to think of it as an axiom , that’s ﬁne with me. Problem 1.6 Why can’t you do integration-by-parts directly on the middle expression in Equation 1.29—pull the time derivative over onto x, note that∂x/∂t=0, and conclude thatd/angbracketleftx/angbracketright/dt=0? ∗ Problem 1.7 Calculate d/angbracketleftp/angbracketright/dt.Answer : d/angbracketleftp/angbracketright dt=/angbracketleftbigg −∂V ∂x/angbracketrightbigg . (1.38) This is an instance of Ehrenfest’s theorem , which asserts that expectation values obey the classical laws.19 Problem 1.8 Suppose you add a constant V0to the potential energy (by “constant” I mean independent of xas well as t). In classical mechanics this doesn’t change anything, but what about quantum mechanics? Show that the wave function picks up a time-dependent phase factor: exp (−iV0t//planckover2pi1). What effect does this have on the expectation value of a dynamical variable? 19Some authors limit the term to the pair of equations /angbracketleftp/angbracketright=md/angbracketleftx/angbracketright/dtand/angbracketleft−∂V/∂x/angbracketright=d/angbracketleftp/angbracketright/dt.1.6 The Uncertainty Principle 19 x (feet) 10 20 30 40 50 Figure 1.8: A wave with a (fairly) well-deﬁned wavelength , but an ill-deﬁned position . x (feet) 10 20 30 40 50 Figure 1.9: A wave with a (fairly) well-deﬁned position , but an ill-deﬁned wavelength . 1.6 THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE Imagine that you’re holding one end of a very long rope, and you generate a wave by shaking it up and down rhythmically (Figure 1.8). If someone asked you “Precisely where isthat wave?” you’d probably think he was a little bit nutty: The wave isn’t precisely anywhere—it’s spread out over 50 feet or so. On the other hand, if he asked you what its wavelength is, you could give him a reasonable answer: it looks like about 6 feet. By contrast, if you gave the rope a sudden jerk (Figure 1.9), you’d get a relatively narrow bump traveling down the line. This time the ﬁrst question (Where precisely is the wave?) is a sensible one, and the second (What is its wavelength?) seems nutty—it isn’t even vaguely periodic, so how can you assign a wavelength to it? Of course, you can draw intermediate cases, in which the wave is fairly well localized and the wavelength is fairly well deﬁned, but there is an inescapable trade-off here: the more precise a wave’s position is, the less precise is its wavelength, and vice versa.20A theorem in Fourier analysis makes all this rigorous, but for the moment I am only concerned with the qualitative argument. This applies, of course, to anywave phenomenon, and hence in particular to the quantum mechanical wave function. But the wavelength of /Psi1is related to the momentum of the particle by the de Broglie formula :21 p=h λ=2π/planckover2pi1 λ. (1.39) Thus a spread in wavelength corresponds to a spread in momentum , and our general observation now says that the more precisely determined a particle’s position is, the less precisely is its momentum. Quantitatively, σxσp≥/planckover2pi1 2, (1.40) 20That’s why a piccolo player must be right on pitch, whereas a double-bass player can afford to wear garden gloves. For the piccolo, a sixty-fourth note contains many full cycles, and the frequency (we’re working in the time domain now, instead of space) is well deﬁned, whereas for the bass, at a much lower register, the sixty-fourth note contains only a few cycles, and all you hear is a general sort of “oomph,” with no very clear pitch. 21I’ll explain this in due course. Many authors take the de Broglie formula as an axiom , from which they then deduce the association of momentum with the operator −i/planckover2pi1(∂/∂x). Although this is a conceptually cleaner approach, it involves diverting mathematical complications that I would rather save for later.20 CHAPTER 1 The Wave Function whereσxis the standard deviation in x, andσpis the standard deviation in p. This is Heisen- berg’s famous uncertainty principle . (We’ll prove it in Chapter 3, but I wanted to mention it right away, so you can test it out on the examples in Chapter 2.) Please understand what the uncertainty principle means : Like position measurements, momentum measurements yield precise answers—the “spread” here refers to the fact that mea- surements made on identically prepared systems do not yield identical results. You can, if you want, construct a state such that position measurements will be very close together (by making /Psi1a localized “spike”), but you will pay a price: Momentum measurements on this state will be widely scattered. Or you can prepare a state with a deﬁnite momentum (by making /Psi1a long sinusoidal wave), but in that case position measurements will be widely scattered. And, of course, if you’re in a really bad mood you can create a state for which neither position nor momentum is well deﬁned: Equation 1.40 is an inequality , and there’s no limit on how bigσx andσpcan be—just make /Psi1some long wiggly line with lots of bumps and potholes and no periodic structure. ∗ Problem 1.9 A particle of mass mhas the wave function /Psi1(x,t)=Ae−a/bracketleftbig/parenleftbig mx2//planckover2pi1/parenrightbig +it/bracketrightbig , where Aandaare positive real constants.

Problem 1.11 [This problem generalizes Example 1.2.] Imagine a particle of mass mand energy Ein a potential well V(x), sliding frictionlessly back and forth between the classical turning points ( aandbin Figure 1.10). Classically, the probability of ﬁnding the particle in the range dx(if, for example, you took a snapshot at a random time t) is equal to the fraction of the time Tit takes to get from atobthat it spends in the interval dx: ρ(x)dx=dt T=(dt/dx)dx T=1 v(x)Tdx, (1.41)Further Problems on Chapter 1 21 V(x) E ab dxxm Figure 1.10: Classical particle in a potential well. wherev(x)is the speed, and T=/integraldisplayT 0dt=/integraldisplayb a1 v(x)dx.

(c)What’s the classical uncertainty product, σxσp, for this system? Notice that this product can be as small as you like, classically, simply by sending E→0. But in quantum mechanics, as we shall see in Chapter 2, the energy of a simple harmonic oscillator cannot be less than /planckover2pi1ω/2, whereω=√k/mis the classical frequency. In that case what can you say about the product σxσp? Problem 1.13 Check your results in Problem 1.11(b) with the following “numerical experiment.” The position of the oscillator at time tis x(t)=Acos(ωt). (1.44) 22If you like, instead of photos of onesystem at random times, picture an ensemble of such systems, all with the same energy but with random starting positions, and photograph them all at the same time. The analysis is identical, but this interpretation is closer to the quantum notion of indeterminacy.22 CHAPTER 1 The Wave Function You might as well take ω=1 (that sets the scale for time) and A=1 (that sets the scale for length). Make a plot of xat 10,000 random times, and compare it with ρ(x). Hint: In Mathematica, ﬁrst deﬁne x[t_] := Cos[t] then construct a table of positions: snapshots = Table[x[ πRandomReal[j]], {j, 10000}] and ﬁnally, make a histogram of the data: Histogram[snapshots, 100,/prime/primePDF/prime/prime, PlotRange→{0,2}] Meanwhile, make a plot of the density function, ρ(x), and, using Show , superimpose the two.

What are the units of J(x,t)?Comment: J is called the probability current , because it tells you the rate at which probability is “ﬂowing” past the point x.I f Pab(t)is increasing, then more probability is ﬂowing into the region at one end than ﬂows out at the other. (b)Find the probability current for the wave function in Problem 1.9. (This is not a very pithy example, I’m afraid; we’ll encounter more substantial ones in due course.)

(h)Check that your results are consistent with the uncertainty principle. ∗∗ Problem 1.17 Suppose you wanted to describe an unstable particle , that spontaneously disintegrates with a “lifetime” τ. In that case the total probability of ﬁnding the particle somewhere should notbe constant, but should decrease at (say) an exponential rate: P(t)≡/integraldisplay+∞ −∞|/Psi1(x,t)|2dx=e−t/τ. A crude way of achieving this result is as follows. In Equation 1.24 we tacitly assumed thatV(the potential energy) is real. That is certainly reasonable, but it leads to the “conservation of probability” enshrined in Equation 1.27. What if we assign to Van imaginary part: V=V0−i/Gamma1, where V0is the true potential energy and /Gamma1is a positive real constant? (a)Show that (in place of Equation 1.27) we now get dP dt=−2/Gamma1 /planckover2pi1P. (b)Solve for P(t), and ﬁnd the lifetime of the particle in terms of /Gamma1. Problem 1.18 Very roughly speaking, quantum mechanics is relevant when the de Broglie wavelength of the particle in question (h/p)is greater than the characteristic size of the system(d). In thermal equilibrium at (Kelvin) temperature T, the average kinetic energy of a particle is p2 2m=3 2kBT (where kBis Boltzmann’s constant), so the typical de Broglie wavelength is λ=h√3mkBT. (1.45) The purpose of this problem is to determine which systems will have to be treated quantum mechanically, and which can safely be described classically. (a)Solids. The lattice spacing in a typical solid is around d=0.3 nm. Find the tem- perature below which the unbound23electrons in a solid are quantum mechanical. Below what temperature are the nuclei in a solid quantum mechanical? (Use silicon as an example.) 23In a solid the inner electrons are attached to a particular nucleus, and for them the relevant size would be the radius of the atom. But the outer-most electrons are not attached, and for them the relevant distance is the lattice spacing. This problem pertains to the outer electrons.24 CHAPTER 1 The Wave Function Moral: The free electrons in a solid are always quantum mechanical; the nuclei are generally notquantum mechanical. The same goes for liquids (for which the interatomic spacing is roughly the same), with the exception of helium below 4 K. (b)Gases. For what temperatures are the atoms in an ideal gas at pressure Pquantum mechanical? Hint: Use the ideal gas law (PV=NkBT)to deduce the interatomic spacing. Answer: T<(1/kB)/parenleftbig h2/3m/parenrightbig3/5P2/5. Obviously (for the gas to show quantum behavior) we want mto be as small as possible, and Paslarge as possible. Put in the numbers for helium at atmospheric pressure. Is hydrogen in outer space (where the interatomic spacing is about 1 cm and the temperature is 3 K) quantum mechanical? (Assume it’s monatomic hydrogen, not H 2.)2TIME-INDEPENDENT SCHRÖDINGER EQUATION 2.1 STATIONARY STATES In Chapter 1we talked a lot about the wave function, and how you use it to calculate various quantities of interest. The time has come to stop procrastinating, and confront what is, logically, the prior question: How do you get/Psi1(x,t)in the ﬁrstplace? We need to solve the Schrödinger equation, i/planckover2pi1∂/Psi1 ∂t=−/planckover2pi12 2m∂2/Psi1 ∂x2+V/Psi1, (2.1) for a speciﬁed potential1V(x,t). In this chapter (and most of this book) I shall assume that Visindependent of t . In that case the Schrödinger equation can be solved by the method of separation of variables (the physicist’s ﬁrst line of attack on any partial differential equation): We look for solutions that are products , /Psi1(x,t)=ψ(x)ϕ(t), (2.2) whereψ(lower -case) is a function of xalone, andϕis a function of talone. On its face, this is an absurd restriction, and we cannot hope to obtain more than a tiny subset of all solutions in this way. But hang on, because the solutions we doget turn out to be of great interest. Moreover (as is typically the case with separation of variables) we will be able at the end to patch together the separable solutions in such a way as to construct the most general solution. For separable solutions we have ∂/Psi1 ∂t=ψdϕ dt,∂2/Psi1 ∂x2=d2ψ dx2ϕ (ordinary derivatives, now), and the Schrödinger equation reads i/planckover2pi1ψdϕ dt=−/planckover2pi12 2md2ψ dx2ϕ+Vψϕ. 1It is tiresome to keep saying “potential energy function,” so most people just call Vthe “potential,” even though this invites occasional confusion with electric potential, which is actually potential energy per unit charge .26 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation Or, dividing through by ψϕ: i/planckover2pi11 ϕdϕ dt=−/planckover2pi12 2m1 ψd2ψ dx2+V. (2.3) Now, the left side is a function of talone, and the right side is a function of xalone.2The only way this can possibly be true is if both sides are in fact constant —otherwise, by varying t, I could change the left side without touching the right side, and the two would no longer be equal. (That’s a subtle but crucial argument, so if it’s new to you, be sure to pause and think it through.) For reasons that will appear in a moment, we shall call the separation constant E. Then i/planckover2pi11 ϕdϕ dt=E, or dϕ dt=−iE /planckover2pi1ϕ, (2.4) and −/planckover2pi12 2m1 ψd2ψ dx2+V=E, or −/planckover2pi12 2md2ψ dx2+Vψ=Eψ. (2.5) Separation of variables has turned a partial differential equation into two ordinary differen- tial equations (Equations 2.4and2.5). The ﬁrst of these is easy to solve (just multiply through bydtand integrate); the general solution is Cexp(−iEt//planckover2pi1), but we might as well absorb the constant Cintoψ(since the quantity of interest is the product ψϕ). Then3 ϕ(t)=e−iEt//planckover2pi1. (2.6) The second (Equation 2.5) is called the time-independent Schrödinger equation ; we can go no further with it until the potential V(x)is speciﬁed. The rest of this chapter will be devoted to solving the time-independent Schrödinger equa- tion, for a variety of simple potentials. But before I get to that you have every right to ask: What’s so great about separable solutions? After all, most solutions to the (time dependent) Schrödinger equation do nottake the formψ(x)ϕ(t). I offer three answers—two of them physical, and one mathematical: 2Note that this would notbe true if Vwere a function of tas well as x. 3Using Euler’s formula , eiθ=cosθ+isinθ, you could equivalently write ϕ(t)=cos(Et//planckover2pi1)+isin(Et//planckover2pi1); the real and imaginary parts oscillate sinusoidally. Mike Casper (of Carleton College) dubbed ϕthe “wiggle factor”—it’s the characteristic time dependence in quantum mechanics.2.1 Stationary States 27 1.They are stationary states . Although the wave function itself, /Psi1(x,t)=ψ(x)e−iEt//planckover2pi1, (2.7) does (obviously) depend on t,t h e probability density , |/Psi1(x,t)|2=/Psi1∗/Psi1=ψ∗e+iEt//planckover2pi1ψe−iEt//planckover2pi1=|ψ(x)|2, (2.8) does not—the time-dependence cancels out.4The same thing happens in calculating the expectation value of any dynamical variable; Equation 1.36 reduces to /angbracketleftQ(x,p)/angbracketright=/integraldisplay ψ∗/bracketleftbigg Q/parenleftbigg x,−i/planckover2pi1d dx/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg ψdx. (2.9) Every expectation value is constant in time; we might as well drop the factor ϕ(t)alto- gether, and simply use ψin place of/Psi1. (Indeed, it is common to refer to ψas “the wave function,” but this is sloppy language that can be dangerous, and it is important to remember that the truewave function always carries that time-dependent wiggle factor.) In particular,/angbracketleftx/angbracketrightis constant, and hence (Equation 1.33)/angbracketleftp/angbracketright=0. Nothing ever happens in a stationary state. 2.They are states of deﬁnite total energy . In classical mechanics, the total energy (kinetic plus potential) is called the Hamiltonian : H(x,p)=p2 2m+V(x). (2.10) The corresponding Hamiltonian operator , obtained by the canonical substitution p→ −i/planckover2pi1(∂/∂x), is therefore5 ˆH=−/planckover2pi12 2m∂2 ∂x2+V(x). (2.11) Thus the time-independent Schrödinger equation (Equation 2.5) can be written ˆHψ=Eψ, (2.12) and the expectation value of the total energy is /angbracketleftH/angbracketright=/integraldisplay ψ∗ˆHψdx=E/integraldisplay |ψ|2dx=E/integraldisplay |/Psi1|2dx=E. (2.13) (Notice that the normalization of /Psi1entails the normalization of ψ.) Moreover, ˆH2ψ=ˆH/parenleftBig ˆHψ/parenrightBig =ˆH/parenleftBig Eψ/parenrightBig =E/parenleftBig ˆHψ/parenrightBig =E2ψ, and hence /angbracketleftbig H2/angbracketrightbig =/integraldisplay ψ∗ˆH2ψdx=E2/integraldisplay |ψ|2dx=E2. So the variance of His σ2 H=/angbracketleftbig H2/angbracketrightbig −/angbracketleftH/angbracketright2=E2−E2=0. (2.14) 4For normalizable solutions, Emust be real(see Problem 2.1(a)). 5Whenever confusion might arise, I’ll put a “hat” (ˆ) on the operator, to distinguish it from the dynamical variable it represents.28 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation But remember, if σ=0, then every member of the sample must share the same value (the distribution has zero spread). Conclusion: A separable solution has the property thatevery measurement of the total energy is certain to return the value E . (That’s why I chose that letter for the separation constant.) 3.The general solution is a linear combination of separable solutions. As we’re about to discover, the time-independent Schrödinger equation (Equation 2.5) yields an inﬁ- nite collection of solutions (ψ1(x),ψ2(x),ψ3(x),..., which we write as {ψn(x)}), each with its associated separation constant (E1,E2,E3,...={En}); thus there is a different wave function for each allowed energy : /Psi11(x,t)=ψ1(x)e−iE1t//planckover2pi1,/Psi1 2(x,t)=ψ2(x)e−iE2t//planckover2pi1,.... Now (as you can easily check for yourself) the (time- dependent) Schrödinger equation (Equation 2.1) has the property that any linear combination6of solutions is itself a solu- tion. Once we have found the separable solutions, then, we can immediately construct a much more general solution, of the form /Psi1(x,t)=∞/summationdisplay n=1cnψn(x)e−iEnt//planckover2pi1. (2.15) It so happens that every solution to the (time-dependent) Schrödinger equation can be written in this form—it is simply a matter of ﬁnding the right constants (c1,c2,...) so as to ﬁt the initial conditions for the problem at hand. You’ll see in the follow- ing sections how all this works out in practice, and in Chapter 3we’ll put it into more elegant language, but the main point is this: Once you’ve solved the time- independent Schrödinger equation, you’re essentially done; getting from there to the general solution of the time- dependent Schrödinger equation is, in principle, simple and straightforward. A lot has happened in the past four pages, so let me recapitulate, from a somewhat dif- ferent perspective. Here’s the generic problem: You’re given a (time-independent) potential V(x), and the starting wave function /Psi1(x,0); your job is to ﬁnd the wave function, /Psi1(x,t), for any subsequent time t. To do this you must solve the (time-dependent) Schrödinger equa- tion (Equation 2.1). The strategy is ﬁrst to solve the time- independent Schrödinger equation (Equation 2.5); this yields, in general, an inﬁnite set of solutions, {ψn(x)}, each with its own associated energy, {En}.T oﬁ t/Psi1(x,0)you write down the general linear combination of these solutions: /Psi1(x,0)=∞/summationdisplay n=1cnψn(x); (2.16) 6Alinear combination of the functions f1(z),f2(z),...is an expression of the form f(z)=c1f1(z)+c2f2(z)+···, where c1,c2,...are (possibly complex) constants.2.1 Stationary States 29 the miracle is that you can always match the speciﬁed initial state7by appropriate choice of the constants{cn}. To construct/Psi1(x,t)you simply tack onto each term its characteristic time dependence (its “wiggle factor”), exp (−iEnt//planckover2pi1):8 /Psi1(x,t)=∞/summationdisplay n=1cnψn(x)e−iEnt//planckover2pi1=∞/summationdisplay n=1cn/Psi1n(x,t). (2.17) The separable solutions themselves, /Psi1n(x,t)=ψn(x)e−iEnt//planckover2pi1, (2.18) arestationary states, in the sense that all probabilities and expectation values are independent of time, but this property is emphatically notshared by the general solution (Equation 2.17): the energies are different, for different stationary states, and the exponentials do not cancel, when you construct |/Psi1|2. Example 2.1 Suppose a particle starts out in a linear combination of just twostationary states: /Psi1(x,0)=c1ψ1(x)+c2ψ2(x). (To keep things simple I’ll assume that the constants cnand the statesψn(x)arereal.) What is the wave function /Psi1(x,t)at subsequent times? Find the probability density, and describe its motion. Solution: The ﬁrst part is easy: /Psi1(x,t)=c1ψ1(x)e−iE1t//planckover2pi1+c2ψ2(x)e−iE2t//planckover2pi1, where E1andE2are the energies associated with ψ1andψ2.I tf o l l o w st h a t |/Psi1(x,t)|2=/parenleftBig c1ψ1eiE1t//planckover2pi1+c2ψ2eiE2t//planckover2pi1/parenrightBig/parenleftBig c1ψ1e−iE1t//planckover2pi1+c2ψ2e−iE2t//planckover2pi1/parenrightBig =c2 1ψ2 1+c2 2ψ2 2+2c1c2ψ1ψ2cos/bracketleftbig (E2−E1)t//planckover2pi1/bracketrightbig . The probability density oscillates sinusoidally, at an angular frequency ω=(E2−E1)//planckover2pi1; this is certainly nota stationary state. But notice that it took a linear combination of stationary states (with different energies) to produce motion.9 7In principle, anynormalized function /Psi1(x,0)is fair game—it need not even be continuous. How you might actually geta particle into that state is a different question, and one (curiously) we seldom have occasion to ask. 8If this is your ﬁrst encounter with the method of separation of variables, you may be disappointed that the solution takes the form of an inﬁnite series. Occasionally it is possible to sum the series, or to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation without recourse to separation of variables—see, for instance, Problems 2.49,2.50,a n d 2.51. But such cases are extremely rare. 9This is nicely illustrated in an applet by Paul Falstad, at www.falstad.com/qm1d/.30 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation You may be wondering what the coefﬁcients {cn}represent physically . I’ll tell you the answer, though the explanation will have to await Chapter 3: |cn|2is the probability that a measurement of the energy would return the value En.(2.19) A competent measurement will always yield oneof the “allowed” values (hence the name), and|cn|2is the probability of getting the particular value En.10Of course, the sum of these probabilities should be 1: ∞/summationdisplay n=1|cn|2=1, (2.20) and the expectation value of the energy must be /angbracketleftH/angbracketright=∞/summationdisplay n=1|cn|2En. (2.21) We’ll soon see how this works out in some concrete examples. Notice, ﬁnally, that because the constants{cn}are independent of time, so too is the probability of getting a particular energy, and, a fortiori , the expectation value of H. These are manifestations of energy conservation in quantum mechanics. ∗ Problem 2.1 Prove the following three theorems: (a)For normalizable solutions, the separation constant Emust be real.Hint: Write E (in Equation 2.7)a sE0+i/Gamma1(with E0and/Gamma1real), and show that if Equation 1.20 is to hold for all t,/Gamma1must be zero. (b)The time-independent wave function ψ(x)can always be taken to be real(unlike /Psi1(x,t), which is necessarily complex). This doesn’t mean that every solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation isreal; what it says is that if you’ve got one that is not, it can always be expressed as a linear combination of solutions (with the same energy) that are. So you might as well stick toψs that are real. Hint: If ψ(x)satisﬁes Equation 2.5, for a given E, so too does its complex conjugate, and hence also the real linear combinations (ψ+ψ∗)andi(ψ−ψ∗). (c)IfV(x)is an even function (that is, V(−x)=V(x))thenψ(x)can always be taken to be either even or odd. Hint: Ifψ(x)satisﬁes Equation 2.5, for a given E,s ot o o doesψ(−x), and hence also the even and odd linear combinations ψ(x)±ψ(−x). 10Some people will tell you that |cn|2is “the probability that the particle is in the nth stationary state,” but this is bad language: the particle is in the state /Psi1,not/Psi1n, and anyhow, in the laboratory you don’t “ﬁnd the particle to be in a particular state,” you measure some observable, and what you get is a number , not a wave function.2.2 The Inﬁnite Square Well 31 V(x) x a Figure 2.1: The inﬁnite square well potential (Equation 2.22). ∗ Problem 2.2 Show that Emust exceed the minimum value of V(x), for every normalizable solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation. What is the classical analog to this statement? Hint: Rewrite Equation 2.5in the form d2ψ dx2=2m /planckover2pi12[V(x)−E]ψ; ifE<Vmin, thenψand its second derivative always have the same sign —argue that such a function cannot be normalized. 2.2 THE INFINITE SQUARE WELL Suppose V(x)=/braceleftBigg 0,0≤x≤a, ∞,otherwise(2.22) (Figure 2.1). A particle in this potential is completely free, except at the two ends (x=0 and x=a), where an inﬁnite force prevents it from escaping. A classical model would be a cart on a frictionless horizontal air track, with perfectly elastic bumpers—it just keeps bouncing back and forth forever. (This potential is artiﬁcial, of course, but I urge you to treat it with respect. Despite its simplicity—or rather, precisely because of its simplicity—it serves as a wonderfully accessible test case for all the fancy machinery that comes later. We’ll refer back to it frequently.) Outside the well,ψ(x)=0 (the probability of ﬁnding the particle there is zero). Inside the well, where V=0, the time-independent Schrödinger equation (Equation 2.5) reads −/planckover2pi12 2md2ψ dx2=Eψ, (2.23) or d2ψ dx2=−k2ψ, where k≡√ 2mE /planckover2pi1. (2.24) (By writing it in this way, I have tacitly assumed that E≥0; we know from Problem 2.2that E<0 won’t work.) Equation 2.24 is the classical simple harmonic oscillator equation; the general solution is32 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation ψ(x)=Asinkx+Bcoskx, (2.25) where AandBare arbitrary constants. Typically, these constants are ﬁxed by the boundary conditions of the problem. What arethe appropriate boundary conditions for ψ(x)? Ordinarily, bothψand dψ/dx are continuous ,11but where the potential goes to inﬁnity only the ﬁrst of these applies. (I’ll justify these boundary conditions, and account for the exception when V=∞ , in Section 2.5; for now I hope you will trust me.) Continuity ofψ(x)requires that ψ(0)=ψ(a)=0, (2.26) so as to join onto the solution outside the well. What does this tell us about AandB? Well, ψ(0)=Asin 0+Bcos 0=B, soB=0, and hence ψ(x)=Asinkx. (2.27) Thenψ(a)=Asinka, so either A=0 (in which case we’re left with the trivial—non- normalizable—solution ψ(x)=0), or else sin ka=0, which means that ka=0,±π,±2π,±3π,.... (2.28) Butk=0 is no good (again, that would imply ψ(x)=0), and the negative solutions give nothing new, since sin (−θ)=− sin(θ)and we can absorb the minus sign into A.S ot h e distinct solutions are kn=nπ a,with n=1,2,3,.... (2.29) Curiously, the boundary condition at x=adoes not determine the constant A, but rather the constant k, and hence the possible values of E: En=/planckover2pi12k2 n 2m=n2π2/planckover2pi12 2ma2. (2.30) In radical contrast to the classical case, a quantum particle in the inﬁnite square well cannot have just anyold energy—it has to be one of these special (“allowed”) values.12To ﬁnd A,w e normalizeψ:13 /integraldisplaya 0|A|2sin2(kx)dx=|A|2a 2=1,so|A|2=2 a. This only determines the magnitude ofA, but it is simplest to pick the positive real root: A=√2/a(the phase of Acarries no physical signiﬁcance anyway). Inside the well, then, the solutions are ψn(x)=/radicalbigg 2 asin/parenleftBignπ ax/parenrightBig . (2.31) 11That’s right:ψ(x)is a continuous function of x, even though/Psi1(x,t)need not be. 12Notice that the quantization of energy emerges as a rather technical consequence of the boundary conditions on solutions to the time-independent Schrödinger equation. 13Actually, it’s/Psi1(x,t)that must be normalized, but in view of Equation 2.7this entails the normalization of ψ(x).2.2 The Inﬁnite Square Well 33 Ψ1(x) Ψ2(x) Ψ3(x) ax ax a x Figure 2.2: The ﬁrst three stationary states of the inﬁnite square well (Equation 2.31). As promised, the time-independent Schrödinger equation has delivered an inﬁnite set of solutions (one for each positive integer n). The ﬁrst few of these are plotted in Figure 2.2. They look just like the standing waves on a string of length a;ψ1, which carries the lowest energy, is called the ground state , the others, whose energies increase in proportion to n2,a r e called excited states . As a collection, the functions ψn(x)have some interesting and important properties: 1.They are alternately even andodd, with respect to the center of the well: ψ1is even,ψ2 is odd,ψ3is even, and so on.14 2.As you go up in energy, each successive state has one more node (zero-crossing): ψ1 has none (the end points don’t count), ψ2has one,ψ3has two, and so on. 3.They are mutually orthogonal , in the sense that15 /integraldisplay ψm(x)∗ψn(x)dx=0,(m/negationslash=n). (2.32) Proof:/integraldisplay ψm(x)∗ψn(x)dx=2 a/integraldisplaya 0sin/parenleftBigmπ ax/parenrightBig sin/parenleftBignπ ax/parenrightBig dx =1 a/integraldisplaya 0/bracketleftbigg cos/parenleftbiggm−n aπx/parenrightbigg −cos/parenleftbiggm+n aπx/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg dx =/braceleftbigg1 (m−n)πsin/parenleftbiggm−n aπx/parenrightbigg −1 (m+n)πsin/parenleftbiggm+n aπx/parenrightbigg/bracerightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglea 0 =1 π/braceleftbiggsin[(m−n)π] (m−n)−sin[(m+n)π] (m+n)/bracerightbigg =0. Note that this argument does notwork if m=n. (Can you spot the point at which it fails?) In that case normalization tells us that the integral is 1. In fact, we can combine orthogonality and normalization into a single statement: /integraldisplay ψm(x)∗ψn(x)dx=δmn, (2.33) 14To make this symmetry more apparent, some authors center the well at the origin (running it now from −ato+a). The even functions are then cosines, and the odd ones are sines. See Problem 2.36. 15In this case the ψsa r e real, so the complex conjugation (*) of ψmis unnecessary, but for future purposes it’s a good idea to get in the habit of putting it there.34 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation whereδmn(the so-called Kronecker delta ) is deﬁned by δmn=/braceleftBigg 0,m/negationslash=n, 1,m=n.(2.34) We say that the ψsa r e orthonormal . 4.They are complete , in the sense that any other function, f(x), can be expressed as a linear combination of them: f(x)=∞/summationdisplay n=1cnψn(x)=/radicalbigg 2 a∞/summationdisplay n=1cnsin/parenleftBignπ ax/parenrightBig . (2.35) I’m not about to prove the completeness of the functions√2/asin(nπx/a),b u ti f you’ve studied advanced calculus you will recognize that Equation 2.35 is nothing but theFourier series forf(x), and the fact that “any” function can be expanded in this way is sometimes called Dirichlet’s theorem .16 The coefﬁcients cncan be evaluated—for a given f(x)—by a method I call Fourier’s trick , which beautifully exploits the orthonormality of {ψn}: Multiply both sides of Equation 2.35 byψm(x)∗, and integrate. /integraldisplay ψm(x)∗f(x)dx=∞/summationdisplay n=1cn/integraldisplay ψm(x)∗ψn(x)dx=∞/summationdisplay n=1cnδmn=cm. (2.36) (Notice how the Kronecker delta kills every term in the sum except the one for which n=m.) Thus the nth coefﬁcient in the expansion of f(x)is17 cn=/integraldisplay ψn(x)∗f(x)dx. (2.37) These four properties are extremely powerful, and they are not peculiar to the inﬁnite square well. The ﬁrst is true whenever the potential itself is a symmetric function; the second is universal, regardless of the shape of the potential.18Orthogonality is also quite general—I’ll show you the proof in Chapter 3. Completeness holds for all the potentials you are likely to encounter, but the proofs tend to be nasty and laborious; I’m afraid most physicists simply assume completeness, and hope for the best. The stationary states (Equation 2.18) of the inﬁnite square well are /Psi1n(x,t)=/radicalbigg 2 asin/parenleftBignπ ax/parenrightBig e−i(n2π2/planckover2pi1/2ma2)t. (2.38) I claimed (Equation 2.17) that the most general solution to the (time-dependent) Schrödinger equation is a linear combination of stationary states: 16See, for example, Mary Boas, Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences , 3rd edn (New York: John Wiley, 2006), p. 356; f(x)can even have a ﬁnite number of ﬁnite discontinuities. 17It doesn’t matter whether you use mornas the “dummy index” here (as long as you are consistent on the two sides of the equation, of course); whatever letter you use, it just stands for “any positive integer.” 18Problem 2.45 explores this property. For further discussion, see John L. Powell and Bernd Crasemann, Quantum Mechanics (Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1961), Section 5-7.2.2 The Inﬁnite Square Well 35 /Psi1(x,t)=∞/summationdisplay n=1cn/radicalbigg 2 asin/parenleftBignπ ax/parenrightBig e−i(n2π2/planckover2pi1/2ma2)t.

It remains only for me to demon- strate that I can ﬁt any prescribed initial wave function, /Psi1(x,0)by appropriate choice of the coefﬁcients cn: /Psi1(x,0)=∞/summationdisplay n=1cnψn(x). The completeness of the ψs (conﬁrmed in this case by Dirichlet’s theorem) guarantees that I can always express /Psi1(x,0)in this way, and their orthonormality licenses the use of Fourier’s trick to determine the actual coefﬁcients: cn=/radicalbigg 2 a/integraldisplaya 0sin/parenleftBignπ ax/parenrightBig /Psi1(x,0)dx. (2.40) That does it: Given the initial wave function, /Psi1(x,0), we ﬁrst compute the expansion coef- ﬁcients cn, using Equation 2.40, and then plug these into Equation 2.39 to obtain/Psi1(x,t). Armed with the wave function, we are in a position to compute any dynamical quantities of interest, using the procedures in Chapter 1. And this same ritual applies to anypotential—the only things that change are the functional form of the ψs and the equation for the allowed energies. Example 2.2 A particle in the inﬁnite square well has the initial wave function /Psi1(x,0)=Ax(a−x),(0≤x≤a), for some constant A(see Figure 2.3).Outside the well, of course, /Psi1=0. Find/Psi1(x,t).

Example 2.3 Check that Equation 2.20 is satisﬁed, for the wave function in Example 2.2. If you mea- sured the energy of a particle in this state, what is the most probable result? What is the expectation value of the energy? Solution: The starting wave function (Figure 2.3) closely resembles the ground state ψ1 (Figure 2.2).

The rest of the coefﬁcients make up the difference:20 19Loosely speaking, cntells you the “amount of ψnthat is contained in /Psi1.” 20You can look up the series 1 16+1 36+1 56+···=π6 960 and 1 14+1 34+1 54+···=π4 96 in math tables, under “Sums of Reciprocal Powers” or “Riemann Zeta Function.”2.2 The Inﬁnite Square Well 37 ∞/summationdisplay n=1|cn|2=/parenleftBigg 8√ 15 π3/parenrightBigg2∞/summationdisplay n=1,3,5,...1 n6=1.

As one would expect, it is very close to E1(5 in place ofπ2/2≈4.935)—slightly larger , because of the admixture of excited states. Of course, it’s no accident that Equation 2.20 came out right in Example 2.3. Indeed, this follows from the normalization of /Psi1(thecns are independent of time, so I’m going to do the proof for t=0; if this bothers you, you can easily generalize the argument to arbitrary t). 1=/integraldisplay |/Psi1(x,0)|2dx=/integraldisplay/parenleftBigg∞/summationdisplay m=1cmψm(x)/parenrightBigg∗/parenleftBigg∞/summationdisplay n=1cnψn(x)/parenrightBigg dx =∞/summationdisplay m=1∞/summationdisplay n=1c∗ mcn/integraldisplay ψm(x)∗ψn(x)dx =∞/summationdisplay n=1∞/summationdisplay m=1c∗ mcnδmn=∞/summationdisplay n=1|cn|2.

Problem 2.3 Show that there is no acceptable solution to the (time-independent) Schrödinger equation for the inﬁnite square well with E=0o r E<0. (This is a special case of the general theorem in Problem 2.2, but this time do it by explicitly solving the Schrödinger equation, and showing that you cannot satisfy the boundary conditions.) ∗ Problem 2.4 Calculate/angbracketleftx/angbracketright,/angbracketleftbig x2/angbracketrightbig ,/angbracketleftp/angbracketright,/angbracketleftbig p2/angbracketrightbig ,σx, andσp,f o rt h e nth stationary state of the inﬁnite square well. Check that the uncertainty principle is satisﬁed. Which state comes closest to the uncertainty limit?38 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation ∗ Problem 2.5 A particle in the inﬁnite square well has as its initial wave function an even mixture of the ﬁrst two stationary states: /Psi1(x,0)=A[ψ1(x)+ψ2(x)]. (a)Normalize/Psi1(x,0). (That is, ﬁnd A. This is very easy, if you exploit the orthonor- mality ofψ1andψ2. Recall that, having normalized /Psi1att=0, you can rest assured that it stays normalized—if you doubt this, check it explicitly after doing part (b).) (b)Find/Psi1(x,t)and|/Psi1(x,t)|2. Express the latter as a sinusoidal function of time, as in Example 2.1. To simplify the result, let ω≡π2/planckover2pi1/2ma2. (c)Compute/angbracketleftx/angbracketright. Notice that it oscillates in time. What is the angular frequency of the oscillation? What is the amplitude of the oscillation? (If your amplitude is greater than a/2, go directly to jail.) (d)Compute/angbracketleftp/angbracketright. (As Peter Lorre would say, “Do it ze kveek vay, Johnny!”) (e)If you measured the energy of this particle, what values might you get, and what is the probability of getting each of them? Find the expectation value of H. How does it compare with E1andE2? Problem 2.6 Although the overall phase constant of the wave function is of no physical signiﬁcance (it cancels out whenever you calculate a measurable quantity), the relative phase of the coefﬁcients in Equation 2.17 does matter. For example, suppose we change the relative phase of ψ1andψ2in Problem 2.5: /Psi1(x,0)=A/bracketleftBig ψ1(x)+eiφψ2(x)/bracketrightBig , whereφis some constant. Find /Psi1(x,t),|/Psi1(x,t)|2, and/angbracketleftx/angbracketright, and compare your results with what you got before. Study the special cases φ=π/2 andφ=π. (For a graphical exploration of this problem see the applet in footnote 9 of this chapter.) ∗ Problem 2.7 A particle in the inﬁnite square well has the initial wave function /Psi1(x,0)=/braceleftBigg Ax, 0≤x≤a/2, A(a−x),a/2≤x≤a. (a)Sketch/Psi1(x,0), and determine the constant A. (b)Find/Psi1(x,t). (c)What is the probability that a measurement of the energy would yield the value E1? (d)Find the expectation value of the energy, using Equation 2.21.21 21Remember, there is no restriction in principle on the shape of the starting wave function, as long as it is normal- izable. In particular, /Psi1(x,0)need not have a continuous derivative. However, if you try to calculate /angbracketleftH/angbracketrightusing/integraltext /Psi1(x,0)∗ˆH/Psi1(x,0)dxin such a case, you may encounter technical difﬁculties, because the second derivative of /Psi1(x,0)is ill deﬁned. It works in Problem 2.9because the discontinuities occur at the end points, where the wave function is zero anyway. In Problem 2.39 you’ll see how to manage cases like Problem 2.7.2.3 The Harmonic Oscillator 39 Problem 2.8 A particle of mass min the inﬁnite square well (of width a)starts out in the state /Psi1(x,0)=/braceleftBigg A,0≤x≤a/2, 0,a/2≤x≤a, for some constant A,s oi ti s( a t t=0)equally likely to be found at any point in the left half of the well. What is the probability that a measurement of the energy (at some later time t)would yield the value π2/planckover2pi12/2ma2? Problem 2.9 For the wave function in Example 2.2, ﬁnd the expectation value of H, at time t=0, the “old fashioned” way: /angbracketleftH/angbracketright=/integraldisplay /Psi1(x,0)∗ˆH/Psi1(x,0)dx. Compare the result we got in Example 2.3.Note: Because/angbracketleftH/angbracketrightis independent of time, there is no loss of generality in using t=0. 2.3 THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR The paradigm for a classical harmonic oscillator is a mass mattached to a spring of force constant k. The motion is governed by Hooke’s law , F=−kx=md2x dt2 (ignoring friction), and the solution is x(t)=Asin(ωt)+Bcos(ωt), where ω≡/radicalbigg k m(2.42) is the (angular) frequency of oscillation. The potential energy is V(x)=1 2kx2; (2.43) its graph is a parabola. Of course, there’s no such thing as a perfect harmonic oscillator—if you stretch it too far the spring is going to break, and typically Hooke’s law fails long before that point is reached. But practically any potential is approximately parabolic, in the neighborhood of a local minimum (Figure 2.4). Formally, if we expand V(x)in aTaylor series about the minimum: V(x)=V(x0)+V/prime(x0)(x−x0)+1 2V/prime/prime(x0)(x−x0)2+···, subtract V(x0)(you can add a constant to V(x)with impunity, since that doesn’t change the force), recognize that V/prime(x0)=0 (since x0is a minimum), and drop the higher-order terms (which are negligible as long as (x−x0)stays small), we get40 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation V(x) x0 x Figure 2.4: Parabolic approximation (dashed curve) to an arbitrary potential, in the neighborhood of a local minimum. V(x)≈1 2V/prime/prime(x0)(x−x0)2, which describes simple harmonic oscillation (about the point x0), with an effective spring constant k=V/prime/prime(x0). That’s why the simple harmonic oscillator is so important: Virtually any oscillatory motion is approximately simple harmonic, as long as the amplitude is small.22 Thequantum problem is to solve the Schrödinger equation for the potential V(x)=1 2mω2x2(2.44) (it is customary to eliminate the spring constant in favor of the classical frequency, using Equation 2.42). As we have seen, it sufﬁces to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation: −/planckover2pi12 2md2ψ dx2+1 2mω2x2ψ=Eψ. (2.45) In the literature you will ﬁnd two entirely different approaches to this problem. The ﬁrst is a straightforward “brute force” solution to the differential equation, using the power series method ; it has the virtue that the same strategy can be applied to many other potentials (in fact, we’ll use it in Chapter 4to treat the hydrogen atom). The second is a diabolically clever algebraic technique, using so-called ladder operators . I’ll show you the algebraic method ﬁrst, because it is quicker and simpler (and a lot more fun);23if you want to skip the power series method for now, that’s ﬁne, but you should certainly plan to study it at some stage. 2.3.1 Algebraic Method To begin with, let’s rewrite Equation 2.45 in a more suggestive form: 1 2m/bracketleftBig ˆp2+(mωx)2/bracketrightBig ψ=Eψ, (2.46) 22Note that V/prime/prime(x0)≥0, since by assumption x0is aminimum .O n l yi nt h er a r ec a s e V/prime/prime(x0)=0 is the oscillation not even approximately simple harmonic. 23We’ll encounter some of the same strategies in the theory of angular momentum (Chapter 4), and the technique generalizes to a broad class of potentials in supersymmetric quantum mechanics (Problem 3.47; see also Richard W. Robinett, Quantum Mechanics (Oxford University Press, New York, 1997), Section 14.4).2.3 The Harmonic Oscillator 41 whereˆp≡−i/planckover2pi1d/dxis the momentum operator.24The basic idea is to factor the Hamiltonian, ˆH=1 2m/bracketleftBig ˆp2+(mωx)2/bracketrightBig . (2.47) If these were numbers , it would be easy: u2+v2=(iu+v)(−iu+v). Here, however, it’s not quite so simple, because ˆpandxareoperators , and operators do not, in general, commute(xˆpis not the same as ˆpx, as we’ll see in a moment—though you might want to stop right now and think it through for yourself). Still, this does motivate us to examine the quantities ˆa±≡1√ 2/planckover2pi1mω/parenleftbig ∓iˆp+mωx/parenrightbig (2.48) (the factor in front is just there to make the ﬁnal results look nicer). Well, what isthe productˆa−ˆa+? ˆa−ˆa+=1 2/planckover2pi1mω/parenleftbig iˆp+mωx/parenrightbig/parenleftbig −iˆp+mωx/parenrightbig =1 2/planckover2pi1mω/bracketleftBig ˆp2+(mωx)2−imω/parenleftbig xˆp−ˆpx/parenrightbig/bracketrightBig . As anticipated, there’s an extra term, involving/parenleftbig xˆp−ˆpx/parenrightbig . We call this the commutator of xandˆp; it is a measure of how badly they failto commute. In general, the commutator of operatorsˆAandˆB(written with square brackets) is /bracketleftBig ˆA,ˆB/bracketrightBig ≡ˆAˆB−ˆBˆA. (2.49) In this notation, ˆa−ˆa+=1 2/planckover2pi1mω/bracketleftBig ˆp2+(mωx)2/bracketrightBig −i 2/planckover2pi1/bracketleftbig x,ˆp/bracketrightbig . (2.50) We need to ﬁgure out the commutator of xandˆp.Warning: Operators are notoriously slippery to work with in the abstract, and you are bound to make mistakes unless you give them a “test function,” f(x), to act on. At the end you can throw away the test function, and you’ll be left with an equation involving the operators alone. In the present case we have: /bracketleftbig x,ˆp/bracketrightbig f(x)=/bracketleftbigg x(−i/planckover2pi1)d dx(f)−(−i/planckover2pi1)d dx(xf)/bracketrightbigg =−i/planckover2pi1/parenleftbigg xdf dx−xdf dx−f/parenrightbigg =i/planckover2pi1f(x). (2.51) Dropping the test function, which has served its purpose, /bracketleftbig x,ˆp/bracketrightbig =i/planckover2pi1. (2.52) This lovely and ubiquitous formula is known as the canonical commutation relation .25 24P u tah a to n x, too, if you like, but since ˆx=xwe usually leave it off. 25In a deep sense all of the mysteries of quantum mechanics can be traced to the fact that position and momentum do not commute. Indeed, some authors take the canonical commutation relation as an axiom of the theory, and use it toderiveˆp=−i/planckover2pi1d/dx.42 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation With this, Equation 2.50 becomes ˆa−ˆa+=1 /planckover2pi1ωˆH+1 2, (2.53) or ˆH=/planckover2pi1ω/parenleftbigg ˆa−ˆa+−1 2/parenrightbigg . (2.54) Evidently the Hamiltonian does notfactor perfectly—there’s that extra −1/2 on the right. Notice that the ordering of ˆa+andˆa−is important here; the same argument, with ˆa+on the left, yields ˆa+ˆa−=1 /planckover2pi1ωˆH−1 (2.55) In particular,/bracketleftbig ˆa−,ˆa+/bracketrightbig =1. (2.56) Meanwhile, the Hamiltonian can equally well be written ˆH=/planckover2pi1ω/parenleftbigg ˆa+ˆa−+1 2/parenrightbigg . (2.57) In terms ofˆa±, then, the Schrödinger equation26for the harmonic oscillator takes the form /planckover2pi1ω/parenleftbigg ˆa±ˆa∓±1 2/parenrightbigg ψ=Eψ (2.58) (in equations like this you read the upper signs all the way across, or else the lower signs). Now, here comes the crucial step: I claim that: Ifψsatisﬁes the Schrödinger equation with energy E(that is:ˆHψ= Eψ), thenˆa+ψsatisﬁes the Schrödinger equation with energy (E+ /planckover2pi1ω):ˆH/parenleftbig ˆa+ψ/parenrightbig =(E+/planckover2pi1ω)/parenleftbig ˆa+ψ/parenrightbig . Proof: ˆH/parenleftbig ˆa+ψ/parenrightbig =/planckover2pi1ω/parenleftbigg ˆa+ˆa−+1 2/parenrightbigg/parenleftbig ˆa+ψ/parenrightbig =/planckover2pi1ω/parenleftbigg ˆa+ˆa−ˆa++1 2ˆa+/parenrightbigg ψ =/planckover2pi1ωˆa+/parenleftbigg ˆa−ˆa++1 2/parenrightbigg ψ=ˆa+/bracketleftbigg /planckover2pi1ω/parenleftbigg ˆa+ˆa−+1+1 2/parenrightbigg ψ/bracketrightbigg =ˆa+/parenleftBig ˆH+/planckover2pi1ω/parenrightBig ψ=ˆa+(E+/planckover2pi1ω)ψ=(E+/planckover2pi1ω)/parenleftbig ˆa+ψ/parenrightbig .QED (I used Equation 2.56 to replaceˆa−ˆa+by/parenleftbig ˆa+ˆa−+1/parenrightbig in the second line. Notice that whereas the ordering of ˆa+andˆa−does matter, the ordering of ˆa±and any constants — such as /planckover2pi1,ω, and E—does not; an operator commutes with any constant.) By the same token, ˆa−ψis a solution with energy (E−/planckover2pi1ω): ˆH/parenleftbig ˆa−ψ/parenrightbig =/planckover2pi1ω/parenleftbigg ˆa−ˆa+−1 2/parenrightbigg/parenleftbig ˆa−ψ/parenrightbig =/planckover2pi1ωˆa−/parenleftbigg ˆa+ˆa−−1 2/parenrightbigg ψ =ˆa−/bracketleftbigg /planckover2pi1ω/parenleftbigg ˆa−ˆa+−1−1 2/parenrightbigg ψ/bracketrightbigg =ˆa−/parenleftBig ˆH−/planckover2pi1ω/parenrightBig ψ=ˆa−(E−/planckover2pi1ω)ψ =(E−/planckover2pi1ω)/parenleftbig ˆa−ψ/parenrightbig . 26I’m getting tired of writing “time-independent Schrödinger equation,” so when it’s clear from the context which one I mean, I’ll just call it the “Schrödinger equation.”2.3 The Harmonic Oscillator 43 â+ψâ2 +ψâ3 +ψ ψ â_2ψâ_ψE â_ω E+2E+3 ω E+ω ψ0E0E E−2ωE−ωâ+ hhhhh Figure 2.5: The “ladder” of states for the harmonic oscillator. Here, then, is a wonderful machine for generating new solutions, with higher and lower energies—if we could just ﬁnd onesolution, to get started! We call ˆa±ladder operators , because they allow us to climb up and down in energy; ˆa+is the raising operator , andˆa−the lowering operator . The “ladder” of states is illustrated in Figure 2.5. But wait! What if I apply the lowering operator repeatedly? Eventually I’m going to reach a state with energy less than zero, which (according to the general theorem in Problem 2.3) does not exist! At some point the machine must fail. How can that happen? We know that ˆa−ψis a new solution to the Schrödinger equation, but there is no guarantee that it will be normalizable —it might be zero, or its square-integral might be inﬁnite. In practice it is the former: There occurs a “lowest rung” (call it ψ0)such that ˆa−ψ0=0. (2.59) We can use this to determine ψ0(x): 1√ 2/planckover2pi1mω/parenleftbigg /planckover2pi1d dx+mωx/parenrightbigg ψ0=0, or dψ0 dx=−mω /planckover2pi1xψ0.44 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation This differential equation is easy to solve: /integraldisplaydψ0 ψ0=−mω /planckover2pi1/integraldisplay xd x⇒ lnψ0=−mω 2/planckover2pi1x2+constant, so ψ0(x)=Ae−mω 2/planckover2pi1x2. We might as well normalize it right away: 1=|A|2/integraldisplay∞ −∞e−mωx2//planckover2pi1dx=|A|2/radicalbigg π/planckover2pi1 mω, soA2=√mω/π/planckover2pi1, and hence ψ0(x)=/parenleftBigmω π/planckover2pi1/parenrightBig1/4 e−mω 2/planckover2pi1x2. (2.60) To determine the energy of this state we plug it into the Schrödinger equation (in the form of Equation 2.58),/planckover2pi1ω/parenleftbig ˆa+ˆa−+1/2/parenrightbig ψ0=E0ψ0, and exploit the fact that ˆa−ψ0=0: E0=1 2/planckover2pi1ω. (2.61) With our foot now securely planted on the bottom rung (the ground state of the quantum oscillator), we simply apply the raising operator (repeatedly) to generate the excited states,27 increasing the energy by /planckover2pi1ωwith each step: ψn(x)=An/parenleftbig ˆa+/parenrightbignψ0(x),with En=/parenleftbigg n+1 2/parenrightbigg /planckover2pi1ω, (2.62) where Anis the normalization constant. By applying the raising operator (repeatedly) to ψ0, then, we can (in principle) construct all28the stationary states of the harmonic oscillator. Meanwhile, without ever doing that explicitly, we have determined the allowed energies! Example 2.4 Find the ﬁrst excited state of the harmonic oscillator. Solution: Using Equation 2.62, ψ1(x)=A1ˆa+ψ0=A1√ 2/planckover2pi1mω/parenleftbigg −/planckover2pi1d dx+mωx/parenrightbigg/parenleftBigmω π/planckover2pi1/parenrightBig1/4 e−mω 2/planckover2pi1x2 =A1/parenleftBigmω π/planckover2pi1/parenrightBig1/4/radicalbigg 2mω /planckover2pi1xe−mω 2/planckover2pi1x2. (2.63) 27In the case of the harmonic oscillator it is customary, for some reason, to depart from the usual practice, and number the states starting with n=0, instead of n=1. Of course, the lower limit on the sum in a formula such as Equation 2.17 should be altered accordingly. 28Note that we obtain allthe (normalizable) solutions by this procedure. For if there were some other solution, we could generate from it a second ladder, by repeated application of the raising and lowering operators. But the bottom rung of this new ladder would have to satisfy Equation 2.59, and since that leads inexorably to Equation 2.60, the bottom rungs would be the same, and hence the two ladders would in fact be identical.2.3 The Harmonic Oscillator 45 We can normalize it “by hand”: /integraldisplay |ψ1|2dx=|A1|2/radicalbiggmω π/planckover2pi1/parenleftbigg2mω /planckover2pi1/parenrightbigg/integraldisplay∞ −∞x2e−mω /planckover2pi1x2dx=|A1|2, so, as it happens, A1=1. I wouldn’t want to calculate ψ50this way (applying the raising operator ﬁfty times!), but never mind: In principle Equation 2.62 does the job—except for the normalization. You can even get the normalization algebraically, but it takes some fancy footwork, so watch closely. We know that ˆa±ψnisproportional toψn±1, ˆa+ψn=cnψn+1,ˆa−ψn=dnψn−1 (2.64) but what are the proportionality factors, cnanddn?

(2.67) Thus ψ1=ˆa+ψ0,ψ 2=1√ 2ˆa+ψ1=1√ 2/parenleftbig ˆa+/parenrightbig2ψ0, ψ3=1√ 3ˆa+ψ2=1√ 3·2/parenleftbig ˆa+/parenrightbig3ψ0,ψ 4=1√ 4ˆa+ψ3=1√ 4·3·2/parenleftbig ˆa+/parenrightbig4ψ0, and so on.

As in the case of the inﬁnite square well, the stationary states of the harmonic oscillator are orthogonal: /integraldisplay∞ −∞ψ∗ mψndx=δmn.

Orthonormality means that we can again use Fourier’s trick (Equation 2.37) to evaluate the coefﬁcients cn, when we expand /Psi1(x,0)as a linear combination of stationary states (Equation 2.16). As always,|cn|2is the probability that a measurement of the energy would yield the value En. 30Of course, we could multiply cnanddnby phase factors, amounting to a different deﬁnition of theψn; but this choice keeps the wave functions real.2.3 The Harmonic Oscillator 47 Example 2.5 Find the expectation value of the potential energy in the nth stationary state of the harmonic oscillator. Solution: /angbracketleftV/angbracketright=/angbracketleftbigg1 2mω2x2/angbracketrightbigg =1 2mω2/integraldisplay∞ −∞ψ∗ nx2ψndx. There’s a beautiful device for evaluating integrals of this kind (involving powers of xorˆp): Use the deﬁnition (Equation 2.48) to express xandˆpin terms of the raising and lowering operators: x=/radicalbigg /planckover2pi1 2mω/parenleftbig ˆa++ˆa−/parenrightbig ;ˆp=i/radicalbigg /planckover2pi1mω 2/parenleftbig ˆa+−ˆa−/parenrightbig . (2.70) In this example we are interested in x2: x2=/planckover2pi1 2mω/bracketleftBig/parenleftbig ˆa+/parenrightbig2+/parenleftbig ˆa+ˆa−/parenrightbig +/parenleftbig ˆa−ˆa+/parenrightbig +/parenleftbig ˆa−/parenrightbig2/bracketrightBig .

But/parenleftbig ˆa+/parenrightbig2ψnis (apart from normalization) ψn+2, which is orthogonal to ψn, and the same goes for/parenleftbig ˆa−/parenrightbig2ψn, which is proportional to ψn−2. So those terms drop out, and we can use Equation 2.66 to evaluate the remaining two: /angbracketleftV/angbracketright=/planckover2pi1ω 4(n+n+1)=1 2/planckover2pi1ω/parenleftbigg n+1 2/parenrightbigg . As it happens, the expectation value of the potential energy is exactly half the total (the other half, of course, is kinetic). This is a peculiarity of the harmonic oscillator, as we’ll see later on (Problem 3.37). ∗ Problem 2.10 (a)Constructψ2(x). (b)Sketchψ0,ψ1, andψ2.

Things look a little cleaner if we introduce the dimensionless variable ξ≡/radicalbiggmω /planckover2pi1x; (2.72) in terms ofξthe Schrödinger equation reads d2ψ dξ2=/parenleftBig ξ2−K/parenrightBig ψ, (2.73) where Kis the energy, in units of (1/2)/planckover2pi1ω: K≡2E /planckover2pi1ω. (2.74) Our problem is to solve Equation 2.73, and in the process obtain the “allowed” values of K (and hence of E). To begin with, note that at very large ξ(which is to say, at very large x),ξ2completely dominates over the constant K,s oi nt h i sr e g i m e d2ψ dξ2≈ξ2ψ, (2.75) which has the approximate solution (check it!) ψ(ξ)≈Ae−ξ2/2+Be+ξ2/2. (2.76) The Bterm is clearly not normalizable (it blows up as |x|→∞); the physically acceptable solutions, then, have the asymptotic form 31However,/angbracketleftx/angbracketrightdoes oscillate at the classical frequency—see Problem 3.40.2.3 The Harmonic Oscillator 49 ψ(ξ)→()e−ξ2/2,at largeξ. (2.77) This suggests that we “peel off” the exponential part, ψ(ξ)=h(ξ)e−ξ2/2, (2.78) in hopes that what remains, h(ξ), has a simpler functional form than ψ(ξ)itself.32Differenti- ating Equation 2.78, dψ dξ=/parenleftbiggdh dξ−ξh/parenrightbigg e−ξ2/2, and d2ψ dξ2=/parenleftbiggd2h dξ2−2ξdh dξ+(ξ2−1)h/parenrightbigg e−ξ2/2, so the Schrödinger equation (Equation 2.73) becomes d2h dξ2−2ξdh dξ+(K−1)h=0. (2.79) I propose to look for solutions to Equation 2.79 in the form of power series inξ:33 h(ξ)=a0+a1ξ+a2ξ2+···=∞/summationdisplay j=0ajξj. (2.80) Differentiating the series term by term, dh dξ=a1+2a2ξ+3a3ξ2+···=∞/summationdisplay j=0jajξj−1, and d2h dξ2=2a2+2·3a3ξ+3·4a4ξ2+···=∞/summationdisplay j=0(j+1)(j+2)aj+2ξj. Putting these into Equation 2.80, we ﬁnd ∞/summationdisplay j=0/bracketleftbig (j+1)(j+2)aj+2−2jaj+(K−1)aj/bracketrightbig ξj=0. (2.81) It follows (from the uniqueness of power series expansions34) that the coefﬁcient of each power ofξmust vanish, (j+1)(j+2)aj+2−2jaj+(K−1)aj=0, 32Note that although we invoked some approximations to motivate Equation 2.78, what follows is exact . The device of stripping off the asymptotic behavior is the standard ﬁrst step in the power series method for solving differential equations—see, for example, Boas (footnote 16), Chapter 12. 33According to Taylor’s theorem, anyreasonably well-behaved function can be expressed as a power series, so Equation 2.80 ordinarily involves no loss of generality. For conditions on the applicability of the method, see Boas (footnote 16) or George B. Arfken and Hans-Jurgen Weber, Mathematical Methods for Physicists , 7th edn, Academic Press, Orlando (2013), Section 7.5. 34See, for example, Arfken and Weber (footnote 33), Section 1.2.50 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation and hence that aj+2=(2j+1−K) (j+1)(j+2)aj. (2.82) This recursion formula is entirely equivalent to the Schrödinger equation. Starting with a0, it generates all the even-numbered coefﬁcients: a2=(1−K) 2a0,a4=(5−K) 12a2=(5−K)(1−K) 24a0,. . . , and starting with a1, it generates the odd coefﬁcients: a3=(3−K) 6a1,a5=(7−K) 20a3=(7−K)(3−K) 120a1,. . . . We write the complete solution as h(ξ)=heven(ξ)+hodd(ξ), (2.83) where heven(ξ)≡a0+a2ξ2+a4ξ4+··· is an even function of ξ, built on a0, and hodd(ξ)≡a1ξ+a3ξ3+a5ξ5+··· is an odd function, built on a1. Thus Equation 2.82 determines h(ξ)in terms of two arbitrary constants(a0and a1)—which is just what we would expect, for a second-order differential equation. However, not all the solutions so obtained are normalizable . For at very large j,t h e recursion formula becomes (approximately) aj+2≈2 jaj, with the (approximate) solution aj≈C (j/2)!, for some constant C, and this yields (at large ξ, where the higher powers dominate) h(ξ)≈C/summationdisplay 1 (j/2)!ξj≈C/summationdisplay1 j!ξ2j≈Ceξ2. Now, if hgoes like exp/parenleftbig ξ2/parenrightbig , thenψ(rememberψ?—that’s what we’re trying to calculate) goes like exp/parenleftbig ξ2/2/parenrightbig (Equation 2.78), which is precisely the asymptotic behavior we didn’t want.35 There is only one way to wiggle out of this: For normalizable solutions the power series must terminate . There must occur some “highest” j(call it n), such that the recursion formula spits outan+2=0 (this will truncate either the series hevenorthe series hodd;t h e other one must be zero from the start: a1=0i fnis even, and a0=0i fnis odd). For physically acceptable solutions, then, Equation 2.82 requires that K=2n+1, 35It’s no surprise that the ill-behaved solutions are still contained in Equation 2.82; this recursion relation is equivalent to the Schrödinger equation, so it’s gotto include both the asymptotic forms we found in Equation 2.76.2.3 The Harmonic Oscillator 51 for some positive integer n, which is to say (referring to Equation 2.74) that the energy must be En=/parenleftbigg n+1 2/parenrightbigg /planckover2pi1ω, forn=0,1,2,.... (2.84) Thus we recover, by a completely different method, the fundamental quantization condition we found algebraically in Equation 2.62. It seems at ﬁrst rather surprising that the quantization of energy should emerge from a technical detail in the power series solution to the Schrödinger equation, but let’s look at it from a different perspective. Equation 2.71 has solutions, of course, for anyvalue of E(in fact, it has twolinearly independent solutions for every E). But almost all of these solutions blow up exponentially at large x, and hence are not normalizable. Imagine, for example, using an Ethat is slightly lessthan one of the allowed values (say, 0 .49/planckover2pi1ω), and plotting the solution: Figure 2.6(a). Now try an Eslightly larger (say, 0.51/planckover2pi1ω); the “tail” now blows up in the other direction (Figure 2.6(b)). As you tweak the parameter in tiny increments from 0.49 to 0.51, the graph “ﬂips over” at precisely the value 0.5—only here does the solution escape the exponential asymptotic growth that renders it physically unacceptable.36 −4 −2 2 411.52 0.5 −0.5 −1 −1.5 −2ξ(b)−4 −2 2 411.52 0.5 −0.5 −1 −1.5 −2ξ(a) Figure 2.6: Solutions to the Schrödinger equation for (a) E=0.49/planckover2pi1ω,a n d( b ) E=0.51/planckover2pi1ω. 36It is possible to set this up on a computer, and discover the allowed energies “experimentally.” You might call it the wag the dog method: When the tail wags, you know you’ve just passed over an allowed value. Computer scientists call it the shooting method (Nicholas Giordano, Computational Physics , Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ (1997), Section 10.2). See Problems 2.55– 2.57.52 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation Table 2.1: The ﬁrst few Hermite polynomials, H n(ξ). For the allowed values of K, the recursion formula reads aj+2=−2(n−j) (j+1)(j+2)aj. (2.85) Ifn=0, there is only one term in the series (we must pick a1=0t ok i l l hodd, and j=0i n Equation 2.85 yields a2=0): h0(ξ)=a0, and hence ψ0(ξ)=a0e−ξ2/2 (which, apart from the normalization, reproduces Equation 2.60). For n=1w et a k e a0=0,37 and Equation 2.85 with j=1 yields a3=0, so h1(ξ)=a1ξ, and hence ψ1(ξ)=a1ξe−ξ2/2 (conﬁrming Equation 2.63). For n=2,j=0 yields a2=−2a0, and j=2g i v e s a4=0, so h2(ξ)=a0/parenleftBig 1−2ξ2/parenrightBig , and ψ2(ξ)=a0/parenleftBig 1−2ξ2/parenrightBig e−ξ2/2, and so on. (Compare Problem 2.10, where this last result was obtained by algebraic means). In general, hn(ξ)will be a polynomial of degree ninξ, involving even powers only, if nis an even integer, and odd powers only, if nis an odd integer. Apart from the overall factor (a0 ora1)they are the so-called Hermite polynomials ,Hn(ξ).38The ﬁrst few of them are listed in Table 2.1. By tradition, the arbitrary multiplicative factor is chosen so that the coefﬁcient of the highest power of ξis 2n. With this convention, the normalized39stationary states for the harmonic oscillator are ψn(x)=/parenleftBigmω π/planckover2pi1/parenrightBig1/41√ 2nn!Hn(ξ)e−ξ2/2. (2.86) They are identical (of course) to the ones we obtained algebraically in Equation 2.68. 37Note that there is a completely different set of coefﬁcients ajfor each value of n. 38The Hermite polynomials have been studied extensively in the mathematical literature, and there are many tools and tricks for working with them. A few of these are explored in Problem 2.16. 39I shall not work out the normalization constant here; if you are interested in knowing how it is done, see for example Leonard Schiff, Quantum Mechanics , 3rd edn, McGraw-Hill, New York (1968), Section 13.2.3 The Harmonic Oscillator 53 In Figure 2.7(a) I have plotted ψn(x)for the ﬁrst few ns. The quantum oscillator is strikingly different from its classical counterpart—not only are the energies quantized, but the position distributions have some bizarre features. For instance, the probability of ﬁnding the particle outside the classically allowed range (that is, with xgreater than the classical amplitude for 0.00.040.060.120.160.200.24 ⏐ψ60(x)⏐2 x(b)ψn(x) x0⏐ψn(x)⏐2 x0n = 0n = 1n = 2n = 3 Potential(a) Figure 2.7: (a) The ﬁrst four stationary states of the harmonic oscillator. (b) Graph of |ψ60|2, with the classical distribution (dashed curve) superimposed.54 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation the energy in question) is notzero (see Problem 2.14), and in all odd states the probability of ﬁnding the particle at the center is zero. Only at large ndo we begin to see some resemblance to the classical case. In Figure 2.7(b) I have superimposed the classical position distribution (Problem 1.11) on the quantum one (for n=60); if you smoothed out the bumps, the two would ﬁt pretty well. Problem 2.14 In the ground state of the harmonic oscillator, what is the probability (correct to three signiﬁcant digits) of ﬁnding the particle outside the classically allowed region? Hint: Classically, the energy of an oscillator is E=(1/2)ka2=(1/2)mω2a2, where a is the amplitude. So the “classically allowed region” for an oscillator of energy Eextends from−/radicalbig 2E/mω2to+/radicalbig 2E/mω2. Look in a math table under “Normal Distribution” or “Error Function” for the numerical value of the integral, or evaluate it by computer. Problem 2.15 Use the recursion formula (Equation 2.85) to work out H5(ξ)andH6(ξ). Invoke the convention that the coefﬁcient of the highest power of ξis 2nto ﬁx the overall constant. ∗∗ Problem 2.16 In this problem we explore some of the more useful theorems (stated without proof) involving Hermite polynomials. (a)TheRodrigues formula says that Hn(ξ)=(−1)neξ2/parenleftbiggd dξ/parenrightbiggn e−ξ2. (2.87) U s ei tt od e r i v e H3andH4. (b)The following recursion relation gives you Hn+1in terms of the two preceding Hermite polynomials: Hn+1(ξ)=2ξHn(ξ)−2nHn−1(ξ). (2.88) Use it, together with your answer in (a), to obtain H5andH6. (c)If you differentiate an nth-order polynomial, you get a polynomial of order (n−1). For the Hermite polynomials, in fact, dHn dξ=2nHn−1(ξ). (2.89) Check this, by differentiating H5andH6. (d)Hn(ξ)is the nthz-derivative, at z= 0, of the generating function exp/parenleftbig −z2+2zξ/parenrightbig ; or, to put it another way, it is the coefﬁcient of zn/n!in the Taylor series expansion for this function: e−z2+2zξ=∞/summationdisplay n=0zn n!Hn(ξ). (2.90) Use this to obtain H1,H2, and H3.2.4 The Free Particle 55 2.4 THE FREE PARTICLE We turn next to what should have been the simplest case of all: the free particle (V(x)=0 everywhere). Classically this would just be motion at constant velocity, but in quantum mechanics the problem is surprisingly subtle. The time-independent Schrödinger equation reads −/planckover2pi12 2md2ψ dx2=Eψ, (2.91) or d2ψ dx2=−k2ψ, where k≡√ 2mE /planckover2pi1. (2.92) So far, it’s the same as inside the inﬁnite square well (Equation 2.24), where the potential is also zero; this time, however, I prefer to write the general solution in exponential form (instead of sines and cosines), for reasons that will appear in due course: ψ(x)=Aeikx+Be−ikx. (2.93) Unlike the inﬁnite square well, there are no boundary conditions to restrict the possible values ofk(and hence of E); the free particle can carry any(positive) energy. Tacking on the standard time dependence, exp (−iEt//planckover2pi1), /Psi1(x,t)=Aeik/parenleftBig x−/planckover2pi1k 2mt/parenrightBig +Be−ik/parenleftBig x+/planckover2pi1k 2mt/parenrightBig . (2.94) Now, anyfunction of xandtthat depends on these variables in the special combination (x±vt)(for some constant v)represents a wave of unchanging shape, traveling in the ∓x- direction at speed v: A ﬁxed point on the waveform (for example, a maximum or a minimum) corresponds to a ﬁxed value of the argument, and hence to xandtsuch that x±vt=constant,orx=∓vt+constant. Since every point on the waveform moves with the same velocity, its shape doesn’t change as it propagates. Thus the ﬁrst term in Equation 2.94 represents a wave traveling to the right , and the second represents a wave (of the same energy) going to the left. By the way, since they only differ by the sign in front of k, we might as well write /Psi1k(x,t)=Aei/parenleftBig kx−/planckover2pi1k2 2mt/parenrightBig , (2.95) and let krun negative to cover the case of waves traveling to the left: k≡±√ 2mE /planckover2pi1,with/braceleftBigg k>0⇒ traveling to the right , k<0⇒ traveling to the left .(2.96) Evidently the “stationary states” of the free particle are propagating waves; their wavelength is λ=2π/|k|, and, according to the de Broglie formula (Equation 1.39), they carry momentum p=/planckover2pi1k. (2.97) The speed of these waves (the coefﬁcient of tover the coefﬁcient of x)is vquantum=/planckover2pi1|k| 2m=/radicalbigg E 2m. (2.98)56 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation On the other hand, the classical speed of a free particle with energy Eis given by E= (1/2)mv2(pure kinetic, since V=0),s o vclassical=/radicalbigg 2E m=2vquantum. (2.99) Apparently the quantum mechanical wave function travels at half the speed of the particle it is supposed to represent! We’ll return to this paradox in a moment—there is an even more serious problem we need to confront ﬁrst: This wave function is not normalizable : /integraldisplay+∞ −∞/Psi1∗ k/Psi1kdx=|A|2/integraldisplay+∞ −∞dx=|A|2(∞). (2.100) In the case of the free particle, then, the separable solutions do not represent physically realiz- able states. A free particle cannot exist in a stationary state; or, to put it another way, there is no such thing as a free particle with a deﬁnite energy . But that doesn’t mean the separable solutions are of no use to us. For they play a mathe- matical role that is entirely independent of their physical interpretation: The general solution to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation is still a linear combination of separable solutions (only this time it’s an integral over the continuous variable k, instead of a sumover the discrete index n): /Psi1(x,t)=1√ 2π/integraldisplay+∞ −∞φ(k)ei(kx−/planckover2pi1k2 2mt)dk. (2.101) (The quantity 1 /√ 2πis factored out for convenience; what plays the role of the coefﬁcient cnin Equation 2.17 is the combination/parenleftBig 1/√ 2π/parenrightBig φ(k)dk.) Now thiswave function canbe normalized (for appropriate φ(k)). But it necessarily carries a range ofks, and hence a range of energies and speeds. We call it a wave packet .40 In the generic quantum problem, we are given/Psi1(x,0), and we are asked to ﬁnd/Psi1(x,t). For a free particle the solution takes the form of Equation 2.101 ; the only question is how to determineφ(k)so as to match the initial wave function: /Psi1(x,0)=1√ 2π/integraldisplay+∞ −∞φ(k)eikxdk. (2.102) This is a classic problem in Fourier analysis; the answer is provided by Plancherel’s theorem (see Problem 2.19): f(x)=1√ 2π/integraldisplay+∞ −∞F(k)eikxdk⇐⇒ F(k)=1√ 2π/integraldisplay+∞ −∞f(x)e−ikxdx. (2.103) F(k)is called the Fourier transform off(x);f(x)is the inverse Fourier transform ofF(k) (the only difference is the sign in the exponent).41There is, of course, some restriction on the 40Sinusoidal waves extend out to inﬁnity, and they are not normalizable. But superpositions of such waves lead to interference, which allows for localization and normalizability. 41Some people deﬁne the Fourier transform without the factor of 1 /√ 2π. Then the inverse transform becomes f(x)=(1/2π)/integraltext∞ −∞F(k)eikxdk, spoiling the symmetry of the two formulas.2.4 The Free Particle 57 allowable functions: The integrals have to exist.42For our purposes this is guaranteed by the physical requirement that /Psi1(x,0)itself be normalized. So the solution to the generic quantum problem, for the free particle, is Equation 2.101 , with φ(k)=1√ 2π/integraldisplay+∞ −∞/Psi1(x,0)e−ikxdx. (2.104) Example 2.6 A free particle, which is initially localized in the range −a<x<a, is released at time t=0: /Psi1(x,0)=/braceleftBigg A,−a<x<a, 0,otherwise, where Aandaare positive real constants. Find /Psi1(x,t). Solution: First we need to normalize /Psi1(x,0): 1=/integraldisplay∞ −∞|/Psi1(x,0)|2dx=|A|2/integraldisplaya −adx=2a|A|2⇒A=1√ 2a. Next we calculate φ(k), using Equation 2.104 : φ(k)=1√ 2π1√ 2a/integraldisplaya −ae−ikxdx=1 2√πae−ikx −ik/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglea −a =1 k√πa/parenleftbiggeika−e−ika 2i/parenrightbigg =1√πasin(ka) k. Finally, we plug this back into Equation 2.101 : /Psi1(x,t)=1 π√ 2a/integraldisplay∞ −∞sin(ka) kei/parenleftBig kx−/planckover2pi1k2 2mt/parenrightBig dk. (2.105) Unfortunately, this integral cannot be solved in terms of elementary functions, though it can of course be evaluated numerically (Figure 2.8). (There are, in fact, precious few cases in which the integral for /Psi1(x,t)(Equation 2.101 )canbe carried out explicitly; see Problem 2.21 for a particularly beautiful example.) In Figure 2.9I have plotted/Psi1(x,0)andφ(k). Note that for small a,/Psi1(x,0)is narrow (inx), whileφ(k)is broad (in k), and vice versa for large a.B u t kis related to momentum, by Equation 2.97, so this is a manifestation of the uncertainty principle: the position can be well deﬁned (small a), or the momentum (large a), but not both. 42The necessary and sufﬁcient condition on f(x)is that/integraltext∞ −∞|f(x)|2dxbeﬁnite . (In that case/integraltext∞ −∞|F(k)|2dk is also ﬁnite, and in fact the two integrals are equal. Some people call this Plancherel’s theorem, leaving Equation 2.102 without a name.)

I return now to the paradox noted earlier: the fact that the separable solution /Psi1k(x,t)trav- els at the “wrong” speed for the particle it ostensibly represents. Strictly speaking, the problem evaporated when we discovered that /Psi1kis not a physically realizable state. Nevertheless, it is of interest to ﬁgure out how information about the particle velocity iscontained in the wave function (Equation 2.101 ). The essential idea is this: A wave packet is a superposition of sinu- soidal functions whose amplitude is modulated by φ(Figure 2.10); it consists of “ripples” contained within an “envelope.” What corresponds to the particle velocity is not the speed of the individual ripples (the so-called phase velocity ), but rather the speed of the envelope (the group velocity )—which, depending on the nature of the waves, can be greater than, less than, or equal to, the velocity of the ripples that go to make it up. For waves on a string, the group velocity is the same as the phase velocity. For water waves it is one-half the phase velocity, as you may have noticed when you toss a rock into a pond (if you concentrate on a particular ripple, you will see it build up from the rear, move forward through the group, and fade away at the front, while the group as a whole propagates out at half that speed). What I need to show is that for the wave function of a free particle in quantum mechanics the group velocity is twice the phase velocity—just right to match the classical particle speed. The problem, then, is to determine the group velocity of a wave packet with the generic form2.4 The Free Particle 59 xυg υp Figure 2.10: A wave packet. The “envelope” travels at the group velocity; the “ripples” travel at the phase velocity. /Psi1(x,t)=1√ 2π/integraldisplay+∞ −∞φ(k)ei(kx−ωt)dk. (2.106) In our caseω=/parenleftbig /planckover2pi1k2/2m/parenrightbig , but what I have to say now applies to anykind of wave packet, regardless of its dispersion relation (the formula for ωas a function of k). Let us assume thatφ(k)is narrowly peaked about some particular value k0. (There is nothing illegal about a broad spread in k, but such wave packets change shape rapidly—different components travel at different speeds, so the whole notion of a “group,” with a well-deﬁned velocity, loses its meaning.) Since the integrand is negligible except in the vicinity of k0, we may as well Taylor- expand the function ω(k)about that point, and keep only the leading terms: ω(k)≈ω0+ω/prime 0(k−k0), whereω/prime 0is the derivative of ωwith respect to k, at the point k0. Changing variables from ktos≡k−k0(to center the integral at k0),w eh a v e /Psi1(x,t)≈1√ 2π/integraldisplay+∞ −∞φ(k0+s)ei[(k0+s)x−(ω0+ω/prime 0s)t]ds =1√ 2πei(k0x−ω0t)/integraldisplay+∞ −∞φ(k0+s)eis(x−ω/prime 0t)ds. (2.107) The term in front is a sinusoidal wave (the “ripples”), traveling at speed ω0/k0. It is modulated by the integral (the “envelope”), which is a function of x−ω/prime 0t, and therefore propagates at the speedω/prime Thus the phase velocity is vphase=ω k, (2.108) while the group velocity is vgroup=dω dk(2.109) (both of them evaluated at k=k0). In our case,ω=/parenleftbig /planckover2pi1k2/2m/parenrightbig ,s oω/k=(/planckover2pi1k/2m), whereas dω/dk=(/planckover2pi1k/m), which is twice as great. This conﬁrms that the group velocity of the wave packet matches the classical particle velocity: vclassical=vgroup=2vphase.

(e)Does the uncertainty principle hold? At what time tdoes the system come closest to the uncertainty limit? 2.5 THE DELTA-FUNCTION POTENTIAL 2.5.1 Bound States and Scattering States We have encountered two very different kinds of solutions to the time-independent Schrödinger equation: For the inﬁnite square well and the harmonic oscillator they are normalizable , and labeled by a discrete index n ; for the free particle they are non-normalizable , and labeled by a continuous variable k . The former represent physically realizable states in their own right, the latter do not; but in both cases the general solution to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation is a linear combination of stationary states—for the ﬁrst type this combination takes the form of a sum (over n), whereas for the second it is an integral (over k). What is the physical signiﬁcance of this distinction? Inclassical mechanics a one-dimensional time-independent potential can give rise to two rather different kinds of motion. If V(x)rises higher than the particle’s total energy (E)on either side (Figure 2.11(a)), then the particle is “stuck” in the potential well—it rocks back62 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation (b)Classical turning point (c)Classical turning points(a)Classical turning pointsV(x) V(x) V(x)E E V(x) EE xx xx Figure 2.11: (a) A bound state. (b) Scattering states. (c) A classical bound state, but a quantum scattering state. and forth between the turning points , but it cannot escape (unless, of course, you provide it with a source of extra energy, such as a motor, but we’re not talking about that). We call this abound state . If, on the other hand, Eexceeds V(x)on one side (or both), then the particle comes in from “inﬁnity,” slows down or speeds up under the inﬂuence of the potential, and returns to inﬁnity (Figure 2.11(b)). (It can’t get trapped in the potential unless there is some mechanism, such as friction, to dissipate energy, but again, we’re not talking about that.) We call this a scattering state . Some potentials admit only bound states (for instance, the harmonic oscillator); some allow only scattering states (a potential hill with no dips in it, for example); some permit both kinds, depending on the energy of the particle.2.5 The Delta-Function Potential 63 The two kinds of solutions to the Schrödinger equation correspond precisely to bound and scattering states. The distinction is even cleaner in the quantum domain, because the phenomenon of tunneling (which we’ll come to shortly) allows the particle to “leak” through any ﬁnite potential barrier, so the only thing that matters is the potential at inﬁnity (Figure 2.11(c)): /braceleftBigg E<V(−∞)andV(+∞)⇒ bound state, E>V(−∞)orV(+∞)⇒ scattering state.(2.112) In real life most potentials go to zero at inﬁnity, in which case the criterion simpliﬁes even further: /braceleftBigg E<0⇒ bound state, E>0⇒ scattering state.(2.113) Because the inﬁnite square well and harmonic oscillator potentials go to inﬁnity as x→±∞ , they admit bound states only; because the free particle potential is zero everywhere, it only allows scattering states.43In this section (and the following one) we shall explore potentials that support both kinds of states. 2.5.2 The Delta-Function Well TheDirac delta function is an inﬁnitely high, inﬁnitesimally narrow spike at the origin, whose area is 1 (Figure 2.12): δ(x)≡/braceleftbigg0,ifx/negationslash=0 ∞,ifx=0/bracerightbigg ,with/integraldisplay+∞ −∞δ(x)dx=1. (2.114) Technically, it isn’t a function at all, since it is not ﬁnite at x=0 (mathematicians call it a generalized function ,o rdistribution ).44Nevertheless, it is an extremely useful construct in theoretical physics. (For example, in electrodynamics the charge density of a point charge is a δ(x) x Figure 2.12: The Dirac delta function (Equation 2.114 ). 43If you are irritatingly observant, you may have noticed that the general theorem requiring E>Vmin(Problem 2.2) does not really apply to scattering states, since they are not normalizable. If this bothers you, try solving the Schrödinger equation with E≤0, for the free particle, and note that even linear combinations of these solutions cannot be normalized. The positive energy solutions by themselves constitute a complete set. 44The delta function can be thought of as the limit of a sequence of functions, such as rectangles (or triangles) of ever-increasing height and ever-decreasing width.64 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation delta function.) Notice that δ(x−a)would be a spike of area 1 at the point a. If you multiply δ(x−a)by an ordinary function f(x), it’s the same as multiplying by f(a), f(x)δ(x−a)=f(a)δ(x−a), (2.115) because the product is zero anyway except at the point a. In particular, /integraldisplay+∞ −∞f(x)δ(x−a)dx=f(a)/integraldisplay+∞ −∞δ(x−a)dx=f(a). (2.116) That’s the most important property of the delta function: Under the integral sign it serves to “pick out” the value of f(x)at the point a. (Of course, the integral need not go from −∞ to +∞; all that matters is that the domain of integration include the point a,s oa−/epsilon1toa+/epsilon1 would do, for any /epsilon1>0.) Let’s consider a potential of the form V(x)=−αδ(x), (2.117) whereαis some positive constant.45This is an artiﬁcial potential, to be sure (so was the inﬁnite square well), but it’s delightfully simple to work with, and illuminates the basic theory with a minimum of analytical clutter. The Schrödinger equation for the delta-function well reads −/planckover2pi12 2md2ψ dx2−αδ(x)ψ=Eψ; (2.118) it yields both bound states (E<0)and scattering states (E>0). We’ll look ﬁrst at the bound states. In the region x<0,V(x)=0, so d2ψ dx2=−2mE /planckover2pi12ψ=κ2ψ, (2.119) where κ≡√ −2mE /planckover2pi1. (2.120) (Eis negative, by assumption, so κis real and positive.) The general solution to Equation 2.119 is ψ(x)=Ae−κx+Beκx, (2.121) but the ﬁrst term blows up as x→−∞ , so we must choose A=0: ψ(x)=Beκx,(x<0). (2.122) In the region x>0,V(x)is again zero, and the general solution is of the form Fexp(−κx)+ Gexp(κx); this time it’s the second term that blows up (as x→+∞),s o ψ(x)=Fe−κx,(x>0). (2.123) It remains only to stitch these two functions together, using the appropriate boundary conditions at x=0. I quoted earlier the standard boundary conditions for ψ: /braceleftBigg 1.ψ is always continuous ; 2.dψ/dx is continuous except at points where the potential is inﬁnite.(2.124) 45The delta function itself carries units of 1/slashbig length (see Equation 2.114 ), soαhas the dimensions energy×length .2.5 The Delta-Function Potential 65 ψ(x) κ κ e−κx x Figure 2.13: Bound state wave function for the delta-function potential (Equation 2.125 ). In this case the ﬁrst boundary condition tells us that F=B,s o ψ(x)=/braceleftBigg Beκx,(x≤0), Be−κx,(x≥0);(2.125) ψ(x)is plotted in Figure 2.13. The second boundary condition tells us nothing; this is (like the walls of the inﬁnite square well) the exceptional case where Vis inﬁnite at the join, and it’s clear from the graph that this function has a kink at x=0. Moreover, up to this point the delta function has not come into the story at all. It turns out that the delta function determines thediscontinuity in the derivative ofψ,a tx=0. I’ll show you now how this works, and as a byproduct we’ll see why dψ/dxis ordinarily continuous. The idea is to integrate the Schrödinger equation, from −/epsilon1to+/epsilon1, and then take the limit as /epsilon1→0: −/planckover2pi12 2m/integraldisplay+/epsilon1 −/epsilon1d2ψ dx2dx+/integraldisplay+/epsilon1 −/epsilon1V(x)ψ(x)dx=E/integraldisplay+/epsilon1 −/epsilon1ψ(x)dx (2.126) The ﬁrst integral is nothing but dψ/dx, evaluated at the two end points; the last integral is zero, in the limit/epsilon1→0, since it’s the area of a sliver with vanishing width and ﬁnite height. Thus /Delta1/parenleftbiggdψ dx/parenrightbigg ≡lim /epsilon1→0/parenleftbigg∂ψ ∂x/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle +/epsilon1−∂ψ ∂x/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle −/epsilon1/parenrightbigg =2m /planckover2pi12lim /epsilon1→0/integraldisplay+/epsilon1 −/epsilon1V(x)ψ(x)dx. (2.127) Ordinarily, the limit on the right is again zero, and that’s why dψ/dxis ordinarily continuous. But when V(x)isinﬁnite at the boundary, this argument fails. In particular, if V(x)=−αδ(x), Equation 2.116 yields /Delta1/parenleftbiggdψ dx/parenrightbigg =−2mα /planckover2pi12ψ(0). (2.128) For the case at hand (Equation 2.125 ), /braceleftBigg dψ/dx=− Bκe−κx,for(x>0),sodψ/dx/vextendsingle/vextendsingle +=− Bκ, dψ/dx=+ Bκe+κx,for(x<0),sodψ/dx/vextendsingle/vextendsingle −=+ Bκ, and hence/Delta1(dψ/dx)=−2Bκ.A n dψ(0)=B. So Equation 2.128 says κ=mα /planckover2pi12, (2.129) and the allowed energy (Equation 2.120 )i s E=−/planckover2pi12κ2 2m=−mα2 2/planckover2pi12. (2.130)66 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation Finally, we normalize ψ: /integraldisplay+∞ −∞|ψ(x)|2dx=2|B|2/integraldisplay∞ 0e−2κxdx=|B|2 κ=1, so (choosing the positive real root): B=√κ=√mα /planckover2pi1. (2.131) Evidently the delta function well, regardless of its “strength” α, has exactly one bound state: ψ(x)=√mα /planckover2pi1e−mα|x|//planckover2pi12;E=−mα2 2/planckover2pi12. (2.132) What about scattering states, with E>0? For x<0 the Schrödinger equation reads d2ψ dx2=−2mE /planckover2pi12ψ=−k2ψ, where k≡√ 2mE /planckover2pi1(2.133) is real and positive. The general solution is ψ(x)=Aeikx+Be−ikx, (2.134) and this time we cannot rule out either term, since neither of them blows up. Similarly, for x>0, ψ(x)=Feikx+Ge−ikx. (2.135) The continuity of ψ(x)atx=0 requires that F+G=A+B. (2.136) The derivatives are/braceleftBigg dψ/dx=ik/parenleftbig Feikx−Ge−ikx/parenrightbig ,for(x>0),sodψ/dx/vextendsingle/vextendsingle +=ik(F−G), dψ/dx=ik/parenleftbig Aeikx−Be−ikx/parenrightbig ,for(x<0),sodψ/dx/vextendsingle/vextendsingle −=ik(A−B), and hence/Delta1(dψ/dx)=ik(F−G−A+B). Meanwhile,ψ(0)=(A+B), so the second boundary condition (Equation 2.128 ) says ik(F−G−A+B)=−2mα /planckover2pi12(A+B), (2.137) or, more compactly, F−G=A(1+2iβ)−B(1−2iβ),whereβ≡mα /planckover2pi12k. (2.138) Having imposed both boundary conditions, we are left with two equations (Equations 2.136 and2.138 ) in four unknowns (A,B,F, and G)—ﬁve, if you count k. Normalization won’t help—this isn’t a normalizable state. Perhaps we’d better pause, then, and examine the physical signiﬁcance of these various constants. Recall that exp (ikx)gives rise (when coupled with the wiggle factor exp (−iEt//planckover2pi1))to a wave function propagating to the right , and exp(−ikx)leads to a wave propagating to the left.I tf o l l o w st h a t A(in Equation 2.134 ) is the amplitude of a2.5 The Delta-Function Potential 67 AeikxFeikx Be–ikxGe–ikx x Figure 2.14: Scattering from a delta function well. wave coming in from the left, Bis the amplitude of a wave returning to the left; F(Equation 2.135 ) is the amplitude of a wave traveling off to the right, and Gis the amplitude of a wave coming in from the right (see Figure 2.14). In a typical scattering experiment particles are ﬁred in from one direction—let’s say, from the left. In that case the amplitude of the wave coming in from the right will be zero: G=0(for scattering from the left ); (2.139) Ais the amplitude of the incident wave ,Bis the amplitude of the reﬂected wave , and Fis the amplitude of the transmitted wave .

(2.140) (If you want to study scattering from the right ,s e t A=0; then Gis the incident amplitude, F is the reﬂected amplitude, and Bis the transmitted amplitude.) Now, the probability of ﬁnding the particle at a speciﬁed location is given by |/Psi1|2,s ot h e relative46probability that an incident particle will be reﬂected back is R≡|B|2 |A|2=β2 1+β2. (2.141) Ris called the reﬂection coefﬁcient . (If you have a beam of particles, it tells you the fraction of the incoming number that will bounce back.) Meanwhile, the probability that a particle will continue right on through is the transmission coefﬁcient47 T≡|F|2 |A|2=1 1+β2. (2.142) Of course, the sumof these probabilities should be 1—and it is: R+T=1. (2.143) 46This is not a normalizable wave function, so the absolute probability of ﬁnding the particle at a particular location is not well deﬁned; nevertheless, the ratio of probabilities for the incident and reﬂected waves ismeaningful. More on this in the next paragraph. 47Note that the particle’s velocity is the same on both sides of the well. Problem 2.34 treats the general case.68 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation Notice that RandTare functions of β, and hence (Equations 2.133 and2.138 )o fE: R=1 1+/parenleftbig 2/planckover2pi12E/mα2/parenrightbig,T=1 1+(mα2/2/planckover2pi12E). (2.144) The higher the energy, the greater the probability of transmission (which makes sense). This is all very tidy, but there is a sticky matter of principle that we cannot altogether ignore: These scattering wave functions are not normalizable, so they don’t actually represent possible particle states. We know the resolution to this problem: form normalizable linear combinations of the stationary states, just as we did for the free particle—true physical particles are rep- resented by the resulting wave packets. Though straightforward in principle, this is a messy business in practice, and at this point it is best to turn the problem over to a computer.48 Meanwhile, since it is impossible to create a normalizable free-particle wave function without involving a range of energies, RandTshould be interpreted as the approximate reﬂection and transmission probabilities for particles with energies in the vicinity ofE. Incidentally, it might strike you as peculiar that we were able to analyze a quintessentially time-dependent problem (particle comes in, scatters off a potential, and ﬂies off to inﬁnity) using stationary states. After all, ψ(in Equations 2.134 and2.135 ) is simply a complex, time-independent, sinusoidal function, extending (with constant amplitude) to inﬁnity in both directions. And yet, by imposing appropriate boundary conditions on this function we were able to determine the probability that a particle (represented by a localized wave packet) would bounce off, or pass through, the potential. The mathematical miracle behind this is, I suppose, the fact that by taking linear combinations of states spread over all space, and with essen- tially trivial time dependence, we can construct wave functions that are concentrated about a (moving) point, with quite elaborate behavior in time (see Problem 2.42). As long as we’ve got the relevant equations on the table, let’s look brieﬂy at the case of a delta-function barrier (Figure 2.15). Formally, all we have to do is change the sign of α. This kills the bound state, of course (Problem 2.2). On the other hand, the reﬂection and trans- mission coefﬁcients, which depend only on α2, are unchanged. Strange to say, the particle is just as likely to pass through the barrier as to cross over the well! Classically , of course, a particle cannot make it over an inﬁnitely high barrier, regardless of its energy. In fact, classi- cal scattering problems are pretty dull: If E>Vmax, then T=1 and R=0—the particle V(x) = αδ (x) x Figure 2.15: The delta-function barrier. 48There exist some powerful programs for analyzing the scattering of a wave packet from a one-dimensional poten- tial; see, for instance, “Quantum Tunneling and Wave Packets,” at PhET Interactive Simulations, University of Colorado Boulder, https://phet.colorado.edu.2.5 The Delta-Function Potential 69 certainly makes it over; if E<Vmaxthen T=0 and R=1—it rides up the hill until it runs out of steam, and then returns the same way it came. Quantum scattering problems are much richer: The particle has some nonzero probability of passing through the potential even ifE<Vmax. We call this phenomenon tunneling ; it is the mechanism that makes possible much of modern electronics—not to mention spectacular advances in microscopy. Conversely, even if E>Vmaxthere is a possibility that the particle will bounce back—though I wouldn’t advise driving off a cliff in the hope that quantum mechanics will save you (see Problem 2.35). ∗ Problem 2.22 Evaluate the following integrals: (a)/integraltext+1 −3/parenleftbig x3−3x2+2x−1/parenrightbig δ(x+2)dx.

Although the inte- gral is clearly inﬁnite when x=0, it doesn’t converge (to zero or anything else) when x/negationslash=0, since the integrand oscillates forever. There are ways to patch it up (for instance, you can integrate from −Lto+L, and interpret Equation 2.147 to mean the average value of the ﬁnite integral, as L→∞). The source of the problem is that the delta function doesn’t meet the requirement (square-integrability) for Plancherel’s theorem (see footnote 42). In spite of this, Equation 2.147 can be extremely useful, if handled with care. ∗∗ Problem 2.27 Consider the double delta-function potential V(x)=−α[δ(x+a)+δ(x−a)], whereαandaare positive constants.

Like the delta-function well, this potential admits both bound states (with E<0)and scattering states (with E>0). We’ll look ﬁrst at the bound states. In the region x<−athe potential is zero, so the Schrödinger equation reads −/planckover2pi12 2md2ψ dx2=Eψ, ord2ψ dx2=κ2ψ, where κ≡√ −2mE /planckover2pi1(2.149) is real and positive. The general solution is ψ(x)=Aexp(−κx)+Bexp(κx), but the ﬁrst term blows up (as x→−∞), so the physically admissible solution is ψ(x)=Beκx,(x<−a). (2.150) In the region−a<x<a,V(x)=−V0, and the Schrödinger equation reads2.6 The Finite Square Well 71 V(x) xa –a –V0 Figure 2.16: The ﬁnite square well (Equation 2.148 ). −/planckover2pi12 2md2ψ dx2−V0ψ=Eψ, ord2ψ dx2=−l2ψ, where l≡√2m(E+V0) /planckover2pi1. (2.151) Although Eis negative, for bound states, it must be greater than −V0, by the old theorem E>Vmin(Problem 2.2); so lis also real and positive. The general solution is49 ψ(x)=Csin(lx)+Dcos(lx),(−a<x<a), (2.152) where CandDare arbitrary constants. Finally, in the region x>athe potential is again zero; the general solution is ψ(x)=Fexp(−κx)+Gexp(κx), but the second term blows up (as x→∞), so we are left with ψ(x)=Fe−κx,(x>a). (2.153) The next step is to impose boundary conditions: ψanddψ/dxcontinuous at−aand+a. But we can save a little time by noting that this potential is an even function, so we can assume with no loss of generality that the solutions are either even or odd (Problem 2.1(c)). The advan- tage of this is that we need only impose the boundary conditions on one side (say, at +a);t h e other side is then automatic, since ψ(−x)=±ψ(x). I’ll work out the even solutions; you get to do the odd ones in Problem 2.29. The cosine is even (and the sine is odd), so I’m looking for solutions of the form ψ(x)=⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩Fe−κx,(x>a), Dcos(lx),(0<x<a), ψ(−x),(x<0).(2.154) The continuity of ψ(x),a tx=a, says Fe−κa=Dcos(la), (2.155) and the continuity of dψ/dxsays −κFe−κa=−lDsin(la). (2.156) Dividing Equation 2.156 by Equation 2.155 , we ﬁnd that 49You can, if you like, write the general solution in exponential form (C/primeeilx+D/primee−ilx). This leads to the same ﬁnal result, but since the potential is symmetric, we know the solutions will be either even or odd, and the sine/cosine notation allows us to exploit this right from the start.72 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation π/2 π 3π/2 2π 5π/2tan z (z0/z)2−1 zz0 Figure 2.17: Graphical solution to Equation 2.159 ,f o r z0=8(even states). κ=ltan(la). (2.157) This is a formula for the allowed energies, since κandlare both functions of E.T os o l v e forE, we ﬁrst adopt some nicer notation: Let z≡la,and z0≡a /planckover2pi1/radicalbig 2mV0. (2.158) According to Equations 2.149 and2.151 ,/parenleftbig κ2+l2/parenrightbig =2mV0//planckover2pi12,s oκa=/radicalBig z2 0−z2, and Equation 2.157 reads tanz=/radicalBig (z0/z)2−1. (2.159) This is a transcendental equation for z(and hence for E)as a function of z0(which is a mea- sure of the “size” of the well). It can be solved numerically, using a computer, or graphically, by plotting tan zand/radicalBig (z0/z)2−1 on the same grid, and looking for points of intersection (see Figure 2.17). Two limiting cases are of special interest: 1.Wide, deep well. Ifz0is very large (pushing the curve/radicalBig (z0/z)2−1 upward on the graph, and sliding the zero crossing, z0, to the right) the intersections occur just slightly below zn=nπ/2, with nodd; it follows (Equations 2.158 and2.151 ) that En+V0≈n2π2/planckover2pi12 2m(2a)2(n=1,3,5,...). (2.160) ButE+V0is the energy above the bottom of the well , and on the right side we have precisely the inﬁnite square well energies, for a well of width 2 a(see Equation 2.30)— or rather, half of them, since this nis odd. (The other ones, of course, come from the oddwave functions, as you’ll discover in Problem 2.29.) So the ﬁnite square well goes over to the inﬁnite square well, as V0→∞ ; however, for any ﬁnite V 0there are only a ﬁnite number of bound states. 2.Shallow, narrow well. Asz0decreases, there are fewer and fewer bound states, until ﬁnally, for z0<π/ 2, only one remains. It is interesting to note, however, that there is always onebound state, no matter how “weak” the well becomes. You’re welcome to normalize ψ(Equation 2.154 ), if you’re interested (Problem 2.30), but I’m going to move on now to the scattering states (E>0). To the left, where V(x)=0, we have2.6 The Finite Square Well 73 ψ(x)=Aeikx+Be−ikx,for(x<−a), (2.161) where (as usual) k≡√ 2mE /planckover2pi1. (2.162) Inside the well, where V(x)=−V0, ψ(x)=Csin(lx)+Dcos(lx),for(−a<x<a), (2.163) where, as before, l≡√2m(E+V0) /planckover2pi1. (2.164) To the right, assuming there is no incoming wave in this region, we have ψ(x)=Feikx. (2.165) Here Ais the incident amplitude, Bis the reﬂected amplitude, and Fis the transmitted amplitude.50 There are four boundary conditions: Continuity of ψ(x)at−asays Ae−ika+Beika=−Csin(la)+Dcos(la), (2.166) continuity of dψ/dxat−agives ik/bracketleftBig Ae−ika−Beika/bracketrightBig =l[Ccos(la)+Dsin(la)] (2.167) continuity ofψ(x)at+ayields Csin(la)+Dcos(la)=Feika, (2.168) and continuity of dψ/dxat+arequires l[Ccos(la)−Dsin(la)]=ikFeika. (2.169) We can use two of these to eliminate CandD, and solve the remaining two for BandF(see Problem 2.32): B=isin(2la) 2kl/parenleftBig l2−k2/parenrightBig F, (2.170) F=e−2ikaA cos(2la)−i(k2+l2) 2klsin(2la). (2.171) The transmission coefﬁcient/parenleftbig T=|F|2/|A|2/parenrightbig , expressed in terms of the original variables, is given by T−1=1+V2 0 4E(E+V0)sin2/parenleftbigg2a /planckover2pi1/radicalbig 2m(E+V0)/parenrightbigg . (2.172) Notice that T=1 (the well becomes “transparent”) whenever the sine is zero, which is to say, when 50Wecould look for even and odd functions, as we did in the case of bound states, but the scattering problem is inherently asymmetric, since the waves come in from one side only, and the exponential notation (representing traveling waves) is more natural in this context.74 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation T E1 Figure 2.18: Transmission coefﬁcient as a function of energy (Equation 2.172 ). 2a /planckover2pi1/radicalbig 2m(En+V0)=nπ, (2.173) where nis any integer.

Tis plotted in Figure 2.18, as a function of energy.51 ∗ Problem 2.29 Analyze the oddbound state wave functions for the ﬁnite square well. Derive the transcendental equation for the allowed energies, and solve it graphically. Examine the two limiting cases. Is there always an odd bound state? Problem 2.30 Normalizeψ(x)in Equation 2.154 , to determine the constants DandF. Problem 2.31 The Dirac delta function can be thought of as the limiting case of a rectangle of area 1, as the height goes to inﬁnity and the width goes to zero. Show that the delta- function well (Equation 2.117 ) is a “weak” potential (even though it is inﬁnitely deep), in the sense that z0→0. Determine the bound state energy for the delta-function potential, by treating it as the limit of a ﬁnite square well. Check that your answer is consistent with Equation 2.132 . Also show that Equation 2.172 reduces to Equation 2.144 in the appropriate limit. Problem 2.32 Derive Equations 2.170 and2.171 .Hint: Use Equations 2.168 and2.169 to solve for CandDin terms of F: C=/bracketleftbigg sin(la)+ik lcos(la)/bracketrightbigg eikaF;D=/bracketleftbigg cos(la)−ik lsin(la)/bracketrightbigg eikaF. Plug these back into Equations 2.166 and2.167 . Obtain the transmission coefﬁcient, and conﬁrm Equation 2.172 . 51This remarkable phenomenon was observed in the laboratory before the advent of quantum mechanics, in the form of the Ramsauer–Townsend effect .

(c)For a potential (such as this one) that does not go back to zero to the right of the barrier, the transmission coefﬁcient is notsimply|F|2/|A|2(with Athe incident amplitude and Fthe transmitted amplitude), because the transmitted wave travels at a different speed . Show that T=/radicalbigg E−V0 E|F|2 |A|2, (2.175) forE>V0.Hint: You can ﬁgure it out using Equation 2.99, or—more elegantly, but less informatively—from the probability current (Problem 2.18). What is T,f o r E<V0? (d)ForE>V0, calculate the transmission coefﬁcient for the step potential, and check thatT+R=1.

(b)I drew the ﬁgure so as to make you think of a car approaching a cliff, but obviously the probability of “bouncing back” from the edge of a cliff is farsmaller than what you got in (a)—unless you’re Bugs Bunny. Explain why this potential does not correctly represent a cliff. Hint: In Figure 2.20 the potential energy of the car drops discontinuously to−V0, as it passes x=0; would this be true for a falling car? (c)When a free neutron enters a nucleus, it experiences a sudden drop in potential energy, from V=0 outside to around −12 MeV (million electron volts) inside. Suppose a neutron, emitted with kinetic energy 4 MeV by a ﬁssion event, strikes such a nucleus. What is the probability it will be absorbed, thereby initiating another ﬁssion? Hint: You calculated the probability of reﬂection in part (a); use T=1−Rto get the probability of transmission through the surface. FURTHER PROBLEMS ON CHAPTER 2 Problem 2.36 Solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation with appropriate bound- ary conditions for the “centered” inﬁnite square well: V(x)=0( f o r−a<x<+a), V(x)=∞ (otherwise). Check that your allowed energies are consistent with mine (Equation 2.30), and conﬁrm that your ψs can be obtained from mine (Equation 2.31) by the substitution x→(x+a)/2 (and appropriate renormalization). Sketch your ﬁrst three solutions, and compare Figure 2.2. Note that the width of the well is now 2 a. Problem 2.37 A particle in the inﬁnite square well (Equation 2.22) has the initial wave function /Psi1(x,0)=Asin3(πx/a)(0≤x≤a). Determine A, ﬁnd/Psi1(x,t), and calculate /angbracketleftx/angbracketright, as a function of time. What is the expectation value of the energy? Hint: sinnθand cosnθcan be reduced, by repeated application of the trigonometric sum formulas, to linear combinations of sin (mθ)and cos(mθ), with m=0,1,2,..., n. Problem 2.38 (a)Show that the wave function of a particle in the inﬁnite square well returns to its original form after a quantum revival time T=4ma2/π/planckover2pi1. That is:/Psi1(x,T)= /Psi1(x,0)for any state ( notjust a stationary state). (b)What is the classical revival time, for a particle of energy Ebouncing back and forth between the walls? (c)For what energy are the two revival times equal?55 55The fact that the classical and quantum revival times bear no obvious relation to one another (and the quantum one doesn’t even depend on the energy) is a curious paradox; see D. F. Styer, Am. J. Phys. 69, 56 (2001).Further Problems on Chapter 2 77 Problem 2.39 In Problem 2.7(d) you got the expectation value of the energy by summing the series in Equation 2.21, but I warned you (in footnote 21) not to try it the “old fashioned way,” /angbracketleftH/angbracketright=/integraltext /Psi1(x,0)∗ˆH/Psi1(x,0)dx, because the discontinuous ﬁrst derivative of/Psi1(x,0)renders the second derivative problematic. Actually, you could have done it using integration by parts, but the Dirac delta function affords a much cleaner way to handle such anomalies. (a)Calculate the ﬁrst derivative of /Psi1(x,0)(in Problem 2.7), and express the answer in terms of the step function, θ(x−a/2), deﬁned in Equation 2.146 . (b)Exploit the result of Problem 2.23(b) to write the second derivative of /Psi1(x,0)in terms of the delta function.

(This represents, for example, a spring that can be stretched, but not compressed.) Hint: This requires some careful thought, but very little actual calculation. ∗∗∗ Problem 2.42 In Problem 2.21 you analyzed the stationary gaussian free particle wave packet. Now solve the same problem for the traveling gaussian wave packet, starting with the initial wave function /Psi1(x,0)=Ae−ax2eilx, where lis a (real) constant.

Notice that /Psi1(x,t)has the structure of a gaussian “envelope” modulating a traveling sinusoidal wave. What is the speed of the envelope? What is the speed of the traveling wave? ∗∗ Problem 2.43 Solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a centered inﬁnite square well with a delta-function barrier in the middle: V(x)=/braceleftBigg αδ(x),−a<x<+a, ∞,|x|≥a. Treat the even and odd wave functions separately. Don’t bother to normalize them. Find the allowed energies (graphically, if necessary). How do they compare with the corresponding energies in the absence of the delta function? Explain why the odd solutions are not affected by the delta function. Comment on the limiting cases α→0 andα→∞ . Problem 2.44 If two (or more) distinct56solutions to the (time-independent) Schrödinger equation have the same energy E, these states are said to be degenerate . For example, the free particle states are doubly degenerate—one solution representing motion to the right, and the other motion to the left. But we have never encountered normalizable degenerate solutions, and this is no accident. Prove the following theorem: In one dimension57(−∞<x<∞)there are no degenerate bound states. [Hint: Suppose there are twosolutions,ψ1andψ2, with the same energy E. Multiply the Schrödinger equation forψ1byψ2, and the Schrödinger equation for ψ2byψ1, and subtract, to show that(ψ2dψ1/dx−ψ1dψ2/dx)is a constant. Use the fact that for normalizable solutionsψ→0a t±∞ to demonstrate that this constant is in fact zero. Conclude thatψ2is a multiple of ψ1, and hence that the two solutions are not distinct.] Problem 2.45 In this problem you will show that the number of nodes of the station- ary states of a one-dimensional potential always increases with energy.58Consider two (real, normalized) solutions (ψnandψm)to the time-independent Schrödinger equation (for a given potential V(x)), with energies En>Em. (a)Show that d dx/parenleftbiggdψm dxψn−ψmdψn dx/parenrightbigg =2m /planckover2pi12(En−Em)ψmψn. 56If two solutions differ only by a multiplicative constant (so that, once normalized, they differ only by a phase factor eiφ), they represent the same physical state, and in this sense they are notdistinct solutions. Technically, by “distinct” I mean “linearly independent.” 57In higher dimensions such degeneracy is very common, as we shall see in Chapters 4and6. Assume that the potential does not consist of isolated pieces separated by regions where V=∞ —two isolated inﬁnite square wells, for instance, would give rise to degenerate bound states, for which the particle is either in one well or in the other. 58M.

(c)Ifψn(x)has no nodes between x1andx2, then it must have the same sign every- where in the interval. Show that (b) then leads to a contradiction. Therefore, between every pair of nodes of ψm(x),ψn(x)must have at least one node, and in particular the number of nodes increases with energy. Problem 2.46 Imagine a bead of mass mthat slides frictionlessly around a circular wire ring of circumference L. (This is just like a free particle, except that ψ(x+L)= ψ(x).) Find the stationary states (with appropriate normalization) and the corre- sponding allowed energies. Note that there are (with one exception) twoindependent solutions for each energy En—corresponding to clockwise and counter-clockwise cir- culation; call them ψ+ n(x)andψ− n(x).

Comment: This is a famous example of a reﬂectionless potential —every incident particle, regardless its energy, passes right through.62 Problem 2.53 The Scattering Matrix. The theory of scattering generalizes in a pretty obvious way to arbitrary localized potentials (Figure 2.21). To the left (Region I), V(x)=0, so ψ(x)=Aeikx+Be−ikx,where k≡√ 2mE /planckover2pi1.

(2.179) In between (Region II), of course, I can’t tell you what ψis until you specify the potential, but because the Schrödinger equation is a linear, second-order differential equation, the general solution has got to be of the form ψ(x)=Cf(x)+Dg(x), where f(x)andg(x)are two linearly independent particular solutions.63There will be four boundary conditions (two joining Regions I and II, and two joining Regions II and III). Two of these can be used to eliminate CandD, and the other two can be “solved” for BandFin terms of AandG: B=S11A+S12G,F=S21A+S22G. The four coefﬁcients Sij, which depend on k(and hence on E), constitute a 2 ×2 matrix S, called the scattering matrix (orS-matrix , for short). The S-matrix tells you the outgoing amplitudes ( BandF) in terms of the incoming amplitudes ( AandG): /parenleftbiggB F/parenrightbigg =/parenleftbiggS11S12 S21S22/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggA G/parenrightbigg .

(a)Find the four elements of the M-matrix, in terms of the elements of the S-matrix, and vice versa. Express Rl,Tl,Rr, and Tr(Equations 2.181 and2.182 ) in terms of elements of the M-matrix. (b)Suppose you have a potential consisting of two isolated pieces (Figure 2.22). Show that the M-matrix for the combination is the product of the two M-matrices for each section separately: M=M2M1. (2.184) (This obviously generalizes to any number of pieces, and accounts for the usefulness of the M-matrix.)

What is the transmission coefﬁcient for this potential? ∗∗ Problem 2.55 Find the ground state energy of the harmonic oscillator, to ﬁve signiﬁcant digits, by the “wag-the-dog” method. That is, solve Equation 2.73 numerically, vary- ingKuntil you get a wave function that goes to zero at large ξ. In Mathematica, appropriate input code would be Plot[ Evaluate [ u[x]/ .

We know that the correct solution is K=2n+1, so you might start with a “guess” of K=0.9. Notice what the “tail” of84 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation the wave function does. Now try K=1.1, and note that the tail ﬂips over. Somewhere in between those values lies the correct solution. Zero in on it by bracketing Ktighter and tighter.

Problem 2.56 Find the ﬁrst three excited state energies (to ﬁve signiﬁcant digits) for the harmonic oscillator, by wagging the dog (Problem 2.55). For the ﬁrst (and third) excited state you will need to set u[0]== 0,u/prime[0]== 1.) Problem 2.57 Find the ﬁrst four allowed energies (to ﬁve signiﬁcant digits) for the inﬁnite square well, by wagging the dog. Hint: Refer to Problem 2.55, making appropriate changes to the differential equation. This time the condition you are looking for is u(1)=0. Problem 2.58 In a monovalent metal, one electron per atom is free to roam throughout the object. What holds such a material together—why doesn’t it simply fall apart into a pile of individual atoms? Evidently the energy of the composite structure must be less than the energy of the isolated atoms. This problem offers a crude but illuminating explanation for the cohesiveness of metals. (a)Estimate the energy of Nisolated atoms, by treating each one as an electron in the ground state of an inﬁnite square well of width a(Figure 2.23(a)). (b)When these atoms come together to form a metal, we get Nelectrons in a much larger inﬁnite square well of width Na(Figure 2.23(b)). Because of the Pauli exclusion principle (which we will discuss in Chapter 5) there can only be one electron (two, if you include spin, but let’s ignore that) in each allowed state. What is the lowest energy for this system (Figure 2.23(b))? a(a) (b) N a Figure 2.23: (a)Nelectrons in individual wells of width a.( b ) Nelectrons in a single well of width Na.Further Problems on Chapter 2 85 (c)The difference of these two energies is the cohesive energy of the metal—the energy it would take to tear it apart into isolated atoms. Find the cohesive energy per atom, in the limit of large N. (d)A typical atomic separation in a metal is a few Ångström (say, a≈4 Å). What is the numerical value of the cohesive energy per atom, in this model? (Measured values are in the range of 2–4 eV .) ∗∗∗ Problem 2.59 The “bouncing ball.”65Suppose V(x)=/braceleftBigg mgx,x>0, ∞, x≤0.(2.185) (a)Solve the (time-independent) Schrödinger equation for this potential. Hint: First convert it to dimensionless form: −y/prime/prime(z)+zy(z)=/epsilon1y(z) (2.186) by letting z≡axandy(z)≡/parenleftbig 1/√a/parenrightbig ψ(x)(the√ais just so y(z)is normal- ized with respect to zwhenψ(x)is normalized with respect to x). What are the constants aand/epsilon1? Actually, we might as well set a→1—this amounts to a con- venient choice for the unit of length. Find the general solution to this equation (in Mathematica DSolve will do the job). The result is (of course) a linear combina- tion of two (probably unfamiliar) functions. Plot each of them, for (−15<z<5). One of them clearly does not go to zero at large z(more precisely, it’s not nor- malizable), so discard it. The allowed values of /epsilon1(and hence of E)are determined by the condition ψ(0)=0. Find the ground state /epsilon11numerically (in Mathematica FindRoot will do it), and also the 10th, /epsilon110. Obtain the corresponding normaliza- tion factors. Plot ψ1(x)andψ10(x),f o r0≤z<16. Just as a check, conﬁrm that ψ1(x)andψ10(x)are orthogonal. (b)Find (numerically) the uncertainties σxandσpfor these two states, and check that the uncertainty principle is obeyed. (c)The probability of ﬁnding the ball in the neighborhood dxof height xis (of course)ρQ(x)dx=|ψ(x)|2dx. The nearest classical analog would be the frac- tion of time an elastically bouncing ball (with the same energy, E)spends in the neighborhood dxof height x(see Problem 1.11). Show that this is ρC(x)dx=mg 2√E(E−mgx)dx, (2.187) or, in our units (with a=1), ρC(x)=1 2√/epsilon1(/epsilon1−x). (2.188) PlotρQ(x)andρC(x)for the stateψ10(x), on the range 0 ≤x≤12.5; superimpose the graphs ( Show , in Mathematica), and comment on the result. 65This problem was suggested by Nicholas Wheeler.86 CHAPTER 2 Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation ∗∗∗ Problem 2.60 The 1/x2potential. Suppose V(x)=/braceleftBigg −α/x2,x>0, ∞, x≤0.(2.189) whereαis some positive constant with the appropriate dimensions. We’d like to ﬁnd the bound states—solutions to the time-independent Schrödinger equation −/planckover2pi12 2md2ψ dx2−α x2ψ=Eψ (2.190) with negative energy (E<0). (a)Let’s ﬁrst go for the ground state energy, E0. Prove, on dimensional grounds, that there is no possible formula forE0—no way to construct (from the available con- stants m,/planckover2pi1, andα)a quantity with the units of energy. That’s weird, but it gets w o r s e.... (b)For convenience, rewrite Equation 2.190 as d2ψ dx2+β x2ψ=κ2ψ,whereβ≡2mα /planckover2pi12andκ≡√ −2mE /planckover2pi1. (2.191) Show that ifψ(x)satisﬁes this equation with energy E, then so too does ψ(λx), with energy E/prime=λ2E, for any positive number λ. [This is a catastrophe: if there exists any solution at all, then there’s a solution for every (negative) energy! Unlike the square well, the harmonic oscillator, and every other potential well we have encountered, there are no discrete allowed states—and no ground state. A system with no ground state—no lowest allowed energy—would be wildly unstable, cas- cading down to lower and lower levels, giving off an unlimited amount of energy as it falls. It might solve our energy problem, but we’d all be fried in the process.] Well, perhaps there simply are no solutions at all .... (c)(Use a computer for the remainder of this problem.) Show that ψκ(x)=A√xK ig(κx), (2.192) satisﬁes Equation 2.191 (here Kigis the modiﬁed Bessel function of order ig, and g≡√β−1/4). Plot this function, for g=4 (you might as well let κ=1f o r the graph; this just sets the scale of length). Notice that it goes to 0 as x→0 and as x→∞ . And it’s normalizable: determine A.66How about the old rule that the number of nodes counts the number of lower-energy states? This function has an inﬁnite number of nodes, regardless of the energy (i.e. of κ). I guess that’s consistent, since for any Ethere are always an inﬁnite number of states with even lower energy. (d)This potential confounds practically everything we have come to expect. The prob- lem is that it blows up too violently as x→0. If you move the “brick wall” over a hair, 66ψk(x)is normalizable as long as gis real—which is to say, provided β> 1/4. For more on this strange problem see A. M. Essin and D. J. Grifﬁths, A m .J .P h y s . 74, 109 (2006), and references therein.Further Problems on Chapter 2 87 V(x)=/braceleftBigg −α/x2,x>/epsilon1> 0, ∞, x≤/epsilon1,(2.193) it’s suddenly perfectly normal. Plot the ground state wave function, for g=4 and /epsilon1=1 (you’ll ﬁrst need to determine the appropriate value of κ),f r o m x=0t o x=6. Notice that we have introduced a new parameter (/epsilon1), with the dimensions of length, so the argument in (a) is out the window. Show that the ground state energy takes the form E0=−α /epsilon12f(β), (2.194) for some function fof the dimensionless quantity β. ∗∗∗ Problem 2.61 One way to obtain the allowed energies of a potential well numerically is to turn the Schrödinger equation into a matrix equation, by discretizing the variable x. Slice the relevant interval at evenly spaced points/braceleftbig xj/bracerightbig , with xj+1−xj≡/Delta1x, and let ψj≡ψ/parenleftbig xj/parenrightbig (likewise Vj≡V(xj)).

Evidently the allowed energies are the eigenvalues of the matrix H(orwould be, in the limit/Delta1x→0).67 Apply this method to the inﬁnite square well. Chop the interval (0≤x≤a)into N+1 equal segments (so that /Delta1x=a/(N+1)), letting x0≡0 and xN+1≡a.T h e boundary conditions ﬁx ψ0=ψN+1=0, leaving /Psi1≡⎛ ⎜⎝ψ1 ... ψN⎞ ⎟⎠.

Problem 2.63 The Boltzmann equation68 P(n)=1 Ze−βEn,Z≡/summationdisplay ne−βEn,β≡1 kBT, (2.202) gives the probability of ﬁnding a system in the state n(with energy En), at tempera- tureT(kBis Boltzmann’s constant).

Quantum mechanics will only enter this problem through quantization of the energies En.

Some of these are “accidental” features of speciﬁc potentials (the even spac- ing of energy levels for the harmonic oscillator, for example), but others seem to be more gen- eral, and it would be nice to prove them once and for all (the uncertainty principle, for instance, and the orthogonality of stationary states). The purpose of this chapter is to recast the theory in more powerful form, with that in mind. There is not much here that is genuinely new; the idea, rather, is to make coherent sense of what we have already discovered in particular cases. Quantum theory is based on two constructs: wave functions and operators. The state of a system is represented by its wave function, observables are represented by operators. Mathe- matically, wave functions satisfy the deﬁning conditions for abstract vectors , and operators act on them as linear transformations . So the natural language of quantum mechanics is linear algebra .1 But it is not, I suspect, a form of linear algebra with which you may be familiar. In an N- dimensional space it is simplest to represent a vector, |α/angbracketright,b yt h e N-tuple of its components, {an}, with respect to a speciﬁed orthonormal basis: |α/angbracketright→ a=⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝a1 a2 ... aN⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠; (3.1) theinner product ,/angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright, of two vectors (generalizing the dot product in three dimensions) is a complex number, /angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright=a∗ 1b1+a∗ 2b2+···+ a∗ NbN; (3.2) linear transformations, T, are represented by matrices (with respect to the speciﬁed basis), which act on vectors (to produce new vectors) by the ordinary rules of matrix multiplication: |β/angbracketright=ˆT|α/angbracketright→b=Ta=⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝t11 t12··· t1N t21 t22··· t2N ......... tN1tN2··· tNN⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝a1 a2 ... aN⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠. (3.3) But the “vectors” we encounter in quantum mechanics are (for the most part) functions , and they live in inﬁnite -dimensional spaces. For them the N-tuple/matrix notation is awk- ward, at best, and manipulations that are well behaved in the ﬁnite-dimensional case can be 1If you have never studied linear algebra, you should read the Appendix before continuing.92 CHAPTER 3 Formalism problematic. (The underlying reason is that whereas the ﬁnite sum in Equation 3.2always exists, an inﬁnite sum—or an integral—may not converge, in which case the inner product does not exist, and any argument involving inner products is immediately suspect.) So even though most of the terminology and notation should be familiar, it pays to approach this subject with caution. The collection of allfunctions of xconstitutes a vector space, but for our purposes it is much too large. To represent a possible physical state, the wave function /Psi1must be normalized : /integraldisplay |/Psi1|2dx=1. The set of all square-integrable functions, on a speciﬁed interval,2 f(x)such that/integraldisplayb a|f(x)|2dx<∞, (3.4) constitutes a (much smaller) vector space (see Problem 3.1(a)). Mathematicians call it L2(a,b); physicists call it Hilbert space .3In quantum mechanics, then: Wave functions live in Hilbert space . (3.5) We deﬁne the inner product of two functions ,f(x)andg(x), as follows: /angbracketleftf|g/angbracketright≡/integraldisplayb af(x)∗g(x)dx. (3.6) Iffandgare both square-integrable (that is, if they are both in Hilbert space), their inner product is guaranteed to exist (the integral in Equation 3.6converges to a ﬁnite number).4This follows from the integral Schwarz inequality :5 2For us, the limits ( aandb) will almost always be ±∞, but we might as well keep things more general for the moment. 3Technically, a Hilbert space is a complete inner product space , and the collection of square-integrable functions is only one example of a Hilbert space—indeed, every ﬁnite-dimensional vector space is trivially a Hilbert space. But since L2is the arena of quantum mechanics, it’s what physicists generally mean when they say “Hilbert space.” By the way, the word complete here means that any Cauchy sequence of functions in Hilbert space converges to a function that is also in the space: it has no “holes” in it, just as the set of all real numbers has no holes (by contrast, the space of all polynomials , for example, like the set of all rational numbers, certainly does have holes in it). The completeness of a space has nothing to do with the completeness (same word, unfortunately) of a set of functions , which is the property that any other function can be expressed as a linear combination of them. For an accessible introduction to Hilbert space see Daniel T. Gillespie, A Quantum Mechanics Primer (International Textbook Company, London, 1970), Sections 2.3and 2.4. 4In Chapter 2we were obliged on occasion to work with functions that were notnormalizable. Such functions lie outside Hilbert space, and we are going to have to handle them with special care. For the moment, I shall assume that all the functions we encounter arein Hilbert space. 5For a proof, see Frigyes Riesz and Bela Sz.-Nagy, Functional Analysis (Dover, Mineola, NY , 1990), Section 21. In a ﬁnite -dimensional vector space the Schwarz inequality, |/angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright|2≤/angbracketleftα|α/angbracketright/angbracketleftβ|β/angbracketright, is easy to prove (see Problem A.5). But that proof assumes the existence of the inner products, which is precisely what we are trying to establish here.3.1 Hilbert Space 93 /vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplayb af(x)∗g(x)dx/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤/radicalBigg/integraldisplayb a|f(x)|2dx/integraldisplayb a|g(x)|2dx. (3.7) You can check for yourself that deﬁnition (Equation 3.6) satisﬁes all the conditions for an inner product (Problem 3.1(b)). Notice in particular that /angbracketleftg|f/angbracketright=/angbracketleftf|g/angbracketright∗. (3.8) Moreover, the inner product of f(x)with itself , /angbracketleftf|f/angbracketright=/integraldisplayb a|f(x)|2dx, (3.9) isrealand non-negative; it’s zero only when f(x)=0.6 A function is said to be normalized if its inner product with itself is 1; two functions are orthogonal if their inner product is 0; and a setof functions,{fn},i sorthonormal if they are normalized and mutually orthogonal: /angbracketleftfm|fn/angbracketright=δmn. (3.10) Finally, a set of functions is complete if any other function (in Hilbert space) can be expressed as a linear combination of them: f(x)=∞/summationdisplay n=1cnfn(x). (3.11) If the functions {fn(x)}are orthonormal, the coefﬁcients are given by Fourier’s trick: cn=/angbracketleftfn|f/angbracketright, (3.12) as you can check for yourself. I anticipated this terminology, of course, back in Chapter 2.( T h e stationary states of the inﬁnite square well (Equation 2.31) constitute a complete orthonormal set on the interval (0,a); the stationary states for the harmonic oscillator (Equation 2.68 or 2.86) are a complete orthonormal set on the interval (−∞,∞).) Problem 3.1 (a)Show that the set of all square-integrable functions is a vector space (refer to Sec- tionA.1for the deﬁnition). Hint: The main point is to show that the sum of two square-integrable functions is itself square-integrable. Use Equation 3.7.I st h es e t of all normalized functions a vector space? (b)Show that the integral in Equation 3.6satisﬁes the conditions for an inner product (Section A.2). 6What about a function that is zero everywhere except at a few isolated points? The integral (Equation 3.9) would still vanish, even though the function itself does not. If this bothers you, you should have been a math major. In physics such pathological functions do not occur, but in any case, in Hilbert space two functions are considered equivalent if the integral of the absolute square of their difference vanishes. Technically, vectors in Hilbert space represent equivalence classes of functions.94 CHAPTER 3 Formalism ∗ Problem 3.2 (a)For what range of νis the function f(x)=xνin Hilbert space, on the interval (0,1)? Assumeνis real, but not necessarily positive. (b)For the speciﬁc case ν=1/2, is f(x)in this Hilbert space? What about xf(x)? How about(d/dx)f(x)? 3.2 OBSERVABLES 3.2.1 Hermitian Operators The expectation value of an observable Q(x,p)can be expressed very neatly in inner-product notation:7 /angbracketleftQ/angbracketright=/integraldisplay /Psi1∗ˆQ/Psi1dx=/angbracketleftbig /Psi1|ˆQ/Psi1/angbracketrightbig . (3.13) Now, the outcome of a measurement has got to be real, and so, a fortiori ,i st h e average of many measurements: /angbracketleftQ/angbracketright=/angbracketleftQ/angbracketright∗. (3.14) But the complex conjugate of an inner product reverses the order (Equation 3.8), so /angbracketleftbig /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQ/Psi1/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbigˆQ/Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/Psi1/angbracketrightbig , (3.15) and this must hold true for any wave function /Psi1. Thus operators representing observables have the very special property that /angbracketleftbig f/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQf/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbigˆQf/vextendsingle/vextendsinglef/angbracketrightbig for all f(x). (3.16) We call such operators hermitian .8 Actually, most books require an ostensibly stronger condition: /angbracketleftbig f/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQg/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbigˆQf/vextendsingle/vextendsingleg/angbracketrightbig for all f(x)and all g(x). (3.17) But it turns out, in spite of appearances, that this is perfectly equivalent to my deﬁnition (Equa- tion3.16), as you will prove in Problem 3.3. So use whichever you like. The essential point is that a hermitian operator can be applied either to the ﬁrst member of an inner product or to 7Remember that ˆQis the operator constructed from Qby the replacement p→− i/planckover2pi1d/dx. These operators are linear , in the sense that ˆQ/bracketleftbig af(x)+bg(x)/bracketrightbig =aˆQf(x)+bˆQg(x), for any functions fandgand any complex numbers aandb. They constitute linear transformations (Section A.3) on the space of all functions. However, they sometimes carry a function inside Hilbert space into a function outside it (see Problem 3.2(b)), and in that case the domain of the operator (the set of functions on which it acts) may have to be restricted (see Problem 3.48). 8In aﬁnite -dimensional vector space hermitian operators are represented by hermitian matrices ; a hermitian matrix is equal to its transpose conjugate: T=T†=˜T∗. If this is unfamiiar to you please see the Appendix.3.2 Observables 95 the second, with the same result, and hermitian operators naturally arise in quantum mechanics because their expectation values are real: Observables are represented by hermitian operators . (3.18) Well, let’s check this. Is the momentum operator, for example, hermitian? /angbracketleftbig f/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆpg/angbracketrightbig =/integraldisplay∞ −∞f∗(−i/planckover2pi1)dg dxdx=−i/planckover2pi1f∗g/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle∞ −∞+/integraldisplay∞ −∞/parenleftbigg −i/planckover2pi1df dx/parenrightbigg∗ gdx=/angbracketleftbig ˆpf/vextendsingle/vextendsingleg/angbracketrightbig .(3.19) I used integration by parts, of course, and threw away the boundary term for the usual reason: Iff(x)andg(x)are square integrable, they must go to zero at ±∞.9Notice how the complex conjugation of icompensates for the minus sign picked up from integration by parts—the operator d/dx(without the i)i snothermitian, and it does not represent a possible observable. Thehermitian conjugate (oradjoint ) of an operator ˆQis the operator ˆQ†such that /angbracketleftbig f/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQg/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbigˆQ†f/vextendsingle/vextendsingleg/angbracketrightbig/parenleftbig for all fandg/parenrightbig . (3.20) A hermitian operator, then, is equal to its hermitian conjugate: ˆQ=ˆQ†. ∗ Problem 3.3 Show that if/angbracketleftbig h/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQh/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbigˆQh/vextendsingle/vextendsingleh/angbracketrightbig for all h(in Hilbert space), then/angbracketleftbig f/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQg/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbigˆQf/vextendsingle/vextendsingleg/angbracketrightbig for all fandg(i.e. the two deﬁnitions of “hermitian” —Equations 3.16 and3.17— are equivalent). Hint: First let h=f+g, and then let h=f+ig. Problem 3.4 (a)Show that the sumof two hermitian operators is hermitian. (b)SupposeˆQis hermitian, and αis a complex number. Under what condition (on α) isαˆQhermitian? (c)When is the product of two hermitian operators hermitian? (d)Show that the position operator/parenleftbig ˆx/parenrightbig and the Hamiltonian operator/parenleftbigˆH= −/parenleftbig /planckover2pi12/2m/parenrightbig d2/dx2+V/parenleftbig x/parenrightbig/parenrightbig are hermitian. ∗ Problem 3.5 (a)Find the hermitian conjugates of x,i, and d/dx.

(c)Construct the hermitian conjugate of a+(Equation 2.48). 9As I mentioned in Chapter 1, there exist pathological functions that are square-integrable but do notgo to zero at inﬁnity. However, such functions do not arise in physics, and if you are worried about it we will simply restrict the domain of our operators to exclude them. On ﬁnite intervals, though, you really dohave to be more careful with the boundary terms, and an operator that is hermitian on (−∞,∞)may notbe hermitian on (0,∞)or(−π,π). (If you’re wondering about the inﬁnite square well, it’s safest to think of those wave functions as residing on the inﬁnite line—they just happen to be zero outside(0,a).) See Problem 3.48.96 CHAPTER 3 Formalism 3.2.2 Determinate States Ordinarily, when you measure an observable Qon an ensemble of identically prepared systems, all in the same state /Psi1, you do notget the same result each time—this is the inde- terminacy of quantum mechanics. Question: Would it be possible to prepare a state such that every measurement of Qis certain to return the same value (call it q)? This would be, if you like, a determinate state , for the observable Q. (Actually, we already know one example: Stationary states are determinate states of the Hamiltonian; a measurement of the energy, on a particle in the stationary state /Psi1n, is certain to yield the corresponding “allowed” energy En.) Well, the standard deviation of Q, in a determinate state, would be zero, which is to say, σ2=/angbracketleftBig/parenleftbig Q−/angbracketleftQ/angbracketright/parenrightbig2/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/parenleftbigˆQ−q/parenrightbig2/Psi1/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftbig/parenleftbigˆQ−q/parenrightbig /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/parenleftbigˆQ−q/parenrightbig /Psi1/angbracketrightbig =0. (3.21) (Of course, if every measurement gives q, their average is also q:/angbracketleftQ/angbracketright=q. I used the fact that ˆQ(and hence also ˆQ−q)i sa hermitian operator, to move one factor over to the ﬁrst term in the inner product.) But the only vector whose inner product with itself vanishes is 0, so ˆQ/Psi1=q/Psi1. (3.22) This is the eigenvalue equation for the operator ˆQ;/Psi1is an eigenfunction ofˆQ, and qis the corresponding eigenvalue : Determinate states of Qare eigenfunctions of ˆQ. (3.23) Measurement of Qon such a state is certain to yield the eigenvalue, q.10 Note that the eigen value is a number (not an operator or a function). You can multiply any eigenfunction by a constant, and it is still an eigenfunction, with the same eigenvalue. Zero does not count as an eigenfunction (we exclude it by deﬁnition—otherwise every num- ber would be an eigenvalue, since ˆQ0=q0=0 for any linear operator ˆQand all q). But there’s nothing wrong with zero as an eigen value . The collection of all the eigenvalues of an operator is called its spectrum . Sometimes two (or more) linearly independent eigenfunctions share the same eigenvalue; in that case the spectrum is said to be degenerate . (You encoun- tered this term already, for the case of energy eigenstates, if you worked Problems 2.44 or 2.46.) For example, determinate states of the total energy are eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian: ˆHψ=Eψ, (3.24) which is precisely the time-independent Schrödinger equation. In this context we use the letter Efor the eigenvalue, and the lower case ψfor the eigenfunction (tack on the wiggle factor exp/parenleftbig −iEt//planckover2pi1/parenrightbig to make it/Psi1, if you like; it’s still an eigenfunction of ˆH/parenrightbig . 10I’m talking about a competent measurement, of course—it’s always possible to make a mistake , and simply get the wrong answer, but that’s not the fault of quantum mechanics.3.3 Eigenfunctions of a Hermitian Operator 97 Example 3.1 Consider the operator ˆQ≡id dφ, (3.25) whereφis the usual polar coordinate in two dimensions. (This operator might arise in a physical context if we were studying the bead-on-a-ring; see Problem 2.46.) IsˆQ hermitian? Find its eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. Solution: Here we are working with functions f(φ)on the ﬁnite interval 0≤φ≤2π, with the property that f(φ+2π)=f(φ), (3.26) sinceφandφ+2πdescribe the same physical point. Using integration by parts, /angbracketleftbig f/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQg/angbracketrightbig =/integraldisplay2π 0f∗/parenleftbigg idg dφ/parenrightbigg dφ=if∗g/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2π 0−/integraldisplay2π 0i/parenleftbiggdf∗ dφ/parenrightbigg gdφ=/angbracketleftbigˆQf/vextendsingle/vextendsingleg/angbracketrightbig , soˆQi s hermitian (this time the boundary term disappears by virtue of Equation 3.26). The eigenvalue equation, id dφf(φ)=qf(φ), (3.27) has the general solution f(φ)=Ae−iqφ. (3.28) Equation 3.26 restricts the possible values of the q: e−iq2π=1⇒ q=0,±1,±2,.... (3.29) The spectrum of this operator is the set of all integers, and it is nondegenerate. Problem 3.6 Consider the operator ˆQ=d2/dφ2, where (as in Example 3.1)φis the azimuthal angle in polar coordinates, and the functions are subject to Equation 3.26.I s ˆQhermitian? Find its eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. What is the spectrum of ˆQ?I st h e spectrum degenerate? 3.3 EIGENFUNCTIONS OF A HERMITIAN OPERATOR Our attention is thus directed to the eigenfunctions of hermitian operators (physically: determi- nate states of observables). These fall into two categories: If the spectrum is discrete (i.e. the eigenvalues are separated from one another) then the eigenfunctions lie in Hilbert space and they constitute physically realizable states. If the spectrum is continuous (i.e. the eigenvalues ﬁll out an entire range) then the eigenfunctions are not normalizable, and they do not represent possible wave functions (though linear combinations of them—involving necessarily a spread in eigenvalues—may be normalizable). Some operators have a discrete spectrum only (for example, the Hamiltonian for the harmonic oscillator), some have only a continuous spectrum (for example, the free particle Hamiltonian), and some have both a discrete part and a contin- uous part (for example, the Hamiltonian for a ﬁnite square well). The discrete case is easier to98 CHAPTER 3 Formalism handle, because the relevant inner products are guaranteed to exist—in fact, it is very similar to the ﬁnite-dimensional theory (the eigenvectors of a hermitian matrix ). I’ll treat the discrete case ﬁrst, and then the continuous one. 3.3.1 Discrete Spectra Mathematically, the normalizable eigenfunctions of a hermitian operator have two important properties: Theorem 1 Their eigen values arereal. Proof: Suppose ˆQf=qf, (i.e. f(x)is an eigenfunction of ˆQ, with eigenvalue q), and11 /angbracketleftBig f/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQf/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig ˆQf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglef/angbracketrightBig /parenleftbigˆQis hermitian/parenrightbig . Then q/angbracketleftf|f/angbracketright=q∗/angbracketleftf|f/angbracketright (qis anumber , so it comes outside the integral, and because the ﬁrst function in the inner product is complex conjugated (Equation 3.6), so too is the qon the right). But /angbracketleftf|f/angbracketrightcannot be zero ( f(x)=0 is not a legal eigenfunction), so q=q∗, and hence q is real. QED This is comforting: If you measure an observable on a particle in a determinate state, you will at least get a real number. Theorem 2 Eigenfunctions belonging to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal . Proof: Suppose ˆQf=qf,andˆQg=q/primeg, andˆQis hermitian. Then/angbracketleftbig f/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQg/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbigˆQf/vextendsingle/vextendsingleg/angbracketrightbig ,s o q/prime/angbracketleftf|g/angbracketright=q∗/angbracketleftf|g/angbracketright (again, the inner products exist because the eigenfunctions are in Hilbert space). But q is real (from Theorem 1), so if q/prime/negationslash=qit must be that /angbracketleftf|g/angbracketright=0. QED That’s why the stationary states of the inﬁnite square well, for example, or the harmonic oscil- lator, are orthogonal—they are eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian with distinct eigenvalues. But this property is not peculiar to them, or even to the Hamiltonian—the same holds for determinate states of anyobservable. Unfortunately, Theorem 2tells us nothing about degenerate states/parenleftbig q/prime=q/parenrightbig . However, if two (or more) eigenfunctions share the same eigenvalue, any linear combination of them is itself an eigenfunction, with the same eigenvalue (Problem 3.7), and we can use the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization procedure (Problem A.4)t oconstruct orthogonal eigenfunctions within each degenerate subspace. It is almost never necessary to do this explicitly (thank God!), but it can always be done in principle. So even in the presence of degeneracy the eigenfunctions 11It is here that we assume the eigenfunctions are in Hilbert space—otherwise the inner product might not exist at all.3.3 Eigenfunctions of a Hermitian Operator 99 can be chosen to be orthonormal, and we shall always assume that this has been done. That licenses the use of Fourier’s trick, which depends on the orthonormality of the basis functions. In a ﬁnite -dimensional vector space the eigenvectors of a hermitian matrix have a third fundamental property: They span the space (every vector can be expressed as a linear combi- nation of them). Unfortunately, the proof does not generalize to inﬁnite-dimensional spaces. But the property itself is essential to the internal consistency of quantum mechanics, so (fol- lowing Dirac12) we will take it as an axiom (or, more precisely, as a restriction on the class of hermitian operators that can represent observables): Axiom: The eigenfunctions of an observable operator are complete : Any function (in Hilbert space) can be expressed as a linear combination of them.13 Problem 3.7 (a)Suppose that f(x)andg(x)are two eigenfunctions of an operator ˆQ, with the same eigenvalue q. Show that any linear combination of fandgis itself an eigenfunction ofˆQ, with eigenvalue q. (b)Check that f(x)=exp(x)andg(x)=exp(−x)are eigenfunctions of the operator d2/dx2, with the same eigenvalue. Construct two linear combinations of fandg that are orthogonal eigenfunctions on the interval (−1,1). Problem 3.8 (a)Check that the eigenvalues of the hermitian operator in Example 3.1are real. Show that the eigenfunctions (for distinct eigenvalues) are orthogonal. (b)Do the same for the operator in Problem 3.6. 3.3.2 Continuous Spectra If the spectrum of a hermitian operator is continuous , the eigenfunctions are not normalizable, and the proofs of Theorems 1and2fail, because the inner products may not exist. Nevertheless, there is a sense in which the three essential properties (reality, orthogonality, and completeness) still hold. I think it’s best to approach this case through speciﬁc examples. Example 3.2 Find the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the momentum operator (on the interval −∞< x<∞). Solution: Letfp(x)be the eigenfunction and pthe eigenvalue: −i/planckover2pi1d dxfp(x)=pfp(x). (3.30) The general solution is fp(x)=Aeipx//planckover2pi1. 12P. A. M. Dirac, The Principles of Quantum Mechanics , Oxford University Press, New York (1958). 13In some speciﬁc cases completeness is provable (we know that the stationary states of the inﬁnite square well, for example, are complete, because of Dirichlet’s theorem). It is a little awkward to call something an “axiom” that is provable in some cases, but I don’t know a better way to do it.100 CHAPTER 3 Formalism This is not square-integrable for any(complex) value of p—the momentum operator has noeigenfunctions in Hilbert space. And yet, if we restrict ourselves to real eigenvalues, we do recover a kind of ersatz “orthonormality.” Referring to Problems 2.23(a) and 2.26, /integraldisplay∞ −∞f∗ p/prime(x)fp(x)dx=|A|2/integraldisplay∞ −∞ei(p−p/prime)x//planckover2pi1dx=|A|22π/planckover2pi1δ/parenleftbig p−p/prime/parenrightbig . (3.31) If we pick A=1/√ 2π/planckover2pi1, so that fp(x)=1√ 2π/planckover2pi1eipx//planckover2pi1, (3.32) then/angbracketleftbig fp/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsinglefp/angbracketrightbig =δ/parenleftbig p−p/prime/parenrightbig , (3.33) which is reminiscent of trueorthonormality (Equation 3.10)—the indices are now continu- ous variables, and the Kronecker delta has become a Dirac delta, but otherwise it looks just the same. I’ll call Equation 3.33 Dirac orthonormality . Most important, the eigenfunctions (with real eigenvalues) are complete , with the sum (in Equation 3.11) replaced by an integral: Any (square-integrable) function f(x)can be written in the form f(x)=/integraldisplay∞ −∞c(p)fp(x)dp=1√ 2π/planckover2pi1/integraldisplay∞ −∞c(p)eipx//planckover2pi1dp. (3.34) The “coefﬁcients” (now a function ,c(p)) are obtained, as always, by Fourier’s trick: /angbracketleftbig fp/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsinglef/angbracketrightbig =/integraldisplay∞ −∞c(p)/angbracketleftbig fp/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsinglefp/angbracketrightbig dp=/integraldisplay∞ −∞c(p)δ/parenleftbig p−p/prime/parenrightbig dp=c/parenleftbig p/prime/parenrightbig . (3.35) Alternatively, you can get them from Plancherel’s theorem (Equation 2.103 ); indeed, the expansion (Equation 3.34) is nothing but a Fourier transform. The eigenfunctions of momentum (Equation 3.32) are sinusoidal, with wavelength λ=2π/planckover2pi1 p. (3.36) This is the old de Broglie formula (Equation 1.39), which I promised to justify at the appropri- ate time. It turns out to be a little more subtle than de Broglie imagined, because we now know that there is actually no such thing as a particle with determinate momentum. But we could make a normalizable wave packet with a narrow range of momenta, and it is to such an object that the de Broglie relation applies. What are we to make of Example 3.2? Although none of the eigenfunctions of ˆplives in Hilbert space, a certain family of them (those with real eigenvalues) resides in the nearby “suburbs,” with a kind of quasi-normalizability. They do not represent possible physical states, but they are still very useful (as we have already seen, in our study of one-dimensional scattering).14 14What about the eigenfunctions with nonreal eigenvalues? These are not merely non-normalizable—they actually blow up at±∞. Functions in what I called the “suburbs” of Hilbert space (the entire metropolitan area is sometimes called a “rigged Hilbert space”; see, for example, Leslie Ballentine’s Quantum Mechanics: A Modern Development,3.3 Eigenfunctions of a Hermitian Operator 101 Example 3.3 Find the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the position operator. Solution: Letgy(x)be the eigenfunction and ythe eigenvalue: ˆxgy(x)=xgy(x)=ygy(x). (3.37) Here yis a ﬁxed number (for any given eigenfunction), but xis a continuous variable. What function of xhas the property that multiplying it by xis the same as multiplying it by the constant y? Obviously it’s got to be zero, except at the one point x=y; in fact, it is nothing but the Dirac delta function: gy(x)=Aδ(x−y). This time the eigenvalue hasto be real; the eigenfunctions are not square integrable, but again they admit Dirac orthonormality: /integraldisplay∞ −∞g∗ y/prime(x)gy(x)dx=|A|2/integraldisplay∞ −∞δ/parenleftbig x−y/prime/parenrightbig δ(x−y)dx=|A|2δ/parenleftbig y−y/prime/parenrightbig . (3.38) If we pick A=1, so gy(x)=δ(x−y), (3.39) then/angbracketleftbig gy/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsinglegy/angbracketrightbig =δ/parenleftbig y−y/prime/parenrightbig . (3.40) These eigenfunctions are also complete : f(x)=/integraldisplay∞ −∞c(y)gy(x)dy=/integraldisplay∞ −∞c(y)δ(x−y)dy, (3.41) with c(y)=f(y) (3.42) (trivial, in this case, but you can get it from Fourier’s trick if you insist). If the spectrum of a hermitian operator is continuous (so the eigenvalues are labeled by a continuous variable— pory, in the examples; z, generically, in what follows), the eigenfunctions are not normalizable, they are not in Hilbert space and they do not repre- sent possible physical states; nevertheless, the eigenfunctions with real eigenvalues are Dirac orthonormalizable and complete (with the sum now an integral). Luckily, this is all we really require. World Scientiﬁc, 1998) have the property that although they have no (ﬁnite) inner product with themselves ,t h e y doadmit inner products with all members of Hilbert space. This is nottrue for eigenfunctions of ˆpwith nonreal eigenvalues. In particular, I showed that the momentum operator is hermitian for functions in Hilbert space ,b u t the argument depended on dropping the boundary term (in Equation 3.19). That term is still zero if gis an eigen- function ofˆpwith a real eigenvalue (as long as fis in Hilbert space), but not if the eigenvalue has an imaginary part. In this sense anycomplex number is an eigenvalue of the operator ˆp, but only realnumbers are eigenvalues of the hermitian operatorˆp—the others lie outside the space over which ˆpis hermitian.102 CHAPTER 3 Formalism Problem 3.9 (a)Cite a Hamiltonian from Chapter 2(other than the harmonic oscillator) that has only a discrete spectrum. (b)Cite a Hamiltonian from Chapter 2(other than the free particle) that has only a continuous spectrum. (c)Cite a Hamiltonian from Chapter 2(other than the ﬁnite square well) that has both a discrete and a continuous part to its spectrum. Problem 3.10 Is the ground state of the inﬁnite square well an eigenfunction of momentum? If so, what is its momentum? If not, whynot? [For further discussion, see Problem 3.34.] 3.4 GENERALIZED STATISTICAL INTERPRETATION In Chapter 1I showed you how to calculate the probability that a particle would be found in a particular location, and how to determine the expectation value of any observable quantity. In Chapter 2you learned how to ﬁnd the possible outcomes of an energy measurement, and their probabilities. I am now in a position to state the generalized statistical interpretation , which subsumes all of this, and enables you to ﬁgure out the possible results of anymeasurement, and their probabilities. Together with the Schrödinger equation (which tells you how the wave function evolves in time) it is the foundation of quantum mechanics. Generalized statistical interpretation: If you measure an observable Q(x,p) on a particle in the state /Psi1(x,t), you are certain to get one of the eigenvalues of the hermitian operator ˆQ(x,−i/planckover2pi1d/dx).15If the spectrum of ˆQis discrete, the probability of getting the particular eigenvalue qnassociated with the (orthonormalized) eigenfunction fn(x)is |cn|2,where cn=/angbracketleftfn|/Psi1/angbracketright. (3.43) If the spectrum is continuous, with real eigenvalues q(z)and associated (Dirac-orthonormalized) eigenfunctions fz(x), the probability of getting a result in the range dzis |c(z)|2dz where c(z)=/angbracketleftfz|/Psi1/angbracketright. (3.44) Upon measurement, the wave function “collapses” to the corresponding eigenstate.16 15You may have noticed that there is an ambiguity in this prescription, if Q(x,p)involves the product xp. Because ˆxandˆpdo not commute (Equation 2.52)—whereas the classical variables xandp, of course, do—it is not clear whether we should write ˆxˆporˆpˆx(or perhaps some linear combination of the two). Luckily, such observables are very rare, but when they do occur some other consideration must be invoked to resolve the ambiguity. 16In the case of continuous spectra the collapse is to a narrow range about the measured value, depending on the precision of the measuring device.3.4 Generalized Statistical Interpretation 103 The statistical interpretation is radically different from anything we encounter in classical physics. A somewhat different perspective helps to make it plausible: The eigenfunctions of an observable operator are complete , so the wave function can be written as a linear combination of them: /Psi1(x,t)=/summationdisplay ncn(t)fn(x). (3.45) (For simplicity, I’ll assume that the spectrum is discrete; it’s easy to generalize this discussion to the continuous case.) Because the eigenfunctions are orthonormal , the coefﬁcients are given by Fourier’s trick:17 cn(t)=/angbracketleftfn|/Psi1/angbracketright=/integraldisplay fn(x)∗/Psi1(x,t)dx. (3.46) Qualitatively, cntells you “how much fnis contained in /Psi1,” and given that a measurement has to return one of the eigenvalues of ˆQ, it seems reasonable that the probability of getting the particular eigenvalue qnwould be determined by the “amount of fn”i n/Psi1. But because probabilities are determined by the absolute square of the wave function, the precise measure is actually|cn|2. That’s the essential message of the generalized statistical interpretation.18 Of course, the total probability (summed over all possible outcomes) has got to be one: /summationdisplay n|cn|2=1, (3.47) and sure enough, this follows from the normalization of the wave function: 1=/angbracketleft/Psi1|/Psi1/angbracketright=/angbracketleftBigg/parenleftBigg/summationdisplay n/primecn/primefn/prime/parenrightBigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/parenleftBigg/summationdisplay ncnfn/parenrightBigg/angbracketrightBigg =/summationdisplay n/prime/summationdisplay nc∗ n/primecn/angbracketleftbig fn/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsinglefn/angbracketrightbig =/summationdisplay n/prime/summationdisplay nc∗ n/primecnδn/primen=/summationdisplay nc∗ ncn=/summationdisplay n|cn|2. (3.48) Similarly, the expectation value of Qshould be the sum over all possible outcomes of the eigenvalue times the probability of getting that eigenvalue: /angbracketleftQ/angbracketright=/summationdisplay nqn|cn|2. (3.49) Indeed, /angbracketleftQ/angbracketright=/angbracketleftbig /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQ/Psi1/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftBigg/parenleftBigg/summationdisplay n/primecn/primefn/prime/parenrightBigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/parenleftBigg ˆQ/summationdisplay ncnfn/parenrightBigg/angbracketrightBigg , (3.50) 17Notice that the time dependence—which is not at issue here—is carried by the coefﬁcients; to make this explicit I write cn(t). In the special case of the Hamiltonian (ˆQ=ˆH), when the potential energy is time independent, the coefﬁcients are in fact constant, as we saw in Section 2.1. 18Again, I am scrupulously avoiding the all-too-common claim “ |cn|2is the probability that the particle is in the state fn.” This is nonsense: The particle is in the state /Psi1,period . Rather,|cn|2is the probability that a measurement of Qwould yield the value qn. It is true that such a measurement will collapse the state to the eigenfunction fn,s o one might correctly say “ |cn|2is the probability that a particle which is now in the state/Psi1will be in the state fn subsequent to a measurement of Q”...b u tt h a t ’ saq u i t ed i f f e r e n ta s s e r t i o n .104 CHAPTER 3 Formalism butˆQfn=qnfn,s o /angbracketleftQ/angbracketright=/summationdisplay n/prime/summationdisplay nc∗ n/primecnqn/angbracketleftfn/prime|fn/angbracketright=/summationdisplay n/prime/summationdisplay nc∗ n/primecnqnδn/primen=/summationdisplay nqn|cn|2. (3.51) So far, at least, everything looks consistent. Can we reproduce, in this language, the original statistical interpretation for position mea- surements? Sure—it’s overkill, but worth checking. A measurement of xon a particle in state /Psi1 must return one of the eigenvalues of the position operator. Well, in Example 3.3we found that every (real) number yis an eigenvalue of x, and the corresponding (Dirac-orthonormalized) eigenfunction is gy(x)=δ(x−y). Evidently c(y)=/angbracketleftbig gy/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/Psi1/angbracketrightbig =/integraldisplay∞ −∞δ(x−y)/Psi1(x,t)dx=/Psi1(y,t), (3.52) so the probability of getting a result in the range dyis|/Psi1(y,t)|2dy, which is precisely the original statistical interpretation. What about momentum? In Example 3.2we found the (Dirac-orthonormalized) eigenfunc- tions of the momentum operator, fp(x)=(1/√ 2π/planckover2pi1)exp(ipx//planckover2pi1),s o c(p)=/angbracketleftbig fp/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/Psi1/angbracketrightbig =1√ 2π/planckover2pi1/integraldisplay∞ −∞e−ipx//planckover2pi1/Psi1(x,t)dx. (3.53) This is such an important quantity that we give it a special name and symbol: the momentum space wave function ,/Phi1(p,t). It is essentially the Fourier transform of the ( position space ) wave function/Psi1(x,t)—which, by Plancherel’s theorem, is its inverse Fourier transform: /Phi1(p,t)=1√ 2π/planckover2pi1/integraldisplay∞ −∞e−ipx//planckover2pi1/Psi1(x,t)dx; (3.54) /Psi1(x,t)=1√ 2π/planckover2pi1/integraldisplay∞ −∞eipx//planckover2pi1/Phi1(p,t)dp. (3.55) According to the generalized statistical interpretation, the probability that a measurement of momentum would yield a result in the range dpis |/Phi1(p,t)|2dp. (3.56) Example 3.4 A particle of mass mis bound in the delta function well V(x)=−αδ(x). What is the probability that a measurement of its momentum would yield a value greater than p0= mα//planckover2pi1?

What is the probability (to two signiﬁcant digits) that a measurement of pon a particle in this state would yield a value outside the classical range (for the same energy)? Hint: Look in a math table under “Normal Distribution” or “Error Function” for the numerical part—or use Mathematica.

But we have never actually proved it. In this section I will prove a more general version of the uncertainty principle, and explore some of its ramiﬁcations. The argument is beautiful, but rather abstract, so watch closely. 3.5.1 Proof of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle For any observable A, we have (Equation 3.21): σ2 A=/angbracketleftBig/parenleftBig ˆA−/angbracketleftA/angbracketright/parenrightBig /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/parenleftBig ˆA−/angbracketleftA/angbracketright/parenrightBig /Psi1/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftf|f/angbracketright106 CHAPTER 3 Formalism where f≡/parenleftBig ˆA−/angbracketleftA/angbracketright/parenrightBig /Psi1. Likewise, for any other observable, B, σ2 B=/angbracketleftg|g/angbracketright,where g≡/parenleftbigˆB−/angbracketleftB/angbracketright/parenrightbig /Psi1. Therefore (invoking the Schwarz inequality, Equation 3.7), σ2 Aσ2 B=/angbracketleftf|f/angbracketright/angbracketleftg|g/angbracketright≥|/angbracketleftf|g/angbracketright|2. (3.59) Now, for any complex number z, |z|2=[Re(z)]2+[Im(z)]2≥[Im(z)]2=/bracketleftbigg1 2i/parenleftbig z−z∗/parenrightbig/bracketrightbigg2 . (3.60) Therefore, letting z=/angbracketleftf|g/angbracketright, σ2 Aσ2 B≥/parenleftbigg1 2i/bracketleftbig /angbracketleftf|g/angbracketright−/angbracketleft g|f/angbracketright/bracketrightbig/parenrightbigg2 . (3.61) But (exploiting the hermiticity of/parenleftBig ˆA−/angbracketleftA/angbracketright/parenrightBig in the ﬁrst line) /angbracketleftf|g/angbracketright=/angbracketleftBig/parenleftBig ˆA−/angbracketleftA/angbracketright/parenrightBig /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/parenleftBig ˆB−/angbracketleftB/angbracketright/parenrightBig /Psi1/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/parenleftBig ˆA−/angbracketleftA/angbracketright/parenrightBig/parenleftBig ˆB−/angbracketleftB/angbracketright/parenrightBig /Psi1/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/parenleftBig ˆAˆB−ˆA/angbracketleftB/angbracketright−ˆB/angbracketleftA/angbracketright+/angbracketleftA/angbracketright/angbracketleftB/angbracketright/parenrightBig /Psi1/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆAˆB/Psi1/angbracketrightBig −/angbracketleftB/angbracketright/angbracketleftBig /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆA/Psi1/angbracketrightBig −/angbracketleftA/angbracketright/angbracketleftBig /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆB/Psi1/angbracketrightBig +/angbracketleftA/angbracketright/angbracketleftB/angbracketright/angbracketleft/Psi1|/Psi1/angbracketright =/angbracketleftbigˆAˆB/angbracketrightbig −/angbracketleftB/angbracketright/angbracketleftA/angbracketright−/angbracketleftA/angbracketright/angbracketleftB/angbracketright+/angbracketleftA/angbracketright/angbracketleftB/angbracketright =/angbracketleftbigˆAˆB/angbracketrightbig −/angbracketleftA/angbracketright/angbracketleftB/angbracketright. (Remember,/angbracketleftA/angbracketrightand/angbracketleftB/angbracketrightarenumbers , not operators, so you can write them in either order.) Similarly, /angbracketleftg|f/angbracketright=/angbracketleftbigˆBˆA/angbracketrightbig −/angbracketleftA/angbracketright/angbracketleftB/angbracketright, so /angbracketleftf|g/angbracketright−/angbracketleft g|f/angbracketright=/angbracketleftbigˆAˆB/angbracketrightbig −/angbracketleftbigˆBˆA/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbig/bracketleftbigˆA,ˆB/bracketrightbig/angbracketrightbig , where/bracketleftBig ˆA,ˆB/bracketrightBig ≡ˆAˆB−ˆBˆA is the commutator of the two operators (Equation 2.49).Conclusion: σ2 Aσ2 B≥/parenleftbigg1 2i/angbracketleftBig/bracketleftBig ˆA,ˆB/bracketrightBig/angbracketrightBig/parenrightbigg2 . (3.62) This is the (generalized) uncertainty principle . (You might think the imakes it trivial—isn’t the right side negative ? No, for the commutator of two hermitian operators carries its own factor of i, and the two cancel out;19the quantity in parentheses is real, and its square is positive .) 19More precisely, the commutator of two hermitian operators is itself anti-hermitian/parenleftBig ˆQ†=−ˆQ/parenrightBig , and its expectation value is imaginary (Problem 3.32).3.5 The Uncertainty Principle 107 As an example, suppose the ﬁrst observable is position/parenleftBig ˆA=x/parenrightBig , and the second is momen- tum/parenleftBig ˆB=−i/planckover2pi1d/dx/parenrightBig . We worked out their commutator back in Chapter 2(Equation 2.52): /bracketleftbig ˆx,ˆp/bracketrightbig =i/planckover2pi1. So σ2 xσ2 p≥/parenleftbigg1 2ii/planckover2pi1/parenrightbigg2 =/parenleftbigg/planckover2pi1 2/parenrightbigg2 , or, since standard deviations are by their nature positive, σxσp≥/planckover2pi1 (3.63) That’s the original Heisenberg uncertainty principle, but we now see that it is just one application of a much more general theorem. There is, in fact, an “uncertainty principle” for every pair of observables whose operators do not commute —we call them incompatible observables . Incompatible observables do not have shared eigenfunctions—at least, they cannot have a complete set of common eigenfunctions (see Problem 3.16). By contrast, compatible (commuting) observables doadmit complete sets of simultaneous eigenfunctions (that is: states that are determinate for both observables).20For example, in the hydrogen atom (as we shall see in Chapter 4) the Hamiltonian, the magnitude of the angular momentum, and the zcomponent of angular momentum are mutually compatible observables, and we will construct simultaneous eigenfunctions of all three, labeled by their respective eigenvalues. But there is noeigenfunction of position that is also an eigenfunction of momentum; these operators are incompatible. Note that the uncertainty principle is not an extra assumption in quantum theory, but rather aconsequence of the statistical interpretation. You might wonder how it is enforced in the laboratory— whycan’t you determine (say) both the position and the momentum of a particle? You can certainly measure the position of the particle, but the act of measurement collapses the wave function to a narrow spike, which necessarily carries a broad range of wavelengths (hence momenta) in its Fourier decomposition. If you now measure the momentum, the state will collapse to a long sinusoidal wave, with (now) a well-deﬁned wavelength—but the parti- cle no longer has the position you got in the ﬁrst measurement.21The problem, then, is that the second measurement renders the outcome of the ﬁrst measurement obsolete. Only if the wave function were simultaneously an eigenstate of both observables would it be possible to 20This corresponds to the fact that noncommuting matrices cannot be simultaneously diagonalized (that is, they cannot both be brought to diagonal form by the same similarity transformation), whereas commuting hermitian matrices canbe simultaneously diagonalized. See Section A.5. 21Bohr and Heisenberg were at pains to track down the mechanism by which the measurement of x(for instance) destroys the previously existing value of p. The crux of the matter is that in order to determine the position of a particle you have to poke it with something—shine light on it, say. But these photons impart to the par- ticle a momentum you cannot control. You now know the position, but you no longer know the momentum. Bohr’s famous debates with Einstein include many delightful examples, showing in detail how experimen- tal constraints enforce the uncertainty principle. For an inspired account see Bohr’s article in Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist , edited by Paul A. Schilpp, Open Court Publishing Co., Peru, IL (1970). In recent years the Bohr/Heisenberg explanation has been called into question; for a nice discussion see G. Brumﬁel, Nature News https://doi.org/10.1038/nature.2012.11394.108 CHAPTER 3 Formalism make the second measurement without disturbing the state of the particle (the second col- lapse wouldn’t change anything, in that case). But this is only possible, in general, if the two observables are compatible. ∗ Problem 3.14 (a)Prove the following commutator identities: /bracketleftBig ˆA+ˆB,ˆC/bracketrightBig =/bracketleftBig ˆA,ˆC/bracketrightBig +/bracketleftBig ˆB,ˆC/bracketrightBig , (3.64) /bracketleftBig ˆAˆB,ˆC/bracketrightBig =ˆA/bracketleftBig ˆB,ˆC/bracketrightBig +/bracketleftBig ˆA,ˆC/bracketrightBig ˆB.

(3.67) Hint: Use Equation 2.54. ∗ Problem 3.15 Prove the famous “(your name) uncertainty principle,” relating the uncer- tainty in position (A=x)to the uncertainty in energy/parenleftbig B=p2/2m+V/parenrightbig : σxσH≥/planckover2pi1 2m|/angbracketleftp/angbracketright|. For stationary states this doesn’t tell you much—why not? Problem 3.16 Show that two noncommuting operators cannot have a complete set of common eigenfunctions. Hint: Show that ifˆPandˆQhave a complete set of common eigenfunctions, then/bracketleftBig ˆP,ˆQ/bracketrightBig f=0 for any function in Hilbert space. 3.5.2 The Minimum-Uncertainty Wave Packet We have twice encountered wave functions that hitthe position-momentum uncertainty limit/parenleftbig σxσp=/planckover2pi1/2/parenrightbig : the ground state of the harmonic oscillator (Problem 2.11) and the Gaussian wave packet for the free particle (Problem 2.21). This raises an interesting question: What is the most general minimum-uncertainty wave packet? Looking back at the proof of the uncertainty principle, we note that there were two points at which inequalities came into the argument: Equation 3.59 and Equation 3.60. Suppose we require that each of these be an equality , and see what this tells us about /Psi1. The Schwarz inequality becomes an equality when one function is a multiple of the other: g(x)=cf(x), for some complex number c(see Problem A.5). Meanwhile, in Equation3.5 The Uncertainty Principle 109 3.60 I threw away the real part of z; equality results if Re (z)=0, which is to say, if Re/angbracketleftf|g/angbracketright=Re(c/angbracketleftf|f/angbracketright)=0. Now,/angbracketleftf|f/angbracketrightis certainly real, so this means the constant c must be pure imaginary—let’s call it ia. The necessary and sufﬁcient condition for minimum uncertainty, then, is g(x)=iaf(x),where ais real. (3.68) For the position-momentum uncertainty principle this criterion becomes: /parenleftbigg −i/planckover2pi1d dx−/angbracketleftp/angbracketright/parenrightbigg /Psi1=ia(x−/angbracketleftx/angbracketright)/Psi1, (3.69) which is a differential equation for /Psi1as a function of x. Its general solution (see Problem 3.17)i s /Psi1(x)=Ae−a(x−/angbracketleftx/angbracketright)2/2/planckover2pi1ei/angbracketleftp/angbracketrightx//planckover2pi1. (3.70) Evidently the minimum-uncertainty wave packet is a gaussian —and, sure enough, the two examples we encountered earlier were gaussians.22 Problem 3.17 Solve Equation 3.69 for/Psi1(x). Note that/angbracketleftx/angbracketrightand/angbracketleftp/angbracketrightareconstants (independent of x). 3.5.3 The Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle The position-momentum uncertainty principle is often written in the form /Delta1x/Delta1p≥/planckover2pi1 2; (3.71) /Delta1x(the “uncertainty” in x) is loose notation (and sloppy language) for the standard deviation of the results of repeated measurements on identically prepared systems.23Equation 3.71 is often paired with the energy-time uncertainty principle , /Delta1t/Delta1E≥/planckover2pi1 (3.72) Indeed, in the context of special relativity the energy-time form might be thought of as a con- sequence of the position-momentum version, because xandt(or rather, ct) go together in the position-time four-vector, while pandE(or rather, E/c) go together in the energy-momentum four-vector. So in a relativistic theory Equation 3.72 would be a necessary concomitant to Equation 3.71. But we’re not doing relativistic quantum mechanics. The Schrödinger equation is explicitly nonrelativistic: It treats tandxon a very unequal footing (as a differential equa- tion it is ﬁrst-order in t,b u t second -order in x), and Equation 3.72 is emphatically notimplied by Equation 3.71. My purpose now is to derive the energy-time uncertainty principle, and in 22Note that it is only the dependence of /Psi1onxthat is at issue here—the “constants” A,a,/angbracketleftx/angbracketright,a n d/angbracketleftp/angbracketrightmay all be functions of time, and for that matter /Psi1may evolve away from the minimal form. All I’m asserting is that if, at some instant, the wave function is gaussian in x, then (at that instant) the uncertainty product is minimal. 23Many casual applications of the uncertainty principle are actually based (often inadvertently) on a completely different—and sometimes quite unjustiﬁed—measure of “uncertainty.” See J. Hilgevoord, Am. J. Phys. 70, 983 (2002).110 CHAPTER 3 Formalism the course of that derivation to persuade you that it is really an altogether different beast, whose superﬁcial resemblance to the position-momentum uncertainty principle is actually quite misleading. After all, position, momentum, and energy are all dynamical variables—measurable char- acteristics of the system, at any given time. But time itself is not a dynamical variable (not, at any rate, in a nonrelativistic theory): You don’t go out and measure the “time” of a particle, as you might its position or its energy. Time is the independent variable, of which the dynamical quantities are functions . In particular, the /Delta1tin the energy-time uncertainty principle is not the standard deviation of a collection of time measurements; roughly speaking (I’ll make this more precise in a moment) it is the time it takes the system to change substantially . As a measure of how fast the system is changing, let us compute the time derivative of the expectation value of some observable, Q(x,p,t): d dt/angbracketleftbig Q/angbracketrightbig =d dt/angbracketleftBig /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQ/Psi1/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftbigg∂/Psi1 ∂t/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQ/Psi1/angbracketrightbigg +/angbracketleftBigg /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle∂ˆQ ∂t/Psi1/angbracketrightBigg +/angbracketleftbigg /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQ∂/Psi1 ∂t/angbracketrightbigg . Now, the Schrödinger equation says i/planckover2pi1∂/Psi1 ∂t=ˆH/Psi1 (where H=p2/2m+Vis the Hamiltonian). So d dt/angbracketleftQ/angbracketright=−1 i/planckover2pi1/angbracketleftBig ˆH/Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQ/Psi1/angbracketrightBig +1 i/planckover2pi1/angbracketleftBig /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQˆH/Psi1/angbracketrightBig +/angbracketleftBigg ∂ˆQ ∂t/angbracketrightBigg . ButˆHis hermitian, so /angbracketleftˆH/Psi1|ˆQ/Psi1/angbracketright=/angbracketleft/Psi1|ˆHˆQ/Psi1/angbracketright, and hence d dt/angbracketleftQ/angbracketright=i /planckover2pi1/angbracketleftBig/bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆQ/bracketrightBig/angbracketrightBig +/angbracketleftBigg ∂ˆQ ∂t/angbracketrightBigg . (3.73) This is an interesting and useful result in its own right (see Problems 3.18 and3.37). It has no name, though it surely deserves one; I’ll call it the generalized Ehrenfest theorem .I nt h e typical case where the operator does not depend explicitly on time,24it tells us that the rate of change of the expectation value is determined by the commutator of the operator with the Hamiltonian. In particular, if ˆQ commutes withˆH, then/angbracketleftQ/angbracketrightis constant, and in this sense Qis aconserved quantity. Now, suppose we pick A=Hand B=Q, in the generalized uncertainty principle (Equation 3.62), and assume that Qdoes not depend explicitly on t: σ2 Hσ2 Q≥/parenleftbigg1 2i/angbracketleftBig/bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆQ/bracketrightBig/angbracketrightBig/parenrightbigg2 =/parenleftbigg1 2i/planckover2pi1 id/angbracketleftQ/angbracketright dt/parenrightbigg2 =/parenleftbigg/planckover2pi1 2/parenrightbigg2/parenleftbiggd/angbracketleftQ/angbracketright dt/parenrightbigg2 . Or, more simply, σHσQ≥/planckover2pi1 2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingled/angbracketleftQ/angbracketright dt/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle. (3.74) 24Operators that depend explicitly on tare quite rare, so almost always∂ˆQ/∂t=0. As an example of explicit time dependence, consider the potential energy of a harmonic oscillator whose spring constant is changing (perhaps the temperature is rising, so the spring becomes more ﬂexible): Q=(1/2)m[ω(t)]2x2.3.5 The Uncertainty Principle 111 Let’s deﬁne/Delta1E≡σH, and /Delta1t≡σQ |d/angbracketleftQ/angbracketright/dt|. (3.75) Then /Delta1E/Delta1t≥/planckover2pi1 2, (3.76) and that’s the energy-time uncertainty principle. But notice what is meant by /Delta1t, here: Since σQ=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingled/angbracketleftQ/angbracketright dt/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/Delta1t, /Delta1trepresents the amount of time it takes the expectation value of Q to change by one standard deviation .25In particular,/Delta1tdepends entirely on what observable (Q)you care to look at—the change might be rapid for one observable and slow for another. But if /Delta1Eis small, then the rate of change of allobservables must be very gradual; or, to put it the other way around, if anyobservable changes rapidly, the “uncertainty” in the energy must be large. Example 3.5 In the extreme case of a stationary state, for which the energy is uniquely determined, all expectation values are constant in time (/Delta1E=0⇒/Delta1t=∞)—as in fact we noticed some time ago (see Equation 2.9). To make something happen you must take a linear combination of at least two stationary states—say: /Psi1(x,t)=aψ1(x)e−iE1t//planckover2pi1+bψ2(x)e−iE2t//planckover2pi1. Ifa,b,ψ1, andψ2are real, |/Psi1(x,t)|2=a2(ψ1(x))2+b2(ψ2(x))2+2abψ1(x)ψ2(x)cos/parenleftbiggE2−E1 /planckover2pi1t/parenrightbigg . The period of oscillation is τ=2π/planckover2pi1/(E2−E1). Roughly speaking, /Delta1E=E2−E1and /Delta1t=τ(for the exact calculation see Problem 3.20), so /Delta1E/Delta1t=2π/planckover2pi1, which is indeed ≥/planckover2pi1/2. Example 3.6 Let/Delta1tbe the time it takes a free-particle wave packet to pass a particular point (Figure 3.1). Qualitatively (an exact version is explored in Problem 3.21),/Delta1t=/Delta1x/v=m/Delta1x/p.B u t E=p2/2m,s o/Delta1E=p/Delta1p/m, and therefore, /Delta1E/Delta1t=p/Delta1p mm/Delta1x p=/Delta1x/Delta1p, which is≥/planckover2pi1/2 by the position-momentum uncertainty principle. 25This is sometimes called the “Mandelstam–Tamm” formulation of the energy-time uncertainty principle. For a review of alternative approaches see P. Busch, Found. Phys. 20, 1 (1990).112 CHAPTER 3 Formalism Δx υ A x Figure 3.1: A free particle wave packet approaches the point A(Example 3.6). Example 3.7 The/Delta1particle lasts about 10−23s, before spontaneously disintegrating. If you make a histogram of all measurements of its mass, you get a kind of bell-shaped curve centered at 1232 MeV/ c2, with a width of about 120 MeV/ c2(Figure 3.2). Why does the rest energy/parenleftbig mc2/parenrightbig sometimes come out higher than 1232, and sometimes lower? Is this experimental error? No, for if we take /Delta1tto be the lifetime of the particle (certainly onemeasure of “how long it takes the system to change appreciably”), /Delta1E/Delta1t=/parenleftbigg120 2MeV/parenrightbigg/parenleftBig 10−23s/parenrightBig =6×10−22MeV-s, whereas /planckover2pi1/2=3×10−22MeV s. So the spread in mis about as small as the uncertainty principle allows—a particle with so short a lifetime just doesn’t have a very well-deﬁned mass.26 1100 1200 1300 mass (MeV/ c2)1400 Figure 3.2: Measurements of the /Delta1mass (Example 3.7). Notice the variety of speciﬁc meanings attaching to the term /Delta1tin these examples: In Exam- ple3.5it’s a period of oscillation; in Example 3.6it’s the time it takes a particle to pass a point; in Example 3.7it’s the lifetime of an unstable particle. In every case, however, /Delta1tis the time it takes for the system to undergo “substantial” change. It is often said that the uncertainty principle means energy is not strictly conserved in quan- tum mechanics—that you’re allowed to “borrow” energy /Delta1E, as long as you “pay it back” 26In truth, Example 3.7is a bit of a fraud. You can’t measure 10−23s on a stop-watch, and in practice the lifetime of such a short-lived particle is inferred from the width of the mass plot, using the uncertainty principle as input . However, the point is valid, even if the logic is backwards. Moreover, if you assume the /Delta1is about the same size as a proton/parenleftBig ∼10−15m/parenrightBig ,t h e n1 0−23sec is roughly the time it takes light to cross the particle, and it’s hard to imagine that the lifetime could be much lessthan that.3.6 Vectors and Operators 113 in a time/Delta1t≈/planckover2pi1/(2/Delta1E); the greater the violation, the briefer the period over which it can occur. Now, there are many legitimate readings of the energy-time uncertainty principle, but this is not one of them. Nowhere does quantum mechanics license violation of energy conser- vation, and certainly no such authorization entered into the derivation of Equation 3.76.B u t the uncertainty principle is extraordinarily robust: It can be misused without leading to seri- ously incorrect results, and as a consequence physicists are in the habit of applying it rather carelessly. ∗ Problem 3.18 Apply Equation 3.73 to the following special cases: (a) Q=1; (b) Q=H; (c)Q=x;( d ) Q=p. In each case, comment on the result, with particular reference to Equations 1.27,1.33,1.38, and conservation of energy (see remarks following Equation 2.21). Problem 3.19 Use Equation 3.73 (or Problem 3.18 (c) and (d)) to show that: (a)For any (normalized) wave packet representing a free particle (V(x)=0),/angbracketleftx/angbracketright moves at constant velocity (this is the quantum analog to Newton’s ﬁrst law). Note: You showed this for a gaussian wave packet in Problem 2.42, but it is completely general. (b)For any (normalized) wave packet representing a particle in the harmonic oscil- lator potential/parenleftBig V(x)=1 2mω2x2/parenrightBig ,/angbracketleftx/angbracketrightoscillates at the classical frequency. Note: You showed this for a particular gaussian wave packet in Problem 2.49, but it is completely general.

The vector itself lives “out there in space,” independent of anybody’s (arbitrary) choice of coordinates. The same is true for the state of a system in quantum mechanics. It is represented by a vector ,|S(t)/angbracketright, that lives “out there in Hilbert space,” but we can express it with respect to any number of different bases . The wave function /Psi1(x,t)is actually the x“component” in the expansion of|S(t)/angbracketrightin the basis of position eigenfunctions: /Psi1(x,t)=/angbracketleftx|S(t)/angbracketright, (3.77) (the analog to ˆı·A) with|x/angbracketrightstanding for the eigenfunction of ˆxwith eigenvalue x.27The momentum space wave function /Phi1(p,t)is the pcomponent in the expansion of |S(t)/angbracketrightin the basis of momentum eigenfunctions: /Phi1(p,t)=/angbracketleftp|S(t)/angbracketright (3.78) (with|p/angbracketrightstanding for the eigenfunction of ˆpwith eigenvalue p).28Or we could expand |S(t)/angbracketright in the basis of energy eigenfunctions (supposing for simplicity that the spectrum is discrete): cn(t)=/angbracketleftn|S(t)/angbracketright (3.79) (with|n/angbracketrightstanding for the nth eigenfunction of ˆH—Equation 3.46). But it’s all the same state; the functions /Psi1and/Phi1, and the collection of coefﬁcients {cn}, contain exactly the same information—they are simply three different ways of identifying the same vector: 27I hesitate to call it gx(Equation 3.39), because that is its form in the position basis, and the whole point here is to free ourselves from any particular basis. Indeed, when I ﬁrst deﬁned Hilbert space as the set of square-integrable functions—over x—that was already too restrictive, committing us to a speciﬁc representation (the position basis). I want now to think of it as an abstract vector space, whose members can be expressed with respect to any basis you like. 28In position space it would be fp(Equation 3.32).3.6 Vectors and Operators 115 |S(t)/angbracketright→/integraldisplay /Psi1(y,t)δ(x−y)dy=/integraldisplay /Phi1(p,t)1√ 2π/planckover2pi1eipx//planckover2pi1dp =/summationdisplay cne−iEnt//planckover2pi1ψn(x). (3.80) Operators (representing observables) are linear transformations on Hilbert space—they “transform” one vector into another: /vextendsingle/vextendsingleβ/angbracketrightbig =ˆQ/vextendsingle/vextendsingleα/angbracketrightbig . (3.81) Just as vectors are represented, with respect to an orthonormal basis {|en/angbracketright},29by their components, |α/angbracketright=/summationdisplay nan/vextendsingle/vextendsingleen/angbracketrightbig ,/vextendsingle/vextendsingleβ/angbracketrightbig =/summationdisplay nbn/vextendsingle/vextendsingleen/angbracketrightbig ,an=/angbracketleftbig en/vextendsingle/vextendsingleα/angbracketrightbig ,bn=/angbracketleften|β/angbracketright, (3.82) operators are represented (with respect to a particular basis) by their matrix elements30 /angbracketleftBig em/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleen/angbracketrightBig ≡Qmn. (3.83) In this notation Equation 3.81 says /summationdisplay nbn|en/angbracketright=/summationdisplay nanˆQ|en/angbracketright, (3.84) or, taking the inner product with |em/angbracketright, /summationdisplay nbn/angbracketleftem|en/angbracketright=/summationdisplay nan/angbracketleftBig em/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleen/angbracketrightBig , (3.85) and hence (since /angbracketleftem|en/angbracketright=δmn) bm=/summationdisplay nQmnan. (3.86) Thus the matrix elements of ˆQtell you how the components transform.31 Later on we will encounter systems that admit only a ﬁnite number Nof linearly indepen- dent states. In that case |S(t)/angbracketrightlives in an N-dimensional vector space; it can be represented as a column of(N)components (with respect to a given basis), and operators take the form of ordinary(N×N)matrices. These are the simplest quantum systems—none of the subtleties associated with inﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces arise. Easiest of all is the two-state system, which we explore in the following example. 29I’ll assume the basis is discrete; otherwise nbecomes a continuous index and the sums are replaced by integrals. 30This terminology is inspired, obviously, by the ﬁnite-dimensional case, but the “matrix” will now typically have an inﬁnite (maybe even uncountable) number of elements. 31In matrix notation Equation 3.86 becomes b=Qa(with the vectors expressed as columns), by the ordinary rules of matrix multiplication—see Equation A.42 .116 CHAPTER 3 Formalism Example 3.8 Imagine a system in which there are just twolinearly independent states:32 |1/angbracketright=/parenleftbigg1 0/parenrightbigg and|2/angbracketright=/parenleftbigg0 1/parenrightbigg . The most general state is a normalized linear combination: |S/angbracketright=a|1/angbracketright+b|2/angbracketright=/parenleftbigga b/parenrightbigg ,with|a|2+|b|2=1. The Hamiltonian can be expressed as a (hermitian) matrix (Equation 3.83); suppose it has the speciﬁc form H=/parenleftbigghg gh/parenrightbigg , where gandhare real constants. If the system starts out (at t=0) in state|1/angbracketright, what is its state at time t? Solution: The (time-dependent) Schrödinger equation33says i/planckover2pi1d dt|S(t)/angbracketright=ˆH|S(t)/angbracketright. (3.87) As always, we begin by solving the time- independent Schrödinger equation: ˆH|s/angbracketright=E|s/angbracketright; (3.88) that is, we look for the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of ˆH. The characteristic equation determines the eigenvalues: det/parenleftbiggh−Eg gh−E/parenrightbigg =(h−E)2−g2=0⇒h−E=∓g⇒E±=h±g. Evidently the allowed energies are (h+g)and(h−g). To determine the eigenvectors, we write/parenleftbigghg gh/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggα β/parenrightbigg =(h±g)/parenleftbiggα β/parenrightbigg ⇒hα+gβ=(h±g)α⇒β=±α, so the normalized eigenvectors are |s±/angbracketright=1√ 2/parenleftbigg1 ±1/parenrightbigg . Next we expand the initial state as a linear combination of eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian: |S(0)/angbracketright=/parenleftbigg1 0/parenrightbigg =1√ 2(|s+/angbracketright+|s−/angbracketright). 32Technically, the “equals” signs here mean “is represented by,” but I don’t think any confusion will arise if we adopt the customary informal notation. 33We began, back in Chapter 1, with the Schrödinger equation for the wave function in position space; here we generalize it to the state vector in Hilbert space.3.6 Vectors and Operators 117 Finally, we tack on the standard time-dependence (the wiggle factor) exp (−iEnt//planckover2pi1): |S(t)/angbracketright=1√ 2/bracketleftBig e−i(h+g)t//planckover2pi1|s+/angbracketright+e−i(h−g)t//planckover2pi1|s−/angbracketright/bracketrightBig =1 2e−iht//planckover2pi1/bracketleftbigg e−igt//planckover2pi1/parenleftbigg1 1/parenrightbigg +eigt//planckover2pi1/parenleftbigg1 −1/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg =1 2e−iht//planckover2pi1/parenleftbigge−igt//planckover2pi1+eigt//planckover2pi1 e−igt//planckover2pi1−eigt//planckover2pi1/parenrightbigg =e−iht//planckover2pi1/parenleftbiggcos(gt//planckover2pi1) −isin(gt//planckover2pi1)/parenrightbigg . If you doubt this result, by all means check it: Does it satisfy the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (Equation 3.87)? Does it match the initial state when t=0?34 Just as vectors look different when expressed in different bases, so too do operators (or, in the discrete case, the matrices that represent them). We have already encountered a particularly nice example: ˆx(the position operator) →/braceleftBigg x (in position space) , i/planckover2pi1∂/∂p(in momentum space) ; ˆp(the momentum operator) →/braceleftBigg −i/planckover2pi1∂/∂x(in position space) , p (in momentum space) . (“Position space” is nothing but the position basis; “momentum space” is the momentum basis.) If someone asked you, “What is the operator, ˆx, representing position, in quantum mechanics?” you would probably answer “Just xitself.” But an equally correct reply would be “i/planckover2pi1∂/∂p,” and the best response would be “With respect to what basis?” I have often said “the state of a system is represented by its wave function, /Psi1(x,t),” and this is true, in the same sense that an ordinary vector in three dimensions is “represented by” the triplet of its components; but really, I should always add “in the position basis.” After all, the state of the system is a vector in Hilbert space, |S(t)/angbracketright; it makes no reference to any particular basis. Its connection to /Psi1(x,t)is given by Equation 3.77:/Psi1(x,t)=/angbracketleftx|S(t)/angbracketright.H a v i n gs a i d that, for the most part we doin fact work in position space, and no serious harm comes from referring to the wave function as “the state of the system.” 3.6.2 Dirac Notation Dirac proposed to chop the bracket notation for the inner product, /angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright, into two pieces, which he called bra,/angbracketleftα|, and ket,|β/angbracketright(I don’t know what happened to the c). The latter is a vector, but what exactly is the former? It’s a linear function of vectors, in the sense that when it hits a vector (to its right) it yields a (complex) number—the inner product. (When an operator hits a vector, it delivers another vector; when a brahits a vector, it delivers a number.) In a function space, the bra can be thought of as an instruction to integrate: /angbracketleftf|=/integraldisplay f∗[···]dx, 34This is a crude model for (among other things) neutrino oscillations . In that context |1/angbracketrightrepresents (say) the electron neutrino, and |2/angbracketrightthe muon neutrino; if the Hamiltonian has a nonvanishing off-diagonal term (g)then in the course of time the electron neutrino will turn into a muon neutrino (and back again).118 CHAPTER 3 Formalism with the ellipsis [···]waiting to be ﬁlled by whatever function the bra encounters in the ket to its right. In a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space, with the kets expressed as columns (of components with respect to some basis), |α/angbracketright→⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝a1 a2 ... an⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠, (3.89) the bras are rows: /angbracketleftβ|→/parenleftbig b∗ 1b∗ 2...b∗ n/parenrightbig , (3.90) and/angbracketleftβ|α/angbracketright=b∗ 1a1+b∗ 2a2+···+ b∗ nanis the matrix product. The collection of all bras constitutes another vector space—the so-called dual space . The license to treat bras as separate entities in their own right allows for some powerful and pretty notation. For example, if |α/angbracketrightis a normalized vector, the operator ˆP≡|α/angbracketright/angbracketleftα| (3.91) picks out the portion of any other vector that “lies along” |α/angbracketright: ˆP|β/angbracketright=(/angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright)|α/angbracketright; we call it the projection operator onto the one-dimensional subspace spanned by |α/angbracketright.I f{|en/angbracketright} is a discrete orthonormal basis, /angbracketleftem|en/angbracketright=δmn, (3.92) then /summationdisplay n|en/angbracketright/angbracketleften|=1 (3.93) (the identity operator). For if we let this operator act on any vector |α/angbracketright, we recover the expansion of|α/angbracketrightin the{|en/angbracketright}basis: /summationdisplay n(/angbracketleften|α/angbracketright)|en/angbracketright=|α/angbracketright. (3.94) Similarly, if{|ez/angbracketright}is aDirac orthonormalized continuous basis, /angbracketleftbig ez|ez/prime/angbracketrightbig =δ/parenleftbig z−z/prime/parenrightbig , (3.95) then /integraldisplay |ez/angbracketright/angbracketleftez|dz=1. (3.96) Equations 3.93 and3.96 are the tidiest ways to express completeness . Technically, the guts of a ket or a bra (the ellipsis in |···/angbracketright or/angbracketleft···| )i sa name —the name of the vector in question: “ α,” or “ n,” or for that matter “Alice,” or “Bob.” It is endowed with no intrinsic mathematical attributes. Of course, it may be helpful to choose an evocative name— for instance, if you’re working in the space L2of square-integrable functions, it is natural to name each vector after the function it represents: |f/angbracketright. Then, for example, we can write the deﬁnition of a hermitian operator as we did in Equation 3.17: /angbracketleftBig f/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQf/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig ˆQf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglef/angbracketrightBig .3.6 Vectors and Operators 119 Strictly speaking, in Dirac notation this is a nonsense expression: fhere is a name , and operators act on vectors , not on names . The left side should properly be written as /angbracketleftBig f/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglef/angbracketrightBig , but what are we to make of the right side?/angbracketleftbigˆQf/vextendsingle/vextendsinglereally means “the bra dual to ˆQ|f/angbracketright,” but what is its name? I suppose we could say /angbracketleftBig/parenleftBig the name of the vector ˆQ|f/angbracketright/parenrightBig/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle, but that’s a mouthful. However, since we have chosen to name each vector after the function it represents, and since we doknow howˆQacts on the function (as opposed to the name )f,t h i s in fact becomes35 /angbracketleftˆQf|, and we are OK after all.36 An operator takes one vector in Hilbert space and delivers another: ˆQ|α/angbracketright=|β/angbracketright. (3.97) The sum of two operators is deﬁned in the obvious way, /parenleftBig ˆQ+ˆR/parenrightBig |α/angbracketright=ˆQ|α/angbracketright+ˆR|α/angbracketright, (3.98) and the product of two operators is ˆQˆR|α/angbracketright=ˆQ/parenleftBig ˆR|α/angbracketright/parenrightBig (3.99) (ﬁrst applyˆRto|α/angbracketright, and then apply ˆQto what you got—being careful, of course, to respect their ordering ). Occasionally we shall encounter functions of operators. They are typically deﬁned by the power series expansion: eˆQ≡1+ˆQ+1 2ˆQ2+1 3!ˆQ3+··· (3.100) 1 1−ˆQ≡1+ˆQ+ˆQ2+ˆQ3+ˆQ4+··· (3.101) ln/parenleftBig 1+ˆQ/parenrightBig ≡ˆQ−1 2ˆQ2+1 3ˆQ3−1 4ˆQ4+··· (3.102) and so on. On the right-hand side we have only sums and products, and we know how to handle them . Problem 3.23 Show that projection operators are idempotent :ˆP2=ˆP. Determine the eigenvalues of ˆP, and characterize its eigenvectors. 35Note that/angbracketleftˆQf|=/angbracketleft f|ˆQ†, by virtue of Equation 3.20. 36Like his delta function, Dirac’s notation is beautiful, powerful, and obedient. You can abuse it (everyone does), and it won’t bite. But once in a while you should pause to ask yourself what the symbols really mean.120 CHAPTER 3 Formalism Problem 3.24 Show that if an operator ˆQis hermitian, then its matrix elements in any orthonormal basis satisfy Qmn=Q∗ nm. That is, the corresponding matrix is equal to its transpose conjugate. Problem 3.25 The Hamiltonian for a certain two-level system is ˆH=/epsilon1(|1/angbracketright/angbracketleft1|−|2/angbracketright/angbracketleft2|+|1/angbracketright/angbracketleft2|+|2/angbracketright/angbracketleft1|), where|1/angbracketright,|2/angbracketrightis an orthonormal basis and /epsilon1is a number with the dimensions of energy. Find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors (as linear combinations of |1/angbracketrightand|2/angbracketright). What is the matrix HrepresentingˆHwith respect to this basis? ∗ Problem 3.26 Consider a three-dimensional vector space spanned by an orthonormal basis |1/angbracketright,|2/angbracketright,|3/angbracketright.K e t s|α/angbracketrightand|β/angbracketrightare given by |α/angbracketright=i|1/angbracketright−2|2/angbracketright−i|3/angbracketright,|β/angbracketright=i|1/angbracketright+2|3/angbracketright.

(a)Show thatˆQcan be written in terms of its spectral decomposition : ˆQ=/summationdisplay nqn|en/angbracketright/angbracketleften|.

(b)Show that/bracketleftBig eλˆA,ˆB/bracketrightBig =λeλˆAˆC, whereλis any complex number. Hint: Express eλˆAas a power series. (c)Derive the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula :37 eˆA+ˆB=eˆAeˆBe−ˆC/2. Hint: Deﬁne the functions ˆf(λ)=eλ/parenleftBig ˆA+ˆB/parenrightBig ,ˆg(λ)=eλˆAeλˆBe−λ2ˆC/2. Note that these functions are equal at λ=0, and show that they satisfy the same differential equation: dˆf/dλ=/parenleftBig ˆA+ˆB/parenrightBig ˆfanddˆg/dλ=/parenleftBig ˆA+ˆB/parenrightBig ˆg. Therefore, the functions are themselves equal for all λ.38 3.6.3 Changing Bases in Dirac Notation The advantage of Dirac notation is that it frees us from working in any particular basis, and makes transforming between bases seamless. Recall that the identity operator can be written as a projection onto a complete set of states (Equations 3.93 and3.96); of particular interest are the position eigenstates |x/angbracketright, the momentum eigenstates |p/angbracketright, and the energy eigenstates (we will assume those are discrete) |n/angbracketright: 37This is a special case of a more general formula that applies when ˆAandˆBdonotcommute with ˆC. See, for example, Eugen Merzbacher, Quantum Mechanics, 3rd edn, Wiley, New York (1998), page 40. 38The product rule holds for differentiating operators as long as you respect their order: d dλ/bracketleftBig ˆA(λ)ˆB(λ)/bracketrightBig =ˆA/prime(λ)ˆB(λ)+ˆA(λ)ˆB/prime(λ).

(3.107) Here we recognize the position-space, momentum-space, and “energy-space” wave functions (Equations 3.77–3.79)a st h e components of the vector|S(t)/angbracketrightin the respective bases. Example 3.9 Derive the transformation from the position-space wave function to the momentum-space wave function. (We already know the answer, of course, but I want to show you how this works out in Dirac notation.) Solution : We want to ﬁnd /Phi1(p,t)=/angbracketleftp|S(t)/angbracketrightgiven/Psi1(x,t)=/angbracketleftx|S(t)/angbracketright. We can relate the two by inserting a resolution of the identity: /Phi1(p,t)=/angbracketleftp|S(t)/angbracketright =/angbracketleftbigg p/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/parenleftbigg/integraldisplay dx|x/angbracketright/angbracketleftx|/parenrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleS(t)/angbracketrightbigg =/integraldisplay /angbracketleftp|x/angbracketright/angbracketleftx|S(t)/angbracketrightdx =/integraldisplay /angbracketleftp|x/angbracketright/Psi1(x,t)dx. (3.108) Now,/angbracketleftx|p/angbracketrightis the momentum eigenstate (with eigenvalue p) in the position basis—what we called fp(x), in Equation 3.32.S o /angbracketleftbig p/vextendsingle/vextendsinglex/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbig x/vextendsingle/vextendsinglep/angbracketrightbig∗=/bracketleftbig fp(x)/bracketrightbig∗=1√ 2π/planckover2pi1e−ip x//planckover2pi1. Plugging this into Equation 3.108 gives /Phi1(p,t)=/integraldisplay1√ 2π/planckover2pi1e−ip x//planckover2pi1/Psi1(x,t)dx, which is precisely Equation 3.54.3.6 Vectors and Operators 123 Just as the wave function takes different forms in different bases, so do operators. The position operator is given by ˆx→x in the position basis, or ˆx→i/planckover2pi1∂ ∂p in the momentum basis. However, Dirac notation allows us to do away with the arrows and stick to equalities. Operators act on kets (for instance, ˆx|S(t)/angbracketright); the outcome of this operation can be expressed in any basis by taking the inner product with an appropriate basis vector. That is, /angbracketleftbig x/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆx/vextendsingle/vextendsingleS(t)/angbracketrightbig =action of position operator in xbasis=x/Psi1(x,t), (3.109) or /angbracketleftbig p/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆx/vextendsingle/vextendsingleS(t)/angbracketrightbig =action of position operator in pbasis=i/planckover2pi1∂/Phi1 ∂p. (3.110) In this notation it is straightforward to transform operators between bases, as the following example illustrates. Example 3.10 Obtain the position operator in the momentum basis (Equation 3.110 ) by inserting a resolution of the identity on the left-hand side. Solution : /angbracketleftbig p/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆx/vextendsingle/vextendsingleS(t)/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbigg p/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆx/integraldisplay dx/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglex/angbracketrightbigg/angbracketleftbigg x/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleS(t)/angbracketrightbigg =/integraldisplay /angbracketleftp|x|x/angbracketright/angbracketleftx|S(t)/angbracketrightdx, where I’ve used the fact that |x/angbracketrightis an eigenstate of ˆx/parenleftbig ˆx|x/angbracketright=x|x/angbracketright/parenrightbig ;xcan then be pulled out of the inner product (it’s just a number) and /angbracketleftbig p/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆx/vextendsingle/vextendsingleS(t)/angbracketrightbig =/integraldisplay x/angbracketleftp|x/angbracketright/Psi1(x,t)dx =/integraldisplay xe−ip x//planckover2pi1 √ 2π/planckover2pi1/Psi1(x,t)dx =i/planckover2pi1∂ ∂p/integraldisplaye−ip x//planckover2pi1 √ 2π/planckover2pi1/Psi1(x,t)dx. Finally we recognize the integral as /Phi1(p,t)(Equation 3.54). Problem 3.30 Derive the transformation from the position-space wave function to the “energy-space” wave function (cn(t))using the technique of Example 3.9.

Hint: Use Equation 3.114 . As an example, ﬁnd Candφfor the wave function in Problem 2.40. Problem 3.41 A harmonic oscillator is in a state such that a measurement of the energy would yield either (1/2)/planckover2pi1ωor(3/2)/planckover2pi1ω, with equal probability.

Among the stationary states of the harmonic oscillator (Equation 2.68) only n=0 hits the uncertainty limit/parenleftbig σxσp=/planckover2pi1/2/parenrightbig ; in general,σxσp=(2n+1)/planckover2pi1/2, as you found in Problem 2.12. But certain linear combinations (known as coherent states ) also minimize the uncertainty product. They are (as it turns out) eigenfunctions of the lowering operator:42 a−|α/angbracketright=α|α/angbracketright (the eigenvalue αcan be any complex number). 42There are no normalizable eigenfunctions of the raising operator.Further Problems on Chapter 3 127 (a)Calculate/angbracketleftx/angbracketright,/angbracketleftbig x2/angbracketrightbig ,/angbracketleftp/angbracketright,/angbracketleftbig p2/angbracketrightbig in the state|α/angbracketright.Hint: Use the technique in Exam- ple2.5, and remember that a+is the hermitian conjugate of a−.D o notassumeα is real.

(e)Now put in the time dependence: |n/angbracketright→e−iEnt//planckover2pi1|n/angbracketright, and show that |α(t)/angbracketrightremains an eigenstate of a−, but the eigen value evolves in time: α(t)=e−iωtα. So a coherent state stays coherent, and continues to minimize the uncertainty product. (f)Based on your answers to (a), (b), and (e), ﬁnd /angbracketleftx/angbracketrightandσxas functions of time.

If you measured the energy of this state (at time t), what values might you get, and what is the probability of each? Answer the same questions for observables Aand for B. ∗∗ Problem 3.47 Supersymmetry. Consider the two operators ˆA=iˆp√ 2m+W(x)andˆA†=−iˆp√ 2m+W(x), (3.116) for some function W(x). These may be multiplied in either order to construct two Hamiltonians: ˆH1≡ˆA†ˆA=ˆp2 2m+V1(x)andˆH2≡ˆAˆA†=ˆp2 2m+V2(x); (3.117) V1andV2are called supersymmetric partner potentials . The energies and eigen- states ofˆH1andˆH2are related in interesting ways.44 (a)Find the potentials V1(x)andV2(x), in terms of the superpotential ,W(x). (b)Show that ifψ(1) nis an eigenstate of ˆH1with eigenvalue E(1) n, thenˆAψ(1) nis an eigenstate of ˆH2with the same eigenvalue. Similarly, show that if ψ(2) n(x)is an eigenstate of ˆH2with eigenvalue E(2) n, thenˆA†ψ(2) nis an eigenstate of ˆH1with the same eigenvalue. The two Hamiltonians therefore have essentially identical spectra. (c)One ordinarily chooses W(x)such that the ground state of ˆH1satisﬁes ˆAψ(1) 0(x)=0, (3.118) and hence E(1) 0=0. Use this to ﬁnd the superpotential W(x), in terms of the ground state wave function, ψ(1) 0(x). (The fact that ˆAannihilatesψ(1) 0means that ˆH2actually has one less eigenstate than ˆH1, and is missing the eigenvalue E(1) 0.) (d)Consider the Dirac delta function well, V1(x)=mα2 2/planckover2pi12−αδ(x), (3.119) (the constant term, mα2/2/planckover2pi12, is included so that E(1) 0=0). It has a single bound state (Equation 2.132 ) ψ(1) 0(x)=√mα /planckover2pi1exp/bracketleftBig −mα /planckover2pi12|x|/bracketrightBig . (3.120) Use the results of parts (a) and (c), and Problem 2.23(b), to determine the super- potential W(x)and the partner potential V2(x). This partner potential is one that you will likely recognize, and while it has no bound states, the supersymmetry between these two systems explains the fact that their reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients are identical (see the last paragraph of Section 2.5.2 ). 44Fred Cooper, Avinash Khare, and Uday Sukhatme, Supersymmetry in Quantum Mechanics , World Scientiﬁc, Singapore, 2001.130 CHAPTER 3 Formalism ∗∗ Problem 3.48 An operator is deﬁned not just by its action (what it does to the vector it is applied to) but its domain (the set of vectors on which it acts). In a ﬁnite -dimensional vector space the domain is the entire space, and we don’t need to worry about it. But for most operators in Hilbert space the domain is restricted. In particular, only functions such that ˆQf(x)remains in Hilbert space are allowed in the domain of ˆQ. (As you found in Problem 3.2, the derivative operator can knock a function out of L2.) A hermitian operator is one whose action is the same as that of its adjoint45(Problem 3.5). But what is required to represent observables is actually something more: the domains ofˆQandˆQ†must alsobe identical. Such operators are called self-adjoint .46 (a)Consider the momentum operator, ˆp=−i/planckover2pi1d/dx, on the ﬁnite interval 0 ≤x≤a. With the inﬁnite square well in mind, we might deﬁne its domain as the set of functions f(x)such that f(0)=f(a)=0 (it goes without saying that f(x) andˆpf(x)are in L2(0,a)). Show thatˆpis hermitian:/angbracketleftbig g/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆpf/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbig ˆp†g/vextendsingle/vextendsinglef/angbracketrightbig , with ˆp†=ˆp. But is it self-adjoint? Hint: as long as f(0)=f(a)=0, there is no restriction on g(0)org(a)—the domain of ˆp†is much larger than the domain of ˆp.47 (b)Suppose we extend the domain of ˆpto include all functions of the form f(a)= λf(0), for some ﬁxed complex number λ. What condition must we then impose on the domain of ˆp†in order thatˆpbe hermitian? What value(s) of λwill renderˆp self-adjoint? Comment: Technically, then, there isno momentum operator on the ﬁnite interval—or rather, there are inﬁnitely many, and no way to decide which of them is “correct.” (In Problem 3.34 we avoided the issue by working on the inﬁnite interval.) (c)What about the semi-inﬁnite interval, 0 ≤x<∞? Is there a self-adjoint momentum operator in this case?48 ∗∗ Problem 3.49 (a)Write down the time-dependent “Schrödinger equation” in momentum space, for a free particle, and solve it. Answer: exp/parenleftbig −ip2t/2m/planckover2pi1/parenrightbig /Phi1(p,0). (b)Find/Phi1(p,0)for the traveling gaussian wave packet (Problem 2.42), and construct /Phi1(p,t)for this case. Also construct |/Phi1(p,t)|2, and note that it is independent of time. (c)Calculate/angbracketleftp/angbracketrightand/angbracketleftbig p2/angbracketrightbig by evaluating the appropriate integrals involving /Phi1, and compare your answers to Problem 2.42. (d)Show that/angbracketleftH/angbracketright=/angbracketleftp/angbracketright2/2m+/angbracketleftH/angbracketright0(where the subscript 0 denotes the stationary gaussian), and comment on this result. 45Mathematicians call them “symmetric” operators. 46Because the distinction rarely intrudes, physicists tend to use the word “hermitian” indiscriminately; technically, we should always say “self-adjoint,” meaning ˆQ=ˆQ†both in action and in domain. 47The domain of ˆQis something we stipulate ;t h a t determines the domain of ˆQ†. 48J. von Neumann introduced machinery for generating self-adjoint extensions of hermitian operators—or in some cases proving that they cannot exist.

Thus i/planckover2pi1∂/Psi1 ∂t=−/planckover2pi12 2m∇2/Psi1+V/Psi1, (4.4) where ∇2≡∂2 ∂x2+∂2 ∂y2+∂2 ∂z2, (4.5) is the Laplacian , in cartesian coordinates. The potential energy Vand the wave function /Psi1are now functions of r=(x,y,z) andt. The probability of ﬁnding the particle in the inﬁnitesimal volume d3r=dx dydz is |/Psi1(r,t)|2d3r, and the normalization condition reads /integraldisplay |/Psi1|2d3r=1, (4.6) with the integral taken over all space.

(4.11) (Each of these, of course, stands for three equations—one for each component.) Hint: First check that the “generalized” Ehrenfest theorem, Equation 3.73, is valid in three dimensions. (c)Formulate Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle in three dimensions. Answer: σxσpx≥/planckover2pi1/2,σ yσpy≥/planckover2pi1/2,σ zσpz≥/planckover2pi1/2, (4.12) but there is no restriction on, say, σxσpy. ∗ Problem 4.2 Use separation of variables in cartesian coordinates to solve the inﬁnite cubical well (or “particle in a box”): V(x,y,z)=/braceleftBigg 0, x,y,zall between 0 and a; ∞,otherwise.

Comment :I nonedimension degenerate bound states do not occur (see Problem 2.44), but in three dimensions they are very common. (c)What is the degeneracy of E14, and why is this case interesting? 4.1.1 Spherical Coordinates Most of the applications we will encounter involve central potentials ,f o rw h i c h Vis a func- tion only of the distance from the origin, V(r)→V(r). In that case it is natural to adopt4.1 The Schrödinger Equation 133 φ r θθ φz xyrP Figure 4.1: Spherical coordinates: radius r, polar angleθ, and azimuthal angle φ. spherical coordinates ,(r,θ,φ)(Figure 4.1). In spherical coordinates the Laplacian takes the form1 ∇2=1 r2∂ ∂r/parenleftbigg r2∂ ∂r/parenrightbigg +1 r2sinθ∂ ∂θ/parenleftbigg sinθ∂ ∂θ/parenrightbigg +1 r2sin2θ/parenleftbigg∂2 ∂φ2/parenrightbigg . (4.13) In spherical coordinates, then, the time-independent Schrödinger equation reads −/planckover2pi12 2m/bracketleftbigg1 r2∂ ∂r/parenleftbigg r2∂ψ ∂r/parenrightbigg +1 r2sinθ∂ ∂θ/parenleftbigg sinθ∂ψ ∂θ/parenrightbigg +1 r2sin2θ/parenleftbigg∂2ψ ∂φ2/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg +Vψ=Eψ. (4.14) We begin by looking for solutions that are separable into products (a function of rtimes a function ofθandφ): ψ(r,θ,φ)=R(r)Y(θ,φ). (4.15) Putting this into Equation 4.14,w eh a v e −/planckover2pi12 2m/bracketleftbiggY r2d dr/parenleftbigg r2dR dr/parenrightbigg +R r2sinθ∂ ∂θ/parenleftbigg sinθ∂Y ∂θ/parenrightbigg +R r2sin2θ∂2Y ∂φ2/bracketrightbigg +VR Y=ERY.

Boas, Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences 3rd edn, Wiley, New York (2006), Chapter 10, Section 9.134 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions The term in the ﬁrst curly bracket depends only on r, whereas the remainder depends only on θandφ; accordingly, each must be a constant. For reasons that will appear in due course,2I will write this “separation constant” in the form /lscript(/lscript+1): 1 Rd dr/parenleftbigg r2dR dr/parenrightbigg −2mr2 /planckover2pi12[V(r)−E]=/lscript(/lscript+1); (4.16) 1 Y/braceleftbigg1 sinθ∂ ∂θ/parenleftbigg sinθ∂Y ∂θ/parenrightbigg +1 sin2θ∂2Y ∂φ2/bracerightbigg =−/lscript(/lscript+1). (4.17) Problem 4.3 (a)Supposeψ(r,θ,φ)=Ae−r/a, for some constants Aanda.F i n d EandV(r), assuming V(r)→0a sr→∞ . (b)Do the same for ψ(r,θ,φ)=Ae−r2/a2, assuming V(0)=0. 4.1.2 The Angular Equation Equation 4.17 determines the dependence of ψonθandφ; multiplying by Ysin2θ, it becomes: sinθ∂ ∂θ/parenleftbigg sinθ∂Y ∂θ/parenrightbigg +∂2Y ∂φ2=−/lscript(/lscript+1)sin2θY. (4.18) You might recognize this equation—it occurs in the solution to Laplace’s equation in classical electrodynamics. As always, we solve it by separation of variables: Y(θ,φ)=/Theta1(θ)/Phi1(φ). (4.19) Plugging this in, and dividing by /Theta1/Phi1, /braceleftbigg1 /Theta1/bracketleftbigg sinθd dθ/parenleftbigg sinθd/Theta1 dθ/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg +/lscript(/lscript+1)sin2θ/bracerightbigg +1 /Phi1d2/Phi1 dφ2=0. The ﬁrst term is a function only of θ, and the second is a function only of φ, so each must be a constant. This time3I’ll call the separation constant m2: 1 /Theta1/bracketleftbigg sinθd dθ/parenleftbigg sinθd/Theta1 dθ/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg +/lscript(/lscript+1)sin2θ=m2; (4.20) 1 /Phi1d2/Phi1 dφ2=−m2. (4.21) Theφequation is easy: d2/Phi1 dφ2=−m2/Phi1⇒/Phi1(φ)=eimφ. (4.22) 2Note that there is no loss of generality here—at this stage /lscriptcould be any complex number. Later on we’ll discover that/lscriptmust in fact be an integer , and it is in anticipation of that result that I express the separation constant in a way that looks peculiar now. 3Again, there is no loss of generality here, since at this stage mcould be any complex number; in a moment, though, we will discover that mmust in fact be an integer .Beware: The letter mis now doing double duty, as mass and as a separation constant. There is no graceful way to avoid this confusion, since both uses are standard. Some authors now switch to Morμfor mass, but I hate to change notation in mid-stream, and I don’t think confusion will arise, a long as you are aware of the problem.4.1 The Schrödinger Equation 135 Actually, there are twosolutions: exp(imφ)and exp(−imφ), but we’ll cover the latter by allowing mto run negative. There could also be a constant factor in front, but we might as well absorb that into /Theta1. Incidentally, in electrodynamics we would write the azimuthal func- tion(/Phi1)in terms of sines and cosines, instead of exponentials, because electric ﬁelds are real. But there is no such constraint on the wave function, and exponentials are a lot easier to work with. Now, when φadvances by 2π, we return to the same point in space (see Figure 4.1), so it is natural to require that4 /Phi1(φ+2π)=/Phi1(φ). (4.23) In other words, exp [im(φ+2π)]=exp(imφ),o re x p(2πim)=1. From this it follows that m must be an integer : m=0,±1,±2,....

As the name suggests, P/lscript(x)is a polynomial (of degree /lscript)i nx, and is even or odd according to the parity of /lscript.B u t Pm /lscript(x)is not, in general, a polynomial6—ifmis odd it carries a factor of√ 1−x2: 4This is more slippery than it looks. After all, the probability density (|/Phi1|2) is single valued regardless ofm.I n Section 4.3we’ll obtain the condition on mby an entirely different—and more compelling—argument. 5Some books (including earlier editions of this one) do not include the factor (−1)min the deﬁnition of Pm /lscript. Equation 4.27 assumes that m≥0; for negative values we deﬁne P−m /lscript(x)=(−1)m(/lscript−m)! (/lscript+m)!Pm /lscript(x). A few books (including earlier versions of this one) deﬁne P−m /lscript=Pm /lscript. I am adopting now the more standard convention used by Mathematica. 6Nevertheless, some authors call them (confusingly) “associated Legendre polynomials.”136 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions Table 4.1: The ﬁrst few Legendre polynomials, P /lscript(x): (a) functional form, (b) graph. x −1 10.51 −1P0 P2P1 P3 (b) (a)P0=1 P1=x P2= P3= P4= P5=(3x2−1)1 2 1 2 1 8 1 8(5x3−3x) (35x4−30x2+3) (63x5−70x3+15x) P0 2(x)=1 2/parenleftBig 3x2−1/parenrightBig ,P1 2(x)=−/parenleftBig 1−x2/parenrightBig1/2d dx/bracketleftbigg1 2/parenleftBig 3x2−1/parenrightBig/bracketrightbigg =−3x/radicalbig 1−x2, P2 2(x)=/parenleftBig 1−x2/parenrightBig/parenleftbiggd dx/parenrightbigg2/bracketleftbigg1 2/parenleftBig 3x2−1/parenrightBig/bracketrightbigg =3/parenleftBig 1−x2/parenrightBig , etc. (On the other hand, what weneed is Pm /lscript(cosθ), and√ 1−cos2θ=sinθ,s oPm /lscript(cosθ) is always a polynomial in cos θ, multiplied—if mis odd—by sinθ. Some associated Legendre functions of cos θare listed in Table 4.2.) Notice that/lscriptmust be a non-negative integer , for the Rodrigues formula to make any sense; moreover, if m>/lscript, then Equation 4.27 says Pm /lscript=0. For any given /lscript, then, there are (2/lscript+1) possible values of m: /lscript=0,1,2,...;m=−/lscript,−/lscript+1,...,−1,0,1,...,/lscript−1,/lscript . (4.29) But wait! Equation 4.25 is a second-order differential equation: It should have twolinearly independent solutions, for any old values of/lscriptandm. Where are all the other solutions? Answer :T h e y exist, of course, as mathematical solutions to the equation, but they are physically unacceptable, because they blow up at θ=0 and/orθ=π(see Problem 4.5). Now, the volume element in spherical coordinates7is d3r=r2sinθdr dθdφ=r2dr d/Omega1, where d/Omega1≡sinθdθdφ, (4.30) so the normalization condition (Equation 4.6) becomes /integraldisplay |ψ|2r2sinθdr dθdφ=/integraldisplay |R|2r2dr/integraldisplay |Y|2d/Omega1=1.

(4.34) Hint: Use integration by parts. 4.1.3 The Radial Equation Notice that the angular part of the wave function, Y(θ,φ),i st h es a m ef o r allspherically sym- metric potentials; the actual shape of the potential, V(r), affects only the radial part of the wave function, R(r), which is determined by Equation 4.16: d dr/parenleftbigg r2dR dr/parenrightbigg −2mr2 /planckover2pi12[V(r)−E]R=/lscript(/lscript+1)R. (4.35) This simpliﬁes if we change variables: Let u(r)≡rR(r), (4.36) so that R=u/r,dR/dr=/bracketleftbig r(du/dr)−u/bracketrightbig /r2,(d/dr)/bracketleftbig r2(dR/dr)/bracketrightbig =rd2u/dr2, and hence −/planckover2pi12 2md2u dr2+/bracketleftbigg V+/planckover2pi12 2m/lscript(/lscript+1) r2/bracketrightbigg u=Eu. (4.37) This is called the radial equation ;9it isidentical in form to the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation (Equation 2.5), except that the effective potential , Veff=V+/planckover2pi12 2m/lscript(/lscript+1) r2, (4.38) 9Those msa r e masses , of course—the separation constant mdoes not appear in the radial equation.4.1 The Schrödinger Equation 139 contains an extra piece, the so-called centrifugal term ,/parenleftbig /planckover2pi12/2m/parenrightbig/bracketleftbig /lscript(/lscript+1)/r2/bracketrightbig . It tends to throw the particle outward (away from the origin), just like the centrifugal (pseudo-)force in classical mechanics. Meanwhile, the normalization condition (Equation 4.31) becomes /integraldisplay∞ 0|u|2dr=1. (4.39) That’s as far as we can go until a speciﬁc potential V(r)is provided. Example 4.1 Consider the inﬁnite spherical well , V(r)=/braceleftBigg 0,r≤a; ∞,r>a.(4.40) Find the wave functions and the allowed energies. Solution: Outside the well the wave function is zero; inside the well, the radial equation says d2u dr2=/bracketleftbigg/lscript(/lscript+1) r2−k2/bracketrightbigg u, (4.41) where k≡√ 2mE /planckover2pi1. (4.42) Our problem is to solve Equation 4.41, subject to the boundary condition u(a)=0. The case/lscript=0 is easy: d2u dr2=−k2u⇒u(r)=Asin(kr)+Bcos(kr). But remember, the actual radial wave function is R(r)=u(r)/r, and [cos(kr)]/rblows up as r→0. So10B=0. The boundary condition then requires sin (ka)=0, and hence ka=Nπ, for some integer N. The allowed energies are EN0=N2π2/planckover2pi12 2ma2,(N=1,2,3,...) (4.43) (same as for the one-dimensional inﬁnite square well, Equation 2.30). Normalizing u(r) yields A=√2/a: uN0=/radicalbigg 2 asin/parenleftbiggNπr a/parenrightbigg . (4.44) Notice that the radial wave function has N−1 nodes (or, if you prefer, N“lobes”). The general solution to Equation 4.41 (for an arbitrary integer/lscript) is not so familiar: u(r)=Ar j/lscript(kr)+Brn/lscript(kr), (4.45) 10Actually, all we require is that the wave function be normalizable , not that it be ﬁnite :R(r)∼1/rat the origin isnormalizable (because of the r2in Equation 4.31). For a compelling general argument that u(0)=0, see Ramamurti Shankar, Principles of Quantum Mechanics , 2nd edn (Plenum, New York, 1994), p. 342. For further discussion see F. A. B. Coutinho and M. Amaku, Eur. J. Phys. 30, 1015 (2009).140 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions where j/lscript(x)is the spherical Bessel function of order/lscript, and n/lscript(x)is the spherical Neumann function of order/lscript. They are deﬁned as follows: j/lscript(x)≡(−x)/lscript/parenleftbigg1 xd dx/parenrightbigg/lscriptsinx x;n/lscript(x)≡−(−x)/lscript/parenleftbigg1 xd dx/parenrightbigg/lscriptcosx x. (4.46) For example, j0(x)=sinx x;n0(x)=−cosx x; j1(x)=(−x)1 xd dx/parenleftbiggsinx x/parenrightbigg =sinx x2−cosx x; j2(x)=(−x)2/parenleftbigg1 xd dx/parenrightbigg2sinx x=x2/parenleftbigg1 xd dx/parenrightbiggxcosx−sinx x3 =3s i n x−3xcosx−x2sinx x3; and so on. The ﬁrst few spherical Bessel and Neumann functions are listed in Table 4.4. For small x(where sin x=x−x3/3!+x5/5!−··· and cos x=1−x2/2+x4/4!−··· ), j0(x)≈1;n0(x)≈1 x;j1(x)≈x 3;j2(x)≈x2 15; etc. Notice that Bessel functions are ﬁnite at the origin, but Neumann functions blow up at the origin. Accordingly, B/lscript=0, and hence R(r)=Aj/lscript(kr). (4.47) There remains the boundary condition, R(a)=0. Evidently kmust be chosen such that j/lscript(ka)=0; (4.48) that is,(ka)is a zero of the/lscriptth-order spherical Bessel function. Now, the Bessel functions are oscillatory (see Figure 4.2); each one has an inﬁnite number of zeros. But (unfortu- nately for us) they are not located at nice sensible points (such as multiples of π); they have to be computed numerically.11At any rate, the boundary condition requires that k=1 aβN/lscript, (4.49) whereβN/lscriptis the Nth zero of the/lscriptth spherical Bessel function. The allowed energies, then, are given by EN/lscript=/planckover2pi12 2ma2β2 N/lscript. (4.50) It is customary to introduce the principal quantum number ,n, which simply orders the allowed energies, starting with 1 for the ground state (see Figure 4.3). The wave functions are 11Milton Abramowitz and Irene A.

In the special case of the Coulomb potential, as we shall see, there is a delightfully simple formula relating the two.142 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions N = 1N = 2N = 3 n = 8 n = 7 n = 6 n = 4n = 5 n = 3 n = 2 n = 1 = 0 = 1 = 2 = 3 = 4 Figure 4.3: Energy levels of the inﬁnite spherical well (Equation 4.50). States with the same value ofNare connected by dashed lines. Notice that the energy levels are (2/lscript+1)-fold degenerate, since there are (2/lscript+1)dif- ferent values of mfor each value of /lscript(see Equation 4.29). This is the degeneracy to be expected for a spherically symmetric potential, since mdoes not appear in the radial equa- tion (which determines the energy). But in some cases (most famously the hydrogen atom) there is extra degeneracy, due to coincidences in the energy levels not attributable to spher- ical symmetry alone. The deeper reason for such “accidental” degeneracy is intriguing, as we shall see in Chapter 6. Problem 4.9 (a)From the deﬁnition (Equation 4.46), construct n1(x)andn2(x).

Find the ground state, by solving the radial equation with /lscript=0. Show that there is no bound state if V0a2<π2/planckover2pi12/8m. 4.2 THE HYDROGEN ATOM The hydrogen atom consists of a heavy, essentially motionless proton (we may as well put it at the origin), of charge e, together with a much lighter electron (mass me, charge−e) that orbits around it, bound by the mutual attraction of opposite charges (see Figure 4.4). From Coulomb’s law, the potential energy of the electron13(in SI units) is V(r)=−e2 4π/epsilon101 r, (4.52) and the radial equation (Equation 4.37) says −/planckover2pi12 2med2u dr2+/bracketleftbigg −e2 4π/epsilon101 r+/planckover2pi12 2me/lscript(/lscript+1) r2/bracketrightbigg u=Eu. (4.53) (The effective potential—the term in square brackets—is shown in Figure 4.5.) Our problem is to solve this equation for u(r), and determine the allowed energies. The hydrogen atom is such an important case that I’m not going to hand you the solutions this time—we’ll work them out in detail, by the method we used in the analytical solution to the harmonic oscillator. (If any step in this process is unclear, you may want to refer back to Section 2.3.2 for a more complete explanation.) Incidentally, the Coulomb potential (Equation 4.52) admits continuum states (with E>0), describing electron-proton scattering, as well as discrete bound states, representing the hydrogen atom, but we shall conﬁne our attention to the latter.14 r +e (proton)−e (electron) Figure 4.4: The hydrogen atom. 13This is what goes into the Schrödinger equation—not the electric potential(e/4π/epsilon10r). 14Note, however, that the bound states by themselves are not complete.144 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions Veff r Figure 4.5: The effective potential for hydrogen (Equation 4.53), if/lscript>0. 4.2.1 The Radial Wave Function Our ﬁrst task is to tidy up the notation. Let κ≡√−2meE /planckover2pi1. (4.54) (For bound states, Eis negative, soκisreal.) Dividing Equation 4.53 byE,w eh a v e 1 κ2d2u dr2=/bracketleftbigg 1−mee2 2π/epsilon10/planckover2pi12κ1 (κr)+/lscript(/lscript+1) (κr)2/bracketrightbigg u. This suggests that we introduce ρ≡κr,andρ0≡mee2 2π/epsilon10/planckover2pi12κ, (4.55) so that d2u dρ2=/bracketleftbigg 1−ρ0 ρ+/lscript(/lscript+1) ρ2/bracketrightbigg u. (4.56) Next we examine the asymptotic form of the solutions. As ρ→∞ , the constant term in the brackets dominates, so (approximately) d2u dρ2=u. The general solution is u(ρ)=Ae−ρ+Beρ, (4.57) buteρblows up (asρ→∞ ), so B=0. Evidently, u(ρ)∼Ae−ρ, (4.58) for largeρ. On the other hand, as ρ→0 the centrifugal term dominates;15approximately, then: d2u dρ2=/lscript(/lscript+1) ρ2u. The general solution (check it!) is u(ρ)=Cρ/lscript+1+Dρ−/lscript, 15This argument does not apply when /lscript=0 (although the conclusion, Equation 4.59, is in fact valid for that case too). But never mind: All I am trying to do is provide some motivation for a change of variables (Equation 4.60).4.2 The Hydrogen Atom 145 butρ−/lscriptblows up (asρ→0), so D=0. Thus u(ρ)∼Cρ/lscript+1, (4.59) for smallρ. The next step is to peel off the asymptotic behavior, introducing the new function v(ρ): u(ρ)=ρ/lscript+1e−ρv(ρ), (4.60) in the hope that v(ρ)will turn out to be simpler than u(ρ). The ﬁrst indications are not auspicious: du dρ=ρ/lscripte−ρ/bracketleftbigg (/lscript+1−ρ)v+ρdv dρ/bracketrightbigg , and d2u dρ2=ρ/lscripte−ρ/braceleftbigg/bracketleftbigg −2/lscript−2+ρ+/lscript(/lscript+1) ρ/bracketrightbigg v+2(/lscript+1−ρ)dv dρ+ρd2v dρ2/bracerightbigg . In terms ofv(ρ), then, the radial equation (Equation 4.56) reads ρd2v dρ2+2(/lscript+1−ρ)dv dρ+[ρ0−2(/lscript+1)]v=0. (4.61) Finally, we assume the solution, v(ρ), can be expressed as a power series in ρ: v(ρ)=∞/summationdisplay j=0cjρj. (4.62) Our problem is to determine the coefﬁcients (c0,c1,c2,...). Differentiating term by term: dv dρ=∞/summationdisplay j=0jcjρj−1=∞/summationdisplay j=0(j+1)cj+1ρj. (In the second summation I have renamed the “dummy index”: j→j+1. If this troubles you, write out the ﬁrst few terms explicitly, and check it. You may object that the sum should now begin at j=−1, but the factor (j+1)kills that term anyway, so we might as well start at zero.) Differentiating again, d2v dρ2=∞/summationdisplay j=0j(j+1)cj+1ρj−1. Inserting these into Equation 4.61, ∞/summationdisplay j=0j(j+1)cj+1ρj+2(/lscript+1)∞/summationdisplay j=0j(j+1)cj+1ρj −2∞/summationdisplay j=0jcjρj+[ρ0−2(/lscript+1)]∞/summationdisplay j=0cjρj=0. Equating the coefﬁcients of like powers yields j(j+1)cj+1+2(/lscript+1)(j+1)cj+1−2jcj+[ρ0−2(/lscript+1)]cj=0,146 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions or: cj+1=/braceleftbigg2(j+/lscript+1)−ρ0 (j+1)(j+2/lscript+2)/bracerightbigg cj. (4.63) This recursion formula determines the coefﬁcients, and hence the function v(ρ): We start with c0(this becomes an overall constant, to be ﬁxed eventually by normalization), and Equation 4.63 gives us c1; putting this back in, we obtain c2, and so on.16 Now let’s see what the coefﬁcients look like for large j(this corresponds to large ρ, where the higher powers dominate). In this regime the recursion formula says17 cj+1≈2j j(j+1)cj=2 j+1cj, so cj≈2j j!c0. (4.64) Suppose for a moment that this were the exact result. Then v(ρ)=c0∞/summationdisplay j=02j j!ρj=c0e2ρ, and hence u(ρ)=c0ρl+1eρ, (4.65) which blows up at large ρ. The positive exponential is precisely the asymptotic behavior we didn’t want, in Equation 4.57. (It’s no accident that it reappears here; after all, it does represent the asymptotic form of some solutions to the radial equation—they just don’t happen to be the ones we’re interested in, because they aren’t normalizable.) There is only one escape from this dilemma: The series must terminate . There must occur some integer Nsuch that cN−1/negationslash=0b u t cN=0 (4.66) (beyond this all coefﬁcients vanish automatically).18In that case Equation 4.63 says 2(N+/lscript)−ρ0=0. Deﬁning n≡N+/lscript, (4.67) 16You might wonder why I didn’t use the series method directly on u(ρ)—why factor out the asymptotic behav- ior before applying this procedure? Well, the reason for peeling off ρ/lscript+1is largely aesthetic: Without this, the sequence would begin with a long string of zeros (the ﬁrst nonzero coefﬁcient being c/lscript+1); by factoring out ρ/lscript+1 we obtain a series that starts out with ρ0.T h e e−ρfactor is more critical—if you don’t pull that out, you get a three-term recursion formula, involving cj+2,cj+1andcj(tryit!), and that is enormously more difﬁcult to work with. 17Why not drop the 1 in j+1? After all, I’m ignoring 2 (/lscript+1)−ρ0in the numerator, and 2 /lscript+2 in the denominator. In this approximation it would be ﬁne to drop the 1 as well, but keeping it makes the argument a little cleaner. Try doing it without the 1, and you’ll see what I mean. 18This makesv(ρ)a polynomial of order (N−1), with (therefore) N−1 roots, and hence the radial wave function hasN−1 nodes.4.2 The Hydrogen Atom 147 we have ρ0=2n. (4.68) Butρ0determines E(Equations 4.54 and4.55): E=−/planckover2pi12κ2 2m=−mee4 8π2/epsilon12 0/planckover2pi12ρ2 0, (4.69) so the allowed energies are En=−/bracketleftBigg me 2/planckover2pi12/parenleftbigge2 4π/epsilon10/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg 1 n2=E1 n2,n=1,2,3,.... (4.70) This is the famous Bohr formula —by any measure the most important result in all of quan- tum mechanics. Bohr obtained it in 1913 by a serendipitous mixture of inapplicable classical physics and premature quantum theory (the Schrödinger equation did not come until 1926). Combining Equations 4.55 and4.68, we ﬁnd that κ=/parenleftbiggmee2 4π/epsilon10/planckover2pi12/parenrightbigg1 n=1 an, (4.71) where a≡4π/epsilon10/planckover2pi12 mee2=0.529×10−10m (4.72) is the so-called Bohr radius .19It follows (again, from Equation 4.55) that ρ=r an. (4.73) The spatial wave functions are labeled by three quantum numbers ( n,/lscript, and m):20 ψn/lscriptm(r,θ,φ)=Rn/lscript(r)Ym /lscript(θ,φ), (4.74) where (referring back to Equations 4.36 and4.60) Rn/lscript(r)=1 rρ/lscript+1e−ρv(ρ), (4.75) andv(ρ)is a polynomial of degree n−/lscript−1i nρ, whose coefﬁcients are determined (up to an overall normalization factor) by the recursion formula cj+1=2(j+/lscript+1−n) (j+1)(j+2/lscript+2)cj. (4.76) 19It is customary to write the Bohr radius with a subscript: a0. But this is cumbersome and unnecessary, so I prefer to leave the subscript off. 20Again, nis the principal quantum number ; it tells you the energy of the electron (Equation 4.70). For unfortunate historical reasons /lscriptis called the azimuthal quantum number andmthemagnetic quantum number ; as we’ll see in Section 4.3, they are related to the angular momentum of the electron.148 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions The ground state (that is, the state of lowest energy) is the case n=1; putting in the accepted values for the physical constants, we get:21 E1=−/bracketleftBigg me 2/planckover2pi12/parenleftbigge2 4π/epsilon10/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg =−13.6e V. (4.77) In other words, the binding energy of hydrogen (the amount of energy you would have to impart to the electron in its ground state in order to ionize the atom) is 13.6 eV . Equation 4.67 forces/lscript=0, whence also m=0( s e eE q u a t i o n 4.29), so ψ100(r,θ,φ)=R10(r)Y0 0(θ,φ). (4.78) The recursion formula truncates after the ﬁrst term (Equation 4.76 with j=0 yields c1=0), sov(ρ)is a constant(c0), and R10(r)=c0 ae−r/a.

If/lscript=0, the recursion relation (Equation 4.76)g i v e s c1=−c0(using j=0),andc2=0(using j=1), sov(ρ)=c0(1−ρ), and therefore R20(r)=c0 2a/parenleftBig 1−r 2a/parenrightBig e−r/2a.

(4.83) (In each case the constant c0is to be determined by normalization—see Problem 4.13.) 21Anelectron volt is the energy acquired by an electron when accelerated through an electric potential of 1 volt: 1 eV = 1.60×10−19J.4.2 The Hydrogen Atom 149 For arbitrary n, the possible values of /lscript(consistent with Equation 4.67)a r e /lscript=0,1,2,..., n−1, (4.84) and for each/lscriptthere are(2/lscript+1)possible values of m(Equation 4.29), so the total degeneracy of the energy level Enis d(n)=n−1/summationdisplay /lscript=0(2/lscript+1)=n2.

(With Equation 4.67,/lscriptdropped out of sight, in the derivation of the allowed energies, though it does still affect the wave functions.) This is what gives rise to the “extra” degeneracy of the Coulomb potential, as compared to what you would expect from spherical symmetry alone ( n2=1,4,9,16,..., as opposed to(2/lscript+1)=1,3,5,7,...). The polynomial v(ρ)(deﬁned by the recursion formula, Equation 4.76) is a function well known to applied mathematicians; apart from normalization, it can be written as v(ρ)=L2/lscript+1 n−/lscript−1(2ρ), (4.86) where Lp q(x)≡(−1)p/parenleftbiggd dx/parenrightbiggp Lp+q(x) (4.87) N = 1N = 2N = 3N = 5Scattering States ( E > 0) Bound States ( E < 0)N = 4 n = 1n = 2n = 3n = 4n = 5n = ∞ = 0 = 1 = 2 = 3 = 4 = 5 Figure 4.6: Energy levels for hydrogen (Equation 4.70);n=1 is the ground state, with E1=−13.6e V ; an inﬁnite number of states are squeezed in between n=5a n d n=∞ ;E∞=0 separates the bound states from the scattering states.

The normalized hydrogen wave functions are23 22As usual, there are rival normalization conventions in the literature. Older physics books (including earlier edi- tions of this one) leave off the factor (1/q!). But I think it is best to adopt the Mathematica standard (which sets Lq(0)=1). As the names suggest, Lq(x)andLp q(x)are polynomials (of degree q)i nx. Incidentally, the associated Laguerre polynomials can also be written in the form Lp q(x)=x−pex q!/parenleftbiggd dx/parenrightbiggq/parenleftbig e−xxp+q/parenrightbig . 23If you want to see how the normalization factor is calculated, study (for example), Leonard I.

(4.90) This follows from the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics (Equation 4.33) and (for n/negationslash= n/prime) from the fact that they are eigenfunctions of ˆHwith distinct eigenvalues. Visualizing the hydrogen wave functions is not easy. Chemists like to draw density plots , in which the brightness of the cloud is proportional to |ψ|2(Figure 4.8). More quantitative (but perhaps harder to decipher) are surfaces of constant probability density (Figure 4.9). The quantum numbers n,/lscript, and mcan be identiﬁed from the nodes of the wave function. The number of radial nodes is, as always, given by N−1 (for hydrogen this is n−/lscript−1). For each radial node the wave function vanishes on a sphere, as can be seen in Figure 4.8.

However, if you tickle it slightly (by collision with another atom, say, or by shin- ing light on it), the atom may undergo a transition to some other stationary state—either by absorbing energy, and moving up to a higher-energy state, or by giving off energy (typically in the form of electromagnetic radiation), and moving down.26In practice such perturbations are always present; transitions (or, as they are sometimes called, quantum jumps ) are constantly occurring, and the result is that a container of hydrogen gives off light ( photons ), whose energy corresponds to the difference in energy between the initial and ﬁnal states: Eγ=Ei−Ef=−13.6e V/parenleftBigg 1 n2 i−1 n2 f/parenrightBigg . (4.91) Now, according to the Planck formula ,27the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency: Eγ=hν. (4.92) Meanwhile, the wavelength is given byλ=c/ν,s o 1 λ=R/parenleftBigg 1 n2 f−1 n2 i/parenrightBigg , (4.93) where R≡me 4πc/planckover2pi13/parenleftbigge2 4π/epsilon10/parenrightbigg2 =1.097×107m−1(4.94) is known as the Rydberg constant . Equation 4.93 is the Rydberg formula for the spectrum of hydrogen; it was discovered empirically in the nineteenth century, and the greatest triumph of Bohr’s theory was its ability to account for this result—and to calculate Rin terms of the fundamental constants of nature. Transitions to the ground state/parenleftbig nf=1/parenrightbig lie in the ultraviolet; they are known to spectroscopists as the Lyman series . Transitions to the ﬁrst excited state/parenleftbig nf=2/parenrightbig fall in the visible region; they constitute the Balmer series . Transitions to nf=3 (the Paschen series ) are in the infrared; and so on (see Figure 4.10). (At room temperature, most hydrogen atoms are in the ground state; to obtain the emission spectrum you must ﬁrst populate the various excited states; typically this is done by passing an electric spark through the gas.) ∗ Problem 4.19 Ahydrogenic atom consists of a single electron orbiting a nucleus with Z protons. ( Z=1 would be hydrogen itself, Z=2 is ionized helium, Z=3 is doubly ion- ized lithium, and so on.) Determine the Bohr energies En(Z), the binding energy E1(Z), the Bohr radius a(Z), and the Rydberg constant R(Z)for a hydrogenic atom. (Express 26By its nature, this involves a time- dependent potential, and the details will have to await Chapter 11; for our present purposes the actual mechanism involved is immaterial. 27The photon is a quantum of electromagnetic radiation; it’s a relativistic object if there ever was one, and therefore outside the scope of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. It will be useful in a few places to speak of photons, and to invoke the Planck formula for their energy, but please bear in mind that this is external to the theory we are developing.156 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions 0 −1.0 −2.0 −3.0 −4.0 −5.0 −6.0 −7.0 −8.0 −9.0 −10.0 −11.0 −12.0 −13.0 −14.0Energy (eV) Lyman seriesBalmer seriesPaschen series 23456 1n∞ Figure 4.10: Energy levels and transitions in the spectrum of hydrogen. your answers as appropriate multiples of the hydrogen values.)

The principal quantum number (n)determines the energy of the state (Equation 4.70);/lscriptandmare related to the orbital angular momentum. In the classical theory of central forces, energy and angular momentum are the fundamental conserved quantities, and it is not surprising that angular momentum plays an important) role in the quantum theory. Classically, the angular momentum of a particle (with respect to the origin) is given by the formula L=r×p, (4.95) which is to say,29 Lx=ypz−zpy,Ly=zpx−xpz,Lz=xpy−ypx. (4.96) The corresponding quantum operators30are obtained by the standard prescription px→ −i/planckover2pi1∂/∂x,py→− i/planckover2pi1∂/∂y,pz→− i/planckover2pi1∂/∂z. In this section we’ll obtain the eigenvalues of the the angular momentum operators by a purely algebraic technique reminiscent of the one we used in Chapter 2to get the allowed energies of the harmonic oscillator; it is all based on the clever exploitation of commutation relations. After that we will turn to the more difﬁcult problem of determining the eigenfunctions. 4.3.1 Eigenvalues The operators LxandLydo not commute; in fact /bracketleftbig Lx,Ly/bracketrightbig =/bracketleftbig ypz−zpy,zpx−xpz/bracketrightbig =/bracketleftbig ypz,zpx/bracketrightbig −/bracketleftbig ypz,xpz/bracketrightbig −/bracketleftbig zpy,zpx/bracketrightbig +/bracketleftbig zpy,xpz/bracketrightbig . (4.97) From the canonical commutation relations (Equation 4.10) we know that the only operators here that failto commute are xwith px,ywith py, and zwith pz. So the two middle terms drop out, leaving /bracketleftbig Lx,Ly/bracketrightbig =ypx/bracketleftbig pz,z/bracketrightbig +xpy/bracketleftbig z,pz/bracketrightbig =i/planckover2pi1/parenleftbig xpy−ypx/parenrightbig =i/planckover2pi1Lz. (4.98) Of course, we could have started out with/bracketleftbig Ly,Lz/bracketrightbig or/bracketleftbig Lz,Lx/bracketrightbig , but there is no need to calculate these separately—we can get them immediately by cyclic permutation of the indices (x→y, y→z,z→x): /bracketleftbig Lx,Ly/bracketrightbig =i/planckover2pi1Lz;/bracketleftbig Ly,Lz/bracketrightbig =i/planckover2pi1Lx;/bracketleftbig Lz,Lx/bracketrightbig =i/planckover2pi1Ly. (4.99) These are the fundamental commutation relations for angular momentum; everything follows from them. 29Because angular momentum involves the product of position and momentum, you might worry that the ambiguity addressed in Chapter 3(footnote 15,p a g e 102) would arise. Fortunately, only different components ofrandpare multiplied, and they commute (Equation 4.10). 30To reduce clutter (and avoid confusion with the unit vectors ˆı,ˆj,ˆk,ˆr,ˆθ,ˆφ) I’m going to take the hats off operators for the rest of the chapter.158 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions Notice that Lx,Ly, and Lzareincompatible observables. According to the generalized uncertainty principle (Equation 3.62), σ2 Lxσ2 Ly≥/parenleftbigg1 2i/angbracketlefti/planckover2pi1Lz/angbracketright/parenrightbigg2 =/planckover2pi12 4/angbracketleftLz/angbracketright2, or σLxσLy≥/planckover2pi1 2|/angbracketleftLz/angbracketright|. (4.100) It would therefore be futile to look for states that are simultaneously eigenfunctions of Lxand Ly. On the other hand, the square of the total angular momentum, L2≡L2 x+L2 y+L2 z, (4.101) does commute with Lx: /bracketleftBig L2,Lx/bracketrightBig =/bracketleftBig L2 x,Lx/bracketrightBig +/bracketleftBig L2 y,Lx/bracketrightBig +/bracketleftBig L2 z,Lx/bracketrightBig =Ly/bracketleftbig Ly,Lx/bracketrightbig +/bracketleftbig Ly,Lx/bracketrightbig Ly+Lz/bracketleftbig Lz,Lx/bracketrightbig +/bracketleftbig Lz,Lx/bracketrightbig Lz =Ly(−i/planckover2pi1Lz)+(−i/planckover2pi1Lz)Ly+Lz/parenleftbig i/planckover2pi1Ly/parenrightbig +/parenleftbig i/planckover2pi1Ly/parenrightbig Lz =0. (I used Equation 3.65 to reduce the commutators; of course, anyoperator commutes with itself .) It follows that L2also commutes with LyandLz: /bracketleftbig L2,Lx/bracketrightbig =0,/bracketleftbig L2,Ly/bracketrightbig =0,/bracketleftbig L2,Lz/bracketrightbig =0, (4.102) or, more compactly,/bracketleftbig L2,L/bracketrightbig =0. (4.103) SoL2iscompatible with each component of L, and we canhope to ﬁnd simultaneous eigenstates of L2and (say) Lz: L2f=λfand Lzf=μf. (4.104) We’ll use a ladder operator technique, very similar to the one we applied to the harmonic oscillator back in Section 2.3.1 .L e t L±≡Lx±iLy. (4.105) Its commutator with Lzis /bracketleftbig Lz,L±/bracketrightbig =/bracketleftbig Lz,Lx/bracketrightbig ±i/bracketleftbig Lz,Ly/bracketrightbig =i/planckover2pi1Ly±i(−i/planckover2pi1Lx)=±/planckover2pi1/parenleftbig Lx±iLy/parenrightbig , so/bracketleftbig Lz,L±/bracketrightbig =±/planckover2pi1L±. (4.106) Also (from Equation 4.102 )/bracketleftbig L2,L±/bracketrightbig =0. (4.107) I claim that if fis an eigenfunction of L2andLz,s oa l s oi s L±f: Equation 4.107 says L2(L±f)=L±/parenleftbig L2f/parenrightbig =L±(λf)=λ(L±f), (4.108) soL±fis an eigenfunction of L2, with the same eigenvalue λ, and Equation 4.106 says Lz(L±f)=(LzL±−L±Lz)f+L±Lzf=±/planckover2pi1L±f+L±(μf) =(μ±/planckover2pi1)(L±f), (4.109)4.3 Angular Momentum 159 μμ + 3 μ + 2 μ −μ + μ − 2 μ − 3 fbL_L_ fL+fL+ L3_fL2_fL2+fL3+f fft h h h h hh h h Figure 4.11: The “ladder” of angular momentum states. soL±fis an eigenfunction of Lzwith the new eigenvalueμ±/planckover2pi1. We call L+theraising operator , because it increases the eigenvalue of Lzby/planckover2pi1, and L−thelowering operator , because it lowers the eigenvalue by /planckover2pi1. For a given value of λ, then, we obtain a “ladder” of states, with each “rung” separated from its neighbors by one unit of /planckover2pi1in the eigenvalue of Lz(see Figure 4.11). To ascend the ladder we apply the raising operator, and to descend, the lowering operator. But this process cannot go on forever: Eventually we’re going to reach a state for which the z-component exceeds the total, and that cannot be.31There must exist a “top rung”, ft, such that32 L+ft=0. (4.110) Let/planckover2pi1/lscriptbe the eigenvalue of Lzat the top rung (the appropriateness of the letter “ /lscript” will appear in a moment): Lzft=/planckover2pi1/lscriptft;L2ft=λft.

Problem 4.21 explores this alternative.160 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions Now, L±L∓=/parenleftbig Lx±iLy/parenrightbig/parenleftbig Lx∓iLy/parenrightbig =L2 x+L2 y∓i/parenleftbig LxLy−LyLx/parenrightbig =L2−L2 z∓i(i/planckover2pi1Lz), or, putting it the other way around, L2=L±L∓+L2 z∓/planckover2pi1Lz. (4.112) It follows that L2ft=/parenleftBig L−L++L2 z+/planckover2pi1Lz/parenrightBig ft=/parenleftBig 0+/planckover2pi12/lscript2+/planckover2pi12/lscript/parenrightBig ft=/planckover2pi12/lscript(/lscript+1)ft, and hence λ=/planckover2pi12/lscript(/lscript+1). (4.113) This tells us the eigenvalue of L2in terms of the maximum eigenvalue of Lz. Meanwhile, there is also (for the same reason) a bottom rung, fb, such that L−fb=0. (4.114) Let/planckover2pi1¯/lscriptbe the eigenvalue of Lzat this bottom rung: Lzfb=/planckover2pi1¯/lscriptfb;L2fb=λfb. (4.115) Using Equation 4.112 ,w eh a v e L2fb=/parenleftBig L+L−+L2 z−/planckover2pi1Lz/parenrightBig fb=/parenleftBig 0+/planckover2pi12¯/lscript2−/planckover2pi12¯/lscript/parenrightBig fb=/planckover2pi12¯/lscript(¯/lscript−1)fb, and therefore λ=/planckover2pi12¯/lscript/parenleftbig¯/lscript−1/parenrightbig . (4.116) Comparing Equations 4.113 and4.116 , we see that/lscript(/lscript+1)=¯/lscript/parenleftbig¯/lscript−1/parenrightbig , so either¯/lscript=/lscript+1 (which is absurd—the bottom rung would be higher than the top rung!) or else ¯/lscript=−/lscript. (4.117) So the eigenvalues of Lzarem/planckover2pi1, where m(the appropriateness of this letter will also be clear in a moment) goes from −/lscriptto+/lscript,i nNinteger steps. In particular, it follows that /lscript= −/lscript+N, and hence/lscript=N/2, so/lscriptmust be an integer or a half-integer . The eigenfunctions are characterized by the numbers /lscriptandm: L2fm /lscript=/planckover2pi12/lscript(/lscript+1)fm /lscript;Lzfm /lscript=/planckover2pi1mfm /lscript, (4.118) where /lscript=0,1/2,1,3/2,...;m=−/lscript,−/lscript+1,...,/lscript−1,/lscript . (4.119) For a given value of /lscript, there are 2/lscript+1 different values of m(i.e. 2/lscript+1 “rungs” on the “ladder”). Some people like to illustrate this with the diagram in Figure 4.12 (drawn for the case /lscript=2). The arrows are supposed to represent possible angular momenta (in units of /planckover2pi1)—they all have the same length√/lscript(/lscript+1)(in this case√ 6=2.45), and their zcomponents are the allowed values of m(−2,−1,0,1,2). Notice that the magnitude of the vectors (the radius of the sphere) is greater than the maximum zcomponent! (In general,√/lscript(/lscript+1)>/lscript, except for the “trivial” case /lscript=0.) Evidently you can’t get the angular momentum to point perfectly4.3 Angular Momentum 161 2 1 −2−10 LxLz LyL Figure 4.12: Angular momentum states (for /lscript=2). along the zdirection. At ﬁrst, this sounds absurd. “Why can’t I just pick my axes so that z points along the direction of the angular momentum vector?” Well, to do that you would have to know all three components simultaneously, and the uncertainty principle (Equation 4.100 ) says that’s impossible. “Well, all right, but surely once in a while, by good fortune, I will just happen to aim my zaxis along the direction of L.” No, no! You have missed the point. It’s not merely that you don’t know all three components of L; there just aren’t three components—a particle simply cannot have a determinate angular momentum vector, any more than it can simultaneously have a determinate position and momentum. If Lzhas a well-deﬁned value, then LxandLydonot. It is misleading even to draw the vectors in Figure 4.12—at best they should be smeared out around the latitude lines, to indicate that LxandLyare indeterminate. I hope you’re impressed: By purely algebraic means , starting with the fundamental commu- tation relations for angular momentum (Equation 4.99), we have determined the eigenvalues of L2andLz—without ever seeing the eigenfunctions themselves! We turn now to the problem of constructing the eigenfunctions, but I should warn you that this is a much messier business. Just so you know where we’re headed, I’ll let you in on the punch line: fm /lscript=Ym /lscript—the eigen- functions of L2andLzare nothing but the old spherical harmonics, which we came upon by a quite different route in Section 4.1.2 (that’s why I chose the same letters /lscriptandm, of course). And I can now explain why the spherical harmonics are orthogonal: They are eigenfunctions of hermitian operators/parenleftbig L2andLz)belonging to distinct eigenvalues (Theorem 2, Section 3.3.1 ). ∗ Problem 4.21 The raising and lowering operators change the value of mby one unit: L+fm /lscript=/parenleftbig Am /lscript/parenrightbig fm+1 /lscript,L−fm /lscript=/parenleftbig Bm /lscript/parenrightbig fm−1 /lscript(4.120) where Am /lscriptandBm /lscriptare constants. Question : What arethey, if the eigenfunctions are to be normalized? Hint: First show that L∓is the hermitian conjugate of L±(since LxandLy a r e o b s e r v a b l e s , y o u m a y a s s u m e t h e y a r e h e r m i t i a n ...b u t prove it if you like); then use Equation 4.112 .Answer :162 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions Am /lscript=/planckover2pi1/radicalbig /lscript(/lscript+1)−m(m+1)=/planckover2pi1/radicalbig (/lscript−m)(/lscript+m+1), Bm /lscript=/planckover2pi1/radicalbig /lscript(/lscript+1)−m(m−1)=/planckover2pi1/radicalbig (/lscript+m)(/lscript−m+1). (4.121) Note what happens at the top and bottom of the ladder (i.e. when you apply L+tof/lscript /lscriptor L−tof−/lscript /lscript). ∗ Problem 4.22 (a)Starting with the canonical commutation relations for position and momentum (Equation 4.10), work out the following commutators: /bracketleftbig Lz,x/bracketrightbig =i/planckover2pi1y,/bracketleftbig Lz,y/bracketrightbig =−i/planckover2pi1x,/bracketleftbig Lz,z/bracketrightbig =0/bracketleftbig Lz,px/bracketrightbig =i/planckover2pi1py,/bracketleftbig Lz,py/bracketrightbig =−i/planckover2pi1px,/bracketleftbig Lz,pz/bracketrightbig =0.(4.122) (b)Use these results to obtain/bracketleftbig Lz,Lx/bracketrightbig =i/planckover2pi1Lydirectly from Equation 4.96. (c)Find the commutators/bracketleftbig Lz,r2/bracketrightbig and/bracketleftbig Lz,p2/bracketrightbig (where, of course, r2=x2+y2+z2 andp2=p2 x+p2 y+p2 z). (d)Show that the Hamiltonian H=/parenleftbig p2/2m/parenrightbig +Vcommutes with all three compo- nents of L, provided that Vdepends only on r. (Thus H,L2, and Lzare mutually compatible observables.) ∗∗ Problem 4.23 (a)Prove that for a particle in a potential V(r)the rate of change of the expectation value of the orbital angular momentum Lis equal to the expectation value of the torque: d dt/angbracketleftL/angbracketright=/angbracketleftN/angbracketright, where N=r×(−∇V). (This is the rotational analog to Ehrenfest’s theorem.) (b)Show that d/angbracketleftL/angbracketright/dt=0 for any spherically symmetric potential. (This is one form of the quantum statement of conservation of angular momentum .) 4.3.2 Eigenfunctions First of all we need to rewrite Lx,Ly, and Lzin spherical coordinates. Now, L=−i/planckover2pi1(r×∇), and the gradient, in spherical coordinates, is:33 ∇=ˆr∂ ∂r+ˆθ1 r∂ ∂θ+ˆφ1 rsinθ∂ ∂φ; (4.123) 33George Arfken and Hans-Jurgen Weber, Mathematical Methods for Physicists , 7th edn, Academic Press, Orlando (2013), Section 3.10.4.3 Angular Momentum 163 meanwhile, r=rˆr,s o L=−i/planckover2pi1/bracketleftbigg r/parenleftBig ˆr×ˆr/parenrightBig∂ ∂r+/parenleftBig ˆr×ˆθ/parenrightBig∂ ∂θ+/parenleftBig ˆr×ˆφ/parenrightBig1 sinθ∂ ∂φ/bracketrightbigg . But/parenleftBig ˆr×ˆr/parenrightBig =0,/parenleftBig ˆr×ˆθ/parenrightBig =ˆφ, and/parenleftBig ˆr×ˆφ/parenrightBig =−ˆθ(see Figure 4.1), and hence L=−i/planckover2pi1/parenleftbigg ˆφ∂ ∂θ−ˆθ1 sinθ∂ ∂φ/parenrightbigg . (4.124) The unit vectors ˆθandˆφcan be resolved into their cartesian components: ˆθ=(cosθcosφ)ˆı+(cosθsinφ)ˆj−(sinθ)ˆk; (4.125) ˆφ=−(sinφ)ˆı+(cosφ)ˆj. (4.126) Thus L=−i/planckover2pi1/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbig −sinφˆı+cosφˆj/parenrightbig∂ ∂θ −/parenleftBig cosθcosφˆı+cosθsinφˆj−sinθˆk/parenrightBig1 sinθ∂ ∂φ/bracketrightbigg . So Lx=−i/planckover2pi1/parenleftbigg −sinφ∂ ∂θ−cosφcotθ∂ ∂φ/parenrightbigg , (4.127) Ly=−i/planckover2pi1/parenleftbigg +cosφ∂ ∂θ−sinφcotθ∂ ∂φ/parenrightbigg , (4.128) and Lz=−i/planckover2pi1∂ ∂φ. (4.129) We shall also need the raising and lowering operators: L±=Lx±iLy=−i/planckover2pi1/bracketleftbigg (−sinφ±icosφ)∂ ∂θ−(cosφ±isinφ)cotθ∂ ∂φ/bracketrightbigg . But cosφ±isinφ=e±iφ,s o L±=±/planckover2pi1e±iφ/parenleftbigg∂ ∂θ±icotθ∂ ∂φ/parenrightbigg . (4.130) In particular (Problem 4.24(a)): L+L−=−/planckover2pi12/parenleftbigg∂2 ∂θ2+cotθ∂ ∂θ+cot2θ∂2 ∂φ2+i∂ ∂φ/parenrightbigg , (4.131) and hence (Problem 4.24(b)): L2=−/planckover2pi12/bracketleftbigg1 sinθ∂ ∂θ/parenleftbigg sinθ∂ ∂θ/parenrightbigg +1 sin2θ∂2 ∂φ2/bracketrightbigg . (4.132) We are now in a position to determine fm /lscript(θ,φ). It’s an eigenfunction of L2, with eigenvalue /planckover2pi12/lscript(/lscript+1):164 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions L2fm /lscript=−/planckover2pi12/bracketleftbigg1 sinθ∂ ∂θ/parenleftbigg sinθ∂ ∂θ/parenrightbigg +1 sin2θ∂2 ∂φ2/bracketrightbigg fm /lscript=/planckover2pi12/lscript(/lscript+1)fm /lscript. But this is precisely the “angular equation” (Equation 4.18). And it’s also an eigenfunction of Lz, with the eigenvalue m/planckover2pi1: Lzfm /lscript=−i/planckover2pi1∂ ∂φfm /lscript=/planckover2pi1mfm /lscript, but this is equivalent to the azimuthal equation (Equation 4.21). We have already solved this system of equations! The result (appropriately normalized) is the spherical harmonic, Ym /lscript(θ,φ).Conclusion: Spherical harmonics arethe eigenfunctions of L2andLz. When we solved the Schrödinger equation by separation of variables, in Section 4.1, we were inad- vertently constructing simultaneous eigenfunctions of the three commuting operators H,L2, andLz: Hψ=Eψ, L2ψ=/planckover2pi12/lscript(/lscript+1)ψ, Lzψ=/planckover2pi1mψ. (4.133) Incidentally, we can use Equation 4.132 to rewrite the Schrödinger equation (Equation 4.14) more compactly: 1 2mr2/bracketleftbigg −/planckover2pi12∂ ∂r/parenleftbigg r2∂ ∂r/parenrightbigg +L2/bracketrightbigg ψ+Vψ=Eψ. There is a curious ﬁnal twist to this story: the algebraic theory of angular momentum per- mits/lscript(and hence also m)t ot a k eo n half-integer values (Equation 4.119 ), whereas separation of variables yielded eigenfunctions only for integer values (Equation 4.29).34You might sup- pose that the half-integer solutions are spurious, but it turns out that they are of profound importance, as we shall see in the following sections. ∗ Problem 4.24 (a)Derive Equation 4.131 from Equation 4.130 .Hint: Use a test function; otherwise you’re likely to drop some terms.

Loewenstein, Journal of the Optical Society of America ,50, 1163 (1960). 4.4 SPIN Inclassical mechanics, a rigid object admits two kinds of angular momentum: orbital (L= r×p), associated with motion ofthe center of mass, and spin (S=Iω), associated with motion about the center of mass. For example, the earth has orbital angular momentum attributable to its annual revolution around the sun, and spin angular momentum coming from its daily rotation about the north–south axis. In the classical context this distinction is largely a matter of convenience, for when you come right down to it, Sis nothing but the sum total of the166 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions “orbital” angular momenta of all the rocks and dirt clods that go to make up the earth, as they circle around the axis. But a similar thing happens in quantum mechanics, and here the distinction is absolutely fundamental. In addition to orbital angular momentum, associated (in the case of hydrogen) with the motion of the electron around the nucleus (and described by the spherical harmonics), the electron also carries another form of angular momentum, which has nothing to do with motion in space (and which is not, therefore, described by any function of the position variables r,θ,φ ) but which is somewhat analogous to classical spin (and for which, therefore, we use the same word). It doesn’t pay to press this analogy too far: The electron (as far as we know) is a structureless point, and its spin angular momentum cannot be decomposed into orbital angular momenta of constituent parts (see Problem 4.28).35Sufﬁce it to say that elementary particles carry intrinsic angular momentum ( S) in addition to their “extrinsic” angular momentum (L). Thealgebraic theory of spin is a carbon copy of the theory of orbital angular momentum, beginning with the fundamental commutation relations:36 /bracketleftbig Sx,Sy/bracketrightbig =i/planckover2pi1Sz,/bracketleftbig Sy,Sz/bracketrightbig =i/planckover2pi1Sx,/bracketleftbig Sz,Sx/bracketrightbig =i/planckover2pi1Sy. (4.134) It follows (as before) that the eigenvectors of S2andSzsatisfy37 S2|sm/angbracketrightbig =/planckover2pi12s(s+1)|sm/angbracketrightbig ;Sz|sm/angbracketrightbig =/planckover2pi1m|sm/angbracketrightbig ; (4.135) and S±|sm/angbracketright=/planckover2pi1/radicalbig s(s+1)−m(m±1)|s(m±1)/angbracketright, (4.136) where S±≡Sx±iSy. But this time the eigenvectors are not spherical harmonics (they’re not functions ofθandφat all), and there is no reason to exclude the half-integer values of sand m: s=0,1 2,1,3 2,...;m=−s,−s+1,..., s−1,s. (4.137) It so happens that every elementary particle has a speciﬁc and immutable value of s, which we call the spin of that particular species: πmesons have spin 0; electrons have spin 1/2; photons have spin 1; /Delta1baryons have spin 3/2; gravitons have spin 2; and so on. By contrast, theorbital angular momentum quantum number l(for an electron in a hydrogen atom, say) can take on any (integer) value you please, and will change from one to another when the system is perturbed. But sisﬁxed, for any given particle, and this makes the theory of spin comparatively simple.38 35For a contrary interpretation, see Hans C. Ohanian, “What is Spin?”, A m .J .P h y s . 54, 500 (1986). 36We shall take these as postulates for the theory of spin; the analogous formulas for orbital angular momentum (Equation 4.99)w e r e derived from the known form of the operators (Equation 4.96). Actually, they both follow from rotational invariance in three dimensions, as we shall see in Chapter 6. Indeed, these fundamental commuta- tion relations apply to allforms of angular momentum, whether spin, orbital, or the combined angular momentum of a composite system, which could be partly spin and partly orbital. 37Because the eigenstates of spin are not functions , I will switch now to Dirac notation. By the way, I’m running out of letters, so I’ll use mfor the eigenvalue of Sz, just as I did for Lz(some authors write mlandmsat this stage, just to be absolutely clear). 38Indeed, in a mathematical sense, spin 1/2 is the simplest possible nontrivial quantum system, for it admits just two basis states (recall Example 3.8). In place of an inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space, with all its subtleties and complications, we ﬁnd ourselves working in an ordinary two-dimensional vector space; instead of unfamiliar differential equations and fancy functions, we are confronted with 2 ×2 matrices and two-component vectors. For this reason, some authors begin quantum mechanics with the study of spin. (An outstanding example is John4.4 Spin 167 Problem 4.28 If the electron were a classical solid sphere, with radius rc=e2 4π/epsilon10mc2, (4.138) (the so-called classical electron radius , obtained by assuming the electron’s mass is attributable to energy stored in its electric ﬁeld, via the Einstein formula E=mc2), and its angular momentum is (1/2)/planckover2pi1, then how fast (in m/s) would a point on the “equator” be moving? Does this model make sense? (Actually, the radius of the electron is known experimentally to be much less than rc, but this only makes matters worse.)39 4.4.1 Spin 1/2 By far the most important case is s=1/2, for this is the spin of the particles that make up ordinary matter (protons, neutrons, and electrons), as well as all quarks and all leptons. Moreover, once you understand spin 1/2, it is a simple matter to work out the formalism for any higher spin. There are just twoeigenstates:/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1 21 2/angbracketrightBig , which we call spin up (informally,↑), and/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1 2/parenleftBig −1 2/parenrightBig/angbracketrightBig ,spin down(↓). Using these as basis vectors, the general state40of a spin-1/2 particle can be represented by a two-element column matrix (or spinor ): χ=/parenleftbigga b/parenrightbigg =aχ++bχ−, (4.139) with χ+=/parenleftbigg1 0/parenrightbigg (4.140) representing spin up, and χ−=/parenleftbigg0 1/parenrightbigg (4.141) for spin down. With respect to this basis the spin operators become 2 ×2 matrices,41w h i c hw ec a nw o r k out by noting their effect on χ+andχ−. Equation 4.135 says S. Townsend, A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics, 2nd edn, University Books, Sausalito, CA, 2012.) But the price of mathematical simplicity is conceptual abstraction, and I prefer not to do it that way. 39If it comforts you to picture the electron as a tiny spinning sphere, go ahead; I do, and I don’t think it hurts, as long as you don’t take it literally. 40I’m only talking about the spin state, for the moment. If the particle is moving around, we will also need to deal with its position state(/Psi1), but for the moment let’s put that aside. 41I hate to be fussy about notation, but perhaps I should reiterate that a ket (such as |sm/angbracketright)i sa vector in Hilbert space (in this case a (2s+1)-dimensional vector space), whereas a spinor χis a set of components of a vector, with respect to a particular basis/parenleftBig/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1 21 2/angbracketrightBig and/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1 2−1 2/angbracketrightBig , in the case of spin1 2/parenrightBig , displayed as a column. Physicists sometimes write, for instance,/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1 21 2/angbracketrightBig =χ+, but technically this confuses a vector (which lives “out there” in Hilbert space) with its components (a string of numbers). Similarly, Sz(for example) is an operator that acts on kets; it is represented (with respect to the chosen basis) by a matrix Sz(sans serif), which multiplies spinors—but again, Sz=Sz, though perfectly intelligible, is sloppy language.168 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions S2χ+=3 4/planckover2pi12χ+and S2χ−=3 4/planckover2pi12χ−. (4.142) If we write S2as a matrix with (as yet) undetermined elements, S2=/parenleftbiggcd ef/parenrightbigg , then the ﬁrst equation says /parenleftbiggcd ef/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg1 0/parenrightbigg =3 4/planckover2pi12/parenleftbigg1 0/parenrightbigg ,or/parenleftbiggc e/parenrightbigg =/parenleftbigg3 4/planckover2pi12 0/parenrightbigg , soc=(3/4)/planckover2pi12ande=0. The second equation says /parenleftbiggcd ef/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg0 1/parenrightbigg =3 4/planckover2pi12/parenleftbigg0 1/parenrightbigg ,or/parenleftbiggd f/parenrightbigg =/parenleftbigg0 3 4/planckover2pi12/parenrightbigg , sod=0 and f=(3/4)/planckover2pi12.Conclusion: S2=3 4/planckover2pi12/parenleftbigg10 01/parenrightbigg . (4.143) Similarly, Szχ+=/planckover2pi1 2χ+, Szχ−=−/planckover2pi1 2χ−, (4.144) from which it follows that Sz=/planckover2pi1 2/parenleftbigg10 0−1/parenrightbigg . (4.145) Meanwhile, Equation 4.136 says S+χ−=/planckover2pi1χ+,S−χ+=/planckover2pi1χ−,S+χ+=S−χ−=0, so S+=/planckover2pi1/parenleftbigg01 00/parenrightbigg ,S−=/planckover2pi1/parenleftbigg00 10/parenrightbigg . (4.146) Now S±=Sx±iSy,s oSx=(1/2)(S++S−)andSy=(1/2i)(S+−S−), and hence Sx=/planckover2pi1 2/parenleftbigg01 10/parenrightbigg ,Sy=/planckover2pi1 2/parenleftbigg0−i i0/parenrightbigg . (4.147) Since Sx,Sy, and Szall carry a factor of /planckover2pi1/2, it is tidier to write S=(/planckover2pi1/2)σ, where σx≡/parenleftbigg01 10/parenrightbigg ,σy≡/parenleftbigg0−i i0/parenrightbigg ,σz≡/parenleftbigg10 0−1/parenrightbigg . (4.148) These are the famous Pauli spin matrices . Notice that Sx,Sy,Sz, and S2are all hermitian matrices (as they should be, since they represent observables). On the other hand, S+and S− arenothermitian—evidently they are not observable.4.4 Spin 169 The eigenspinors of Szare (or course): χ+=/parenleftbigg1 0/parenrightbigg ,/parenleftbigg eigenvalue+/planckover2pi1 2/parenrightbigg ;χ−=/parenleftbigg0 1/parenrightbigg ,/parenleftbigg eigenvalue−/planckover2pi1 2/parenrightbigg . (4.149) If you measure Szon a particle in the general state χ(Equation 4.139 ), you could get +/planckover2pi1/2, with probability |a|2,o r−/planckover2pi1/2, with probability |b|2. Since these are the only possibilities, |a|2+|b|2=1 (4.150) (i.e. the spinor must be normalized :χ†χ=1).42 But what if, instead, you chose to measure Sx? What are the possible results, and what are their respective probabilities? According to the generalized statistical interpretation, we need to know the eigenvalues and eigenspinors of Sx. The characteristic equation is /vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle−λ/planckover2pi1/2 /planckover2pi1/2−λ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=0⇒λ2=/parenleftbigg/planckover2pi1 2/parenrightbigg2 ⇒λ=±/planckover2pi1 Not surprisingly (but it gratifying to see how it works out), the possible values for Sxare the same as those for Sz. The eigenspinors are obtained in the usual way: /planckover2pi1 2/parenleftbigg01 10/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggα β/parenrightbigg =±/planckover2pi1 2/parenleftbiggα β/parenrightbigg ⇒/parenleftbiggβ α/parenrightbigg =±/parenleftbiggα β/parenrightbigg , soβ=±α. Evidently the (normalized) eigenspinors of Sxare χ(x) +=/parenleftbigg1/√ 2 1/√ 2/parenrightbigg ,/parenleftbigg eigenvalue+/planckover2pi1 2/parenrightbigg ;χ(x) −=/parenleftbigg1/√ 2 −1/√ 2/parenrightbigg ,/parenleftbigg eigenvalue−/planckover2pi1 2/parenrightbigg .(4.151) As the eigenvectors of a hermitian matrix, they span the space; the generic spinor χ(Equation 4.139 ) can be expressed as a linear combination of them: χ=/parenleftbigga+b√ 2/parenrightbigg χ(x) ++/parenleftbigga−b√ 2/parenrightbigg χ(x) −. (4.152) If you measure Sx, the probability of getting +/planckover2pi1/2i s(1/2)|a+b|2, and the probabil- ity of getting −/planckover2pi1/2i s(1/2)|a−b|2. (Check for yourself that these probabilities add up to 1.) Example 4.2 Suppose a spin-1/2 particle is in the state χ=1√ 6/parenleftbigg1+i 2/parenrightbigg . What are the probabilities of getting +/planckover2pi1/2 and−/planckover2pi1/2, if you measure SzandSx? Solution: Here a=(1+i)/√ 6 and b=2/√ 6, so for Szthe probability of getting +/planckover2pi1/2 is/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(1+i)/√ 6/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2=1/3, and the probability of getting −/planckover2pi1/2i s/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2/√ 6/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2=2/3. For 42People often say that |a|2is the “probability that the particle is in the spin-up state,” but this is bad language; what they mean is that if you measured S z,|a|2is the probability you’d get /planckover2pi1/2. See footnote 18,p a g e 103.170 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions Sxthe probability of getting +/planckover2pi1/2i s(1/2)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(3+i)/√ 6/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2=5/6, and the probability of getting−/planckover2pi1/2i s(1/2)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(−1+i)/√ 6/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2=1/6.

Let’s say we start out with a particle in the state χ+. If someone asks, “What is the z-component of that particle’s spin angular momentum?”, we can answer unambigu- ously:+/planckover2pi1/2. For a measurement of Szis certain to return that value. But if our interrogator asks instead, “What is the x-component of that particle’s spin angular momentum?” we are obliged to equivocate: If you measure Sx, the chances are ﬁfty-ﬁfty of getting either /planckover2pi1/2o r −/planckover2pi1/2. If the questioner is a classical physicist, or a “realist” (in the sense of Section 1.2), he will regard this as an inadequate—not to say impertinent—response: “Are you telling me that you don’t know the true state of that particle?” On the contrary; I know precisely what the state of the particle is: χ+. “Well, then, how come you can’t tell me what the x- component of its spin is?” Because it simply does not have a particular x-component of spin. Indeed, it cannot , for if both SxandSzwere well-deﬁned, the uncertainty principle would be violated. At this point our challenger grabs the test-tube and measures thex-component of the particle’s spin; let’s say he gets the value +/planckover2pi1/2. “Aha!” (he shouts in triumph), “You lied! This particle has a perfectly well-deﬁned value of Sx:/planckover2pi1/2.” Well, sure—it does now,b u t that doesn’t prove it hadthat value, prior to your measurement. “You have obviously been reduced to splitting hairs. And anyway, what happened to your uncertainty principle? I now know both Sxand S z.” I’m sorry, but you do not: In the course of your measurement, you altered the particle’s state; it is now in the state χ(x) +, and whereas you know the value ofSx, you no longer know the value of Sz. “But I was extremely careful not to disturb the particle when I measured Sx.” Very well, if you don’t believe me, check it out : Mea- sure Sz, and see what you get. (Of course, he may get+/planckover2pi1/2, which will be embarrassing to my case—but if we repeat this whole scenario over and over, half the time he will get −/planckover2pi1/2.) To the layman, the philosopher, or the classical physicist, a statement of the form “this particle doesn’t have a well-deﬁned position” (or momentum, or x-component of spin angular momentum, or whatever) sounds vague, incompetent, or (worst of all) profound. It is none of these. But its precise meaning is, I think, almost impossible to convey to anyone who has not studied quantum mechanics in some depth. If you ﬁnd your own comprehension slipping, from time to time (if you don’t , you probably haven’t understood the problem), come back to the spin-1/2 system: It is the simplest and cleanest context for thinking through the conceptual paradoxes of quantum mechanics.4.4 Spin 171 Problem 4.29 (a)Check that the spin matrices (Equations 4.145 and4.147 ) obey the fundamental commutation relations for angular momentum, Equation 4.134 .

Its magnetic dipole moment ,μ,i s proportional to its spin angular momentum, S: μ=γS; (4.156) the proportionality constant, γ, is called the gyromagnetic ratio .43When a magnetic dipole is placed in a magnetic ﬁeld B, it experiences a torque, μ×B, which tends to line it up parallel to the ﬁeld (just like a compass needle). The energy associated with this torque is44 H=−μ·B, (4.157) so the Hamiltonian matrix for a spinning charged particle, at rest45in a magnetic ﬁeld B,i s H=−γB·S, (4.158) where Sis the appropriate spin matrix (Equations 4.145 and4.147 , in the case of spin 1/2). Example 4.3 Larmor precession: Imagine a particle of spin 1/2 at rest in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, which points in the z-direction: B=B0ˆk. (4.159) The Hamiltonian (Equation 4.158 )i s H=−γB0Sz=−γB0/planckover2pi1 2/parenleftbigg10 0−1/parenrightbigg . (4.160) The eigenstates of Hare the same as those of Sz: /braceleftBigg χ+,with energy E+=−(γB0/planckover2pi1)/2, χ−,with energy E−=+(γB0/planckover2pi1)/2.(4.161) 43See, for example, David J. Grifﬁths, Introduction to Electrodynamics , 4th edn (Pearson, Boston, 2013), Problem 5.58. Classically, the gyromagnetic ratio of an object whose charge and mass are identically distributed is q/2m, where qis the charge and mis the mass. For reasons that are fully explained only in relativistic quantum theory, the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron is (almost) exactly twice the classical value: γ=−e/m. 44Grifﬁths (footnote 43), Problem 6.21. 45If the particle is allowed to move , there will also be kinetic energy to consider; moreover, it will be subject to the Lorentz force (qv×B), which is not derivable from a potential energy function, and hence does not ﬁt the Schrödinger equation as we have formulated it so far. I’ll show you later on how to handle this (Problem 4.42), but for the moment let’s just assume that the particle is free to rotate , but otherwise stationary.4.4 Spin 173 The energy is lowest when the dipole moment is parallel to the ﬁeld—just as it would be classically. Since the Hamiltonian is time independent, the general solution to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, i/planckover2pi1∂χ ∂t=Hχ, (4.162) can be expressed in terms of the stationary states: χ(t)=aχ+e−iE+t//planckover2pi1+bχ−e−iE−t//planckover2pi1=/parenleftbiggaeiγB0t/2 be−iγB0t/2/parenrightbigg . The constants aandbare determined by the initial conditions: χ(0)=/parenleftbigga b/parenrightbigg , (of course,|a|2+|b|2=1). With no essential loss of generality46I’ll write a=cos(α/2) andb=sin(α/2), whereαis a ﬁxed angle whose physical signiﬁcance will appear in a moment. Thus χ(t)=/parenleftbiggcos(α/2)eiγB0t/2 sin(α/2)e−iγB0t/2/parenrightbigg . (4.163) To get a feel for what is happening here, let’s calculate the expectation value of S,a sa function of time: /angbracketleftSx/angbracketright=χ(t)†Sxχ(t) =/parenleftbig cos(α/2)e−iγB0t/2sin(α/2)eiγB0t/2/parenrightbig/planckover2pi1 2/parenleftbigg01 10/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggcos(α/2)eiγB0t/2 sin(α/2)e−iγB0t/2/parenrightbigg =/planckover2pi1 2sinαcos(γB0t). (4.164) Similarly, /angbracketleftbig Sy/angbracketrightbig =χ(t)†Syχ(t)=−/planckover2pi1 2sinαsin(γB0t), (4.165) and /angbracketleftSz/angbracketright=χ(t)†Szχ(t)=/planckover2pi1 2cosα. (4.166) Thus/angbracketleftS/angbracketrightis tilted at a constant angle αto the zaxis, and precesses about the ﬁeld at the Larmor frequency ω=γB0, (4.167) 46This does assume that aandbarereal; you can work out the general case if you like, but all it does is add a constant to t.174 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions αω 〈S〈z y x Figure 4.14: Precession of/angbracketleftS/angbracketrightin a uniform magnetic ﬁeld. just as it would classically47(see Figure 4.14). No surprise here—Ehrenfest’s theorem (in the form derived in Problem 4.23) guarantees that /angbracketleftS/angbracketrightevolves according to the classical laws. But it’s nice to see how this works out in a speciﬁc context. Example 4.4 The Stern–Gerlach experiment: In an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, there is not only a torque , but also a force , on a magnetic dipole:48 F=∇(μ·B). (4.168) This force can be used to separate out particles with a particular spin orientation. Imagine a beam of heavy neutral atoms,49traveling in the ydirection, which passes through a region of static but inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld (Figure 4.15)—say B(x,y,z)=−αxˆı+(B0+αz)ˆk, (4.169) 47See, for instance, Richard P. Feynman and Robert B. Leighton, The Feynman Lectures on Physics (Addison-Wesley, Reading, 1964), V olume II, Section 34-3. Of course, in the classical case it is the angular momentum vector itself, not just its expectation value, that precesses around the magnetic ﬁeld. 48Grifﬁths (footnote 43), Section 6.1.2. Note that Fis the negative gradient of the energy (Equation 4.157 ). 49We make them neutral so as to avoid the large-scale deﬂection that would otherwise result from the Lorentz force, and heavy so we can construct localized wave packets and treat the motion in terms of classical particle trajectories. In practice, the Stern–Gerlach experiment doesn’t work, for example, with a beam of free electrons. Stern and Gerlach themselves used silver atoms; for the story of their discovery see B. Friedrich and D. Herschbach, Physics Today 56, 53 (2003).4.4 Spin 175 Spin up Spin down Magnetz xy Figure 4.15: The Stern–Gerlach apparatus. where B0is a strong uniform ﬁeld and the constant αdescribes a small deviation from homogeneity. (Actually, what we’d prefer is just the zcomponent of this ﬁeld, but unfortunately that’s impossible—it would violate the electromagnetic law ∇·B=0; like it or not, the xcomponent comes along for the ride.) The force on these atoms is50 F=γα/parenleftBig −Sxˆı+Szˆk/parenrightBig . But because of the Larmor precession about B0,Sxoscillates rapidly, and averages to zero; the netf o r c ei si nt h e zdirection: Fz=γαSz, (4.170) and the beam is deﬂected up or down, in proportion to the zcomponent of the spin angular momentum. Classically we’d expect a smear (because Szwould not be quantized), but in fact the beam splits into 2 s+1 separate streams, beautifully demonstrating the quantization of angular momentum. (If you use silver atoms, all the inner electrons are paired, in such a way that their angular momenta cancel. The net spin is simply that of the outermost— unpaired—electron, so in this case s=1/2, and the beam splits in two.) The Stern–Gerlach experiment has played an important role in the philosophy of quan- tum mechanics, where it serves both as the prototype for the preparation of a quantum state and as an illuminating model for a certain kind of quantum measurement. We tend casually to assume that the initial state of a system is known (the Schrödinger equation tells us how it subsequently evolves)—but it is natural to wonder how you get a system into a particular state in the ﬁrst place. Well, if you want to prepare a beam of atoms in a given spin con- ﬁguration, you pass an unpolarized beam through a Stern–Gerlach magnet, and select the outgoing stream you are interested in (closing off the others with suitable bafﬂes and shut- ters). Conversely, if you want to measure thezcomponent of an atom’s spin, you send it through a Stern–Gerlach apparatus, and record which bin it lands in. I do not claim that this is always the most practical way to do the job, but it is conceptually very clean, and hence a useful context in which to explore the problems of state preparation and measurement. Problem 4.35 In Example 4.3: (a)If you measured the component of spin angular momentum along the xdirection, at time t, what is the probability that you would get +/planckover2pi1/2? (b)Same question, but for the ycomponent. (c)Same, for the zcomponent. 50For a quantum mechanical justiﬁcation of this equation see Problem 4.73.176 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions ∗∗ Problem 4.36 An electron is at rest in an oscillating magnetic ﬁeld B=B0cos(ωt)ˆk, where B0andωare constants. (a)Construct the Hamiltonian matrix for this system. (b)The electron starts out (at t=0)in the spin-up state with respect to the xaxis (that is:χ(0)=χ(x) +). Determineχ(t)at any subsequent time. Beware: This is a time- dependent Hamiltonian, so you cannot get χ(t)in the usual way from station- ary states. Fortunately, in this case you can solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (Equation 4.162 ) directly.

(d)What is the minimum ﬁeld (B0)required to force a complete ﬂip in Sx? 4.4.3 Addition of Angular Momenta Suppose now that we have twoparticles, with spins s1ands2. Say, the ﬁrst is in the state |s1m1/angbracketright and the second in the state |s2m2/angbracketright. We denote the composite state by |s1s2m1m2/angbracketright: S(1)2|s1s2m1m2/angbracketright=s1(s1+1)/planckover2pi12|s1s2m1m2/angbracketright, S(2)2|s1s2m1m2/angbracketright=s2(s2+1)/planckover2pi12|s1s2m1m2/angbracketright, S(1) z|s1s2m1m2/angbracketright=m1/planckover2pi1|s1s2m1m2/angbracketright, S(2) z|s1s2m1m2/angbracketright=m2/planckover2pi1|s1s2m1m2/angbracketright. (4.171) Question: What is the total angular momentum, S=S(1)+S(2), (4.172) of this system? That is to say: what is the net spin, s, of the combination, and what is the z component, m?T h e zcomponent is easy: Sz|s1s2m1m2/angbracketright=S(1) z|s1s2m1m2/angbracketright+S(2) z|s1s2m1m2/angbracketright, (4.173) =/planckover2pi1(m1+m2)|s1s2m1m2/angbracketright=/planckover2pi1m|s1s2m1m2/angbracketright, so m=m1+m2; (4.174) it’s just the sum.B u t sis much more subtle, so let’s begin with the simplest nontrivial example. Example 4.5 Consider the case of two spin-1 /2 particles—say, the electron and the proton in the ground state of hydrogen. Each can have spin up or spin down, so there are four possibilities in all:51 51More precisely, the composite system is in a linear combination of the four states listed. For spin 1 /2Iﬁ n dt h e arrows more evocative than the four-index kets, but you can always revert to the formal notation if you’re worried about it.4.4 Spin 177 |↑↑/angbracketright=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1 21 21 21 2/angbracketrightBig , m=1, |↑↓/angbracketright=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1 21 21 2−1 2/angbracketrightBig , m=0, |↓↑/angbracketright=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1 21 2−1 21 2/angbracketrightBig , m=0, |↓↓/angbracketright=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1 21 2−1 2−1 2/angbracketrightBig ,m=−1. This doesn’t look right: mis supposed to advance in integer steps, from −sto+s,s oi t appears that s=1—but there is an “extra” state with m=0. One way to untangle this problem is to apply the lowering operator, S−=S(1) −+S(2) −to the state|↑↑/angbracketright, using Equation 4.146 : S−|↑↑/angbracketright=/parenleftBig S(1) −|↑/angbracketright/parenrightBig |↑/angbracketright+|↑/angbracketright/parenleftBig S(2) −|↑/angbracketright/parenrightBig =(/planckover2pi1|↓/angbracketright)|↑/angbracketright+|↑/angbracketright(/planckover2pi1|↓/angbracketright)=/planckover2pi1(|↓↑/angbracketright+|↑↓/angbracketright). Evidently the three states with s=1 are (in the notation |sm/angbracketright): ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩|11/angbracketright=|↑↑/angbracketright |10/angbracketright=1√ 2(|↑↓/angbracketright+|↓↑/angbracketright) |1−1/angbracketright=|↓↓/angbracketright⎫ ⎪⎬ ⎪⎭s=1(triplet). (4.175) (As a check, try applying the lowering operator to |10/angbracketright; what should you get? See Problem 4.37(a).) This is called the triplet combination, for the obvious reason. Meanwhile, the orthogonal state with m=0 carries s=0: /braceleftbigg |00/angbracketright=1√ 2(|↑↓/angbracketright−|↓↑/angbracketright)/bracerightbigg s=0(singlet). (4.176) (If you apply the raising or lowering operator to thisstate, you’ll get zero. See Problem 4.37(b).) I claim, then, that the combination of two spin-1/2 particles can carry a total spin of 1 or 0, depending on whether they occupy the triplet or the singlet conﬁguration. To conﬁrm this, I need to prove that the triplet states are eigenvectors of S2with eigenvalue 2 /planckover2pi12, and the singlet is an eigenvector of S2with eigenvalue 0. Now, S2=/parenleftBig S(1)+S(2)/parenrightBig ·/parenleftBig S(1)+S(2)/parenrightBig =/parenleftBig S(1)/parenrightBig2 +/parenleftBig S(2)/parenrightBig2 +2S(1)·S(2).

It follows that S(1)·S(2)|10/angbracketright=/planckover2pi12 41√ 2(2|↓↑/angbracketright−|↑↓/angbracketright+2|↑↓/angbracketright−|↓↑/angbracketright)=/planckover2pi12 4|10/angbracketright, (4.178) and S(1)·S(2)|00/angbracketright=/planckover2pi12 41√ 2(2|↓↑/angbracketright−|↑↓/angbracketright−2|↑↓/angbracketright+|↓↑/angbracketright)=−3/planckover2pi12 4|00/angbracketright.(4.179) Returning to Equation 4.177 (and using Equation 4.142 ), we conclude that S2|10/angbracketright=/parenleftbigg3/planckover2pi12 4+3/planckover2pi12 4+2/planckover2pi12 4/parenrightbigg |10/angbracketright=2/planckover2pi12|10/angbracketright, (4.180) so|10/angbracketrightis indeed an eigenstate of S2with eigenvalue 2 /planckover2pi12; and S2|00/angbracketright=/parenleftbigg3/planckover2pi12 4+3/planckover2pi12 4−23/planckover2pi12 4/parenrightbigg |00/angbracketright=0, (4.181) so|00/angbracketrightis an eigenstate of S2with eigenvalue 0. (I will leave it for you to conﬁrm that |11/angbracketright and|1−1/angbracketrightare eigenstates of S2, with the appropriate eigenvalue—see Problem 4.37(c).) What we have just done (combining spin 1/2 with spin 1/2 to get spin 1 and spin 0) is the simplest example of a larger problem: If you combine spin s1with spin s2, what total spins s can you get?52The answer53is that you get every spin from (s1+s2)down to(s1−s2)—or (s2−s1),i fs2>s1—in integer steps: s=(s1+s2),(s1+s2−1),(s1+s2−2),...,|s1−s2|. (4.182) (Roughly speaking, the highest total spin occurs when the individual spins are aligned parallel to one another, and the lowest occurs when they are antiparallel.) For example, if you package together a particle of spin 3/2 with a particle of spin 2, you could get a total spin of 7/2, 5/2, 3/2, or 1/2, depending on the conﬁguration. Another example: If a hydrogen atom is in the stateψn/lscriptm, the net angular momentum of the electron (spin plus orbital) is /lscript+1/2o r/lscript−1/2; if you now throw in spin of the proton , the atom’s total angular momentum quantum number is/lscript+1,/lscript,o r/lscript−1 (and/lscriptcan be achieved in two distinct ways, depending on whether the electron alone is in the /lscript+1/2 conﬁguration or the /lscript−1/2 conﬁguration).

The constants Cs1s2s m1m2mare called Clebsch–Gordan coefﬁcients .Af e w of the simplest cases are listed in Table 4.8.54For example, the shaded column of the 2 ×1 table tells us that |30/angbracketright=1√ 5|21/angbracketright|1−1/angbracketright+/radicalbigg 3 5|20/angbracketright|10/angbracketright+1√ 5|2−1/angbracketright|11/angbracketright. If two particles (of spin 2 and spin 1) are at rest in a box, and the total spin is 3, and its z component is 0, then a measurement of S(1) zcould return the value /planckover2pi1(with probability 1/5), or 0 (with probability 3/5), or −/planckover2pi1(with probability 1/5). Notice that the probabilities add up to 1 (the sum of the squares of any column on the Clebsch–Gordan table is 1). These tables also work the other way around: |s1s2m1m2/angbracketright=/summationdisplay sCs1s2s m1m2m|sm/angbracketright,(m=m1+m2). (4.184) For example, the shaded rowin the 3/2×1 table tells us that /vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle3 211 20/angbracketrightBig =/radicalBig 3 5/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle5 21 2/angbracketrightBig +/radicalBig 1 15/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle3 21 2/angbracketrightBig −/radicalBig 1 3/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1 21 2/angbracketrightBig . If you put particles of spin 3/2 and spin 1 in the box, and you know that the ﬁrst has m1=1/2 and the second has m2=0( s o mis necessarily 1/2), and you measured the total spin, s, you could get 5/2 (with probability 3/5), or 3/2 (with probability 1/15), or 1/2 (with probability 1/3). Again, the sum of the probabilities is 1 (the sum of the squares of each rowon the Clebsch– Gordan table is 1). If you think this is starting to sound like mystical numerology, I don’t blame you. We will not be using the Clebsch–Gordan tables much in the rest of the book, but I wanted you to know 54The general formula is derived in Arno Bohm, Quantum Mechanics: Foundations and Applications , 2nd edn, Springer, 1986, p. 172.180 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions where they ﬁt into the scheme of things, in case you encounter them later on. In a mathematical sense this is all applied group theory —what we are talking about is the decomposition of the direct product of two irreducible representations of the rotation group into a direct sum of irreducible representations (you can quote that, to impress your friends). ∗ Problem 4.37 (a)Apply S−to|10/angbracketright(Equation 4.175 ), and conﬁrm that you get√ 2/planckover2pi1|1−1/angbracketright. (b)Apply S±to|00/angbracketright(Equation 4.176 ), and conﬁrm that you get zero. (c)Show that|11/angbracketrightand|1−1/angbracketright(Equation 4.175 ) are eigenstates of S2, with the appropriate eigenvalue. Problem 4.38 Quarks carry spin 1/2. Three quarks bind together to make a baryon (such as the proton or neutron); two quarks (or more precisely a quark and an antiquark) bind together to make a meson (such as the pion or the kaon). Assume the quarks are in the ground state (so the orbital angular momentum is zero). (a)What spins are possible for baryons? (b)What spins are possible for mesons? ∗ Problem 4.39 Verify Equations 4.175 and4.176 using the Clebsch–Gordan table. Problem 4.40 (a)A particle of spin 1 and a particle of spin 2 are at rest in a conﬁguration such that the total spin is 3, and its zcomponent is /planckover2pi1. If you measured the z-component of the angular momentum of the spin-2 particle, what values might you get, and what is the probability of each one? Comment: Using Clebsch–Gordan tables is like driving a stick-shift—scary and frustrating when you start out, but easy once you get the hang of it. (b)An electron with spin down is in the state ψ510of the hydrogen atom. If you could measure the total angular momentum squared of the electron alone ( notincluding the proton spin), what values might you get, and what is the probability of each? Problem 4.41 Determine the commutator of S2with S(1) z(where S≡S(1)+S(2)). Generalize your result to show that /bracketleftBig S2,S(1)/bracketrightBig =2i/planckover2pi1/parenleftBig S(1)×S(2)/parenrightBig . (4.185) Comment : Because S(1) zdoes not commute with S2, we cannot hope to ﬁnd states that are simultaneous eigenvectors of both. In order to form eigenstates of S2we need linear com- binations of eigenstates of S(1) z. This is precisely what the Clebsch–Gordan coefﬁcients (in Equation 4.183 ) do for us. On the other hand, it follows by obvious inference from Equation 4.185 that the sum S(1)+S(2)does commute with S2, which only conﬁrms what we already knew (see Equation 4.103 ).]4.5 Electromagnetic Interactions 181 4.5 ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERACTIONS 4.5.1 Minimal Coupling In classical electrodynamics55the force on a particle of charge qmoving with velocity v through electric and magnetic ﬁelds EandBis given by the Lorentz force law : F=q(E+v×B). (4.186) This force cannot be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential energy function, and there- fore the Schrödinger equation in its original form (Equation 1.1) cannot accommodate it. But in the more sophisticated form i/planckover2pi1∂/Psi1 ∂t=ˆH/Psi1 (4.187) there is no problem. The classical Hamiltonian for a particle of charge qand momentum p,i n the presence of electromagnetic ﬁelds is56 H=1 2m(p−qA)2+qϕ, (4.188) where Ais the vector potential and ϕis the scalar potential: E=−∇ϕ−∂A/∂t,B=∇×A. (4.189) Making the standard substitution p→− i/planckover2pi1∇, we obtain the Hamiltonian operator57 ˆH=1 2m(−i/planckover2pi1∇−qA)2+qϕ, (4.190) and the Schrödinger equation becomes i/planckover2pi1∂/Psi1 ∂t=/bracketleftbigg1 2m(−i/planckover2pi1∇−qA)2+qϕ/bracketrightbigg /Psi1. (4.191) This is the quantum implementation of the Lorentz force law; it is sometimes called the minimal coupling rule .58 ∗∗∗ Problem 4.42 (a)Using Equation 4.190 and the generalized Ehrenfest theorem ( 3.73), show that d/angbracketleftr/angbracketright dt=1 m/angbracketleft(p−qA)/angbracketright. (4.192) Hint: This stands for three equations—one for each component. Work it out for, say, the xcomponent, and then generalize your result. 55Readers who have not studied electrodynamics may want to skip Section 4.5. 56See, for example, Herbert Goldstein, Charles P. Poole, and John Safko, Classical Mechanics , 3rd edn, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 2002, page 342. 57In the case of electro statics we can choose A=0,a n d qϕis the potential energy V. 58Note that the potentials are given , just like the potential energy Vin the regular Schrödinger equation. In quantum electrodynamics (QED) the ﬁelds themselves are quantized, but that’s an entirely different theory.182 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions (b)As always (see Equation 1.32) we identify d/angbracketleftr/angbracketright/dtwith/angbracketleftv/angbracketright.

(4.193) (c)In particular, if the ﬁelds EandBareuniform over the volume of the wave packet, show that md/angbracketleftv/angbracketright dt=q(E+/angbracketleftv/angbracketright×B), (4.194) so the expectation value ofvmoves according to the Lorentz force law, as we would expect from Ehrenfest’s theorem. ∗∗∗ Problem 4.43 Suppose A=B0 2/parenleftbig xˆj−yˆı/parenrightbig ,andϕ=Kz2, where B0andKare constants.

The allowed energies,/parenleftBig n1+1 2/parenrightBig /planckover2pi1ω1, are called Landau Levels .60 4.5.2 The Aharonov–Bohm Effect In classical electrodynamics the potentials Aandϕare not uniquely determined; the physical quantities are the ﬁelds ,EandB.61Speciﬁcally, the potentials ϕ/prime≡ϕ−∂/Lambda1 ∂t,A/prime≡A+∇/Lambda1 (4.196) (where/Lambda1is an arbitrary real function of position and time) yield the same ﬁelds as ϕ and A. (Check that for yourself, using Equation 4.189 .) Equation 4.196 is called a gauge transformation , and the theory is said to be gauge invariant . In quantum mechanics the potentials play a more direct role (it is they, not the ﬁelds, that appear in the Equation 4.191 ), and it is of interest to ask whether the theory remains gauge invariant. It is easy to show (Problem 4.44) that 59Note that pdoes not commute with B,s o(p×B)/negationslash=−(B×p),b u t Adoes commute with B,s o(A×B)= −(B×A). 60For further discussion see Leslie E. Ballentine, Quantum Mechanics: A Modern Development , World Scientiﬁc, Singapore (1998), Section 11.3. 61See, for example, Grifﬁths (footnote 43), Section 10.1.2 .4.5 Electromagnetic Interactions 183 /Psi1/prime≡eiq/Lambda1//planckover2pi1/Psi1 (4.197) satisﬁes Equation 4.191 with the gauge-transformed potentials ϕ/primeandA/prime(Equation 4.196 ). Since/Psi1/primediffers from/Psi1only by a phase factor , it represents the same physical state,62and in this sense the theory isgauge invariant. For a long time it was taken for granted that there could be no electromagnetic inﬂuences in regions where EandBare zero—any more than there can be in the classical theory. But in 1959 Aharonov and Bohm63showed that the vector potential canaffect the quantum behavior of a charged particle, even when the particle is conﬁned to a region where the ﬁeld itself is zero. Example 4.6 Imagine a particle constrained to move in a circle of radius b(a bead on a wire ring, if you like). Along the axis runs a solenoid of radius a<b, carrying a steady electric current I (see Figure 4.16). If the solenoid is extremely long, the magnetic ﬁeld inside it is uniform, and the ﬁeld outside is zero. But the vector potential outside the solenoid is notzero; in fact (adopting the convenient gauge condition ∇·A=0),64 A=/Phi1 2πrˆφ, ( r>a), (4.198) where/Phi1=πa2Bis the magnetic ﬂux through the solenoid. Meanwhile, the solenoid itself is uncharged, so the scalar potential ϕis zero. In this case the Hamiltonian (Equation 4.190 ) becomes ˆH=1 2m/bracketleftBig −/planckover2pi12∇2+q2A2+2i/planckover2pi1qA·∇/bracketrightBig (4.199) (Problem 4.45(a)). But the wave function depends only on the azimuthal angle φ(θ=π/2 andr=b),s o∇→/parenleftBig ˆφ/b/parenrightBig (d/dφ), and the Schrödinger equation reads 1 2m/bracketleftBigg −/planckover2pi12 b2d2 dφ2+/parenleftbiggq/Phi1 2πb/parenrightbigg2 +i/planckover2pi1q/Phi1 πb2d dφ/bracketrightBigg ψ(φ)=Eψ(φ). (4.200) This is a linear differential equation with constant coefﬁcients: d2ψ dφ2−2iβdψ dφ+/epsilon1ψ=0, (4.201) where β≡q/Phi1 2π/planckover2pi1and/epsilon1≡2mb2E /planckover2pi12−β2. (4.202) 62That is to say, /angbracketleftr/angbracketright,d/angbracketleftr/angbracketright/dt, etc. are unchanged. Because /Lambda1depends on position, /angbracketleftp/angbracketright(with prepresented by the operator−i/planckover2pi1∇)does change, but as you found in Equation 4.192 ,pdoes not represent the mechanical momentum (mv)in this context (in Lagrangian mechanics p=mv+qAis the so-called canonical momentum ). 63Y .

Solutions are of the form ψ=Aeiλφ, (4.203) with λ=β±/radicalBig β2+/epsilon1=β±b /planckover2pi1√ 2mE. (4.204) Continuity ofψ(φ),a tφ=2π, requires thatλbe an integer : β±b /planckover2pi1√ 2mE=n, (4.205) and it follows that En=/planckover2pi12 2mb2/parenleftbigg n−q/Phi1 2π/planckover2pi1/parenrightbigg2 ,(n=0,±1,±2,...). (4.206) The solenoid lifts the two-fold degeneracy of the bead-on-a-ring (Problem 2.46): positive n, representing a particle traveling in the same direction as the current in the solenoid, has a somewhat lower energy (assuming qis positive) than negative n, describing a particle traveling in the opposite direction. More important, the allowed energies clearly depend on the ﬁeld inside the solenoid, even though the ﬁeld at the location of the particle is zero !65 More generally, suppose a particle is moving through a region where Bis zero (so ∇×A= 0), but Aitself is not. (I’ll assume that Ais static, although the method can be generalized to time-dependent potentials.) The Schrödinger equation, 65It is a peculiar property of superconducting rings that the enclosed ﬂux is quantized :/Phi1=(2π/planckover2pi1/q)n/prime,w h e r e n/prime is an integer. In that case the effect is undetectable, since En=/parenleftBig /planckover2pi12/2mb2/parenrightBig/parenleftbig n+n/prime/parenrightbig2,a n d/parenleftbig n+n/prime/parenrightbig is just another integer. (Incidentally, the charge qhere turns out to be twice the charge of an electron; the superconducting elec- trons are locked together in pairs.) However, ﬂux quantization is enforced by the superconductor (which induces circulating currents to make up the difference), not by the solenoid or the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and it does not occur in the (nonsuperconducting) example considered here.4.5 Electromagnetic Interactions 185 /bracketleftbigg1 2m(−i/planckover2pi1∇−qA)2/bracketrightbigg /Psi1=i/planckover2pi1∂/Psi1 ∂t, (4.207) can be simpliﬁed by writing /Psi1=eig/Psi1/prime, (4.208) where g(r)≡q /planckover2pi1/integraldisplayr OA/parenleftbig r/prime/parenrightbig ·dr/prime, (4.209) andOis some (arbitrarily chosen) reference point. (Note that this deﬁnition makes sense only when ∇×A=0throughout the region in question66—otherwise the line integral would depend on the path taken from Otor, and hence would not deﬁne a function of r.) In terms of /Psi1/prime, the gradient of /Psi1is ∇/Psi1=eig(i∇g)/Psi1/prime+eig/parenleftbig ∇/Psi1/prime/parenrightbig ; but∇g=(q//planckover2pi1)A,s o (−i/planckover2pi1∇−qA)/Psi1=−i/planckover2pi1eig∇/Psi1/prime, (4.210) and it follows that (−i/planckover2pi1∇−qA)2/Psi1=−/planckover2pi12eig∇2/Psi1/prime(4.211) (Problem 4.45(b)). Putting this into Equation 4.207 , and cancelling the common factor of eig, we are left with −/planckover2pi12 2m∇2/Psi1/prime=i/planckover2pi1∂/Psi1/prime ∂t. (4.212) Evidently/Psi1/primesatisﬁes the Schrödinger equation without A. If we can solve Equation 4.212 , correcting for the presence of a (curl-free) vector potential will be trivial: just tack on the phase factor eig. Aharonov and Bohm proposed an experiment in which a beam of electrons is split in two, and they pass either side of a long solenoid before recombining (Figure 4.17). The beams are kept well away from the solenoid itself, so they encounter only regions where B=0.B u t A, which is given by Equation 4.198 ,i snotzero, and the two beams arrive with different phases :67 g=q /planckover2pi1/integraldisplay A·dr=q/Phi1 2π/planckover2pi1/integraldisplay/parenleftbigg1 rˆφ/parenrightbigg ·/parenleftBig rˆφdφ/parenrightBig =±q/Phi1 2/planckover2pi1. (4.213) 66The region in question must also be simply connected (no holes). This might seem like a technicality, but in the present example we need to excise the solenoid itself, and that leaves a hole in the space. To get around this we treat each sideof the solenoid as a separate simply-connected region. If that bothers you, you’re not alone; it seems to have bothered Aharanov and Bohm as well, since—in addition to this argument—they provided an alternative solution to conﬁrm their result (Y . Aharonov and D. Bohm, Phys. Rev. 115, 485 (1959)). The Aharonov–Bohm effect can also be cast as an example of Berry’s phase (see Chapter 11), where this issue does not arise (M. Berry, Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. A 392 , 45 (1984)). 67Use cylindrical coordinates centered on the axis of the solenoid; put Oon the incoming beam, and let φrun 0<π on one side and 0 >−πon the other, with r>aalways.186 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions Beam splitAB SolenoidBeam recombinedI Figure 4.17: The Aharonov–Bohm effect: The electron beam splits, with half passing either side of a long solenoid. The plus sign applies to the electrons traveling in the same direction as A—which is to say, in the same direction as the current in the solenoid. The beams arrive out of phase by an amount proportional to the magnetic ﬂux their paths encircle: phase difference =q/Phi1 /planckover2pi1. (4.214) This phase shift leads to measurable interference, which has been conﬁrmed experimentally by Chambers and others.68 What are we to make of the Aharonov–Bohm effect? It seems our classical preconceptions are simply mistaken : There canbe electromagnetic effects in regions where the ﬁelds are zero. Note, however, that this does not make Aitself measurable—only the enclosed ﬂuxcomes into the ﬁnal answer, and the theory remains gauge invariant.69 ∗∗ Problem 4.44 Show that/Psi1/prime(Equation 4.197 ) satisﬁes the Schrödinger equation (Equation 4.191 with the potentials ϕ/primeandA/prime(Equation 4.196 ).

In Problem 4.11 you showed that the ﬁnite spherical well (three dimensions) has nobound state, if the potential is sufﬁciently weak. Question: What about the ﬁnite circular well (two 71Schrödinger ( Annalen der Physik 81, 109 (1926), Section 7) interpreted eJas the electric current density (this was before Born published his statistical interpretation of the wave function), and noted that it is time-independent (in a stationary state): “we may in a certain sense speak of a return to electrostatic and magnetostatic atomic models .I n this way the lack of radiation in [a stationary] state would, indeed, ﬁnd a startlingly simple explanation.” (I thank Kirk McDonald for calling this reference to my attention.)Further Problems on Chapter 4 189 dimensions)?

Problem 4.52 (a)Construct the spatial wave function (ψ)for hydrogen in the state n=3,/lscript=2, m=1. Express your answer as a function of r,θ,φ, and a(the Bohr radius) only—no other variables ( ρ,z, etc.) or functions ( Y,v, etc.), or constants ( A,c0, etc.), or derivatives, allowed ( πis okay, and e, and 2, etc.). (b)Check that this wave function is properly normalized, by carrying out the appropriate integrals over r,θ, andφ. (c)Find the expectation value of rsin this state.

(c)If you could somehow measure the observable L2 x+L2 yon an atom in this state, what value (or values) could you get, and what is the probability of each? Problem 4.54 What is the probability that an electron in the ground state of hydrogen will be found inside the nucleus ? (a)First calculate the exact answer, assuming the wave function (Equation 4.80)i s correct all the way down to r=0. Let bbe the radius of the nucleus. (b)Expand your result as a power series in the small number /epsilon1≡2b/a, and show that the lowest-order term is the cubic: P≈(4/3)(b/a)3. This should be a suitable approximation, provided that b/lessmucha(which it is). (c)Alternatively, we might assume that ψ(r)is essentially constant over the (tiny) volume of the nucleus, so that P≈(4/3)πb3|ψ(0)|2. Check that you get the same answer this way. (d)Use b≈10−15m and a≈0.5×10−10m to get a numerical estimate for P. Roughly speaking, this represents the “fraction of its time that the electron spends inside the nucleus.” Problem 4.55 (a)Use the recursion formula (Equation 4.76) to conﬁrm that when /lscript=n−1t h e radial wave function takes the form Rn(n−1)=Nnrn−1e−r/na, and determine the normalization constant Nnby direct integration.

Note that the fractional spread in rdecreases, with increasing n(in this sense the system “begins to look classical,” with identiﬁable circular “orbits,” for large n). Sketch the radial wave functions for several values of n, to illustrate this point. Problem 4.56 Coincident spectral lines.72According to the Rydberg formula (Equation 4.93) the wavelength of a line in the hydrogen spectrum is determined by the principal quantum numbers of the initial and ﬁnal states.

Consider three spin-1/2 particles arranged on the corners of a triangle and interacting via the Hamiltonian H=J(S1·S2+S2·S3+S3·S1), (4.227) where Jis a positive constant. This interaction favors opposite alignment of neigh- boring spins ( antiferromagnetism , if they are magnetic dipoles), but the triangular arrangement means that this condition cannot be satisﬁed simultaneously for all three pairs (Figure 4.18). This is known as geometrical “frustration.” (a)Show that the Hamiltonian can be written in terms of the square of the total spin, S2, where S=/summationtext iSi. (b)Determine the ground state energy, and its degeneracy.

In contrast, there is no such frustration with four spins arranged around a square.194 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions ∗∗ Problem 4.68 Imagine a hydrogen atom at the center of an inﬁnite spherical well of radius b. We will take bto be much greater than the Bohr radius (a),s ot h el o w - nstates are not much affected by the distant “wall” at r=b. But since u(b)=0 we can use the method of Problem 2.61 to solve the radial equation ( 4.53) numerically. (a)Show thatvj(in Problem 2.61) takes the form vj=−2β j+/lscript(/lscript+1) j2whereβ≡b (N+1)a. (b)We want/Delta1r/lessmucha(so as to sample a reasonable number of points within the potential) and a/lessmuchb(so the wall doesn’t distort the atom too much). Thus 1/lessmuchβ−1/lessmuchN. Let’s useβ=1/50 and N=1000. Find the three lowest eigenvalues of H,f o r /lscript=0,/lscript=1, and/lscript=2, and plot the corresponding eigenfunctions. Com- pare the known (Bohr) energies (Equation 4.70).Note: Unless the wave function drops to zero well before r=b, the energies of this system cannot be expected to match those of free hydrogen, but they are of interest in their own right as allowed energies of “compressed” hydrogen.73 ∗∗ Problem 4.69 Find a few of the Bohr energies for hydrogen by “wagging the dog” (Prob- lem2.55), starting with Equation 4.53—or, better yet, Equation 4.56; in fact, why not use Equation 4.68 to setρ0=2n, and tweak n? We know that the correct solutions occur when nis a positive integer, so you might start with n=0.9, 1.9, 2.9, etc., and increase it in small increments—the tail should wag when you pass 1, 2, 3, .... F i n d the lowest three ns, to four signiﬁcant digits, ﬁrst for /lscript=0, and then for /lscript=1 and /lscript=2.Warning: Mathematica doesn’t like to divide by zero, so you might change ρto (ρ+0.000001)in the denominator. Note: u(0)=0 in all cases, but u/prime(0)=0 only for/lscript≥1 (Equation 4.59). So for/lscript=0 you can use u(0)=0,u/prime(0)=1. For/lscript>0 you might be tempted to use u(0)=0 and u/prime(0)=0, but Mathematica is lazy, and will go for the trivial solution u(ρ)≡0; better, therefore, to use (say) u(1)=1 and u/prime(0)=0. Problem 4.70 Sequential Spin Measurements. (a)At time t=0 a large ensemble of spin-1/2 particles is prepared, all of them in the spin-up state (with respect to the zaxis).74They are not subject to any forces or torques. At time t1>0 each spin is measured—some along the zdirection and others along the xdirection (but we aren’t told the results). At time t2>t1 their spin is measured again, this time along the xdirection, and those with spin up (along x) are saved as a subensemble (those with spin down are discarded). Question: Of those remaining (the subensemble), what fraction had spin up (along zorx, depending on which was measured) in the ﬁrst measurement? 73For a variety of reasons this system has been much studied in the literature. See, for example, J. M. Ferreyra and C. R. Proetto, A m .J .P h y s . 81, 860 (2013). 74N. D. Mermin, Physics Today , October 2011, page 8.Further Problems on Chapter 4 195 (b)Part (a) was easy—trivial, really, once you see it. Here’s a more pithy general- ization: At time t=0 an ensemble of spin-1/2 particles is prepared, all in the spin-up state along direction a. At time t1>0 their spins are measured along direction b(but we are not told the results), and at time t2>t1their spins are measured along direction c. Those with spin up (along c) are saved as a subensem- ble. Of the particles in this subensemble, what fraction had spin up (along b)i n the ﬁrst measurement? Hint: Use Equation 4.155 to show that the probability of getting spin up (along b) in the ﬁrst measurement is P+=cos2(θab/2), and (by extension) the probability of getting spin up in both measurements is P++= cos2(θab/2)cos2(θbc/2). Find the other three probabilities (P+−,P−+, and P−−). Beware: If the outcome of the ﬁrst measurement was spin down , the relevant angle is now the supplement ofθbc.Answer:/bracketleftbig 1+tan2(θab/2)tan2(θbc/2)/bracketrightbig−1. Problem 4.71 In molecular and solid-state applications, one often uses a basis of orbitals aligned with the cartesian axes rather than the basis ψn/lscriptmused throughout this chapter. For example, the orbitals ψ2px(r,θ,φ)=1√ 32πa3x ae−r/2a ψ2py(r,θ,φ)=1√ 32πa3y ae−r/2a ψ2pz(r,θ,φ)=1√ 32πa3z ae−r/2a are a basis for the hydrogen states with n=2 and/lscript=1. (a)Show that each of these orbitals can be written as a linear combination of the orbitalsψn/lscriptmwith n=2,/lscript=1, and m=−1,0,1. (b)Show that the states ψ2piare eigenstates of the corresponding component of angular momentum: ˆLi. What is the eigenvalue in each case. (c)Make contour plots (as in Figure 4.9) for the three orbitals. In Mathematica use ContourPlot3D . Problem 4.72 Consider a particle with charge q,m a s s m, and spin s, in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B0. The vector potential can be chosen as A=−1 2r×B0. (a)Verify that this vector potential produces a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B0. (b)Show that the Hamiltonian can be written H=p2 2m+qϕ−B0·(γoL+γS)+q2 8m/bracketleftBig r2B2 0−(r·B0)2/bracketrightBig , (4.230) whereγo=q/2mis the gyromagnetic ratio for orbital motion. Note:T h e term linear in B0makes it energetically favorable for the magnetic moments196 CHAPTER 4 Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions (orbital and spin) to align with the magnetic ﬁeld; this is the origin of param- agnetism in materials. The term quadratic in B0leads to the opposite effect: diamagnetism .75 Problem 4.73 Example 4.4, couched in terms of forces, was a quasi-classical explanation for the Stern–Gerlach effect. Starting from the Hamiltonian for a neutral, spin-1 /2 particle traveling through the magnetic ﬁeld given by Equation 4.169 , H=p2 2m−γB·S, use the generalized Ehrenfest theorem (Equation 3.73) to show that md2 dt2/angbracketleftz/angbracketright=γα/angbracketleftSz/angbracketright. Comment : Equation 4.170 is therefore a correct quantum-mechanical statement, with the understanding that the quantities refer to expectation values. Problem 4.74 Neither Example 4.4nor Problem 4.73 actually solved the Schrödinger equation for the Stern–Gerlach experiment. In this problem we will see how to set up that calculation. The Hamiltonian for a neutral, spin-1 /2 particle traveling through a Stern–Gerlach device is H=p2 2m−γB·S where Bis given by Equation 4.169 . The most general wave function for a spin-1 /2 particle—including both spatial and spin degrees of freedom—is76 /Psi1(r,t)=/Psi1+(r,t)χ++/Psi1−(r,t)χ−. (a)Put/Psi1(r,t)into the Schrödinger equation H/Psi1=i/planckover2pi1∂ ∂t/Psi1 to obtain a pair of coupled equations for /Psi1±.Partial answer: −/planckover2pi12 2m∇2/Psi1+−/planckover2pi1 2γ(B0+αz)/Psi1++/planckover2pi1 2γαx/Psi1−=i/planckover2pi1∂ ∂t/Psi1+. (b)We know from Example 4.3that the spin will precess in a uniform ﬁeld B0ˆk.W e can factor this behavior out of our solution—with no loss of generality—by writing /Psi1±(r,t)=e±iγB0t/2˜/Psi1(r,t). Find the coupled equations for ˜/Psi1±.Partial answer: −/planckover2pi12 2m∇2˜/Psi1+−/planckover2pi1 2γαz˜/Psi1++/planckover2pi1 2γαxe−iγB0t˜/Psi1−=i/planckover2pi1∂ ∂t˜/Psi1+. 75That’s not obvious but we’ll prove it in Chapter 7. 76In this notation, |/Psi1+(r)|2d3rgives the probability of ﬁnding the particle in the vicinity of rwith spin up, and similarly measuring its spin along the zaxis to be up, and similarly for |/Psi1−(r)|2d3rwith spin down.Further Problems on Chapter 4 197 (c)If one ignores the oscillatory term in the solution to (b)—on the grounds that it averages to zero (see discussion in Example 4.4)—one obtains uncoupled equations of the form −/planckover2pi12 2m∇2˜/Psi1±+V±˜/Psi1±=i/planckover2pi1∂ ∂t˜/Psi1±. Based upon the motion you would expect for a particle in the “potential” V±, explain the Stern–Gerlach experiment. Problem 4.75 Consider the system of Example 4.6, now with a time-dependent ﬂux /Phi1(t) through the solenoid.

Problem 4.76 The shift in the energy levels in Example 4.6can be understood from classi- cal electrodynamics. Consider the case where initially no current ﬂows in the solenoid. Now imagine slowly increasing the current. (a)Calculate (from classical electrodynamics) the emf produced by the changing ﬂux and show that the rate at which work is done on the charge conﬁned to the ring can be written dW d/Phi1=−qω 2π, whereωis the angular velocity of the particle. (b)Calculate the zcomponent of the mechanical angular momentum,77 Lmechanical=r×mv=r×(p−qA), (4.231) for a particle in the state ψnin Example 4.6. Note that the mechanical angular momentum is not quantized in integer multiples of /planckover2pi1!78 (c)Show that your result from part (a) is precisely equal to the rate at which the stationary state energies change as the ﬂux is increased: dEn/d/Phi1. 77See footnote 62for a discussion of the difference between the canonical and mechanical momentum. 78However, the electromagnetic ﬁelds alsocarry angular momentum, and the total (mechanical plus electromagnetic) is quantized in integer multiples of /planckover2pi1.

Peshkin, Physics Reports 80, 375 (1981) or Chapter 1 of Frank Wilczek, Fractional Statistics and Anyon Superconductivity , World Scientiﬁc, New Jersey (1990).5IDENTICAL PARTICLES 5.1 TWO-PARTICLE SYSTEMS For a single particle,/Psi1(r,t)is a function of the spatial coordinates, r, and the time, t(I’ll ignore spin, for the moment). The state of a two-particle system is a function of the coordinates of particle one(r1), the coordinates of particle two (r2), and the time: /Psi1(r1,r2,t). (5.1) Its time evolution is determined by the Schrödinger equation: i/planckover2pi1∂/Psi1 ∂t=ˆH/Psi1, (5.2) where His the Hamiltonian for the whole works: ˆH=−/planckover2pi12 2m1∇2 1−/planckover2pi12 2m2∇2 2+V(r1,r2,t) (5.3) (the subscript on ∇indicates differentiation with respect to the coordinates of particle 1 or particle 2, as the case may be). The statistical interpretation carries over in the obvious way: |/Psi1(r1,r2,t)|2d3r1d3r2 (5.4) is the probability of ﬁnding particle 1 in the volume d3r1andparticle 2 in the volume d3r2;a s always,/Psi1must be normalized: /integraldisplay |/Psi1(r1,r2,t)|2d3r1d3r2=1. (5.5) For time-independent potentials, we obtain a complete set of solutions by separation of variables: /Psi1(r1,r2,t)=ψ(r1,r2)e−iEt//planckover2pi1, (5.6) where the spatial wave function (ψ)satisﬁes the time-independent Schrödinger equation: −/planckover2pi12 2m1∇2 1ψ−/planckover2pi12 2m2∇2 2ψ+Vψ=Eψ, (5.7) andEis the total energy of the system. In general, solving Equation 5.7is difﬁcult, but two special cases can be reduced to one-particle problems: 1.Noninteracting particles. Suppose the particles do not interact with one another, but each is subject to some external force. For example, they might be attached to two different springs. In that case the total potential energy is the sumof the two: V(r1,r2)=V1(r1)+V2(r2), (5.8)5.1 Two-Particle Systems 199 and Equation 5.7can be solved by separation of variables: ψ(r1,r2)=ψa(r1)ψb(r2). (5.9) Plugging Equation 5.9into Equation 5.7, dividing byψ(r1,r2), and collecting the terms inr1alone and in r2alone, we ﬁnd that ψa(r1)andψb(r2)each satisfy the one-particle Schrödinger equation: −/planckover2pi12 2m1∇2 1ψa(r1)+V1(r1)ψa(r1)=Eaψa(r1), −/planckover2pi12 2m2∇2 2ψb(r2)+V2(r2)ψb(r2)=Ebψb(r2), (5.10) andE=Ea+Eb. In this case the two-particle wave function is a simple product of one-particle wave functions, /Psi1(r1,r2,t)=ψa(r1)ψb(r2)e−i(Ea+Eb)t//planckover2pi1(5.11) =/parenleftBig ψa(r1)e−iEat//planckover2pi1/parenrightBig/parenleftBig ψb(r2)e−iEbt//planckover2pi1/parenrightBig =/Psi1a(r1,t)/Psi1b(r2,t), and it makes sense to say that particle 1 is in state a, and particle 2 is in state b. But any linear combination of such solutions will still satisfy the (time-dependent) Schrödinger equation—for instance /Psi1(r1,r2,t)=3 5/Psi1a(r1,t)/Psi1b(r2,t)+4 5/Psi1c(r1,t)/Psi1d(r2,t). (5.12) In this case the state of particle 1 depends on the state of particle 2, and vice versa. If you measured the energy of particle 1, you might get Ea(with probability 9/25), in which case the energy of particle 2 is deﬁnitely Eb, or you might get Ec(probability 16/25), in which case the energy of particle 2 is Ed. We say that the two particles are entangled (Schrödinger’s lovely term). An entangled state is one that cannot be written as a product of single-particle states.1 2.Central potentials. Suppose the particles interact only with one another, via a potential that depends on their separation: V(r1,r2)→V(|r1−r2|). (5.13) The hydrogen atom would be an example, if you include the motion of the proton. In this case the two-body problem reduces to an equivalent one-body problem, just as it does in classical mechanics (see Problem 5.1). In general, though, the two particles will be subject both to external forces andto mutual interactions, and this makes the analysis more complicated. For example, think of the two electrons in a helium atom: each feels the Coulomb attraction of the nucleus (charge 2 e), and at the same time they repel one another: V(r1,r2)=1 4π/epsilon10/parenleftbigg −2e2 |r1|−2e2 |r2|+e2 |r1−r2|/parenrightbigg . (5.14) We’ll take up this problem in later sections. 1The classic example of an entangled state is two spin-1/2 particles in the singlet conﬁguration (Equation 4.176 ).200 CHAPTER 5 Identical Particles ∗∗ Problem 5.1 A typical interaction potential depends only on the vector displacement r≡ r1−r2between the two particles: V(r1,r2)→V(r). In that case the Schrödinger equation separates, if we change variables from r1,r2torandR≡(m1r1+m2r2)/(m1+m2) (the center of mass). (a)Show that r1=R+(μ/m1)r,r2=R−(μ/m2)r, and∇1=(μ/m2)∇R+∇ r, ∇2=(μ/m1)∇R−∇ r, where μ≡m1m2 m1+m2(5.15) is the reduced mass of the system. (b)Show that the (time-independent) Schrödinger equation ( 5.7) becomes −/planckover2pi12 2(m1+m2)∇2 Rψ−/planckover2pi12 2μ∇2 rψ+V(r)ψ=Eψ. (c)Separate the variables, letting ψ(R,r)=ψR(R)ψr(r). Note thatψRsatisﬁes the one-particle Schrödinger equation, with the total mass(m1+m2)in place of m, potential zero, and energy ER, whileψrsatisﬁes the one-particle Schrödinger equa- tion with the reduced mass in place of m, potential V(r), and energy Er. The total energy is the sum: E=ER+Er. What this tells us is that the center of mass moves like a free particle, and the relative motion (that is, the motion of particle 2 with respect to particle 1) is the same as if we had a single particle with the reduced mass, subject to the potential V. Exactly the same decomposition occurs in classical mechanics;2it reduces the two-body problem to an equivalent one-body problem. Problem 5.2 In view of Problem 5.1, we can correct for the motion of the nucleus in hydrogen by simply replacing the electron mass with the reduced mass. (a)Find (to two signiﬁcant digits) the percent error in the binding energy of hydrogen (Equation 4.77) introduced by our use of minstead ofμ. (b)Find the separation in wavelength between the red Balmer lines (n=3→n=2) for hydrogen and deuterium (whose nucleus contains a neutron as well as the proton). (c)Find the binding energy of positronium (in which the proton is replaced by a positron—positrons have the same mass as electrons, but opposite charge). (d)Suppose you wanted to conﬁrm the existence of muonic hydrogen , in which the electron is replaced by a muon (same charge, but 206.77 times heav- ier). Where (i.e. at what wavelength) would you look for the “Lyman- α” line (n=2→n=1)? 2See, for example, Jerry B. Marion and Stephen T. Thornton, Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems , 4th edn, Saunders, Fort Worth, TX (1995), Section 8.2.5.1 Two-Particle Systems 201 Problem 5.3 Chlorine has two naturally occurring isotopes, Cl35and Cl37. Show that the vibrational spectrum of HCl should consist of closely spaced doublets, with a splitting given by/Delta1ν=7.51×10−4ν, whereνis the frequency of the emitted photon. Hint: Think of it as a harmonic oscillator, with ω=√k/μ, whereμis the reduced mass (Equation 5.15) and kis presumably the same for both isotopes. 5.1.1 Bosons and Fermions Suppose we have two noninteracting particles, number 1 in the (one-particle) state ψa(r), and number 2 in the state ψb(r). In that caseψ(r1,r2)is the product (Equation 5.9): ψ(r1,r2)=ψa(r1)ψb(r2). (5.16) Of course, this assumes that we can tell the particles apart—otherwise it wouldn’t make any sense to claim that number 1 is in state ψaand number 2 is in state ψb; all we could say is thatoneof them is in the state ψaand the other is in state ψb, but we wouldn’t know which is which. If we were talking classical mechanics this would be a silly objection: You can always tell the particles apart, in principle—just paint one of them red and the other one blue, or stamp identiﬁcation numbers on them, or hire private detectives to follow them around. But in quantum mechanics the situation is fundamentally different: You can’t paint an electron red, or pin a label on it, and a detective’s observations will inevitably and unpredictably alter its state, raising the possibility that the two particles might have secretly switched places. The fact is, all electrons are utterly identical , in a way that no two classical objects can ever be. It’s not just that wedon’t know which electron is which; God doesn’t know which is which, because there is really no such thing as “this” electron, or “that” electron; all we can legitimately speak about is “an” electron. Quantum mechanics neatly accommodates the existence of particles that are indistinguish- able in principle : We simply construct a wave function that is noncommittal as to which particle is in which state. There are actually two ways to do it: ψ±(r1,r2)=A[ψa(r1)ψb(r2)±ψb(r1)ψa(r2)]; (5.17) the theory admits two kinds of identical particles: bosons (the plus sign), and fermions (the minus sign). Boson states are symmetric under interchange, ψ+(r2,r1)=ψ+(r1,r2); fermion states are antisymmetric under interchange, ψ−(r2,r1)=−ψ−(r1,r2). It so happens that /braceleftBigg all particles with integer spin are bosons, and all particles with half integer spin are fermions.(5.18) This connection between spin and statistics (bosons and fermions have quite different statis- tical properties) can be proved inrelativistic quantum mechanics; in the nonrelativistic theory it is simply taken as an axiom.3 3It seems strange that relativity should have anything to do with it, and there has been a lot of discussion as to whether it might be possible to prove the spin-statistics connection in other ways. See, for example, Robert C. Hilborn, Am. J. Phys. 63, 298 (1995); Ian Duck and E. C. G. Sudarshan, Pauli and the Spin-Statistics Theorem , World Sci- entiﬁc, Singapore (1997). For a comprehensive bibliography on spin and statistics see C. Curceanu, J. D. Gillaspy, and R. C. Hilborn, A m .J .P h y s . 80, 561 (2010).202 CHAPTER 5 Identical Particles It follows, in particular, that two identical fermions (for example, two electrons) cannot occupy the same state .F o ri fψa=ψb, then ψ−(r1,r2)=A[ψa(r1)ψa(r2)−ψa(r1)ψa(r2)]=0, and we are left with no wave function at all.4This is the famous Pauli exclusion principle . It is not (as you may have been led to believe) a weird ad hoc assumption applying only to electrons, but rather a consequence of the rules for constructing two-particle wave functions, applying to allidentical fermions. Example 5.1 Suppose we have two noninteracting (they pass right through one another ...n e v e r m i n d how you would set this up in practice!) particles, both of mass m, in the inﬁnite square well (Section 2.2). The one-particle states are ψn(x)=/radicalbigg 2 asin/parenleftBignπ ax/parenrightBig ,En=n2K (where K≡π2/planckover2pi12/2ma2). If the particles are distinguishable , with number 1 in state n1 and number 2 in state n2, the composite wave function is a simple product: ψn1n2(x1,x2)=ψn1(x1)ψn2(x2),En1n2=/parenleftBig n2 1+n2 2/parenrightBig K. For example, the ground state is ψ11=2 asin/parenleftBigπx1 a/parenrightBig sin/parenleftBigπx2 a/parenrightBig ,E11=2K; the ﬁrst excited state is doubly degenerate: ψ12=2 asin/parenleftBigπx1 a/parenrightBig sin/parenleftbigg2πx2 a/parenrightbigg ,E12=5K, ψ21=2 asin/parenleftbigg2πx1 a/parenrightbigg sin/parenleftBigπx2 a/parenrightBig ,E21=5K; and so on. If the two particles are identical bosons , the ground state is unchanged, but the ﬁrst excited state is nondegenerate : √ 2 a/bracketleftbigg sin/parenleftBigπx1 a/parenrightBig sin/parenleftbigg2πx2 a/parenrightbigg +sin/parenleftbigg2πx1 a/parenrightbigg sin/parenleftBigπx2 a/parenrightBig/bracketrightbigg (still with energy 5 K). And if the particles are identical fermions , there is nostate with energy 2 K; the ground state is √ 2 a/bracketleftbigg sin/parenleftBigπx1 a/parenrightBig sin/parenleftbigg2πx2 a/parenrightbigg −sin/parenleftbigg2πx1 a/parenrightbigg sin/parenleftBigπx2 a/parenrightBig/bracketrightbigg , and its energy is 5 K. 4I’m still leaving out the spin, don’t forget—if this bothers you (after all, a spinless fermion is an oxymoron), assume they’re in the same spin state. I’ll show you how spin affects the story in Section 5.1.35.1 Two-Particle Systems 203 ∗ Problem 5.4 (a)Ifψaandψbare orthogonal, and both are normalized, what is the constant Ain Equation 5.17? (b)Ifψa=ψb(and it is normalized), what is A? (This case, of course, occurs only for bosons.) Problem 5.5 (a)Write down the Hamiltonian for two noninteracting identical particles in the inﬁ- nite square well. Verify that the fermion ground state given in Example 5.1is an eigenfunction of ˆH, with the appropriate eigenvalue. (b)Find the next two excited states (beyond the ones given in the example)—wave functions, energies, and degeneracies—for each of the three cases (distinguishable, identical bosons, identical fermions). 5.1.2 Exchange Forces To give you some sense of what the symmetrization requirement (Equation 5.17) actually does, I’m going to work out a simple one-dimensional example. Suppose one particle is in state ψa(x), and the other is in state ψb(x), and these two states are orthogonal and normalized. If the two particles are distinguishable, and number 1 is the one in state ψa, then the combined wave function is ψ(x1,x2)=ψa(x1)ψb(x2); (5.19) if they are identical bosons, the composite wave function is (see Problem 5.4for the normalization) ψ+(x1,x2)=1√ 2[ψa(x1)ψb(x2)+ψb(x1)ψa(x2)]; (5.20) and if they are identical fermions, it is ψ−(x1,x2)=1√ 2[ψa(x1)ψb(x2)−ψb(x1)ψa(x2)]. (5.21) Let’s calculate the expectation value of the square of the separation distance between the two particles,/angbracketleftbig (x1−x2)2/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbig x2 1/angbracketrightbig +/angbracketleftbig x2 2/angbracketrightbig −2/angbracketleftbig x1x2/angbracketrightbig .

Notice that/angbracketleftx/angbracketrightabvanishes unless the two wave functions actually overlap :i fψa(x)is zero whereverψb(x)isnonzero, the integral in Equation 5.24 is zero. So ifψarepresents an electron5.1 Two-Particle Systems 205 in an atom in Chicago, and ψbrepresents an electron in an atom in Seattle, it’s not going to make any difference whether you antisymmetrize the wave function or not. As a practical matter, therefore, it’s okay to pretend that electrons with non-overlapping wave functions are distinguishable. (Indeed, this is the only thing that allows chemists to proceed at all,f o ri n principle every electron in the universe is linked to every other one, via the antisymmetrization of their wave functions, and if this really mattered , you wouldn’t be able to talk about any one unless you were prepared to deal with them all!) The interesting case is when the overlap integral (Equation 5.24)i snotzero. The sys- tem behaves as though there were a “force of attraction” between identical bosons, pulling them closer together, and a “force of repulsion” between identical fermions, pushing them apart (remember that we are for the moment ignoring spin). We call it an exchange force , although it’s not really a force at all5—no physical agency is pushing on the particles; rather, it is a purely geometrical consequence of the symmetrization requirement. It is also a strictly quantum mechanical phenomenon, with no classical counterpart. ∗ Problem 5.6 Imagine two noninteracting particles, each of mass m, in the inﬁnite square well. If one is in the state ψn(Equation 2.28), and the other in state ψl(l/negationslash=n), calculate/angbracketleftbig (x1−x2)2/angbracketrightbig , assuming (a) they are distinguishable particles, (b) they are identical bosons, and (c) they are identical fermions. ∗∗ Problem 5.7 Two noninteracting particles (of equal mass) share the same harmonic oscillator potential, one in the ground state and one in the ﬁrst excited state. (a)Construct the wave function, ψ(x1,x2), assuming (i) they are distinguishable, (ii) they are identical bosons, (iii) they are identical fermions. Plot |ψ(x1,x2)|2in each case (use, for instance, Mathematica’s Plot3D ). (b)Use Equations 5.23 and5.25 to determine/angbracketleftbig (x1−x2)2/angbracketrightbig for each case.

Graph P(r)for the three cases. (d)Deﬁne the density operator by n(x)=2/summationdisplay i=1δ(x−xi); /angbracketleftn(x)/angbracketrightdxis the expected number of particles in the interval dx. Compute/angbracketleftn(x)/angbracketright for each of the three cases and plot your results. (The result may surprise you.) 5For an incisive critique of this terminology see W. J. Mullin and G. Blaylock, A m .J .P h y s . 71, 1223 (2003).206 CHAPTER 5 Identical Particles Problem 5.8 Suppose you had three particles, one in state ψa(x), one in stateψb(x), and one in stateψc(x). Assumingψa,ψb, andψcare orthonormal, construct the three-particle states (analogous to Equations 5.19,5.20, and 5.21) representing (a) distinguishable par- ticles, (b) identical bosons, and (c) identical fermions. Keep in mind that (b) must be completely symmetric, under interchange of anypair of particles, and (c) must be com- pletely anti-symmetric, in the same sense. Comment : There’s a cute trick for constructing completely antisymmetric wave functions: Form the Slater determinant , whose ﬁrst row isψa(x1),ψb(x1),ψc(x1), etc., whose second row is ψa(x2),ψb(x2),ψc(x2), etc., and so on (this device works for any number of particles).6 5.1.3 Spin It is time to bring spin into the story. The complete state of an electron (say) includes not only its position wave function, but also a spinor, describing the orientation of its spin:7 ψ(r)χ. (5.27) When we put together the two-particle state,8 ψ(r1,r2)χ(1,2) (5.28) it is the whole works , not just the spatial part, that has to be antisymmetric with respect to exchange: ψ(r1,r2)χ(1,2)=−ψ(r2,r1)χ(2,1). (5.29) Now, a glance back at the composite spin states (Equations 4.175 and4.176 ) reveals that the singlet combination is antisymmetric (and hence would have to be joined with a symmetric spatial function), whereas the three triplet states are all symmetric (and would require an anti- symmetric spatial function). Thus the Pauli principle actually allows twoelectrons in a given position state, as long as their spins are in the singlet conﬁguration (but they could not be in the same position state andin the same spin state—say, both spin up). ∗∗ Problem 5.9 In Example 5.1and Problem 5.5(b) we ignored spin (or, if you prefer, we assumed the particles are in the same spin state). (a)Do it now for particles of spin 1/2. Construct the four lowest-energy conﬁgura- tions, and specify their energies and degeneracies. Suggestion: Use the notation ψn1n2|sm/angbracketright, whereψn1n2is deﬁned in Example 5.1and|sm/angbracketrightin Section 4.4.3 .9 6To construct a completely symmetric conﬁguration, use the permanent (same as determinant, but without the minus signs). 7In the absence of coupling between spin and position, we are free to assume that the state is separable in its spin and spatial coordinates. This just says that the probability of getting spin up is independent of the location of the particle. In the presence of coupling, the general state would take the form of a linear combination: ψ+(r)χ++ψ−(r)χ−, as in Problem 4.64. 8I’ll letχ(1,2)stand for the combined spin state; in Dirac notation it is some linear combination of the states |s1s2m1m2/angbracketright. I assume that the state is again a simple product of a position state and a spin state; as you’ll see in Problem 5.10, this is not always true when three or more electrons are involved—even in the absence of coupling. 9Of course, spin requires three dimensions, whereas we ordinarily think of the inﬁnite square well as existing in one dimension. But it could represent a particle in three dimensions that is conﬁned to a one-dimensional wire.5.1 Two-Particle Systems 207 (b)Do the same for spin 1. Hint: First work out the spin-1 analogs to the spin-1/2 sin- glet and triplet conﬁgurations, using the Clebsch–Gordan coefﬁcients; note which of them are symmetric and which antisymmetric.10 5.1.4 Generalized Symmetrization Principle I have assumed, for the sake of simplicity, that the particles are noninteracting, the spin and position are decoupled (with the combined state a product of position and spin factors), and the potential is time-independent. But the fundamental symmetrization/antisymmetrization requirement for identical bosons/fermions is much more general. Let us deﬁne the exchange operator ,ˆP, which interchanges the two particles:11 ˆP|(1,2)/angbracketright=|(2,1)/angbracketright. (5.30) Clearly,ˆP2=1, and it follows (prove it for yourself) that the eigenvalues of ˆPare±1. Now, if the two particles are identical, the Hamiltonian must treat them the same: m1=m2and V(r1,r2,t)=V(r2,r1,t).I tf o l l o w st h a t ˆPandˆHare compatible observables, /bracketleftBig ˆP,ˆH/bracketrightBig =0, (5.31) and hence (Equation 3.73) d/angbracketleftBig ˆP/angbracketrightBig dt=0. (5.32) If the system starts out in an eigenstate of ˆP—symmetric/parenleftbig/angbracketleftbigˆP/angbracketrightbig =1/parenrightbig , or antisymmetric/parenleftbig/angbracketleftbigˆP/angbracketrightbig = −1/parenrightbig —then it will stay that way forever. The symmetrization axiom says that for identical particles the state is not merely allowed ,b u t required to satisfy |(1,2)/angbracketright=±|(2,1)/angbracketright, (5.33) with the plus sign for bosons, and the minus sign for fermions.12If you have nidentical parti- cles, of course, the state must be symmetric or antisymmetric under the interchange of any two : |(1,2,..., i,..., j,..., n)/angbracketright=±|(1,2,..., j,..., i,..., n)/angbracketright, (5.34) This is the general statement, of which Equation 5.17 is a special case. 10This problem was suggested by Greg Elliott. 11ˆPswitches the particles (1↔2); this means exchanging their positions, their spins, and any other properties they might possess. If you like, it switches the labels , 1 and 2. I claimed (in Chapter 1) that all our operators would involve multiplication or differentiation; that was a lie. The exchange operator is an exception—and for that matter so is the projection operator (Section 3.6.2 ). 12It is sometimes alleged that the symmetrization requirement (Equation 5.33)i sforced by the fact that ˆPand ˆHcommute. This is false: It is perfectly possible to imagine a system of two distinguishable particles (say, an electron and a positron) for which the Hamiltonian is symmetric, and yet there is no requirement that the state be symmetric (or antisymmetric). But identical particles have to occupy symmetric or antisymmetric states, and this is anew fundamental law —on a par, logically, with Schrödinger’s equation and the statistical interpretation. Of course, there didn’t have to be any such things as identical particles; it could have been that every single particle in the universe was distinguishable from every other one. Quantum mechanics allows for the possibility of identical particles, and nature (being lazy) seized the opportunity. (But don’t complain—this makes matters enormously simpler!)208 CHAPTER 5 Identical Particles ∗∗ Problem 5.10 Fortwospin-1/2 particles you can construct symmetric and antisymmet- ric states (the triplet and singlet combinations, respectively). For three spin-1/2 particles you can construct symmetric combinations (the quadruplet, in Problem 4.65), but no completely anti-symmetric conﬁguration is possible. (a)Prove it.Hint: The “bulldozer” method is to write down the most general linear combination: χ(1,2,3)=a|↑↑↑/angbracketright+ b|↑↑↓/angbracketright+ c|↑↓↑/angbracketright+ d|↑↓↓/angbracketright+ e|↓↑↑/angbracketright+ f|↓↑↓/angbracketright+ g|↓↓↑/angbracketright+ h|↓↓↓/angbracketright. What does antisymmetry under 1 ↔2 tell you about the coefﬁcients? (Note that the eight terms are mutually orthogonal.) Now invoke antisymmetry under 2 ↔3. (b)Suppose you put three identical noninteracting spin-1/2 particles in the inﬁnite square well. What is the ground state for this system, what is its energy, and what is its degeneracy? Note: You can’t put all three in the position state ψ1(why not?); you’ll need two in ψ1and the other in ψ2. But the symmetric conﬁguration [ψ1(x1)ψ1(x2)ψ2(x3)+ψ1(x1)ψ2(x2)ψ1(x3)+ψ2(x1)ψ1(x2)ψ1(x3)]is no good (because there’s no antisymmetric spin combination to go with it), and you can’t m a k eac o m p l e t e l ya n t i s y m m e t r i cc o m b i n a t i o no ft h o s et h r e et e r m s ....I nt h i sc a s e you simply cannot construct an antisymmetric product of a spatial state and a spin state. But you cando it with an appropriate linear combination of such products. Hint: Form the Slater determinant (Problem 5.8) whose top row is ψ1(x1)|↑/angbracketright1, ψ1(x1)|↓/angbracketright1,ψ2(x1)|↑/angbracketright1. (c)Show that your answer to part (b), properly normalized, can be written in the form /Phi1(1,2,3)=1√ 3[/Phi1(1,2)φ(3)−/Phi1(1,3)φ(2)+/Phi1(2,3)φ(1)] where/Phi1(i,j)is the wave function of two particles in the n=1 state and the singlet spin conﬁguration, /Phi1(i,j)=ψ1(xi)ψ1/parenleftbig xj/parenrightbig/vextendsingle/vextendsingle↑i↓j/angbracketrightbig −/vextendsingle/vextendsingle↓i↑j/angbracketrightbig √ 2, (5.35) andφ(i)is the wave function of the ith particle in the n=2s p i nu ps t a t e : φ(i)= ψ2(xi)|↑i/angbracketright.

For interacting particles this is no longer the case. A famous example is the Laughlin wave function ,13which is an approximation to the ground state of Nelectrons 13“Robert B. Laughlin—Nobel Lecture: Fractional Quantization.” Nobelprize.org.

(Spin is not at issue here; in the ground state all the electrons have spin down with respect to the direction of B, and that is a trivially symmetric conﬁguration.) (a)Show thatψhas the proper antisymmetry for fermions. (b)Forq=1,ψdescribes noninteracting particles (by which I mean that it can be written as a single Slater determinant—see Problem 5.8). This is true for any N, but check it explicitly for N=3. What single particle states are occupied in this case? (c)For values of qgreater than 1,ψcannot be written as a single Slater determinant, and describes interacting particles (in practice, Coulomb repulsion of the electrons). It can, however, be written as a sumof Slater determinants. Show that, for q=3 andN=2,ψcan be written as a sum of two Slater determinants. Comment : In the noninteracting case (b) we can describe the wave function as “three particles occupying the three single-particle states ψa,ψbandψc,” but in the interacting case (c), no corresponding statement can be made; in that case, the different Slater determinants that make up ψcorrespond to occupation of different sets of single-particle states. 5.2 ATOMS A neutral atom, of atomic number Z, consists of a heavy nucleus, with electric charge Ze, surrounded by Zelectrons (mass mand charge−e). The Hamiltonian for this system is14 ˆH=Z/summationdisplay j=1/braceleftbigg −/planckover2pi12 2m∇2 j−/parenleftbigg1 4π/epsilon10/parenrightbiggZe2 rj/bracerightbigg +1 2/parenleftbigg1 4π/epsilon10/parenrightbiggZ/summationdisplay j/negationslash=ke2 /vextendsingle/vextendsinglerj−rk/vextendsingle/vextendsingle. (5.36) The term in curly brackets represents the kinetic plus potential energy of the jth electron, in the electric ﬁeld of the nucleus; the second sum (which runs over all values of jandkexcept j=k) is the potential energy associated with the mutual repulsion of the electrons (the factor 14I’m assuming the nucleus is stationary . The trick of accounting for nuclear motion by using the reduced mass (Problem 5.1) works only for the two-body problem; fortunately, the nucleus is so much heavier than the electrons that the correction is extremely small even in the case of hydrogen (see Problem 5.2(a)), and it is smaller still for other atoms. There are more interesting effects, due to magnetic interactions associated with electron spin, relativistic corrections, and the ﬁnite size of the nucleus. We’ll look into these in later chapters, but all of them are minute corrections to the “purely coulombic” atom described by Equation 5.36.210 CHAPTER 5 Identical Particles of 1/2 in front corrects for the fact that the summation counts each pair twice). The problem is to solve Schrödinger’s equation, ˆHψ=Eψ, (5.37) for the wave function ψ(r1,r2,..., rZ).15 Unfortunately, the Schrödinger equation with Hamiltonian in Equation 5.36 cannot be solved exactly (at any rate, it hasn’t been), except for the very simplest case, Z=1 (hydro- gen). In practice, one must resort to elaborate approximation methods. Some of these we shall explore in Part II; for now I plan only to sketch some qualitative features of the solutions, obtained by neglecting the electron repulsion term altogether. In Section 5.2.1 we’ll study the ground state and excited states of helium, and in Section 5.2.2 we’ll examine the ground states of higher atoms. Problem 5.12 (a)Suppose you could ﬁnd a solution ψ(r1,r2,..., rZ)to the Schrödinger equation (Equation 5.37), for the Hamiltonian in Equation 5.36. Describe how you would construct from it a completely symmetric function, and a completely antisymmet- ric function, which also satisfy the Schrödinger equation, with the same energy. What happens to the completely antisymmetric function if ψ(r1,r2,..., rZ)is symmetric in (say) its ﬁrst two arguments (r1↔r2)? (b)By the same logic, show that a completely antisymmetric spin state for Zelectrons is impossible, if Z>2 (this generalizes Problem 5.10(a)). 5.2.1 Helium After hydrogen, the simplest atom is helium (Z=2). The Hamiltonian, ˆH=/braceleftbigg −/planckover2pi12 2m∇2 1−1 4π/epsilon102e2 r1/bracerightbigg +/braceleftbigg −/planckover2pi12 2m∇2 2−1 4π/epsilon102e2 r2/bracerightbigg +1 4π/epsilon10e2 |r1−r2|, (5.38) consists of two hydrogenic Hamiltonians (with nuclear charge 2 e), one for electron 1 and one for electron 2, together with a ﬁnal term describing the repulsion of the two electrons. It is this last term that causes all the trouble. If we simply ignore it, the Schrödinger equation separates, and the solutions can be written as products of hydrogen wave functions: ψ(r1,r2)=ψn/lscriptm(r1)ψn/prime/lscript/primem/prime(r2), (5.39) only with half the Bohr radius (Equation 4.72), and four times the Bohr energies (Equation 4.70)—if you don’t see why, refer back to Problem 4.19. The total energy would be E=4(En+En/prime), (5.40) where En=−13.6/n2eV . In particular, the ground state would be ψ0(r1,r2)=ψ100(r1)ψ100(r2)=8 πa3e−2(r1+r2)/a, (5.41) 15Because the Hamiltonian ( 5.36) makes no reference to spin, the product ψ(r1,r2,..., rZ)χ(s1,s2,..., sZ) still satisﬁes the Schrödinger equation. However, for Z>2 such product states cannot in general meet the (anti-)symmetrization requirement, and it is necessary to construct linear combinations, with permuted indices (see Problem 5.16). But that comes at the end of the story; for the moment we are only concerned with the spatial wave function.5.2 Atoms 211 (Equation 4.80), and its energy would be E0=8(−13.6e V)=−109 eV. (5.42) Becauseψ0is a symmetric function, the spin state has to be antisymmetric , so the ground state of helium should be a singlet conﬁguration, with the spins “oppositely aligned.” The actual ground state of helium is indeed a singlet, but the experimentally determined energy is−78.975 eV , so the agreement is not very good. But this is hardly surprising: We ignored electron–electron repulsion, which is certainly nota small contribution. It is clearly positive (see Equation 5.38), which is comforting—evidently it brings the total energy up from −109 to−79 eV (see Problem 5.15). The excited states of helium consist of one electron in the hydrogenic ground state, and the other in an excited state: ψn/lscriptmψ100. (5.43) (If you try to put both electrons in excited states, one immediately drops to the ground state, releasing enough energy to knock the other one into the continuum (E>0), leaving you with a helium ion(He+) and a free electron. This is an interesting system in its own right— see Problem 5.13—but it is not our present concern.) We can construct both symmetric and antisymmetric combinations, in the usual way (Equation 5.17); the former go with the antisym- metric spin conﬁguration (the singlet)—they are called parahelium —while the latter require a symmetric spin conﬁguration (the triplet)—they are known as orthohelium . The ground state is necessarily parahelium; the excited states come in both forms. Because the symmetric spatial state brings the electrons closer together (as we discovered in Section 5.1.2 ), we expect a higher interaction energy in parahelium, and indeed, it is experimentally conﬁrmed that the parahe- lium states have somewhat higher energy than their orthohelium counterparts (see Figure 5.1). Problem 5.13 (a)Suppose you put both electrons in a helium atom into the n=2 state; what would the energy of the emitted electron be? (Assume no photons are emitted in the process.) (b)Describe (quantitatively) the spectrum of the helium ion, He+. That is, state the “Rydberg-like” formula for the emitted wavelengths. Problem 5.14 Discuss (qualitatively) the energy level scheme for helium if (a) electrons were identical bosons, and (b) if electrons were distinguishable particles (but with the same mass and charge). Pretend these “electrons” still have spin 1/2, so the spin conﬁgurations are the singlet and the triplet. ∗∗ Problem 5.15 (a)Calculate/angbracketleft(1/|r1−r2|)/angbracketrightfor the stateψ0(Equation 5.41).Hint:D ot h e d3r2 integral ﬁrst, using spherical coordinates, and setting the polar axis along r1,s o that |r1−r2|=/radicalBig r2 1+r2 2−2r1r2cosθ2.

(Of course, we’re still working with an approximate wave function, so don’t expect perfect agreement.) Problem 5.16 The ground state of lithium. Ignoring electron–electron repulsion, con- struct the ground state of lithium (Z=3). Start with a spatial wave function, analogous to Equation 5.41, but remember that only two electrons can occupy the hydrogenic ground state; the third goes to ψ200.16What is the energy of this state? Now tack on the spin, and antisymmetrize (if you get stuck, refer back to Problem 5.10). What’s the degeneracy of the ground state? 16Actually,/lscript=1 would do just as well, but electron–electron repulsion favors /lscript=0, as we shall see.5.2 Atoms 213 5.2.2 The Periodic Table The ground state electron conﬁgurations for heavier atoms can be pieced together in much the same way. To ﬁrst approximation (ignoring their mutual repulsion altogether) the individ- ual electrons occupy one-particle hydrogenic states (n,/lscript,m), called orbitals , in the Coulomb potential of a nucleus with charge Ze. If electrons were bosons (or distinguishable particles) they would all shake down to the ground state (1,0,0), and chemistry would be very dull indeed. But electrons are in fact identical fermions, subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, so only twocan occupy any given orbital (one with spin up, and one with spin down—or, more precisely, in the singlet conﬁguration). There are n2hydrogenic wave functions (all with the same energy En) for a given value of n,s ot h e n=1shell has room for two electrons, the n=2 shell holds eight, n=3 takes 18, and in general the nth shell can accommodate 2 n2 electrons. Qualitatively, the horizonal rows on the Periodic Table correspond to ﬁlling out each shell (if this were the whole story, they would have lengths 2, 8, 18, 32, 50, etc., instead of 2, 8, 8, 18, 18, etc.; we’ll see in a moment how the electron–electron repulsion throws the counting off). With helium, the n=1 shell is ﬁlled, so the next atom, lithium (Z=3), has to put one electron into the n=2 shell. Now, for n=2 we can have/lscript=0o r/lscript=1; which of these will the third electron choose? In the absence of electron–electron interactions, they have the same energy (the Bohr energies depend on n, remember, but not on /lscript). But the effect of electron repulsion is to favor the lowest value of /lscript, for the following reason. Angular momentum tends to throw the electron outward, and the farther out it gets, the more effectively the inner electrons screen the nucleus (roughly speaking, the innermost electron “sees” the full nuclear charge Ze, but the outermost electron sees an effective charge hardly greater than e). Within a given shell, therefore, the state with lowest energy (which is to say, the most tightly bound electron) is /lscript=0, and the energy increases with increasing /lscript. Thus the third electron in lithium occupies the orbital (2,0,0).17The next atom (beryllium, with Z=4) also ﬁts into this state (only with “opposite spin”), but boron (Z=5)has to make use of /lscript=1. Continuing in this way, we reach neon (Z=10), at which point the n=2 shell is ﬁlled, and we advance to the next row of the periodic table and begin to populate the n=3 shell. First there are two atoms (sodium and magnesium) with /lscript=0, and then there are six with /lscript=1 (aluminum through argon). Following argon there “should” be 10 atoms with n=3 and/lscript=2; however, by this time the screening effect is so strong that it overlaps the next shell; potassium (Z=19)and calcium(Z=20)choose n=4,/lscript=0, in preference to n=3,/lscript=2. After that we drop back to pick up the n=3,/lscript=2 stragglers (scandium through zinc), followed by n=4,/lscript=1 (gallium through krypton), at which point we again make a premature jump to the next row(n=5), and wait until later to slip in the /lscript=2 and/lscript=3 orbitals from the n=4 shell. For details of this intricate counterpoint I refer you to any book on atomic physics.18 I would be delinquent if I failed to mention the archaic nomenclature for atomic states, because all chemists and most physicists use it (and the people who make up the Graduate Record Exam love this sort of thing). For reasons known best to nineteenth-century spectro- scopists,/lscript=0 is called s(for “sharp”),/lscript=1i sp(for “principal”), /lscript=2i sd(“diffuse”), and/lscript=3i s f(“fundamental”); after that I guess they ran out of imagination, because it now 17This standard argument has been called into question by W. Stacey and F. Marsiglio, EPL,100, 43002 (2012). 18See, for example, Ugo Fano and L. Fano, Basic Physics of Atoms and Molecules , Wiley, New York (1959), Chapter 18, or the classic by Gerhard Herzberg, Atomic Spectra and Atomic Structure , Dover, New York (1944).214 CHAPTER 5 Identical Particles continues alphabetically ( g,h,i,s k i p j, just to be utterly perverse, k,l, etc.).19The state of a particular electron is represented by the pair n/lscript, with n(the number) giving the shell, and /lscript(the letter) specifying the orbital angular momentum; the magnetic quantum number mis not listed, but an exponent is used to indicate the number of electrons that occupy the state in question. Thus the conﬁguration (1s)2(2s)2(2p)2(5.44) tells us that there are two electrons in the orbital (1,0,0), two in the orbital (2,0,0), and two in some combination of the orbitals (2,1,1), (2,1,0), and (2,1, −1). This happens to be the ground state of carbon. In that example there are two electrons with orbital angular momentum quantum number 1, so the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, L(capital L—not to be confused with theLdenoting n=2—instead of/lscript, to indicate that this pertains to the total, not to any one particle) could be 2, 1, or 0. Meanwhile, the two (1s)electrons are locked together in the singlet state, with total spin zero, and so are the two (2s)electrons, but the two (2p)electrons could be in the singlet conﬁguration or the triplet conﬁguration. So the total spin quantum number S(capital, again, because it’s the total) could be 1 or 0. Evidently the grand total (orbital plus spin), J, could be 3, 2, 1, or 0 (Equation 4.182 ). There exist rituals, known as Hund’s Rules (see Problem 5.18) for ﬁguring out what these totals will be, for a particular atom. The result is recorded as the following hieroglyphic: 2S+1LJ, (5.45) (where SandJare the numbers, and Lthe letter—capitalized, because we’re talking about the totals ). The ground state of carbon happens to be3P0: the total spin is 1 (hence the 3), the total orbital angular momentum is 1 (hence the P), and the grand total angular momentum is zero (hence the 0). In Table 5.1the individual conﬁgurations and the total angular momenta (in the notation of Equation 5.45) are listed, for the ﬁrst four rows of the Periodic Table.20 ∗ Problem 5.17 (a)Figure out the electron conﬁgurations (in the notation of Equation 5.44)f o rt h eﬁ r s t two rows of the Periodic Table (up to neon), and check your results against Table 5.1.

What are the total spin, total orbital, and grand total angular momentum quantum numbers? Suggest a likely electron conﬁguration for dysprosium. 5.3 SOLIDS In the solid state, a few of the loosely-bound outermost valence electrons in each atom become detached, and roam around throughout the material, no longer subject only to the Coulomb ﬁeld of a speciﬁc “parent” nucleus, but rather to the combined potential of the entire crystal lattice. In this section we will examine two extremely primitive models: ﬁrst, the “electron gas” theory of Sommerfeld, which ignores allforces (except the conﬁning boundaries), treating the wandering electrons as free particles in a box (the three-dimensional analog to an inﬁnite square well); and second, Bloch’s theory, which introduces a periodic potential representing the electrical attraction of the regularly spaced, positively charged, nuclei (but still ignores electron–electron repulsion). These models are no more than the ﬁrst halting steps toward a quantum theory of solids, but already they reveal the critical role of the Pauli exclusion principle in accounting for “solidity,” and provide illuminating insight into the remarkable electrical properties of conductors, semi-conductors, and insulators. 5.3.1 The Free Electron Gas Suppose the object in question is a rectangular solid, with dimensions lx,ly,lz, and imagine that an electron inside experiences no forces at all, except at the impenetrable walls: V(x,y,z)=/braceleftBigg 0,0<x<lx,0<y<ly,0<z<lz; ∞,otherwise.(5.46) The Schrödinger equation, −/planckover2pi12 2m∇2ψ=Eψ, separates, in Cartesian coordinates: ψ(x,y,z)=X(x)Y(y)Z(z), with −/planckover2pi12 2md2X dx2=ExX,−/planckover2pi12 2md2Y dy2=EyY,−/planckover2pi12 2md2Z dz2=EzZ, andE=Ex+Ey+Ez.

The shaded volume is one “block,” and there is one state (potentially two electrons) for every block.218 CHAPTER 5 Identical Particles of “k-space,” where V≡lxlylzis the volume of the object itself. Suppose our sample contains Natoms, and each atom contributes dfree electrons. (In practice, Nwill be enormous—on the order of Avogadro’s number, for an object of macroscopic size—whereas dis a small number—1, 2, or 3, typically.) If electrons were bosons (or distinguishable particles), they would all settle down to the ground state, ψ111.21But electrons are in fact identical fermions , subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, so only two of them can occupy any given state. They will ﬁll up one octant of a sphere ink-space,22whose radius, kF, is determined by the fact that each pair of electrons requires a volume π3/V(Equation 5.51): 1 8/parenleftbigg4 3πk3 F/parenrightbigg =Nd 2/parenleftbiggπ3 V/parenrightbigg . Thus kF=/parenleftBig 3ρπ2/parenrightBig1/3 , (5.52) where ρ≡Nd V(5.53) is the free electron density (the number of free electrons per unit volume). The boundary separating occupied and unoccupied states, in k-space, is called the Fermi surface (hence the subscript F). The corresponding energy is the Fermi energy ,EF; for a free electron gas, EF=/planckover2pi12 2m/parenleftBig 3ρπ2/parenrightBig2/3 . (5.54) The total energy of the electron gas can be calculated as follows: A shell of thickness dk (Figure 5.3) contains a volume kxkkz kydk Figure 5.3: One octant of a spherical shell in k-space. 21I’m assuming there is no appreciable thermal excitation, or other disturbance, to lift the solid out of its collective ground state. If you like, I’m talking about a “cold” solid, though (as you will see in Problem 5.21(c)), typical solids are still “cold,” in this sense, far above room temperature. 22Because Nis such a huge number, we need not worry about the distinction between the actual jagged edge of the grid and the smooth spherical surface that approximates it.5.3 Solids 219 1 8/parenleftBig 4πk2/parenrightBig dk, so the number of electron states in the shell is 2/bracketleftbig (1/2)πk2dk/bracketrightbig /parenleftbig π3/V/parenrightbig=V π2k2dk. Each of these states carries an energy /planckover2pi12k2/2m(Equation 5.50), so the energy of the electrons in the shell is dE=/planckover2pi12k2 2mV π2k2dk, (5.55) and hence the total energy of all the ﬁlled states is Etot=/planckover2pi12V 2π2m/integraldisplaykF 0k4dk=/planckover2pi12k5 FV 10π2m=/planckover2pi12/parenleftbig 3π2Nd/parenrightbig5/3 10π2mV−2/3. (5.56) This quantum mechanical energy plays a role rather analogous to the internal thermal energy (U)of an ordinary gas. In particular, it exerts a pressure on the walls, for if the box expands by an amount dV, the total energy decreases: dEtot=−2 3/planckover2pi12/parenleftbig 3π2Nd/parenrightbig5/3 10π2mV−5/3dV=−2 3EtotdV V, and this shows up as work done on the outside (dW=Pd V)by the quantum pressure P. Evidently P=2 3Etot V=2 3/planckover2pi12k5 F 10π2m=/parenleftbig 3π2/parenrightbig2/3/planckover2pi12 5mρ5/3. (5.57) Here, then, is a partial answer to the question of why a cold solid object doesn’t simply col- lapse : There is a stabilizing internal pressure, having nothing to do with electron–electron repulsion (which we have ignored) or thermal motion (which we have excluded), but is strictly quantum mechanical, and derives ultimately from the antisymmetrization requirement for the wave functions of identical fermions. It is sometimes called degeneracy pressure , though “exclusion pressure” might be a better term.23 Problem 5.20 Find the average energy per free electron (Etot/Nd),a saf r a c t i o no ft h e Fermi energy.

(c)At what temperature would the characteristic thermal energy ( kBT, where kBis the Boltzmann constant and Tis the Kelvin temperature) equal the Fermi energy, for copper?

As long as the actual temperature is substantially below the Fermi temperature, the material can be 23Wederived Equations 5.52,5.54,5.56,a n d 5.57 for the special case of an inﬁnite rectangular well, but they hold for containers of any shape, as long as the number of particles is extremely large.220 CHAPTER 5 Identical Particles regarded as “cold,” with most of the electrons in the lowest accessible state. Since the melting point of copper is 1356 K, solid copper is always cold. (d)Calculate the degeneracy pressure (Equation 5.57) of copper, in the electron gas model. Problem 5.22 Helium-3 is fermion with spin 1 /2 (unlike the more common isotope helium- 4 which is a boson). At low temperatures (T/lessmuchTF), helium-3 can be treated as a Fermi gas (Section 5.3.1 ). Given a density of 82 kg/m3, calculate TF(Problem 5.21(c)) for helium-3. Problem 5.23 Thebulk modulus of a substance is the ratio of a small decrease in pressure to the resulting fractional increase in volume: B=−VdP dV. Show that B=(5/3)P, in the free electron gas model, and use your result in Problem 5.21(d) to estimate the bulk modulus of copper. Comment : The observed value is 13 .4× 1010N/m2, but don’t expect perfect agreement—after all, we’re neglecting all electron– nucleus and electron–electron forces! Actually, it is rather surprising that this calculation comes as close as it does. 5.3.2 Band Structure We’re now going to improve on the free electron model, by including the forces exerted on the electrons by the regularly spaced, positively charged, essentially stationary nuclei. The qualitative behavior of solids is dictated to a remarkable degree by the mere fact that this potential is periodic —its actual shape is relevant only to the ﬁner details. To show you how it goes, I’m going to develop the simplest possible model: a one-dimensional Dirac comb , consisting of evenly spaced delta-function spikes (Figure 5.4).24But ﬁrst I need to introduce a powerful theorem that vastly simpliﬁes the analysis of periodic potentials. A periodic potential is one that repeats itself after some ﬁxed distance a: V(x+a)=V(x). (5.58) Bloch’s theorem tells us that for such a potential the solutions to the Schrödinger equation, −/planckover2pi12 2md2ψ dx2+V(x)ψ=Eψ, (5.59) can be taken to satisfy the condition ψ(x+a)=eiqaψ(x), (5.60) 24It would be more natural to let the delta functions go down , so as to represent the attractive force of the nuclei. But then there would be negative energy solutions as well as positive energy solutions, and that makes the calculations more cumbersome (see Problem 5.26). Since all we’re trying to do here is explore the consequences of periodicity, it is simpler to adopt this less plausible shape; if it comforts you, think of the nuclei as residing at ±a/2,±3a/2, ±5a/2 ,....5.3 Solids 221 for some constant q(by “constant” I mean that it is independent of x; it may well depend on E).25In a moment we will discover that qis in fact real, so althoughψ(x)itself is not periodic, |ψ(x)|2is: |ψ(x+a)|2=|ψ(x)|2, (5.61) as one would certainly expect.26 Of course, no realsolid goes on forever, and the edges are going to spoil the periodicity of V(x), and render Bloch’s theorem inapplicable. However, for any macroscopic crystal, con- taining something on the order of Avogadro’s number of atoms, it is hardly imaginable that edge effects can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the behavior of electrons deep inside. This suggests the following device to salvage Bloch’s theorem: We wrap the xaxis around in a circle, and connect it onto its tail, after a large number N≈1023of periods; formally, we impose the boundary condition ψ(x+Na)=ψ(x). (5.62) It follows (from Equation 5.60) that eiNqaψ(x)=ψ(x), soeiNqa=1, or Nqa=2πn, and hence q=2πn Na,(n=0,±1,±2,...). (5.63) In particular, qis necessarily real. The virtue of Bloch’s theorem is that we need only solve the Schrödinger equation within a single cell (say, on the interval 0 ≤x<a); recursive application of Equation 5.60 generates the solution everywhere else. Now, suppose the potential consists of a long string of delta-function spikes (the Dirac comb): V(x)=αN−1/summationdisplay j=0δ(x−ja). (5.64) (In Figure 5.4you must imagine that the xaxis has been “wrapped around”, so the Nth spike actually appears at x=−a.) No one would pretend that this is a realistic model, but remember, it is only the effect of periodicity that concerns us here; the classic Kronig–Penney model27 a −aV(x) x−2a 2a 3a 4a 5a 6a 0 Figure 5.4: The Dirac comb, Equation 5.64. 25The proof of Bloch’s theorem will come in Chapter 6(see Section 6.2.2 ). 26Indeed, you might be tempted to reverse the argument, starting with Equation 5.61, as a way of proving Bloch’s theorem. It doesn’t work, for Equation 5.61 alone would allow the phase factor in Equation 5.60 to be a function of x. 27R. de L. Kronig and W. G. Penney, Proc. R. Soc. Lond., ser. A, 130, 499 (1930).222 CHAPTER 5 Identical Particles used a repeating rectangular pattern, and many authors still prefer that one.28In the region 0<x<athe potential is zero, so −/planckover2pi12 2md2ψ dx2=Eψ, or d2ψ dx2=−k2ψ, where k≡√ 2mE /planckover2pi1, (5.65) as usual. The general solution is ψ(x)=Asin(kx)+Bcos(kx),(0<x<a). (5.66) According to Bloch’s theorem, the wave function in the cell immediately to the leftof the origin is ψ(x)=e−iqa{Asin[k(x+a)]+Bcos[k(x+a)]},(−a<x<0). (5.67) Atx=0,ψmust be continuous, so B=e−iqa[Asin(ka)+Bcos(ka)]; (5.68) its derivative suffers a discontinuity proportional to the strength of the delta function (Equation 2.128 , with the sign of αswitched, since these are spikes instead of wells): kA−e−iqak[Acos(ka)−Bsin(ka)]=2mα /planckover2pi12B. (5.69) Solving Equation 5.68 forAsin(ka)yields Asin(ka)=/bracketleftBig eiqa−cos(ka)/bracketrightBig B. (5.70) Substituting this into Equation 5.69, and cancelling kB, we ﬁnd /bracketleftBig eiqa−cos(ka)/bracketrightBig/bracketleftBig 1−e−iqacos(ka)/bracketrightBig +e−iqasin2(ka)=2mα /planckover2pi12ksin(ka), which simpliﬁes to cos(qa)=cos(ka)+mα /planckover2pi12ksin(ka). (5.71) This is the fundamental result, from which all else follows.29 Equation 5.71 determines the possible values of k, and hence the allowed energies. To simplify the notation, let z≡ka,andβ≡mαa /planckover2pi12, (5.72) so the right side of Equation 5.71 can be written as f(z)≡cos(z)+βsin(z) z. (5.73) 28See, for instance, David Park, Introduction to the Quantum Theory , 3nd edn, McGraw-Hill, New York (1992). 29For the Kronig–Penney potential (footnote 27,p a g e 221), the formula is more complicated, but it shares the qualitative features we are about to explore.5.3 Solids 223 0 2π 4π 3π1 0f(z)z –1 π Figure 5.5: Graph of f(z)(Equation 5.73)f o rβ=10, showing allowed bands separated by forbidden gaps. The constantβis a dimensionless measure of the “strength” of the delta function. In Figure 5.5I have plotted f(z), for the caseβ=10. The important thing to notice is that f(z)strays outside the range (−1,+1), and in such regions there is no hope of solving Equation 5.71, since|cos(qa)|, of course, cannot be greater than 1. These gaps represent forbidden energies; they are separated by bands ofallowed energies. Within a given band, virtually any energy is allowed, since according to Equation 5.63,qa=2πn/N, where Nis a huge number, and ncan be any integer. You might imagine drawing Nhorizontal lines on Figure 5.5, at values of cos(2πn/N)ranging from +1 (n=0)down to−1(n=N/2), and back almost to +1 (n=N−1)—at this point the Bloch factor eiqarecycles, so no new solutions are generated by further increasing n. The intersection of each of these lines with f(z)yields an allowed energy. Evidently there are Nstates in each band, so closely spaced that for most purposes we can regard them as forming a continuum (Figure 5.6). So far, we’ve only put oneelectron in our potential. In practice there will be Ndof them, where dis again the number of “free” electrons per atom. Because of the Pauli exclusion principle, only two electrons can occupy a given spatial state, so if d=1, they will half ﬁll the ﬁrst band, if d=2 they will completely ﬁll the ﬁrst band, if d=3 they half ﬁll the second band, and so on. (In three dimensions, and with more realistic potentials, the band structure may be more complicated, but the existence of allowed bands, separated by forbidden gaps, persists—band structure is the signature of a periodic potential.30) Now, if the topmost band is only partly ﬁlled, it takes very little energy to excite an electron to the next allowed level, and such a material will be a conductor (ametal ). On the other hand, if the top band is completely ﬁlled, it takes a relatively large energy to excite an electron, since it has to jump across the forbidden zone. Such materials are typically insulators , though if the gap is rather narrow, and the temperature sufﬁciently high, then random thermal energy can knock an electron over the hump, and the material is a semiconductor (silicon and germanium are examples).31In the free electron model allsolids should be metals, since there are no 30Regardless of dimension, if dis an odd integer you are guaranteed to have partially-ﬁlled bands and you would expect metallic behavior. If dis an even integer, it depends on the speciﬁc band structure whether there will be partially-ﬁlled bands or not. Interestingly, some materials, called Mott insulators , are nonconductors even though dis odd. In that case it is the interactions between electrons that leads to the insulating behavior, not the presence of gaps in the single-particle energy spectrum. 31Semiconductors typically have band gaps of 4 eV or less, small enough that thermal excitation at room temperature (kBT≈0.025 eV) produces perceptible conductivity. The conductivity of a semiconductor can be controlled by224 CHAPTER 5 Identical Particles bandE band bandgap gap Figure 5.6: The allowed energies for a periodic potential form essentially continuous bands. large gaps in the spectrum of allowed energies. It takes the band theory to account for the extraordinary range of electrical conductivities exhibited by the solids in nature. Problem 5.24 (a)Using Equations 5.66 and5.70, show that the wave function for a particle in the periodic delta function potential can be written in the form ψ(x)=C/braceleftBig sin(kx)+e−iqasin[k(a−x)]/bracerightBig ,(0≤x≤a). (Don’t bother to determine the normalization constant C.) (b)At the top of a band, where z=jπ, (a) yieldsψ(x)=0/0 (indeterminate). Find the correct wave function for this case. Note what happens to ψat each delta function. Problem 5.25 Find the energy at the bottom of the ﬁrst allowed band, for the case β=10, correct to three signiﬁcant digits. For the sake of argument, assume α/a=1e V . doping : including a few atoms of larger or smaller d; this puts some “extra” electrons into the next higher band, or creates some holes in the previously ﬁlled one, allowing in either case for weak electric currents to ﬂow.Further Problems on Chapter 5 225 ∗∗ Problem 5.26 Suppose we use delta function wells , instead of spikes (i.e. switch the sign of αin Equation 5.64). Analyze this case, constructing the analog to Figure 5.5. This requires no new calculation, for the positive energy solutions (except that βis now negative; use β=− 1.5 for the graph), but you doneed to work out the negative energy solutions (let κ≡√ −2mE//planckover2pi1andz≡−κa,f o r E<0); your graph will now extend to negative z). How many states are there in the ﬁrst allowed band? Problem 5.27 Show that most of the energies determined by Equation 5.71 are doubly degenerate. What are the exceptional cases?

On other platforms the plot can be obtained as follows: •Choose a large number (say 30,000) of equally-spaced values for the energy in the range E=0 and E=30. •For each value of E, compute the right-hand side of Equation 5.71. If the result is between−1 and 1, solve for qfrom Equation 5.71 and record the pair of values {q,E} and{-q,E} (there are two solutions for each energy). You will then have a list of pairs {{q1,E1},{q2,E2},...} which you can plot. FURTHER PROBLEMS ON CHAPTER 5 Problem 5.29 Suppose you have three particles, and three distinct one-particle states (ψa(x),ψb(x), andψc(x)) are available. How many different three-particle states can be constructed (a) if they are distinguishable particles, (b) if they are iden- tical bosons, (c) if they are identical fermions? (The particles need not be in different states—ψa(x1)ψa(x2)ψa(x3)would be one possibility, if the particles are distinguishable.)

The energy is a minimum for M=0, so the ground state will have zero magnetization. However, if the gas is placed in a magnetic ﬁeld (or in the pres- ence of interactions between the particles) it may be energetically favorable for the gas to magnetize. This is explored in Problems 5.33 and5.34. Problem 5.33 Pauli paramagnetism . If the free electron gas (Section 5.3.1 ) is placed in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B=Bˆk, the energies of the spin-up and spin-down states will be different:32 E± nxnynz=/planckover2pi12π2 2m/parenleftBigg n2 x l2x+n2 y l2y+n2 z l2z/parenrightBigg ±μBB. There will be more spin-down states occupied than spin-up states (since they are lower in energy), and consequently the system will acquire a magnetization (see Problem 5.32). (a)In the approximation that M/μB/lessmuchρ, ﬁnd the magnetization that minimizes the total energy. Hint: Use the result of Problem 5.32(b). (b)Themagnetic susceptibility is33 χ=μ0dM dB.

The explanation for this discrepancy lies in what has been left out of our model. In addition to theFurther Problems on Chapter 5 227 Problem 5.34 The Stoner criterion . The free-electron gas model (Section 5.3.1 ) ignores the Coulomb repulsion between electrons. Because of the exchange force (Sec- tion5.1.2 ), Coulomb repulsion has a stronger effect on two electrons with antiparallel spins (which behave in a way like distinguishable particles) than two electrons with parallel spins (whose position wave function must be antisymmetric). As a crude way to take account of Coulomb repulsion, pretend that every pair of electrons with oppo- site spin carries extra energy U, while electrons with the same spin do not interact at all; this adds /Delta1E=UN+N−to the total energy of the electron gas. As you will show, above a critical value of U, it becomes energetically favorable for the gas to spontaneously magnetize (N+/negationslash=N−); the material becomes ferromagnetic. (a)Rewrite/Delta1Ein terms of the density ρand the magnetization M(Equation 5.74). (b)Assuming that M/μB/lessmuchρ, for what minimum value of Uis a non-zero magnetization energetically favored? Hint: Use the result of Problem 5.32(b). ∗∗∗ Problem 5.35 Certain cold stars (called white dwarfs ) are stabilized against gravitational collapse by the degeneracy pressure of their electrons (Equation 5.57). Assuming constant density, the radius Rof such an object can be calculated as follows: (a)Write the total electron energy (Equation 5.56) in terms of the radius, the number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) N, the number of electrons per nucleon d, and the mass of the electron m.Beware: In this problem we are recycling the letters N anddfor a slightly different purpose than in the text. (b)Look up, or calculate, the gravitational energy of a uniformly dense sphere. Express your answer in terms of G(the constant of universal gravitation), R,N, andM(the mass of a nucleon). Note that the gravitational energy is negative . (c)Find the radius for which the total energy, (a) plus (b), is a minimum. Answer: R=/parenleftbigg9π 4/parenrightbigg2/3/planckover2pi12d5/3 GmM2N1/3. (Note that the radius decreases as the total mass increases! ) Put in the actual numbers, for everything except N,u s i n g d=1/2 (actually, ddecreases a bit as the atomic number increases, but this is close enough for our purposes). Answer: R=7.6×1025N−1/3m. (d)Determine the radius, in kilometers, of a white dwarf with the mass of the sun. (e)Determine the Fermi energy, in electron volts, for the white dwarf in (d), and compare it with the rest energy of an electron. Note that this system is getting dangerously relativistic (see Problem 5.36). paramagnetic coupling of the spin magnetic moment to an applied ﬁeld there is a coupling of the orbital magnetic moment to an applied ﬁeld and this has both paramagnetic and diamagnetic contributions (see Problem 4.72). In addition, the free electron gas model ignores the tightly-bound core electrons and these also couple to the magnetic ﬁeld. In the case of copper, it is the diamagnetic coupling of the core electrons that dominates.228 CHAPTER 5 Identical Particles ∗∗∗ Problem 5.36 We can extend the theory of a free electron gas (Section 5.3.1 )t ot h er e l - ativistic domain by replacing the classical kinetic energy, E=p2/2m, with the relativistic formula, E=/radicalbig p2c2+m2c4−mc2. Momentum is related to the wave vector in the usual way: p=/planckover2pi1k. In particular, in the extreme relativistic limit, E≈pc=/planckover2pi1ck. (a)Replace /planckover2pi12k2/2min Equation 5.55 by the ultra-relativistic expression, /planckover2pi1ck, and calculate Etotin this regime. (b)Repeat parts (a) and (b) of Problem 5.35 for the ultra-relativistic electron gas. Notice that in this case there is nostable minimum, regardless of R; if the total energy is positive, degeneracy forces exceed gravitational forces, and the star will expand, whereas if the total is negative, gravitational forces win out, and the star will collapse. Find the critical number of nucleons, Nc, such that gravitational collapse occurs for N>Nc. This is called the Chandrasekhar limit .Answer: 2.04×1057. What is the corresponding stellar mass (give your answer as a mul- tiple of the sun’s mass). Stars heavier than this will not form white dwarfs, but collapse further, becoming (if conditions are right) neutron stars . (c)At extremely high density, inverse beta decay ,e−+p+→n+ν, converts virtually all of the protons and electrons into neutrons (liberating neutrinos, which carry off energy, in the process). Eventually neutron degeneracy pressure stabilizes the collapse, just as electron degeneracy does for the white dwarf (see Problem 5.35). Calculate the radius of a neutron star with the mass of the sun. Also calculate the (neutron) Fermi energy, and compare it to the rest energy of a neutron. Is it reasonable to treat a neutron star nonrelativistically? Problem 5.37 An important quantity in many calculations is the density of states G(E): G(E)dE≡number of states with energy between EandE+dE. For a one-dimensional band structure, G(E)dE=2/parenleftbiggdq 2π/Na/parenrightbigg , where dq/(2π/Na)counts the number of states in the range dq(see Equation 5.63), and the factor of 2 accounts for the fact that states with qand−qhave the same energy.

Wildöer et al., Nature ,391, 59 (1998). 36If you are familiar with the classical problem of coupled oscillators, these ladder operators are straightforward to construct. Start with the normal mode coordinates you would use to decouple the classical problem, namely qk=1√ NN/summationdisplay j=1e−i2πjk/Nxj. The frequencies ωkare the classical normal mode frequencies, and you simply create a pair of ladder operators for each normal mode, by analogy with the single-particle case (Equation 2.48).230 CHAPTER 5 Identical Particles (c)Using Equation 5.75, show that xj=R+1√ NN−1/summationdisplay k=1/radicalBigg /planckover2pi1 2mωk/parenleftbig ˆak−+ˆaN−k+/parenrightbig ei2πjk/N ∂ ∂xj=1 N∂ ∂R+1√ NN−1/summationdisplay k=1/radicalbiggmωk 2/planckover2pi1/parenleftbig ˆak−−ˆaN−k+/parenrightbig ei2πjk/N where R=/summationtext jxj/Nis the center of mass coordinate.

Comment : Written in this form above, the Hamiltonian describes N−1 independent oscillators with frequencies ωk(as well as a center of mass that moves as a free particle of mass Nm). We can immediately write down the allowed energies: E=−/planckover2pi12K2 2(Nm)+N−1/summationdisplay k=1/planckover2pi1ωk/parenleftbigg nk+1 2/parenrightbigg where /planckover2pi1Kis the momentum of the center of mass and nk=0,1,...is the energy level of the kth mode of vibration. It is conventional to call nkthenumber of phonons in thekth mode. Phonons are the quanta of sound (atomic vibrations), just as photons are the quanta of light. The ladder operators ak+andak−are called phonon creation and annihilation operators since they increase or decrease the number of phonons in the kth mode. Problem 5.39 In Section 5.3.1 we put the electrons in a box with impenetrable walls. The same results can be obtained using periodic boundary conditions . We still imagine the electrons to be conﬁned to a box with sides of length lx,ly, and lzbut instead of requiring the wave function to vanish on each wall, we require it to take the same value on opposite walls: ψ(x,y,z)=ψ(x+lx,y,z)=ψ/parenleftbig x,y+ly,z/parenrightbig =ψ(x,y,z+lz). In this case we can represent the wave functions as traveling waves, ψ=1/radicalbiglxlylzeik·r=1/radicalbiglxlylzei(kxx+kyy+kzz), rather than as standing waves (Equation 5.49). Periodic boundary conditions—while certainly not physical—are often easier to work with (to describe something like elec- trical current a basis of traveling waves is more natural than a basis of standing waves) and if you are computing bulk properties of a material it shouldn’t matter which you use.Further Problems on Chapter 5 231 (a)Show that with periodic boundary conditions the wave vector satisﬁes kxlx=2nxπ, kyly=2nyπ, kzlz=2nzπ, where each nis an integer ( notnecessarily positive).

These same conservation laws hold in quantum mechanics; in both contexts they are the result of symmetries. In this chapter we will explain what a symmetry is and what it means for something to be conserved in quantum mechanics—and show how the two are related. Along the way we’ll investigate two related properties of quan- tum systems—energy level degeneracy and the selection rules that distinguish allowed from “forbidden” transitions. What is a symmetry? It is some transformation that leaves the system unchanged. As an example consider rotating a square piece of paper, as shown in Figure 6.1. If you rotate it by 30◦about an axis through its center it will be in a different orientation than the one it started in, but if you rotate it by 90◦it will resume its original orientation; you wouldn’t even know it had been rotated unless (say) you wrote numbers on the corners (in which case they would be permuted). A square therefore has a discrete rotational symmetry: a rotation by nπ/2f o r any integer nleaves it unchanged.1If you repeated this experiment with a circular piece of paper, a rotation by anyangle would leave it unchanged; the circle has continuous rotational symmetry. We will see that both discrete and continuous symmetries are important in quantum mechanics. Now imagine that the shapes in Figure 6.1refer not to pieces of paper, but to the boundaries of a two-dimensional inﬁnite square well. In that case the potential energy would have the same rotational symmetries as the piece of paper and (because the kinetic energy is unchanged by a rotation) the Hamiltonian would also be invariant. In quantum mechanics, when we say that a system has a symmetry, this is what we mean: that the Hamiltonian is unchanged by some transformation, such as a rotation or a translation. 6.1.1 Transformations in Space In this section, we introduce the quantum mechanical operators that implement translations, inversions, and rotations. We deﬁne each of these operators by how it acts on an arbitrary function. The translation operator takes a function and shifts it a distance a. The operator that accomplishes this is deﬁned by the relation 1A square of course has other symmetries as well, namely mirror symmetries about axes along a diagonal or bisecting two sides. The set of all transformations that leave the square unchanged is called D4, the “dihedral group” of degree 4.6.1 Introduction 233 απ 2 Figure 6.1: A square has a discrete rotational symmetry; it is unchanged when rotated by π/2 or multiples thereof. A circle has continuous rotational symmetry; it is unchanged when rotated by any angle α. ψ (x) ψ ′(x) x–ax Figure 6.2: A wave function ψ(x)and the translated wave function ψ/prime(x)=ˆT(a)ψ(x). Note that the value ofψ/primeatxis equal to the value of ψatx−a. ˆT(a)ψ(x)=ψ/prime(x)=ψ(x−a). (6.1) The sign can be confusing at ﬁrst; this equation says that the translated function ψ/primeatxis equal to the untranslated function ψatx−a(Figure 6.2)—the function itself has been shifted to the right by an amount a. The operator that reﬂects a function about the origin, the parity operator in one dimension, is deﬁned by ˆ/Pi1ψ(x)=ψ/prime(x)=ψ(−x). The effect of parity is shown graphically in Figure 6.3. In three dimensions parity changes the sign of all three coordinates: ˆ/Pi1ψ(x,y,z)=ψ(−x,−y,−z).2 Finally, the operator that rotates a function about the zaxis through an angle ϕis most naturally expressed in polar coordinates as ˆRz(ϕ)ψ(r,θ,φ)=ψ/prime(r,θ,φ)=ψ(r,θ,φ−ϕ). (6.2) 2The parity operation in three dimensions can be realized as a mirror reﬂection followed by a rotation (see Prob- lem6.1). In two dimensions, the transformation ψ/prime(x,y)=ψ(−x,−y)is no different from a 180◦rotation. We will use the term parity exclusively for spatial inversion, ˆ/Pi1ψ(r)=ψ(−r), in one or three dimensions.234 CHAPTER 6 Symmetries & Conservation Laws ψ (x) ψ ′ (x) –xx Figure 6.3: A functionψ(x)and the function ψ/prime(x)=ˆ/Pi1ψ(x)=ψ(−x)after a spatial inversion.

When we take up the study of rotations in Section 6.5, we will introduce expressions for rotations about arbitrary axes. The action of the rotation operator on a functionψis illustrated in Figure 6.4. ∗ Problem 6.1 Consider the parity operator in three dimensions. (a)Show thatˆ/Pi1ψ(r)=ψ/prime(r)=ψ(−r)is equivalent to a mirror reﬂection followed by a rotation. (b)Show that, forψexpressed in polar coordinates, the action of the parity operator is ˆ/Pi1ψ(r,θ,φ)=ψ(r,π−θ,φ+π). (c)Show that for the hydrogenic orbitals, ˆ/Pi1ψ n/lscriptm(r,θ,φ)=(−1)/lscriptψn/lscriptm(r,θ,φ). That is,ψn/lscriptmis an eigenstate of the parity operator, with eigenvalue (−1)/lscript. Note: This result actually applies to the stationary states of any central potential V(r)=V(r). For a central potential, the eigenstates may be written in the sepa- rable form Rn/lscript(r)Ym /lscript(θ,φ)where only the radial function Rn/lscript—which plays no role in determining the parity of the state—depends on the speciﬁc functional form ofV(r).6.2 The Translation Operator 235 6.2 THE TRANSLATION OPERATOR Equation 6.1deﬁnes the translation operator. We can express ˆT(a)in terms of the momentum operator, to which it is intimately related. To that end, we replace ψ(x−a)by its Taylor series3 ˆT(a)ψ(x)=ψ(x−a)=∞/summationdisplay n=01 n!(−a)ndn dxnψ(x) =∞/summationdisplay n=01 n!/parenleftbigg−ia /planckover2pi1ˆp/parenrightbiggn ψ(x). The right-hand side of this equation is the exponential function,4so ˆT(a)=exp/bracketleftbigg −ia /planckover2pi1ˆp/bracketrightbigg . (6.3) We say that momentum is the “generator” of translations .5 Note thatˆT(a)is a unitary operator:6 ˆT(a)−1=ˆT(−a)=ˆT(a)†. (6.4) The ﬁrst equality is obvious physically (the inverse operation of shifting something to the right is shifting it by an equal amount to the left), and the second equality then follows from taking the adjoint of Equation 6.3(see Problem 6.2). ∗ Problem 6.2 Show that, for a Hermitian operator ˆQ, the operatorˆU=exp/bracketleftBig iˆQ/bracketrightBig is unitary. Hint: First you need to prove that the adjoint is given by ˆU†=exp/bracketleftBig −iˆQ/bracketrightBig ; then prove thatˆU†ˆU=1. Problem 3.5may help. 6.2.1 How Operators Transform So far I have shown how to translate a function ; this has an obvious graphical interpretation via Figure 6.2. We can also consider what it means to translate an operator . The transformed oper- atorˆQ/primeis deﬁned to be the operator that gives the same expectation value in the untranslated stateψas does the operator ˆQin the translated state ψ/prime: /angbracketleftBig ψ/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ/prime/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig ψ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQ/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ/angbracketrightBig . 3I’m assuming that our function has a Taylor series expansion, but the ﬁnal result applies more generally. See Problem 6.31 for the details. 4See Section 3.6.2 for the deﬁnition of the exponential of an operator. 5The term comes from the study of Lie groups (the group of translations is an example). If you’re interested, an introduction to Lie groups (written for physicists) can be found in George B. Arfken, Hans J. Weber, and Frank E. Harris, Mathematical Methods for Physicists , 7th edn, Academic Press, New York (2013), Section 17.7. 6Unitary operators are discussed in Problem A.30 . A unitary operator is one whose adjoint is also its inverse: ˆUˆU†= ˆU†ˆU=1.236 CHAPTER 6 Symmetries & Conservation Laws There are two ways to calculate the effect of a translation on an expectation value. One could actually shift the wave function over some distance (this is called an active transformation ) orone could leave the wave function where it was and shift the origin of our coordinate system by the same amount in the opposite direction (a passive transformation ). The operator ˆQ/primeis the operator in this shifted coordinate system. Using Equation 6.1, /angbracketleftBig ψ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆT†ˆQˆT/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig ψ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQ/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ/angbracketrightBig . (6.5) Here I am using the fact that the adjoint of an operator is deﬁned such that, if ˆT|f/angbracketright≡| Tf/angbracketright, then/angbracketleftTf|=/angbracketleftf|ˆT†(see Problem 3.5). Because Equation 6.5is to hold for allψ, it follows that ˆQ/prime=ˆT†ˆQˆT. (6.6) The transformed operator for the case ˆQ=ˆxis worked out in Example 6.1. Figure 6.5 illustrates the equivalence of the two ways of carrying out the transformation. Example 6.1 Find the operator ˆx/primeobtained by applying a translation through a distance ato the operator ˆx. That is, what is the action of ˆx/prime, as deﬁned by Equation 6.6, on an arbitrary f(x)? Solution: Using the deﬁnition of ˆx/prime(Equation 6.6) and a test function f(x)we have ˆx/primef(x)=ˆT†(a)ˆxˆT(a)f(x), and sinceˆT†(a)=ˆT(−a)(Equation 6.4), ˆx/primef(x)=ˆT(−a)ˆxˆT(a)f(x). From Equation 6.1 ˆx/primef(x)=ˆT(−a)xf(x−a), and from Equation 6.1again,ˆT(−a)/bracketleftbig xf(x−a)/bracketrightbig =(x+a)f(x),s o ˆx/primef(x)=(x+a)f(x). Finally we may read off the operator ˆx/prime=ˆx+a. (6.7) As expected, Equation 6.7corresponds to shifting the origin of our coordinates to the left by aso that positions in these transformed coordinates are greater by athan in the untransformed coordinates. In Problem 6.3you will apply a translation to the momentum operator to show that ˆp/prime= ˆT†ˆpˆT=ˆp: the momentum operator is unchanged by this transformation. Physically, this is because the particle’s momentum is independent of where you place the origin of your coordinates, depending only on differences in position: p=mdx/dt. Once you know how the position and momentum operators behave under a translation, you know how anyoperator does, since6.2 The Translation Operator 237 x x x′(a) (b) (c) a ba+ba bb a+b Figure 6.5: Active vs. passive transformations: (a) depicts the original function, (b) illustrates an active transformation in which the function is shifted to the right by an amount a, and (c) illustrates a passive transformation where the axes are shifted to the left by an amount a. A point on the wave a distance b from the origin before the transformation is a distance a+bfrom the origin after the transformation in either (b) or (c); this is the equivalence of the two pictures. ˆQ/prime/parenleftbig ˆx,ˆp/parenrightbig =ˆT†ˆQ/parenleftbig ˆx,ˆp/parenrightbigˆT=ˆQ/parenleftbig ˆx/prime,ˆp/prime/parenrightbig =ˆQ/parenleftbig ˆx+a,ˆp/parenrightbig . (6.8) Problem 6.4will walk you through the proof. Problem 6.3 Show that the operator ˆp/primeobtained by applying a translation to the operator ˆp isˆp/prime=ˆT†ˆpˆT=ˆp.238 CHAPTER 6 Symmetries & Conservation Laws Problem 6.4 Prove Equation 6.8.

I am now in a position to make precise the notion of a symmetry that I mentioned in the introduction. A system is translationally invariant (equivalent to saying it has translational symmetry) if the Hamiltonian is unchanged by the transformation: ˆH/prime=ˆT†ˆHˆT=ˆH. BecauseˆTis unitary (Equation 6.4) we can multiply both sides of this equation by ˆTto get ˆHˆT=ˆTˆH. Therefore, a system has translational symmetry if the Hamiltonian commutes with the translation operator:/bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆT/bracketrightBig =0. (6.9) For a particle of mass mmoving in a one-dimensional potential, the Hamiltonian is ˆH=ˆp2 2m+V(x). According to Equation 6.8, the transformed Hamiltonian is ˆH/prime=ˆp2 2m+V(x+a) so translational symmetry implies that V(x+a)=V(x). (6.10) Now, there are two very different physical settings where Equation 6.10 might arise. The ﬁrst is a constant potential, where Equation 6.10 holds for every value of a; such a system is said to have continuous translational symmetry . The second is a periodic potential, such as an electron might encounter in a crystal, where Equation 6.10 holds only for a discrete set of as; such a system is said to have discrete translational symmetry . The two cases are illustrated in Figure 6.6. DISCRETE TRANSLATIONAL SYMMETRY AND BLOCH ’STHEOREM What are the implications of translational symmetry? For a system with a discrete transla- tional symmetry, the most important consequence is Bloch’s theorem; the theorem speciﬁes the form taken by the stationary states. We used this theorem in Section 5.3.2 ; I will now prove it.6.2 The Translation Operator 239 xV (x) xV (x) a Figure 6.6: Potentials for a system with continuous (top) and discrete (bottom) translational symmetry. In the former case the potential is the same when shifted right or left by anyamount; in the latter case the potential is the same when shifted right or left by an integer multiple of a. In Section A.5it is shown that if two operators commute, then they have a complete set of simultaneous eigenstates. This means that if the Hamiltonian is translationally invariant (which is to say, if it commutes with the translation operator), then the eigenstates ψ(x)of the Hamiltonian can be chosen to be simultaneously eigenstates of ˆT: ˆHψ(x)=Eψ(x),ˆT(a)ψ(x)=λψ(x), whereλis the eigenvalue associated with ˆT. SinceˆTis unitary, its eigenvalues have mag- nitude 1 (see Problem A.30 ), which means that λcan be written as λ=eiφfor some real numberφ. By convention we write φ=− qawhere /planckover2pi1qis called the crystal momentum . Therefore, the stationary states of a particle of mass mmoving in a periodic potential have the property ψ(x−a)=e−iq aψ(x). (6.11)240 CHAPTER 6 Symmetries & Conservation Laws There is a more illuminating way to write Equation 6.11:7 ψ(x)=eiqxu(x) (6.12) where u(x)is a periodic function of x:u(x+a)=u(x)andeiq xis a traveling wave (recall that a traveling wave by itself describes a freeparticle—Section 2.4) with wavelength 2 π/q. Equation 6.12 isBloch’s theorem and it says that the stationary states of a particle in a peri- odic potential are periodic functions multiplying traveling waves. Note that just because the Hamiltonian is translationally invariant, that doesn’t mean the stationary states themselves are translationally invariant, it simply means that they can be chosen to be eigenstates of the translation operator. Bloch’s theorem is truly remarkable. It tells us that the stationary states of a particle in a periodic potential (such as an electron in a crystal) are, apart from a periodic modulation, traveling waves. As such, they have a nonzero velocity.8This means that an electron could travel through a perfect crystal without scattering! That has dramatic implications for electronic conduction in solids. CONTINUOUS TRANSLATIONAL SYMMETRY AND MOMENTUM CONSERV ATION If a system has continuous translation symmetry then the Hamiltonian commutes with ˆT(a) for any choice of a. In this case it is useful to consider an inﬁnitesimal translation ˆT(δ)=e−iδˆp//planckover2pi1≈1−iδ /planckover2pi1ˆp, whereδis an inﬁnitesimal length.9 If the Hamiltonian has continuous translational symmetry, then it must be unchanged under any translation, including an inﬁnitesimal one; equivalently it commutes with the translation operator, and hence /bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆT(δ)/bracketrightBig =/bracketleftbigg ˆH,1−iδ /planckover2pi1ˆp/bracketrightbigg =0⇒/bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆp/bracketrightBig =0. So if the Hamiltonian has continuous translational symmetry, it must commute with the momentum operator. And if the Hamiltonian commutes with momentum, then according to the “generalized Ehrenfest’s theorem” (Equation 3.73) d dt/angbracketleftp/angbracketright=i /planckover2pi1/angbracketleftBig/bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆp/bracketrightBig/angbracketrightBig =0. (6.13) 7It is clear that Equation 6.12 satisﬁes Equation 6.11. In Problem 6.5you’ll prove that they are in fact equivalent statements. 8For a delightful proof using perturbation theory, see Neil Ashcroft and N. David Mermin, Solid State Physics , Cengage, Belmont, 1976 (p. 765), after you have completed Problem 6.6and studied Chapter 7. 9For the case of continuous symmetries, it is often much easier to work with the inﬁnitesimal form of the transfor- mation; any ﬁnite transformation can then be built up as a product of inﬁnitesimal transformations. In particular, the ﬁnite translation by ais a sequence of Ninﬁnitesimal translations with δ=a/Nin the limit that N→∞ : lim N→∞/parenleftbigg 1−ia N1 /planckover2pi1ˆp/parenrightbiggN =exp/bracketleftbigg −ia /planckover2pi1ˆp/bracketrightbigg . For a proof see R. Shankar, Basic Training in Mathematics: A Fitness Program for Science Students , Plenum Press, New York, 1995 (p.11).6.2 The Translation Operator 241 This is a statement of momentum conservation and we have now shown that continuous translational symmetry implies that momentum is conserved. This is our ﬁrst example of a powerful general principle: symmetries imply conservation laws .10 Of course, if we’re talking about a single particle of mass mmoving in a potential V(x), the only potential that has continuous translational symmetry is the constant potential, which is equivalent to the free particle. And it is pretty obvious that momentum is conserved in that case. But the analysis here readily extends to a system of interacting particles (see Problem 6.7). The fact that momentum is conserved in that case as well (so long as the Hamiltonian is transla- tionally invariant) is a highly nontrivial result. In any event, the point to remember is that conservation of momentum is a consequence of translational symmetry . Problem 6.5 Show that Equation 6.12 follows from Equation 6.11.Hint: First writeψ(x)= eiqxu(x), which is certainly true for some u(x), and then show that u(x)is necessarily a periodic function of x. ∗∗∗ Problem 6.6 Consider a particle of mass mmoving in a potential V(x)with period a.W e know from Bloch’s theorem that the wave function can be written in the form of Equa- tion6.12.Note: It is conventional to label the states with quantum numbers nandqas ψnq(x)=e−iqxunq(x)where Enqis the nth energy for a given value of q.

(6.14) (b)Use the technique from Problem 2.61 to solve the differential equation for unq. You need to use a two-sided difference for the ﬁrst derivative so that you have a Hermitian matrix to diagonalize:dψ dx≈ψj+1−ψj−1 2/Delta1x. For the potential in the interval 0t oalet V(x)=/braceleftbigg−V0a/4<x<3a/4 0e l s e with V0=20/planckover2pi12/2ma2. (You will need to modify the technique slightly to account for the fact that the function unqis periodic.) Find the lowest two energies for the following values of the crystal momentum: qa=−π,−π/2, 0,π/2,π.N o t e thatqandq+2π/adescribe the same wave function (Equation 6.12), so there is no reason to consider values of qaoutside of the interval from −πtoπ.I n solid state physics, the values of qinside this range constitute the ﬁrst Brillouin zone . (c)Make a plot of the energies E1qandE2qfor values of qbetween−π/aandπ/a. If you’ve automated the code that you used in part (b), you should be able to show a large number of qvalues in this range. If not, simply plot the values that you computed in (b). 10In the case of a discrete translational symmetry, momentum is not conserved, but there is a conserved quantity closely related to the discrete translational symmetry, which is the crystal momentum. For a discussion of crystal momentum see Steven H. Simon, The Oxford Solid State Basics , Oxford, 2013, p.84.242 CHAPTER 6 Symmetries & Conservation Laws Problem 6.7 Consider two particles of mass m1andm2(in one dimension) that interact via a potential that depends only on the distance between the particles V(|x1−x2|), so that the Hamiltonian is ˆH=−/planckover2pi12 2m1∂2 ∂x2 1−/planckover2pi12 2m2∂2 ∂x2 2+V(|x1−x2|). Acting on a two-particle wave function the translation operator would be ˆT(a)ψ(x1,x2)=ψ(x1−a,x2−a). (a)Show that the translation operator can be written ˆT(a)=e−ia /planckover2pi1ˆP, whereˆP=ˆp1+ˆp2is the total momentum. (b)Show that the total momentum is conserved for this system. 6.3 CONSERVATION LAWS In classical mechanics the meaning of a conservation law is straightforward: the quantity in question is the same before and after some event. Drop a rock, and potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but the total is the same just before it hits the ground as when it was released; collide two billiard balls and momentum is transferred from one to the other, but the total remains unchanged. But in quantum mechanics a system does not in general have a deﬁnite energy (or momentum) before the process begins (or afterward). What does it mean , in that case, to say that the observable Qis (or is not) conserved? Here are two possibilities: •First deﬁnition :T h e expectation value /angbracketleftQ/angbracketrightis independent of time. •Second deﬁnition : The probability of getting any particular value is independent of time. Under what conditions does each of these conservation laws hold? Let us stipulate that the observable in question does not depend explicitly on time: ∂Q/∂t=0. In that case the generalized Ehrenfest theorem (Equation 3.73) tells us that the expectation value of Qis independent of time if The operator ˆQ commutes with the Hamiltonian. It so happens that the same criterion guaranatees conservation by the second deﬁnition. I will now prove this result. Recall that the probability of getting the result qnin a measurement of Qat time tis (Equation 3.43) P(qn)=|/angbracketleftfn|/Psi1(t)/angbracketright|2, (6.15) where fnis the corresponding eigenvector: ˆQ|fn/angbracketright= qn|fn/angbracketright.11We know that the time evolution of the wave function is (Equation 2.17) 11If the spectrum of ˆQis degenerate/parenleftbig there are distinct eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue qn:ˆQ|f(i) n/angbracketright= qn|f(i) n/angbracketrightfori=1,2,.../parenrightbig , then we need to sum over those states: P(qn)=/summationdisplay i/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/angbracketleftBig f(i) n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/Psi1(t)/angbracketrightBig/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2 .

Evidently, the parity operator is its own inverse: ˆ/Pi1−1=ˆ/Pi1; in Problem 6.8you will show that it is Hermitian: ˆ/Pi1†=ˆ/Pi1. Putting this together, the parity operator is unitary as well: ˆ/Pi1−1=ˆ/Pi1=ˆ/Pi1†. (6.16) Operators transform under a spatial inversion as ˆQ/prime=ˆ/Pi1†ˆQˆ/Pi1. (6.17) I won’t repeat the argument leading up to Equation 6.17, since it is identical to the one by which we arrived at Equation 6.6in the case of translations. The position and momentum operators are “odd under parity” (Problem 6.10): ˆx/prime=ˆ/Pi1†ˆxˆ/Pi1=−ˆx, (6.18) ˆp/prime=ˆ/Pi1†ˆpˆ/Pi1=−ˆ p, (6.19) and this tells us how anyoperator transforms (see Problem 6.4): ˆQ/prime/parenleftbig ˆx,ˆp/parenrightbig =ˆ/Pi1†ˆQ/parenleftbig ˆx,ˆp/parenrightbigˆ/Pi1=ˆQ/parenleftbig −ˆx,−ˆp/parenrightbig . A system has inversion symmetry if the Hamiltonian is unchanged by a parity transforma- tion: ˆH/prime=ˆ/Pi1†ˆHˆ/Pi1=ˆH, or, using the unitarity of the parity operator, /bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆ/Pi1/bracketrightBig =0. (6.20)244 CHAPTER 6 Symmetries & Conservation Laws If our Hamiltonian describes a particle of mass min a one-dimensional potential V(x), then inversion symmetry simply means that the potential is an even function of position: V(x)=V(−x). The implications of inversion symmetry are two: First, we can ﬁnd a complete set of simultaneous eigenstates of ˆ/Pi1andˆH. Let such an eigenstate be written ψn; it satisﬁes ˆ/Pi1ψ n(x)=ψn(−x)=±ψn(x), since the eigenvalues of the parity operator are restricted to ±1 (Problem 6.8). So the sta- tionary states of a potential that is an even function of position are themselves even or odd functions (or can be chosen as such, in the case of degeneracy).12This property is familiar from the simple harmonic oscillator, the inﬁnite square well (if the origin is placed at the center of the well), and the Dirac delta function potential, and you proved it in general in Problem 2.1. Second, according to Ehrenfest’s theorem, if the Hamiltonian has an inversion symmetry then d dt/angbracketleft/Pi1/angbracketright=i /planckover2pi1/angbracketleftBig/bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆ/Pi1/bracketrightBig/angbracketrightBig =0 soparity is conserved for a particle moving in a symmetric potential. And not just the expecta- tion value, but the probability of any particular outcome in a measurement, in accord with the theorem of Section 6.3. Parity conservation means, for example, that if the wave function of a particle in a harmonic oscillator potential is even at t=0 then it will be even at any later time t; see Figure 6.7. ∗ Problem 6.8 (a)Show that the parity operator ˆ/Pi1is Hermitian. (b)Show that the eigenvalues of the parity operator are ±1. 6.4.2 Parity in Three Dimensions The spatial inversion generated by the parity operator in three dimensions is ˆ/Pi1ψ(r)=ψ/prime(r)=ψ(−r). The operatorsˆrandˆptransform as ˆr/prime=ˆ/Pi1†ˆrˆ/Pi1=−ˆr, (6.21) ˆp/prime=ˆ/Pi1†ˆpˆ/Pi1=−ˆp. (6.22) Any other operator transforms as ˆQ/prime/parenleftbigˆr,ˆp/parenrightbig =ˆ/Pi1†ˆQ/parenleftbigˆr,ˆp/parenrightbigˆ/Pi1=ˆQ/parenleftbig −ˆr,−ˆp/parenrightbig . (6.23) 12For bound (normalizable) states in one dimension, there is no degeneracy and every bound state of a symmetric potential is automatically an eigenstate of parity. (However, see Problem 2.46.) For scattering states, degeneracy does occur.6.4 Parity 245 Figure 6.7: This ﬁlmstrip shows the time evolution of a particular wave function/parenleftBig /Psi10(ξ)=Aξ2e−ξ2/2/parenrightBig for a particle in the harmonic oscillator potential. The solid and dashed curves are the real and imaginary parts of the wave function respectively, and time increases from top to bottom. Since parity is conserved, a wave function which is initially an even function of position (as this one is) remains an even function at all later times. Example 6.2 Find the parity-transformed angular momentum operator ˆL/prime=ˆ/Pi1†ˆLˆ/Pi1, in terms ofˆL. Solution: Since L=r×p, Equation 6.23 tells us that ˆL/prime=ˆ/Pi1†ˆLˆ/Pi1=ˆr/prime×ˆp/prime=/parenleftbig −ˆr/parenrightbig ×/parenleftbig −ˆp/parenrightbig =ˆr×ˆp=ˆL. (6.24) We have a special name for vectors like ˆL, that are even under parity. We call them pseu- dovectors , since they don’t change sign under parity the way “true” vectors, such as ˆrorˆp,246 CHAPTER 6 Symmetries & Conservation Laws do. Similarly, scalars that are oddunder parity are called pseudoscalars , since they do not behave under parity the way that “true” scalars (such as ˆr·ˆrwhich is even under parity) do. See Problem 6.9.Note: The labels scalar andvector describe how the operators behave under rotations ; we will deﬁne these terms carefully in the next section. “True” vectors and pseudovectors behave the same way under a rotation—they are both vectors. In three dimensions, the Hamiltonian for a particle of mass mmoving in a potential V(r) will have inversion symmetry if V(−r)=V(r). Importantly, any central potential satisﬁes this condition. As in the one-dimensional case, parity is conserved for such systems, and the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian may be chosen to be simultaneously eigenstates of par- ity. In Problem 6.1you proved that the eigenstates of a particle in a central potential, written ψn/lscriptm(r,θ,φ)=Rn/lscript(r)Ym /lscript(θ,φ), are eigenstates of parity:13 ˆ/Pi1ψ n/lscriptm(r,θ,φ)=(−1)/lscriptψn/lscriptm(r,θ,φ). ∗ Problem 6.9 (a)Under parity, a “true” scalar operator does not change: ˆ/Pi1†ˆfˆ/Pi1=ˆf, whereas a pseudoscalar changes sign. Show therefore that/bracketleftBig ˆ/Pi1,ˆf/bracketrightBig =0 for a “true” scalar, whereas/braceleftBig ˆ/Pi1,ˆf/bracerightBig =0 for a pseudoscalar. Note:t h e anti-commutator of two operatorsˆAandˆBis deﬁned as/braceleftBig ˆA,ˆB/bracerightBig ≡ˆAˆB+ˆBˆA. (b)Similarly, a “true” vector changes sign ˆ/Pi1†ˆVˆ/Pi1=−ˆV, whereas a pseudovector is unchanged. Show therefore that/braceleftBig ˆ/Pi1,ˆV/bracerightBig =0for a “true” vector and/bracketleftBig ˆ/Pi1,ˆV/bracketrightBig =0for a pseudovector. 6.4.3 Parity Selection Rules Selection rules tell you when a matrix element is zero based on the symmetry of the situation. Recall that a matrix element is any object of the form /angbracketleftb|ˆQ|a/angbracketright; an expectation value is a special case of a matrix element with a=b=ψ. One operator whose selection rules are physically important is the electric dipole moment operator ˆpe=qˆr. The selection rules for this operator—the operator itself is nothing more than the charge of the particle times its position—determine which atomic transitions are allowed and which are forbidden (see Chapter 11). It is odd under parity since the position vector ˆris odd: 13Note that Equation 6.24 could equivalently be written as/bracketleftBig ˆ/Pi1,ˆL/bracketrightBig =0. The fact that parity commutes with every component of the angular momentum/parenleftbig and therefore also ˆL2/parenrightbig is the reason you can ﬁnd simultaneous eigenstates ofˆL2,ˆLz,a n dˆ/Pi1.6.4 Parity 247 ˆ/Pi1†ˆpeˆ/Pi1=−ˆpe. (6.25) Now consider the matrix elements of the electric dipole operator between two states ψn/lscriptmandψn/prime/lscript/primem/prime(we label the corresponding kets |n/lscriptm/angbracketrightand|n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/angbracketright). Using Equation 6.25 we have /angbracketleftbig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆpe/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightbig =−/angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆ/Pi1†ˆpeˆ/Pi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =−/angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(−1)/lscript/primeˆpe(−1)/lscript/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =(−1)/lscript+/lscript/prime+1/angbracketleftbig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆpe/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightbig . From this we see immediately that /angbracketleftbig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆpe/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightbig =0if/lscript+/lscript/primeis even. (6.26) This is called Laporte’s rule ; it says that matrix elements of the dipole moment operator vanish between states with the same parity. The reasoning by which we obtained Equation 6.26 can be generalized to derive selection rules for any operator, as long as you know how that operator transforms under parity. In particular, Laporte’s rule applies to any operator that is odd under parity . The selection rule for an operator that is even under parity, such as ˆL, is derived in Problem 6.11. Problem 6.10 Show that the position and momentum operators are odd under parity. That is, prove Equations 6.18,6.19, and, by extension, 6.21 and6.22. ∗ Problem 6.11 Consider the matrix elements of ˆLbetween two deﬁnite-parity states: /angbracketleftn/prime/lscript/primem/prime|ˆL|n/lscriptm/angbracketright. Under what conditions is this matrix element guaranteed to vanish? Note that the same selection rule would apply to any pseudovector operator, or any “true” scalar operator. Problem 6.12 Spin angular momentum, ˆS, is even under parity, just like orbital angular momentumˆL: ˆ/Pi1†ˆSˆ/Pi1=ˆS or/bracketleftBig ˆ/Pi1,ˆS/bracketrightBig =0. (6.27) Acting on a spinor written in the standard basis (Equation 4.139 ), the parity operator becomes a 2×2 matrix. Show that, due to Equation 6.27, this matrix must be a con- stant times the identity matrix. As such, the parity of a spinor isn’t very interesting since both spin states are parity eigenstates with the same eigenvalue. We can arbitrarily choose that parity to be +1, so the parity operator has no effect on the spin portion of the wave function.14 14However, it turns out that antiparticles of spin 1 /2 have opposite parity. Thus the electron is conventionally assigned parity+1, but the positron then has parity −1.248 CHAPTER 6 Symmetries & Conservation Laws ∗ Problem 6.13 Consider an electron in a hydrogen atom. (a)Show that if the electron is in the ground state, then necessarily /angbracketleftpe/angbracketright= 0. No calculation allowed. (b)Show that if the electron is in an n=2 state, then/angbracketleftpe/angbracketrightneed not vanish. Give an example of a wave function for the energy level n=2 that has a non-vanishing /angbracketleftpe/angbracketright and compute/angbracketleftpe/angbracketrightfor this state. 6.5 ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY 6.5.1 Rotations About the zAxis The operator that rotates a function about the zaxis by an angle ϕ(Equation 6.2) ˆRz(ϕ)ψ(r,θ,φ)=ψ/prime(r,θ,φ)=ψ(r,θ,φ−ϕ) (6.28) is closely related to the zcomponent of angular momentum (Equation 4.129 ). By the same reasoning that led to Equation 6.3, ˆRz(ϕ)=exp/bracketleftbigg −iϕ /planckover2pi1ˆLz/bracketrightbigg , (6.29) and we say that ˆLzis the generator of rotations about the zaxis (compare Equation 6.3). How do the operators ˆrandˆptransform under rotations? To answer this question we use the inﬁnitesimal form of the operator: ˆRz(δ)≈1−iδ /planckover2pi1ˆLz. Then the operator ˆxtransforms as ˆx/prime=ˆR†ˆxˆR≈/parenleftbigg 1+iδ /planckover2pi1ˆLz/parenrightbigg ˆx/parenleftbigg 1−iδ /planckover2pi1ˆLz/parenrightbigg ≈ˆx+iδ /planckover2pi1/bracketleftBig ˆLz,ˆx/bracketrightBig ≈ˆx−δˆy (I used Equation 4.122 for the commutator). Similar calculations show that ˆy/prime=ˆy+δˆxand ˆz/prime=ˆz. We can combine these results into a matrix equation ⎛ ⎝ˆx/prime ˆy/prime ˆz/prime⎞ ⎠=⎛ ⎝1−δ0 δ10 001⎞ ⎠⎛ ⎝ˆx ˆy ˆz⎞ ⎠. (6.30) That doesn’t look quite right for a rotation. Shouldn’t it be ⎛ ⎝ˆx/prime ˆy/prime ˆz/prime⎞ ⎠=⎛ ⎝cosϕ−sinϕ0 sinϕ cosϕ 0 00 1⎞ ⎠⎛ ⎝ˆx ˆy ˆz⎞ ⎠? (6.31) Yes, but don’t forget, we are assuming ϕ→δis inﬁnitesimal, so (dropping terms of order δ2 and higher) cos ϕ→1 and sinϕ→δ.15 15To go the other way, from inﬁnitesimal to ﬁnite, see Problem 6.14.6.5 Rotational Symmetry 249 ∗∗ Problem 6.14 In this problem you will establish the correspondence between Equa- tions 6.30 and6.31. (a)Diagonalize the matrix16 M=/parenleftbigg1−ϕ/N ϕ/N 1/parenrightbigg to obtain the matrix M/prime=SMS−1, where S−1is the unitary matrix whose columns are the (normalized) eigenvectors ofM. (b)Use the binomial expansion to show that lim N→∞/parenleftbig M/prime/parenrightbigNis a diagonal matrix with entries e−iϕandeiϕon the diagonal. (c)Transform back to the original basis to show that lim N→∞MN=S−1/bracketleftbigg lim N→∞/parenleftbig M/prime/parenrightbigN/bracketrightbigg S agrees with the matrix in Equation 6.31. 6.5.2 Rotations in Three Dimensions Equation 6.29 can be generalized in the obvious way to a rotation about an axis along the unit vector n: ˆRn(ϕ)=exp/bracketleftbigg −iϕ /planckover2pi1n·ˆL/bracketrightbigg (6.32) Just as linear momentum is the generator of translations, angular momentum is the generator of rotations. Any operator (with three components) that transforms the same way as the position operator under rotations is called a vector operator . By “transforms the same way” we mean that ˆV/prime=DˆVwhere Dis the same matrix as appears in ˆr/prime=Dˆr. In particular for a rotation about thezaxis, we would have (Equation 6.31) ⎛ ⎜⎝ˆV/prime x ˆV/prime y ˆV/prime z⎞ ⎟⎠=⎛ ⎝cosϕ−sinϕ0 sinϕ cosϕ 0 00 1⎞ ⎠⎛ ⎜⎝ˆVx ˆVy ˆVz⎞ ⎟⎠. This transformation rule follows from the commutation relations17 /bracketleftBig ˆLi,ˆVj/bracketrightBig =i/planckover2pi1/epsilon1ijkˆVk, (6.33) 16See Section A.5. 17The Levi-Civita symbol /epsilon1ijkis deﬁned in Problem 4.29.250 CHAPTER 6 Symmetries & Conservation Laws Table 6.1: Operators are classiﬁed as vectors or scalars based on their commutation relations with ˆL, which encode how they transform under a rotation, and as pseudo- or “true” quantities based on their commutation relations with ˆ/Pi1, which encode how they transform under a spatial inversion. The curly brackets in the ﬁrst column denote the anti-commutator, deﬁned in Problem 6.9. To include the spin ˆSin this table, one simply replaces ˆLieverywhere it appears in the third column with ˆJi=ˆLi+ˆSi (Problems 6.12 and6.32, respectively, discuss the effect of parity and rotations on spinors).ˆS, likeˆL, is then a pseudovector and ˆp·ˆSis a pseudoscalar. parity rotations examples true vectorˆV/braceleftBig ˆ/Pi1,ˆVi/bracerightBig =0/bracketleftBig ˆLi,ˆVj/bracketrightBig =i/planckover2pi1/epsilon1ijkˆVkˆr,ˆp pseudovectorˆV/bracketleftBig ˆ/Pi1,ˆVi/bracketrightBig =0/bracketleftBig ˆLi,ˆVj/bracketrightBig =i/planckover2pi1/epsilon1ijkˆVkˆL true scalarˆf/bracketleftBig ˆ/Pi1,ˆf/bracketrightBig =0/bracketleftBig ˆLi,ˆf/bracketrightBig =0 ˆr·ˆr pseudoscalarˆf/braceleftBig ˆ/Pi1,ˆf/bracerightBig =0/bracketleftBig ˆLi,ˆf/bracketrightBig =0 (see Problem 6.16), and we may take Equation 6.33 as the deﬁnition of a vector operator. So far we have encountered three such operators, ˆr,ˆpandˆL: /bracketleftBig ˆLi,ˆrj/bracketrightBig =i/planckover2pi1/epsilon1ijkˆrk,/bracketleftBig ˆLi,ˆpj/bracketrightBig =i/planckover2pi1/epsilon1ijkˆpk,/bracketleftBig ˆLi,ˆLj/bracketrightBig =i/planckover2pi1/epsilon1ijkˆLk (see Equations 4.99 and4.122 ). Ascalar operator is a single quantity that is unchanged by rotations; this is equivalent to saying that the operator commutes with ˆL: /bracketleftBig ˆLi,ˆf/bracketrightBig =0. (6.34) We can now classify operators as either scalars or vectors, based on their commutation relations withˆL(how they transform under a rotation), and as “true” or pseudo-quantities, based on their commutators with ˆ/Pi1(how they transform under parity). These results are summarized in Table 6.1.18 CONTINUOUS ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY For a particle of mass mmoving in a potential V(r), the Hamiltonian ˆH=ˆp2 2m+V(r) is rotationally invariant if V(r)=V(r)(the central potentials studied in Section 4.1.1 ). In this case the Hamiltonian commutes with a rotation by any angle about an arbitrary axis 18Of course, not every operator will ﬁt into one of these categories. Scalar and vector operators are simply the ﬁrst two instances in a hierarchy of tensor operators. Next come second-rank tensors (the inertia tensor from classical mechanics or the quadrupole tensor from electrodynamics are examples), third-rank tensors, and so forth.6.5 Rotational Symmetry 251 /bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆRn(ϕ)/bracketrightBig =0. (6.35) In particular, Equation 6.35 must hold for an inﬁnitesimal rotation Rn(δ)≈1−iδ /planckover2pi1n·ˆL, which means that the Hamiltonian commutes with the three components of L: /bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆL/bracketrightBig =0. (6.36) What, then, are the consequences of rotational invariance? From Equation 6.36 and Ehrenfest’s theorem d dt/angbracketleftL/angbracketright=i /planckover2pi1/angbracketleftBig/bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆL/bracketrightBig/angbracketrightBig =0 (6.37) for a central potential. Thus, angular momentum conservation is a consequence of rotational invariance . And beyond the statement 6.37, angular momentum conservation means that the probability distributions (for each component of the angular momentum) are independent of time as well—see Section 6.3. Since the Hamiltonian for a central potential commutes with all three components of angular momentum, it also commutes with ˆL2. The operators ˆH,ˆLz, andˆL2form a complete set of compatible observables for the bound states of a central potential. Compatible means that they commute pairwise /bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆL2/bracketrightBig =0, /bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆLz/bracketrightBig =0, (6.38) /bracketleftBig ˆLz,ˆL2/bracketrightBig =0, so that the eigenstates of ˆHcan be chosen to be simultaneous eigenstates of ˆL2andˆLz. ˆHψn/lscriptm=Enψn/lscriptm, ˆLzψn/lscriptm=m/planckover2pi1ψn/lscriptm, ˆL2ψn/lscriptm=/lscript(/lscript+1)/planckover2pi12ψn/lscriptm. Saying they are complete means that the quantum numbers n,/lscript, and muniquely specify a bound state of the Hamiltonian. This is familiar from our solution to the hydrogen atom, the inﬁnite spherical well, and the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator, but it is true for any central potential.19 ∗ Problem 6.15 Show how Equation 6.34 guarantees that a scalar is unchanged by a rotation: ˆf/prime=ˆR†ˆfˆR=ˆf. 19This follows from the fact that the radial Schrödinger equation (Equation 4.35) has at most a single normalizable solution so that, once you have speciﬁed /lscriptandm, the energy uniquely speciﬁes the state. The principal quantum number nindexes those energy values that lead to normalizable solutions.252 CHAPTER 6 Symmetries & Conservation Laws ∗ Problem 6.16 Working from Equation 6.33, ﬁnd how the vector operator ˆVtransforms for an inﬁnitesimal rotation by an angle δabout the yaxis. That is, ﬁnd the matrix Din ˆV/prime=DˆV. Problem 6.17 Consider the action of an inﬁnitesimal rotation about the naxis of an angular momentum eigenstate ψn/lscriptm. Show that ˆRn(δ)ψn/lscriptm=/summationdisplay m/primeDm/primemψn/lscriptm/prime, and ﬁnd the complex numbers Dm/primem(they will depend on δ,n, and/lscriptas well as m andm/prime). This result makes sense: a rotation doesn’t change the magnitude of the angu- lar momentum (speciﬁed by /lscript)but does change its projection along the zaxis (speciﬁed bym). 6.6 DEGENERACY Symmetry is the source of most20degeneracy in quantum mechanics. We have seen that a symmetry implies the existence of an operator ˆQthat commutes with the Hamiltonian /bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆQ/bracketrightBig =0. (6.39) So why does symmetry lead to degeneracy in the energy spectrum? The basic idea is this: if we have a stationary state |ψn/angbracketright, then|ψ/prime n/angbracketright=ˆQ|ψn/angbracketrightis a stationary state with the same energy. The proof is straightforward: ˆH/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ/prime n/angbracketrightbig =ˆH/parenleftBig ˆQ|ψn/angbracketright/parenrightBig =ˆQˆH|ψn/angbracketright=ˆQE n|ψn/angbracketright=En/parenleftBig ˆQ|ψn/angbracketright/parenrightBig =En/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ/prime n/angbracketrightbig . For example, if you have an eigenstate of a spherically-symmetric Hamiltonian and you rotate that state about some axis, you must get back another state of the same energy. You might think that symmetry would always lead to degeneracy, and that continuous sym- metries would lead to inﬁnite degeneracy, but that is not the case. The reason is that the two states|ψn/angbracketrightand|ψ/prime n/angbracketrightmight be the same.21As an example, consider the Hamiltonian for the harmonic oscillator in one dimension; it commutes with parity. All of its stationary states are either even or odd, so when you act on one with the parity operator you get back the same state 20When we can’t identify the symmetry responsible for a particular degeneracy, we call it an accidental degeneracy . In most such cases, the degeneracy turns out to be no accident at all, but instead due to symmetry that is more difﬁcult to identify than, say, rotational invariance. The canonical example is the larger symmetry group of the hydrogen atom (Problem 6.34). 21This is highly non-classical. In classical mechanics, if you take a Keplerian orbit there will always be some axis about which you can rotate it to get a different Keplerian orbit (of the same energy) and in fact there will be an inﬁnite number of such orbits with different orientations. In quantum mechanics, if you rotate the ground state of hydrogen you get back exactly the same state regardless of which axis you choose, and if you rotate one of the states with n=2a n d/lscript=1, you get back a linear combination of the three orthogonal states with these quantum numbers.6.6 Degeneracy 253 you started with (perhaps multiplied by −1, but that, physically, isthe same state). There is therefore no degeneracy associated with inversion symmetry in this case. In fact, if there is only a single symmetry operator ˆQ(or if there are multiple symmetry operators that all commute), you do not get degeneracy in the spectrum. The reason is the same theorem we’ve now quoted many times: since ˆQandˆHcommute, we can ﬁnd simultaneous eigenstates|ψn/angbracketrightofˆQandˆHand these states transform into themselves under the symmetry operation:ˆQ|ψn/angbracketright=qn|ψn/angbracketright. But what if there are twooperators that commute with the Hamiltonian/parenleftbig call themˆQand ˆ/Lambda1/parenrightbig , but do notcommute with each other? In this case, degeneracy in the energy spectrum is inevitable. Why? First, consider a state |ψ/angbracketrightthat is an eigenstate of both ˆHandˆQwith eigenvalues Enand qmrespectively. Since ˆHandˆ/Lambda1commute we know that the state |g/angbracketright=ˆ/Lambda1|ψ/angbracketrightis also an eigenstate ofˆHwith eigenvalue En. SinceˆQandˆ/Lambda1donotcommute we know (Section A.5) that there cannot exist a complete set of simultaneous eigenstates of all three operators/parenleftbigˆQ,ˆ/Lambda1 andˆH/parenrightbig . Therefore, there must be some |ψ/angbracketrightsuch thatˆ/Lambda1|ψ/angbracketrightis distinct from |ψ/angbracketright/parenleftbig speciﬁcally, it is not an eigenstate of ˆ/Lambda1/parenrightbig meaning that the energy level Enis at least doubly degenerate. The presence of multiple non-commuting symmetry operators guarantees degeneracy of the energy spectrum . This is precisely the situation we have encountered in the case of central potentials. Here the Hamiltonian commutes with rotations about any axis (or equivalently with the generators ˆLx,ˆLy, andˆLz/parenrightbig but those rotations don’t commute with each other. So we know that there will be degeneracy in the spectrum of a particle in a central potential. The following example shows exactly how much degeneracy is explained by rotational invariance. Example 6.3 Consider an eigenstate of a central potential ψn/lscriptmwith energy En. Use the fact that the Hamiltonian for a central potential commutes with any component of ˆL, and therefore also withˆL+andˆL−, to show thatψn/lscriptm±1are necessarily also eigenstates with the same energy asψn/lscriptm.22 Solution: Since the Hamiltonian commutes with ˆL±we have /parenleftBig ˆHˆL±−ˆL±ˆH/parenrightBig ψn/lscriptm=0, so ˆHˆL±ψn/lscriptm=ˆL±ˆHψn/lscriptm=EnˆL±ψn/lscriptm or ˆHψn/lscriptm±1=Enψn/lscriptm±1 (I canceled the constant /planckover2pi1√/lscript(/lscript+1)−m(m±1)from both sides in the last expression). This argument could obviously be repeated to show that ψn/lscriptm±2has the same energy as 22Of course, we already know the energies are equal since the radial equation, Equation 4.35, does not depend on m. This example demonstrates that rotational invariance is behind the degeneracy.254 CHAPTER 6 Symmetries & Conservation Laws ψn/lscriptm±1, and so on until you’ve exhausted the ladder of states. Therefore, rotational invari- ance explains why states which differ only in the quantum number m have the same energy , and since there are 2 /lscript+1 different values of m,2/lscript+1 is the “normal” degeneracy for energies in a central potential. Of course, the degeneracy of hydrogen (neglecting spin) is n2(=1,4,9,...)(Equation 4.85) which is greater than 2/lscript+1(=1,3,5,...).23Evidently hydrogen has more degener- acy than is explained by rotational invariance alone. The source of the extra degeneracy is an additional symmetry that is unique to the 1 /rpotential; this is explored in Problem 6.34.24 In this section we have focused on continuous rotational symmetry, but discrete rotational symmetry, as experienced (for instance) by an electron in a crystal, can also be of interest. Problem 6.33 explores one such system. Problem 6.18 Consider the free particle in one dimension: ˆH=ˆp2/2m. This Hamiltonian has both translational symmetry and inversion symmetry. (a)Show that translations and inversion don’t commute. (b)Because of the translational symmetry we know that the eigenstates of ˆHcan be chosen to be simultaneous eigenstates of momentum, namely fp(x)(Equa- tion3.32). Show that the parity operator turns fp(x)into f−p(x); these two states must therefore have the same energy. (c)Alternatively, because of the inversion symmetry we know that the eigenstates of ˆHcan be chosen to be simultaneous eigenstates of parity, namely 1√ π/planckover2pi1cos/parenleftBigpx /planckover2pi1/parenrightBig and1√ π/planckover2pi1sin/parenleftBigpx /planckover2pi1/parenrightBig . Show that the translation operator mixes these two states together; they therefore must be degenerate. Note: Both parity andtranslational invariance are required to explain the degeneracy in the free-particle spectrum. Without parity, there is no reason for fp(x)and f−p(x)to have the same energy (I mean no reason based on symmetries discussed thus far ...o b v i o u s l yy o u can plug them in to the time-independent Schrödinger equation and show it’s true). Problem 6.19 For any vector operator ˆVone can deﬁne raising and lowering operators as ˆV±=ˆVx±iˆVy. (a)Using Equation 6.33, show that /bracketleftBig ˆLz,ˆV±/bracketrightBig =±/planckover2pi1ˆV+. /bracketleftBig ˆL2,ˆV±/bracketrightBig =2/planckover2pi12ˆV±±2/planckover2pi1ˆV±ˆLz∓2/planckover2pi1ˆVzˆL±. 23I don’t mean that they necessarily occur in this order. Look back at the inﬁnite spherical well (Figure 4.3): starting with the ground state the degeneracies are =1,3,5,1,7,3,9,5,.... These are precisely the degrees of degeneracy we expect for rotational invariance (2/lscript+1 for integer/lscript)but the symmetry considerations don’t tell us where in the spectrum each degeneracy will occur. 24For the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator the degeneracy is n(n+1)/2=1,3,6,10,... (Problem 4.46) which again is greater than 2 /lscript+1. For a discussion of the additional symmetry in the oscillator problem see D. M. Fradkin, A m .J .P h y s . 33, 207 (1965).6.7 Rotational Selection Rules 255 (b)Show that, ifψis an eigenstate of ˆL2andˆLzwith eigenvalues /lscript(/lscript+1)/planckover2pi12and /lscript/planckover2pi1respectively, then either ˆV+ψis zero orˆV+ψis also an eigenstate of ˆL2and ˆLzwith eigenvalues (/lscript+1)(/lscript+2)/planckover2pi12and(/lscript+1)/planckover2pi1respectively. This means that, acting on a state with maximal m/lscript=/lscript, the operator ˆV+either “raises” both the /lscript andmvalues by 1 or destroys the state. 6.7 ROTATIONAL SELECTION RULES The most general statement of the rotational selection rules is the Wigner–Eckart Theorem ; as a practical matter, it is arguably the most important theorem in all of quantum mechanics. Rather than prove the theorem in full generality I will work out the selection rules for the two classes of operators one encounters most often: scalar operators (in Section 6.7.1 ) and vector operators (in Section 6.7.2 ). In deriving these selection rules we consider only how the operators behave under a rotation; therefore, the results of this section apply equally well to “true” scalars and pseudoscalars, and those of the next section apply equally well to “true” vectors and pseudeovectors. These selection rules can be combined with the parity selection rules of Section 6.4.3 to obtain a larger set of selection rules for the operator. 6.7.1 Selection Rules for Scalar Operators The commutation relations for a scalar operator ˆfwith the three components of angular momentum (Equation 6.34) can be rewritten in terms of the raising and lowering operators as /bracketleftBig ˆLz,ˆf/bracketrightBig =0 (6.40) /bracketleftBig ˆL±,ˆf/bracketrightBig =0 (6.41) /bracketleftBig ˆL2,ˆf/bracketrightBig =0. (6.42) We derive selection rules for ˆfby sandwiching these commutators between two states of deﬁnite angular momentum, which we will write as |n/lscriptm/angbracketrightand|n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/angbracketright. These might be hydrogenic orbitals, but they need not be (in fact they need not even be eigenstates of any Hamiltonian but I’ll leave the quantum number nthere so they look familiar); we require only that|n/lscriptm/angbracketrightis an eigenstate of ˆL2andˆLzwith quantum numbers /lscriptandmrespectively.25 Sandwiching Equation 6.40 between two such states gives /angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/bracketleftBig ˆLz,ˆf/bracketrightBig/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =0 or/angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆLzˆf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig −/angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆfˆLz/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =0 and therefore /parenleftbig m/prime−m/parenrightbig/angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =0 (6.43) /parenleftbig using the hermiticity of ˆLz/parenrightbig . Equation 6.43 says that the matrix elements of a scalar operator vanish unless m/prime−m≡/Delta1m=0. Repeating this procedure with Equation 6.42 we get 25Importantly, they satisfy Equations 4.118 and4.120 .256 CHAPTER 6 Symmetries & Conservation Laws /angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/bracketleftBig ˆL2,ˆf/bracketrightBig/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =0 /angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆL2ˆf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig −/angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆfˆL2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =0 /bracketleftbig /lscript/prime/parenleftbig /lscript/prime+1/parenrightbig −/lscript(/lscript+1)/bracketrightbig/angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =0. (6.44) This tells us that the matrix elements of a scalar operator vanish unless /lscript/prime−/lscript≡/Delta1/lscript=0.26 These, then, are the selection rules for a scalar operator: /Delta1/lscript=0 and/Delta1m=0. However, we can get even more information about the matrix elements from the remaining commutators: (I’ll just do the +case and leave the −case for Problem 6.20) /angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/bracketleftBig ˆL+,ˆf/bracketrightBig/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =0 /angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆL+ˆf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig −/angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆfˆL+/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =0 Bm/prime /lscript/prime/angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/prime/parenleftbig m/prime−1/parenrightbig/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig −Am /lscript/angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscript(m+1)/angbracketrightBig =0, (6.45) where (from Problem 4.21) Am /lscript=/planckover2pi1/radicalbig /lscript(/lscript+1)−m(m+1), and Bm /lscript=/planckover2pi1/radicalbig /lscript(/lscript+1)−m(m−1). (I also used the fact that ˆL±is the Hermitian conjugate of ˆL∓:/angbracketleftψ|ˆL±=/angbracketleftL∓ψ|.)27Both terms in Equation 6.45 are zero unless m/prime=m+1 and/lscript/prime=/lscript, as we proved in Equations 6.43 and6.44. When these conditions are satisﬁed, the two coefﬁcients are equal/parenleftBig Bm+1 /lscript=Am /lscript/parenrightBig and Equation 6.45 reduces to /angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscriptm/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript(m+1)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscript(m+1)/angbracketrightBig . (6.46) Evidently the matrix elements of a scalar operator are independent of m. The results of this section can be summarized as follows: /angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆf/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =δ/lscript/lscript/primeδmm/prime/angbracketleftbig n/prime/lscript/vextenddouble/vextenddoublef/vextenddouble/vextenddoublen/lscript/angbracketrightbig .

This is signiﬁcantly more work than the scalar case, but the result is central to understanding atomic transitions (Chapter 11). We begin by deﬁning, by analogy with the angular momentum raising and lowering operators, the operators28 ˆV±≡ˆVx±iˆVy. Written in terms of these operators, Equation 6.33 becomes /bracketleftBig ˆLz,ˆVz/bracketrightBig =0 (6.50) /bracketleftBig ˆLz,ˆV±/bracketrightBig =±/planckover2pi1ˆV± (6.51) /bracketleftBig ˆL±,ˆV±/bracketrightBig =0 (6.52) /bracketleftBig ˆL±,ˆVz/bracketrightBig =∓/planckover2pi1ˆV± (6.53) /bracketleftBig ˆL±,ˆV∓/bracketrightBig =± 2/planckover2pi1ˆVz (6.54) as you will show in Problem 6.22(a).29Just as for the scalar operator in Section 6.7.1 ,w e sandwich each of these commutators between two states of deﬁnite angular momentum to derive (a) conditions under which the matrix elements are guaranteed to vanish and (b) relations between matrix elements with differing values of mor different components of ˆV. From Equation 6.51, /angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆLzˆV±/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig −/angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆV±ˆLz/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =±/planckover2pi1/angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆV±/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig , 28The operators ˆV±are, up to constants, components of what are known as spherical tensor operators of rank 1, writtenˆT(k) qwhere kis the rank and qthe component of the operator: ˆT(1) ±1=∓1√ 2ˆV±ˆT(1) 0=ˆVz. Similarly, the scalar operator ftreated in Section 6.7.1 is a rank-0 spherical tensor operator: ˆT(0) 0=ˆf. 29Equations 6.51–6.54 each stand for twoequations: read the upper signs all the way across, or the lower signs.6.7 Rotational Selection Rules 259 and since our states are eigenstates of ˆLz, this simpliﬁes to /bracketleftbig m/prime−(m±1)/bracketrightbig/angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆV±/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =0. (6.55) Equation 6.55 says that either m/prime=m±1, or else the matrix element of ˆV±must vanish. Equation 6.50 works out similarly (see Problem 6.22) and this ﬁrst set of commutators gives us the selection rules for m: /angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆV+/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =0 unless m/prime=m+1 (6.56) /angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆVz/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =0 unless m/prime=m (6.57) /angbracketleftBig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆV−/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightBig =0 unless m/prime=m−1.

In particular, the matrix elements of any component of a vector operator, /angbracketleftn/prime/lscript/primem/prime|ˆVi|n/lscriptm/angbracketright, are nonzero only if /Delta1/lscript=0,±1, and/Delta1m=0,±1.

It is no coincidence that the Clebsch–Gordan coefﬁcients appear in Equations 6.59–6.61. States have angular momentum, but operators also carry angular momentum. A scalar operator (Equation 6.34) has/lscript=0—it is unchanged by a rotation—just as a state of angular momentum 0 is unchanged. A vector operator (Equation 6.33) has/lscript=1; its three components transform into each other under a rotation in the same way the triplet of states with angular momentum /lscript=1 transform into each other.31When we act on a state with an operator, we add together the angular momentum of the state and the operator to obtain the angular momentum of the resul- tant state; this addition of angular momenta is the source of the Clebsch–Gordan coefﬁcients in Equations 6.59–6.61.32 ∗ Problem 6.22 (a)Show that the commutation relations, Equations 6.50–6.54, follow from the def- inition of a vector operator, Equation 6.33.

Note:t h i s is the expectation value of a vector so you need to compute all three components. Don’t forget Laporte’s rule! 6.8 TRANSLATIONS IN TIME In this section we study time-translation invariance. Consider a solution /Psi1(x,t)to the time- dependent Schrödinger equation ˆH/Psi1(x,t)=i/planckover2pi1∂ ∂t/Psi1(x,t). We can deﬁne the operator that propagates the wave function forward in time, ˆU(t)by ˆU(t)/Psi1(x,0)=/Psi1(x,t); (6.67)6.8 Translations in Time 263 ˆU(t)can be expressed in terms of the Hamiltonian, and doing so is straightforward if the Hamiltonian is not itself a function of time. In that case, expanding the right-hand side of Equation 6.67 in a Taylor series gives33 ˆU(t)/Psi1(x,0)=/Psi1(x,t)=∞/summationdisplay n=01 n!∂n ∂tn/Psi1(x,t)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle t=0tn(6.68) =∞/summationdisplay n=01 n!/parenleftbigg −i /planckover2pi1ˆHt/parenrightbiggn /Psi1(x,0). (6.69) Therefore, in the case of a time-independent Hamiltonian, the time-evolution operator is34 ˆU(t)=exp/bracketleftbigg −it /planckover2pi1ˆH/bracketrightbigg . (6.71) We say that the Hamiltonian is the generator of translations in time . Note thatˆU(t)is a unitary operator (see Problem 6.2). The time-evolution operator offers a compact way to state the procedure for solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. To see the correspondence, write out the wave function at time t=0 as a superposition of stationary states/parenleftBig ˆHψn=Enψn/parenrightBig : /Psi1(x,0)=/summationdisplay ncnψn(x). Then /Psi1(x,t)=ˆU(t)/Psi1(x,0)=/summationdisplay ncnˆU(t)ψn(x) =/summationdisplay ncne−iˆHt//planckover2pi1ψn(x)=/summationdisplay ncne−iEnt//planckover2pi1ψn(x). In this sense Equation 6.71 is shorthand for the process of expanding the initial wave func- tion in terms of stationary states and then tacking on the “wiggle factors” to obtain the wave function at a later time (Section 2.1). 33Why is this analysis limited to the case where ˆHis independent of time? Whether or not ˆHdepends on time, Schrödinger’s equation says i/planckover2pi1˙/Psi1=ˆH/Psi1.H o w e v e r ,i f ˆHis time dependent then the second derivative of /Psi1is given by ∂2 ∂t2/Psi1=∂ ∂t/parenleftbigg1 i/planckover2pi1ˆH/Psi1/parenrightbigg =1 i/planckover2pi1∂ˆH ∂t/Psi1−1 /planckover2pi12ˆH2/Psi1 and higher derivatives will be even more complicated. Therefore, Equation 6.69 only follows from Equation 6.68 whenˆHhas no time dependence. See also Problem 11.23 . 34This derivation assumes that the actual solution to Schrodinger’s equation, /Psi1(x,t), can be expanded as a Taylor series in t, and nothing guarantees that. B. R. Holstein and A. R. Swift, A. J. Phys. 40, 829 (1989) give an innocent- seeming example where such an expansion does not exist. Nonetheless, Equation 6.71 still holds in such cases as long as we deﬁne the exponential function through its spectral decomposition (Equation 3.103 ): ˆU(t)≡/summationdisplay ne−iEnt//planckover2pi1|ψn/angbracketright/angbracketleftψn|. (6.70) See also M. Amaku et al., Am. J. Phys. 85, 692 (2017).264 CHAPTER 6 Symmetries & Conservation Laws 6.8.1 The Heisenberg Picture Just as for the other transformations studied in this chapter, we can examine the effect of apply- ing time translation to operators , as well as to wave functions. The transformed operators are called Heisenberg-picture operators and we follow the convention of giving them a subscript Hrather than a prime: ˆQH(t)=ˆU†(t)ˆQˆU(t). (6.72) Example 6.6 A particle of mass mmoves in one dimension in a potential V(x): ˆH=ˆp2 2m+V(x). Find the position operator in the Heisenberg picture for an inﬁnitesimal time translation δ. Solution : From Equation 6.71, ˆU(δ)≈1−iδ /planckover2pi1ˆH. Applying Equation 6.72,w eh a v e ˆxH(δ)≈/parenleftbigg 1+iδ /planckover2pi1ˆH†/parenrightbigg ˆx/parenleftbigg 1−iδ /planckover2pi1ˆH/parenrightbigg ≈ˆx−iδ /planckover2pi1/bracketleftBig ˆx,ˆH/bracketrightBig ≈ˆx−iδ /planckover2pi1i/planckover2pi1ˆp m so ˆxH(δ)≈ˆxH(0)+1 mˆpH(0)δ (making use of the fact that the Heisenberg-picture operators at time 0 are just the untrans- formed operators). This looks exactly like classical mechanics: x(δ)≈x(0)+v(0)δ.T h e Heisenberg picture illuminates the connection between classical and quantum mechanics: the quantum operators obey the classical equations of motion (see Problem 6.29). Example 6.7 A particle of mass mmoves in one dimension in a harmonic-oscillator potential: ˆH=ˆp2 2m+1 2mω2x2. Find the position operator in the Heisenberg picture at time t. Solution : Consider the action of ˆxHon a stationary state ψn. (Introducingψnallows us to replace the operator e−iˆHt//planckover2pi1with the number e−iEnt//planckover2pi1, since e−iˆHt//planckover2pi1ψn= e−iEnt//planckover2pi1ψn.) Writingˆxin terms of raising and lowering operators we have (using Equations 2.62,2.67, and 2.70) ˆxH(t)ψn(x)=ˆU†(t)ˆxˆU(t)ψn(x) =eiˆHt//planckover2pi1/radicalbigg /planckover2pi1 2mω/parenleftbig ˆa++ˆa−/parenrightbig e−iˆHt//planckover2pi1ψn(x)6.8 Translations in Time 265 =/radicalbigg /planckover2pi1 2mωe−iEnt//planckover2pi1eiˆHt//planckover2pi1/parenleftbig ˆa++ˆa−/parenrightbig ψn(x) =/radicalbigg /planckover2pi1 2mωe−iEnt//planckover2pi1eiˆHt//planckover2pi1/bracketleftBig√ n+1ψn+1(x)+√nψn−1(x)/bracketrightBig =/radicalbigg /planckover2pi1 2mωe−iEnt//planckover2pi1/bracketleftBig√ n+1eiEn+1t//planckover2pi1ψn+1(x) +√neiEn−1t//planckover2pi1ψn−1(x)/bracketrightBig =/radicalbigg /planckover2pi1 2mω/bracketleftBig√ n+1eiωtψn+1(x)+√ne−iωtψn−1(x)/bracketrightBig . (6.73) Thus35 ˆxH(t)=/radicalbigg /planckover2pi1 2mω/bracketleftBig eiωtˆa++e−iωtˆa−/bracketrightBig . Or, using Equation 2.48 to expressˆa±in terms ofˆxandˆp, ˆxH(t)=ˆxH(0)cos(ωt)+1 mωˆpH(0)sin(ωt). (6.74) As in Example 6.6we see that the Heisenberg-picture operator satisﬁes the classical equation of motion for a mass on a spring. In this book we have been working in the Schrödinger picture , so-named by Dirac because it was the picture that Schrödinger himself had in mind. In the Schrödinger picture, the wave function evolves in time according to the Schrödinger equation ˆH/Psi1(x,t)=i/planckover2pi1∂ ∂t/Psi1(x,t). The operators ˆx=xandˆp=− i/planckover2pi1∂xhave no time dependence of their own, and the time dependence of expectation values (or, more generally, matrix elements) comes from the time dependence of the wave function:36 /angbracketleftBig ˆQ/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig /Psi1(t)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/Psi1(t)/angbracketrightBig . In the Heisenberg picture, the wave function is constant in time, /Psi1H(x)=/Psi1(x,0), and theoperators evolve in time according to Equation 6.72. In the Heisenberg picture, the time dependence of expectation values (or matrix elements) is carried by the operators . /angbracketleftBig ˆQ/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig /Psi1H/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQH(t)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/Psi1H/angbracketrightBig . Of course, the two pictures are entirely equivalent since /angbracketleftBig /Psi1(t)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/Psi1(t)/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig /Psi1(0)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆU†ˆQˆU/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/Psi1(0)/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig /Psi1H/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆQH(t)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/Psi1H/angbracketrightBig . 35Since Equation 6.73 holds for anystationary state ψnand since theψnconstitute a complete set of states, the operators must in fact be identical. 36I am assuming that ˆQ, likeˆxorˆp,h a sn o explicit time dependence.266 CHAPTER 6 Symmetries & Conservation Laws A nice analogy for the two pictures runs as follows. On an ordinary clock, the hands move in a clockwise direction while the numbers stay ﬁxed. But one could equally well design a clock where the hands are stationary and the numbers move in the counter-clockwise direc- tion. The correspondence between these two clocks is roughly the correspondence between the Schrödinger and Heisenberg pictures, the hands representing the wave function and the num- bers representing the operator. Other pictures could be introduced as well, in which both the hands of the clock and the numbers on the dial move at intermediate rates such that the clock still tells the correct time.37 ∗ Problem 6.26 Work outˆpH(t)for the system in Example 6.7and comment on the correspondence with the classical equation of motion. ∗∗ Problem 6.27 Consider a free particle of mass m. Show that the position and momentum operators in the Heisenberg picture are given by ˆxH(t)=ˆxH(0)+1 mˆpH(0)t ˆpH(t)=ˆpH(0). Comment on the relationship between these equations and the classical equations of motion. Hint: you will ﬁrst need to evaluate the commutator/bracketleftBig ˆx,ˆHn/bracketrightBig ; this will allow you to evaluate the commutator/bracketleftBig ˆx,ˆU/bracketrightBig . 6.8.2 Time-Translation Invariance If the Hamiltonian is time- dependent one can still write the formal solution to the Schrödinger equation in terms of the time-translation operator, ˆU: /Psi1(x,t)=ˆU(t,t0)/Psi1(x,t0), (6.75) butˆUno longer takes the simple form 6.71.38(See Problem 11.23 for the general case.) For an inﬁnitesimal time interval δ(see Problem 6.28) ˆU(t0+δ,t0)≈1−i /planckover2pi1ˆH(t0)δ. (6.76) Time-translation invariance means that the time evolution is independent of which time interval we are considering. In other words ˆU(t1+δ,t1)=ˆU(t2+δ,t2) (6.77) for any choice of t1andt2. This ensures that if the system starts in state |α/angbracketrightat time t1and evolves for a time δthen it will end up in the same state |β/angbracketrightas if the system started in the same state|α/angbracketrightat time t2and evolved for the same amount of time δ; i.e. the experiment proceeds the same on Thursday as it did on Tuesday, assuming identical conditions. Plugging Equation 6.76 into Equation 6.77 we see that the requirement for this to be true is ˆH(t1)=ˆH(t2), and since 37Of these other possible pictures the most important is the interaction picture (or Dirac picture) which is often employed in time-dependent perturbation theory. 38And is a function of both the initial time t0and the ﬁnal time t, not simply the amount of time for which the wave function has evolved.6.8 Translations in Time 267 this must hold true for all t1andt2, it must be that the Hamiltonian is in fact time-independent after all (for time-translation invariance to hold): ∂ˆH ∂t=0. In that case the generalized Ehrenfest theorem says d dt/angbracketleftBig ˆH/angbracketrightBig =i /planckover2pi1/angbracketleftBig/bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆH/bracketrightBig/angbracketrightBig +/angbracketleftBigg ∂ˆH ∂t/angbracketrightBigg =0. Therefore, energy conservation is a consequence of time-translation invariance . We have now recovered all the classical conservation laws: conservation of momentum, energy, and angular momentum, and seen that they are each related to a continuous symmetry of the Hamiltonian (spatial translation, time translation, and rotation, respectively). And in quantum mechanics, discrete symmetries (such as parity) can also lead to conservation laws.

The fact that ψ+andψ−are not connected to each other by any symmetry of the square means that there must be additional symmetry explaining the degeneracy of these two states.42 ∗∗∗ Problem 6.34 The Coulomb potential has more symmetry than simply rotational invari- ance. This additional symmetry is manifest in an additional conserved quantity, the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector ˆM=ˆp×ˆL−ˆL×ˆp 2m+V(r)r, where V(r)is the potential energy, V(r)=− e2/4π/epsilon10r.43The complete set of commutators for the conserved quantities in the hydrogen atom is (i)/bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆMi/bracketrightBig =0 (ii)/bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆLi/bracketrightBig =0 (iii)/bracketleftBig ˆLi,ˆLj/bracketrightBig =i/planckover2pi1/epsilon1ijkˆLk (iv)/bracketleftBig ˆLi,ˆMj/bracketrightBig =i/planckover2pi1/epsilon1ijkˆMk (v)/bracketleftBig ˆMi,ˆMj/bracketrightBig =/planckover2pi1 i/epsilon1ijkLk2 mˆH.

Problem 6.36 A ball thrown through the air leaves your hand at position r0with a velocity ofv0and arrives a time tlater at position r1traveling with a velocity v1(Figure 6.10). Suppose we could instantaneously reverse the ball’s velocity when it reaches r1. Neglecting air resistance, it would retrace the path that took it from r0tor1and arrive back at r0after another time thad passed, traveling with a velocity −v0.T h i si sa n example of time-reversal invariance —reverse the motion of a particle at any point along its trajectory and it will retrace its path with an equal and opposite velocity at all positions. Why is this called time reversal? After all, it was the velocity that was reversed, not time. Well, if we showed you a movie of the ball traveling from r1tor0, there would be no way to tell if you were watching a movie of the ball after the reversal playing forward, or a movie of the ball before the reversal playing backward. In a time-reversal invariant system, playing the movie backwards represents another possible motion.Further Problems on Chapter 6 273 υ0υ1 xy xy −υ1 −υ0 Figure 6.10: A ball thrown through the air (ignore air resistance) is an example of a system with time-reversal symmetry. If we ﬂip the velocity of the particle at any point along its trajectory, it will retrace its path. A familiar example of a system that does notexhibit time-reversal symmetry is a charged particle moving in an external magnetic ﬁeld.44In that case, when you reverse the velocity of the particle, the Lorentz force will also change sign and the particle will not retrace its path; this is illustrated in Figure 6.11. υ0υ1 −υ1 xy xy Figure 6.11: An external magnetic ﬁeld breaks time-reversal symmetry. Shown is the trajectory of a particle of charge +qtraveling in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld pointing into the page. If we ﬂip the particle’s velocity from v1to−v1at the point shown, the particle does not retrace its path, but instead moves onto a new circular orbit. 44By external magnetic ﬁeld, I mean that we we only reverse the velocity of our charge q, and not the velocities of the charges producing the magnetic ﬁeld. If we reversed those velocities as well, the magnetic ﬁeld would also switch directions, the Lorentz force on the charge qwould be unchanged by the reversal, and the system would in fact be time-reversal invariant.274 CHAPTER 6 Symmetries & Conservation Laws The time-reversal operator ˆ/Theta1is the operator that reverses the momentum of the particle(p→− p), leaving its position unchanged. A better name would really be the “reversal of the direction of motion” operator.45For a spinless particle, the time- reversal operator ˆ/Theta1simply complex conjugates the position-space wave function46 ˆ/Theta1/Psi1(x,t)=/Psi1∗(x,t).

Hint: Do this by calculating the action of ˆx/primeandˆp/primeon an arbitrary test function f(x). (b)We can write down a mathematical statement of time-reversal invariance from our discussion above. We take a system, evolve it for a time t, reverse its momentum, and evolve it for time tagain. If the system is time-reversal invariant it will be back where it started, albeit with its momentum reversed (Figure 6.10). As an operator statement this says ˆU(t)ˆ/Theta1ˆU(t)=ˆ/Theta1. If this is to hold for any time interval, it must hold in particular for an inﬁnitesimal time intervalδ. Show that time-reversal invariance requires /bracketleftBig ˆ/Theta1,ˆH/bracketrightBig =0. (6.83) (c)Show that, for a time-reversal invariant Hamiltonian, if ψn(x)is a stationary state with energy En, thenψ∗ n(x)is also a stationary state with the same energy En.I f the energy is nondegenerate, this means that the stationary state can be chosen as real. (d)What do you get by time-reversing a momentum eigenfunction fp(x)(Equa- tion 3.32)? How about a hydrogen wave function ψn/lscriptm(r,θ,φ)? Comment on each state’s relation to the untransformed state and verify that the transformed and untransformed states share the same energy, as guaranteed by (c). Problem 6.37 As an angular momentum, a particle’s spin must ﬂip under time reversal (Problem 6.36). The action of time-reversal on a spinor (Section 4.4.1 ) is in fact 45See Eugene P. Wigner, Group Theory and its Applications to Quantum Mechanics and Atomic Spectra (Academic Press, New York, 1959), p. 325. 46Time reversal is an anti-unitary operator . An anti-unitary operator satisﬁes /angbracketleft/Theta1f|/Theta1g/angbracketright=/angbracketleftf|g/angbracketright∗ ˆ/Theta1(a|α/angbracketright+b|β/angbracketright)=a∗ˆ/Theta1|α/angbracketright+b∗ˆ/Theta1|β/angbracketright whereas a unitary operator satisﬁes the same two equations without the complex conjugates. I won’t deﬁne the adjoint of an anti-unitary operator; instead I use ˆ/Theta1−1for an anti-unitary operator where we might have used ˆU† orˆU−1interchangeably for a unitary operator.Further Problems on Chapter 6 275 ˆ/Theta1/parenleftbigga b/parenrightbigg =/parenleftbigg−b∗ a∗/parenrightbigg (6.84) so that, in addition to the complex conjugation, the up and down components are interchanged.47 (a)Show thatˆ/Theta12=−1 for a spin-1/2 particle.

There two possibilities: either |ψ/prime n/angbracketrightand|ψn/angbracketrightare thesame state (meaning |ψ/prime n/angbracketright=c|ψn/angbracketrightfor some complex constant c)or they are distinct states. Show that the ﬁrst case leads to a contradiction in the case of a spin-1/2 particle, meaning the energy level must be (at least) two-fold degenerate in that case. Comment : What you have proved is a special case of Kramer’s degeneracy : for an odd number of spin-1 /2 particles (or any half-integer spin for that matter), every energy level (of a time-reversal-invariant Hamiltonian) is at least two-fold degen- erate. This is because—as you just showed—for half-integer spin a state and its time-reversed state are necessarily distinct.48 47For arbitrary spin, ˆ/Theta1=e−iπˆSy//planckover2pi1ˆK (6.85) where the ﬁrst term is a rotation by πabout the yaxis andˆKis the operator that performs the complex conjugation. 48What about in the case of a spin-0 particle—does time-reversal symmetry tell us anything interesting? Actually it does. For one thing, the stationary states can be chosen as real; you proved this back in Problem 2.2but we now see that it is a consequence of time-reversal symmetry. Another example is the degeneracy of the energy levels in a periodical potential (Section 5.3.2 and Problem 6.6) for states with crystal momentum qand−q. This can be ascribed to inversion symmetry if the potential is symmetric, but the degeneracy persists even when inversion symmetry is absent (try it out!); that is a result of time-reversal symmetry.P a r t I I A p p l i c a t i o n s ◈7TIME-INDEPENDENT PERTURBATION THEORY 7.1 NONDEGENERATE PERTURBATION THEORY 7.1.1 General Formulation Suppose we have solved the (time-independent) Schrödinger equation for some potential (say, the one-dimensional inﬁnite square well): H0ψ0 n=E0 nψ0 n, (7.1) obtaining a complete set of orthonormal eigenfunctions, ψ0 n, /angbracketleftBig ψ0 n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 m/angbracketrightBig =δnm, (7.2) and the corresponding eigenvalues E0 n. Now we perturb the potential slightly (say, by putting a little bump in the bottom of the well—Figure 7.1). We’d liketo ﬁnd the new eigenfunctions and eigenvalues: Hψn=Enψn, (7.3) but unless we are very lucky, we’re not going to be able to solve the Schrödinger equation exactly, for this more complicated potential. Perturbation theory is a systematic procedure for obtaining approximate solutions to the perturbed problem, by building on the known exact solutions to the unperturbed case. To begin with we write the new Hamiltonian as the sum of two terms: H=H0+λH/prime, (7.4) where H/primeis the perturbation (the superscript 0 always identiﬁes the unperturbed quantity). For the moment we’ll take λto be a small number; later we’ll crank it up to 1, and Hwill be the true Hamiltonian. Next we write ψnandEnas power series in λ: ψn=ψ0 n+λψ1 n+λ2ψ2 n+···; (7.5) En=E0 n+λE1 n+λ2E2 n+···. (7.6) Here E1 nis the ﬁrst-order correction to the nth eigenvalue, and ψ1 nis the ﬁrst-order correction to the nth eigenfunction; E2 nandψ2 nare the second-order corrections , and so on.

(I’m done with λ, now—it was just a device to keep track of the different orders—so crank it up to 1.) 7.1.2 First-Order Theory Taking the inner product of Equation 7.7withψ0 n(that is, multiplying by/parenleftbig ψ0 n/parenrightbig∗and integrating), /angbracketleftBig ψ0 n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH0ψ1 n/angbracketrightBig +/angbracketleftBig ψ0 n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/primeψ0 n/angbracketrightBig =E0 n/angbracketleftBig ψ0 n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ1 n/angbracketrightBig +E1 n/angbracketleftBig ψ0 n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 n/angbracketrightBig .

Moreover, /angbracketleftψ0 n|ψ0 n/angbracketright=1, so2 E1 n=/angbracketleftBig ψ0 n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 n/angbracketrightBig . (7.9) This is the fundamental result of ﬁrst-order perturbation theory; as a practical matter, it may well be the most frequently used equation in quantum mechanics. It says that the ﬁrst-order correction to the energy is the expectation value of the perturbation, in the unperturbed state. Example 7.1 The unperturbed wave functions for the inﬁnite square well are (Equation 2.31) ψ0 n(x)=/radicalbigg 2 asin/parenleftBignπ ax/parenrightBig . Suppose we perturb the system by simply raising the “ﬂoor” of the well a constant amount V0(Figure 7.2). Find the ﬁrst-order correction to the energies. axV(x) V0 Figure 7.2: Constant perturbation over the whole well. Solution: In this case H/prime=V0, and the ﬁrst-order correction to the energy of the nth state is E1 n=/angbracketleftBig ψ0 n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleV0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 n/angbracketrightBig =V0/angbracketleftBig ψ0 n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 n/angbracketrightBig =V0. The corrected energy levels, then, are En≈E0 n+V0; they are simply lifted by the amount V0.O f course! The only surprising thing is that in this case the ﬁrst-order theory yields theexact answer. Evidently for a constant perturbation all the higher corrections vanish.3 2In this context it doesn’t matter whether we write /angbracketleftψ0n|H/primeψ0n/angbracketrightor/angbracketleftψ0n|H/prime|ψ0n/angbracketright(with the extra vertical bar), because we are using the wave function itself to label the state. But the latter notation is preferable, because it frees us from this convention. For instance, if we used |n/angbracketrightto denote the nth state of the harmonic oscillator (Equation 2.86),H/prime|n/angbracketright makes sense, but |H/primen/angbracketrightis unintelligible (operators act on vectors /functions, not on numbers ). 3Incidentally, nothing here depends on the speciﬁc nature of the inﬁnite square well—the same holds for any potential, when the perturbation is a constant.282 CHAPTER 7 Time-Independent Perturbation Theory On the other hand, if the perturbation extends only half-way across the well (Figure 7.3), then E1 n=2V0 a/integraldisplaya/2 0sin2/parenleftBignπ ax/parenrightBig dx=V0 In this case every energy level is lifted by V0/2. That’s not the exact result, presumably, but it does seem reasonable, as a ﬁrst-order approximation. axV(x) V0 a 2 Figure 7.3: Constant perturbation over half the well. Equation 7.9is the ﬁrst-order correction to the energy ; to ﬁnd the ﬁrst-order correction to thewave function we rewrite Equation 7.7: /parenleftBig H0−E0 n/parenrightBig ψ1 n=−/parenleftBig H/prime−E1 n/parenrightBig ψ0 n. (7.10) The right side is a known function, so this amounts to an inhomogeneous differential equation forψ1 n. Now, the unperturbed wave functions constitute a complete set, so ψ1 n(like any other function) can be expressed as a linear combination of them: ψ1 n=/summationdisplay m/negationslash=nc(n) mψ0 m. (7.11) (There is no need to include m=nin the sum, for if ψ1 nsatisﬁes Equation 7.10, so too does (ψ1 n+αψ0 n), for any constant α, and we can use this freedom to subtract off the ψ0 nterm.4)I f we could determine the coefﬁcients c(n) m, we’d be done. 4Alternatively, a glance at Equation 7.5reveals that any ψ0ncomponent inψ1nmight as well be pulled out and combined with the ﬁrst term. In fact, the choice c(n) n=0 ensures thatψn—with 1 as the coefﬁcient of ψ0nin Equation 7.5—is normalized (to ﬁrst order in λ):/angbracketleftψn|ψn/angbracketright=/angbracketleftψ0n|ψ0n/angbracketright+λ/parenleftbig /angbracketleftψ1n|ψ0n/angbracketright+/angbracketleftψ0n|ψ1n/angbracketright/parenrightbig +λ2(···)+···, but the orthonormality of the unperturbed states means that the ﬁrst term is 1 and /angbracketleftψ1n|ψ0n/angbracketright=/angbracketleftψ0n|ψ1n/angbracketright=0, as long asψ1nhas noψ0ncomponent.7.1 Nondegenerate Perturbation Theory 283 Well, putting Equation 7.11 into Equation 7.10, and using the fact that ψ0 msatisﬁes the unperturbed Schrödinger equation (Equation 7.1), we have /summationdisplay m/negationslash=n/parenleftBig E0 m−E0 n/parenrightBig c(n) mψ0 m=−/parenleftBig H/prime−E1 n/parenrightBig ψ0 n.

Ifl=n, the left side is zero, and we recover Equation 7.9;i fl/negationslash=n, we get /parenleftBig E0 l−E0 n/parenrightBig c(n) l=−/angbracketleftBig ψ0 l/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 n/angbracketrightBig , or c(n) m=/angbracketleftbig ψ0 m/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 n/angbracketrightbig E0n−E0m, (7.12) so ψ1 n=/summationdisplay m/negationslash=n/angbracketleftbig ψ0 m/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 n/angbracketrightbig /parenleftbig E0n−E0m/parenrightbigψ0 m. (7.13) Notice that the denominator is safe (since there is no coefﬁcient with m=n)as long as the unperturbed energy spectrum is nondegenerate . But if two different unperturbed states share the same energy, we’re in serious trouble (we divided by zero to get Equa- tion 7.12); in that case we need degenerate perturbation theory , which I’ll come to in Section 7.2. That completes ﬁrst-order perturbation theory: The ﬁrst-order correction to the energy, E1 n, is given by Equation 7.9, and the ﬁrst-order correction to the wave function, ψ1 n, is given by Equation 7.13. ∗ Problem 7.1 Suppose we put a delta-function bump in the center of the inﬁnite square well: H/prime=αδ(x−a/2), whereαis a constant.

Problem 7.3 Two identical spin-zero bosons are placed in an inﬁnite square well (Equation 2.22). They interact weakly with one another, via the potential V(x1,x2)=−aV0δ(x1−x2) (where V0is a constant with the dimensions of energy, and ais the width of the well). (a)First, ignoring the interaction between the particles, ﬁnd the ground state and the ﬁrst excited state—both the wave functions and the associated energies. (b)Use ﬁrst-order perturbation theory to estimate the effect of the particle–particle interaction on the energies of the ground state and the ﬁrst excited state. 7.1.3 Second-Order Energies Proceeding as before, we take the inner product of the second -order equation (Equation 7.8) withψ0 n: /angbracketleftBig ψ0 n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH0ψ2 n/angbracketrightBig +/angbracketleftBig ψ0 n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/primeψ1 n/angbracketrightBig =E0 n/angbracketleftBig ψ0 n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ2 n/angbracketrightBig +E1 n/angbracketleftBig ψ0 n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ1 n/angbracketrightBig +E2 n/angbracketleftBig ψ0 n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 n/angbracketrightBig .

Meanwhile, /angbracketleftψ0 n|ψ0 n/angbracketright=1, and we are left with a formula for E2 n: E2 n=/angbracketleftBig ψ0 n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ1 n/angbracketrightBig −E1 n/angbracketleftBig ψ0 n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ1 n/angbracketrightBig .

(7.15) This is the fundamental result of second-order perturbation theory.7.1 Nondegenerate Perturbation Theory 285 We could go on to calculate the second-order correction to the wave function/parenleftbig ψ2 n/parenrightbig ,t h e third-order correction to the energy, and so on, but in practice Equation 7.15 is ordinarily as far as it is useful to pursue this method.5 ∗∗ Problem 7.4 Apply perturbation theory to the most general two-level system. The unper- turbed Hamiltonian is H0=/parenleftbiggE0 a0 0 E0 b/parenrightbigg and the perturbation is H/prime=λ/parenleftbiggVaa Vab Vba Vbb/parenrightbigg with Vba=V∗ ab,VaaandVbbreal, so that His hermitian.

Verify that the terms in the series agree with the results from perturbation theory in Sections 7.1.2 and7.1.3 . Assume that Eb>Ea. (c)Setting Vaa=Vbb=0, show that the series in (b) only converges if /vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleVab E0 b−E0a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle<1 Comment : In general, perturbation theory is only valid if the matrix elements of the perturbation are small compared to the energy level spacings. Otherwise, the ﬁrst few terms (which are all we ever calculate) will give a poor approximation to the quantity of interest and, as shown here, the series may fail to converge at all, in which case the ﬁrst few terms tell us nothing. ∗ Problem 7.5 (a)Find the second-order correction to the energies/parenleftbig E2 n/parenrightbig for the potential in Prob- lem7.1.Comment: You can sum the series explicitly, obtaining −2m(α/π/planckover2pi1n)2for oddn. 5In the short-hand notation Vmn≡/angbracketleftψ0m|H/prime|ψ0n/angbracketright,/Delta1mn≡E0m−E0n, the ﬁrst three corrections to the nth energy are E1 n=Vnn,E2 n=/summationdisplay m/negationslash=n|Vnm|2 /Delta1nm,E3 n=/summationdisplay l,m/negationslash=nVnlVlmVmn /Delta1nl/Delta1nm−Vnn/summationdisplay m/negationslash=n|Vnm|2 /Delta12nm. The third-order correction is given in Landau and Lifschitz, Quantum Mechanics: Non-Relativistic Theory , 3rd edn, Pergamon, Oxford (1977), page 136; the fourth and ﬁfth orders (together with a powerful general technique for obtaining the higher orders) are developed by Nicholas Wheeler, Higher-Order Spectral Perturbation (unpublished Reed College report, 2000). Illuminating alternative formulations of time-independent perturbation theory include the Dalgarno–Lewis method and the closely related “logarithmic” perturbation theory (see, for example, T. Imbo and U. Sukhatme, Am. J. Phys. 52, 140 (1984), for LPT, and H. Mavromatis, A m .J .P h y s . 59, 738 (1991), for Delgarno–Lewis).286 CHAPTER 7 Time-Independent Perturbation Theory (b)Calculate the second-order correction to the ground state energy/parenleftbig E2 0/parenrightbig for the potential in Problem 7.2.

(c)Make a single plot showing (i) the unperturbed ground-state wave function, (ii) the numerical ground-state wave function, and (ii) the ﬁrst-order approximation to the ground-state wave function. Note: Make sure you’ve properly normalized your numerical result, 1=/integraldisplay |ψ(x)|2dx≈N/summationdisplay i=1|ψi|2/Delta1x. 7.2 DEGENERATE PERTURBATION THEORY If the unperturbed states are degenerate—that is, if two (or more) distinct states (ψ0 aandψ0 b) share the same energy—then ordinary perturbation theory fails: c(b) a(Equation 7.12) and E2 a (Equation 7.15) blow up (unless, perhaps, the numerator vanishes,/angbracketleftbig ψ0 a/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 b/angbracketrightbig =0—a loop- hole that will be important to us later on). In the degenerate case, therefore, there is no reason to trust even the ﬁrst-order correction to the energy (Equation 7.9), and we must look for some other way to handle the problem. Note this is nota minor problem; almost all applications of perturbation theory involve degeneracy. 7.2.1 Two-Fold Degeneracy Suppose that H0ψ0 a=E0ψ0 a,H0ψ0 b=E0ψ0 b,/angbracketleftBig ψ0 a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 b/angbracketrightBig =0, (7.16)7.2 Degenerate Perturbation Theory 287 E E0 λ 1 Figure 7.4: “Lifting” of a degeneracy by a perturbation. withψ0 aandψ0 bboth normalized. Note that any linear combination of these states, ψ0=αψ0 a+βψ0 b, (7.17) is still an eigenstate of H0, with the same eigenvalue E0: H0ψ0=E0ψ0. (7.18) Typically, the perturbation/parenleftbig H/prime/parenrightbig will “break” (or “lift”) the degeneracy: As we increase λ (from 0 to 1), the common unperturbed energy E0splits into two (Figure 7.4). Going the other direction, when we turn offthe perturbation, the “upper” state reduces down to one linear combination of ψ0 aandψ0 b, and the “lower” state reduces to some (orthogonal) linear combination, but we don’t know a priori what these “ good ” linear combinations will be. For this reason we can’t even calculate the ﬁrst-order energy (Equation 7.9)—we don’t know what unperturbed states to use. The “good” states are deﬁned as the limit of the true eigenstates as the perturbation is switched off(λ→0)but that isn’t how you ﬁnd them in realistic situations (if you knew the exact eigenstates you wouldn’t need perturbation theory). Before I show you the practical techniques for calculating them, we’ll look at an example where we can take the λ→0 limit of the exact eigenstates. Example 7.2 Consider a particle of mass min a two-dimensional oscillator potential H0=p2 2m+1 2mω2/parenleftBig x2+y2/parenrightBig to which is added a perturbation H/prime=/epsilon1mω2xy. The unperturbed ﬁrst-excited state (with E0=2/planckover2pi1ω)is two-fold degenerate, and onebasis for those two degenerate states is ψ0 a=ψ0(x)ψ1(y)=/radicalbigg 2 πmω /planckover2pi1ye−mω 2/planckover2pi1/parenleftbig x2+y2/parenrightbig288 CHAPTER 7 Time-Independent Perturbation Theory ψ0 b=ψ1(x)ψ0(y)=/radicalbigg 2 πmω /planckover2pi1xe−mω 2/planckover2pi1/parenleftbig x2+y2/parenrightbig , (7.19) whereψ0andψ1refer to the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator states (Equation 2.86). To ﬁnd the “good” linear combinations, solve for the exact eigenstates of H=H0+H/prime and take their limit as /epsilon1→0.Hint: The problem can be solved by rotating coordinates x/prime=x+y√ 2y/prime=x−y√ (7.20) Solution : In terms of the rotated coordinates, the Hamiltonian is H=1 2m/parenleftbigg∂2 ∂x/prime2+∂2 ∂y/prime2/parenrightbigg +1 2m(1+/epsilon1)ω2x/prime2+1 2m(1−/epsilon1)ω2y/prime2. This amounts to two independent one-dimensional oscillators. The exact solutions are ψmn=ψ+ m/parenleftbig x/prime/parenrightbig ψ− n/parenleftbig y/prime/parenrightbig , whereψ± mare one-dimensional oscillator states with frequencies ω±=√ 1±/epsilon1ω respectively. The ﬁrst few exact energies, Emn=/parenleftbigg m+1 2/parenrightbigg /planckover2pi1ω++/parenleftbigg n+1 2/parenrightbigg /planckover2pi1ω−, (7.21) are shown in Figure 7.5. 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5123E h ω Figure 7.5: Exact energy levels as a function of /epsilon1for Example 7.2. The two states which grow out of the degenerate ﬁrst-excited states as /epsilon1is increased have m=0,n=1 (lower state) and m=1,n=0 (upper state). If we track these states back to /epsilon1=0 (in that limitω+=ω−=ω)we get lim /epsilon1→0ψ01(x)=lim /epsilon1→0ψ+ 0/parenleftbig x/prime/parenrightbig ψ− 1/parenleftbig y/prime/parenrightbig =ψ0/parenleftbiggx+y√ 2/parenrightbigg ψ1/parenleftbiggx−y√ 2/parenrightbigg =/radicalbigg 2 πmω /planckover2pi1x−y√ 2e−mω 2/planckover2pi1/parenleftbig x2+y2/parenrightbig =−ψ0 a+ψ0 b√ 2.7.2 Degenerate Perturbation Theory 289 lim /epsilon1→0ψ10(x)=ψ0 a+ψ0 b√ (7.22) Therefore the “good” states for this problem are ψ0 ±≡1√ 2/parenleftBig ψ0 b±ψ0 a/parenrightBig . (7.23) In this example we were able to ﬁnd the exact eigenstates of Hand then turn off the per- turbation to see what states they evolve from. But how do we ﬁnd the “good” states when wecan’t solve the system exactly? For the moment let’s just write the “good” unperturbed states in generic form (Equation 7.17), keepingαandβadjustable. We want to solve the Schrödinger equation, Hψ=Eψ, (7.24) with H=H0+λH/primeand E=E0+λE1+λ2E2+···,ψ=ψ0+λψ1+λ2ψ2+···. (7.25) Plugging these into Equation 7.24, and collecting like powers of λ(as before) we ﬁnd H0ψ0+λ/parenleftBig H/primeψ0+H0ψ1/parenrightBig +···= E0ψ0+λ/parenleftBig E1ψ0+E0ψ1/parenrightBig +···. ButH0ψ0=E0ψ0(Equation 7.18), so the ﬁrst terms cancel; at order λ1we have H0ψ1+H/primeψ0=E0ψ1+E1ψ0. (7.26) Taking the inner product with ψ0 a: /angbracketleftBig ψ0 a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH0ψ1/angbracketrightBig +/angbracketleftBig ψ0 a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/primeψ0/angbracketrightBig =E0/angbracketleftBig ψ0 a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ1/angbracketrightBig +E1/angbracketleftBig ψ0 a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0/angbracketrightBig . Because H0is hermitian, the ﬁrst term on the left cancels the ﬁrst term on the right. Putting in Equation 7.17, and exploiting the orthonormality condition (Equation 7.16), we obtain α/angbracketleftBig ψ0 a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 a/angbracketrightBig +β/angbracketleftBig ψ0 a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 b/angbracketrightBig =αE1, or, more compactly, αWaa+βWab=αE1, (7.27) where Wij≡/angbracketleftBig ψ0 i/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 j/angbracketrightBig .(i,j=a,b). (7.28) Similarly, the inner product with ψ0 byields αWba+βWbb=βE1. (7.29) Notice that the Ws are (in principle) known —they are just the “matrix elements” of H/prime, with respect to the unperturbed wave functions ψ0 aandψ0 b. Written in matrix form, Equations 7.27 and7.29 are/parenleftbiggWaa Wab Wba Wbb/parenrightbigg /bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright W/parenleftbiggα β/parenrightbigg =E1/parenleftbiggα β/parenrightbigg . (7.30)290 CHAPTER 7 Time-Independent Perturbation Theory The eigenvalues of the matrix Wgive the ﬁrst-order corrections to the energy/parenleftbig E1/parenrightbig and the corresponding eigenvectors tell us the coefﬁcients αandβthat determine the “good” states.6 The Appendix (Section A.5) shows how to obtain the eigenvalues of a matrix; I’ll reproduce those steps here to ﬁnd a general solution for E1. First, move all the terms in Equation 7.30 to the left-hand side. /parenleftbiggWaa−E1Wab Wba Wbb−E1/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggα β/parenrightbigg =0 (7.31) This equation only has non-trivial solutions if the matrix on the left is non-invertible—that is to say, if its determinant vanishes: /vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleWaa−E1Wab Wba Wbb−E1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=(Waa−E1)(Wbb−E1)−|Wab|2=0, (7.32) where we used the fact that Wba=W∗ ab. Solving the quadratic, E1 ±=1 2/bracketleftbigg Waa+Wbb±/radicalBig (Waa−Wbb)2+4|Wab|2/bracketrightbigg . (7.33) This is the fundamental result of degenerate perturbation theory; the two roots correspond to the two perturbed energies. Example 7.3 Returning to Example 7.2, show that diagonalizing the matrix Wgives the same “good” states we found by solving the problem exactly. Solution : We need to calculate the matrix elements of W.F i r s t , Waa=/integraldisplay/integraldisplay ψ0 a(x,y)H/primeψ0 a(x,y)dx dy =/epsilon1mω2/integraldisplay |ψ0(x)|2xd x/integraldisplay |ψ0(y)|2ydy=0 (the integrands are both odd functions).

These two integrals are equal, and recalling (Equation 2.70) x=/radicalbigg /planckover2pi1 2mω(a++a−) 6This assumes that the eigenvalues of Waredistinct so that the degeneracy lifts at ﬁrst order. If not, any choice of α andβsatisﬁes Equation 7.30; you stilldon’t know what the good states are. The ﬁrst-order energies are correctly given by Equation 7.33 when this happens, and in many cases that’s all you require. But if you need to know the “good” states—for example to calculate higher-order corrections—you will have to use second-order degenerate perturbation theory (see Problems 7.39,7.40,a n d 7.41) or employ the theorem of Section 7.2.2 .7.2 Degenerate Perturbation Theory 291 we have Wab=/epsilon1mω2/bracketleftBigg/integraldisplay ψ0(x)/radicalbigg /planckover2pi1 2mω(a++a−)ψ1(x)dx/bracketrightBigg2 =/epsilon1/planckover2pi1ω 2/bracketleftbigg/integraldisplay ψ0(x)ψ0(x)dx/bracketrightbigg2 =/epsilon1/planckover2pi1ω Therefore, the matrix Wis W=/epsilon1/planckover2pi1ω 2/parenleftbigg01 10/parenrightbigg . The (normalized) eigenvectors of this matrix are 1√ 2/parenleftbigg1 1/parenrightbigg and1√ 2/parenleftbigg−1 1/parenrightbigg . These eigenvectors tell us which linear combination of ψ0 aandψ0 bare the good states: ψ0 ±=1√ 2/parenleftBig ψ0 b±ψ0 a/parenrightBig , just as in Equation 7.23. The eigenvalues of the matrix W, E1=±/epsilon1/planckover2pi1ω 2, (7.34) give the ﬁrst-order corrections to the energy (compare 7.33). If it happens that Wab=0i nE q u a t i o n 7.30 then the two eigenvectors are /parenleftbigg1 0/parenrightbigg and/parenleftbigg0 1/parenrightbigg and the energies, E1 +=Waa=/angbracketleftBig ψ0 a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 a/angbracketrightBig ,E1 −=Wbb=/angbracketleftBig ψ0 b/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 b/angbracketrightBig , (7.35) are precisely what we would have obtained using nondegenerate perturbation theory (Equa- tion7.9). We have simply been lucky : The statesψ0 aandψ0 bwere already the “good” linear combinations. Obviously, it would be greatly to our advantage if we could somehow guess the “good” states right from the start—then we could go ahead and use nondegenerate perturbation theory. As it turns out, we can very often do this by exploiting the theorem in the following section. 7.2.2 “Good” States Theorem: LetAbe a hermitian operator that commutes with H0andH/prime.I fψ0 aand ψ0 b(the degenerate eigenfunctions of H0)are also eigenfunctions of A, with distinct eigenvalues, Aψ0 a=μψ0 a,Aψ0 b=νψ0 b,andμ/negationslash=ν, thenψ0 aandψ0 bare the “good” states to use in perturbation theory.292 CHAPTER 7 Time-Independent Perturbation Theory Proof: Since H(λ)=H0+λH/primeandAcommute, there exist simultaneous eigenstates ψγ(λ)where H(λ)ψγ(λ)=E(λ)ψγ(λ)andAψγ(λ)=γψγ(λ). (7.36) The fact that Ais hermitian means/angbracketleftBig ψ0 a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleAψγ(λ)/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig Aψ0 a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψγ(λ)/angbracketrightBig γ/angbracketleftBig ψ0 a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψγ(λ)/angbracketrightBig =μ∗/angbracketleftBig ψ0 a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψγ(λ)/angbracketrightBig (7.37) (γ−μ)/angbracketleftBig ψ0 a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψγ(λ)/angbracketrightBig =0, (7.38) (making use of the fact that μis real). This holds true for any value of λand taking the limit asλ→0w eh a v e/angbracketleftBig ψ0 a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψγ(0)/angbracketrightBig =0 unlessγ=μ, and similarly/angbracketleftBig ψ0 b/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψγ(0)/angbracketrightBig =0 unlessγ=ν. Now the good states are linear combinations of ψ0 aandψ0 b:ψγ(0)=αψ0 a+βψ0 b. From above it follows that either γ=μ, in which case β=/angbracketleftbig ψ0 b/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψγ(0)/angbracketrightbig =0 and the good state is simply ψ0 a,o rγ=νand the good state is ψ0 b.Q E D Once we identify the “good” states, either by solving Equation 7.30 or by applying this theorem, we can use these “good” states as our unperturbed states and apply ordinary non- degenerate perturbation theory.7In most cases, the operator Awill be suggested by symmetry; as you saw in Chapter 6, symmetries are associated with operators that commute with H— precisely what are required to identify the good states. Example 7.4 Find an operator Athat satisﬁes the requirements of the preceding theorem to construct the “good” states in Examples 7.2and7.3. Solution : The perturbation H/primehas less symmetry than H0.H0had continuous rotational symmetry, but H=H0+H/primeis only invariant under rotations by integer multiples of π.F o r A, take the operator R(π)that rotates a function counterclockwise by an angle π. Acting on our statsψaandψbwe have R(π)ψ0 a(x,y)=ψ0 a(−x,−y)=−ψ0 a(x,y), R(π)ψ0 b(x,y)=ψ0 b(−x,−y)=−ψ0 b(x,y). That’s no good; we need an operator with distinct eigenvalues. How about the operator that interchanges xandy? This is a reﬂection about a 45◦diagonal of the well. Call this operator D.Dcommutes with both H0andH/prime, since they are unchanged when you switch xandy.N o w , 7Note that the theorem is more general than Equation 7.30. In order to identify the good states from Equation 7.30, the energies E1±need to be different. In some cases they are the same and the energies of the degenerate states split at second, third, or higher order in perturbation theory. But the theorem allows you to identify the good states in every case.7.2 Degenerate Perturbation Theory 293 Dψ0 a(x,y)=ψ0 a(y,x)=ψ0 b(x,y), Dψ0 b(x,y)=ψ0 b(y,x)=ψ0 a(x,y). So our degenerate eigenstates are not eigenstates of D. But we can construct linear combinations that are: ψ0 ±≡±ψ0 a+ψ0 b. (7.39) Then D/parenleftBig ±ψ0 a+ψ0 b/parenrightBig =± Dψ0 a+Dψ0 b=±ψ0 b+ψ0 a=±/parenleftBig ±ψ0 a+ψ0 b/parenrightBig . These are “good” states, since they are eigenstates of an operator Dwith distinct eigenvalues(±1), and Dcommutes with both H0andH/prime. Moral: If you’re faced with degenerate states, look around for some hermitian operator A that commutes with H0andH/prime; pick as your unperturbed states ones that are simultaneously eigenfunctions of H0andA(with distinct eigenvalues). Then use ordinary ﬁrst-order pertur- bation theory. If you can’t ﬁnd such an operator, you’ll have to resort to Equation 7.33,b u ti n practice this is seldom necessary. Problem 7.8 Let the two “good” unperturbed states be ψ0 ±=α±ψ0 a+β±ψ0 b, whereα±andβ±are determined (up to normalization) by Equation 7.27 (or Equation 7.29). Show explicitly that (a)ψ0 ±are orthogonal/parenleftbig /angbracketleftψ0 +|ψ0 −/angbracketright=0/parenrightbig ; (b)/angbracketleftbig ψ0 +/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 −/angbracketrightbig =0; (c)/angbracketleftbig ψ0 ±/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 ±/angbracketrightbig =E1 ±, with E1 ±given by Equation 7.33. Problem 7.9 Consider a particle of mass mthat is free to move in a one-dimensional region of length Lthat closes on itself (for instance, a bead that slides frictionlessly on a circular wire of circumference L, as in Problem 2.46). (a)Show that the stationary states can be written in the form ψn(x)=1√ Le2πinx/L,(−L/2<x<L/2), where n=0,±1,±2,..., and the allowed energies are En=2 m/parenleftbiggnπ/planckover2pi1 L/parenrightbigg2 . Notice that—with the exception of the ground state (n=0)—these are all doubly degenerate. (b)Now suppose we introduce the perturbation H/prime=−V0e−x2/a2,294 CHAPTER 7 Time-Independent Perturbation Theory where a/lessmuchL. (This puts a little “dimple” in the potential at x=0, as though we bent the wire slightly to make a “trap”.) Find the ﬁrst-order correction to En,u s i n g Equation 7.33.Hint: To evaluate the integrals, exploit the fact that a/lessmuchLto extend the limits from ±L/2t o±∞; after all, H/primeis essentially zero outside −a<x<a. (c)What are the “good” linear combinations of ψnandψ−n, for this problem? ( Hint: use Eq. 7.27.) Show that with these states you get the ﬁrst-order correction using Equation 7.9. (d)Find a hermitian operator Athat ﬁts the requirements of the theorem, and show that the simultaneous eigenstates of H0andAare precisely the ones you used in (c). 7.2.3 Higher-Order Degeneracy In the previous section I assumed the degeneracy was two-fold, but it is easy to see how the method generalizes. In the case of n-fold degeneracy, we look for the eigenvalues of the n×n matrix Wij=/angbracketleftBig ψ0 i/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 j/angbracketrightBig . (7.40) For three-fold degeneracy (with degenerate states ψ0 a,ψ0 b, andψ0 c)the ﬁrst-order corrections to the energies E1are the eigenvalues of W, determined by solving ⎛ ⎝Waa Wab Wac Wba Wbb Wbc Wca Wcb Wcc⎞ ⎠⎛ ⎝α β γ⎞ ⎠=E1⎛ ⎝α β γ⎞ ⎠, (7.41) and the “good” states are the corresponding eigenvectors:8 ψ0=αψ0 a+βψ0 b+γψ0 c. (7.42) Once again, if you can think of an operator Athatcommutes with H0andH/prime, and use the simultaneous eigenfunctions of AandH0, then the Wmatrix will automatically be diagonal, and you won’t have to fuss with calculating the off-diagonal elements of Wor solving the characteristic equation.9(If you’re nervous about my generalization from two-fold degeneracy ton-fold degeneracy, work Problem 7.13.) Problem 7.10 Show that the ﬁrst-order energy corrections computed in Example 7.3(Equa- tion 7.34) agree with an expansion of the exact solution (Equation 7.21) to ﬁrst order in/epsilon1. Problem 7.11 Suppose we perturb the inﬁnite cubical well (Problem 4.2) by putting a delta function “bump” at the point (a/4,a/2,3a/4): H/prime=a3V0δ(x−a/4)δ(y−a/2)δ(z−3a/4). Find the ﬁrst-order corrections to the energy of the ground state and the (triply degenerate) ﬁrst excited states. 8Ifthe eigenvalues are degenerate, see footnote 6. 9Degenerate perturbation theory amounts to diagonalization of the degenerate part of the Hamiltonian; see Problems 7.34 and7.35.7.3 The Fine Structure of Hydrogen 295 ∗ Problem 7.12 Consider a quantum system with just three linearly independent states. Suppose the Hamiltonian, in matrix form, is H=V0⎛ ⎝(1−/epsilon1)00 01/epsilon1 0/epsilon12⎞ ⎠, where V0is a constant, and /epsilon1is some small number (/epsilon1/lessmuch1). (a)Write down the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the unperturbed Hamiltonian (/epsilon1=0). (b)Solve for the exact eigenvalues of H. Expand each of them as a power series in /epsilon1, up to second order. (c)Use ﬁrst- and second-order non-degenerate perturbation theory to ﬁnd the approxi- mate eigenvalue for the state that grows out of the nondegenerate eigenvector of H0. Compare the exact result, from (b). (d)Use degenerate perturbation theory to ﬁnd the ﬁrst-order correction to the two initially degenerate eigenvalues. Compare the exact results. Problem 7.13 In the text I asserted that the ﬁrst-order corrections to an n-fold degenerate energy are the eigenvalues of the Wmatrix, and I justiﬁed this claim as the “natural” generalization of the case n=2.Prove it, by reproducing the steps in Section 7.2.1 , starting with ψ0=n/summationdisplay j=1αjψ0 j (generalizing Equation 7.17), and ending by showing that the analog to Equation 7.27 can be interpreted as the eigenvalue equation for the matrix W. 7.3 THE FINE STRUCTURE OF HYDROGEN In our study of the hydrogen atom (Section 4.2) we took the Hamiltonian—called the Bohr Hamiltonian—to be HBohr=−/planckover2pi12 2m∇2−e2 4π/epsilon101 r(7.43) (electron kinetic energy plus Coulombic potential energy). But this is not quite the whole story. We have already learned how to correct for the motion of the nucleus: Just replace mby the reduced mass (Problem 5.1). More signiﬁcant is the so-called ﬁne structure , which is actually due to two distinct mechanisms: a relativistic correction , and spin-orbit coupling . Compared to the Bohr energies (Equation 4.70), ﬁne structure is a tiny perturbation—smaller by a factor ofα2, where α≡e2 4π/epsilon10/planckover2pi1c≈1 137.036(7.44) is the famous ﬁne structure constant . Smaller still (by another factor of α)is the Lamb shift, associated with the quantization of the electric ﬁeld, and smaller by yet another order of magnitude is the hyperﬁne structure , which is due to the interaction between the magnetic296 CHAPTER 7 Time-Independent Perturbation Theory Table 7.1: Hierarchy of corrections to the Bohr energies of hydrogen.

This hierarchy is summarized in Table 7.1. In the present section we will analyze the ﬁne structure of hydrogen, as an application of time-independent perturbation theory. Problem 7.14 (a)Express the Bohr energies in terms of the ﬁne structure constant and the rest energy/parenleftbig mc2/parenrightbig of the electron. (b)Calculate the ﬁne structure constant from ﬁrst principles (i.e., without recourse to the empirical values of /epsilon10,e,/planckover2pi1, and c).Comment: The ﬁne structure constant is undoubtedly the most fundamental pure (dimensionless) number in all of physics. It relates the basic constants of electromagnetism (the charge of the electron), rel- ativity (the speed of light), and quantum mechanics (Planck’s constant). If you can solve part (b), you have the most certain Nobel Prize in history waiting for you. But I wouldn’t recommend spending a lot of time on it right now; many smart people have tried, and all (so far) have failed. 7.3.1 The Relativistic Correction The ﬁrst term in the Hamiltonian is supposed to represent kinetic energy: T=1 2mv2=p2 2m, (7.45) and the canonical substitution p→− i/planckover2pi1∇yields the operator T=−/planckover2pi12 2m∇2. (7.46) But Equation 7.45 is the classical expression for kinetic energy; the relativistic formula is T=mc2 /radicalBig 1−(v/c)2−mc2. (7.47) The ﬁrst term is the total relativistic energy (not counting potential energy, which we aren’t concerned with at the moment), and the second term is the restenergy—the difference is the energy attributable to motion. We need to express Tin terms of the (relativistic) momentum, p=mv/radicalBig 1−(v/c)2, (7.48)7.3 The Fine Structure of Hydrogen 297 instead of velocity. Notice that p2c2+m2c4=m2v2c2+m2c4/bracketleftbig 1−(v/c)2/bracketrightbig 1−(v/c)2=m2c4 1−(v/c)2=/parenleftBig T+mc2/parenrightBig2 , so T=/radicalBig p2c2+m2c4−mc2. (7.49) This relativistic equation for kinetic energy reduces (of course) to the classical result (Equation 7.45), in the nonrelativistic limit p/lessmuchmc; expanding in powers of the small number (p/mc), we have T=mc2/bracketleftBigg/radicalbigg 1+/parenleftBigp mc/parenrightBig2 −1/bracketrightBigg =mc2/bracketleftbigg 1+1 2/parenleftBigp mc/parenrightBig2 −1 8/parenleftBigp mc/parenrightBig4 ···− 1/bracketrightbigg =p2 2m−p4 8m3c2+···. (7.50) The lowest-order10relativistic correction to the Hamiltonian is therefore H/prime r=−p4 8m3c2. (7.51) In ﬁrst-order perturbation theory, the correction to Enis given by the expectation value of H/primein the unperturbed state (Equation 7.9): E1 r=/angbracketleftbig H/prime r/angbracketrightbig =−1 8m3c2/angbracketleftBig ψ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglep4ψ/angbracketrightBig =−1 8m3c2/angbracketleftBig p2ψ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglep2ψ/angbracketrightBig . (7.52) Now, the Schrödinger equation (for the unperturbed states) says p2ψ=2m(E−V)ψ, (7.53) and hence11 E1 r=−1 2mc2/angbracketleftBig (E−V)2/angbracketrightBig =−1 2mc2/bracketleftBig E2−2E/angbracketleftV/angbracketright+/angbracketleftBig V2/angbracketrightBig/bracketrightBig . (7.54) So far this is entirely general; but we’re interested in hydrogen, for which V(r)= −(1/4π/epsilon10)e2/r: E1 r=−1 2mc2/bracketleftBigg E2 n+2En/parenleftbigge2 4π/epsilon10/parenrightbigg/angbracketleftbigg1 r/angbracketrightbigg +/parenleftbigge2 4π/epsilon10/parenrightbigg2/angbracketleftbigg1 r2/angbracketrightbigg/bracketrightBigg , (7.55) where Enis the Bohr energy of the state in question. To complete the job, we need the expectation values of 1 /rand 1/r2, in the (unperturbed) stateψn/lscriptm(Equation 4.89). The ﬁrst is easy (see Problem 7.15): /angbracketleftbigg1 r/angbracketrightbigg =1 n2a, (7.56) 10The kinetic energy of the electron in hydrogen is on the order of 10 eV , which is minuscule compared to its rest energy (511,000 eV), so the hydrogen atom is basically nonrelativistic, and we can afford to keep only the lowest- order correction. In Equation 7.50,pis the relativistic momentum (Equation 7.48),notthe classical momentum mv. It is the former that we now associate with the quantum operator −i/planckover2pi1∇, in Equation 7.51. 11An earlier edition of this book claimed that p4is not hermitian for states with /lscript=0 (calling into question the maneuver leading to Equation 7.54). That was incorrect— p4ishermitian, for all /lscript(see Problem 7.18).298 CHAPTER 7 Time-Independent Perturbation Theory where ais the Bohr radius (Equation 4.72). The second is not so simple to derive (see Problem 7.42), but the answer is12 /angbracketleftbigg1 r2/angbracketrightbigg =1 (/lscript+1/2)n3a2. (7.57) It follows that E1 r=−1 2mc2/bracketleftBigg E2 n+2En/parenleftbigge2 4π/epsilon10/parenrightbigg1 n2a+/parenleftbigge2 4π/epsilon10/parenrightbigg21 (/lscript+1/2)n3a2/bracketrightBigg , or, eliminating a(using Equation 4.72) and expressing everything in terms of En(using Equation 4.70): E1 r=−(En)2 2mc2/bracketleftbigg4n /lscript+1/2−3/bracketrightbigg . (7.58) Evidently the relativistic correction is smaller than En, by a factor of about En/mc2=2× 10−5. You might have noticed that I used non-degenerate perturbation theory in this calcu- lation (Equation 7.52), in spite of the fact that the hydrogen atom is highly degenerate. But the perturbation is spherically symmetric, so it commutes with L2and Lz. More- over, the eigenfunctions of these operators (taken together) have distinct eigenvalues for the n2states with a given En. Luckily, then, the wave functions ψn/lscriptmarethe “good” states for this problem (or, as we say, n,/lscript, and mare the good quantum numbers ), so as it happens the use of nondegenerate perturbation theory was legitimate (see the “Moral” to Section 7.2.1 ). From Equation 7.58 we see that some of the degeneracy of the nth energy level has lifted. The(2/lscript+1)-fold degeneracy in mremains; as we saw in Example 6.3it is due to rotational symmetry, a symmetry that remains intact with this perturbation. On the other hand, the “acci- dental” degeneracy in /lscripthas disappeared; since its source is an additional symmetry unique to the 1/rpotential (see Problem 6.34), we expect that degeneracy to be broken by practically anyperturbation. ∗ Problem 7.15 Use the virial theorem (Problem 4.48) to prove Equation 7.56.

This orbiting positive charge sets up a magnetic ﬁeld B,i nt h e electron frame, which exerts a torque on the spinning electron, tending to align its magnetic moment(μ)along the direction of the ﬁeld. The Hamiltonian (Equation 4.157 )i s H=−μ·B. (7.59) To begin with, we need to ﬁgure out the magnetic ﬁeld of the proton ( B) and the dipole moment of the electron(μ). −e r +eB, L Figure 7.6: Hydrogen atom, from the electron’s perspective. 13Thanks to Edward Ross and Li Yi-ding for ﬁxing this problem.300 CHAPTER 7 Time-Independent Perturbation Theory rµ, S q, m Figure 7.7: A ring of charge, rotating about its axis. The Magnetic Field of the Proton. If we picture the proton (from the electron’s perspec- tive) as a continuous current loop (Figure 7.6), its magnetic ﬁeld can be calculated from the Biot–Savart law: B=μ0I 2r, with an effective current I=e/T, where eis the charge of the proton and Tis the period of the orbit. On the other hand, the orbital angular momentum of the electron (in the rest frame of the nucleus )i sL=rmv=2πmr2/T. Moreover, BandLpoint in the same direction (up, in Figure 7.6), so B=1 4π/epsilon10e mc2r3L. (7.60) (I used c=1/√/epsilon10μ0to eliminateμ0in favor of/epsilon10.) The Magnetic Dipole Moment of the Electron. The magnetic dipole moment of a spinning charge is related to its (spin) angular momentum; the proportionality factor is the gyromagnetic ratio (which we already encountered in Section 4.4.2 ). Let’s derive it, this time, using classical electrodynamics. Consider ﬁrst a charge qsmeared out around a ring of radius r, which rotates about the axis with period T(Figure 7.7). The magnetic dipole moment of the ring is deﬁned as the current(q/T)times the area/parenleftbig πr2/parenrightbig : μ=qπr2 T. If the mass of the ring is m, its angular momentum is the moment of inertia/parenleftbig mr2/parenrightbig times the angular velocity (2π/T): S=2πmr2 T. The gyromagnetic ratio for this conﬁguration is evidently μ/S=q/2m. Notice that it is independent of r(and T). If I had some more complicated object, such as a sphere (all I require is that it be a ﬁgure of revolution, rotating about its axis), I could calculate μandS by chopping it into little rings, and adding up their contributions. As long as the mass and the charge are distributed in the same manner (so that the charge-to-mass ratio is uniform), the gyromagnetic ratio will be the same for each ring, and hence also for the object as a whole. Moreover, the directions of μandSare the same (or opposite, if the charge is negative), so7.3 The Fine Structure of Hydrogen 301 j=7/2 j=5/2 j=3/2 j=1/2n=4 j=5/2 j=3/2 j=1/2n=3 j=3/2 j=1/2n=2 j=1/2n=1 l=0 (S)l=1 (P)l=2 (D)l=3 (F) Figure 7.8: Energy levels of hydrogen, including ﬁne structure (not to scale). μ=/parenleftBigq 2m/parenrightBig S. (7.61) That was a purely classical calculation, however; as it turns out the electron’s magnetic moment is twice the classical value: μe=−e mS. (7.62) The “extra” factor of 2 was explained by Dirac, in his relativistic theory of the electron.14 Putting all this together, we have H=/parenleftbigge2 4π/epsilon10/parenrightbigg1 m2c2r3S·L. But there is a serious fraud in this calculation: I did the analysis in the rest frame of the electron, but that’s not an inertial system —itaccelerates , as the electron orbits around the nucleus. You 14We have already noted that it can be dangerous to picture the electron as a spinning sphere (see Problem 4.28), and it is not too surprising that the naive classical model gets the gyromagnetic ratio wrong. The deviation from the classical expectation is known as the g-factor :μ=g(q/2m)S. Thus the g-factor of the electron, in Dirac’s theory, is exactly 2. But quantum electrodynamics reveals tiny corrections to this: geis actually 2+(α/π)+ ···= 2.002.... The calculation and measurement (which agree to exquisite precision) of the so-called anomalous magnetic moment of the electron were among the greatest achievements of twentieth-century physics.302 CHAPTER 7 Time-Independent Perturbation Theory can get away with this if you make an appropriate kinematic correction, known as the Thomas precession .15In this context it throws in a factor of 1/2:16 H/prime so=/parenleftbigge2 8π/epsilon10/parenrightbigg1 m2c2r3S·L. (7.63) This is the spin-orbit interaction ; apart from two corrections (the modiﬁed gyromagnetic ratio for the electron and the Thomas precession factor—which, coincidentally, exactly cancel one another) it is just what you would expect on the basis of a naive classical model. Physically, it is due to the torque exerted on the magnetic dipole moment of the spinning electron, by the magnetic ﬁeld of the proton, in the electron’s instantaneous rest frame. Now the quantum mechanics. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the Hamiltonian no longer commutes with LandS, so the spin and orbital angular momenta are not separately conserved (see Problem 7.19). However, H/prime sodoes commute with L2,S2and the total angular momentum J≡L+S, (7.64) and hence these quantities areconserved (Equation 3.73). To put it another way, the eigenstates ofLzandSzare not “good” states to use in perturbation theory, but the eigenstates of L2,S2, J2, and Jzare.N o w J2=(L+S)·(L+S)=L2+S2+2L·S, so L·S=1 2/parenleftBig J2−L2−S2/parenrightBig , (7.65) and therefore the eigenvalues of L·Sare /planckover2pi12 2/bracketleftbig j(j+1)−/lscript(/lscript+1)−s(s+1)/bracketrightbig . In this case, of course, s=1/2. Meanwhile, the expectation value of 1 /r3(see Problem 7.43)17 is /angbracketleftbigg1 r3/angbracketrightbigg =1 /lscript(/lscript+1/2)(/lscript+1)n3a3, (7.66) 15One way of thinking of it is that the electron is continually stepping from one inertial system to another; Thomas precession amounts to the cumulative effect of all these Lorentz transformations. We could avoid the whole prob- lem, of course, by staying in the labframe, in which the nucleus is at rest. In that case the ﬁeld of the proton is purely electric , and you might wonder why it exerts any torque on the electron. Well, the fact is that a moving magnetic dipole acquires an electric dipole moment, and in the lab frame the spin-orbit coupling is due to the interaction of the electric ﬁeld of the nucleus with the electric dipole moment of the electron. Because this analysis requires more sophisticated electrodynamics, it seems best to adopt the electron’s perspective, where the physical mechanism is more transparent. 16More precisely, Thomas precession subtracts 1 from the gyromagnetic ratio (see R. R. Haar and L. J. Curtis, A m .J .P h y s . ,55, 1044 (1987)). 17In Problem 7.43 the expectation values are calculated using the hydrogen wave functions ψ(n/lscriptm)—that is, eigen- states of Lz—whereas we now want eigenstates of Jz—which are linear combinations of m=mj+1 2and m=mj−1 But since/angbracketleftbig rs/angbracketrightbig is independent of m, it doesn’t matter.7.3 The Fine Structure of Hydrogen 303 and we conclude that E1 so=/angbracketleftbig H/prime so/angbracketrightbig =e2 8π/epsilon101 m2c2/parenleftbig /planckover2pi12/2/parenrightbig/bracketleftbig j(j+1)−/lscript(/lscript+1)−3/4/bracketrightbig /lscript(/lscript+1/2)(/lscript+1)n3a3, or, expressing it all in terms of En:18 E1 so=(En)2 mc2/braceleftBigg n/bracketleftbig j(j+1)−/lscript(/lscript+1)−3/4/bracketrightbig /lscript(/lscript+1/2)(/lscript+1)/bracerightBigg .

The z-component eigenvalues for orbital and spin angular momentum (mland ms)are no longer “good” quantum numbers—the stationary states are linear combinations of states with different values of these quantities; the “good” quantum numbers are n,/lscript,s,j, and mj.19 Problem 7.19 Evaluate the following commutators: (a) [L·S,L],( b ) [L·S,S],( c ) [L·S,J],( d )/bracketleftbig L·S,L2/bracketrightbig ,( e )/bracketleftbig L·S,S2/bracketrightbig ,( f )/bracketleftbig L·S,J2/bracketrightbig .Hint: LandSsatisfy the fun- damental commutation relations for angular momentum (Equations 4.99 and4.134 ), but they commute with each other. 18The case/lscript=0 looks problematic, since we are ostensibly dividing by zero. On the other hand, the numerator isalso zero, since in this case j=s; so Equation 7.67 is indeterminate. On physical grounds there shouldn’t be any spin-orbit coupling when /lscript=0. In any event, the problem disappears when the spin-orbit coupling is added to the relativistic correction, and their sum(Equation 7.68) is correct for all/lscript. If you’re feeling uneasy about this whole calculation, I don’t blame you; take comfort in the fact that the exact solution can be obtained by using the (relativistic) Dirac equation in place of the (nonrelativistic) Schrödinger equation, and it conﬁrms the results we obtain here by less rigorous means (see Problem 7.22.) 19To write|jmj/angbracketright(for given/lscriptands)as a linear combination of |/lscriptsm/lscriptms/angbracketrightwe would use the appropriate Clebsch– Gordan coefﬁcients (Equation 4.183 ).304 CHAPTER 7 Time-Independent Perturbation Theory ∗ Problem 7.20 Derive the ﬁne structure formula (Equation 7.68) from the relativistic cor- rection (Equation 7.58) and the spin-orbit coupling (Equation 7.67).Hint: Note that j=/lscript±1/2 (except for/lscript=0, where only the plus sign occurs); treat the plus sign and the minus sign separately, and you’ll ﬁnd that you get the same ﬁnal answer either way. ∗∗ Problem 7.21 The most prominent feature of the hydrogen spectrum in the visible region is the red Balmer line, coming from the transition n=3t on=2. First of all, determine the wavelength and frequency of this line according to the Bohr theory. Fine structure splits this line into several closely-spaced lines; the question is: How many , and what is their spacing ?Hint: First determine how many sublevels the n=2 level splits into, and ﬁnd E1 fsfor each of these, in eV . Then do the same for n=3. Draw an energy level diagram showing all possible transitions from n=3t on=2. The energy released (in the form of a photon) is(E3−E2)+/Delta1E, the ﬁrst part being common to all of them, and /Delta1E(due to ﬁne structure) varying from one transition to the next. Find /Delta1E(in eV) for each tran- sition. Finally, convert to photon frequency, and determine the spacing between adjacent spectral lines (in Hz)— notthe frequency interval between each line and the unperturbed line (which is, of course, unobservable), but the frequency interval between each line and thenextone.

This phenomenon is known as the Zeeman effect . For a single electron, the perturbation is21 H/prime Z=−/parenleftbig μl+μs/parenrightbig ·Bext, (7.70) 20Bethe and Salpeter (footnote 12,p a g e 298), page 238. 21This is correct to ﬁrst order in B. We are ignoring a term of order B2in the Hamiltonian (the exact result was calcu- lated in Problem 4.72). In addition, the orbital magnetic moment (Equation 7.72) is proportional to the mechanical angular momentum, not the canonical angular momentum (see Problem 7.49). These neglected terms give correc- tions of order B2, comparable to the second-order corrections from H/prime Z. Since we’re working to ﬁrst order, they are safe to ignore in this context.7.4 The Zeeman Effect 305 where μs=−e mS (7.71) (Equation 7.62) is the magnetic dipole moment associated with electron spin, and μl=−e 2mL (7.72) (Equation 7.61) is the dipole moment associated with orbital motion.22Thus H/prime Z=e 2m(L+2S)·Bext. (7.73) The nature of the Zeeman splitting depends critically on the strength of the external ﬁeld in comparison with the internal ﬁeld (Equation 7.60) that gives rise to spin-orbit coupling. If Bext/lessmuchBint, then ﬁne structure dominates, and H/prime Zcan be treated as a small perturbation, whereas if Bext/greatermuchBint, then the Zeeman effect dominates, and ﬁne structure becomes the perturbation. In the intermediate zone, where the two ﬁelds are comparable, we need the full machinery of degenerate perturbation theory, and it is necessary to diagonalize the relevant portion of the Hamiltonian “by hand.” In the following sections we shall explore each of these regimes brieﬂy, for the case of hydrogen. Problem 7.23 Use Equation 7.60 to estimate the internal ﬁeld in hydrogen, and characterize quantitatively a “strong” and “weak” Zeeman ﬁeld. 7.4.1 Weak-Field Zeeman Effect IfBext/lessmuchBint, ﬁne structure dominates; we treat HBohr+H/prime fsas the “unperturbed” Hamilto- nian and H/prime Zas the perturbation. Our “unperturbed” eigenstates are then those appropriate to ﬁne structure:|n/lscriptjmj/angbracketrightand the “unperturbed” energies are Enj(Equation 7.69). Even though ﬁne structure has lifted some of the degeneracy in the Bohr model, these states are still degen- erate, since the energy does not depend on mjor/lscript. Luckily the states |n/lscriptjmj/angbracketrightare the “good” states for treating the perturbation H/prime Z(meaning we don’t have to write down the Wmatrix for H/prime Z—it’s already diagonal) since H/prime Zcommutes with Jz(so long as we align Bextwith the z axis) and L2, and each of the degenerate states is uniquely labeled by the two quantum numbers mjand/lscript.

(7.78) The term in square brackets is known as the Landé g-factor ,gJ.24 The energy corrections are then E1 Z=μBgJBextmj, (7.79) where μB≡e/planckover2pi1 2m=5.788×10−5eV/T (7.80) is the so-called Bohr magneton . Recall (Example 6.3) that degeneracy in the quantum number mis a consequence of rotational invariance.25The perturbation H/prime Zpicks out a speciﬁc direc- tion in space (the direction of B)which breaks the rotational symmetry and lifts the degeneracy inm. 23While Equation 7.78 was derived by replacing Sby its average value, the result is not an approximation; L+2S andJare both vector operators and the states are angular-momentum eigenstates. Therefore, the matrix elements can be evaluated by use of the Wigner–Eckart theorem (Equations 6.59–6.61). It follows (Problem 7.25) that the matrix elements are proportional: /angbracketleftBig n/lscriptjmj/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleL+2S/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptjm/prime j/angbracketrightBig =gJ/angbracketleftBig n/lscriptjmj/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleJ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptjm/prime j/angbracketrightBig (7.77) and the constant of proportionality gJis the ratio of reduced matrix elements. All that remains is to evaluate gJ: see Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, Bernard Diu, and Franck Laloë, Quantum Mechanics , Wiley, New York (1977), V ol. 2, Chapter X. 24In the case of a single electron, where j=/lscript±1 2,gJ=(2j+1)/(2/lscript+1). 25That example speciﬁcally treated orbital angular momentum, but the same argument holds for the total angular momentum.7.4 The Zeeman Effect 307 E μBBext mj=1/2 mj=−1/2−13.6 (1 + α2/4) eV Figure 7.10: Weak-ﬁeld Zeeman splitting of the ground state of hydrogen; the upper line/parenleftbig mj=1/2/parenrightbig has slope 1, the lower line/parenleftbig mj=−1/2/parenrightbig has slope−1. Thetotal energy is the sum of the ﬁne-structure part (Equation 7.69) and the Zeeman con- tribution (Equation 7.79). For example, the ground state (n=1,/lscript=0,j=1/2, and therefore gJ=2)splits into two levels: −13.6e V/parenleftBig 1+α2/4/parenrightBig ±μBBext, (7.81) with the plus sign for mj=1/2, and minus for mj=− 1/2. These energies are plotted (as functions of Bext)in Figure 7.10. ∗ Problem 7.24 Consider the (eight) n=2 states,|2/lscriptjm j/angbracketright. Find the energy of each state, under weak-ﬁeld Zeeman splitting, and construct a diagram like Figure 7.10 to show how the energies evolve as Bextincreases. Label each line clearly, and indicate its slope. Problem 7.25 Use the Wigner–Eckart theorem (Equations 6.59–6.61) to prove that the matrix elements of any two vector operators, Vand W, are proportional in a basis of angular-momentum eigenstates: /angbracketleftbig n/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingleV/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightbig =α/angbracketleftbig n/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingleW/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightbig . (7.82) Comment : With/lscriptreplaced by j(the theorem holds regardless of whether the states are eigenstates of orbital, spin, or total angular momentum), V=L+2SandW=J,t h i s proves Equation 7.77. 7.4.2 Strong-Field Zeeman Effect IfBext/greatermuchBint, the Zeeman effect dominates26and we take the “unperturbed” Hamiltonian to beHBohr+H/prime Zand the perturbation to be H/prime fs. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is 26In this regime the Zeeman effect is also known as the Paschen–Back effect .308 CHAPTER 7 Time-Independent Perturbation Theory H/prime Z=e 2mBext(Lz+2Sz), and it is straightforward to compute the “unperturbed” energies: Enmlms=−13.6e V n2+μBBext(m/lscript+2ms). (7.83) The states we are using here: |n/lscriptm/lscriptms/angbracketrightare degenerate, since the energy does not depend on /lscript, and there is an additional degeneracy due to the fact that, for example, m/lscript=3 and ms=−1/2 orm/lscript=1 and ms=1/2 have the same energy. Again we are lucky; |n/lscriptm/lscriptms/angbracketrightare the “good” states for treating the perturbation. The ﬁne structure Hamiltonian H/prime fscommutes with both L2 and with Jz(these two operators serve as Ain the theorem of Section 7.2.2 ); the ﬁrst operator resolves the degeneracy in /lscriptand the second resolves the degeneracy from coincidences in m/lscript+2ms=mj+ms. In ﬁrst-order perturbation theory the ﬁne structure correction to these levels is E1 fs=/angbracketleftbig n/lscriptm/lscriptms/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/parenleftbig H/prime r+H/prime so/parenrightbig/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/lscriptms/angbracketrightbig . (7.84) The relativistic contribution is the same as before (Equation 7.58); for the spin-orbit term (Equation 7.63) we need /angbracketleftS·L/angbracketright=/angbracketleftSx/angbracketright/angbracketleftLx/angbracketright+/angbracketleftbig Sy/angbracketrightbig/angbracketleftbig Ly/angbracketrightbig +/angbracketleftSz/angbracketright/angbracketleftLz/angbracketright=/planckover2pi12mlms (7.85) (note that/angbracketleftSx/angbracketright=/angbracketleftbig Sy/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftLx/angbracketright=/angbracketleftLx/angbracketright=0 for eigenstates of SzandLz). Putting all this together (Problem 7.26), we conclude that E1 fs=13.6e V n3α2/braceleftbigg3 4n−/bracketleftbigg/lscript(/lscript+1)−m/lscriptms /lscript(/lscript+1/2)(/lscript+1)/bracketrightbigg/bracerightbigg . (7.86) (The term in square brackets is indeterminate for /lscript=0; its correct value in this case is 1—see Problem 7.28.) The total energy is the sum of the Zeeman part (Equation 7.83) and the ﬁne structure contribution (Equation 7.86). Problem 7.26 Starting with Equation 7.84, and using Equations 7.58,7.63,7.66, and 7.85, derive Equation 7.86. ∗∗ Problem 7.27 Consider the (eight) n=2 states,|2/lscriptm/lscriptms/angbracketright. Find the energy of each state, under strong-ﬁeld Zeeman splitting. Express each answer as the sum of three terms: the Bohr energy, the ﬁne-structure (proportional to α2), and the Zeeman contribution (pro- portional toμBBext). If you ignore ﬁne structure altogether, how many distinct levels are there, and what are their degeneracies? Problem 7.28 If/lscript=0, then j=s,mj=ms, and the “good” states are the same (|nm s/angbracketright) for weak andstrong ﬁelds. Determine E1 Z(from Equation 7.74) and the ﬁne structure energies (Equation 7.69), and write down the general result for the /lscript=0 Zeeman effect— regardless of the strength of the ﬁeld. Show that the strong-ﬁeld formula (Equation 7.86) reproduces this result, provided that we interpret the indeterminate term in square brackets as 1.7.4 The Zeeman Effect 309 7.4.3 Intermediate-Field Zeeman Effect In the intermediate regime neither H/prime ZnorH/prime fsdominates, and we must treat the two on an equal footing, as perturbations to the Bohr Hamiltonian (Equation 7.43): H/prime=H/prime Z+H/prime fs. (7.87) I’ll conﬁne my attention here to the case n=2 (you get to do n=3 in Problem 7.30). It’s not obvious what the “good” states are, so we’ll have to resort to the full machinery of degenerate perturbation theory. I’ll choose basis states characterized by /lscript,j, and mj.27Using the Clebsch– Gordan coefﬁcients (Problem 4.60 or Table 4.8) to express |jm j/angbracketrightas linear combinations of |/lscriptsmlms/angbracketright,28we have: /lscript=0: ψ1≡/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1 21 2/angbracketrightbig =/vextendsingle/vextendsingle01 201 2/angbracketrightbig , ψ2≡/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1 2−1 2/angbracketrightbig =/vextendsingle/vextendsingle01 20−1 2/angbracketrightbig , /lscript=1: ψ3≡/vextendsingle/vextendsingle3 23 2/angbracketrightbig =/vextendsingle/vextendsingle11 211 2/angbracketrightbig , ψ4≡/vextendsingle/vextendsingle3 2−3 2/angbracketrightbig =/vextendsingle/vextendsingle11 2−1−1 2/angbracketrightbig , ψ5≡/vextendsingle/vextendsingle3 21 2/angbracketrightbig =√2/3/vextendsingle/vextendsingle11 201 2/angbracketrightbig +√1/3/vextendsingle/vextendsingle11 21−1 2/angbracketrightbig , ψ6≡/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1 21 2/angbracketrightbig =−√1/3/vextendsingle/vextendsingle11 201 2/angbracketrightbig +√2/3/vextendsingle/vextendsingle11 21−1 2/angbracketrightbig , ψ7≡/vextendsingle/vextendsingle3 2−1 2/angbracketrightbig =√1/3/vextendsingle/vextendsingle11 2−11 2/angbracketrightbig +√2/3/vextendsingle/vextendsingle11 20−1 2/angbracketrightbig , ψ8≡/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1 2−1 2/angbracketrightbig =−√2/3/vextendsingle/vextendsingle11 2−11 2/angbracketrightbig +√1/3/vextendsingle/vextendsingle11 20−1 2/angbracketrightbig .

(7.88) The eigenvalues of the second block are the same, but with the sign of βreversed. The eight energies are listed in Table 7.2, and plotted against Bextin Figure 7.11. In the zero-ﬁeld limit (β=0)they reduce to the ﬁne structure values; for weak ﬁelds (β/lessmuchγ)they reproduce what you got in Problem 7.24; for strong ﬁelds (β/greatermuchγ)we recover the results of Problem 7.27 (note the convergence to ﬁve distinct energy levels, at very high ﬁelds, as predicted in Problem 7.27).

(7.89) (The proton is a composite structure, made up of three quarks, and its gyromagnetic ratio is not as simple as the electron’s—hence the explicit g-factor(gp), whose measured value is 5.59 as opposed to 2.00 for the electron.)

(7.90) So the Hamiltonian of the electron, in the magnetic ﬁeld due to the proton’s magnetic dipole moment, is (Equation 7.59) H/prime hf=μ0gpe2 8πmpme/bracketleftbig 3/parenleftbig Sp·ˆr/parenrightbig/parenleftbig Se·ˆr/parenrightbig −Sp·Se/bracketrightbig r3+μ0gpe2 3mpmeSp·Seδ3(r). (7.91) 29If you are unfamiliar with the delta function term in Equation 7.90, you can derive it by treating the dipole as a spinning charged spherical shell, in the limit as the radius goes to zero and the charge goes to inﬁnity (with μheld constant). See D. J. Grifﬁths, A m .J .P h y s . ,50, 698 (1982).312 CHAPTER 7 Time-Independent Perturbation Theory According to perturbation theory, the ﬁrst-order correction to the energy (Equation 7.9)i s the expectation value of the perturbing Hamiltonian: E1 hf=μ0gpe2 8πmpme/angbracketleftBigg 3/parenleftbig Sp·ˆr/parenrightbig/parenleftbig Se·ˆr/parenrightbig −Sp·Se r3/angbracketrightBigg +μ0gpe2 3mpme/angbracketleftbig Sp·Se/angbracketrightbig|ψ(0)|2. (7.92) In the ground state (or any other state for which /lscript=0)the wave function is spherically sym- metric, and the ﬁrst expectation value vanishes (see Problem 7.31). Meanwhile, from Equation 4.80 we ﬁnd that|ψ100(0)|2=1//parenleftbig πa3/parenrightbig ,s o E1 hf=μ0gpe2 3πmpmea3/angbracketleftbig Sp·Se/angbracketrightbig , (7.93) in the ground state. This is called spin-spin coupling , because it involves the dot product of two spins (contrast spin-orbit coupling, which involves S·L). In the presence of spin-spin coupling, the individual spin angular momenta are no longer conserved; the “good” states are eigenvectors of the total spin, S≡Se+Sp. (7.94) As before, we square this out to get Sp·Se=1 2/parenleftBig S2−S2 e−S2 p/parenrightBig . (7.95) But the electron and proton both have spin 1/2, so S2 e=S2 p=(3/4)/planckover2pi12. In the triplet state (spins “parallel”) the total spin is 1, and hence S2=2/planckover2pi12; in the singlet state the total spin is 0, andS2=0. Thus E1 hf=4gp/planckover2pi14 3mpm2ec2a4/braceleftBigg +1/4,(triplet); −3/4,(singlet).(7.96) Spin-spin coupling breaks the spin degeneracy of the ground state, lifting the triplet conﬁguration and depressing the singlet (see Figure 7.12). The energy gap is /Delta1E=4gp/planckover2pi14 3mpm2ec2a4=5.88×10−6eV.

Problem 7.32 By appropriate modiﬁcation of the hydrogen formula, determine the hyper- ﬁne splitting in the ground state of (a) muonic hydrogen (in which a muon—same charge andg-factor as the electron, but 207 times the mass—substitutes for the electron), (b) positronium (in which a positron—same mass and g-factor as the electron, but oppo- site charge—substitutes for the proton), and (c) muonium (in which an anti-muon—same mass and g-factor as a muon, but opposite charge—substitutes for the proton). Hint: Don’t forget to use the reduced mass (Problem 5.1) in calculating the “Bohr radius” of these exotic “atoms,” but use the actual masses in the gyromagnetic ratios. Incidentally, the answer you get for positronium (4.82×10−4eV) is quite far from the experimental value (8.41×10−4eV); the large discrepancy is due to pair annihilation/parenleftbig e++e−→γ+γ/parenrightbig , which contributes an extra (3/4)/Delta1E, and does not occur (of course) in ordinary hydrogen, muonic hydrogen, or muonium.30 FURTHER PROBLEMS ON CHAPTER 7 Problem 7.33 Estimate the correction to the ground state energy of hydrogen due to the ﬁnite size of the nucleus. Treat the proton as a uniformly charged spherical shell of radius b, so the potential energy of an electron inside the shell is constant: −e2/(4π/epsilon10b); this isn’t very realistic, but it is the simplest model, and it will give us the right order of magnitude. Expand your result in powers of the small parameter (b/a), where ais the Bohr radius, and keep only the leading term, so your ﬁnal answer takes the form /Delta1E E=A(b/a)n. Your business is to determine the constant Aand the power n. Finally, put in b≈ 10−15m (roughly the radius of the proton) and work out the actual number. How does it compare with ﬁne structure and hyperﬁne structure? 30For details see Grifﬁths, footnote 29,p a g e 311.314 CHAPTER 7 Time-Independent Perturbation Theory Problem 7.34 In this problem you will develop an alternative approach to degenerate per- turbation theory. Consider an unperturbed Hamiltonian H0with two degenerate states ψ0 aandψ0 b(energy E0), and a perturbation H/prime. Deﬁne the operator that projects31 onto the degenerate subspace: PD=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 a/angbracketrightBig/angbracketleftBig ψ0 a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle+/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 b/angbracketrightBig/angbracketleftBig ψ0 b/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle. (7.100) The Hamiltonian can be written H=H0+H/prime=˜H0+˜H/prime(7.101) where ˜H0=H0+PDH/primePD,˜H/prime=H/prime−PDH/primePD. (7.102) The idea is to treat ˜H0as the “unperturbed” Hamiltonian and ˜H/primeas the perturbation; as you’ll soon discover, ˜H0is nondegenerate, so we can use ordinary nondegenerate perturbation theory. (a)First we need to ﬁnd the eigenstates of ˜H0. i.Show that any eigenstate ψ0 n(other thanψ0 aorψ0 b)ofH0is also an eigenstate of˜H0with the same eigenvalue. ii.Show that the “good” states ψ0=αψ0 a+βψ0 b(withαandβdetermined by solving Equation 7.30) are eigenstates of ˜H0with energies E0+E1 ±. (b)Assuming that E1 +andE1 −are distinct, you now have a nondegenerate unperturbed Hamiltonian˜H0and you can do nondegenerate perturbation theory using the per- turbation˜H/prime. Find an expression for the energy to second order for the states ψ0 ± in (ii). Comment : One advantage of this approach is that it also handles the case where the unperturbed energies are not exactly equal, but very close:32E0 a≈E0 b.I n this case one must still use degenerate perturbation theory; an important example of this occurs in the nearly-free electron approximation for calculating band structure.33 Problem 7.35 Here is an application of the technique developed in Problem 7.34. Consider the Hamiltonian H0=⎛ ⎝/epsilon100 0/epsilon10 00/epsilon1/prime⎞ ⎠,H/prime=⎛ ⎝0 ab a∗0c b∗c∗0⎞ ⎠. (a)Find the projection operator PD(it’s a 3×3 matrix) that projects onto the subspace spanned by /vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 a/angbracketrightBig =⎛ ⎝1 0 0⎞ ⎠and/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 b/angbracketrightBig =⎛ ⎝0 1 0⎞ ⎠. Then construct the matrices ˜H0and˜H/prime. 31See page 118for a discussion of projection operators. 32See Problem 7.4for a discussion of what close means in this context. 33See, for example, Steven H. Simon, The Oxford Solid State Basics (Oxford University Press, 2013), Section 15.1.Further Problems on Chapter 7 315 (b)Solve for the eigenstates of ˜H0and verify. . . i.that its spectrum is nondegenerate, ii.that the nondegenerate eigenstate of H0 /vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0 c/angbracketrightBig =⎛ ⎝0 0 1⎞ ⎠ is also an eigenstate of ˜H0with the same eigenvalue. (c)What are the “good” states, and what are their energies, to ﬁrst order in the perturbation? Problem 7.36 Consider the isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator (Problem 4.46). Discuss the effect (in ﬁrst order) of the perturbation H/prime=λx2yz (for some constant λ)on (a)the ground state; (b)the (triply degenerate) ﬁrst excited state. Hint: Use the answers to Problems 2.12 and 3.39. ∗∗∗ Problem 7.37 Van der Waals interaction. Consider two atoms a distance Rapart. Because they are electrically neutral you might suppose there would be no force between them, but if they are polarizable there is in fact a weak attraction. To model this system, picture each atom as an electron (mass m, charge−e)attached by a spring (spring constant k)to the nucleus (charge +e), as in Figure 7.13. We’ll assume the nuclei are heavy, and essentially motionless. The Hamiltonian for the unperturbed system is H0=1 2mp2 1+1 2kx2 1+1 2mp2 2+1 2kx2 (7.103) The Coulomb interaction between the atoms is H/prime=1 4π/epsilon10/parenleftbigge2 R−e2 R−x1−e2 R+x2+e2 R−x1+x2/parenrightbigg .

(a)Prove the Feynman–Hellmann theorem. Hint: Use Equation 7.9. (b)Apply it to the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, (i) using λ=ω(this yields a formula for the expectation value of V), (ii) usingλ=/planckover2pi1(this yields/angbracketleftT/angbracketright), and (iii) usingλ=m(this yields a relation between /angbracketleftT/angbracketrightand/angbracketleftV/angbracketright). Compare your answers to Problem 2.12, and the virial theorem predictions (Problem 3.37). 34There is an interesting fraud in this well-known problem. If you expand H/primeto order 1/R5, the extra term has a nonzero expectation value in the ground state of H0, so there is a nonzero ﬁrst-order perturbation, and the dominant contribution goes like 1 /R5, not 1/R6. The model gets the power “right” in three dimensions (where the expectation value is zero), but not in one. See A. C. Ipsen and K. Splittorff, A m .J .P h y s . 83, 150 (2015). 35Feynman obtained Equation 7.110 while working on his undergraduate thesis at MIT (R. P. Feynman, Phys. Rev. 56, 340, 1939); Hellmann’s work was published four years earlier in an obscure Russian journal.Further Problems on Chapter 7 317 Problem 7.39 Consider a three-level system with the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0=⎛ ⎝/epsilon1a00 0/epsilon1a0 00/epsilon1c⎞ ⎠ (7.111) (/epsilon1a>/epsilon1 c)and the perturbation H/prime=⎛ ⎝00 V 00 V V∗V∗0⎞ ⎠. (7.112) Since the(2×2)matrix Wis diagonal (and in fact identically 0 )in the basis of states (1,0,0)and(0,1,0), you might assume they are the good states, but they’re not. To see this: (a)Obtain the exact eigenvalues for the perturbed Hamiltonian H=H0+H/prime. (b)Expand your results from part (a) as a power series in |V|up to second order. (c)What do you obtain by applying nondegenerate perturbation theory to ﬁnd the energies of all three states (up to second order)? This would work if the assumption about the good states above were correct. Moral : If any of the eigenvalues of Ware equal, the states that diagonalize Ware not unique, and diagonalizing Wdoes not determine the “good” states. When this happens (and it’s not uncommon), you need to use second -order degenerate perturbation theory (see Problem 7.40). Problem 7.40 If it happens that the square root in Equation 7.33 vanishes, then E1 +=E1 −; the degeneracy is not lifted at ﬁrst order. In this case, diagonalizing the Wmatrix puts no restriction on αandβand you still don’t know what the “good” states are. If you need to determine the “good” states—for example to calculate higher-order corrections—you need to use second-order degenerate perturbation theory .

Note: you might recognize the “good” states from Problem 4.71. Problem 7.49 A hydrogen atom is placed in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B0=B0ˆz(the Hamiltonian can be written as in Equation 4.230 ). Use the Feynman–Hellman theorem (Problem 7.38) to show that ∂En ∂B0=−/angbracketleftψn|μz|ψn/angbracketright (7.114) where the electron’s magnetic dipole moment40(orbital plus spin) is μ=γoLmechanical+γS. The mechanical angular momentum is deﬁned in Equation 4.231 . Note: From Equation 7.114 it follows that the magnetic susceptibility of Natoms in a volume Vand at 0 K (when they’re all in the ground state) is41 χ=μ0∂M ∂B0=−N Vμ0∂2E0 ∂B2 0, (7.115) where E0is the ground-state energy. Although we derived Equation 7.114 for a hydrogen atom, the expression applies to multi-electron atoms as well—even when electron–electron interactions are included.

The proton’s larger mass means that its contribution to the dipole moment is orders of magnitude smaller than the electron’s contribution. 41See Problem 5.33 for the deﬁnition of magnetic susceptibility. This formula does not apply when the ground state is degenerate (see Neil W. Ashcroft and N. David Mermin, Solid State Physics (Belmont: Cengage, 1976), p. 655); atoms with non-degenerate ground states have J=0 (see Table 5.1).322 CHAPTER 7 Time-Independent Perturbation Theory (a)Treating the terms involving B0as a perturbation, compute the shift of the ground state energy of a helium atom to second order in B0. Assume that the helium ground state is given by ψ0=ψ100(r1)ψ100(r2)|↑↓/angbracketright−|↓↑/angbracketright√ 2 whereψ100refers to the hydrogenic ground state (with Z=2). (b)Use the results of Problem 7.49 to calculate the magnetic susceptibility of helium. Given a density of 0 .166 kg/m3, obtain a numerical value for the susceptibility. Note: The experimental result is −1.0×10−9(the negative sign means that helium is adiamagnet ). The results can be brought closer by taking account of screening, which increases the orbital radius (see Section 8.2). ∗∗∗ Problem 7.51 Sometimes it is possible to solve Equation 7.10 directly, without having to expandψ1 nin terms of the unperturbed wave functions (Equation 7.11). Here are two particularly nice examples. (a)Stark effect in the ground state of hydrogen.

(c)Now solve the Schrödinger equation exactly, treating separately the regions 0 ≤ x<x0andx0<x<a, and imposing the boundary conditions at x0.

Verify that the solution only exists within the predicted range of p. (f)For p=1/2,plot the ground state wave function, ψ1(x),f o r/Lambda1= 0,−2,−3,−3.5,−4.5,−5, and−10, to show how the sinusoidal shape (Fig- ure2.2) evolves into the exponential shape (Figure 2.13), as the delta function well “deepens.”43 ∗∗∗ Problem 7.54 Suppose you want to calculate the expectation value of some observable /Omega1, in the nth energy eigenstate of a system that is perturbed by H/prime: /angbracketleft/Omega1/angbracketright=/angbracketleftBig ψn/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆ/Omega1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψn/angbracketrightBig . 42We adopt the notation of Y .

Comment: As the temperature increases, higher-energy states are populated, and the particles move farther (on average) from their equilibrium positions; that’s why most solids expand with rising temperature. Problem 7.55 Crandall’s Puzzle.46Stationary states of the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation ordinarily respect three “rules of thumb”: (1) the energies are nondegenerate, 44In general, Equation 7.5does not deliver a normalized wave function, but the choice c(n) n=0 in Equation 7.11 guarantees normalization to ﬁrst order in λ, which is all we require here (see footnote 4,p a g e 282). 45This is just a generic tweak to the simple harmonic oscillator potential,1 2kx2;κis some constant, and the factor of−1/6 is for convenience. 46Richard Crandall introduced me to this problem.Further Problems on Chapter 7 325 (2) the ground state has no nodes, the ﬁrst excited state has one node, the second has two, and so on, and (3) if the potential is an even function of x, the ground state is even, the ﬁrst excited state is odd, the second is even, and so on. We have already seen that the “bead-on-a-ring” (Problem 2.46) violates the ﬁrst of these; now suppose we introduce a “nick” in at the origin: H/prime=−αδ(x). (If you don’t like the delta function, make it a gaussian, as in Problem 7.9.) This lifts the degeneracy, but what is the sequence of even and odd wave functions, and what is the sequence of node numbers? Hint: You don’t really need to do any calcula- tions, here, and you’re welcome to assume that αis small, but by all means solve the Schrödinger equation exactly if you prefer. ∗∗∗ Problem 7.56 In this problem we treat the electron–electron repulsion term in the helium Hamiltonian (Equation 5.38) as a perturbation, H/prime=1 4π/epsilon10e2 |r1−r2|. (This will not be very accurate, because the perturbation is not small, in comparison to the Coulomb attraction of the nucleus ...b u ti t ’ sas t a r t . ) (a)Find the ﬁrst-order correction to the ground state, ψ0(r1,r2)=ψ100(r1)ψ100(r2). (You have already done this calculation, if you worked Problem 5.15—only we didn’t call it perturbation theory back then.) (b)Now treat the ﬁrst excited state, in which one electron is in the hydrogenic ground state,ψ100, and the other is in the state ψ200. Actually, there are twosuch states, depending on whether the electron spins occupy the singlet conﬁguration (parahelium) or the triplet (orthohelium):47 ψ±(r1,r2)=1√ 2[ψ100(r1)ψ200(r2)±ψ200(r1)ψ100(r2)]. Show that E1 ±=1 2(K±J), where K≡2/integraldisplay ψ100(r1)ψ200(r2)H/primeψ100(r1)ψ200(r2)d3r1d3r2, J≡2/integraldisplay ψ100(r1)ψ200(r2)H/primeψ200(r1)ψ100(r2)d3r1d3r2. Evaluate these two integrals, put in the actual numbers, and compare your results with Figure 5.2(the measured energies are −59.2 eV and−58.4e V ) .48 47It seems strange, at ﬁrst glance, that spin has anything to do with it, since the perturbation itself doesn’t involve spin (and I’m not even bothering to include the spin state explicitly). The point, of course, is that an antisymmetric spin state forces a symmetric (position) wave function, and vice versa, and this does affect the result. 48If you want to pursue this problem further, see R. C. Massé and T. G. Walker, A m .J .P h y s . 83, 730 (2015).326 CHAPTER 7 Time-Independent Perturbation Theory Problem 7.57 The Hamiltonian for the Bloch functions (Equation 6.12) can be analyzed with perturbation theory by deﬁning H0andH/primesuch that H0un0=En0un0, /parenleftbig H0+H/prime/parenrightbig unq=Enqunq. In this problem, don’t assume anything about the form of V(x). (a)Determine the operators H0andH/prime(express them in terms of ˆp). (b)Find Enqto second order in q. That is, ﬁnd expressions for An,Bn, and Cn(in terms of the En0and matrix elements of ˆpin the “unperturbed” states un0) Enq≈An+Bnq+Cnq2. (c)Show that the constants Bnare all zero. Hint: See Problem 2.1(b) to get started. Remember that un0(x)is periodic. Comment : It is conventional to write Cn=/planckover2pi12/2m∗ nwhere m∗ nis the effective mass of particles in the nth band since then, as you’ve just shown, Enq≈constant+/planckover2pi12q2 2m∗n just like the free particle (Equation 2.92) with k→q.8THE VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLE 8.1 THEORY Suppose you want to calculate the ground state energy, Egs, for a system described by the Hamiltonian H, but you are unable to solve the (time-independent) Schrödinger equation. The variational principle will get you an upper bound forEgs, which is sometimes all you need, and often, if you’re clever about it, very close to the exact value. Here’s how it works: Pick any normalized function ψwhatsoever ; I claim that Egs≤/angbracketleftψ|H|ψ/angbracketright≡/angbracketleftH/angbracketright. (8.1) That is, the expectation value of H, in the (presumably incorrect) state ψis certain to overesti- mate the ground state energy. Of course, if ψjust happens to be one of the excited states, then obviously/angbracketleftH/angbracketrightexceeds Egs; the point is that the same holds for any ψwhatsoever. Proof: Since the (unknown) eigenfunctions of Hform a complete set, we can express ψas a linear combination of them:1 ψ=/summationdisplay ncnψn,with Hψn=Enψn. Sinceψis normalized, 1=/angbracketleftψ|ψ/angbracketright=/angbracketleftBigg/summationdisplay mcmψm/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/summationdisplay ncnψn/angbracketrightBigg =/summationdisplay m/summationdisplay nc∗ mcn/angbracketleftψm|ψn/angbracketright=/summationdisplay n|cn|2, (assuming the eigenfunctions themselves have been orthonormalized: /angbracketleftψm|ψn/angbracketright=δmn). Meanwhile, /angbracketleftH/angbracketright=/angbracketleftBigg/summationdisplay mcmψm/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/summationdisplay ncnψn/angbracketrightBigg =/summationdisplay m/summationdisplay nc∗ mEncn/angbracketleftψm|ψn/angbracketright=/summationdisplay nEn|cn|2. But the ground state energy is, by deﬁnition, the smallest eigenvalue, Egs≤En, and hence /angbracketleftH/angbracketright≥Egs/summationdisplay n|cn|2=Egs, which is what we were trying to prove. 1If the Hamiltonian admits scattering states, as well as bound states, then we’ll need an integral as well as a sum, but the argument is unchanged.328 CHAPTER 8 The Variational Principle This is hardly surprising. After all, ψmight be the actual wave function (at, say, t=0). If you measured the particle’s energy you’d be certain to get one of the eigenvalues of H, the smallest of which is Egs,s ot h e average of multiple measurements (/angbracketleftH/angbracketright)cannot be lower than Egs. Example 8.1 Suppose we want to ﬁnd the ground state energy for the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator: H=−/planckover2pi12 2md2 dx2+1 2mω2x2. Of course, we already know the exact answer in this case (Equation 2.62):Egs=(1/2)/planckover2pi1ω; but this makes it a good test of the method. We might pick as our “trial” wave function the gaussian, ψ(x)=Ae−bx2, (8.2) where bis a constant, and Ais determined by normalization: 1=|A|2/integraldisplay∞ −∞e−2bx2dx=|A|2/radicalbiggπ 2b⇒A=/parenleftbigg2b π/parenrightbigg1/4 . (8.3) Now /angbracketleftH/angbracketright=/angbracketleftT/angbracketright+/angbracketleftV/angbracketright, (8.4) where, in this case, /angbracketleftT/angbracketright=−/planckover2pi12 2m|A|2/integraldisplay∞ −∞e−bx2d2 dx2/parenleftBig e−bx2/parenrightBig dx=/planckover2pi12b 2m, (8.5) and /angbracketleftV/angbracketright=1 2mω2|A|2/integraldisplay∞ −∞e−2bx2x2dx=mω2 8b, so /angbracketleftH/angbracketright=/planckover2pi12b 2m+mω2 8b. (8.6) According to Equation 8.1, this exceeds Egsfor any b ; to get the tightest bound, let’s minimize/angbracketleftH/angbracketright: d db/angbracketleftH/angbracketright=/planckover2pi12 2m−mω2 8b2=0⇒b=mω 2/planckover2pi1. Putting this back into /angbracketleftH/angbracketright, we ﬁnd /angbracketleftH/angbracketrightmin=1 2/planckover2pi1ω. (8.7) In this case we hit the ground state energy right on the nose—because (obviously) I “just happened” to pick a trial function with precisely the form of the actual ground state (Equa- tion2.60). But the gaussian is very easy to work with, so it’s a popular trial function, even when it bears little resemblance to the true ground state.8.1 Theory 329 Example 8.2 Suppose we’re looking for the ground state energy of the delta function potential: H=−/planckover2pi12 2md2 dx2−αδ(x). Again, we already know the exact answer (Equation 2.132 ):Egs=− mα2/2/planckover2pi12.A s before, we’ll use a gaussian trial function (Equation 8.2). We’ve already determined the normalization, and calculated /angbracketleftT/angbracketright; all we need is /angbracketleftV/angbracketright=−α|A|2/integraldisplay∞ −∞e−2bx2δ(x)dx=−α/radicalbigg 2b π. Evidently /angbracketleftH/angbracketright=/planckover2pi12b 2m−α/radicalbigg 2b π, (8.8) and we know that this exceeds Egsfor all b. Minimizing it, d db/angbracketleftH/angbracketright=/planckover2pi12 2m−α√ 2πb=0⇒b=2m2α2 π/planckover2pi14. So /angbracketleftH/angbracketrightmin=−mα2 π/planckover2pi12, (8.9) which is indeed somewhat higher than Egs, sinceπ> 2. I said you can use any(normalized) trial function ψwhatsoever, and this is true in a sense. However, for discontinuous functions it takes some fancy footwork to assign a sensible mean- ing to the second derivative (which you need, in order to calculate /angbracketleftT/angbracketright). Continuous functions with kinks in them are fair game, however, as long as you are careful; the next example shows how to handle them.2 Example 8.3 Find an upper bound on the ground state energy of the one-dimensional inﬁnite square well (Equation 2.22), using the “triangular” trial wave function (Figure 8.1):3 ψ(x)=⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩Ax, 0≤x≤a/2, A(a−x),a/2≤x≤a, 0, otherwise,(8.10) where Ais determined by normalization: 1=|A|2/bracketleftBigg/integraldisplaya/2 0x2dx+/integraldisplaya a/2(a−x)2dx/bracketrightBigg =|A|2a3 12⇒A=2 a/radicalbigg 3 a. (8.11) 2For a collection of interesting examples see W. N. Mei, Int. J. Math. Educ. Sci. Tech. 30, 513 (1999). 3There is no point in trying a function (such as the gaussian) that extends outside the well, because you’ll get /angbracketleftV/angbracketright=∞ , and Equation 8.1tells you nothing.330 CHAPTER 8 The Variational Principle ψ(x) a/2 ax Figure 8.1: Triangular trial wave function for the inﬁnite square well (Equation 8.10). −AAdψ/dx a/2 a x Figure 8.2: Derivative of the wave function in Figure 8.1. In this case dψ dx=⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩A, 0≤x≤a/2, −A,a/2≤x≤a, 0, otherwise, as indicated in Figure 8.2. Now, the derivative of a step function is a delta function (see Problem 2.23(b)): d2ψ dx2=Aδ(x)−2Aδ(x−a/2)+Aδ(x−a), (8.12) and hence /angbracketleftH/angbracketright=−/planckover2pi12A 2m/integraldisplay/bracketleftbig δ(x)−2δ(x−a/2)+δ(x−a)/bracketrightbig ψ(x)dx =−/planckover2pi12A 2m/bracketleftbig ψ(0)−2ψ(a/2)+ψ(a)/bracketrightbig =/planckover2pi12A2a 2m=12/planckover2pi12 2ma2. (8.13) The exact ground state energy is Egs=π2/planckover2pi12/2ma2(Equation 2.30), so the theorem works/parenleftbig 12>π2/parenrightbig .8.1 Theory 331 Alternatively, you can exploit the hermiticity of ˆp: /angbracketleftH/angbracketright=1 2m/angbracketleftBig ˆp2/angbracketrightBig =1 2m/angbracketleftbig ˆpψ/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆpψ/angbracketrightbig =1 2m/integraldisplaya 0/parenleftbigg −i/planckover2pi1dψ dx/parenrightbigg∗/parenleftbigg −i/planckover2pi1dψ dx/parenrightbigg dx =/planckover2pi12 2m/bracketleftBigg/integraldisplaya/2 0(A)2dx+/integraldisplaya a/2(−A)2dx/bracketrightBigg =/planckover2pi12 2mA2a=12/planckover2pi12 2ma2. (8.14) The variational principle is extraordinarily powerful, and embarrassingly easy to use. What a physical chemist does, to ﬁnd the ground state energy of some complicated molecule, is write down a trial wave function with a large number of adjustable parameters, calculate /angbracketleftH/angbracketright, and tweak the parameters to get the lowest possible value. Even if ψhas little resemblance to the true wave function, you often get miraculously accurate values for Egs. Naturally, if you have some way of guessing a realisticψ, so much the better. The only trouble with the method is that you never know for sure how close you are to the target—all you can be certain of is that you’ve got an upper bound .4Moreover, as it stands the technique applies only to the ground state (see, however, Problem 8.4).5 ∗ Problem 8.1 Use a gaussian trial function (Equation 8.2) to obtain the lowest upper bound you can on the ground state energy of (a) the linear potential: V(x)=α|x|; (b) the quartic potential: V(x)=αx4. ∗∗ Problem 8.2 Find the best bound on Egsfor the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator using a trial wave function of the form ψ(x)=A x2+b2, where Ais determined by normalization and bis an adjustable parameter. Problem 8.3 Find the best bound on Egsfor the delta function potential V(x)=−αδ(x), using a triangular trial function (Equation 8.10, only centered at the origin). This time ais an adjustable parameter. Problem 8.4 (a)Prove the following corollary to the variational principle: If/angbracketleftbig ψ|ψgs/angbracketrightbig =0, then /angbracketleftH/angbracketright≥Efe, where Efeis the energy of the ﬁrst excited state. Comment: If we can ﬁnd a trial function that is orthogonal to the exact ground state, we can get 4In practice this isn’t much of a limitation, and there are sometimes ways of estimating the accuracy. The binding energy of helium has been calculated to many signiﬁcant digits in this way (see for example G. W. Drake et al. , Phys. Rev. A 65, 054501 (2002), or Vladimir I. Korobov, Phys. Rev. A 66, 024501 (2002). 5For a systematic extension of the variational principle to the calculation of excited state energies see, for example, Linus Pauling and E. Bright Wilson, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, With Applications to Chemistry ,M c G r a w - Hill, New York (1935, paperback edition 1985), Section 26.332 CHAPTER 8 The Variational Principle an upper bound on the ﬁrst excited state . In general, it’s difﬁcult to be sure that ψ is orthogonal to ψgs, since (presumably) we don’t know the latter. However, if the potential V(x)is an even function of x, then the ground state is likewise even, and hence any oddtrial function will automatically meet the condition for the corollary.6 (b)Find the best bound on the ﬁrst excited state of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator using the trial function ψ(x)=Axe−bx2. Problem 8.5 Using a trial function of your own devising, obtain an upper bound on the ground state energy for the “bouncing ball” potential (Equation 2.185 ), and compare it with the exact answer (Problem 2.59):Egs=2.33811/parenleftbig mg2/planckover2pi12/slashbig 2/parenrightbig1/3. Problem 8.6 (a)Use the variational principle to prove that ﬁrst-order non-degenerate perturbation theory always overestimates (or at any rate never underestimates ) the ground state energy. (b)In view of (a), you would expect that the second -order correction to the ground state is always negative. Conﬁrm that this is indeed the case, by examining Equation 7.15. 8.2 THE GROUND STATE OF HELIUM The helium atom (Figure 8.3) consists of two electrons in orbit around a nucleus containing two protons (also some neutrons, which are irrelevant to our purpose). The Hamiltonian for this system (ignoring ﬁne structure and smaller corrections) is: −e +2e−e|r1−r2| r1r2 Figure 8.3: The helium atom. 6You can extend this trick to other symmetries. Suppose there is a Hermitian operator Asuch that [A,H]=0. The ground state (assuming it is nondegenerate) must be an eigenstate of A; call the eigenvalue λ:Aψgs=λψgs.I f you choose a variational function ψthat is an eigenstate of Awith a different eigenvalue: Aψ=νψwithλ/negationslash=ν, you can be certain that ψandψgsare orthogonal (see Section 3.3). For an application see Problem 8.20.8.2 The Ground State of Helium 333 H=−/planckover2pi12 2m/parenleftBig ∇2 1+∇2 2/parenrightBig −e2 4π/epsilon10/parenleftbigg2 r1+2 r2−1 |r1−r2|/parenrightbigg . (8.15) Our problem is to calculate the ground state energy, Egs. Physically, this represents the amount of energy it would take to strip off both electrons. (Given Egsit is easy to ﬁgure out the “ionization energy” required to remove a single electron—see Problem 8.7.) The ground state energy of helium has been measured to great precision in the laboratory: Egs=−78.975 eV (experimental) . (8.16) This is the number we would like to reproduce theoretically. It is curious that such a simple and important problem has no known exact solution.7The trouble comes from the electron–electron repulsion, Vee=e2 4π/epsilon101 |r1−r2|. (8.17) If we ignore this term altogether, Hsplits into two independent hydrogen Hamiltonians (only with a nuclear charge of 2 e, instead of e); the exact solution is just the product of hydrogenic wave functions: ψ0(r1,r2)≡ψ100(r1)ψ100(r2)=8 πa3e−2(r1+r2)/a, (8.18) and the energy is 8 E1=−109 eV (Equation 5.42).8This is a long way from −79 eV , but it’s as t a r t . To get a better approximation for Egswe’ll apply the variational principle, using ψ0as the trial wave function. This is a particularly convenient choice because it’s an eigenfunction of most of the Hamiltonian: Hψ0=(8E1+Vee)ψ0. (8.19) Thus /angbracketleftH/angbracketright=8E1+/angbracketleftVee/angbracketright, (8.20) where9 /angbracketleftVee/angbracketright=/parenleftbigge2 4π/epsilon10/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg8 πa3/parenrightbigg2/integraldisplaye−4(r1+r2)/a |r1−r2|d3r1d3r2. (8.21) I’ll do the r2integral ﬁrst; for this purpose r1is ﬁxed, and we may as well orient the r2 coordinate system so that the polar axis lies along r1(see Figure 8.4). By the law of cosines, |r1−r2|=/radicalBig r2 1+r2 2−2r1r2cosθ2, (8.22) 7There do exist exactly soluble three-body problems with many of the qualitative features of helium, but using non-Coulombic potentials (see Problem 8.24). 8Here ais the ordinary Bohr radius and En=− 13.6/n2eV is the nth Bohr energy; recall that for a nucleus with atomic number Z,En→Z2Enanda→a/Z(Problem 4.19). The spin conﬁguration associated with Equation 8.18 will be antisymmetric (the singlet). 9You can, if you like, interpret Equation 8.21 as ﬁrst-order perturbation theory, with H/prime=Vee(Problem 7.56(a)). However, I regard this as a misuse of the method, since the perturbation is comparable in size to the unperturbed potential. I prefer, therefore, to think of it as a variational calculation, in which we are looking for a rigorous upper bound on Egs.334 CHAPTER 8 The Variational Principle |r1−r2| φ2θ2 r2r1z2 x2y2 Figure 8.4: Choice of coordinates for the r2-integral (Equation 8.21). and hence I2≡/integraldisplaye−4r2/a |r1−r2|d3r2=/integraldisplaye−4r2/a /radicalBig r2 1+r2 2−2r1r2cosθ2r2 2sinθ2dr2dθ2dφ2.

(8.27) Not bad (remember, the experimental value is −79 eV). But we can do better. We need to think up a more realistic trial function than ψ0(which treats the two electrons as though they did not interact at all). Rather than completely ignoring the inﬂuence of the other electron, let us say that, on the average, each electron represents a cloud of negative charge which partially shields the nucleus, so that the other electron actually sees an effective nuclear charge(Z)that is somewhat lessthan 2. This suggests that we use a trial function of the form ψ1(r1,r2)≡Z3 πa3e−Z(r1+r2)/a. (8.28) We’ll treat Zas a variational parameter, picking the value that minimizes /angbracketleftH/angbracketright. (Please note that in the variational method we never touch the Hamiltonian itself —the Hamiltonian for helium is, and remains, Equation 8.15. But it’s ﬁne to think about approximating the Hamiltonian as a way of motivating the choice of the trial wave function. ) This wave function is an eigenstate of the “unperturbed” Hamiltonian (neglecting electron repulsion), only with Z, instead of 2, in the Coulomb terms. With this in mind, we rewrite H (Equation 8.15) as follows: H=−/planckover2pi12 2m/parenleftBig ∇2 1+∇2 2/parenrightBig −e2 4π/epsilon10/parenleftbiggZ r1+Z r2/parenrightbigg +e2 4π/epsilon10/parenleftbigg(Z−2) r1+(Z−2) r2+1 |r1−r2|/parenrightbigg . (8.29) The expectation value of His evidently /angbracketleftH/angbracketright=2Z2E1+2(Z−2)/parenleftbigge2 4π/epsilon10/parenrightbigg/angbracketleftbigg1 r/angbracketrightbigg +/angbracketleftVee/angbracketright. (8.30) Here/angbracketleft1/r/angbracketrightis the expectation value of 1 /rin the (one-particle) hydrogenic ground state ψ100 (with nuclear charge Z); according to Equation 7.56, /angbracketleftbigg1 r/angbracketrightbigg =Z a. (8.31) The expectation value of Veeis the same as before (Equation 8.26), except that instead of Z=2 we now want arbitrary Z —so we multiply aby 2/Z: /angbracketleftVee/angbracketright=5Z 8a/parenleftbigge2 4π/epsilon10/parenrightbigg =−5Z 4E1. (8.32) Putting all this together, we ﬁnd /angbracketleftH/angbracketright=/bracketleftBig 2Z2−4Z(Z−2)−(5/4)Z/bracketrightBig E1=/bracketleftBig −2Z2+(27/4)Z/bracketrightBig E1. (8.33)336 CHAPTER 8 The Variational Principle According to the variational principle, this quantity exceeds Egsforanyvalue of Z.T h e lowest upper bound occurs when /angbracketleftH/angbracketrightis minimized: d dZ/angbracketleftH/angbracketright=/bracketleftbig −4Z+(27/4)/bracketrightbig E1=0, from which it follows that Z=27 16=1.69. (8.34) This seems reasonable; it tells us that the other electron partially screens the nucleus, reducing its effective charge from 2 down to about 1.69. Putting in this value for Z, we ﬁnd /angbracketleftH/angbracketright=1 2/parenleftbigg3 2/parenrightbigg6 E1=−77.5e V. (8.35) The ground state of helium has been calculated with great precision in this way, using increasingly complicated trial wave functions, with more and more adjustable parameters.10 But we’re within 2% of the correct answer, and, frankly, at this point my own interest in the problem begins to wane.11 Problem 8.7 Using Egs=− 79.0 eV for the ground state energy of helium, calculate the ionization energy (the energy required to remove just oneelectron). Hint: First calculate the ground state energy of the helium ion, He+, with a single electron orbiting the nucleus; then subtract the two energies. ∗ Problem 8.8 Apply the techniques of this Section to the H−and Li+ions (each has two electrons, like helium, but nuclear charges Z=1 and Z=3, respectively). Find the effective (partially shielded) nuclear charge, and determine the best upper bound on Egs, for each case. Comment: In the case of H−you should ﬁnd that /angbracketleftH/angbracketright>−13.6e V ,w h i c h would appear to indicate that there is no bound state at all, since it would be energetically favorable for one electron to ﬂy off, leaving behind a neutral hydrogen atom. This is not entirely surprising, since the electrons are less strongly attracted to the nucleus than they are in helium, and the electron repulsion tends to break the atom apart. However, it turns out to be incorrect. With a more sophisticated trial wave function (see Problem 8.25) it can be shown that Egs<−13.6 eV , and hence that a bound state does exist. It’s only barely bound, however, and there are no excited bound states,12so H−has no discrete spectrum (all transitions are to and from the continuum). As a result, it is difﬁcult to study in the laboratory, although it exists in great abundance on the surface of the sun.13 10The classic studies are E. A. Hylleraas, Z. Phys. 65, 209 (1930); C. L. Pekeris, Phys. Rev. 115, 1216 (1959). For more recent work, see footnote 4. 11The ﬁrst excited state of helium can be calculated in much the same way, using a trial wave function orthogonal to the ground state. See Phillip J. E. Peebles, Quantum Mechanics , Princeton U.P., Princeton, NJ (1992), Section 40. 12Robert N. Hill, J. Math. Phys. 18, 2316 (1977). 13For further discussion see Hans A. Bethe and Edwin E. Salpeter, Quantum Mechanics of One- and Two-Electron Atoms , Plenum, New York (1977), Section 34.8.3 The Hydrogen Molecule Ion 337 8.3 THE HYDROGEN MOLECULE ION Another classic application of the variational principle is to the hydrogen molecule ion, H+ 2, consisting of a single electron in the Coulomb ﬁeld of two protons (Figure 8.5). I shall assume for the moment that the protons are ﬁxed in position, a speciﬁed distance Rapart, although one of the most interesting byproducts of the calculation is going to be the actual value ofR.T h e Hamiltonian is H=−/planckover2pi12 2m∇2−e2 4π/epsilon10/parenleftbigg1 r+1 r/prime/parenrightbigg , (8.36) where randr/primeare the distances to the electron from the respective protons. As always, our strategy will be to guess a reasonable trial wave function, and invoke the variational principle to get a bound on the ground state energy. (Actually, our main interest is in ﬁnding out whether this system bonds at all—that is, whether its energy is less than that of a neutral hydrogen atom plus a free proton. If our trial wave function indicates that there isa bound state, a better trial function can only make the bonding even stronger.) To construct the trial wave function, imagine that the ion is formed by taking a hydrogen atom in its ground state (Equation 4.80), ψ0(r)=1√ πa3e−r/a, (8.37) bringing the second proton in from “inﬁnity,” and nailing it down a distance Raway. If Ris substantially greater than the Bohr radius, the electron’s wave function probably isn’t changed very much. But we would like to treat the two protons on an equal footing, so that the electron has the same probability of being associated with either one. This suggests that we consider a trial function of the form ψ=A/bracketleftbig ψ0(r)+ψ0/parenleftbig r/prime/parenrightbig/bracketrightbig . (8.38) (Quantum chemists call this the LCAO technique, because we are expressing the molecular wave function as a linear combination of atomic orbitals.)

(8.52) This function is plotted in Figure 8.7. Evidently bonding does occur, for there exists a region in which the graph goes below −1, indicating that the energy is less than that of a neutral atom plus a free proton (−13.6e V ) .I t ’ sa covalent bond , with the electron shared equally by the two protons. The equilibrium separation of the protons is about 2.4 Bohr radii, or 1.3 Å (the experimental value is 1.06 Å). The calculated binding energy is 1.8 eV , whereas the exper- imental value is 2.8 eV (the variational principle, as always, over estimates the ground state energy—and hence under estimates the strength of the bond—but never mind: The essential point was to see whether binding occurs at all; a better variational function can only make the potential well even deeper. ∗ Problem 8.9 Evaluate DandX(Equations 8.46 and8.47). Check your answers against Equations 8.48 and8.49. ∗∗ Problem 8.10 Suppose we used a minus sign in our trial wave function (Equation 8.38): ψ=A/bracketleftbig ψ0(r)−ψ0/parenleftbig r/prime/parenrightbig/bracketrightbig . (8.53) Without doing any new integrals, ﬁnd F(x)(the analog to Equation 8.52) for this case, and construct the graph. Show that there is no evidence of bonding.14(Since the variational principle only gives an upper bound , this doesn’t prove that bonding cannot occur for such a state, but it certainly doesn’t look promising.) 14The wave function with the plus sign (Equation 8.38) is called the bonding orbital . Bonding is associated with a buildup of electron probability in between the two nuclei. The odd linear combination (Equation 8.53)h a sa node at the center, so it’s not surprising that this conﬁguration doesn’t lead to bonding; it is called the anti-bonding orbital .8.4 The Hydrogen Molecule 341 ∗∗∗ Problem 8.11 The second derivative of F(x), at the equilibrium point, can be used to esti- mate the natural frequency of vibration (ω)of the two protons in the hydrogen molecule ion (see Section 2.3). If the ground state energy (/planckover2pi1ω/2)of this oscillator exceeds the bind- ing energy of the system, it will ﬂy apart. Show that in fact the oscillator energy is small enough that this will nothappen, and estimate how many bound vibrational levels there are.Note: You’re not going to be able to obtain the position of the minimum—still less the second derivative at that point—analytically. Do it numerically, on a computer. 8.4 THE HYDROGEN MOLECULE Now consider the hydrogen molecule itself, adding a second electron to the hydrogen molecule ion we studied in Section 8.3. Taking the two protons to be at rest, the Hamiltonian is ˆH=−/planckover2pi12 2m/parenleftBig ∇2 1+∇2 2/parenrightBig +e2 4π/epsilon10/parenleftbigg1 r12+1 R−1 r1−1 r/prime 1−1 r2−1 r/prime 2/parenrightbigg (8.54) where r1andr/prime 1are the distances of electron 1 from each proton and r2andr/prime 2are the dis- tances of electron 2 from each proton; as shown in Figure 8.8. The six potential energy terms describe the repulsion between the two electrons, the repulsion between the two protons, and the attraction of each electron to each proton. For the variational wave function, associate one electron with each proton, and symmetrize: ψ+(r1,r2)=A+/bracketleftbig ψ0(r1)ψ0/parenleftbig r/prime 2/parenrightbig +ψ0/parenleftbig r/prime 1/parenrightbig ψ0(r2)/bracketrightbig . (8.55) We’ll calculate the normalization A+in a moment. Since this spatial wave function is sym- metric under interchange, the electrons must occupy the antisymmetric (singlet) spin state. Of course, we could also choose the trial wave function ψ−(r1,r2)=A−/bracketleftbig ψ0(r1)ψ0/parenleftbig r/prime 2/parenrightbig −ψ0/parenleftbig r/prime 1/parenrightbig ψ0(r2)/bracketrightbig (8.56) in which case the electrons would be in a symmetric (triplet) spin state. These two variational wave functions constitute the Heitler–London approximation .15It is not obvious which of Rr′1 r1 r2r/prime 2r12 +e +e−e −e Figure 8.8: Diagram of H 2showing the distances on which the potential energy depends. 15W.

(8.60) To calculate the expectation value of the energy, we will start with the kinetic energy of particle 1. Since ψ0is the ground state of the hydrogen Hamiltonian, the same trick that brought us to Equation 8.45 gives −/planckover2pi12 2m∇2 1ψ±=A±/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg −/planckover2pi12 2m∇2 1ψ0(r1)/parenrightbigg ψ0/parenleftbig r/prime 2/parenrightbig ±/parenleftbigg −/planckover2pi12 2m∇2 1ψ0/parenleftbig r/prime 1/parenrightbig/parenrightbigg ψ0(r2)/bracketrightbigg =A±/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg E1+e2 4π/epsilon10r1/parenrightbigg ψ0(r1)ψ0/parenleftbig r/prime 2/parenrightbig ±/parenleftbigg E1+e2 4π/epsilon10r/prime 1/parenrightbigg ψ0/parenleftbig r/prime 1/parenrightbig ψ0(r2)/bracketrightbigg =E1ψ±+e2 4π/epsilon10aA±/parenleftbigga r1ψ0(r1)ψ0/parenleftbig r/prime 2/parenrightbig ±a r/prime 1ψ0/parenleftbig r/prime 1/parenrightbig ψ0(r2)/parenrightbigg .

If you expand this function you’ll see that half the terms—such as ψ0(r1)ψ0(r2)—involve attaching two electrons to the same proton, which is energetically costly because of the electron–electron repulsion in Equation 8.54. The Heitler–London approximation, Equation 8.55, amounts to dropping the offending terms from Equation 8.57.8.4 The Hydrogen Molecule 343 ±/angbracketleftbigg ψ0(r1)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglea r/prime 1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0/parenleftbig r/prime 1/parenrightbig/angbracketrightbigg/angbracketleftbig ψ0/parenleftbig r/prime 2/parenrightbig/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0(r2)/angbracketrightbig +/angbracketleftbigg ψ0/parenleftbig r/prime 1/parenrightbig/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglea r/prime 1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψ0/parenleftbig r/prime 1/parenrightbig/angbracketrightbigg /angbracketleftψ0(r2)|ψ0(r2)/angbracketright/bracketrightbigg .

(8.62) The kinetic energy of particle 2 is of course the same, so the total kinetic energy is simply twice Equation 8.62.

(8.67) The evaluation of these integrals is discussed in Problem 8.14. Note that the integral D2is just the electrostatic potential energy of two charge distributions ρ1=|ψ0(r1)|2andρ2= |ψ0(r2)|2. The exchange term X2has no such classical counterpart. When we add all of the contributions to the energy—the kinetic energy, the electron–proton potential energy, the electron–electron potential energy, and the proton–proton potential energy (which is a constant, e2/4π/epsilon10R)—we get344 CHAPTER 8 The Variational Principle /angbracketleftH/angbracketright±=2E1/bracketleftbigg 1−a R+2D−D2±(2IX−X2) 1±I2/bracketrightbigg . (8.68) Ap l o to f/angbracketleftH/angbracketright+and/angbracketleftH/angbracketright−is shown in Figure 8.9. Recall that the state ψ+requires placing the two electrons in the singlet spin conﬁguration, whereas ψ−means putting them in a triplet spin conﬁguration. According to the ﬁgure, bonding only occurs if the two electrons are in a singlet conﬁguration—something that is conﬁrmed experimentally. Again, it’s a covalent bond. Locating the minimum on the plot, our calculation predicts a bond length of 1 .64 Bohr radii (the experimental value is 1 .40 Bohr radii), and suggests a binding energy of 3.15 eV (whereas the experimental value is 4.75 eV). The trends here follow those of the Hydrogen molecule ion: the calculation overestimates the bond length and underestimates the binding energy, but the agreement is surprisingly good for a variational calculation with no adjustable parameters. The difference between the singlet and triplet energies is called the exchange splitting J. In the Heitler–London approximation it is J=/angbracketleftH/angbracketright+−/angbracketleftH/angbracketright−=4E1(D2−2D)I2−(X2−2IX) 1−I4, (8.69) which is roughly −10 eV (negative because the singlet is lower in energy) at the equilibrium separation. This means a strong preference for having the electron spins anti-aligned. But in this treatment of H 2we’ve left out completely the (magnetic) spin–spin interaction between the electrons—remember that the spin–spin interaction between the proton and the electron is what leads to hyperﬁne splitting (Section 7.5). Were we right to ignore it here? Absolutely: applying Equation 7.92 to two electrons a distance Rapart, the energy of the spin–spin interaction is something like 10−4eV in this system, ﬁve orders of magnitude smaller than the exchange splitting. 1 2 33 4 5 6R/a –2.5–2.0–1.5–1.0–0.5ááH E1 Figure 8.9: The total energy of the singlet (solid curve) and triplet (dashed curve) states for H 2, as a func- tion of the separation Rbetween the protons. The singlet state has a minimum at around 1.6 Bohr radii, representing a stable bond. The triplet state is unstable and will dissociate, as the energy is minimized for R→∞ .8.4 The Hydrogen Molecule 345 This calculation shows us that different spin conﬁgurations can have very different energies, even when the interaction between the spins is negligible. And that helps us understand fer- romagnetism (where the spins in a material align) and anti-ferromagnetism (where the spins alternate). As we’ve just seen, the spin–spin interaction is waytoo weak to account for this— but the exchange splitting isn’t. Counterintuitively, it’s not a magnetic interaction that accounts for ferromagnetism, but an electrostatic one! H 2is a sort of inchoate anti-ferromagnet where the Hamiltonian, which is independent of the spin, selects a certain spatial ground state and thespin state comes along for the ride, to satisfy the Fermi statistics. Problem 8.12 Show that the antisymmetric state (Equation 8.56) can be expressed in terms of the molecular orbitals of Section 8.3—speciﬁcally, by placing one electron in the bonding orbital (Equation 8.38) and one in the anti-bonding orbital (Equation 8.53).

(8.72) ∗ Problem 8.15 Make a plot of the kinetic energy for both the singlet and triplet states of H2, as a function of R/a. Do the same for the electron-proton potential energy and for the electron–electron potential energy. You should ﬁnd that the triplet state has lower potential energy than the singlet state for all values of R. However, the singlet state’s kinetic energy issomuch smaller that its total energy comes out lower. Comment : In situations where there is not a large kinetic energy cost to aligning the spins, such as two electrons in a partially ﬁlled orbital in an atom, the triplet state can come out lower in energy. This is the physics behind Hund’s ﬁrst rule.

Now we turn on a perturbation H/prime, with the following matrix elements: /angbracketleftbig ψa/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψa/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbig ψb/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψb/angbracketrightbig =0;/angbracketleftbig ψa/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψb/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbig ψb/vextendsingle/vextendsingleH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψa/angbracketrightbig =h,(8.74) where his some speciﬁed constant. (a)Find the exact eigenvalues of the perturbed Hamiltonian. (b)Estimate the energies of the perturbed system using second-order perturbation theory. (c)Estimate the ground state energy of the perturbed system using the variational principle, with a trial function of the form ψ=(cosφ)ψa+(sinφ)ψb, (8.75) whereφis an adjustable parameter. Note: Writing the linear combination in this way is just a neat way to guarantee that ψis normalized. (d)Compare your answers to (a), (b), and (c). Why is the variational principle so accurate, in this case? Problem 8.23 As an explicit example of the method developed in Problem 8.22, consider an electron at rest in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B=Bzˆk, for which the Hamiltonian is (Equation 4.158 ): H0=eBz mSz. (8.76) The eigenspinors, χaandχb, and the corresponding energies, EaandEb,a r eg i v e ni n Equation 4.161 . Now we turn on a perturbation, in the form of a uniform ﬁeld in the xdirection: H/prime=eBx mSx. (8.77) (a)Find the matrix elements of H/prime, and conﬁrm that they have the structure of Equation 8.74. What is h? (b)Using your result in Problem 8.22(b), ﬁnd the new ground state energy, in second- order perturbation theory. (c)Using your result in Problem 8.22(c), ﬁnd the variational principle bound on the ground state energy. ∗∗∗ Problem 8.24 Although the Schrödinger equation for helium itself cannot be solved exactly, there exist “helium-like” systems that do admit exact solutions. A simple example19is “rubber-band helium,” in which the Coulomb forces are replaced by Hooke’s law forces: 19For a more sophisticated model, see R. Crandall, R. Whitnell, and R. Bettega, Am. J. Phys 52, 438 (1984).Further Problems on Chapter 8 349 H=−/planckover2pi12 2m/parenleftBig ∇2 1+∇2 2/parenrightBig +1 2mω2/parenleftBig r2 1+r2 2/parenrightBig −λ 4mω2|r1−r2|2.

(8.80) (b)What is the exact ground state energy for this system? (c)If we didn’t know the exact solution, we might be inclined to apply the method of Section 8.2to the Hamiltonian in its original form (Equation 8.78). Do so (but don’t bother with shielding). How does your result compare with the exact answer? Answer:/angbracketleftH/angbracketright=3/planckover2pi1ω(1−λ/4). ∗∗∗ Problem 8.25 In Problem 8.8we found that the trial wave function with shielding (Equa- tion8.28), which worked well for helium, is inadequate to conﬁrm the existence of a bound state for the negative hydrogen ion. Chandrasekhar20used a trial wave function of the form ψ(r1,r2)≡A[ψ1(r1)ψ2(r2)+ψ2(r1)ψ1(r2)], (8.81) where ψ1(r)≡/radicalBigg Z3 1 πa3e−Z1r/a,andψ2(r)≡/radicalBigg Z3 2 πa3e−Z2r/a. (8.82) In effect, he allowed two different shielding factors, suggesting that one electron is relatively close to the nucleus, and the other is farther out. (Because electrons are identical particles, the spatial wave function must be symmetrized with respect to interchange. The spin state—which is irrelevant to the calculation—is evidently anti- symmetric.) Show that by astute choice of the adjustable parameters Z1andZ2you can get/angbracketleftH/angbracketrightless than−13.6e V . Answer: /angbracketleftH/angbracketright=E1 x6+y6/parenleftbigg −x8+2x7+1 2x6y2−1 2x5y2−1 8x3y4+11 8xy6−1 2y8/parenrightbigg , where x≡Z1+Z2andy≡2√Z1Z2. Chandrasekhar used Z1=1.039 (since this is larger than 1, the motivating interpretation as an effective nuclear charge cannot be sustained, but never mind—it’s still an acceptable trial wave function) and Z2= 0.283. Problem 8.26 The fundamental problem in harnessing nuclear fusion is getting the two particles (say, two deuterons) close enough together for the attractive (but short-range) nuclear force to overcome the Coulomb repulsion. The “bulldozer” method is to heat 20S. Chandrasekhar, Astrophys. J. 100, 176 (1944).350 CHAPTER 8 The Variational Principle the particles up to fantastic temperatures, and allow the random collisions to bring them together. A more exotic proposal is muon catalysis , in which we construct a “hydrogen molecule ion,” only with deuterons in place of protons, and a muon in place of the electron. Predict the equilibrium separation distance between the deuterons in such a structure, and explain why muons are superior to electrons for this purpose.21 ∗∗∗ Problem 8.27 Quantum dots. Consider a particle constrained to move in two dimensions in the cross-shaped region shown in Figure 8.10. The “arms” of the cross continue out to inﬁnity. The potential is zero within the cross, and inﬁnite in the shaded areas outside. Surprisingly, this conﬁguration admits a positive-energy bound state.22 xy a −aa −a Figure 8.10: The cross-shaped region for Problem 8.27. (a)Show that the lowest energy that can propagate off to inﬁnity is Ethreshold=π2/planckover2pi12 8ma2; any solution with energy lessthan that has to be a bound state. Hint: Go way out one arm (say, x/greatermucha), and solve the Schrödinger equation by separation of variables; if the wave function propagates out to inﬁnity, the dependence on x must take the form exp (ikxx)with kx>0. 21The classic paper on muon-catalyzed fusion is J. D. Jackson, Phys. Rev. 106, 330 (1957); for a more recent popular review, see J. Rafelski and S. Jones, Scientiﬁc American , November 1987, page 84. 22This model is taken from R. L. Schult et al. ,P h y s .R e v .B 39, 5476 (1989). For further discussion see J. T. Londergan and D. P. Murdock, A m .J .P h y s . 80, 1085 (2012). In the presence of quantum tunneling a classically bound state can become unbound; this is the reverse: A classically unbound state is quantum mechanically bound .Further Problems on Chapter 8 351 (b)Now use the variational principle to show that the ground state has energy less than Ethreshold . Use the following trial wave function (suggested by Jim McTavish): ψ(x,y)=A⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩/bracketleftbig cos(πx/2a)+cos(πy/2a)/bracketrightbig e−α,|x|≤aand|y|≤a cos(πx/2a)e−α|y|/a, |x|≤aand|y|>a cos(πy/2a)e−α|x|/a, |x|>aand|y|≤a 0, elsewhere. Normalize it to determine A, and calculate the expectation value of H.Answer: /angbracketleftH/angbracketright=/planckover2pi12 ma2/bracketleftBigg π2 8−/parenleftBigg 1−(α/4) 1+/parenleftbig 8/π2/parenrightbig +(1/2α)/parenrightBigg/bracketrightBigg . Now minimize with respect to α, and show that the result is less than Ethreshold . Hint: Take full advantage of the symmetry of the problem—you only need to inte- grate over 1/8 of the open region, since the other seven integrals will be the same. Note however that whereas the trial wave function is continuous, its derivatives are not—there are “roof-lines” at the joins, and you will need to exploit the technique of Example 8.3.23 Problem 8.28 In Yukawa’s original theory (1934), which remains a useful approximation in nuclear physics, the “strong” force between protons and neutrons is mediated by the exchange of π-mesons. The potential energy is V(r)=−r0V0e−r/r0 r, (8.83) where ris the distance between the nucleons, and the range r0is related to the mass of the meson: r0=/planckover2pi1/mπc.Question: Does this theory account for the existence of thedeuteron (a bound state of the proton and the neutron)? The Schrödinger equation for the proton/neutron system is (see Problem 5.1): −/planckover2pi12 2μ∇2ψ(r)+V(r)ψ(r)=Eψ(r), (8.84) whereμis the reduced mass (the proton and neutron have almost identical masses, so call them both m), and ris the position of the neutron (say) relative to the proton: r=rn−rp. Your task is to show that there exists a solution with negative energy (a bound state), using a variational trial wave function of the form ψβ(r)=Ae−βr/r0. (8.85) 23W.-N.

(8.86) (c)Optimize your trial wave function, by setting dE(β)/dβ=0. This tells you βas a function ofγ(and hence—everything else being constant—of V0), but let’s use it instead to eliminate γin favor ofβ: Emin=/planckover2pi12 2μr2 0β2(1−2β) (3+2β). (8.87) (d)Setting /planckover2pi12/2μr2 0=1, plot Eminas a function of β,f o r0≤β≤1. What does this tell you about the binding of the deuteron? What is the minimum value of V0for which you can be conﬁdent there is a bound state (look up the necessary masses)? The experimental value is 52 MeV . Problem 8.29 Existence of Bound States. A potential “well” (in one dimension) is a function V(x)that is never positive (V(x)≤0 for all x), and goes to zero at inﬁnity (V(x)→0a sx→±∞).24 (a)Prove the following Theorem: If a potential well V1(x)supports at least one bound state, then any deeper/wider well (V2(x)≤V1(x)for all x)will also support at least one bound state. Hint: Use the ground state of V1,ψ1(x), as a variational test function. (b)Prove the following Corollary: Every potential well in one dimension has a bound state.25Hint: Use a ﬁnite square well (Section 2.6)f o r V1. (c)Does the Theorem generalize to two and three dimensions? How about the Corollary? Hint: You might want to review Problems 4.11 and4.51. ∗∗ Problem 8.30 Performing a variational calculation requires ﬁnding the minimum of the energy, as a function of the variational parameters. This is, in general, a very hard problem. However, if we choose the form of our trial wave function judiciously, we can develop an efﬁcient algorithm. In particular, suppose we use a linear combination of functionsφn(x): ψ(x)=N/summationdisplay n=1cnφn(x), (8.88) 24To exclude trivial cases, we also assume it has nonzero area/parenleftbig/integraltext V(x/parenrightbig dx/negationslash=0). Notice that for the purposes of this problem neither the inﬁnite square well nor the harmonic oscillator is a “potential well,” though both of them, of course, have bound states. 25K. R. Brownstein, Am. J. Phys. 68, 160 (2000) proves that any one-dimensional potential satisfying/integraltext∞ −∞V(x)dx≤0 admits a bound state (as long as V(x)is not identically zero)—even if it runs positive in some places.Further Problems on Chapter 8 353 where the cnare the variational parameters.

One could take derivatives with respect to the real and imaginary parts, ∂ ∂Re/bracketleftbig cj/bracketrightbigE=0a n d∂ ∂Im/bracketleftbig cj/bracketrightbigE=0, but it is also legitimate (and simpler) to treat cjandc∗ jas the independent parameters: ∂ ∂cjE=0a n d∂ ∂c∗ jE=0. You get the same result either way.9THE WKB APPROXIMATION The WKB (Wentzel, Kramers, Brillouin)1method is a technique for obtaining approximate solutions to the time-independent Schrödinger equation in one dimension (the same basic idea can be applied to many other differential equations, and to the radial part of the Schrödinger equation in three dimensions). It is particularly useful in calculating bound state energies and tunneling rates through potential barriers. The essential idea is as follows: Imagine a particle of energy Emoving through a region where the potential V(x)isconstant .I fE>V, the wave function is of the form ψ(x)=Ae±ikx,with k≡/radicalbig 2m(E−V)//planckover2pi1. The plus sign indicates that the particle is traveling to the right, and the minus sign means it is going to the left (the general solution, of course, is a linear combination of the two). The wave function is oscillatory, with ﬁxed wavelength (λ=2π/k)and unchanging amplitude (A). Now suppose that V(x)isnotconstant, but varies rather slowly in comparison to λ, so that over a region containing many full wavelengths the potential is essentially constant. Then it is reasonable to suppose that ψremains practically sinusoidal, except that the wavelength and the amplitude change slowly with x. This is the inspiration behind the WKB approximation. In effect, it identiﬁes two different levels of x-dependence: rapid oscillations, modulated by gradual variation in amplitude and wavelength. By the same token, if E<V(and Vis constant), then ψis exponential: ψ(x)=Ae±κx,withκ≡/radicalbig 2m(V−E)//planckover2pi1. And if V(x)isnotconstant, but varies slowly in comparison with 1 /κ, the solution remains practically exponential, except that Aandκare now slowly-varying functions of x. Now, there is one place where this whole program is bound to fail, and that is in the imme- diate vicinity of a classical turning point , where E≈V. For hereλ(or 1/κ)goes to inﬁnity, andV(x)can hardly be said to vary “slowly” in comparison. As we shall see, a proper handling of the turning points is the most difﬁcult aspect of the WKB approximation, though the ﬁnal results are simple to state and easy to implement. 9.1 THE “CLASSICAL” REGION The Schrödinger equation, −/planckover2pi12 2md2ψ dx2+V(x)ψ=Eψ, 1In Holland it’s KWB, in France it’s BWK, and in England it’s JWKB (for Jeffreys).9.1 The “Classical” Region 355 Classical regionTurning points xV(x) E Figure 9.1: Classically, the particle is conﬁned to the region where E≥V(x). can be rewritten in the following way: d2ψ dx2=−p2 /planckover2pi12ψ, (9.1) where p(x)≡/radicalbig 2m[E−V(x)] (9.2) is the classical formula for the (magnitude of the) momentum of a particle with total energy E and potential energy V(x). For the moment, I’ll assume that E>V(x), so that p(x)isreal; we call this the “classical” region, for obvious reasons—classically the particle is conﬁned to this range of x(see Figure 9.1). In general,ψis some complex function; we can express it in terms of its amplitude ,A(x), and its phase ,φ(x)—both of which are real: ψ(x)=A(x)eiφ(x). (9.3) Using a prime to denote the derivative with respect to x, dψ dx=/parenleftbig A/prime+iAφ/prime/parenrightbig eiφ, and d2ψ dx2=/bracketleftBig A/prime/prime+2iA/primeφ/prime+iAφ/prime/prime−A/parenleftbig φ/prime/parenrightbig2/bracketrightBig eiφ. (9.4) Putting this into Equation 9.1: A/prime/prime+2iA/primeφ/prime+iAφ/prime/prime−A/parenleftbig φ/prime/parenrightbig2=−p2 /planckover2pi12A. (9.5) This is equivalent to two realequations, one for the real part and one for the imaginary part: A/prime/prime−A/parenleftbig φ/prime/parenrightbig2=−p2 /planckover2pi12A,or A/prime/prime=A/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbig φ/prime/parenrightbig2−p2 /planckover2pi12/bracketrightbigg , (9.6) and 2A/primeφ/prime+Aφ/prime/prime=0,or/parenleftBig A2φ/prime/parenrightBig/prime =0. (9.7)356 CHAPTER 9 The WKB Approximation Equations 9.6and9.7are entirely equivalent to the original Schrödinger equation. The second one is easily solved: A2φ/prime=C2,or A=C√|φ/prime|, (9.8) where Cis a (real) constant. The ﬁrst one (Equation 9.6) cannot be solved in general—so here comes the approximation: We assume that the amplitude A varies slowly ,s ot h e A/prime/primeterm is negligible. (More precisely, we assume that A/prime/prime/Ais much less than both/parenleftbig φ/prime/parenrightbig2andp2//planckover2pi12.) In that case we can drop the left side of Equation 9.6, and we are left with /parenleftbig φ/prime/parenrightbig2=p2 /planckover2pi12,ordφ dx=±p /planckover2pi1, and therefore φ(x)=±1 /planckover2pi1/integraldisplay p(x)dx. (9.9) (I’ll write this as an indeﬁnite integral, for now—any constant of integration can be absorbed intoC, which thereby becomes complex. I’ll also absorb a factor of√ /planckover2pi1.) Then ψ(x)≈C√p(x)e±i /planckover2pi1/integraltext p(x)dx. (9.10) Notice that |ψ(x)|2≈|C|2 p(x), (9.11) which says that the probability of ﬁnding the particle at point xis inversely proportional to its (classical) momentum (and hence its velocity) at that point. This is exactly what you would expect—the particle doesn’t spend long in the places where it is moving rapidly, so the prob- ability of getting caught there is small. In fact, the WKB approximation is sometimes derived by starting with this “semi-classical” observation, instead of by dropping the A/prime/primeterm in the differential equation. The latter approach is cleaner mathematically, but the former offers a more illuminating physical rationale. The general (approximate) solution, of course, will be a linear combination the two solutions in Equation 9.10, one with each sign. Example 9.1 Potential well with two vertical walls. Suppose we have an inﬁnite square well with a bumpy bottom (Figure 9.2): V(x)=/braceleftBigg some speciﬁed function ,(0<x<a), ∞,( otherwise).(9.12) Inside the well (assuming E>V(x)throughout) we have ψ(x)≈1√p(x)/bracketleftBig C+eiφ(x)+C−e−iφ(x)/bracketrightBig , (9.13) or, more conveniently, ψ(x)≈1√p(x)[C1sinφ(x)+C2cosφ(x)], (9.14)9.1 The “Classical” Region 357 xV(x) a Figure 9.2: Inﬁnite square well with a bumpy bottom. where (exploiting the freedom noted earlier to impose a convenient lower limit on the integral)2 φ(x)=1 /planckover2pi1/integraldisplayx 0p/parenleftbig x/prime/parenrightbig dx/prime. (9.15) Now,ψ(x)must go to zero at x=0, and therefore (since φ(0)=0)C2=0. Also,ψ(x) goes to zero at x=a,s o φ(a)=nπ(n=1,2,3,...). (9.16) Conclusion: /integraldisplaya 0p(x)dx=nπ/planckover2pi1. (9.17) This quantization condition determines the (approximate) allowed energies. For instance, if the well has a ﬂatbottom(V(x)=0), then p(x)=√ 2mE (a constant), and Equation 9.17 says pa=nπ/planckover2pi1,o r En=n2π2/planckover2pi12 2ma2, which is the old formula for the energy levels of the inﬁnite square well (Equation 2.30). In this case the WKB approximation yields the exact answer (the amplitude of the true wave function is constant , so dropping A/prime/primecost us nothing). ∗ Problem 9.1 Use the WKB approximation to ﬁnd the allowed energies (En)of an inﬁnite square well with a “shelf,” of height V0, extending half-way across (Figure 7.3): V(x)=⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩V0,(0<x<a/2), 0,(a/2<x<a), ∞,(otherwise). 2We might as well take the positive sign, since both are covered by Equation 9.13.358 CHAPTER 9 The WKB Approximation Express your answer in terms of V0andE0 n≡(nπ/planckover2pi1)2/2ma2(the nth allowed energy for the inﬁnite square well with noshelf). Assume that E0 1>V0, but do notassume that En/greatermuchV0. Compare your result with what we got in Section 7.1.2 , using ﬁrst-order pertur- bation theory. Note that they are in agreement if either V0is very small (the perturbation theory regime) or nis very large (the WKB—semi-classical—regime). ∗∗ Problem 9.2 An alternative derivation of the WKB formula (Equation 9.10) is based on an expansion in powers of /planckover2pi1. Motivated by the free-particle wave function, ψ= Aexp(±ipx//planckover2pi1), we write ψ(x)=eif(x)//planckover2pi1, where f(x)is some complex function. (Note that there is no loss of generality here— any nonzero function can be written in this way.) (a)Put this into Schrödinger’s equation (in the form of Equation 9.1), and show that i/planckover2pi1f/prime/prime−/parenleftbig f/prime/parenrightbig2+p2=0. (b)Write f(x)as a power series in /planckover2pi1: f(x)=f0(x)+/planckover2pi1f1(x)+/planckover2pi12f2(x)+···, and, collecting like powers of /planckover2pi1, show that /parenleftbig f/prime 0/parenrightbig2=p2,if/prime/prime 0=2f/prime 0f/prime 1,if/prime/prime 1=2f/prime 0f/prime 2+/parenleftbig f/prime 1/parenrightbig2,etc. (c)Solve for f0(x)andf1(x), and show that—to ﬁrst order in /planckover2pi1—you recover Equation 9.10. Note: The logarithm of a negative number is deﬁned by ln (−z)=ln(z)+inπ, where nis an odd integer. If this formula is new to you, try exponentiating both sides, and you’ll see where it comes from. 9.2 TUNNELING So far, I have assumed that E>V,s op(x)is real. But we can easily write down the corre- sponding result in the non-classical region (E<V)—it’s the same as before (Equation 9.10), only now p(x)isimaginary :3 ψ(x)≈C√|p(x)|e±1 /planckover2pi1/integraltext|p(x)|dx. (9.18) Consider, for example, the problem of scattering from a rectangular barrier with a bumpy top (Figure 9.3). To the left of the barrier (x<0), ψ(x)=Aeikx+Be−ikx, (9.19) 3In this case the wave function is real, and the analogs to Equations 9.6and9.7do not follow necessarily from Equation 9.5, although they are still sufﬁcient . If this bothers you, study the alternative derivation in Problem 9.2.9.2 Tunneling 359 xEV(x) A B F a 0 Figure 9.3: Scattering from a rectangular barrier with a bumpy top. xA F 0 a Figure 9.4: Qualitative structure of the wave function, for scattering from a high, broad barrier. where Ais the incident amplitude, Bis the reﬂected amplitude, and k≡√ 2mE//planckover2pi1(see Section 2.5). To the right of the barrier (x>a), ψ(x)=Feikx, (9.20) where Fis the transmitted amplitude. The transmission probability is T=|F|2 |A|2. (9.21) In the tunneling region (0≤x≤a), the WKB approximation gives ψ(x)≈C√|p(x)|e1 /planckover2pi1/integraltextx 0|p(x/prime)|dx/prime+D√|p(x)|e−1 /planckover2pi1/integraltextx 0|p(x/prime)|dx/prime. (9.22) If the barrier is very high and/or very wide (which is to say, if the probability of tunneling is small), then the coefﬁcient of the exponentially increasing term(C)must be small (in fact, it would be zero if the barrier were inﬁnitely broad), and the wave function looks something like4Figure 9.4. The relative amplitudes of the incident and transmitted waves are determined essentially by the total decrease of the exponential over the nonclassical region: |F| |A|∼e−1 /planckover2pi1/integraltexta 0|p(x/prime)|dx/prime, so T≈e−2γ,withγ≡1 /planckover2pi1/integraldisplaya 0|p(x)|dx. (9.23) 4This heuristic argument can be made more rigorous—see Problem 9.11.360 CHAPTER 9 The WKB Approximation Example 9.2 Gamow’s theory of alpha decay.5In 1928, George Gamow (and, independently, Con- don and Gurney) used Equation 9.23 to provide the ﬁrst successful explanation of alpha decay (the spontaneous emission of an alpha particle—two protons and two neutrons—by certain radioactive nuclei).6Since the alpha particle carries a positive charge (2e), it will be electrically repelled by the leftover nucleus (charge Ze), as soon as it gets far enough away to escape the nuclear binding force. But ﬁrst it has to negotiate a potential barrier that was already known (in the case of uranium) to be more than twice the energy of the emitted alpha particle. Gamow approximated the potential energy by a ﬁnite square well (representing the attractive nuclear force), extending out to r1(the radius of the nucleus), joined to a repulsive Coulombic tail (Figure 9.5), and identiﬁed the escape mechanism as quantum tunneling (this was, by the way, the ﬁrst time that quantum mechanics had been applied to nuclear physics).

Merzbacher, “The Early History of Quantum Tunneling,” Physics Today , August 2002, p. 44. 7In this case the potential does not drop to zero on the left side of the barrier (moreover, this is really a three- dimensional problem), but the essential idea, contained in Equation 9.23, is all we really need.9.2 Tunneling 361 Typically, r1/lessmuchr2, and we can simplify this result using the small angle approximation (sin/epsilon1≈/epsilon1): γ∼=√ 2mE /planckover2pi1/bracketleftBigπ 2r2−2√r1r2/bracketrightBig =K1Z√ E−K2/radicalbig Zr1, (9.26) where K1≡/parenleftbigge2 4π/epsilon10/parenrightbiggπ√ 2m /planckover2pi1=1.980 MeV1/2, (9.27) and K2≡/parenleftbigge2 4π/epsilon10/parenrightbigg1/24√m /planckover2pi1=1.485 fm−1/2. (9.28) (One fermi (fm) is 10−15m, which is about the size of a typical nucleus.) If we imagine the alpha particle rattling around inside the nucleus, with an average velocityv, the time between “collisions” with the “wall” is about 2 r1/v, and hence the frequency of collisions is v/2r1. The probability of escape at each collision is e−2γ,s o the probability of emission, per unit time, is (v/2r1)e−2γ, and hence the lifetime of the parent nucleus is about τ=2r1 ve2γ. (9.29) Unfortunately, we don’t know v—but it hardly matters, for the exponential factor varies over a fantastic range (twenty-ﬁve orders of magnitude), as we go from one radioactive nucleus to another; relative to this the variation in vis pretty insigniﬁcant. In particular, if you plot the logarithm of the experimentally measured lifetime against 1 /√ E, the result is a beautiful straight line (Figure 9.6),8just as you would expect from Equations 9.26 and9.29.

Compare your answer with the exact result (Problem 2.33), to which it should reduce in the WKB regime T/lessmuch1. ∗∗ Problem 9.4 Calculate the lifetimes of U238and Po212, using Equations 9.26 and9.29. Hint: The density of nuclear matter is relatively constant (i.e. the same for all nuclei), so (r1)3is proportional to A(the number of neutrons plus protons). Empirically, r1∼=(1.07 fm)A1/3. (9.30) The energy of the emitted alpha particle can be deduced by using Einstein’s formula/parenleftbig E=mc2/parenrightbig : E=mpc2−mdc2−mαc2, (9.31) where mpis the mass of the parent nucleus, mdis the mass of the daughter nucleus, and mα is the mass of the alpha particle (which is to say, the He4nucleus). To ﬁgure out what the daughter nucleus is, note that the alpha particle carries off two protons and two neutrons, soZdecreases by 2 and Aby 4. Look up the relevant nuclear masses. To estimate v, useE=(1/2)mαv2; this ignores the (negative) potential energy inside the nucleus, and surely underestimates v, but it’s about the best we can do at this stage. Incidentally, the experimental lifetimes are 6 ×109yrs and 0.5µs, respectively. Problem 9.5 Zener Tunneling . In a semiconductor, an electric ﬁeld (if it’s large enough) can produce transitions between energy bands—a phenomenon known as Zener tunneling. A uniform electric ﬁeld E=− E0ˆı,f o rw h i c h H/prime=−eE0x, makes the energy bands position dependent, as shown in Figure 9.7. It is then possible for an electron to tunnel from the valence (lower) band to the conduction (upper) band; this phenomenon is the basis for the Zener diode . Treating the gap as a potential barrier through which the electron may tunnel, ﬁnd the tunneling probability in terms of Egand E0(as well as m,/planckover2pi1,e). 9.3 THE CONNECTION FORMULAS In the discussion so far I have assumed that the “walls” of the potential well (or the barrier) arevertical , so that the “exterior” solution is simple, and the boundary conditions trivial. As it turns out, our main results (Equations 9.17 and9.23) are reasonably accurate even when the edges are not so abrupt (indeed, in Gamow’s theory they were applied to just such a case). Nevertheless, it is of some interest to study more closely what happens to the wave function at a turning point (E=V), where the “classical” region joins the “nonclassical” region, and9.3 The Connection Formulas 363 (a)( b)Eg x x Figure 9.7: (a) The energy bands in the absence of an electric ﬁeld.

In this section I’ll treat the bound state problem (Figure 9.1); you get to do the scattering problem for yourself (Problem 9.11).9 For simplicity, let’s shift the axes over so that the right hand turning point occurs at x=0 (Figure 9.8). In the WKB approximation, we have ψ(x)≈⎧ ⎨ ⎩1√p(x)/bracketleftBig Bei /planckover2pi1/integraltext0 xp(x/prime)dx/prime+Ce−i /planckover2pi1/integraltext0 xp(x/prime)dx/prime/bracketrightBig ,x<0, 1√|p(x)|De−1 /planckover2pi1/integraltextx 0|p(x/prime)|dx/prime, x>0.(9.32) (Assuming V(x)remains greater than Eforall x>0, we can exclude the positive expo- nent in this region, because it blows up as x→∞ .) Our task is to join the two solutions at the boundary. But there is a serious difﬁculty here: In the WKB approximation, ψgoes to inﬁnity at the turning point (where p(x)→0).T h e true wave function, of course, has no such wild behavior—as anticipated, the WKB method simply fails in the vicinity of a turning point. And yet, it is precisely the boundary conditions at the turning points that determine the 9Warning: The following argument is quite technical, and you may wish to skip it on a ﬁrst reading.364 CHAPTER 9 The WKB Approximation allowed energies. What we need to do, then, is splice the two WKB solutions together, using a “patching” wave function that straddles the turning point. Since we only need the patching wave function/parenleftbig ψp/parenrightbig in the neighborhood of the origin, we’ll approximate the potential by a straight line : V(x)≈E+V/prime(0)x, (9.33) and solve the Schrödinger equation for this linearized V: −/planckover2pi12 2md2ψp dx2+(E+V/prime(0)x)ψp=Eψp, or d2ψp dx2=α3xψp, (9.34) where α≡/bracketleftbigg2m /planckover2pi12V/prime(0)/bracketrightbigg1/3 . (9.35) Theαs can be absorbed into the independent variable by deﬁning z≡αx, (9.36) so that d2ψp dz2=zψp. (9.37) This is Airy’s equation , and the solutions are called Airy functions .10Since the Airy equation is a second-order differential equation, there are two linearly independent Airy functions, Ai (z) and Bi(z). They are related to Bessel functions of order 1/3; some of their properties are listed in Table 9.1and they are plotted in Figure 9.9. Evidently the patching wave function is a linear combination of Ai (z)and Bi(z): ψp(x)=aAi(αx)+bBi(αx), (9.38) for appropriate constants aandb. Now,ψpis the (approximate) wave function in the neighborhood of the origin; our job is to match it to the WKB solutions in the overlap regions on either side (see Figure 9.10). These overlap zones are close enough to the turning point that the linearized potential is reasonably accurate (so that ψpis a good approximation to the true wave function), and yet far enough away from the turning point that the WKB approximation is reliable.11In the overlap regions Equation 9.33 holds, and therefore (in the notation of Equation 9.35) p(x)≈/radicalbig 2m(E−E−V/prime(0)x)=/planckover2pi1α3/2√ −x. (9.39) 10Classically , a linear potential means a constant force, and hence a constant acceleration—the simplest nontrivial motion possible, and the starting point for elementary mechanics. It is ironic that the same potential in quantum mechanics yields stationary states that are unfamiliar transcendental functions, and plays only a peripheral role in the theory. Still, wave packets can be reasonably simple—see Problem 2.51 and especially footnote 61,p a g e 81. 11This is a delicate double constraint, and it is possible to concoct potentials so pathological that no such overlap region exists. However, in practical applications this seldom occurs. See Problem 9.9.9.3 The Connection Formulas 365 Table 9.1: Some properties of the Airy functions. Differential Equation :d2y dz2=zy.

Meanwhile, using the large- zasymptotic forms12of the Airy functions (from Table 9.1), the patching wave function (Equation 9.38) in overlap region 2 becomes ψp(x)≈a 2√π(αx)1/4e−2 3(αx)3/2+b√π(αx)1/4e2 3(αx)3/2.

(9.45) 12At ﬁrst glance it seems absurd to use a large -zapproximation in this region, which after all is supposed to be reasonably close to the turning point at z=0 (so that the linear approximation to the potential is valid). But notice that the argument here is αx, and if you study the matter carefully (see Problem 9.9) you will ﬁnd that there is (typically) a region in which αxis large, but at the same time it is reasonable to approximate V(x)by a straight line. Indeed, the asymptotic forms of the Airy functions areprecisely the WKB solutions to Airy’s equation, and since we are already using ψWKB in the overlap region (Figure 9.10) it is not really a newapproximation to do the same forψp.9.3 The Connection Formulas 367 Comparing the WKB and patching wave functions in overlap region 1, we ﬁnd a 2i√πeiπ/4=B√ /planckover2pi1αand−a 2i√πe−iπ/4=C√ /planckover2pi1α, or, putting in Equation 9.42 fora: B=−ieiπ/4D,and C=ie−iπ/4D. (9.46) These are the so-called connection formulas , joining the WKB solutions at either side of the turning point. We’re done with the patching wave function now—its only purpose was to bridge the gap. Expressing everything in terms of the one normalization constant D, and shifting the turning point back from the origin to an arbitrary point x2, the WKB wave function (Equation 9.32) becomes ψ(x)≈⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩2D√p(x)sin/bracketleftBig 1 /planckover2pi1/integraltextx2 xp/parenleftbig x/prime/parenrightbig dx/prime+π 4/bracketrightBig ,x<x2; D√|p(x)|exp/bracketleftBig −1 /planckover2pi1/integraltextx x2/vextendsingle/vextendsinglep/parenleftbig x/prime/parenrightbig/vextendsingle/vextendsingledx/prime/bracketrightBig ,x>x2.(9.47) Example 9.3 Potential well with one vertical wall.

(9.50) In this particular case the WKB approximation actually delivers the exact allowed energies (which are precisely the oddenergies of the fullharmonic oscillator—see Problem 2.41). Example 9.4 Potential well with no vertical walls. Equation 9.47 connects the WKB wave functions at a turning point where the potential slopes upward (Figure 9.12(a)); the same reasoning, applied to a downward -sloping turning point (Figure 9.12(b)), yields (Problem 9.10) ψ(x)≈⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩D/prime√|p(x)|exp/bracketleftBig −1 /planckover2pi1/integraltextx1 x/vextendsingle/vextendsinglep/parenleftbig x/prime/parenrightbig/vextendsingle/vextendsingledx/prime/bracketrightBig ,x<x1; 2D/prime√p(x)sin/bracketleftBig 1 /planckover2pi1/integraltextx x1p/parenleftbig x/prime/parenrightbig dx/prime+π 4/bracketrightBig ,x>x1.(9.51) V(x) xx2E (a)x1E (b)x1E x2 (c) Figure 9.12: Upward-sloping and downward-sloping turning points. In particular, if we’re talking about a potential well (Figure 9.12(c)), the wave function in the “interior” region (x1<x<x2)can be written either as ψ(x)≈2D√p(x)sinθ2(x),whereθ2(x)≡1 /planckover2pi1/integraldisplayx2 xp/parenleftbig x/prime/parenrightbig dx/prime+π 4,9.3 The Connection Formulas 369 (Equation 9.47),oras ψ(x)≈−2D/prime √p(x)sinθ1(x),whereθ1(x)≡−1 /planckover2pi1/integraldisplayx x1p/parenleftbig x/prime/parenrightbig dx/prime−π 4, (Equation 9.51). Evidently the arguments of the sine functions must be equal, modulo π:13 θ2=θ1+nπ, from which it follows that /integraldisplayx2 x1p(x)dx=/parenleftbigg n−1 2/parenrightbigg π/planckover2pi1,with n=1,2,3,.... (9.52) This quantization condition determines the allowed energies for the “typical” case of a potential well with two sloping sides. Notice that it differs from the formulas for two ver- tical walls (Equation 9.17) or one vertical wall (Equation 9.48) only in the number that is subtracted from n(0, 1/4, or 1/2). Since the WKB approximation works best in the semi- classical (large n)regime, the distinction is more in appearance than in substance. In any event, the result is extraordinarily powerful, for it enables us to calculate (approximate) allowed energies without ever solving the Schrödinger equation , by simply evaluating one integral. The wave function itself has dropped out of sight. ∗∗ Problem 9.6 The “bouncing ball” revisited.

In the former case ψ/prime(0)=0, and in the latter case ψ(0)=0.

(c)We are particularly interested in a high and/or broad central barrier, in which case φis large, and eφishuge . Equation 9.60 then tells us that θmust be very close to a half-integer multiple of π. With this in mind, write θ=(n+1/2)π+/epsilon1, where |/epsilon1|/lessmuch1, and show that the quantization condition becomes θ≈/parenleftbigg n+1 2/parenrightbigg π∓1 2e−φ.

(9.64) Comment: If the central barrier were impenetrable(φ→∞), we would simply have two detached harmonic oscillators, and the energies, En=(n+1/2)/planckover2pi1ω, would be doubly degenerate, since the particle could be in the left well or in the right one. When the barrier becomes ﬁnite (putting the two wells into “communi- cation”), the degeneracy is lifted.

Show that it oscillates back and forth between the wells, with a period τ=2π2 ωeφ.

Crandall, Scientiﬁc American , February, 1997, p. 74.Further Problems on Chapter 9 375 Problem 9.20 Equation 9.23 tells us the (approximate) transmission probability for tun- neling through a barrier, when E<Vmax—a classically forbidden process. In this problem we explore the complementary phenomenon: reﬂection from a barrier when E>Vmax(again, a classically forbidden process). We’ll assume that V(x)is an even analytic function, that goes to zero as x→±∞ (Figure 9.15).Question: What is the analog to Equation 9.23? (a)Try the obvious approach: assume the potential vanishes for |x|≥a, and use the WKB approximation (Equation 9.13) in the scattering region: ψ(x)⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩=Aeikx+Be−ikx, x<a, ≈1√p(x)/bracketleftbig C+eiφ(x)+C−e−iφ(x)/bracketrightbig ,−a<x<a, =Ceikx, x>a.(9.66) Impose the usual boundary conditions at ±a, and solve for the reﬂection probabil- ity,R=|B|2/|A|2. Unfortunately, the result (R=0)is uninformative. It’s true that the Ris expo- nentially small (just as the transmission coefﬁcient is, for E<Vmax),b u tw e ’ v e thrown the baby out with the bath water—this approximation is simply too drastic. The correct formula is R=e−2λ,whereλ≡2 /planckover2pi1/integraldisplayy0 0p(iy)dy (9.67) andy0is deﬁned by p(iy0)=0. Notice thatλ(likeγin Equation 9.23) goes like 1//planckover2pi1; it is in fact the leading term in an expansion in powers of /planckover2pi1:λ=c1//planckover2pi1+c2+ c3/planckover2pi1+c4/planckover2pi12+··· . In the classical limit (/planckover2pi1→0),λandγgo to inﬁnity, so Rand Tgo to zero, as expected. It is not easy to derive Equation 9.67,20but let’s look at some examples.

It comes in with energy Eandimpact parameter b, and it emerges at some scattering angle θ—see Figure 10.1. (I’ll assume for simplicity that the target is symmetrical about the zaxis, so the trajectory remains in one plane, and that the target is very heavy, so its recoil is negligible.) The essential problem of classical scattering theory is this: Given the impact parameter, calculate the scattering angle . Ordinarily, of course, the smaller the impact parameter, the greater the scattering angle. bθ Scattering center z Figure 10.1: The classical scattering problem, showing the impact parameter band the scattering angle θ. Example 10.1 Hard-sphere scattering. Suppose the target is a billiard ball, of radius R, and the incident particle is a BB, which bounces off elastically (Figure 10.2). In terms of the angle α,t h e impact parameter is b=Rsinα, and the scattering angle is θ=π−2α,s o b=Rsin/parenleftbiggπ 2−θ 2/parenrightbigg =Rcos/parenleftbiggθ 2/parenrightbigg . (10.1) Evidently θ=/braceleftBigg 2 cos−1(b/R),(b≤R), 0,( b≥R).(10.2)10.1 Introduction 377 bαα αR zθ Figure 10.2: Elastic hard-sphere scattering. bdσ φ dΩ θ dθ Figure 10.3: Particles incident in the area dσscatter into the solid angle d/Omega1. More generally, particles incident within an inﬁnitesimal patch of cross-sectional area dσ will scatter into a corresponding inﬁnitesimal solid angle d/Omega1(Figure 10.3). The larger dσis, the bigger d/Omega1will be; the proportionality factor, D(θ)≡dσ/d/Omega1, is called the differential (scattering) cross-section :1 dσ=D(θ)d/Omega1. (10.3) 1This is terrible language: Disn’t a differential , and it isn’t a cross-section. To my ear, the words “differential cross- section” would attach more naturally to dσ. But I’m afraid we’re stuck with this terminology. I should also warn you that the notation D(θ)is nonstandard—most people just call it dσ/d/Omega1(which makes Equation 10.3 look like a tautology). I think it will be less confusing if we give the differential cross-section its own symbol.378 CHAPTER 10 Scattering In terms of the impact parameter and the azimuthal angle φ,dσ=bdbdφandd/Omega1= sinθdθdφ,s o D(θ)=b sinθ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingledb dθ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle. (10.4) (Sinceθis typically a decreasing function of b, the derivative is actually negative—hence the absolute value sign.) Example 10.2 Hard-sphere scattering (continued). In the case of hard-sphere scattering (Example 10.1) db dθ=−1 2Rsin/parenleftbiggθ 2/parenrightbigg , (10.5) so D(θ)=Rcos(θ/2) sinθ/parenleftbiggRsin(θ/2) 2/parenrightbigg =R2 (10.6) This example is unusual, in that the differential cross-section is independent of θ. Thetotal cross-section is the integral ofD(θ), over all solid angles: σ≡/integraldisplay D(θ)d/Omega1; (10.7) roughly speaking, it is the total area of incident beam that is scattered by the target. For example, in the case of hard-sphere scattering, σ=/parenleftBig R2/4/parenrightBig/integraldisplay d/Omega1=πR2, (10.8) which is just what we would expect: It’s the cross-sectional area of the sphere; BB’s incident within this area will hit the target, and those farther out will miss it completely. But the virtue of the formalism developed here is that it applies just as well to “soft” targets (such as the Coulomb ﬁeld of a nucleus) that are notsimply “hit-or-miss”. Finally, suppose we have a beam of incident particles, with uniform intensity (or luminosity , as particle physicists call it) L≡number of incident particles per unit area, per unit time. (10.9) The number of particles entering area dσ(and hence scattering into solid angle d/Omega1), per unit time, is dN=Ldσ=LD(θ)d/Omega1,s o D(θ)=1 LdN d/Omega1. (10.10) This is sometimes taken as the deﬁnition of the differential cross-section, because it makes reference only to quantities easily measured in the laboratory: If the detector subtends a solid angle d/Omega1, we simply count the number recorded per unit time (the event rate ,dN), divide by d/Omega1, and normalize to the luminosity of the incident beam.10.1 Introduction 379 ∗∗∗ Problem 10.1 Rutherford scattering.

(10.11) (c)Show that the total cross-section for Rutherford scattering is inﬁnite . 10.1.2 Quantum Scattering Theory In the quantum theory of scattering, we imagine an incident plane wave, ψ(z)=Aeikz,t r a v e l - ing in the zdirection, which encounters a scattering potential, producing an outgoing spherical wave (Figure 10.4).3That is, we look for solutions to the Schrödinger equation of the generic form ψ(r,θ)≈A/braceleftbigg eikz+f(θ)eikr r/bracerightbigg ,for large r. (10.12) (The spherical wave carries a factor of 1 /r, because this portion of |ψ|2must go like 1/r2to conserve probability.) The wave number kis related to the energy of the incident particles in the usual way: eikzeikr zθ Figure 10.4: Scattering of waves; an incoming plane wave generates an outgoing spherical wave. 2This isn’t easy, and you might want to refer to a book on classical mechanics, such as Jerry B. Marion and Stephen T. Thornton, Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems , 4th edn, Saunders, Fort Worth, TX (1995), Section 9.10. 3For the moment, there’s not much quantum mechanics in this; what we’re really talking about is the scattering of waves , as opposed to particles , and you could even think of Figure 10.4 as a picture of water waves encountering a rock, or (better, since we’re interested in three-dimensional scattering) sound waves bouncing off a basketball.380 CHAPTER 10 Scattering υ υ dtdσ Figure 10.5: The volume dVof incident beam that passes through area dσin time dt. k≡√ 2mE /planckover2pi1. (10.13) (As before, I assume the target is azimuthally symmetrical; in the more general case fwould depend onφas well asθ.) The whole problem is to determine the scattering amplitude f(θ); it tells you the proba- bility of scattering in a given direction θ, and hence is related to the differential cross-section. Indeed, the probability that the incident particle, traveling at speed v, passes through the inﬁnitesimal area dσ, in time dt, is (see Figure 10.5) dP=|ψincident|2dV=|A|2(vdt)dσ. But this is equal to the probability that the particle scatters into the corresponding solid angle d/Omega1: dP=|ψscattered|2dV=|A|2|f|2 r2(vdt)r2d/Omega1, from which it follows that dσ=|f|2d/Omega1, and hence D(θ)=dσ d/Omega1=|f(θ)|2. (10.14) Evidently the differential cross-section (which is the quantity of interest to the experimentalist) is equal to the absolute square of the scattering amplitude (which is obtained by solving the Schrödinger equation). In the following sections we will study two techniques for calculating the scattering amplitude: partial wave analysis and the Born approximation . Problem 10.2 Construct the analogs to Equation 10.12 for one-dimensional and two- dimensional scattering. 10.2 PARTIAL WAVE ANALYSIS 10.2.1 Formalism As we found in Chapter 4, the Schrödinger equation for a spherically symmetrical potential V(r)admits the separable solutions ψ(r,θ,φ)=R(r)Ym /lscript(θ,φ), (10.15) where Ym /lscriptis a spherical harmonic (Equation 4.32), and u(r)=rR(r)satisﬁes the radial equation (Equation 4.37): −/planckover2pi12 2md2u dr2+/bracketleftbigg V(r)+/planckover2pi12 2m/lscript(/lscript+1) r2/bracketrightbigg u=Eu. (10.16)10.2 Partial Wave Analysis 381 Scattering regionIntermediate region V≅0 Radiation zone (kr >> 1) V≠0 Figure 10.6: Scattering from a localized potential: the scattering region (dark), the intermediate region, where V=0 (shaded), and the radiation zone (where kr/greatermuch1). Atvery large rthe potential goes to zero, and the centrifugal contribution is negligible, so d2u dr2≈−k2u. The general solution is u(r)=Ceikr+De−ikr; the ﬁrst term represents an outgoing spherical wave, and the second an incoming one—for the scattered wave we want D=0. At very large r, then, R(r)∼eikr r, as we already deduced (on physical grounds) in the previous section (Equation 10.12 ). That’s for very large r(more precisely, for kr/greatermuch1; in optics it would be called the radiation zone ). As in one-dimensional scattering theory, we assume that the potential is “localized,” in the sense that exterior to some ﬁnite scattering region it is essentially zero (Figure 10.6). In the intermediate region (where Vcan be ignored but the centrifugal term cannot),4the radial equation becomes d2u dr2−/lscript(/lscript+1) r2u=−k2u, (10.17) and the general solution (Equation 4.45) is a linear combination of spherical Bessel functions: u(r)=Ar j/lscript(kr)+Brn/lscript(kr). (10.18) However, neither j/lscript(which is somewhat like a sine function) nor n/lscript(which is a sort of gen- eralized cosine function) represents an outgoing (or an incoming) wave. What we need are the linear combinations analogous to eikrande−ikr; these are known as spherical Hankel functions : h(1) /lscript(x)≡j/lscript(x)+in/lscript(x);h(2) /lscript(x)≡j/lscript(x)−in/lscript(x). (10.19) 4What follows does not apply to the Coulomb potential, since 1 /rgoes to zero more slowly than 1 /r2,a sr→∞ , and the centrifugal term does notdominate in this region. In this sense the Coulomb potential is not localized, and partial wave analysis is inapplicable.382 CHAPTER 10 Scattering Table 10.1: Spherical Hankel functions, h(1) /lscript(x)and h(2) /lscript(x). The ﬁrst few spherical Hankel functions are listed in Table 10.1. At large r,h(1) /lscript(kr)(theHan- kel function of the ﬁrst kind ) goes like eikr/r, whereas h(2) /lscript(kr)(theHankel function of the second kind ) goes like e−ikr/r; for outgoing waves, then, we need spherical Hankel functions of the ﬁrst kind: R(r)∼h(1) /lscript(kr). (10.20) The exact wave function, in the exterior region (where V(r)=0), is ψ(r,θ,φ)=A⎧ ⎨ ⎩eikz+/summationdisplay /lscript,mC/lscript,mh(1) /lscript(kr)Ym /lscript(θ,φ)⎫ ⎬ ⎭. (10.21) The ﬁrst term is the incident plane wave, and the sum (with expansion coefﬁcients C/lscript,m)i s the scattered wave. But since we are assuming the potential is spherically symmetric, the wave function cannot depend on φ.5So only terms with m=0 survive (remember, Ym /lscript∼eimφ). Now (from Equations 4.27 and4.32) Y0 /lscript(θ,φ)=/radicalbigg 2/lscript+1 4πP/lscript(cosθ), (10.22) where P/lscriptis the/lscriptth Legendre polynomial. It is customary to redeﬁne the expansion coefﬁcients/parenleftbig C/lscript,0≡i/lscript+1k√4π(2/lscript+1)a/lscript/parenrightbig : ψ(r,θ)=A/braceleftBigg eikz+k∞/summationdisplay /lscript=0i/lscript+1(2/lscript+1)a/lscripth(1) /lscript(kr)P/lscript(cosθ)/bracerightBigg . (10.23) You’ll see in a moment why this peculiar notation is convenient; a/lscriptis called the/lscriptthpartial wave amplitude . Forvery large r , the Hankel function goes like (−i)/lscript+1eikr/kr(Table 10.1), so ψ(r,θ)≈A/braceleftbigg eikz+f(θ)eikr r/bracerightbigg , (10.24) 5There’s nothing wrong with θdependence, of course, because the incoming plane wave deﬁnes a zdirection, break- ing the spherical symmetry. But the azimuthal symmetry remains; the incident plane wave has no φdependence, and there is nothing in the scattering process that could introduce any φdependence in the outgoing wave.10.2 Partial Wave Analysis 383 where f(θ)=∞/summationdisplay /lscript=0(2/lscript+1)a/lscriptP/lscript(cosθ). (10.25) This conﬁrms more rigorously the general structure postulated in Equation 10.12 , and tells us how to compute the scattering amplitude, f(θ), in terms of the partial wave amplitudes (a/lscript). The differential cross-section is D(θ)=|f(θ)|2=/summationdisplay /lscript/summationdisplay /lscript/prime(2/lscript+1)/parenleftbig 2/lscript/prime+1/parenrightbig a∗ /lscripta/lscript/primeP/lscript(cosθ)P/lscript/prime(cosθ), (10.26) and the total cross-section is σ=4π∞/summationdisplay /lscript=0(2/lscript+1)|a/lscript|2. (10.27) (I used the orthogonality of the Legendre polynomials, Equation 4.34, to do the angular integration.) 10.2.2 Strategy All that remains is to determine the partial wave amplitudes, a/lscript, for the potential in question. This is accomplished by solving the Schrödinger equation in the interior region (where V(r) isnotzero), and matching it to the exterior solution (Equation 10.23 ), using the appropriate boundary conditions. The only problem is that as it stands my notation is hybrid: I used spher- icalcoordinates for the scattered wave, but cartesian coordinates for the incident wave. We need to rewrite the wave function in a more consistent notation. Of course, eikzsatisﬁes the Schrödinger equation with V=0. On the other hand, I just argued that the general solution to the Schrödinger equation with V=0 can be written in the form /summationdisplay /lscript,m/bracketleftbig A/lscript,mj/lscript(kr)+B/lscript,mn/lscript(kr)/bracketrightbig Ym /lscript(θ,φ). In particular, then, it must be possible to express eikzin this way. But eikzis ﬁnite at the origin, so no Neumann functions are allowed in the sum (n/lscript(kr)blows up at r=0), and since z=rcosθhas noφdependence, only m=0 terms occur. The resulting expansion of a plane wave in terms of spherical waves is known as Rayleigh’s formula :6 eikz=∞/summationdisplay /lscript=0i/lscript(2/lscript+1)j/lscript(kr)P/lscript(cosθ). (10.28) Using this, the wave function in the exterior region (Equation 10.23 ) can be expressed entirely in terms of randθ: ψ(r,θ)=A∞/summationdisplay /lscript=0i/lscript(2/lscript+1)/bracketleftBig j/lscript(kr)+ik a/lscripth(1) /lscript(kr)/bracketrightBig P/lscript(cosθ).

(10.34) That’s the exact answer, but it’s not terribly illuminating, so let’s consider the limiting case of low-energy scattering :ka/lessmuch1. (Since k=2π/λ, this amounts to saying that the wavelength is much greater than the radius of the sphere.) Referring to Table 4.4, we note thatn/lscript(z)is much larger than j/lscript(z), for small z,s o j/lscript(z) h(1) /lscript(z)=j/lscript(z) j/lscript(z)+in/lscript(z)≈−ij/lscript(z) n/lscript(z) ≈−i2/lscript/lscript!z/lscript/(2/lscript+1)! −(2/lscript)!z−/lscript−1/2/lscript/lscript!=i 2/lscript+1/bracketleftbigg2/lscript/lscript!

But we’re assuming ka/lessmuch1, so the higher powers are negligible—in the low-energy approximation the scattering is dominated by the /lscript=0 term. (This means that the differential cross-section is independent of θ, just as it was in the classical case.) Evidently σ≈4πa2, (10.36) for low energy hard-sphere scattering. Surprisingly, the scattering cross-section is four times the geometrical cross-section—in fact, σis the total surface area of the sphere .T h i s “larger effective size” is characteristic of long-wavelength scattering (it would be true in optics, as well); in a sense, these waves “feel” their way around the whole sphere, whereas classical particles only see the head-on cross-section (Equation 10.8).10.3 Phase Shifts 385 Problem 10.3 Prove Equation 10.33 , starting with Equation 10.32 .Hint: Exploit the orthog- onality of the Legendre polynomials to show that the coefﬁcients with different values of /lscriptmust separately vanish. ∗∗ Problem 10.4 Consider the case of low-energy scattering from a spherical delta-function shell: V(r)=αδ(r−a), whereαandaare constants.

I’ll put a “brick wall” at x=0, so a wave incident from the left, ψi(x)=Aeikx(x<−a) (10.37) is entirely reﬂected ψr(x)=Be−ikx(x<−a). (10.38) Whatever happens in the interaction region (−a<x<0), the amplitude of the reﬂected wave hasgotto be the same as that of the incident wave (|B|=|A|), by conservation of probability. But it need not have the same phase . If there were no potential at all (just the wall at x=0), then B=− A, since the total wave function (incident plus reﬂected) must vanish at the origin: ψ(x)=A/parenleftBig eikx−e−ikx/parenrightBig (V(x)=0). (10.39) –a xV Be–ikx Aeikx Figure 10.7: One-dimensional scattering from a localized potential bounded on the right by an inﬁnite wall.386 CHAPTER 10 Scattering If the potential is notzero, the wave function (for x<−a) takes the form ψ(x)=A/parenleftBig eikx−ei(2δ−kx)/parenrightBig (V(x)/negationslash=0). (10.40) The whole theory of scattering reduces to the problem of calculating the phase shift7δ(as af u n c t i o no f k, and hence of the energy E=/planckover2pi12k2/2m), for a speciﬁed potential. We do this, of course, by solving the Schrödinger equation in the scattering region (−a<x<0), and imposing appropriate boundary conditions (see Problem 10.5). The advantage of working with the phase shift (as opposed to the complex number B) is that it exploits the physics to simplify the mathematics (trading a complex quantity—two real numbers—for a single real quantity). Now let’s return to the three-dimensional case. The incident plane wave/parenleftbig Aeikz/parenrightbig carries no angular momentum in the zdirection (Rayleigh’s formula contains no terms with m/negationslash=0), but it includes all values of the total angular momentum (/lscript=0,1,2,...). Because angular momentum is conserved (by a spherically symmetric potential), each partial wave (labelled by a particular/lscript) scatters independently, with (again) no change in amplitude8—only in phase. If there is no potential at all, then ψ=Aeikz, and the/lscriptth partial wave is (Equation 10.28 ) ψ(/lscript)=Ai/lscript(2/lscript+1)j/lscript(kr)P/lscript(cosθ)(V(r)=0). (10.41) But (from Equation 10.19 and Table 10.1) j/lscript(x)=1 2/bracketleftBig h(1) /lscript(x)+h(2) /lscript(x)/bracketrightBig ≈1 2x/bracketleftBig (−i)/lscript+1eix+i/lscript+1e−ix/bracketrightBig (x/greatermuch1). (10.42) So for large r ψ(/lscript)≈A(2/lscript+1) 2ikr/bracketleftBig eikr−(−1)/lscripte−ikr/bracketrightBig P/lscript(cosθ)( V(r)=0). (10.43) The second term inside the square brackets represents an incoming spherical wave; it comes from the incident plane wave, and is unchanged when we now introduce a potential. The ﬁrst term is the outgoing wave; it picks up a phase shift (due to the scattering potential): ψ(/lscript)≈A(2/lscript+1) 2ikr/bracketleftBig ei(kr+2δ/lscript)−(−1)/lscripte−ikr/bracketrightBig P/lscript(cosθ)( V(r)/negationslash=0). (10.44) Think of it as a converging spherical wave (the e−ikrterm, due exclusively to the h(2) /lscriptcompo- nent in eikz), which is phase shifted an amount δ/lscripton the way in, and again δ/lscripton the way out (hence the 2), emerging as an outgoing spherical wave (the eikrterm, due to the h(1) /lscriptpart of eikzplus the scattered wave). In Section 10.2.1 the whole theory was expressed in terms of the partial wave amplitudes a/lscript; now we have formulated it in terms of the phase shifts δ/lscript. There must be a connection between the two. Indeed, comparing the asymptotic (large r) form of Equation 10.23 ψ(/lscript)≈A/braceleftbigg(2/lscript+1) 2ikr/bracketleftBig eikr−(−1)/lscripte−ikr/bracketrightBig +(2/lscript+1) ra/lscripteikr/bracerightbigg P/lscript(cosθ) (10.45) 7The 2 in front of δis conventional. We think of the incident wave as being phase shifted once on the way in, and again on the way out; δis the “one way” phase shift, and the total is 2δ. 8One reason this subject can be so confusing is that practically everything is called an “amplitude”: f(θ)is the “scattering amplitude”, a/lscriptis the “partial wave amplitude”, but the ﬁrst is a function of θ, and both are complex numbers. I’m nowtalking about “amplitude” in the original sense: the ( real, of course) height of a sinusoidal wave.10.3 Phase Shifts 387 with the generic expression in terms of δ/lscript(Equation 10.44 ), we ﬁnd9 a/lscript=1 2ik/parenleftBig e2iδ/lscript−1/parenrightBig =1 keiδ/lscriptsin(δ/lscript). (10.46) It follows in particular (Equation 10.25 ) that f(θ)=1 k∞/summationdisplay /lscript=0(2/lscript+1)eiδ/lscriptsin(δ/lscript)P/lscript(cosθ) (10.47) and (Equation 10.27 ) σ=4π k2∞/summationdisplay /lscript=0(2/lscript+1)sin2(δ/lscript). (10.48) Again, the advantage of working with phase shifts (as opposed to partial wave amplitudes) is that they are easier to interpret physically, and simpler mathematically—the phase shift formalism exploits conservation of angular momentum to reduce a complex quantity a/lscript(two real numbers) to a single real one δ/lscript.

Both of them are constants (independent of r), andδ/lscriptmeans the phase shift in the asymptotic region (where the Hankel functions have settled down to e±ikr/kr).388 CHAPTER 10 Scattering 10.4 THE BORN APPROXIMATION 10.4.1 Integral Form of the Schrödinger Equation The time-independent Schrödinger equation, −/planckover2pi12 2m∇2ψ+Vψ=Eψ, (10.49) can be written more succinctly as /parenleftBig ∇2+k2/parenrightBig ψ=Q, (10.50) where k≡√ 2mE /planckover2pi1and Q≡2m /planckover2pi12Vψ. (10.51) This has the superﬁcial appearance of the Helmholtz equation ; note, however, that the “inho- mogeneous” term (Q)itself depends onψ. Suppose we could ﬁnd a function G(r)that solves the Helmholtz equation with a delta function “source”: /parenleftBig ∇2+k2/parenrightBig G(r)=δ3(r). (10.52) Then we could express ψas an integral: ψ(r)=/integraldisplay G(r–r 0)Q(r0)d3r0. (10.53) For it is easy to show that this satisﬁes Schrödinger’s equation, in the form of Equation 10.50 : /parenleftBig ∇2+k2/parenrightBig ψ(r)=/integraldisplay/bracketleftBig/parenleftBig ∇2+k2/parenrightBig G(r–r 0)/bracketrightBig Q(r0)d3r0 =/integraldisplay δ3(r–r 0)Q(r0)d3r0=Q(r). G(r)is called the Green’s function for the Helmholtz equation. (In general, the Green’s function for a linear differential equation represents the “response” to a delta-function source.) Our ﬁrst task10is to solve Equation 10.52 forG(r). This is most easily accomplished by taking the Fourier transform, which turns the differential equation into an algebraic equation. Let G(r)=1 (2π)3/2/integraldisplay eis·rg(s)d3s. (10.54) Then/parenleftBig ∇2+k2/parenrightBig G(r)=1 (2π)3/2/integraldisplay/bracketleftBig/parenleftBig ∇2+k2/parenrightBig eis·r/bracketrightBig g(s)d3s. But ∇2eis·r=−s2eis·r, (10.55) and (see Equation 2.147 ) δ3(r)=1 (2π)3/integraldisplay eis·rd3s, (10.56) 10Warning: You are approaching two pages of heavy analysis, including contour integration; if you wish, skip straight to the answer, Equation 10.65 .10.4 The Born Approximation 389 s r θ φ Figure 10.8: Convenient coordinates for the integral in Equation 10.58 . so Equation 10.52 says 1 (2π)3/2/integraldisplay/parenleftBig −s2+k2/parenrightBig eis·rg(s)d3s=1 (2π)3/integraldisplay eis·rd3s. It follows11that g(s)=1 (2π)3/2/parenleftbig k2−s2/parenrightbig. (10.57) Putting this back into Equation 10.54 , we ﬁnd: G(r)=1 (2π)3/integraldisplay eis·r 1/parenleftbig k2−s2/parenrightbigd3s. (10.58) Now, risﬁxed, as far as the sintegration is concerned, so we may as well choose spherical coordinates(s,θ,φ)with the polar axis along r(Figure 10.8). Then s·r=srcosθ,t h eφ integral is trivial (2π), and theθintegral is /integraldisplayπ 0eisrcosθsinθdθ=−eisrcosθ isr/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleπ 0=2s i n(sr) sr. (10.59) Thus G(r)=1 (2π)22 r/integraldisplay∞ 0ssin(sr) k2−s2ds=1 4π2r/integraldisplay∞ −∞ssin(sr) k2−s2ds. (10.60) The remaining integral is not so simple. It pays to revert to exponential notation, and factor the denominator: G(r)=i 8π2r/braceleftbigg/integraldisplay∞ −∞seisr (s−k)(s+k)ds−/integraldisplay∞ −∞se−isr (s−k)(s+k)ds/bracerightbigg =i 8π2r(I1−I2). (10.61) These two integrals can be evaluated using Cauchy’s integral formula : /contintegraldisplayf(z) (z−z0)dz=2πif(z0), (10.62) 11This is clearly sufﬁcient , but it is also necessary , as you can easily show by combining the two terms into a single integral, and using Plancherel’s theorem, Equation 2.103 .390 CHAPTER 10 Scattering Im(s) Re(s) s = +k s = −k Figure 10.9: Skirting the poles in the contour integral (Equation 10.61 ). (a) (b) Figure 10.10: Closing the contour in Equations 10.63 and10.64 . ifz0lies within the contour (otherwise the integral is zero). In the present case the integration is along the real axis, and it passes right over the pole singularities at ±k. We have to decide how to skirt the poles—I’ll go over the one at−kandunder the one at+k(Figure 10.9). (You’re welcome to choose some other convention if you like—even winding seven times around each pole—you’ll get a different Green’s function, but, as I’ll show you in a minute, they’re all equally acceptable.)12 For each integral in Equation 10.61 I must “close the contour” in such a way that the semi- circle at inﬁnity contributes nothing. In the case of I1, the factor eisrgoes to zero when shas a large positive imaginary part; for this one I close above (Figure 10.10 (a)).

(10.63) In the case of I2, the factor e−isrgoes to zero when shas a large negative imaginary part, so we close below (Figure 10.10(b)); this time the contour encloses the singularity at s=−k(and it goes around in the clockwise direction, so we pick up a minus sign): I2=−/contintegraldisplay/bracketleftbiggse−isr s−k/bracketrightbigg1 s+kds=−2πi/bracketleftbiggse−isr s−k/bracketrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle s=−k=−iπeikr. (10.64) Conclusion: G(r)=i 8π2r/bracketleftBig/parenleftBig iπeikr/parenrightBig −/parenleftBig −iπeikr/parenrightBig/bracketrightBig =−eikr 4πr. (10.65) 12If you are unfamiliar with this technique you have every right to be suspicious. In truth, the integral in Equation 10.60 is simply ill-deﬁned—it does not converge, and it’s something of a miracle that we can make sense of it at all. The root of the problem is that G(r)doesn’t really have a legitimate Fourier transform; we’re exceeding the speed limit, here, and just hoping we won’t get caught.10.4 The Born Approximation 391 This, ﬁnally, is the Green’s function for the Helmholtz equation—the solution to Equa- tion10.52 . (If you got lost in all that analysis, you might want to check the result by direct differentiation—see Problem 10.8.) Or rather, it is aGreen’s function for the Helmholtz equa- tion, for we can add to G(r)any function G0(r)that satisﬁes the homogeneous Helmholtz equation:/parenleftBig ∇2+k2/parenrightBig G0(r)=0; (10.66) clearly, the result (G+G0)still satisﬁes Equation 10.52 . This ambiguity corresponds precisely to the ambiguity in how to skirt the poles—a different choice amounts to picking a different function G0(r). Returning to Equation 10.53 , the general solution to the Schrödinger equation takes the form ψ(r)=ψ0(r)−m 2π/planckover2pi12/integraldisplayeik|r−r0| |r−r0|V(r0)ψ(r0)d3r0, (10.67) whereψ0satisﬁes the free-particle Schrödinger equation, /parenleftBig ∇2+k2/parenrightBig ψ0=0. (10.68) Equation 10.67 is the integral form of the Schrödinger equation ; it is entirely equivalent to the more familiar differential form. At ﬁrst glance it looks like an explicit solution to the Schrödinger equation (for any potential)—which is too good to be true. Don’t be deceived: There’s aψunder the integral sign on the right hand side, so you can’t do the integral unless you already know the solution! Nevertheless, the integral form can be very powerful, and it is particularly well suited to scattering problems, as we’ll see in the following section. Problem 10.8 Check that Equation 10.65 satisﬁes Equation 10.52 , by direct substitution. Hint:∇2(1/r)=−4πδ3(r).13 ∗∗ Problem 10.9 Show that the ground state of hydrogen (Equation 4.80) satisﬁes the integral form of the Schrödinger equation, for the appropriate VandE(note that Eisnegative ,s o k=iκ, whereκ≡√ −2mE//planckover2pi1). 10.4.2 The First Born Approximation Suppose V(r0)is localized about r0=0—that is, the potential drops to zero outside some ﬁnite region (as is typical for a scattering problem), and we want to calculate ψ(r)at points far away from the scattering center. Then |r|/greatermuch|r0|for all points that contribute to the integral in Equation 10.67 ,s o |r–r 0|2=r2+r2 0−2r·r0≈r2/parenleftBig 1−2r·r0 r2/parenrightBig , (10.69) and hence 13See, for example, D. Grifﬁths, Introduction to Electrodynamics , 4th edn (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2017), Section 1.5.3.392 CHAPTER 10 Scattering |r–r 0|≈r−ˆr·r0. (10.70) Let k≡kˆr; (10.71) then eik|r−r0|≈eikre−ik·r0, (10.72) and therefore eik|r-r 0| |r−r0|≈eikr re−ik·r0. (10.73) (In the denominator we can afford to make the more radical approximation |r–r 0|≈r;i nt h e exponent we need to keep the next term. If this puzzles you, try including the next term in the expansion of the denominator. What we are doing is expanding in powers of the small quantity (r0/r), and dropping all but the lowest order.) In the case of scattering, we want ψ0(r)=Aeikz, (10.74) representing an incident plane wave. For large r, then, ψ(r)≈Aeikz−m 2π/planckover2pi12eikr r/integraldisplay e−ik·r0V(r0)ψ(r0)d3r0. (10.75) This is in the standard form (Equation 10.12 ), and we can read off the scattering amplitude: f(θ,φ)=−m 2π/planckover2pi12A/integraldisplay e−ik·r0V(r0)ψ(r0)d3r0. (10.76) This is exact .14Now we invoke the Born approximation : Suppose the incoming plane wave isnot substantially altered by the potential; then it makes sense to use ψ(r0)≈ψ0(r0)=Aeikz0=Aeik/prime·r0, (10.77) where k/prime≡kˆz, (10.78) inside the integral. (This would be the exact wave function, if Vwere zero; it is essentially a weak potential approximation.15) In the Born approximation, then, f(θ,φ)≈−m 2π/planckover2pi12/integraldisplay ei(k/prime−k)·r0V(r0)d3r0. (10.79) (In case you have lost track of the deﬁnitions of k/primeandk, they both have magnitude k,b u tt h e former points in the direction of the incident beam, while the latter points toward the detector— see Figure 10.11 ;/planckover2pi1/parenleftbig k−k/prime/parenrightbig is the momentum transfer in the process.) 14Remember, f(θ,φ)is by deﬁnition the coefﬁcient of Aeikr/ratlarge r . 15Typically, partial wave analysis is useful when the incident particle has low energy, for then only the ﬁrst few terms in the series contribute signiﬁcantly; the Born approximation is more useful at high energy, when the deﬂection is relatively small.10.4 The Born Approximation 393 κ=k′−k k′=kzˆk=krˆ θ Figure 10.11: Two wave vectors in the Born approximation: k/primepoints in the incident direction, kin the scattered direction. In particular, for low energy (long wavelength) scattering , the exponential factor is essentially constant over the scattering region, and the Born approximation simpliﬁes to f(θ,φ)≈−m 2π/planckover2pi12/integraldisplay V(r)d3r,(low energy). (10.80) (I dropped the subscript on r, since there is no likelihood of confusion at this point.) Example 10.4 Low-energy soft-sphere scattering.16Suppose V(r)=/braceleftBigg V0,(r≤a), 0,(r>a).(10.81) In this case the low-energy scattering amplitude is f(θ,φ)≈−m 2π/planckover2pi12V0/parenleftbigg4 3πa3/parenrightbigg , (10.82) (independent of θandφ), the differential cross-section is dσ d/Omega1=|f|2≈/parenleftbigg2mV0a3 3/planckover2pi12/parenrightbigg2 , (10.83) and the total cross-section is σ≈4π/parenleftbigg2mV0a3 3/planckover2pi12/parenrightbigg2 . (10.84) For a spherically symmetrical potential ,V(r)=V(r)—but notnecessarily at low energy—the Born approximation again reduces to a simpler form. Deﬁne κ≡k/prime−k, (10.85) 16You can’t apply the Born approximation to hard-sphere scattering (V0=∞)—the integral blows up. The point is that we assumed the potential is weak , and doesn’t change the wave function much in the scattering region. But a hard sphere changes it radically —from Aeikztozero.394 CHAPTER 10 Scattering and let the polar axis for the r0integral lie along κ, so that /parenleftbig k/prime−k/parenrightbig ·r0=κr0cosθ0.

(10.91) (You get to work out the integral for yourself, in Problem 10.11 .) Example 10.6 Rutherford scattering. If we put inβ=q1q2/4π/epsilon10,μ=0, the Yukawa potential reduces to the Coulomb potential, describing the electrical interaction of two point charges. Evidently the scattering amplitude is f(θ)≈−2mq1q2 4π/epsilon10/planckover2pi12κ2, (10.92) or (using Equations 10.89 and10.51 ): f(θ)≈−q1q2 16π/epsilon10Esin2(θ/2). (10.93) The differential cross-section is the square of this: dσ d/Omega1=/bracketleftbiggq1q2 16π/epsilon10Esin2(θ/2)/bracketrightbigg2 , (10.94) which is precisely the Rutherford formula (Equation 10.11 ). It happens that for the Coulomb potential classical mechanics, the Born approximation, and quantum ﬁeld the- ory all yield the same result. As they say in the computer business, the Rutherford formula is amazingly “robust.”10.4 The Born Approximation 395 ∗ Problem 10.10 Find the scattering amplitude, in the Born approximation, for soft-sphere scattering at arbitrary energy.

In the impulse approximation we begin by pretending that the particle keeps going in a straight line (Figure 10.12 ), and compute the transverse impulse that would be delivered to it in that case: I=/integraldisplay F⊥dt. (10.95) If the deﬂection is relatively small, this should be a good approximation to the transverse momentum imparted to the particle, and hence the scattering angle is θ≈tan−1(I/p), (10.96) where pis the incident momentum. This is, if you like, the “ﬁrst-order” impulse approximation (thezeroth -order is what we started with: no deﬂection at all). Likewise, in the zeroth-order Born approximation the incident plane wave passes by with no modiﬁcation, and what we bθ Scattering centerF⊥Actual trajectory Figure 10.12: The impulse approximation assumes that the particle continues undeﬂected, and calculates the transverse momentum delivered.396 CHAPTER 10 Scattering explored in the previous section is really the ﬁrst-order correction to this. But the same idea can be iterated to generate a series of higher-order corrections, which presumably converge to the exact answer. The integral form of the Schrödinger equation reads ψ(r)=ψ0(r)+/integraldisplay g(r–r 0)V(r0)ψ(r0)d3r0, (10.97) whereψ0is the incident wave, g(r)≡−m 2π/planckover2pi12eikr r(10.98) is the Green’s function (into which I have now incorporated the factor 2 m//planckover2pi12, for convenience), andVis the scattering potential. Schematically, ψ=ψ0+/integraldisplay gVψ. (10.99) Suppose we take this expression for ψ, and plug it in under the integral sign: ψ=ψ0+/integraldisplay gVψ0+/integraldisplay/integraldisplay gVgVψ. (10.100) Iterating this procedure, we obtain a formal series for ψ: ψ=ψ0+/integraldisplay gVψ0+/integraldisplay/integraldisplay gVgVψ0+/integraldisplay/integraldisplay/integraldisplay gVgVgVψ0+···. (10.101) In each integrand only the incident wave function(ψ0)appears, together with more and more powers of gV.T h e ﬁrstBorn approximation truncates the series after the second term, but it is pretty clear how one generates the higher-order corrections. The Born series can be represented diagrammatically as shown in Figure 10.13 . In zeroth orderψis untouched by the potential; in ﬁrst order it is “kicked” once, and then “propa- gates” out in some new direction; in second order it is kicked, propagates to a new location, is kicked again, and then propagates out; and so on. In this context the Green’s function is sometimes called the propagator —it tells you how the disturbance propagates between one interaction and the next. The Born series was the inspiration for Feynman’s formulation of rel- ativistic quantum mechanics, which is expressed entirely in terms of vertex factors(V)and propagators(g), connected together in Feynman diagrams .

The vectors Glmnare called reciprocal lattice vectors . Find the scattering angles (θ)at which peaks occur. If the neutron’s wavelength is equal to the crystal spacing a, what are the three smallest (nonzero) angles? Comment : Neutron diffraction is one method used, to determine crystal structures (electrons and x-rays can also be used and the same expression for the locations of the peaks holds). In this problem we looked at a cubic arrangement of atoms, but a different arrangement (hexagonal for example) would produce peaks at a different set of angles. Thus from the scattering data one can infer the underlying crystal structure. ∗∗∗ Problem 10.22 Two-dimensional scattering theory.

That factor drops out of the cross-section for scattering from a ﬁxed potential—giving the correct answer in Example 10.6—but would show up in the cross-section for scattering of identical particles.11QUANTUM DYNAMICS So far, practically everything we have done belongs to the subject that might properly be called quantum statics , in which the potential energy function is independent of time :V(r,t)= V(r). In that case the (time-dependent) Schrödinger equation, i/planckover2pi1∂/Psi1 ∂t=ˆH/Psi1, (11.1) can be solved by separation of variables: /Psi1(r,t)=ψ(r)e−iEt//planckover2pi1, (11.2) whereψ(r)satisﬁes the time- independent Schrödinger equation, ˆHψ=Eψ. (11.3) Because the time dependence of separable solutions is carried by the exponential factor/parenleftbig e−iEt//planckover2pi1/parenrightbig , which cancels out when we construct the physically relevant quantity |/Psi1|2,a l l probabilities and expectation values (for such states) are constant in time. By forming lin- ear combinations of these stationary states we obtain wave functions with more interesting time dependence, /Psi1(r,t)=/summationdisplay cnψn(r)e−iEnt//planckover2pi1, (11.4) but even then the possible values of the energy (En), and their respective probabilities/parenleftbig|cn|2/parenrightbig , are constant. If we want to allow for transitions (quantum jumps , as they are sometimes called) between one energy level and another, we must introduce a time-dependent potential ( quantum dynam- ics). There are precious few exactly solvable problems in quantum dynamics. However, if the time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian is small (compared to the time-independent part), it can be treated as a perturbation. The main purpose of this chapter is to develop time-dependent perturbation theory , and study its most important application: the emission or absorption of radiation by an atom. Problem 11.1 Why isn’t it trivial to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation ( 11.1), in its dependence on t? After all, it’s a ﬁrst-order differential equation. (a)How would you solve the equation df dt=kf (for f(t)),i fkwere a constant?11.1 Two-Level Systems 403 (b)What if kis itself a function of t?( H e r e k(t)and f(t)might also depend on other variables, such as r—it doesn’t matter.) (c)Why not do the same thing for the Schrödinger equation (with a time-dependent Hamiltonian)? To see that this doesn’t work, consider the simple case ˆH(t)=/braceleftBiggˆH1,(0<t<τ), ˆH2,(t>τ), whereˆH1andˆH2are themselves time-independent. If the solution in part (b) held for the Schrödinger equation, the wave function at time t>τwould be /Psi1(t)=e−i/bracketleftBig ˆH1τ+ˆH2(t−τ)/bracketrightBig //planckover2pi1/Psi1(0), but of course we could also write /Psi1(t)=e−iˆH2(t−τ)//planckover2pi1/Psi1(τ)=e−iˆH2(t−τ)//planckover2pi1e−iˆH1τ//planckover2pi1/Psi1(0). Why are these generally notthe same? [This is a subtle matter; if you want to pursue it further, see Problem 11.23 .] 11.1 TWO-LEVEL SYSTEMS To begin with, let us suppose that there are just twostates of the (unperturbed) system, ψaand ψb. They are eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, ˆH0: ˆH0ψa=Eaψa,andˆH0ψb=Ebψb, (11.5) and they are orthonormal: /angbracketleftbig ψi/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψj/angbracketrightbig =δij,(i,j=a,b). (11.6) Any state can be expressed as a linear combination of them; in particular, /Psi1(0)=caψa+cbψb. (11.7) The statesψaandψbmight be position-space wave functions, or spinors, or something more exotic—it doesn’t matter. It is the time dependence that concerns us here, so when I write /Psi1(t), I simply mean the state of the system at time t. In the absence of any perturbation, each component evolves with its characteristic wiggle factor: /Psi1(t)=caψae−iEat//planckover2pi1+cbψbe−iEbt//planckover2pi1. (11.8) Informally, we say that |ca|2is the “probability that the particle is in state ψa”—by which wereally mean the probability that a measurement of the energy would yield the value Ea. Normalization of /Psi1requires, of course, that |ca|2+|cb|2=1. (11.9) 11.1.1 The Perturbed System Now suppose we turn on a time-dependent perturbation, ˆH/prime(t). Sinceψaandψbconstitute a complete set, the wave function /Psi1(t)can still be expressed as a linear combination of them. The only difference is that caandcbare now functions of t :404 CHAPTER 11 Quantum Dynamics /Psi1(t)=ca(t)ψae−iEat//planckover2pi1+cb(t)ψbe−iEbt//planckover2pi1. (11.10) (I could absorb the exponential factors into ca(t)andcb(t), and some people prefer to do it this way, but I think it is nicer to keep visible the part of the time dependence that would be present even without the perturbation.) The whole problem is to determine caandcb, as functions of time. If, for example, the particle started out in the state ψa(ca(0)=1,cb(0)=0), and at some later time t1we ﬁnd that ca(t1)=0,cb(t1)=1, we shall report that the system underwent a transition fromψatoψb. We solve for ca(t)andcb(t)by demanding that /Psi1(t)satisfy the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, ˆH/Psi1=i/planckover2pi1∂/Psi1 ∂t,whereˆH=ˆH0+ˆH/prime(t). (11.11) From Equations 11.10 and11.11 , we ﬁnd: ca/parenleftBig ˆH0ψa/parenrightBig e−iEat//planckover2pi1+cb/parenleftBig ˆH0ψb/parenrightBig e−iEbt//planckover2pi1+ca/parenleftBig ˆH/primeψa/parenrightBig e−iEat//planckover2pi1 +cb/parenleftBig ˆH/primeψb/parenrightBig e−iEbt//planckover2pi1=i/planckover2pi1/bracketleftBig ˙caψae−iEat//planckover2pi1+˙cbψbe−iEbt//planckover2pi1 +caψa/parenleftbigg −iEa /planckover2pi1/parenrightbigg e−iEat//planckover2pi1+cbψb/parenleftbigg −iEb /planckover2pi1/parenrightbigg e−iEbt//planckover2pi1/bracketrightBig . In view of Equation 11.5, the ﬁrst two terms on the left cancel the last two terms on the right, and hence ca/parenleftBig ˆH/primeψa/parenrightBig e−iEat//planckover2pi1+cb/parenleftBig ˆH/primeψb/parenrightBig e−iEbt//planckover2pi1=i/planckover2pi1/parenleftBig ˙caψae−iEat//planckover2pi1+˙cbψbe−iEbt//planckover2pi1/parenrightBig .(11.12) To isolate˙ca, we use the standard trick: Take the inner product with ψa, and exploit the orthogonality of ψaandψb(Equation 11.6): ca/angbracketleftBig ψa/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψa/angbracketrightBig e−iEat//planckover2pi1+cb/angbracketleftBig ψa/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψb/angbracketrightBig e−iEbt//planckover2pi1=i/planckover2pi1˙cae−iEat//planckover2pi1.

Multiplying through by −(i//planckover2pi1)eiEat//planckover2pi1, we conclude that: ˙ca=−i /planckover2pi1/bracketleftBig caH/prime aa+cbH/prime abe−i(Eb−Ea)t//planckover2pi1/bracketrightBig . (11.14) Similarly, the inner product with ψbpicks out˙cb: ca/angbracketleftBig ψb/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψa/angbracketrightBig e−iEat//planckover2pi1+cb/angbracketleftBig ψb/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆH/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleψb/angbracketrightBig e−iEbt//planckover2pi1=i/planckover2pi1˙cbe−iEbt//planckover2pi1, and hence ˙cb=−i /planckover2pi1/bracketleftBig cbH/prime bb+caH/prime baei(Eb−Ea)t//planckover2pi1/bracketrightBig . (11.15) Equations 11.14 and11.15 determine ca(t)andcb(t); taken together, they are completely equivalent to the (time-dependent) Schrödinger equation, for a two-level system. Typically, the diagonal matrix elements of ˆH/primevanish (see Problem 11.5 for the general case): H/prime aa=H/prime bb=0. (11.16)11.1 Two-Level Systems 405 If so, the equations simplify: ˙ca=−i /planckover2pi1H/prime abe−iω0tcb,˙cb=−i /planckover2pi1H/prime baeiω0tca, (11.17) where ω0≡Eb−Ea /planckover2pi1. (11.18) (I’ll assume that Eb≥Ea,s oω0≥0.) ∗ Problem 11.2 A hydrogen atom is placed in a (time-dependent) electric ﬁeld E=E(t)ˆk. Calculate all four matrix elements H/prime ijof the perturbation ˆH/prime=eEz between the ground state(n=1)and the (quadruply degenerate) ﬁrst excited states (n=2). Also show that H/prime ii=0 for all ﬁve states. Note: There is only one integral to be done here, if you exploit oddness with respect to z; only one of the n=2 states is “accessible” from the ground state by a perturbation of this form, and therefore the system functions as a two-state conﬁguration—assuming transitions to higher excited states can be ignored. ∗ Problem 11.3 Solve Equation 11.17 for the case of a time-independent perturbation, assum- ing that ca(0)=1 and cb(0)=0. Check that|ca(t)|2+|cb(t)|2=1.Comment: Ostensibly, this system oscillates between “pure ψa” and “someψb.” Doesn’t this contradict my gen- eral assertion that no transitions occur for time-independent perturbations? No, but the reason is rather subtle: In this case ψaandψbare not, and never were, eigenstates of the Hamiltonian—a measurement of the energy never yields EaorEb. In time-dependent perturbation theory we typically contemplate turning onthe perturbation for a while, and then turning it offagain, in order to examine the system. At the beginning, and at the end, ψaandψbare eigenstates of the exact Hamiltonian, and only in this context does it make sense to say that the system underwent a transition from one to the other. For the present problem, then, assume that the perturbation was turned on at time t=0, and off again at time T—this doesn’t affect the calculations , but it allows for a more sensible interpretation of the result. ∗∗ Problem 11.4 Suppose the perturbation takes the form of a delta function (in time): ˆH/prime=ˆUδ(t); assume that Uaa=Ubb=0, and let Uab=U∗ ba≡α.I fca(−∞)=1 and cb(−∞)=0, ﬁnd ca(t)andcb(t), and check that |ca(t)|2+|cb(t)|2=1. What is the net probabil- ity(Pa→bfort→∞)that a transition occurs? Hint: You might want to treat the delta function as the limit of a sequence of rectangles. Answer: P a→b=sin2(|α|//planckover2pi1). 11.1.2 Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory So far, everything is exact : We have made no assumption about the sizeof the perturbation. But ifˆH/primeis “small,” we can solve Equation 11.17 by a process of successive approximations, as follows. Suppose the particle starts out in the lower state:406 CHAPTER 11 Quantum Dynamics ca(0)=1,cb(0)=0. (11.19) If there were no perturbation at all , they would stay this way forever: Zeroth Order: c(0) a(t)=1,c(0) b(t)=0. (11.20) (I’ll use a superscript in parentheses to indicate the order of the approximation.) To calculate the ﬁrst-order approximation, we insert the zeroth-order values on the right side of Equation 11.17 : First Order: dc(1) a dt=0⇒c(1) a(t)=1; dc(1) b dt=−i /planckover2pi1H/prime baeiω0t⇒c(1) b=−i /planckover2pi1/integraldisplayt 0H/prime ba/parenleftbig t/prime/parenrightbig eiω0t/primedt/prime. (11.21) Now we insert these expressions on the right side of Equation 11.17 to obtain the second -order approximation: Second Order: dc(2) a dt=−i /planckover2pi1H/prime abe−iω0t/parenleftbigg −i /planckover2pi1/parenrightbigg/integraldisplayt 0H/prime ba/parenleftbig t/prime/parenrightbig eiω0t/primedt/prime⇒ c(2) a(t)=1−1 /planckover2pi12/integraldisplayt 0H/prime ab/parenleftbig t/prime/parenrightbig e−iω0t/prime/bracketleftBigg/integraldisplayt/prime 0H/prime ba/parenleftbig t/prime/prime/parenrightbig eiω0t/prime/primedt/prime/prime/bracketrightBigg dt/prime, (11.22) while cbis unchanged(c(2) b(t)=c(1) b(t)). (Notice that c(2) a(t)includes the zeroth-order term; the second-order correction would be the integral part alone.) In principle, we could continue this ritual indeﬁnitely, always inserting the nth-order approx- imation into the right side of Equation 11.17 , and solving for the (n+1)th order. The zeroth order contains nofactors ofˆH/prime, the ﬁrst-order correction contains onefactor ofˆH/prime, the second- order correction has twofactors ofˆH/prime, and so on.1The error in the ﬁrst-order approximation is evident in the fact that/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglec(1) a(t)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2 +/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglec(1) b(t)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2 /negationslash=1( t h e exact coefﬁcients must, of course, obey Equation 11.9).

And the same goes for the higher orders. Equation 11.21 can be written in the form c(1) b(t)e−iEbt//planckover2pi1=−i /planckover2pi1/integraldisplayt 0e−iEb(t−t/prime)//planckover2pi1H/prime ba/parenleftbig t/prime/parenrightbig e−iEat/prime//planckover2pi1dt/prime(11.23) (where I’ve restored the exponential we factored out in Equation 11.10 ). This suggests a nice pictorial interpretation: reading from right to left, the system remains in state afrom time 0 to time t/prime(picking up the “wiggle factor” e−iEat/prime//planckover2pi1), makes a transition from state ato state bat time t/prime, and then remains in state buntil time t(picking up the “wiggle factor” e−iEb(t−t/prime)//planckover2pi1). This process is represented in Figure 11.1. (Don’t take the picture too literally: there is no 1Notice that cais modiﬁed in every even order, and cbin every oddorder; this would not be true if the perturbation included diagonal terms, or if the system started out in a linear combination of the two states.11.1 Two-Level Systems 407 a timeb Figure 11.1: Pictorial representation of Equation 11.23 . +ab aa Figure 11.2: Pictorial representation of Equation 11.24 . sharp transition between these states; in fact, you integrate over all the times t/primeat which this transition can occur.) This interpretation of the perturbation series is especially illuminating at higher orders and for multi-level systems, where the expressions become complicated. Consider Equation 11.22 , which can be written c(2) a(t)e−iEat//planckover2pi1=e−iEat//planckover2pi1+/parenleftbigg −i /planckover2pi1/parenrightbigg2/integraldisplayt 0/integraldisplayt/prime 0e−iEa(t−t/prime)//planckover2pi1 ×H/prime ab/parenleftbig t/prime/parenrightbig e−iEb(t/prime−t/prime/prime)//planckover2pi1H/prime ba/parenleftbig t/prime/prime/parenrightbig e−iEat/prime/prime//planckover2pi1dt/prime/primedt/prime. (11.24) The two terms here describe a process where the system remains in state afor the entire time, and a second process where the system transitions from atobat time t/prime/primeand then back to aat time t/prime. Graphically, this is shown in Figure 11.2. With the insight provided by these pictures, it is easy to write down the general result for a multi-level system:2 c(2) n(t)e−iEnt//planckover2pi1=δnie−iEit//planckover2pi1+/parenleftbigg−i /planckover2pi1/parenrightbigg/integraldisplayt 0e−iEn(t−t/prime)//planckover2pi1Hni/parenleftbig t/prime/parenrightbig e−iEit/prime//planckover2pi1dt/prime +/summationdisplay m/parenleftbigg −i /planckover2pi1/parenrightbigg2/integraldisplayt 0/integraldisplayt/prime 0e−iEn(t−t/prime)Hnm/parenleftbig t/prime/parenrightbig e−iEm(t/prime−t/prime/prime)//planckover2pi1 ×Hmi/parenleftbig t/prime/prime/parenrightbig e−iEit/prime/prime//planckover2pi1dt/prime/primedt/prime.

What is the limit of your expression from part (a)? Comment : This is an example of the adiabatic theorem (Section 11.5.2 ). 11.1.3 Sinusoidal Perturbations Suppose the perturbation has sinusoidal time dependence: ˆH/prime(r,t)=V(r)cos(ωt), (11.29)11.1 Two-Level Systems 409 so that H/prime ab=Vabcos(ωt), (11.30) where Vab≡/angbracketleftψa|V|ψb/angbracketright. (11.31) (As before, I’ll assume the diagonal matrix elements vanish, since this is almost always the case in practice.) To ﬁrst order (from now on we’ll work exclusively in ﬁrst order, and I’ll dispense with the superscripts) we have (Equation 11.21 ): cb(t)≈−i /planckover2pi1Vba/integraldisplayt 0cos/parenleftbig ωt/prime/parenrightbig eiω0t/primedt/prime=−iVba 2/planckover2pi1/integraldisplayt 0/bracketleftBig ei(ω0+ω)t/prime+ei(ω0−ω)t/prime/bracketrightBig dt/prime =−Vba 2/planckover2pi1/bracketleftbiggei(ω0+ω)t−1 ω0+ω+ei(ω0−ω)t−1 ω0−ω/bracketrightbigg . (11.32) That’s the answer , but it’s a little cumbersome to work with. Things simplify substantially if we restrict our attention to driving frequencies (ω)that are very close to the transition frequency(ω0), so that the second term in the square brackets dominates; speciﬁcally, we assume: ω0+ω/greatermuch|ω0−ω|. (11.33) This is not much of a limitation, since perturbations at other frequencies have a negligible probability of causing a transition anyway. Dropping the ﬁrst term, we have cb(t)≈−Vba 2/planckover2pi1ei(ω0−ω)t/2 ω0−ω/bracketleftBig ei(ω0−ω)t/2−e−i(ω0−ω)t/2/bracketrightBig =−iVba /planckover2pi1sin/bracketleftbig (ω0−ω)t/2/bracketrightbig ω0−ωei(ω0−ω)t/2. (11.34) The transition probability —the probability that a particle which started out in the state ψa will be found, at time t, in the stateψb—is Pa→b(t)=|cb(t)|2≈|Vab|2 /planckover2pi12sin2/bracketleftbig (ω0−ω)t/2/bracketrightbig (ω0−ω)2. (11.35) The most remarkable feature of this result is that, as a function of time, the tran- sition probability oscillates sinusoidally (Figure 11.4). After rising to a maximum of |Vab|2//planckover2pi12(ω0−ω)2—necessarily much less than 1, else the assumption that the perturba- tion is “small” would be invalid—it drops back down to zero! At times tn=2nπ/|ω0−ω|, where n=1,2,3,..., the particle is certain to be back in the lower state. If you want to maximize your chances of provoking a transition, you should notkeep the perturbation on for a long period; you do better to turn it off after a timeπ/|ω0−ω|, and hope to “catch” the system in the upper state. In Problem 11.9 it is shown that this “ﬂopping” is not an artifact of perturbation theory—it occurs also in the exact solution, though the ﬂopping frequency is modiﬁed somewhat. As I noted earlier, the probability of a transition is greatest when the driving frequency is close to the “natural” frequency, ω0.3This is illustrated in Figure 11.5, where Pa→bis plotted as a function of ω. The peak has a height of (|Vab|t/2/planckover2pi1)2and a width 4π/t; evidently it 3Forvery small t,Pa→b(t)is independent of ω; it takes a couple of cycles for the system to “realize” that the perturbation is periodic.410 CHAPTER 11 Quantum Dynamics P(t) t 2π |ω0 − ω|ω0 − ω|Vab| ()2 4π |ω0 − ω|6π |ω0 − ω|h Figure 11.4: Transition probability as a function of time, for a sinusoidal perturbation (Equation 11.35 ). P(ω) ω (ω0−2π/t) (ω0+2π/t)ω0 Figure 11.5: Transition probability as a function of driving frequency (Equation 11.35 ). gets higher and narrower as time goes on. (Ostensibly, the maximum increases without limit. However, the perturbation assumption breaks down before it gets close to 1, so we can believe the result only for relatively small t. In Problem 11.9 you will see that the exact result never exceeds 1.) ∗∗ Problem 11.9 The ﬁrst term in Equation 11.32 comes from the eiωt/2 part of cos(ωt), and the second from e−iωt/2. Thus dropping the ﬁrst term is formally equivalent to writing ˆH/prime=(V/2)e−iωt, which is to say, H/prime ba=Vba 2e−iωt,H/prime ab=Vab 2eiωt. (11.36) (The latter is required to make the Hamiltonian matrix hermitian—or, if you prefer, to pick out the dominant term in the formula analogous to Equation 11.32 forca(t).) Rabi noticed that if you make this so-called rotating wave approximation at the beginning of the calculation, Equation 11.17 can be solved exactly, with no need for perturbation theory, and no assumption about the strength of the ﬁeld. (a)Solve Equation 11.17 in the rotating wave approximation (Equation 11.36 ), for the usual initial conditions: ca(0)=1,cb(0)=0.

(d)At what time does the system ﬁrst return to its initial state? 11.2 EMISSION AND ABSORPTION OF RADIATION 11.2.1 Electromagnetic Waves An electromagnetic wave (I’ll refer to it as “light”, though it could be infrared, ultravio- let, microwave, x-ray, etc.; these differ only in their frequencies) consists of transverse (and mutually perpendicular) oscillating electric and magnetic ﬁelds (Figure 11.6). An atom, in the presence of a passing light wave, responds primarily to the electric component. If the wave- length is long (compared to the size of the atom), we can ignore the spatial v a r i a t i o ni nt h e ﬁeld;4the atom, then, is exposed to a sinusoidally oscillating electric ﬁeld E=E0cos(ωt)ˆk (11.38) (for the moment I’ll assume the light is monochromatic, and polarized along the zdirection). The perturbing Hamiltonian is5 H/prime=−qE0zcos(ωt), (11.39) where qis the charge of the electron.6Evidently7 H/prime ba=−℘E0cos(ωt),where℘≡q/angbracketleftψb|z|ψa/angbracketright. (11.40) xz y Direction of propagation Magnetic fieldElectric field Figure 11.6: An electromagnetic wave. 4For visible light λ∼5000 Å, while the diameter of an atom is around 1 Å, so this approximation is reasonable; but it would notbe for x-rays. Problem 11.31 explores the effect of spatial variation of the ﬁeld. 5The energy of a charge qin a static ﬁeld Eis−q/integraltext E·dr. You may well object to the use of an electro static formula for a manifestly time-dependent ﬁeld. I am implicitly assuming that the period of oscillation is long compared to the time it takes the charge to move around (within the atom). 6As usual, we assume the nucleus is heavy and stationary; it is the wave function of the electron that concerns us. 7The letter℘is supposed to remind you of electric dipole moment (for which, in electrodynamics, the letter pis customarily used—in this context it is rendered as a squiggly ℘to avoid confusion with momentum). Actually, ℘is the off-diagonal matrix element of the zcomponent of the dipole moment operator, qr. Because of its asso- ciation with electric dipole moments, radiation governed by Equation 11.40 is called electric dipole radiation ; it is overwhelmingly the dominant kind, at least in the visible region. See Problem 11.31 for generalizations and terminology.412 CHAPTER 11 Quantum Dynamics Typically,ψis an even or odd function of z; in either case z|ψ|2is odd, and integrates to zero (this is Laporte’s rule, Section 6.4.3 ; for some examples see Problem 11.2). This licenses our usual assumption that the diagonal matrix elements of ˆH/primevanish. Thus the interaction of light with matter is governed by precisely the kind of oscillatory perturbation we studied in Section 11.1.3 , with Vba=−℘E0. (11.41) 11.2.2 Absorption, Stimulated Emission, and Spontaneous Emission If an atom starts out in the “lower” state ψa, and you shine a polarized monochromatic beam of light on it, the probability of a transition to the “upper” state ψbis given by Equation 11.35 , which (in view of Equation 11.41 ) takes the form Pa→b(t)=/parenleftbigg|℘|E0 /planckover2pi1/parenrightbigg2sin2/bracketleftbig (ω0−ω)t/2/bracketrightbig (ω0−ω)2. (11.42) In this process, the atom absorbs energy Eb−Ea=/planckover2pi1ω0from the electromagnetic ﬁeld, so it’s called absorption . (Informally, we say that the atom has “absorbed a photon” (Figure 11.7(a).) Technically, the word “photon” belongs to quantum electrodynamics —the quantum theory of the electromagnetic ﬁeld—whereas we are treating the ﬁeld itself classically . But this language is convenient, as long as you don’t read too much into it.) I could, of course, go back and run the whole derivation for a system that starts off in the upper state(ca(0)=0,cb(0)=1). Do it for yourself, if you like; it comes out exactly the same —except that this time we’re calculating Pb→a=|ca(t)|2, the probability of a transition down to the lower level: Pb→a(t)=/parenleftbigg|℘|E0 /planckover2pi1/parenrightbigg2sin2/bracketleftbig (ω0−ω)t/2/bracketrightbig (ω0−ω)2. (11.43) (Ithasto come out this way—all we’re doing is switching a↔b, which substitutes −ω0 forω0. When we get to Equation 11.32 we now keep the ﬁrst term, with−ω0+ωin the denominator, and the rest is the same as before.) But when you stop to think of it, this is an absolutely astonishing result: If the particle is in the upper state, and you shine light on it, it can make a transition to the lower state, and in fact the probability of such a transition is exactly the same as for a transition upward from the lower state. This process, which was ﬁrst predicted by Einstein, is called stimulated emission . In the case of stimulated emission the electromagnetic ﬁeld gains energy /planckover2pi1ω0from the atom; we say that one photon went in and twophotons came out—the original one that caused the transition plus another one from the transition itself (Figure 11.7(b)). This raises the possibility ofampliﬁcation , for if I had a bottle of atoms, all in the upper state, and triggered it with a single incident photon, a chain reaction would occur, with the ﬁrst photon producing two, these two producing four, and so on. We’d have an enormous number of photons coming out, all with the same frequency and at virtually the same instant. This is the principle behind the laser(light b a (a) Absorptionb a (b) Stimulated emissionb a (c) Spontaneous emission Figure 11.7: Three ways in which light interacts with atoms: (a) absorption, (b) stimulated emission, (c) spontaneous emission.11.2 Emission and Absorption of Radiation 413 ampliﬁcation by s timulated e mission of r adiation). Note that it is essential (for laser action) to get a majority of the atoms into the upper state (a so-called population inversion ), because absorption (which costs one photon) competes with stimulated emission (which creates one); if you started with an even mixture of the two states, you’d get no ampliﬁcation at all. There is a third mechanism (in addition to absorption and stimulated emission) by which radiation interacts with matter; it is called spontaneous emission . Here an atom in the excited state makes a transition downward, with the release of a photon, but without any applied elec- tromagnetic ﬁeld to initiate the process (Figure 11.7(c)). This is the mechanism that accounts for the normal decay of an atomic excited state. At ﬁrst sight it is far from clear why sponta- neous emission should occur at all. If the atom is in a stationary state (albeit an excited one), and there is no external perturbation, it should just sit there forever. And so it would ,i fi tw e r e really free of all external perturbations. However, in quantum electrodynamics the ﬁelds are nonzero even in the ground state —just as the harmonic oscillator (for example) has nonzero energy (to wit: /planckover2pi1ω/2)in its ground state. You can turn out all the lights, and cool the room down to absolute zero, but there is still some electromagnetic radiation present, and it is this “zero point” radiation that serves to catalyze spontaneous emission. When you come right down to it, there is really no such thing as truly spontaneous emission; it’s allstimulated emission. The only distinction to be made is whether the ﬁeld that does the stimulating is one that youput there, or one that God put there. In this sense it is exactly the reverse of the classical radiative process, in which it’s allspontaneous, and there is no such thing as stimulated emission. Quantum electrodynamics is beyond the scope of this book,8but there is a lovely argument, due to Einstein,9which interrelates the three processes (absorption, stimulated emission, and spontaneous emission). Einstein did not identify the mechanism responsible for spontaneous emission (perturbation by the ground-state electromagnetic ﬁeld), but his results nevertheless enable us to calculate the spontaneous emission rate, and from that the natural lifetime of an excited atomic state.10Before we turn to that, however, we need to consider the response of an atom to non-monochromatic, unpolarized, incoherent electromagnetic waves coming in from all directions—such as it would encounter, for instance, if it were immersed in thermal radiation. 11.2.3 Incoherent Perturbations The energy density in an electromagnetic wave is11 u=/epsilon10 2E2 0, (11.44) 8For an accessible treatment see Rodney Loudon, The Quantum Theory of Light , 2nd edn (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1983). 9Einstein’s paper was published in 1917, well before the Schrödinger equation. Quantum electrodynamics comes into the argument via the Planck blackbody formula, which dates from 1900. 10For an alternative derivation using “seat-of-the-pants” quantum electrodynamics, see Problem 11.11 . 11David J. Grifﬁths, Introduction to Electrodynamics, 4th edn, (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2017), Section 9.2.3. In general, the energy per unit volume in electromagnetic ﬁelds is u=(/epsilon10/2)E2+(1/2μ0)B2. For electromagnetic waves, the electric and magnetic contributions are equal, so u=/epsilon10E2=/epsilon10E2 0cos2(ωt), and the average over a full cycle is (/epsilon10/2)E2 0, since the average of cos2(or sin2)i s1 / 2 .414 CHAPTER 11 Quantum Dynamics where E0is (as before) the amplitude of the electric ﬁeld. So the transition probability (Equation 11.43 ) is (not surprisingly) proportional to the energy density of the ﬁelds: Pb→a(t)=2u /epsilon10/planckover2pi12|℘|2sin2/bracketleftbig (ω0−ω)t/2/bracketrightbig (ω0−ω)2. (11.45) But this is for a monochromatic wave, at a single frequency ω. In many applications the system is exposed to electromagnetic waves at a whole range of frequencies; in that case u→ρ(ω)dω, whereρ(ω)dωis the energy density in the frequency range dω, and the net transition probability takes the form of an integral:12 Pb→a(t)=2 /epsilon10/planckover2pi12|℘|2/integraldisplay∞ 0ρ(ω)/braceleftBigg sin2/bracketleftbig (ω0−ω)t/2/bracketrightbig (ω0−ω)2/bracerightBigg dω. (11.46) The term in curly brackets is sharply peaked about ω0(Figure 11.5), whereasρ(ω) is ordinarily quite broad, so we may as well replace ρ(ω) byρ(ω 0), and take it outside the integral: Pb→a(t)≈2|℘|2 /epsilon10/planckover2pi12ρ(ω0)/integraldisplay∞ 0sin2/bracketleftbig (ω0−ω)t/2/bracketrightbig (ω0−ω)2dω. (11.47) Changing variables to x≡(ω0−ω)t/2, extending the limits of integration to x=±∞ (since the integrand is essentially zero out there anyway), and looking up the deﬁnite integral /integraldisplay∞ −∞sin2x x2dx=π, (11.48) we ﬁnd Pb→a(t)≈π|℘|2 /epsilon10/planckover2pi12ρ(ω0)t. (11.49) This time the transition probability is proportional to t. The bizarre “ﬂopping” phenomenon characteristic of a monochromatic perturbation gets “washed out” when we hit the system with an incoherent spread of frequencies. In particular, the transition rate (R≡dP/dt)is now a constant : Rb→a=π /epsilon10/planckover2pi12|℘|2ρ(ω0). (11.50) Up to now, we have assumed that the perturbing wave is coming in along the ydirection (Figure 11.6), and polarized in the zdirection. But we are interested in the case of an atom bathed in radiation coming from alldirections, and with all possible polarizations; the energy in the ﬁelds(ρ(ω))is shared equally among these different modes. What we need, in place of |℘|2,i st h e average of|℘·ˆn|2, where ℘≡q/angbracketleftψb|r|ψa/angbracketright (11.51) (generalizing Equation 11.40 ), and the average is over all polarizations and all incident directions. 12Equation 11.46 assumes that the perturbations at different frequencies are independent , so that the total transition probability is a sum of the individual probabilities. If the different components are coherent (phase-correlated), then we should add amplitudes(cb(t)), not probabilities(|cb(t)|2), and there will be cross-terms. For the applications we will consider the perturbations are always incoherent.11.2 Emission and Absorption of Radiation 415 xkˆnˆz y φθ Figure 11.8: Axes for the averaging of/vextendsingle/vextendsingle℘·ˆn/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2.

The absorption rate is likewise proportional toρ(ω0)—call it Babρ(ω0); the number of particles per unit time joining the upper level is therefore NaBabρ(ω0). All told, then, dNb dt=− NbA−NbBbaρ(ω0)+NaBabρ(ω0). (11.55) Suppose these atoms are in thermal equilibrium with the ambient ﬁeld, so that the number of particles in each level is constant . In that case dNb/dt=0, and it follows that ρ(ω0)=A (Na/Nb)Bab−Bba. (11.56) On the other hand, we know from statistical mechanics16that the number of particles with energy E, in thermal equilibrium at temperature T, is proportional to the Boltzmann factor , exp(−E/kBT),s o Na Nb=e−Ea/kBT e−Eb/kBT=e/planckover2pi1ω0/kBT, (11.57) and hence ρ(ω0)=A e/planckover2pi1ω0/kBTBab−Bba. (11.58) But Planck’s blackbody formula17tells us the energy density of thermal radiation: ρ(ω)=/planckover2pi1 π2c3ω3 e/planckover2pi1ω/kBT−1; (11.59) comparing the two expressions, we conclude that Bab=Bba (11.60) and A=ω3 0/planckover2pi1 π2c3Bba. (11.61) 14Normally I’d use Rfor a transition rate, but out of deference to der Alte everyone follows Einstein’s notation in this context. 15Assume that NaandNbare very large, so we can treat them as continuous functions of time and ignore statistical ﬂuctuations. 16See, for example, Daniel Schroeder, An Introduction to Thermal Physics (Pearson, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 2000), Section 6.1. 17Schroeder, footnote 16, Section 7.4.11.3 Spontaneous Emission 417 Equation 11.60 conﬁrms what we already knew: the transition rate for stimulated emission is the same as for absorption. But it was an astonishing result in 1917—indeed, Einstein was forced to “invent” stimulated emission in order to reproduce Planck’s formula. Our present attention, however, focuses on Equation 11.61 , for this tells us the spontaneous emis- sion rate(A)—which is what we are looking for—in terms of the stimulated emission rate (Bbaρ(ω 0))—which we already know. From Equation 11.54 we read off Bba=π 3/epsilon10/planckover2pi12|℘|2, (11.62) and it follows that the spontaneous emission rate is A=ω3 0|℘|2 3π/epsilon10/planckover2pi1c3. (11.63) Problem 11.10 As a mechanism for downward transitions, spontaneous emission competes with thermally stimulated emission (stimulated emission for which blackbody radiation is the source). Show that at room temperature ( T=300 K) thermal stimulation dominates for frequencies well below 5 ×1012Hz, whereas spontaneous emission dominates for frequencies well above 5 ×1012Hz. Which mechanism dominates for visible light? Problem 11.11 You could derive the spontaneous emission rate (Equation 11.63 ) without the detour through Einstein’s AandBcoefﬁcients if you knew the ground state energy density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, ρ0(ω), for then it would simply be a case of stimulated emission (Equation 11.54 ). To do this honestly would require quantum electrodynamics, but if you are prepared to believe that the ground state consists of one photon in each classical mode , then the derivation is fairly simple: (a)To obtain the classical modes, consider an empty cubical box, of side l, with one corner at the origin. Electromagnetic ﬁelds (in vacuum) satisfy the classical wave equation18 /parenleftbigg1 c2∂2 ∂t2−∇2/parenrightbigg f(x,y,z,t)=0, where fstands for any component of Eor of B.

What, then, is the total energy per unit volume in the frequency range dω, if each mode gets one photon? Express your answer in the form 1 l3dE=ρ0(ω)dω and read offρ0(ω).Hint: refer to Figure 5.3. (c)Use your result, together with Equation 11.54 , to obtain the spontaneous emission rate. Compare Equation 11.63 . 11.3.2 The Lifetime of an Excited State Equation 11.63 is our fundamental result; it gives the transition rate for spontaneous emission. Suppose, now, that you have somehow pumped a large number of atoms into the excited state. As a result of spontaneous emission, this number will decrease as time goes on; speciﬁcally, in a time interval dtyou will lose a fraction Adt of them: dNb=− ANbdt, (11.64) (assuming there is no mechanism to replenish the supply).19Solving for Nb(t), we ﬁnd: Nb(t)=Nb(0)e−At; (11.65) evidently the number remaining in the excited state decreases exponentially, with a time constant τ=1 A. (11.66) We call this the lifetime of the state—technically, it is the time it takes for Nb(t)to reach 1/e≈0.368 of its initial value. I have assumed all along that there are only twostates for the system, but this was just for notational simplicity—the spontaneous emission formula (Equation 11.63 ) gives the transition rate forψb→ψaregardless of what other states may be accessible (see Problem 11.24 ). Typically, an excited atom has many different decay modes (that is:ψbcan decay to a large number of different lower-energy states, ψa1,ψa2,ψa3, ...) . I n t h a t c a s e t h e t r a n s ition rates add, and the net lifetime is τ=1 A1+A2+A3+···. (11.67) 19This situation is not to be confused with the case of thermal equilibrium, which we considered in the previous section. We assume here that the atoms have been lifted outof equilibrium, and are in the process of cascading back down to their equilibrium levels.11.3 Spontaneous Emission 419 Example 11.1 Suppose a charge qis attached to a spring and constrained to oscillate along the xaxis. Say it starts out in the state |n/angbracketright(Equation 2.68), and decays by spontaneous emission to state |n/prime/angbracketright. From Equation 11.51 we have ℘=q/angbracketleftbig n/vextendsingle/vextendsinglex/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/prime/angbracketrightbig ˆı. You calculated the matrix elements of xback in Problem 3.39: /angbracketleftbig n/vextendsingle/vextendsinglex/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/prime/angbracketrightbig =/radicalbigg /planckover2pi1 2mω/parenleftBig√ n/primeδn,n/prime−1+√nδn/prime,n−1/parenrightBig , whereωis the natural frequency of the oscillator (I no longer need this letter for the fre- quency of the stimulating radiation). But we’re talking about emission ,s on/primemust be lower than n; for our purposes, then, ℘=q/radicalbigg n/planckover2pi1 2mωδn/prime,n−1ˆı. (11.68) Evidently transitions occur only to states one step lower on the “ladder”, and the frequency of the photon emitted is ω0=En−En/prime /planckover2pi1=(n+1/2)/planckover2pi1ω−/parenleftbig n/prime+1/2/parenrightbig /planckover2pi1ω /planckover2pi1=/parenleftbig n−n/prime/parenrightbig ω=ω. (11.69) Not surprisingly, the system radiates at the classical oscillator frequency. The transition rate (Equation 11.63 )i s A=nq2ω2 6π/epsilon10mc3, (11.70) and the lifetime of the nth stationary state is τn=6π/epsilon10mc3 nq2ω2. (11.71) Meanwhile, each radiated photon carries an energy /planckover2pi1ω,s ot h e power radiated is A/planckover2pi1ω: P=q2ω2 6π/epsilon10mc3(n/planckover2pi1ω), or, since the energy of an oscillator in the nth state is E=(n+1/2)/planckover2pi1ω, P=q2ω2 6π/epsilon10mc3/parenleftbigg E−1 2/planckover2pi1ω/parenrightbigg . (11.72) This is the average power radiated by a quantum oscillator with (initial) energy E. For comparison, let’s determine the average power radiated by a classical oscillator with the same energy. According to classical electrodynamics, the power radiated by an accelerating charge qis given by the Larmor formula :20 P=q2a2 6π/epsilon10c3. (11.73) 20See, for example, Grifﬁths, footnote 11, Section 11.2.1 .420 CHAPTER 11 Quantum Dynamics For a harmonic oscillator with amplitude x0,x(t)=x0cos(ωt), and the acceleration is a=−x0ω2cos(ωt). Averaging over a full cycle, then, P=q2x2 0ω4 12π/epsilon10c3. But the energy of the oscillator is E=(1/2)mω2x2 0,s ox2 0=2E/mω2, and hence P=q2ω2 6π/epsilon10mc3E. (11.74) This is the average power radiated by a classical oscillator with energy E. In the classical limit(/planckover2pi1→0)the classical and quantum formulas agree;21however, the quantum formula (Equation 11.72 ) protects the ground state: If E=(1/2)/planckover2pi1ωthe oscillator does not radiate. Problem 11.12 The half-life/parenleftbig t1/2/parenrightbig of an excited state is the time it would take for half the atoms in a large sample to make a transition. Find the relation between t1/2andτ(the “lifetime” of the state). ∗ Problem 11.13 Calculate the lifetime (in seconds) for each of the four n=2 states of hydrogen. Hint: You’ll need to evaluate matrix elements of the form /angbracketleftψ100|x|ψ200/angbracketright, /angbracketleftψ100|y|ψ211/angbracketright, and so on. Remember that x=rsinθcosφ,y=rsinθsinφ, and z=rcosθ. Most of these integrals are zero, so inspect them closely before you start calculating. Answer: 1.60×10−9seconds for all except ψ200, which is inﬁnite. 11.3.3 Selection Rules The calculation of spontaneous emission rates has been reduced to a matter of evaluating matrix elements of the form /angbracketleftψb|r|ψa/angbracketright. As you will have discovered if you worked Problem 11.13 , (if you didn’t , go back right now anddoso!) these quantities are very often zero, and it would be helpful to know in advance when this is going to happen, so we don’t waste a lot of time evaluating unnecessary integrals. Suppose we are interested in systems like hydrogen, for which the Hamiltonian is spherically symmetrical. In that case we can specify the states with the usual quantum numbers n,/lscript, and m, and the matrix elements are /angbracketleftbig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingler/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightbig . Now, ris a vector operator, and we can invoke the results of Chapter 6to obtain the selection rules22 /Delta1/lscript≡/lscript/prime−/lscript=±1,/Delta1 m≡m/prime−m=0o r±1. (11.75) 21This is an example of Bohr’s Correspondence Principle . In fact, if we express Pin terms of the energy above the ground state , the two formulas are identical. 22See Equation 6.62 (Equation 6.26 eliminates/Delta1/lscript=0), or derive them from scratch using Problems 11.14 and 11.15 .11.3 Spontaneous Emission 421 n=1n=2n=3n=4 Figure 11.9: Allowed decays for the ﬁrst four Bohr levels in hydrogen. These conditions follow from symmetry alone. If they are notmet, then the matrix element is zero, and the transition is said to be forbidden . Moreover, it follows from Equations 6.56–6.58 that⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ifm/prime=m, then/angbracketleftbig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsinglex/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingley/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightbig =0, ifm/prime=m±1,then/angbracketleftbig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsinglex/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightbig =±i/angbracketleftbig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingley/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightbig and/angbracketleftbig n/prime/lscript/primem/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsinglez/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/lscriptm/angbracketrightbig =0.(11.76) So it is never necessary to compute the matrix elements of both x and y ; you can always get one from the other. Evidently not all transitions to lower-energy states can proceed by electric dipole radiation; most are forbidden by the selection rules. The scheme of allowed transitions for the ﬁrst four Bohr levels in hydrogen is shown in Figure 11.9. Notice that the 2 Sstate(ψ200)is “stuck”: it cannot decay, because there is no lower-energy state with /lscript=1. It is called a metastable state, and its lifetime is indeed much longer than that of, for example, the 2 Pstates(ψ211,ψ210, andψ21−1). Metastable states do eventually decay, by collisions, or by “forbidden” transitions (Problem 11.31 ), or by multiphoton emission.

(a)What decay routes are open to it? Specify them in the following way: |300/angbracketright→|n/lscriptm/angbracketright→/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/prime/lscript/primem/prime/angbracketrightbig →···→|100/angbracketright. (b)If you had a bottle full of atoms in this state, what fraction of them would decay via each route? (c)What is the lifetime of this state? Hint: Once it’s made the ﬁrst transition, it’s no longer in the state |300/angbracketright, so only the ﬁrst step in each sequence is relevant in computing the lifetime. 11.4 FERMI’S GOLDEN RULE In the previous sections we considered transitions between two discrete energy states, such as two bound states of an atom. We saw that such a transition was most likely when the ﬁnal energy satisﬁed the resonance condition: Ef=Ei+/planckover2pi1ω, whereωis the frequency associated with the perturbation. I now want to look at the case where Effalls in a continuum of states (Figure 11.10 ). To stick close to the example of Section 11.2, if the radiation is energetic enough it can ionize the atom—the photoelectric effect —exciting the electron from a bound state into the continuum of scattering states. We can’t talk about a transition to a precise state in that continuum (any more than we can talk about someone being precisely 16 years old), but we can compute the probability that the system makes a transition to a state with an energy in some ﬁnite range /Delta1Eabout Ef. That is given by the integral of Equation 11.35 over all the ﬁnal states: P=/integraldisplayEf+/Delta1E/2 Ef−/Delta1E/2|Vin|2 /planckover2pi12/braceleftBigg sin2/bracketleftbig (ω0−ω)t/2/bracketrightbig (ω0−ω)2/bracerightBigg ρ(En)dEn, (11.79) EiEf EiΔE (a)( b) Figure 11.10: A transition (a) between two discrete states and (b) between a discrete state and a continuum of states.11.4 Fermi’s Golden Rule 423 whereω0=(En−Ei)//planckover2pi1. The quantityρ(E)dEis the number of states with energy between EandE+dE;ρ(E)is called the density of states , and I’ll show you how it’s calculated in Example 11.2. At short times, Equation 11.79 leads to a transition probability proportional to t2,j u s ta s for a transition between discrete states. On the other hand, at long times the quantity in curly brackets in Equation 11.79 is sharply peaked: as a function of Enits maximum occurs at Ef=Ei+/planckover2pi1ωand the central peak has a width of 4 π/planckover2pi1/t. For sufﬁciently large t, we can therefore approximate Equation 11.79 as23 P=/vextendsingle/vextendsingleVif/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2 /planckover2pi12ρ/parenleftbig Ef/parenrightbig/integraldisplay∞ −∞sin2/bracketleftbig (ω0−ω)t/2/bracketrightbig (ω0−ω)2dEn. The remaining integral was already evaluated in Section 11.2.3 : P=2π /planckover2pi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleVif 2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2 ρ/parenleftbig Ef/parenrightbig t. (11.80) The oscillatory behavior of Phas again been “washed out,” giving a constant transition rate:24 R=2π /planckover2pi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleVif 2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2 ρ/parenleftbig Ef/parenrightbig . (11.81) Equation 11.81 is known as Fermi’s Golden Rule .25Apart from the factor of 2 π//planckover2pi1, it says that the transition rate is the square of the matrix element (this encapsulates all the relevant information about the dynamics of the process) times the density of states (how many ﬁnal states are accessible, given the energy supplied by the perturbation—the more roads are open, the faster the trafﬁc will ﬂow). It makes sense. 23This is the same set of approximations we made in Equations 11.46 –11.48 . 24In deriving Equation 11.35 , our perturbation was ˆH/prime=Vcos(ωt)→V 2e−iωt since we dropped the other (off-resonance) exponential. That is the source of the two inside the absolute value in Equation 11.81 . Fermi’s Golden rule can also be applied to a constant perturbation, ˆH/prime=ˆV,i fw es e tω=0d r o p the 2: R=2π /planckover2pi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingleVif/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2ρ/parenleftbig Ef/parenrightbig . 25It is actually due to Dirac, but Fermi is the one who gave it the memorable name. See T. Visser, A m .J .P h y s . 77, 487 (2009) for the history. Fermi’s Golden Rule doesn’t just apply to transitions to a continuum of states. For instance, Equation 11.54 can be considered an example. In that case, we integrated over a continuous range of perturbation frequencies —not a continuum of ﬁnal states—but the end result is the same.424 CHAPTER 11 Quantum Dynamics Example 11.2 Use Fermi’s Golden Rule to obtain the differential scattering cross-section for a particle of mass mand incident wave vector k/primescattering from a potential V(r)(Figure 11.11 ). V =0k k′detector ⁄ Figure 11.11: A particle with incident wave vector k/primeis scattered into a state with wave vector k. Solution : We take our initial and ﬁnal states to be plane waves: ψi=1√ l3eik/prime·randψf=1√ l3eik·r. (11.82) Here I’ve used a technique called box normalization ; I place the whole setup inside a box of length lon a side. This makes the free-particle states normalizable and countable. Formally, we want the limit l→∞ ; in practice lwill drop out of our ﬁnal expression.

(11.84) We need to determine the density of states. In a scattering experiment we measure the number of particles scatterred into a solid angle d/Omega1. We want to count the number of states with energies between EandE+dE, with wave vectors klying inside d/Omega1.I nkspace these states occupy a section of a spherical shell of radius kand thickness dkthat subtends a solid angle d/Omega1; it has a volume k2dk d/Omega1 and contains a number of states27 ρ(E)dE=k2dk d/Omega1 (2π/l)3=/parenleftbiggl 2π/parenrightbigg3 k2dk dEdEd/Omega1. 26Periodic boundary conditions are discussed in Problem 5.39. In the present context we use periodic boundary conditions—as opposed to impenetrable walls—because they admit traveling-wave solutions. 27Each state in k-space “occupies” a volume of (2π/l)3, as shown in Problem 5.39.11.4 Fermi’s Golden Rule 425 Since E=/planckover2pi12k2/2mthis gives ρ(E)=/parenleftbiggl 2π/parenrightbigg3√ 2m3E /planckover2pi13d/Omega1. (11.85) From Fermi’s Golden Rule, the rate at which particles are scattered into the solid angle d/Omega1is28 Ri→d/Omega1=2π /planckover2pi11 l6/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay ei(k/prime−k)·rV(r)d3r/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2/parenleftbiggl 2π/parenrightbigg3/radicalBig 2m3Ef /planckover2pi13d/Omega1. This is closely related to the differential scattering cross section: dσ d/Omega1=Ri→d/Omega1 Jid/Omega1(11.86) where Jiis the ﬂux (or probability current) of incident particles. For an incident wave of the formψi=Aeik/prime·r/prime, the probability current is (Equation 4.220 ). Ji=|A|2v=1 l3/planckover2pi1k/prime m(11.87) and dσ d/Omega1=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle−m 2π/planckover2pi12/integraldisplay ei(k−k/prime)·rV(r)d3r/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2 . (11.88) This is exactly what we got from the ﬁrst Born approximation (Equation 10.79 ). ∗∗∗ Problem 11.17 In the photoelectric effect, light can ionize an atom if its energy (/planckover2pi1ω) exceeds the binding energy of the electron. Consider the photoelectric effect for the ground state of hydrogen, where the electron is kicked out with momentum /planckover2pi1k. The initial state of the electron is ψ0(r)(Equation 4.80) and its ﬁnal state is29 ψf=1√ l3eik·r, as in Example 11.2. (a)For light polarized along the zdirection, use Fermi’s Golden Rule to compute the rate at which electrons are ejected into the solid angle d/Omega1in the dipole approximation.30 /bracketleftBigg Answer:Ri→d/Omega1=256/epsilon10E2 0a3 /planckover2pi1(ka)3 /bracketleftbig 1+(ka)2/bracketrightbig6cos2θd/Omega1./bracketrightBigg 28See footnote 24. 29This is an approximation; we really should be using a scattering state of hydrogen. For an extended discussion of the photoelectric effect, including comparison to experiment and the validity of this approximation, see W. Heitler, The Quantum Theory of Radiation , 3rd edn, Oxford University Press, London (1954), Section 21. 30The result here is too large by a factor of four; correcting this requires a more careful derivation of the matrix ele- ment for radiative transitions (see Problem 11.30 ). Only the overall factor is affected though; the more interesting features (the dependence on kandθ)are correct.426 CHAPTER 11 Quantum Dynamics Hint:To evaluate the matrix element, use the following trick. Write zeik·r=−id dkzeik·r, pulld/dkzoutside the integral, and what remains is straightforward to compute. (b)Thephotoelectric cross section is deﬁned as σ(k)=Ri→all/planckover2pi1ω 1 2/epsilon10E2 0c where the quantity in the numerator is the rate at which energy is absorbed(/planckover2pi1ω= /planckover2pi12k2 2m−E1per photoelectron) and the quantity in the denominator is the intensity of the incident light. Integrate your result from (a) over all angles to obtain Ri→all, and compute the photoelectric cross section. (c)Obtain a numerical value for the photoelectric cross section for ultraviolet light of wavelength 220 Å (n.b. this is the wavelength of the incident light, not the scattered electron). Express your answer in mega-barns/parenleftbig Mb=10−22m2/parenrightbig . 11.5 THE ADIABATIC APPROXIMATION 11.5.1 Adiabatic Processes Imagine a perfect pendulum, with no friction or air resistance, oscillating back and forth in a vertical plane. If you grab the support and shake it in a jerky manner the bob will swing around chaotically. But if you very gently move the support (Figure 11.12 ), the pendulum will continue to swing in a nice smooth way, in the same plane (or one parallel to it), with the same amplitude. This gradual change of the external conditions deﬁnes an adiabatic process. Notice that there are two characteristic times involved: Ti, the “internal” time, representing the motion of the system itself (in this case the period of the pendulum’s oscillations), and Te, the “external” time, over which the parameters of the system change appreciably (if the pendulum were mounted on a rotating platform, for example, Tewould be the period of the platform’s motion). An adiabatic process is one for which Te/greatermuchTi(the pendulum executes many oscillations before the platform has moved appreciably).31 What if I took this pendulum up to the North Pole, and set it swinging—say, in the direction of Portland (Figure 11.13 ). For the moment, pretend the earth is not rotating. Very gently (that is,adiabatically ), I carry it down the longitude line passing through Portland, to the equator. At this point it is swinging north-south. Now I carry it (still swinging north–south) part way around the equator. And ﬁnally, I take it back up to the North Pole, along the new longitude line. The pendulum will no longer be swinging in the same plane as it was when I set out— indeed, the new plane makes an angle /Theta1with the old one, where /Theta1is the angle between the southbound and the northbound longitude lines. More generally, if you transport the pendulum around a closed loop on the surface of the earth, the angular deviation (between the initial plane of the swing and the ﬁnal plane) is equal to the solid angle subtended by the path with respect to the center of the sphere, as you can prove for yourself if you are interested. Incidentally, the Foucault pendulum is an example of precisely this sort of adiabatic trans- port around a closed loop on a sphere—only this time instead of mecarrying the pendulum 31For an interesting discussion of classical adiabatic processes, see Frank S. Crawford, A m .J .P h y s . 58, 337 (1990).11.5 The Adiabatic Approximation 427 Figure 11.12: Adiabatic motion: If the case is transported very gradually, the pendulum inside keeps swinging with the same amplitude, in a plane parallel to the original one.

(11.89) Relative to the earth (which has meanwhile turned through an angle of 2 π), the daily precession of the Foucault pendulum is 2 πcosθ0—a result that is ordinarily obtained by appeal to Coriolis forces in the rotating reference frame,32but is seen in this context to admit a purely geometrical interpretation. 32See, for example, Jerry B. Marion and Stephen T. Thornton, Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems , 4th edn, Saunders, Fort Worth, TX (1995), Example 10.5. Geographers measure latitude (λ)up from the equator, rather than down from the pole, so cos θ0=sinλ.428 CHAPTER 11 Quantum Dynamics z θ0 Figure 11.14: Path of a Foucault pendulum, in the course of one day. The basic strategy for analyzing an adiabatic process is ﬁrst to solve the problem with the external parameters held constant , and only at the endof the calculation allow them to vary (slowly) with time. For example, the classical period of a pendulum of (ﬁxed) length Lis 2π√L/g; if the length is now gradually changing , the period will be 2 π√L(t)/g.Am o r e subtle subtle example occurred in our discussion of the hydrogen molecule ion (Section 8.3). We began by assuming that the nuclei were at rest , a ﬁxed distance Rapart, and we solved for the motion of the electron. Once we had found the ground state energy of the system as a function of R, we located the equilibrium separation and from the curvature of the graph we obtained the frequency of vibration of the nuclei (Problem 8.11). In molecular physics this technique (beginning with nuclei at rest, calculating electronic wave functions, and using these to obtain information about the positions and—relatively sluggish—motion of the nuclei) is known as the Born–Oppenheimer approximation . 11.5.2 The Adiabatic Theorem In quantum mechanics, the essential content of the adiabatic approximation can be cast in the form of a theorem. Suppose the Hamiltonian changes gradually from some initial form ˆH(0)to some ﬁnal form ˆH(T).T h e adiabatic theorem33states that if the particle was ini- tially in the nth eigenstate of ˆH(0), it will be carried (under the Schrödinger equation) into the nth eigenstate of ˆH(T). (I assume that the spectrum is discrete and nondegenerate throughout the transition, so there is no ambiguity about the ordering of the states; these conditions can be relaxed, given a suitable procedure for “tracking” the eigenfunctions, but I’m not going to pursue that here.) Example 11.3 Suppose we prepare a particle in the ground state of the inﬁnite square well (Fig- ure11.15 (a)): ψi(x)=/radicalbigg 2 asin/parenleftBigπ ax/parenrightBig . (11.90) 33The adiabatic theorem, which is usually attributed to Ehrenfest, is simple to state, and it sounds plausible, but it is not easy to prove. The argument will be found in earlier editions of this book, Section 10.1.2 .11.5 The Adiabatic Approximation 429 If we now gradually move the right wall out to 2 a, the adiabatic theorem says that the particle will end up in the ground state of the expanded well (Figure 11.15(b)): ψf(x)=/radicalbigg 1 asin/parenleftBigπ 2ax/parenrightBig , (11.91) (apart from a phase factor, which we’ll discuss in a moment). Notice that we’re not talking about a small change in the Hamiltonian (as in perturbation theory)—this one is huge .A l l we require is that it happen slowly . a (a)2a x a (b)ψf(x) ψi(x) ψi(x) 2a x a (c)2a x Figure 11.15: (a) Particle starts out in the ground state of the inﬁnite square well. (b) If the wall moves slowly , the particle remains in the ground state. (c) If the wall moves rapidly , the particle is left (momentarily) in its initial state. Energy is notconserved here—of course not: Whoever is moving the wall is extracting energy from the system, just like the piston on a slowly expanding cylinder of gas. By contrast, if the well expands suddenly , the resulting state is still ψi(x)(Figure 11.15 c), which is a complicated linear combination of eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian (Problem 11.18 ). In this case energy isconserved (at least, its expectation value is); as in the free expansion of a gas (into a vacuum) when the barrier is suddenly removed; no work is done. According to the adiabatic theorem, a system that starts out in the nth eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian(ˆH(0))will evolve as the nth eigenstate of the instantaneous Hamiltonian (ˆH(t)), as the Hamiltonian gradually changes. However, this doesn’t tell us what happens to the phase of the wave function. For a constant Hamiltonian it would pick up the standard “wiggle factor” e−iEnt//planckover2pi1, but the eigenvalue Enmay now itself be a function of time, so the wiggle factor naturally generalizes to eiθn(t),whereθn(t)≡−1 /planckover2pi1/integraldisplayt 0En/parenleftbig t/prime/parenrightbig dt/prime. (11.92) This is called the dynamic phase . But it may not be the end of the story; for all we know there may be an additional phase factor, γn(t), the so-called geometric phase . In the adiabatic limit, then, the wave function at time ttakes the form34 /Psi1n(t)=eiθn(t)eiγn(t)ψn(t), (11.93) 34I’m suppressing the dependence on other variables; only the time dependence is at issue here.430 CHAPTER 11 Quantum Dynamics whereψn(t)is the nth eigenstate of the instantaneous Hamiltonian, ˆH(t)ψn(t)=En(t)ψn(t). (11.94) Equation 11.93 is the formal statement of the adiabatic theorem. Of course, the phase of ψn(t)is itself arbitrary (it’s still an eigenfunction, with the same eigenvalue, whatever phase you choose), so the geometric phase itself carries no physical sig- niﬁcance. But what if we carry the system around a closed cycle (like the pendulum we hauled down to the equator, around, and back to the north pole), so that the Hamiltonian at the end is identical to the Hamiltonian at the beginning? Then the netphase change is a measurable quantity. The dynamic phase depends on the elapsed time, but the geometric phase, around an adiabatic closed cycle, depends only on the path taken.35It is called Berry’s phase :36 γB≡γ(T)−γ(0). (11.95) Example 11.4 Imagine an electron (charge −e,m a s s m)at rest at the origin, in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld whose magnitude(B0)is constant, but whose direction sweeps out a cone, of opening angleα, at constant angular velocity ω(Figure 11.16 ): xyω α –eBz Figure 11.16: The magnetic ﬁeld sweeps around in a cone, at angular velocity ω(Equation 11.96 ).

Problem 11.19 A particle is in the ground state of the harmonic oscillator with classical frequencyω, when suddenly the spring constant quadruples, so ω/prime=2ω, without initially changing the wave function (of course, /Psi1will now evolve differently, because the Hamil- tonian has changed).

Also conﬁrm Equation 11.105 , and show that the sum of the squares of the coefﬁcients is 1, as required for normalization.Further Problems on Chapter 11 433 ∗ Problem 11.21 Find Berry’s phase for one cycle of the process in Example 11.4.Hint: Use Equation 11.105 to determine the total phase change, and subtract off the dynamical part. You’ll need to expand λ(Equation 11.104 ) to ﬁrst order in ω/ω 1. Problem 11.22 The delta function well (Equation 2.117 ) supports a single bound state (Equation 2.132 ). Calculate the geometric phase change when αgradually increases from α1toα2. If the increase occurs at a constant rate (dα/dt=c), what is the dynamic phase change for this process?37 FURTHER PROBLEMS ON CHAPTER 11 ∗∗∗ Problem 11.23 In Problem 11.1 you showed that the solution to df dt=k(t)f(t) (where k(t)is a function of t)is f(t)=eK(t)f(0),where K(t)≡/integraldisplayt 0k/parenleftbig t/prime/parenrightbig dt/prime. This suggests that the solution to the Schrödinger equation ( 11.1) might be /Psi1(t)=eˆG(t)/Psi1(0),whereˆG(t)≡−i /planckover2pi1/integraldisplayt 0ˆH/parenleftbig t/prime/parenrightbig dt/prime. (11.108) It doesn’t work, because ˆH(t)is an operator , not a function, and ˆH(t1)does not (in general) commute with ˆH(t2).

You might try to beat the rap by tacking an unnecessary (but perfectly legal) phase factor onto the eigenfunctions: ψ/primen(t)≡eiφnψn(t),w h e r eφnis an arbitrary (real) function. Try it. You’ll get a nonzero geometric phase, all right, but note what happens when you put it back into Equation 11.93 . And for a closed loop it gives zero.434 CHAPTER 11 Quantum Dynamics UGLY! Notice that the operators in each term are “time-ordered,” in the sense that the latestˆHappears at the far left, followed by the next latest, and so on(t≥t1≥t2≥t3···).

(11.112) This is Dyson’s formula ; it’s a compact way of writing Equation 11.109 ,t h ef o r - mal solution to Schrödinger’s equation. Dyson’s formula plays a fundamental role in quantum ﬁeld theory.38 ∗∗ Problem 11.24 In this problem we develop time-dependent perturbation theory for a multi- level system, starting with the generalization of Equations 11.5 and11.6: ˆH0ψn=Enψn,/angbracketleftψn|ψm/angbracketright=δnm. (11.113) At time t=0 we turn on a perturbation H/prime(t), so that the total Hamiltonian is ˆH=ˆH0+ˆH/prime(t). (11.114) 38The interaction picture is intermediate between the Heisenberg and Schrödinger pictures (see Section 6.8.1 ). In the interaction picture, the wave function satisﬁes the “Schrödinger equation” i/planckover2pi1d dt|/Psi1I(t)/angbracketright=ˆH/prime I(t)|/Psi1I(t)/angbracketright, where the interaction- and Schrödinger-picture operators are related by ˆH/prime I(t)=eiˆH0t//planckover2pi1ˆH/prime(t)e−iˆH0t//planckover2pi1 and the wave functions satisfy |/Psi1I(t)/angbracketright=eiˆH0t//planckover2pi1|/Psi1(t)/angbracketright. If you apply the Dyson series to the Schrödinger equation in the interaction picture, you end up with precisely the perturbation series derived in Section 11.1.2 .

(a)Solve for the exact c m(t), using Equation 11.116 , and show that the wave function changes phase , but no transitions occur. Find the phase change, φ(T), in terms of the function V0(t). (b)Analyze the same problem in ﬁrst-order perturbation theory, and compare your answers. Comment : The same result holds whenever the perturbation simply adds a con- stant (constant in x, that is, not in t)to the potential; it has nothing to do with the inﬁnite square well, as such.

An electromagnetic wave can be described by the potentials A=E0 ωsin(k·r−ωt),ϕ=0 where in order to satisfy Maxwell’s equations, the wave must be transverse (E0·k=0)and of course travel at the speed of light (ω=c|k|).

The true electric ﬁeld would be E(r,t)=E0cos(k·r−ωt). (11.128) If the atom is centered at the origin, then k·r/lessmuch1 over the relevant volume (|k|=2π/λ,s ok·r∼r/λ/lessmuch1), and that’s why we could afford to drop this term. Suppose we keep the ﬁrst-order correction: E(r,t)=E0[cos(ωt)+(k·r)sin(ωt)]. (11.129) The ﬁrst term gives rise to the allowed (electric dipole ) transitions we considered in the text; the second leads to so-called forbidden (magnetic dipole and elec- tric quadrupole ) transitions (higher powers of k·rlead to even more “forbidden” transitions, associated with higher multipole moments).39 (a)Obtain the spontaneous emission rate for forbidden transitions (don’t bother to average over polarization and propagation directions, though this should really be done to complete the calculation).

Problem 11.37 Quantum Zeno Paradox.47Suppose a system starts out in an excited state ψb, which has a natural lifetime τfor transition to the ground state ψa. Ordinarily, for times substantially less than τ, the probability of a transition is proportional to t (Equation 11.49 ): Pb→a=t τ. (11.145) If we make a measurement after a time t, then, the probability that the system is still in the upper state is Pb(t)=1−t τ. (11.146) Suppose we doﬁnd it to be in the upper state. In that case the wave function collapses back toψb, and the process starts all over again. If we make a second measurement, at 2t, the probability that the system is stillin the upper state is /parenleftbigg 1−t τ/parenrightbigg2 ≈1−2t τ, (11.147) which is the same as it would have been had we never made the ﬁrst measurement at t(as one would naively expect). However, for extremely short times, the probability of a transition is notproportional tot, but rather to t2(Equation 11.46 ):48 Pb→a=αt2. (11.148) 47This phenomenon doesn’t have much to do with Zeno, but it isreminiscent of the old adage, “a watched pot never boils,” so it is sometimes called the watched pot effect . 48In the argument leading to linear time dependence, we assumed that the function sin2(/Omega1t/2)//Omega12in Equation 11.46 was a sharp spike. However, the width of the “spike” is of order /Delta1ω=4π/t,a n df o r extremely short tthis assumption fails, and the integral becomes/parenleftBig t2/4/parenrightBig/integraltext ρ(ω)dω.Further Problems on Chapter 11 443 (a)In this case what is the probability that the system is still in the upper state after the two measurements? What would it have been (after the same elapsed time) if we had never made the ﬁrst measurement? (b)Suppose we examine the system at nregular (extremely short) intervals, from t=0 out to t=T(that is, we make measurements at T/n,2T/n,3T/n,..., T). What is the probability that the system is still in the upper state at time T? What is its limit as n→∞ ?Moral of the story: Because of the collapse of the wave function at every measurement, a continuously observed system never decays at all!49 ∗∗∗ Problem 11.38 The numerical solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation in Problem 2.61 can be extended to solve the time- dependent Schrödinger equation. When we discretize the variable x, we obtain the matrix equation H/Psi1=i/planckover2pi1d dt/Psi1. (11.149) The solution to this equation can be written /Psi1(t+/Delta1t)=U(/Delta1t)/Psi1(t). (11.150) IfHis time independent, the exact expression for the time-evolution operator is50 U(/Delta1t)=e−iH/Delta1t//planckover2pi1(11.151) and for/Delta1tsmall enough, the time-evolution operator can be approximated as U(/Delta1t)≈1−iH/Delta1t /planckover2pi1. (11.152) While Equation 11.152 is the most obvious way to approximate U, a numerical scheme based on it is unstable, and it is preferable to use Cayley’s form for the approximation:51 U(/Delta1t)≈1−1 2i/Delta1t /planckover2pi1H 1+1 2i/Delta1t /planckover2pi1H. (11.153) Combining Equations 11.153 and11.150 we have /parenleftbigg 1+1 2i/Delta1t /planckover2pi1H/parenrightbigg /Psi1(t+/Delta1t)=/parenleftbigg 1−1 2i/Delta1t /planckover2pi1H/parenrightbigg /Psi1(t). (11.154) 49This argument was introduced by B. Misra and E. C. G. Sudarshan, J. Math. Phys. 18, 756 (1977). The essential result has been conﬁrmed in the laboratory: W. M. Itano, D. J. Heinzen, J. J. Bollinger, and D. J. Wineland, P h y s .R e v .A 41, 2295 (1990). Unfortunately, the experiment is not as compelling a test of the collapse of the wave function as its designers hoped, for the observed effect can perhaps be accounted for in other ways—see L. E. Ballentine, Found. Phys. 20, 1329 (1990); T. Petrosky, S. Tasaki, and I. Prigogine, Phys. Lett. A 151, 109 (1990). 50If you choose/Delta1tsmall enough, you can actually use this exact form. Routines such as Mathematica’s MatrixExp can be used to ﬁnd (numerically) the exponential of a matrix. 51See A. Goldberg et al. ,A m .J .P h y s . 35, 177 (1967) for further discussion of these approximations.444 CHAPTER 11 Quantum Dynamics This has the form of a matrix equation Mx=bwhich can be solved for the unknown x=/Psi1(t+/Delta1t). Because the matrix M=1+1 2i/Delta1t /planckover2pi1Histri-diagonal ,52efﬁcient algorithms exist for doing so.53 (a)Show that the approximation in Equation 11.153 is accurate to second order. That is, show that Equations 11.151 and11.153 , expanded as power series in /Delta1t, agree up through terms of order (/Delta1t)2. Verify that the matrix in Equation 11.153 is unitary. As an example, consider a particle of mass mmoving in one dimension in a simple harmonic oscillator potential. For the numerical part set m=1,ω=1, and /planckover2pi1=1 (this just deﬁnes the units of mass, time, and length). (b)Construct the Hamiltonian matrix HforN+1=100 spatial grid points. Set the spatial boundaries where the dimensionless length is ξ=±10 (far enough out that we can assume that the wave function vanishes there for low-energy states). By computer, ﬁnd the lowest two eigenvalues of H, and compare the exact values. Plot the corresponding eigenfunctions. Are they normalized? If not, normalize them before doing part (c). (c)Take/Psi1(0)=(ψ0+ψ1)/√ 2 (from part (b)) and use Equation 11.154 to evolve the wave function from time t=0t o t=4π/ω. Create a movie ( Animate ,i n Mathematica) showing Re (/Psi1(t)),I m(/Psi1(t)), and|/Psi1(t)|, together with the exact result. Hint: You need to decide what to use for /Delta1t. In terms of the number of time steps Nt,Nt/Delta1t=4π/ω. In order for the approximation of the expo- nential to hold, we need to have E/Delta1t//planckover2pi1/lessmuch1. The energy of our state is of order /planckover2pi1ω, and therefore Nt/greatermuch4π. So you will need at least (say) 100 time steps. ∗∗∗ Problem 11.39 We can use the technique of Problem 11.38 to investigate time evolution when the Hamiltonian does depend on time, as long as we choose /Delta1tsmall enough. Evaluating Hat the midpoint of each time step we simply replace Equation 11.154 with54 /bracketleftbigg 1+1 2i/Delta1t /planckover2pi1H/parenleftbigg t+/Delta1t 2/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg /Psi1(t+/Delta1t)=/bracketleftbigg 1−1 2i/Delta1t /planckover2pi1H/parenleftbigg t+/Delta1t 2/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg /Psi1(t). (11.155) Consider the driven harmonic oscillator of Problem 11.36 with f(t)=Asin(/Omega1t), (11.156) where Ais a constant with the units of length and /Omega1is the driving frequency. In the following we will set m=ω=/planckover2pi1=A=1 and look at the effect of varying /Omega1. Use the same parameters for the spatial discretization as in Problem 11.38 ,b u ts e t 52A tri-diagonal matrix has nonzero entries only along the diagonal and one space to the right or left of the diagonal. 53Use your computing enviroment’s built-in linear equation solver; in Mathematica that would be x=L i n e a r - Solve[M, b] .

For a particle that starts off in the ground state at t=0, create a movie showing the numerical and exact solutions as well as the instantaneous ground state from t=0t ot=2π//Omega1 for (a)/Omega1=ω/5. In line with the adiabatic theorem, you should see that the numerical solution is close (up to a phase) to the instantaneous ground state. (b)/Omega1=5ω. In line with what you’ve learned about sudden perturbations, you should see that the numerical solution is barely affected by the driving force. (c)/Omega1=6ω/5.12AFTERWORD Now that you have a sound understanding of what quantum mechanics says, I would like to return to the question of what it means —continuing the story begun in Section 1.2. The source of the problem is the indeterminacy associated with the statistical interpretation of the wave function. For/Psi1(or, more generally, the quantum state —it could be a spinor, for example) does not uniquely determine the outcome of a measurement; all it tells us is the statistical distribution of possible results. This raises a profound question: Did the physical system “actually have” the attribute in question prior to the measurement (the so-called realist viewpoint), or did the act of measurement itself “create” the property, limited only by the statistical constraint imposed by the wave function (the orthodox position)—or can we duck the issue entirely, on the grounds that it is “metaphysical” (the agnostic response)? According to the realist, quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory, for even if you know everything quantum mechanics has to tell you about the system (to wit: its wave function), still you cannot determine all of its features. Evidently there is some other information, unknown to quantum mechanics, which (together with /Psi1) is required for a complete description of physical reality. The orthodox position raises even more disturbing problems, for if the act of measurement forces the system to “take a stand,” helping to create an attribute that was not there previously,1 then there is something very peculiar about the measurement process. Moreover, in order to account for the fact that an immediately repeated measurement yields the same result, we are forced to assume that the act of measurement collapses the wave function, in a manner that is difﬁcult, at best, to reconcile with the normal evolution prescribed by the Schrödinger equation. In light of this, it is no wonder that generations of physicists retreated to the agnostic posi- tion, and advised their students not to waste time worrying about the conceptual foundations of the theory. 1This may be strange , but it is not mystical , as some popularizers would like to suggest. The so-called wave–particle duality , which Niels Bohr elevated to the status of a cosmic principle ( complementarity ), makes electrons sound like unpredictable adolescents, who sometimes behave like adults, and sometimes, for no particular reason, like children. I prefer to avoid such language. When I say that a particle does not have a particular attribute before its measurement, I have in mind, for example, an electron in the spin state χ=/parenleftbigg1 0/parenrightbigg ; a measurement of the x- component of its angular momentum could return the value /planckover2pi1/2, or (with equal probability) the value −/planckover2pi1/2, but until the measurement is made it simply does not have a well-deﬁned value of Sx.12.1 The EPR Paradox 447 12.1 THE EPR PARADOX In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen2published the famous EPR paradox , which was designed to prove (on purely theoretical grounds) that the realist position is the only tenable one. I’ll describe a simpliﬁed version of the EPR paradox, due to David Bohm (call it EPRB). Consider the decay of the neutral pi meson into an electron and a positron: π0→e−+e+. Assuming the pion was at rest, the electron and positron ﬂy off in opposite directions (Fig- ure12.1). Now, the pion has spin zero, so conservation of angular momentum requires that the electron and positron occupy the singlet spin conﬁguration: 1√ 2(|↑↓/angbracketright−|↓↑/angbracketright). (12.1) If the electron is found to have spin up, the positron must have spin down, and vice versa. Quantum mechanics can’t tell you which combination you’ll get, in any particular pion decay, but it does say that the measurements will be correlated , and you’ll get each combination half the time (on average). Now suppose we let the electron and positron ﬂy faroff—10 meters, in a practical experiment, or, in principle, 10 light years—and then you measure the spin of the electron. Say you get spin up. Immediately you know that someone 20 meters (or 20 light years) away will get spin down, if that person examines the positron. To the realist, there’s nothing surprising about this—the electron really had spin up (and the positron spin down) from the moment they were created . . . it’s just that quantum mechanics didn’t know about it. But the “orthodox” view holds that neither particle had either spin up orspin down until the act of measurement intervened: Your measurement of the electron col- lapsed the wave function, and instantaneously “produced” the spin of the positron 20 meters (or 20 light years) away. Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen considered such “spooky action-at-a- distance” (Einstein’s delightful term) preposterous. They concluded that the orthodox position is untenable; the electron and positron must have had well-deﬁned spins all along, whether quantum mechanics knows it or not. The fundamental assumption on which the EPR argument rests is that no inﬂuence can propagate faster than the speed of light. We call this the principle of locality . You might be tempted to propose that the collapse of the wave function is notinstantaneous, but “travels” at some ﬁnite velocity. However, this would lead to violations of angular momen- tum conservation, for if we measured the spin of the positron before the news of the collapse had reached it, there would be a ﬁfty–ﬁfty probability of ﬁnding both particles with spin up. Whatever you might think of such a theory in the abstract, the experi- ments are unequivocal: No such violation occurs—the (anti-)correlation of the spins is e−e+ π0 Figure 12.1: Bohm’s version of the EPR experiment: A π0at rest decays into an electron–positron pair. 2A. Einstein, B. Podolsky, and N. Rosen, Phys. Rev. 47, 777 (1935).448 CHAPTER 12 Afterword perfect. Evidently the collapse of the wave function—whatever its ontological status—is instantaneous.3 Problem 12.1 Entangled states. The singlet spin conﬁguration (Equation 12.1) is the clas- sic example of an entangled state —a two-particle state that cannot be expressed as the product of two one-particle states, and for which, therefore, one cannot really speak of “the state” of either particle separately.4You might wonder whether this is somehow an artifact of bad notation—maybe some linear combination of the one-particle states would disentangle the system. Prove the following theorem: Consider a two-level system, |φa/angbracketrightand|φb/angbracketright, with/angbracketleftbig φi|φj/angbracketrightbig =δij.( F o r example,|φa/angbracketrightmight represent spin up and |φb/angbracketrightspin down.) The two-particle state α|φa(1)/angbracketright|φb(2)/angbracketright+β|φb(1)/angbracketright|φa(2)/angbracketright (withα/negationslash=0 andβ/negationslash=0)cannot be expressed as a product |ψr(1)/angbracketright|ψs(2)/angbracketright, foranyone-particle states |ψr/angbracketrightand|ψs/angbracketright. Hint: Write|ψr/angbracketrightand|ψs/angbracketrightas linear combinations of |φa/angbracketrightand|φb/angbracketright. Problem 12.2 Einstein’s Boxes. In an interesting precursor to the EPR paradox, Einstein proposed the following gedanken experiment:5Imagine a particle conﬁned to a box (make it a one-dimensional inﬁnite square well, if you like). It’s in the ground state, when an impenetrable partition is introduced, dividing the box into separate halves, B1andB2,i n such a way that the particle is equally likely to be found in either one.6Now the two boxes are moved very far apart, and a measurement is made on B1to see if the particle is in that box. Suppose the answer is yes. Immediately we know that the particle will notbe found in the (distant) box B2. (a)What would Einstein say about this? (b)How does the Copenhagen interpretation account for it? What is the wave function inB2, right after the measurement on B1? 3Bohr wrote a famous rebuttal to the EPR paradox ( Phys. Rev. 48, 696 (1935)). I doubt many people read it, and certainly very few understood it (Bohr himself later admitted that he had trouble making sense of his own argument), but it was a relief that the great man had solved the problem, and everybody else could go back to business. It was not until the mid-1960s that most physicists began to worry seriously about the EPR paradox. 4Although the term “entanglement” is usually applied to systems of two (or more) particles, the same basic notion can be extended to single particle states (Problem 12.2 is an example). For an interesting discussion see D. V . Schroeder, A m .J .P h y s . 85, 812 (2017). 5See T. Norsen, Am. J. Phys. 73, 164 (2005). 6The partition is inserted rapidly; if it is done adiabatically the particle may be forced into the (however slightly) larger of the two, as you found in Problem 11.34 .12.2 Bell’s Theorem 449 12.2 BELL’S THEOREM Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen did not doubt that quantum mechanics is correct , as far as it goes; they only claimed that it is an incomplete description of physical reality: The wave func- tion is not the whole story—some other quantity,λ, is needed, in addition to /Psi1, to characterize the state of a system fully. We call λthe “hidden variable” because, at this stage, we have no idea how to calculate or measure it.7Over the years, a number of hidden variable theo- ries have been proposed, to supplement quantum mechanics;8they tend to be cumbersome and implausible, but never mind—until 1964 the program seemed eminently worth pursuing. But in that year J. S. Bell proved that anylocal hidden variable theory is incompatible with quantum mechanics.9 Bell suggested a generalization of the EPRB experiment: Instead of orienting the electron and positron detectors along the same direction, he allowed them to be rotated independently. The ﬁrst measures the component of the electron spin in the direction of a unit vector a, and the second measures the spin of the positron along the direction b(Figure 12.2). For simplicity, let’s record the spins in units of /planckover2pi1/2; then each detector registers the value +1 (for spin up) or −1 (spin down), along the direction in question. A table of results, for many π0decays, might look like this: electron positron product +1−1−1 +1+1+1 −1+1−1 +1−1−1 −1−1+1 ......... Bell proposed to calculate the average value of the product of the spins, for a given set of detector orientations. Call this average P(a,b). If the detectors are parallel (b=a),w e recover the original EPRB conﬁguration; in this case one is spin up and the other spin down, so the product is always −1, and hence so too is the average: e−e+ π0b a Figure 12.2: Bell’s version of the EPRB experiment: detectors independently oriented in directions a andb. 7The hidden variable could be a single number, or it could be a whole collection of numbers; perhaps λis to be calculated in some future theory, or maybe it is for some reason of principle incalculable. It hardly matters. All I am asserting is that there must be something —if only a listof the outcomes of every possible experiment—associated with the system prior to a measurement. 8D. Bohm, Phys. Rev. 85, 166, 180 (1952). 9Bell’s original paper ( Physics 1, 195 (1964), reprinted as Chapter 2in John S. Bell, Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics , Cambridge University Press, UK (1987)) is a gem: brief, accessible, and beautifully written.450 CHAPTER 12 Afterword P(a,a)=−1. (12.2) By the same token, if they are anti-parallel(b=− a), then every product is +1, so P(a,−a)=+1. (12.3) For arbitrary orientations, quantum mechanics predicts P(a,b)=− a·b (12.4) (see Problem 4.59). What Bell discovered is that this result is incompatible with any local hidden variable theory . The argument is stunningly simple. Suppose that the “complete” state of the electron– positron system is characterized by the hidden variable(s) λ(λ varies, in some way that we neither understand nor control, from one pion decay to the next). Suppose further that the outcome of the electron measurement is independent of the orientation ( b)o ft h e positron detector—which may, after all, be chosen by the experimenter at the positron end just before the electron measurement is made, and hence far too late for any subluminal message to get back to the electron detector. (This is the locality assumption.) Then there exists some func- tion A(a,λ)which determines the result of an electron measurement, and some other function B(b,λ)for the positron measurement. These functions can only take on the values ±1:10 A(a,λ)=±1;B(b,λ)=±1. (12.5) When the detectors are aligned, the results are perfectly (anti)-correlated: A(a,λ)=− B(a,λ), (12.6) regardless of the value of λ. Now, the average of the product of the measurements is P(a,b)=/integraldisplay ρ(λ)A(a,λ)B(b,λ)dλ, (12.7) whereρ(λ)is the probability density for the hidden variable. (Like any probability density, it is real, nonnegative, and satisﬁes the normalization condition/integraltext ρ(λ)dλ=1, but beyond this we make no assumptions about ρ(λ); different hidden variable theories would presumably deliver quite different expressions for ρ.) In view of Equation 12.6, we can eliminate B: P(a,b)=−/integraldisplay ρ(λ)A(a,λ)A(b,λ)dλ. (12.8) Ifcis any other unit vector, P(a,b)−P(a,c)=−/integraldisplay ρ(λ)/bracketleftbig A(a,λ)A(b,λ)−A(a,λ)A(c,λ)/bracketrightbig dλ. (12.9) 10This already concedes far more than a classical determinist would be prepared to allow, for it abandons any notion that the particles could have well-deﬁned angular momentum vectors with simultaneously determinate components. The point of Bell’s argument is to demonstrate that quantum mechanics is incompatible with anylocal deterministic theory—even one that bends over backwards to be accommodating. Of course, if you reject Equation 12.5,t h e n the theory is manifestly incompatible with quantum mechanics.12.2 Bell’s Theorem 451 Or, since [A(b,λ)]2=1: P(a,b)−P(a,c)=−/integraldisplay ρ(λ)/bracketleftbig 1−A(b,λ)A(c,λ)/bracketrightbig A(a,λ)A(b,λ)dλ. (12.10) But it follows from Equation 12.5 that|A(a,λ)A(b,λ)|= 1; moreoverρ(λ)[1− A(b,λ)A(c,λ)]≥0, so |P(a,b)−P(a,c)|≤/integraldisplay ρ(λ)/bracketleftbig 1−A(b,λ)A(c,λ)/bracketrightbig dλ, (12.11) or, more simply: |P(a,b)−P(a,c)|≤1+P(b,c). (12.12) This is the famous Bell inequality . It holds for anylocal hidden variable theory (subject only to the minimal requirements of Equations 12.5 and12.6), for we have made no assumptions whatever as to the nature or number of the hidden variable(s), or their distribution (ρ). But it is easy to show that the quantum mechanical prediction (Equation 12.4) is incompat- ible with Bell’s inequality. For example, suppose the three vectors lie in a plane, and cmakes a4 5◦angle with aandb(Figure 12.3); in this case quantum mechanics says P(a,b)=0,P(a,c)=P(b,c)=−0.707, which is patently inconsistent with Bell’s inequality: 0.707/negationslash≤1−0.707=0.293. With Bell’s modiﬁcation, then, the EPR paradox proves something far more radical than its authors imagined: If they are right, then not only is quantum mechanics incomplete ,i ti sd o w n - right wrong . On the other hand, if quantum mechanics is right, then nohidden variable theory is going to rescue us from the nonlocality Einstein considered so preposterous. Moreover, we are provided with a very simple experiment to settle the issue once and for all.11 Many experiments to test Bell’s inequality were performed in the 1960s and 1970s, culmi- nating in the work of Aspect, Grangier, and Roger.12The details do not concern us here (they b c a45° 45° Figure 12.3: An orientation of the detectors that demonstrates quantum violations of Bell’s inequality. 11It is an embarrassing historical fact that Bell’s theorem, which is now universally recognized as one of the most profound discoveries of the twentieth century, was barely noticed at the time, with the exception of an inspired fringe element. For a fascinating account, see David Kaiser, How the Hippies Saved Physics , W. W. Norton, New York, 2011. 12A. Aspect, P. Grangier, and G. Roger, Phys. Rev. Lett. 49, 91 (1982). There were logically possible (if implausible) loopholes in the Aspect experiment, which were gradually closed over the ensuing years; see J. Handsteiner et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 060401 (2017). It is now possible to test Bell’s inequality in the undergraduate laboratory: D. Dehlinger and M. W. Mitchell, A m .J .P h y s . 70, 903 (2002).452 CHAPTER 12 Afterword actually used two-photon atomic transitions, not pion decays). To exclude the remote possibil- ity that the positron detector might somehow “sense” the orientation of the electron detector, both orientations were set quasi-randomly after the photons were already in ﬂight. The results were in excellent agreement with the predictions of quantum mechanics, and inconsitent with Bell’s inequality by a wide margin.13 Ironically, the experimental conﬁrmation of quantum mechanics came as something of a shock to the scientiﬁc community. But not because it spelled the demise of “realism”—most physicists had long since adjusted to this (and for those who could not, there remained the possibility of nonlocal hidden variable theories, to which Bell’s theorem does not apply).14 The real shock was the demonstration that nature itself is fundamentally nonlocal . Nonlocal- ity, in the form of the instantaneous collapse of the wave function (and for that matter also in the symmetrization requirement for identical particles) had always been a feature of the orthodox interpretation, but before Aspect’s experiment it was possible to hope that quantum nonlocality was somehow a nonphysical artifact of the formalism, with no detectable conse- quences. That hope can no longer be sustained, and we are obliged to reexamine our objection to instantaneous action-at-a-distance. Why arephysicists so squeamish about superluminal inﬂuences? After all, there are many things that travel faster than light. If a bug ﬂies across the beam of a movie projector, the speed of its shadow is proportional to the distance to the screen; in principle, that distance can be as large as you like, and hence the shadow can move at arbitrarily high velocity (Figure 12.4). However, the shadow does not carry any energy , nor can it transmit any information from one point on the screen to another. A person at point Xcannot cause anything to happen at point Yby manipulating the passing shadow. On the other hand, a causal inﬂuence that propagated faster than light would carry unacceptable implications. For according to special relativity there exist inertial frames in which such a signal propagates backward in time —the effect preceding the cause—and this leads to inescapable logical anomalies. (You could, for example, arrange to kill your infant grandfather. Think about it . . . not a good idea.) The question is, are the superlumi- nal inﬂuences predicted by quantum mechanics and detected by Aspect causal , in this sense, or are they somehow ethereal enough (like the bug’s shadow) to escape the philosophical objection? 13Bell’s theorem involves averages and it is conceivable that an apparatus such as Aspect’s contains some secret bias which selects out a nonrepresentative sample, thus distorting the average. In 1989, an improved version of Bell’s theorem was proposed, in which the contrast between the quantum prediction and that of any local hid- den variable theory is even more dramatic. See D. Greenberger, M. Horne, A. Shimony, and A. Zeilinger, Am. J. Phys. 58, 1131 (1990) and N. D. Mermin, Am. J. Phys. 58, 731, (1990). An experiment of this kind suit- able for an undergraduate laboratory has been carried out by Mark Beck and his students: Am. J. Phys. 74, 180 (2006). 14It is a curious twist of fate that the EPR paradox, which assumed locality in order to prove realism, led ﬁnally to the demise of locality and left the issue of realism undecided—the outcome (as Bell put it) Einstein would have liked least. Most physicists today consider that if they can’t have local realism, there’s not much point in realism at all, and for this reason nonlocal hidden variable theories occupy a rather peripheral niche. Still, some authors—notably Bell himself, in Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics (footnote 9 in this chapter)—argue that such theories offer the best hope of bridging the conceptual gap between the measured system and the measuring apparatus, and for supplying an intelligible mechanism for the collapse of the wave function.12.2 Bell’s Theorem 453 Projector Bugυ Screenυ´Y X Figure 12.4: The shadow of the bug moves across the screen at a velocity v/primegreater than c, provided the screen is far enough away. Well, let’s consider Bell’s experiment. Does the measurement of the electron inﬂuence the outcome of the positron measurement? Assuredly it does—otherwise we cannot account for the correlations in the data. But does the measurement of the electron cause a particular out- come for the positron? Not in any ordinary sense of the word. There is no way the person manning the electron detector could use his measurement to send a signal to the person at the positron detector, since he does not control the outcome of his own measurement (he cannot make a given electron come out spin up, any more than the person at Xcan affect the passing shadow of the bug). It is true that he can decide whether to make a measure- ment at all , but the positron monitor, having immediate access only to data at his end of the line, cannot tell whether the electron has been measured or not. The lists of data com- piled at the two ends, considered separately, are completely random. It is only later, when wecompare the two lists, that we discover the remarkable correlations. In another reference frame the positron measurements occur before the electron measurements, and yet this leads to no logical paradox—the observed correlation is entirely symmetrical in its treatment, and it is a matter of indifference whether we say the observation of the electron inﬂuenced the measurement of the positron, or the other way around. This is a wonderfully delicate kind of inﬂuence, whose only manifestation is a subtle correlation between two lists of otherwise random data. We are led, then, to distinguish two types of inﬂuence: the “causal” variety, which produce actual changes in some physical property of the receiver, detectable by measurements on that subsystem alone, and an “ethereal” kind, which do not transmit energy or information, and for which the only evidence is a correlation in the data taken on the two separate subsystems— a correlation which by its nature cannot be detected by examining either list alone. Causal inﬂuences cannot propagate faster than light, but there is no compelling reason why ethereal ones should not. The inﬂuences associated with the collapse of the wave function are of the latter type, and the fact that they “travel” faster than light may be surprising, but it is not, after all, catastrophic.15 15An enormous amount has been written about Bell’s theorem. My favorite is an inspired essay by David Mermin in Physics Today (April 1985, page 38). An extensive bibliography will be found in L. E. Ballentine, Am. J. Phys. 55, 785 (1987).454 CHAPTER 12 Afterword ∗∗ Problem 12.3 One example16of a (local) deterministic (“hidden variable”) theory is ...c l a s s i c a lm echanics! Suppose we carried out the Bell experiment with classical objects (baseballs, say) in place of the electron and proton. They are launched (by a kind of double pitching machine) in opposite directions, with equal and opposite spins (angular momenta), SaandSb=− Sa.N o w ,t h e s ea r e classical objects—their angular momenta can point in any direction, and this direction is set (let’s say randomly) at the moment of launch. Detectors placed 10 meters or so on either side of the launch point measure the spin vectors of their respective baseballs. However, in order to match the conditions for Bell’s theorem, they only record thesign of the component ofSalong the directions a andb: A≡sign(a·Sa),B≡sign(b·Sb). Thus each detector records either +1o r−1, in any given trial. In this example the “hidden variable” is the actual orientation of Sa, speciﬁed (say) by the polar and azimuthal angles θandφ:λ=(θ,φ): abθ φ ηS xyz Figure 12.5: Axes for Problem 12.3. (a)Choosing axes as in the ﬁgure, with aandbin the x–yplane and aalong the xaxis, verify that A(a,λ)B(b,λ)=−sign[cos(φ)cos(φ−η)], whereηis the angle between aandb(take it to run from −πto+π). (b)Assuming the baseballs are launched in such a way that Sais equally likely to point in any direction, compute P(a,b).Answer:(2|η|/π)−1. (c)Sketch the graph of P(a,b),f r o mη=−πto+π, and (on the same graph) the quantum formula (Equation 12.4, withθ→η). For what values of ηdoes this hidden variable theory agree with the quantum-mechanical result? (d)Verify that your result satisﬁes Bell’s inequality, Equation 12.12. Hint: The vectors a,b, and cdeﬁne three points on the surface of a unit sphere; the inequality can be expressed in terms of the distances between those points. 16This problem is based on George Greenstein and Arthur G. Zajonc, The Quantum Challenge , 2nd edn., Jones and Bartlett, Sudbury, MA (2006), Section 5.3.12.3 Mixed States and the Density Matrix 455 12.3 MIXED STATES AND THE DENSITY MATRIX 12.3.1 Pure States In this book we have dealt with particles in pure states ,|/Psi1/angbracketright—a harmonic oscillator in its nth stationary state, for instance, or in a speciﬁc linear combination of stationary states, or a free particle in a gaussian wave packet. The expectation value of some observable Ais then /angbracketleftA/angbracketright=/angbracketleftBig /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆA/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/Psi1/angbracketrightBig ; (12.13) it’s the average of measurements on an ensemble of identically-prepared systems, all of them in the same state |/Psi1/angbracketright. We developed the whole theory in terms of |/Psi1/angbracketright(a vector in Hilbert space, or, in the position basis, the wave function). But there are other ways to formulate the theory, and a particularly useful one starts by deﬁning the density operator ,17 ˆρ≡|/Psi1/angbracketright/angbracketleft/Psi1|. (12.14) With respect to an orthonormal basis/braceleftbig |ej/angbracketright/bracerightbig an operator is represented by a matrix ;t h e ij element of the matrix Arepresenting the operator ˆAis Aij=/angbracketleftBig ei/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆA/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleej/angbracketrightBig . (12.15) In particular, the ijelement of the density matrix ρis ρij=/angbracketleftbig ei/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆρ/vextendsingle/vextendsingleej/angbracketrightbig =/angbracketleftbig ei/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/Psi1/angbracketrightbig/angbracketleftbig /Psi1/vextendsingle/vextendsingleej/angbracketrightbig . (12.16) The density matrix (for pure states) has several interesting properties: ρ2=ρ,(it is idempotent), (12.17) ρ†=ρ,(it is hermitian), (12.18) Tr(ρ)=/summationdisplay iρii=1,(its trace is 1). (12.19) The expectation value of an observable Ais /angbracketleftA/angbracketright=Tr(ρA). (12.20) We could do everything using the density matrix, instead of the wave function, to represent the state of a particle. Example 12.1 In the standard basis e1=/parenleftbigg1 0/parenrightbigg ,e2=/parenleftbigg0 1/parenrightbigg , (12.21) representing spin up and spin down along the zdirection (Equation 4.149 ), construct the density matrix for an electron with spin up along the xdirection. Solution: In this case |/Psi1/angbracketright=/parenleftbigg1/√ 2 1/√ 2/parenrightbigg (12.22) 17It’s actually the “projection operator” onto the state |/Psi1/angbracketright—see Equation 3.91.456 CHAPTER 12 Afterword (Equation 4.151 ). So ρ11=/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbig 10/parenrightbig/parenleftbigg1/√ 2 1/√ 2/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbig 1/√ 21/√ 2/parenrightbig/parenleftbigg1 0/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg =1√ 21√ 2=1 2, ρ12=/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbig 10/parenrightbig/parenleftbigg1/√ 2 1/√ 2/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbig 1/√ 21/√ 2/parenrightbig/parenleftbigg0 1/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg =1√ 21√ 2=1 2, ρ21=/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbig 01/parenrightbig/parenleftbigg1/√ 2 1/√ 2/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbig 1/√ 21/√ 2/parenrightbig/parenleftbigg1 0/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg =1√ 21√ 2=1 2, ρ22=/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbig 01/parenrightbig/parenleftbigg1/√ 2 1/√ 2/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbig 1/√ 21/√ 2/parenrightbig/parenleftbigg0 1/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg =1√ 21√ 2=1 2, and hence ρ=/parenleftbigg1/21/2 1/21/2/parenrightbigg . (12.23) Or, more efﬁciently, ρ=|/Psi1/angbracketright/angbracketleft/Psi1|=/parenleftbigg1/√ 2 1/√ 2/parenrightbigg/parenleftbig 1/√ 21/√ 2/parenrightbig =/parenleftbigg1/21/2 1/21/2/parenrightbigg . (12.24) Note thatρis hermitian, its trace is 1, and ρ2=/parenleftbigg1/21/2 1/21/2/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg1/21/2 1/21/2/parenrightbigg =/parenleftbigg1/21/2 1/21/2/parenrightbigg =ρ. (12.25) Problem 12.4 (a)Prove properties 12.17 ,12.18 ,12.19 , and 12.20 . (b)Show that the time evolution of the density operator is governed by the equation i/planckover2pi1dˆρ dt=/bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆρ/bracketrightBig . (12.26) (This is the Schrödinger equation, expressed in terms of ˆρ.) Problem 12.5 Repeat Example 12.1 for an electron with spin down along the ydirection. 12.3.2 Mixed States In practice it is often the case that we simply don’t know the state of the particle. Suppose, for example, we are interested in an electron emerging from the Stanford Linear Accelerator. It might have spin up (along some chosen direction), or it might have spin down, or it might be in some linear combination of the two—we just don’t know.18We say that the particle is in a mixed state .19 18I’m not talking about any fancy quantum phenomenon (Heisenberg uncertainty or Born indeterminacy, which would apply even if we knew the precise state); I’m talking here about good old-fashioned ignorance . 19Do not confuse a linear combination of two pure states, which itself is still a pure state (the sum of two vectors in Hilbert space is another vector in Hilbert space) with a mixed state, which is not represented by any(single) vector in the Hilbert space.12.3 Mixed States and the Density Matrix 457 How should we describe such a particle? I could simply list the probability ,pk, that it’s in each possible state |/Psi1k/angbracketright. The expectation value of an observable would now be the average of measurements taken over an ensemble of systems that are notidentically prepared (they are notall in the same state); rather, a fraction pkof them is in each (pure) state |/Psi1k/angbracketright: /angbracketleftA/angbracketright=/summationdisplay kpk/angbracketleftBig /Psi1k/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆA/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/Psi1k/angbracketrightBig . (12.27) There’s a slick way to package this information, by generalizing the density operator: ˆρ≡/summationdisplay kpk|/Psi1k/angbracketright/angbracketleft/Psi1k|. (12.28) Again, it becomes a matrix when referred to a particular basis: ρij=/summationdisplay kpk/angbracketleftei|/Psi1k/angbracketright/angbracketleftbig /Psi1k/vextendsingle/vextendsingleej/angbracketrightbig . (12.29) The density matrix encodes all the information available to us about the system. Like any probabilities, 0≤pk≤1 and/summationdisplay kpk=1. (12.30) The density matrix for mixed states retains most of the properties we identiﬁed for pure states: ρ†=ρ, (12.31) Tr(ρ)=1, (12.32) /angbracketleftA/angbracketright=Tr(ρA). (12.33) i/planckover2pi1dˆρ dt=/bracketleftBig ˆH,ˆρ/bracketrightBig ,(ifdpk dt=0 for all k) (12.34) butρis idempotent only if it represents a pure state: ρ2/negationslash=ρ (12.35) (indeed, this is a quick way to test whether the state is pure). Example 12.2 Construct the density matrix for an electron that is either in the spin-up state or the spin- down state (along z), with equal probability. Solution: In this case p1=p2=1/2, so ρ=/summationdisplay kpk|/Psi1k/angbracketright/angbracketleft/Psi1k|=1 2/parenleftbigg1 0/parenrightbigg/parenleftbig 10/parenrightbig +1 2/parenleftbigg0 1/parenrightbigg/parenleftbig 01/parenrightbig =/parenleftbigg1/20 00/parenrightbigg +/parenleftbigg00 01/2/parenrightbigg =/parenleftbigg1/20 01/2/parenrightbigg . (12.36) Note thatρis hermitian, and its trace is 1, but ρ2=/parenleftbigg1/20 01/2/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg1/20 01/2/parenrightbigg =/parenleftbigg1/40 01/4/parenrightbigg /negationslash=ρ; (12.37) this is nota pure state.458 CHAPTER 12 Afterword Problem 12.6 (a)Prove properties 12.31 ,12.32 ,12.33 , and 12.34 . (b)Show that Tr/parenleftbig ρ2/parenrightbig ≤1, and equal to 1 only if ρrepresents a pure state. (c)Show thatρ2=ρif and only ifρrepresents a pure state. Problem 12.7 (a)Construct the density matrix for an electron that is either in the state spin up along x(with probability 1/3) or in the state spin down along y(with probability 2/3). (b)Find/angbracketleftSy/angbracketrightfor the electron in (a). Problem 12.8 (a)Show that the most general density matrix for a spin-1/2 particle can be written in terms of three real numbers (a1,a2,a3): ρ=1 2/parenleftbigg(1+a3)( a1−ia2) (a1+ia2)( 1−a3)/parenrightbigg =1 2(1+a·σ), (12.38) whereσ1,σ2,σ3are the three Pauli matrices. Hint: It has to be hermitian, and its trace must be 1. (b)In the literature, ais known as the Bloch vector . Show thatρrepresents a pure state if and only if |a|=1, and for a mixed state |a|<1.Hint: Use Problem 12.6(c). Thus every density matrix for a spin-1/2 particle corresponds to a point in the Bloch sphere , of radius 1. Points on the surface are pure states, and points inside are mixed states. (c)What is the probability that a measurement of Szwould return the value +/planckover2pi1/2, if the tip of the Bloch vector is at (i) the north pole (a=(0,0,1)), (ii) the center of the sphere(a=(0,0,0)), (iii) the south pole (a=(0,0,−1))? (d)Find the spinor χrepresenting the (pure) state of the system, if the Bloch vector lies on the equator, at azimuthal angle φ. 12.3.3 Subsystems There is another context in which one might invoke the density matrix formalism: an entangled state, such as the singlet spin conﬁguration of an electron/positron pair, 1√ 2(|↑↓/angbracketright−|↓↑/angbracketright). (12.39) Suppose we are interested only in the positron: what is it’s state? I cannot say ...a m e a s u r e - ment could return spin up (ﬁfty–ﬁfty probability) or spin down. This has nothing to do with ignorance ; I know the state of the system precisely. But the subsystem (the positron) by itself does notoccupy a pure state. If I insist on talking about the positron alone, the best I can do is to tell you its density matrix: ρ=/parenleftbigg1/20 01/2/parenrightbigg , (12.40) representing the 50/50 mixture.12.4 The No-Clone Theorem 459 Of course, this is the same as the density matrix representing a positron in a speciﬁc (but unknown) spin state (Example 12.2). I’ll call it a subsystem density matrix, to distinguish it from an ignorance density matrix. The EPRB paradox illustrates the difference. Before the electron spin was measured, the positron (alone) was represented by the “subsystem” density matrix (Equation 12.40 ); when the electron is measured the positron is knocked into a deﬁnite s t a t e ...b u t w e ( a t t h e d i s t a n t p o s i t r o n d e t e c t o r ) don’t know which. The positron is now rep- resented by the “ignorance” density matrix (Equation 12.36 ). But the two density matrices are identical! Our description of the state of the positron has not been altered by the measurement of the electron—all that has changed is our reason for using the density matrix formalism. 12.4 THE NO-CLONE THEOREM Quantum measurements are typically destructive , in the sense that they alter the state of the system measured. This is how the uncertainty principle is enforced in the laboratory. You might wonder why we don’t just make a bunch of identical copies ( clones ) of the original state, and measure them , leaving the system itself unscathed. It can’t be done. Indeed, if you could build a cloning device (a “quantum Xerox machine”), quantum mechanics would be out the window. For example, it would then be possible to send superluminal messages using the EPRB apparatus.20Say the message to be transmitted, from the operator of the electron detector (conventionally “Alice”) to the operator of the positron detector (“Bob”), is either “yes” (“drop the bomb”) or “no.” If the message is to be “yes,” Alice measures Sz(of the electron). Never mind what result she gets—all that matters is that she makes the measurement, for this means that the positron is now in the pure state ↑or↓(never mind which). If she wants to say “no,” she measures Sx, and that means the positron is now in the deﬁnite state ←or→(never mind which). In any case, Bob makes a million clones of the positron, and measures Szon half of them, and Sxon the other half. If the ﬁrst group are all in the same state (all ↑or all↓), then Alice must have measured Sz, and the message is “yes” (the Sxgroup should be a 50/50 mixture). If all the Sxmeasurements yield the same answer (all ←or all→), then Alice must have measured Sx, and the message is “no” (in that case the Szmeasurements should be a 50/50 mixture). It doesn’t work, because you can’t make a quantum Xerox machine, as Wootters, Zurek, and Dieks proved in 1982.21Schematically, we want the machine to take as input a particle in state|ψ/angbracketright(the one to be copied), plus a second particle in state |X/angbracketright(the “blank sheet of paper”), and spit out twoparticles in the state |ψ/angbracketright(original plus copy): |ψ/angbracketright|X/angbracketright→|ψ/angbracketright|ψ/angbracketright. (12.41) Suppose we have made a device that successfully clones the state |ψ1/angbracketright: |ψ1/angbracketright|X/angbracketright→|ψ1/angbracketright|ψ1/angbracketright, (12.42) 20Starting around 1975, members of the so-called “Fundamental Fysiks Group” proposed a series of increasingly ingenious schemes for faster-than-light communication—inspiring in turn a succession of increasingly sophisti- cated rebuttals, culminating in the no-clone theorem, which ﬁnally put a stop to the whole misguided enterprise. For a fascinating account, see Chapter 11of Kaiser’s How the Hippies Saved Physics (footnote 11,p a g e 451). 21W. K. Wootters and W. H. Zurek, Nature 299, 802 (1982); D. Dieks, Phys. Lett. A9 2 , 271 (1982).460 CHAPTER 12 Afterword and also works for state |ψ2/angbracketright: |ψ2/angbracketright|X/angbracketright→|ψ2/angbracketright|ψ2/angbracketright (12.43) (|ψ1/angbracketrightand|ψ2/angbracketrightmight be spin up and spin down, for example, if the particle is an electron). So far, so good. But what happens when we feed in a linear combination |ψ/angbracketright=α|ψ1/angbracketright+β|ψ2/angbracketright? Evidently we get22 |ψ/angbracketright|X/angbracketright→α|ψ1/angbracketright|ψ1/angbracketright+β|ψ2/angbracketright|ψ2/angbracketright, (12.44) which is not at all what we wanted—what we wanted was |ψ/angbracketright|X/angbracketright→|ψ/angbracketright|ψ/angbracketright=[α|ψ1/angbracketright+β|ψ2/angbracketright][α|ψ1/angbracketright+β|ψ2/angbracketright] =α2|ψ1/angbracketright|ψ1/angbracketright+β2|ψ2/angbracketright|ψ2/angbracketright+αβ[|ψ1/angbracketright|ψ2/angbracketright+|ψ2/angbracketright|ψ1/angbracketright]. (12.45) You can make a machine to clone spin-up electrons and spin-down electrons, but it will fail for any nontrivial linear combinations (such as eigenstates of Sx). It’s as though you bought a Xerox machine that copies vertical lines perfectly, and also horizontal lines, but completely distorts diagonals. The no-clone theorem turned out to have an importance well beyond “merely” protecting quantum mechanics from superluminal communication (and hence an inescapable conﬂict with special relativity).23In particular, it opened up the ﬁeld of quantum cryptography , which exploits the theorem to detect eavesdropping.24This time Alice and Bob want to agree on a key for decoding messages, without the cumbersome necessity of actually meeting face-to- face. Alice is to send the key (a string of numbers) to Bob via a stream of carefully prepared photons.25But they are worried that their nemesis, Eve, might try to intercept this communi- cation, and thereby crack the code, without their knowledge. Alice prepares a string of photons in four different states: linearly polarized (horizontal |H/angbracketrightand vertical|V/angbracketright), and circularly polarized (left |L/angbracketrightand right|R/angbracketright), which she sends to Bob. Eve hopes to capture and clone the photons en route, sending the originals along to Bob, who will be none the wiser. (Later on, she knows, Alice and Bob will compare notes on a sample of the photons, to make sure there has been no tampering—that’s why she has to clone them perfectly, to go undetected.) But the no-clone theorem guarantees that Eve’s Xerox machine will fail;26Alice and Bob will catch the eavesdropping when they compare the samples. (They will then, presumably, discard that key.) 22This assumes that the device acts linearly on the state|ψ/angbracketright, as it must, since the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (which presumably governs the process) is linear. 23The no-clone theorem is one of the foundations for quantum information theory ,“teleportation ,” and quantum computation . For a brief history and a comprehensive bibliography, see F. W. Strauch, Am. J. Phys. 84, 495 (2016). 24For a brief summary, see W. K. Wootters and W. H. Zurek, Physics Today , February 2009, page 76. 25Electrons would do, but traditionally the story is told using photons. By the way, there is no entanglement involved, and they’re not in a hurry—this has nothing to do with EPR or superluminal signals. 26If Alice and Bob were foolish enough to use just twoorthogonal photon states (say, |H/angbracketrightand|V/angbracketright), then Eve might get lucky, and use a quantum Xerox machine that does faithfully clone those two states. But as long as they include nontrivial linear combinations (such as |R/angbracketrightand|L/angbracketright), the cloning is certain to fail, and the eavesdropping will be detected.12.5 Schrödinger’s Cat 461 12.5 SCHRÖDINGER’S CAT The measurement process plays a mischievous role in quantum mechanics: It is here that indeterminacy, nonlocality, the collapse of the wave function, and all the attendant concep- tual difﬁculties arise. Absent measurement, the wave function evolves in a leisurely and deterministic way, according to the Schrödinger equation, and quantum mechanics looks like a rather ordinary ﬁeld theory (much simpler than classical electrodynamics, for exam- ple, since there is only one ﬁeld(/Psi1), instead of two (Eand B), and it’s a scalar ). It is the bizarre role of the measurement process that gives quantum mechanics its extraor- dinary richness and subtlety. But what, exactly, isa measurement? What makes it so different from other physical processes?27And how can we tell when a measurement has occurred? Schrödinger posed the essential question most starkly, in his famous cat paradox :28 A cat is placed in a steel chamber, together with the following hellish contraption ....I naG e i g e r counter there is a tiny amount of radioactive substance, so tiny that maybe within an hour one of the atoms decays, but equally probably none of them decays. If one decays then the counter triggers and via a relay activates a little hammer which breaks a container of cyanide. If one has left this entire system for an hour, then one would say the cat is living if no atom has decayed. The ﬁrst decay would have poisoned it. The wave function of the entire system would express this by containing equal parts of the living and dead cat. At the end of the hour, then, the wave function of the cat has the schematic form ψ=1√ 2(ψalive+ψdead). (12.46) The cat is neither alive nor dead, but rather a linear combination of the two, until a measurement occurs—until, say, you peek in the window to check. At that moment your observation forces the cat to “take a stand”: dead or alive. And if you ﬁnd him to be dead, then it’s really youwho killed him, by looking in the window. Schrödinger regarded this as patent nonsense, and I think most people would agree with him. There is something absurd about the very idea of a macroscopic object being in a linear combination of two palpably different states. An electron can be in a linear combination of spin up and spin down, but a cat simply cannot bein a linear combination of alive and dead. But how are we to reconcile this with quantum mechanics? 27There is a school of thought that rejects this distinction, holding that the system and the measuring apparatus should be described by one great big wave function which itself evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. In such theories there is no collapse of the wave function, but one must typically abandon any hope of describing individual events—quantum mechanics (in this view) applies only to ensembles of identically prepared systems. See, for example, Philip Pearle, A m .J .P h y s . 35, 742 (1967), or Leslie E. Ballentine, Quantum Mechanics: A Modern Development , 2nd edn, World Scientiﬁc, Singapore (1998). 28E. Schrödinger, Naturwiss. 48, 52 (1935); translation by Josef M. Jauch, Foundations of Quantum Mechanics , Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1968), page 185.462 CHAPTER 12 Afterword The Schrödinger cat paradox forces us to confront the question “What constitutes a ‘mea- surement,’ in quantum mechanics”? Does the “measurement” really occur when we peek in the keyhole? Or did it happen much earlier, when the atom did (or did not) decay? Or was it when the Geiger counter registered (or did not) the decay, or when the hammer did (or did not) hit the vial of cyanide? Historically, there have been many answers to this question. Wigner held that measurement requires the intervention of human consciousness; Bohr thought it meant the interaction between a microscopic system (subject to the laws of quantum mechanics) and a macroscopic measuring apparatus (described by classical laws); Heisenberg maintained that a measurement occurs when a permanent record is left; others have pointed to the irre- versible nature of a measurement. The embarrassing fact is that none of these characterizations is entirely satisfactory. Most physicists would say that the measurement occurred (and the cat became either alive or dead) well before we looked in the window, but there is no real consensus as to when or why. And this still leaves the deeper question of why a macroscopic system cannot occupy a linear combination of two clearly distinct states—a baseball, say, in a linear combination of Seattle and Toronto. Suppose you could get a baseball into such a state, what would happen to it? In some ultimate sense the macroscopic system must itself be described by the laws of quantum mechanics. But wave functions, in the ﬁrst instance, represent individual elemen- tary particles; the wave function of a macroscopic object would be a monstrously complicated composite structure, built out of the wave functions of its 1023constituent particles. And it is subject to constant bombardment from the environment29—subject, that is, to continuous “measurement” and the attendant collapse. In this process, presumably, “classical” states are statistically favored, and in practice the linear combination devolves almost instantaneously into one of the ordinary conﬁgurations we encounter in everyday life. This phenomenon is called decoherence , and although it is still not entirely understood it appears to be the fun- damental mechanism by which quantum mechanics reduces to classical mechanics in the macroscopic realm.30 •••••• In this book I have tried to tell a consistent and coherent story: The wave function (/Psi1)repre- sents the state of a particle (or system); particles do not in general possess speciﬁc dynamical properties (position, momentum, energy, angular momentum, etc.) until an act of measurement intervenes; the probability of getting a particular value in any given experiment is determined by the statistical interpretation of /Psi1; upon measurement the wave function collapses, so that an immediately repeated measurement is certain to yield the same result. There are other possi- ble interpretations—nonlocal hidden variable theories, the “many worlds” picture, “consistent histories,” ensemble models, and others—but I believe this one is conceptually the simplest , 29This is true even if you put it in an almost complete vacuum, cool it down practically to absolute zero, and somehow shield out the cosmic background radiation. It is possible to imagine a single electron avoiding all contact for a signiﬁcant time, but not a macroscopic object. 30See, for example, M. Schlosshauer, Decoherence and the Quantum-to-Classical Transition , Springer, (2007), or W. H. Zurek, Physics Today , October, 2014, page 44.12.5 Schrödinger’s Cat 463 and certainly it is the one shared by most physicists today.31It has stood the test of time, and emerged unscathed from every experimental challenge. But I cannot believe this is the end of the story; at the very least, we have much to learn about the nature of measurement and the mechanism of collapse. And it is entirely possible that future generations will look back, from the vantage point of a more sophisticated theory, and wonder how we could have been so gullible. 31See Daniel Styer et al. ,Am. J. Phys. 70, 288 (2002).APPENDIX LINEAR ALGEBRA Linear algebra abstracts and generalizes the arithmetic of ordinary vectors, as we encounter them in ﬁrst-year physics. The generalization is in two directions: (1) we allow the scalars to becomplex numbers, and (2) we do not restrict ourselves to three dimensions. A.1 VECTORS Avector space consists of a set of vectors (|α/angbracketright,|β/angbracketright,|γ/angbracketright,...), together with a set of scalars (a, b,c,...),1which is closed2under two operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication. •Vector Addition The “sum” of any two vectors is another vector: |α/angbracketright+|β/angbracketright=|γ/angbracketright. (A.1) Vector addition is commutative : |α/angbracketright+|β/angbracketright=|β/angbracketright+|α/angbracketright, (A.2) andassociative : |α/angbracketright+(|β/angbracketright+|γ/angbracketright)=(|α/angbracketright+|β/angbracketright)+|γ/angbracketright. (A.3) There exists a zero (ornull)vector ,3|0/angbracketright, with the property that |α/angbracketright+|0/angbracketright=|α/angbracketright, (A.4) for every vector |α/angbracketright. And for every vector |α/angbracketrightthere is an associated inverse vector(|−α/angbracketright),4 such that |α/angbracketright+|−α/angbracketright=|0/angbracketright. (A.5) 1For our purposes, the scalars will be ordinary complex numbers. Mathematicians can tell you about vector spaces over more exotic ﬁelds, but such objects play no role in quantum mechanics. Note that α,β,γ...a r e not(ordinarily) numbers; they are names (labels)—“Charlie,” for instance, or “F43A-9GL,” or whatever you care to use to identify the vector in question. 2That is to say, these operations are always well-deﬁned, and will never carry you outside the vector space. 3It is customary, where no confusion can arise, to write the null vector without the adorning bracket: |0/angbracketright→ 0. 4This is funny notation, since αis not a number. I’m simply adopting the name “ −Charlie” for the inverse of the vector whose name is “Charlie.” More natural terminology will suggest itself in a moment.A.1 Vectors 465 •Scalar Multiplication The “product” of any scalar with any vector is another vector: a|α/angbracketright=|γ/angbracketright. (A.6) Scalar multiplication is distributive with respect to vector addition: a(|α/angbracketright+|β/angbracketright)=a|α/angbracketright+a|β/angbracketright, (A.7) and with respect to scalar addition: (a+b)|α/angbracketright=a|α/angbracketright+b|α/angbracketright. (A.8) It is also associative with respect to the ordinary multiplication of scalars: a(b|α/angbracketright)=(ab)|α/angbracketright. (A.9) Multiplication by the scalars 0 and 1 has the effect you would expect: 0|α/angbracketright=|0/angbracketright;1|α/angbracketright=|α/angbracketright. (A.10) Evidently|−α/angbracketright=(−1)|α/angbracketright(which we write more simply as −|α/angbracketright. There’s a lot less here than meets the eye—all I have done is to write down in abstract language the familiar rules for manipulating vectors. The virtue of such abstraction is that we will be able to apply our knowledge and intuition about the behavior of ordinary vectors to other systems that happen to share the same formal properties. Alinear combination of the vectors|α/angbracketright,|β/angbracketright,|γ/angbracketright,..., is an expression of the form a|α/angbracketright+b|β/angbracketright+c|γ/angbracketright+···. (A.11) A vector|λ/angbracketrightis said to be linearly independent of the set|α/angbracketright,|β/angbracketright,|γ/angbracketright,..., if it cannot be written as a linear combination of them. (For example, in three dimensions the unit vector ˆkis linearly independent of ˆıandˆj, but any vector in the xyplane is linearly dependent onˆıand ˆj.) By extension, a setof vectors is “linearly independent” if each one is linearly independent of all the rest. A collection of vectors is said to span the space if every vector can be written as a linear combination of the members of this set.5A set of linearly independent vectors that spans the space is called a basis . The number of vectors in any basis is called the dimension of the space. For the moment we shall assume that the dimension (n)isﬁnite . With respect to a prescribed basis |e1/angbracketright,|e2/angbracketright,...,|en/angbracketright, (A.12) any given vector |α/angbracketright=a1|e1/angbracketright+a2|e2/angbracketright+···+ an|en/angbracketright, (A.13) is uniquely represented by the (ordered) n-tuple of its components : |α/angbracketright↔(a1,a2,..., an). (A.14) 5A set of vectors that spans the space is also called complete , though I personally reserve that word for the inﬁnite- dimensional case, where subtle questions of convergence may arise.466 Appendix Linear Algebra It is often easier to work with the components than with the abstract vectors themselves. To add vectors, you add their corresponding components: |α/angbracketright+|β/angbracketright↔(a1+b1,a2+b2,..., an+bn); (A.15) to multiply by a scalar you multiply each component: c|α/angbracketright↔(ca1,ca2,..., can); (A.16) the null vector is represented by a string of zeroes: |0/angbracketright↔(0,0,..., 0); (A.17) and the components of the inverse vector have their signs reversed: |−α/angbracketright↔(−a1,−a2,...,−an). (A.18) The only disadvantage of working with components is that you have to commit yourself to a particular basis, and the same manipulations will look very different to someone using a different basis. Problem A.1 Consider the ordinary vectors in three dimensions/parenleftBig axˆı+ayˆj+azˆk/parenrightBig , with complex components. (a)Does the subset of all vectors with az=0 constitute a vector space? If so, what is its dimension; if not, why not? (b)What about the subset of all vectors whose zcomponent is 1? Hint: Would the sum of two such vectors be in the subset? How about the null vector? (c)What about the subset of vectors whose components are all equal? ∗ Problem A.2 Consider the collection of all polynomials (with complex coefﬁcients) of degree<Ninx. (a)Does this set constitute a vector space (with the polynomials as “vectors”)? If so, suggest a convenient basis, and give the dimension of the space. If not, which of the deﬁning properties does it lack? (b)What if we require that the polynomials be even functions? (c)What if we require that the leading coefﬁcient (i.e. the number multiplying xN−1) be 1? (d)What if we require that the polynomials have the value 0 at x=1? (e)What if we require that the polynomials have the value 1 at x=0? Problem A.3 Prove that the components of a vector with respect to a given basis are unique . A.2 INNER PRODUCTS In three dimensions we encounter two kinds of vector products: the dot product and the cross product. The latter does not generalize in any natural way to n-dimensional vector spaces, but the former does—in this context it is usually called the inner product . The inner productA.2 Inner Products 467 of vectors|α/angbracketrightand|β/angbracketrightis a complex number (which we write as /angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright), with the following properties: /angbracketleftβ|α/angbracketright=/angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright∗, (A.19) /angbracketleftα|α/angbracketright≥0,and/angbracketleftα|α/angbracketright=0⇔|α/angbracketright=|0/angbracketright, (A.20) /angbracketleftα|(b|β/angbracketright+c|γ/angbracketright)=b/angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright+c/angbracketleftα|γ/angbracketright. (A.21) Apart from the generalization to complex numbers, these axioms simply codify the familiar behavior of dot products. A vector space with an inner product is called an inner product space . Because the inner product of any vector with itself is a non-negative number (Equation A.20 ), its square root is real—we call this the norm of the vector: /bardblα/bardbl≡/radicalbig /angbracketleftα|α/angbracketright; (A.22) it generalizes the notion of “length.” A unit vector (one whose norm is 1) is said to be normal- ized (the word should really be “normal,” but I guess that sounds too judgmental). Two vectors whose inner product is zero are called orthogonal (generalizing the notion of “perpendicular”). A collection of mutually orthogonal normalized vectors, /angbracketleftbig αi/vextendsingle/vextendsingleαj/angbracketrightbig =δij, (A.23) is called an orthonormal set . It is always possible (see Problem A.4), and almost always convenient, to choose an orthonormal basis; in that case the inner product of two vectors can be written very neatly in terms of their components: /angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright=a∗ 1b1+a∗ 2b2+···+ a∗ nbn, (A.24) the norm (squared) becomes /angbracketleftα|α/angbracketright=|a1|2+|a2|2+···+|an|2, (A.25) and the components themselves are ai=/angbracketleftei|α/angbracketright. (A.26) (These results generalize the familiar formulas a·b=axbx+ayby+azbz,|a|2=a2 x+a2 y+a2 z, andax=ˆı·a,ay=ˆj·a,az=ˆk·a, for the three-dimensional orthonormal basis ˆı,ˆj,ˆk.) From now on we shall always work in orthonormal bases, unless it is explicitly indicated otherwise. Another geometrical quantity one might wish to generalize is the angle between two vectors. In ordinary vector analysis cos θ=(a·b)/|a||b|, but because the inner product is in general a complex number, the analogous formula (in an arbitrary inner product space) does not deﬁne a (real) angleθ. Nevertheless, it is still true that the absolute value of this quantity is a number no greater than 1, |/angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright|2≤/angbracketleftα|α/angbracketright/angbracketleftβ|β/angbracketright. (A.27) This important result is known as the Schwarz inequality ; the proof is given in Problem A.5. So you can, if you like, deﬁne the angle between |α/angbracketrightand|β/angbracketrightby the formula cosθ=/radicalBigg /angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright/angbracketleftβ|α/angbracketright /angbracketleftα|α/angbracketright/angbracketleftβ|β/angbracketright. (A.28)468 Appendix Linear Algebra ∗ Problem A.4 Suppose you start out with a basis (|e1/angbracketright,|e2/angbracketright,...,|en/angbracketright)that is notorthonor- mal. The Gram–Schmidt procedure is a systematic ritual for generating from it an orthonormal basis (|e/prime 1/angbracketright,|e/prime 2/angbracketright,...,|e/prime n/angbracketright). It goes like this: (i)Normalize the ﬁrst basis vector (divide by its norm): /vextendsingle/vextendsinglee/prime 1/angbracketrightbig =|e1/angbracketright /bardble1/bardbl. (ii)Find the projection of the second vector along the ﬁrst, and subtract it off: |e2/angbracketright−/angbracketleftbig e/prime 1/vextendsingle/vextendsinglee2/angbracketrightbig/vextendsingle/vextendsinglee/prime 1/angbracketrightbig . This vector is orthogonal to |e/prime 1/angbracketright; normalize it to get |e/prime 2/angbracketright. (iii)Subtract from|e3/angbracketrightits projections along |e/prime 1/angbracketrightand|e/prime 2/angbracketright: |e3/angbracketright−/angbracketleftbig e/prime 1/vextendsingle/vextendsinglee3/angbracketrightbig/vextendsingle/vextendsinglee/prime 1/angbracketrightbig −/angbracketleftbig e/prime 2/vextendsingle/vextendsinglee3/angbracketrightbig/vextendsingle/vextendsinglee/prime 2/angbracketrightbig . This is orthogonal to |e/prime 1/angbracketrightand|e/prime 2/angbracketright; normalize it to get |e/prime 3/angbracketright. And so on. Use the Gram–Schmidt procedure to orthonormalize the 3-space basis |e1/angbracketright=(1+i) ˆı+(1)ˆj+(i)ˆk,|e2/angbracketright=(i)ˆı+(3)ˆj+(1)ˆk,|e3/angbracketright=(0)ˆı+(28)ˆj+(0)ˆk. Problem A.5 Prove the Schwarz inequality (Equation A.27 ).Hint: Let|γ/angbracketright=|β/angbracketright− (/angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright//angbracketleftα|α/angbracketright)|α/angbracketright, and use/angbracketleftγ|γ/angbracketright≥0. Problem A.6 Find the angle (in the sense of Equation A.28 ) between the vectors |α/angbracketright= (1+i)ˆı+(1)ˆj+(i)ˆkand|β/angbracketright=(4−i)ˆı+(0)ˆj+(2−2i)ˆk. Problem A.7 Prove the triangle inequality :/bardbl(|α/angbracketright+|β/angbracketright)/bardbl≤/bardblα/bardbl+/bardblβ/bardbl. A.3 MATRICES Suppose you take every vector (in 3-space) and multiply it by 17, or you rotate every vector by 39◦about the zaxis, or you reﬂect every vector in the xyplane—these are all examples of linear transformations . A linear transformation6/parenleftbigˆT/parenrightbig takes each vector in a vector space and “transforms” it into some other vector (|α/angbracketright→|α/prime/angbracketright=ˆT|α/angbracketright), subject to the condition that the operation be linear: ˆT(a|α/angbracketright+b|β/angbracketright)=a/parenleftBig ˆT|α/angbracketright/parenrightBig +b/parenleftBig ˆT|β/angbracketright/parenrightBig , (A.29) for any vectors |α/angbracketright,|β/angbracketrightand any scalars a,b. If you know what a particular linear transformation does to a set of basis vectors, you can easily ﬁgure out what it does to anyvector. For suppose that 6In this chapter I’ll use a hat (ˆ) to denote linear transformations; this is not inconsistent with my convention in the text (putting hats on operators), for (as we shall see) quantum operators arelinear transformations.A.3 Matrices 469 ˆT|e1/angbracketright=T11|e1/angbracketright+T21|e2/angbracketright+···+ Tn1|en/angbracketright, ˆT|e2/angbracketright=T12|e1/angbracketright+T22|e2/angbracketright+···+ Tn2|en/angbracketright, ··· ˆT|en/angbracketright=T1n|e1/angbracketright+T2n|e2/angbracketright+···+ Tnn|en/angbracketright, or, more compactly, ˆT/vextendsingle/vextendsingleej/angbracketrightbig =n/summationdisplay i=1Tij|ei/angbracketright,( j=1,2,..., n).

(A.32) EvidentlyˆTtakes a vector with components a1,a2,..., aninto a vector with components7 a/prime i=n/summationdisplay j=1Tijaj. (A.33) Thus the n2elements Tijuniquely characterize the linear transformation ˆT(with respect to a given basis), just as the ncomponents aiuniquely characterize the vector |α/angbracketright(with respect to that basis): ˆT↔(T11,T12,..., Tnn). (A.34) If the basis is orthonormal, it follows from Equation A.30 that Tij=/angbracketleftBig ei/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆT/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleej/angbracketrightBig . (A.35) It is convenient to display these complex numbers in the form of a matrix :8 T=⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝T11T12... T1n T21T22... T2n ......... Tn1Tn2... Tnn⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠. (A.36) The study of linear transformations reduces, then, to the theory of matrices. The sum of two linear transformations/parenleftBig ˆS+ˆT/parenrightBig is deﬁned in the natural way: /parenleftBig ˆS+ˆT/parenrightBig |α/angbracketright=ˆS|α/angbracketright+ˆT|α/angbracketright; (A.37) 7Notice the reversal of indices between Equations A.30 andA.33 . This is not a typographical error. Another way of putting it (switching i↔jin Equation A.30 )i st h a ti ft h e components transform with Tij,t h e basis vectors transform with Tji. 8I’ll use boldface capital letters, sans serif, to denote square matrices.470 Appendix Linear Algebra this matches the usual rule for adding matrices (you add the corresponding elements): U=S+T⇔Uij=Sij+Tij. (A.38) The product of two linear transformations/parenleftBig ˆSˆT/parenrightBig is the net effect of performing them in succession—ﬁrst ˆT, thenˆS: /vextendsingle/vextendsingleα/prime/angbracketrightbig =ˆT|α/angbracketright;/vextendsingle/vextendsingleα/prime/prime/angbracketrightbig =ˆS/vextendsingle/vextendsingleα/prime/angbracketrightbig =ˆS/parenleftBig ˆT|α/angbracketright/parenrightBig =ˆSˆT|α/angbracketright. (A.39) What matrix Urepresents the combined transformation ˆU=ˆSˆT? It’s not hard to work it out: a/prime/prime i=n/summationdisplay j=1Sija/prime j=n/summationdisplay j=1Sij/parenleftBiggn/summationdisplay k=1Tjkak/parenrightBigg =n/summationdisplay k=1⎛ ⎝n/summationdisplay j=1SijTjk⎞ ⎠ak=n/summationdisplay k=1Uikak. Evidently U=ST⇔Uik=n/summationdisplay j=1SijTjk (A.40) —this is the standard rule for matrix multiplication: to ﬁnd the ikth element of the product, you look at the ith row of S, and the kth column of T, multiply corresponding entries, and add. The same prescription allows you to multiply rectangular matrices, as long as the number of columns in the ﬁrst matches the number of rows in the second. In particular, if we write the n-tuple of components of |α/angbracketrightas an n×1column matrix (or “column vector”):9 a≡⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝a1 a2 ... an⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠, (A.41) the transformation rule (Equation A.33 ) can be expressed as a matrix product: a/prime=Ta. (A.42) Now some matrix terminology: •Thetranspose of a matrix (which we shall write with a tilde: ˜T) is the same set of elements, but with rows and columns interchanged. In particular, the transpose of a column matrix is a row matrix : ˜a=/parenleftbig a1a2... an/parenrightbig . (A.43) For a square matrix taking the transpose amounts to reﬂecting in the main diagonal (upper left to lower right): ˜T=⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝T11T21... Tn1 T12T22... Tn2 ......... T1nT2n... Tnn⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠. (A.44) 9I’ll use a boldface lower-case letters, sans serif, for row and column matrices.A.3 Matrices 471 A (square) matrix is symmetric if it is equal to its transpose; it is antisymmetric if this operation reverses the sign: symmetric:˜T=T;antisymmetric :˜T=− T. (A.45) •The (complex) conjugate of a matrix (which we denote, as usual, with an asterisk, T∗), consists of the complex conjugate of every element: T∗=⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝T∗ 11T∗ 12... T∗ 1n T∗ 21T∗ 22... T∗ 2n......... T∗ n1T∗ n2... T∗ nn⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠;a∗=⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝a∗ 1 a∗ 2... a∗ n⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠. (A.46) Am a t r i xi s realif all its elements are real, and imaginary if they are all imaginary: real:T∗=T;imaginary:T∗=− T. (A.47) •Thehermitian conjugate (oradjoint ) of a matrix (indicated by a dagger, T†) is the transpose conjugate: T†≡˜T∗=⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝T∗ 11T∗ 21... T∗ n1 T∗ 12T∗ 22... T∗ n2......... T∗ 1nT∗ 2n... T∗ nn⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠;a†≡˜a∗=/parenleftbig a∗ 1a∗ 2... a∗ n/parenrightbig . (A.48) A square matrix is hermitian (orself-adjoint ) if it is equal to its hermitian conju- gate; if hermitian conjugation introduces a minus sign, the matrix is skew hermitian (or anti-hermitian ): hermitian:T†=T;skew hermitian :T†=− T. (A.49) In this notation the inner product of two vectors (with respect to an orthonormal basis— Equation A.24 ), can be written very neatly as a matrix product: /angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright=a†b. (A.50) Notice that each of the three operations deﬁned in this paragraph, if applied twice, returns you to the original matrix. Matrix multiplication is not, in general, commutative (ST/negationslash=TS);t h e difference between the two orderings is called the commutator :10 /bracketleftbig S, T/bracketrightbig ≡ST−TS. (A.51) The transpose of a product is the product of the transposes in reverse order : /parenleftBig /tildewideST/parenrightBig =˜T˜S, (A.52) (see Problem A.11 ), and the same goes for hermitian conjugates: /parenleftbig ST/parenrightbig†=T†S†. (A.53) 10The commutator only makes sense for square matrices, of course; for rectangular matrices the two orderings wouldn’t even be the same size.472 Appendix Linear Algebra The identity matrix (representing a linear transformation that carries every vector into itself) consists of ones on the main diagonal, and zeroes everywhere else: I≡⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝10... 0 01... 0 ......... 00... 1⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠. (A.54) In other words, Iij=δij. (A.55) Theinverse of a (square) matrix (written T−1) is deﬁned in the obvious way:11 T−1T=TT−1=I. (A.56) A matrix has an inverse if and only if its determinant12is nonzero; in fact, T−1=1 detT˜C, (A.57) where Cis the matrix of cofactors (the cofactor of element Tijis(−1)i+jtimes the determinant of the submatrix obtained from Tby erasing the ith row and the jth column). A matrix that has no inverse is said to be singular . The inverse of a product (assuming it exists) is the product of the inverses in reverse order : /parenleftbig ST/parenrightbig−1=T−1S−1. (A.58) Am a t r i xi s unitary if its inverse is equal to its hermitian conjugate:13 unitary:U†=U−1. (A.59) Assuming the basis is orthonormal, the columns of a unitary matrix constitute an orthonormal set, and so too do its rows (see Problem A.12 ). Linear transformations represented by unitary matrices preserve inner products, since (Equation A.50 ) /angbracketleftbig α/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingleβ/prime/angbracketrightbig =a/prime†b/prime=(Ua)†(Ub)=a†U†Ub=a†b=/angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright. (A.60) ∗ Problem A.8 Given the following two matrices: A=⎛ ⎝−11 i 20 3 2i−2i2⎞ ⎠,B=⎛ ⎝20−i 01 0 i32⎞ ⎠, compute: (a) A+B,( b ) AB,( c )/bracketleftbig A,B/bracketrightbig ,( d )˜A,( e ) A∗,( f ) A†, (g) det(B), and (h) B−1. Check that BB−1=1. Does Ahave an inverse? 11Note that the left inverse is equal to the right inverse, for if AT=Iand TB=I, then (multiplying the second on the left by Aand invoking the ﬁrst) we get B=A. 12I assume you know how to evaluate determinants. If not, see Mary L. Boas, Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences , 3rd edn (John Wiley, New York, 2006), Section 3.3. 13In arealvector space (that is, one in which the scalars are real) the hermitian conjugate is the same as the transpose, and a unitary matrix is orthogonal :˜O=O−1. For example, rotations in ordinary 3-space are represented by orthogonal matrices.A.4 Changing Bases 473 ∗ Problem A.9 Using the square matrices in Problem A.8, and the column matrices a=⎛ ⎝i 2i 2⎞ ⎠,b=⎛ ⎝2 (1−i) 0⎞ ⎠, ﬁnd: (a) Aa,( b ) a†b,( c )˜aBb,( d ) ab†. Problem A.10 By explicit construction of the matrices in question, show that any matrix T can be written (a)as the sum of a symmetric matrix Sand an antisymmetric matrix A; (b)as the sum of a real matrix Rand an imaginary matrix M; (c)as the sum of a hermitian matrix Hand a skew-hermitian matrix K. ∗ Problem A.11 Prove Equations A.52 ,A.53 , and A.58 . Show that the product of two unitary matrices is unitary. Under what conditions is the product of two hermitian matrices hermi- tian? Is the sum of two unitary matrices necessarily unitary? Is the sum of two hermitian matrices always hermitian? Problem A.12 Show that the rows and columns of a unitary matrix constitute orthonormal sets. Problem A.13 Noting that det(˜T)=det(T), show that the determinant of a hermitian matrix is real, the determinant of a unitary matrix has modulus 1 (hence the name), and the determinant of an orthogonal matrix (footnote 13) is either+1o r−1. A.4 CHANGING BASES The components of a vector depend, of course, on your (arbitrary) choice of basis, and so do the elements of the matrix representing a linear transformation. We might inquire how these numbers change when we switch to a different basis. The old basis vectors, |ei/angbracketrightare—like all vectors—linear combinations of the new ones, |fi/angbracketright: |e1/angbracketright=S11|f1/angbracketright+S21|f2/angbracketright+···+ Sn1|fn/angbracketright, |e2/angbracketright=S12|f1/angbracketright+S22|f2/angbracketright+···+ Sn2|fn/angbracketright, ··· |en/angbracketright=S1n|f1/angbracketright+S2n|f2/angbracketright+···+ Snn|fn/angbracketright, (for some set of complex numbers Sij), or, more compactly,474 Appendix Linear Algebra |ej/angbracketright=n/summationdisplay i=1Sij|fi/angbracketright,( j=1,2,..., n). (A.61) This is itself a linear transformation (compare Equation A.30 ),14and we know immediately how the components transform: af i=n/summationdisplay j=1Sijae j, (A.62) (where the superscript indicates the basis). In matrix form af=Sae. (A.63) What about the matrix representing a linear transformation ˆT—how is itmodiﬁed by a change of basis? Well, in the old basis we had (Equation A.42 ) a/primee=Teae, and Equation A.63 —multiplying both sides by S−1—entails15ae=S−1af,s o a/primef=Sa/primee=S/parenleftbig Teae/parenrightbig =STeS−1af. Evidently Tf=STeS−1. (A.64) In general, two matrices ( T1and T2) are said to be similar ifT2=ST1S−1for some (non- singular) matrix S. What we have just found is that matrices representing the same linear transformation, with respect to different bases, are similar . Incidentally, if the ﬁrst basis is orthonormal, the second will also be orthonormal if and only if the matrix Sisunitary (see Problem A.16 ). Since we always work in orthonormal bases, we are interested mainly in unitary similarity transformations. While the elements of the matrix representing a given linear transformation may look very different in the new basis, twonumbers associated with the matrix are unchanged: the deter- minant and the trace . For the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants, and hence det/parenleftBig Tf/parenrightBig =det/parenleftBig STeS−1/parenrightBig =det/parenleftbig S/parenrightbig det/parenleftbig Te/parenrightbig det/parenleftBig S−1/parenrightBig =detTe. (A.65) And the trace, which is the sum of the diagonal elements , Tr(T)≡m/summationdisplay i=1Tii, (A.66) has the property (see Problem A.17 ) that Tr(T1T2)=Tr(T2T1), (A.67) 14Notice, however, the radically different perspective: In this case we’re talking about one and the same vector , referred to two completely different bases , whereas before we were thinking of a completely different vector, referred to the same basis. 15Note that S−1certainly exists—if Swere singular, the |fi/angbracketrights would not span the space, so they wouldn’t constitute a basis.A.5 Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues 475 (for any two matrices T1and T2), so Tr/parenleftBig Tf/parenrightBig =Tr/parenleftBig STeS−1/parenrightBig =Tr/parenleftBig TeS−1S/parenrightBig =Tr/parenleftbig Te/parenrightbig . (A.68) Problem A.14 Using the standard basis/parenleftBig ˆı,ˆj,ˆk/parenrightBig for vectors in three dimensions: (a)Construct the matrix representing a rotation through angle θ(counterclockwise, looking down the axis toward the origin) about the zaxis. (b)Construct the matrix representing a rotation by 120◦(counterclockwise, looking down the axis) about an axis through the point (1,1,1). (c)Construct the matrix representing reﬂection through the xyplane. (d)Check that all these matrices are orthogonal, and calculate their determinants. Problem A.15 In the usual basis/parenleftBig ˆı,ˆj,ˆk/parenrightBig , construct the matrix Txrepresenting a rotation through angleθabout the xaxis, and the matrix Tyrepresenting a rotation through angle θabout the yaxis. Suppose now we change bases, to ˆı/prime=ˆj,ˆj/prime=−ˆı,ˆk/prime=ˆk. Construct the matrix Sthat effects this change of basis, and check that STxS−1and STyS−1are what you would expect. Problem A.16 Show that similarity preserves matrix multiplication (that is, if AeBe=Ce, then AfBf=Cf). Similarity does not, in general, preserve symmetry, reality, or hermitic- ity; show, however, that if Sisunitary , and Heis hermitian, then Hfis hermitian. Show that Scarries an orthonormal basis into another orthonormal basis if and only if it is unitary. ∗ Problem A.17 Prove that Tr(T1T2)=T r(T2T1). It follows immediately that Tr (T1T2T3)= Tr(T2T3T1), but is it the case that Tr (T1T2T3)=T r(T2T1T3), in general? Prove it, or disprove it.Hint: The best disproof is always a counterexample—the simpler the better! A.5 EIGENVECTORS AND EIGENVALUES Consider the linear transformation in 3-space consisting of a rotation, about some speciﬁed axis, by an angle θ. Most vectors (with tails at the origin) will change in a rather complicated way (they ride around on a cone about the axis), but vectors that happen to lie along the axis have very simple behavior: They don’t change at all (ˆT|α/angbracketright=|α/angbracketright).I fθis 180◦, then vectors which lie in the the “equatorial” plane reverse signs (ˆT|α/angbracketright=−|α/angbracketright). In a complex vector space16every linear transformation has “special” vectors like these, which are transformed into scalar multiples of themselves: 16This is notalways true in a realvector space (where the scalars are restricted to real values). See Problem A.18 .476 Appendix Linear Algebra ˆT|α/angbracketright=λ|α/angbracketright; (A.69) they are called eigenvectors of the transformation, and the (complex) number λis their eigen- value .( T h e nullvector doesn’t count, even though in a trivial sense it obeys Equation A.69 foranyˆTandanyλ; technically, an eigenvector is any nonzero vector satisfying Equation A.69 .) Notice that any (nonzero) multiple of an eigenvector is still an eigenvector, with the same eigenvalue. With respect to a particular basis, the eigenvector equation assumes the matrix form Ta=λa,( a/negationslash=0), (A.70) or (T−λI)a=0. (A.71) (Here 0is the (column) matrix whose elements are all zero.) Now, if the matrix (T−λI)had an inverse , we could multiply both sides of Equation A.71 by(T−λI)−1, and conclude that a=0. But by assumption aisnotzero, so the matrix (T−λI)must in fact be singular, which means that its determinant is zero: det(T−λI)=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(T11−λ) T12... T1n T21(T22−λ)... T2n ......... Tn1 Tn2...(Tnn−λ)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=0. (A.72) Expansion of the determinant yields an algebraic equation for λ: Cnλn+Cn−1λn−1+···+ C1λ+C0=0, (A.73) where the coefﬁcients Cidepend on the elements of T(see Problem A.20 ). This is called the characteristic equation for the matrix; its solutions determine the eigenvalues. Notice that it’s annth-order equation, so (by the fundamental theorem of algebra ) it has n(complex) roots.17 However, some of these may be multiple roots, so all we can say for certain is that an n×n matrix has at least one andat most n distinct eigenvalues. The collection of all the eigenvalues of a matrix is called its spectrum ; if two (or more) linearly independent eigenvectors share the same eigenvalue, the spectrum is said to be degenerate . To construct the eigen vectors it is generally easiest simply to plug each λback into Equation A.70 and solve “by hand” for the components of a. I’ll show you how it goes by working out an example. Example A.1 Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the following matrix: M=⎛ ⎝20−2 −2ii 2i 10−1⎞ ⎠. (A.74) 17It is here that the case of realvector spaces becomes more awkward, because the characteristic equation need not have any (real) solutions at all. See Problem A.18 .A.5 Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues 477 Solution: The characteristic equation is /vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(2−λ) 0−2 −2i(i−λ) 2i 10 (−1−λ)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=−λ3+(1+i)λ2−iλ=0, (A.75) and its roots are 0, 1, and i. Call the components of the ﬁrst eigenvector (a1,a2,a3); then ⎛ ⎝20−2 −2ii 2i 10−1⎞ ⎠⎛ ⎝a1 a2 a3⎞ ⎠=0⎛ ⎝a1 a2 a3⎞ ⎠=⎛ ⎝0 0 0⎞ ⎠, which yields three equations: 2a1−2a3=0, −2ia1+ia2+2ia3=0, a1−a3=0. The ﬁrst determines a3(in terms of a1):a3=a1; the second determines a2:a2=0; and the third is redundant. We may as well pick a1=1 (since any multiple of an eigenvector is still an eigenvector): a(1)=⎛ ⎝1 0 1⎞ ⎠,forλ1=0. (A.76) For the second eigenvector (recycling the same notation for the components) we have ⎛ ⎝20−2 −2ii 2i 10−1⎞ ⎠⎛ ⎝a1 a2 a3⎞ ⎠=1⎛ ⎝a1 a2 a3⎞ ⎠=⎛ ⎝a1 a2 a3⎞ ⎠, which leads to the equations 2a1−2a3=a1, −2ia1+ia2+2ia3=a2, a1−a3=a3, with the solution a3=(1/2)a1,a2=/bracketleftbig (1−i)/2/bracketrightbig a1; this time I’ll pick a1=2, so a(2)=⎛ ⎝2 1−i 1⎞ ⎠,forλ2=1. (A.77) Finally, for the third eigenvector, ⎛ ⎝20−2 −2ii 2i 10−1⎞ ⎠⎛ ⎝a1 a2 a3⎞ ⎠=i⎛ ⎝a1 a2 a3⎞ ⎠=⎛ ⎝ia1 ia2 ia3⎞ ⎠, which gives the equations 2a1−2a3=ia1, −2ia1+ia2+2ia3=ia2, a1−a3=ia3,478 Appendix Linear Algebra whose solution is a3=a1=0, with a2undetermined. Choosing a2=1, we conclude a(3)=⎛ ⎝0 1 0⎞ ⎠,forλ3=i. (A.78) If the eigenvectors span the space (as they do in the preceding example), we are free to use them as a basis: ˆT|f1/angbracketright=λ1|f1/angbracketright, ˆT|f2/angbracketright=λ2|f2/angbracketright, ··· ˆT|fn/angbracketright=λn|fn/angbracketright. In this basis the matrix representing ˆTtakes on a very simple form, with the eigenvalues strung out along the main diagonal, and all other elements zero: T=⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝λ10... 0 0λ2... 0 ......... 00... λ n⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠, (A.79) and the (normalized) eigenvectors are ⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝1 0 0 ... 0⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠,⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝0 1 0 ... 0⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠, ... ,⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝0 0 0 ... 1⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠. (A.80) A matrix that can be brought to diagonal form (Equation A.79 ) by a change of basis is said to be diagonalizable (evidently a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its eigenvectors span the space). The similarity matrix that effects the diagonalization can be constructed by using the eigenvectors (in the old basis) as the columns of S−1: /parenleftBig S−1/parenrightBig ij=/parenleftBig a(j)/parenrightBig i. (A.81) Example A.2 In Example A.1, S−1=⎛ ⎝120 0(1−i)1 110⎞ ⎠, so (using Equation A.57 ) S=⎛ ⎝−10 2 10−1 (i−1)1(1−i)⎞ ⎠;A.5 Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues 479 you can check for yourself that Sa(1)=⎛ ⎝1 0 0⎞ ⎠,Sa(2)=⎛ ⎝0 1 0⎞ ⎠,Sa(3)=⎛ ⎝0 0 1⎞ ⎠, and SMS−1=⎛ ⎝000 010 00 i⎞ ⎠. There’s an obvious advantage in bringing a matrix to diagonal form: it’s much easier to work with. Unfortunately, not every matrix canbe diagonalized—the eigenvectors have to span the space. If the characteristic equation has ndistinct roots, then the matrix is certainly diagonalizable, but it may be diagonalizble even if there are multiple roots. (For an example of a matrix that cannot be diagonalized, see Problem A.19 .) It would be handy to know in advance (before working out all the eigenvectors) whether a given matrix is diagonalizable. A useful sufﬁcient (though not necessary) condition is the following: A matrix is said to be normal if it commutes with its hermitian conjugate: normal:/bracketleftBig N†,N/bracketrightBig =0. (A.82) Every normal matrix is diagonalizable (its eigenvectors span the space). In particular, every hermitian matrix is diagonalizable, and so is every unitary matrix. Suppose we have twodiagonalizable matrices; in quantum applications the question often arises: Can they be simultaneously diagonalized (by the same similarity matrix S)? That is to say, does there exist a basis all of whose members are eigenvectors of both matrices? In this basis, both matrices would be diagonal. The answer is yes if and only if the two matrices commute , as we shall now prove. (By the way, if two matrices commute with respect to one basis, they commute with respect to anybasis—see Problem A.23 .) We ﬁrst show that if a basis of simultaneous eigenvectors exists then the matrices commute. Actually, it’s trivial in the (simultaneously) diagonal form: TV=⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝λ10··· 0 0λ2··· 0 ............ 00···λn⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝ν10··· 0 0ν2··· 0 ............ 00···νn⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠ =⎛ ⎜⎜⎜⎝λ1ν1 0··· 0 0λ2ν2··· 0 ............ 00···λnνn⎞ ⎟⎟⎟⎠=VT. (A.83) The converse is trickier. We start with the special case where the spectrum of Tis nondegenerate. Let the basis of eigenvectors of Tbe labeled a(i) Ta(i)=λia(i). (A.84) We assume/bracketleftbig T,V/bracketrightbig =0and we want to prove that a(i)is also an eigenvector of V. /bracketleftbig T,V/bracketrightbig a(i)=0, or TVa(i)−VTa(i)=0 (A.85)480 Appendix Linear Algebra and from Equation A.84 T/parenleftBig Va(i)/parenrightBig =λi/parenleftBig Va(i)/parenrightBig . (A.86) Equation A.86 says that the vector b(i)≡Va(i)is an eigenvector of Twith eigenvalue λi.B u t by assumption, the spectrum of Tis nondegenerate and that means that b(i)must be (up to a constant) a(i)itself. If we call the constant νi, b(i)=Va(i)=νia(i), (A.87) soa(i)is an eigenvector of V. All that remains is to relax the assumption of nondegeneracy. Assume now that Thas at least one degenerate eigenvalue such that both a(1)and a(2)are eigenvectors of Twith the same eigenvalueλ0: Ta(1)=λ0a(1) Ta(2)=λ0a(2). We again assume that the matrices Tand Vcommute, so /bracketleftbig T,V/bracketrightbig a(1)=0 /bracketleftbig T,V/bracketrightbig a(2)=0, which leads to the conclusion (as in the nondegenerate case) that both b(1)≡Va(1)and b(2)≡ Va(2)are eigenvectors of Twith eigenvalue λ0. But this time we can’t say that b(1)is a constant times a(1)since any linear combination of a(1)and a(2)is an eigenvector of Twith eigenvalue λ0. All we know is that b(1)=Va(1)=c11a(1)+c21a(2) b(2)=Va(2)=c12a(1)+c22a(2) for some constants cij.S o a(1)and a(2)are not eigenvectors of V(unless the constants c12and c21just happen to vanish). But suppose we choose a different basis of eigenvectors ˜a, ˜a(1)=d11a(1)+d21a(2) ˜a(2)=d12a(1)+d22a(2), (A.88) for some constants dij, such that˜a(1)and˜a(2)areeigenvectors of V: V˜a(i)=νi˜a(i). (A.89) The˜as are still eigenvectors of T, with the same eigenvalue λ0, since any linear combinations of a(1)and a(2)are. But canwe construct linear combinations ( A.88 ) that are eigenvectors of V— how do we get the appropriate coefﬁcients dij?Answer: We solve the eigenvalue problem18 /parenleftbiggc11c12 c21c22/parenrightbigg /bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright C/parenleftbiggd1i d2i/parenrightbigg =νi/parenleftbiggd1i d2i/parenrightbigg . (A.90) 18You might worry that the matrix Cis not diagonalizable, but you need not. The matrix Cis a 2×2 block of the transformation ˆVwritten in the basis a(i); it is diagonalizable by virtue of the fact that Vitself is diagonalizable.A.5 Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues 481 I’ll let you show (Problem A.24 ) that the eigenvectors ˜a(i)constructed in this way satisfy Equa- tion A.88 , completing the proof.19What we have seen is that, when the spectrum contains degeneracy, the eigenvectors of one matrix aren’t automatically eigenvectors of a second com- muting matrix, but we can always choose a linear combination of them to form a simultaneous basis of eigenvectors. ∗ Problem A.18 The 2×2 matrix representing a rotation of the xyplane is T=/parenleftbiggcosθ−sinθ sinθ cosθ/parenrightbigg . (A.91) Show that (except for certain special angles—what are they?) this matrix has no real eigen- values. (This reﬂects the geometrical fact that no vector in the plane is carried into itself under such a rotation; contrast rotations in three dimensions.) This matrix does, however, have complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Find them. Construct a matrix Sthat diagonal- izes T. Perform the similarity transformation/parenleftBig STS−1/parenrightBig explicitly, and show that it reduces Tto diagonal form. Problem A.19 Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the following matrix: M=/parenleftbigg11 01/parenrightbigg . Can this matrix be diagonalized? Problem A.20 Show that the ﬁrst, second, and last coefﬁcients in the characteristic equation (Equation A.73 )a r e : Cn=(−1)n,Cn−1=(−1)n−1Tr(T),andC0=det(T). (A.92) For a 3×3 matrix with elements Tij, what is C1? Problem A.21 It’s obvious that the trace of a diagonal matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues, and its determinant is their product (just look at Equation A.79 ). It follows (from Equations A.65 andA.68 ) that the same holds for any diagonalizable matrix. Prove that in fact det(T)=λ1λ2···λn,Tr(T)=λ1+λ2+···+λn, (A.93) foranymatrix. (Theλ’s are the nsolutions to the characteristic equation—in the case of multiple roots, there may be fewer linearly-independent eigen vectors than there are solu- tions, but we still count each λas many times as it occurs.) Hint: Write the characteristic equation in the form (λ1−λ)(λ2−λ)···(λn−λ)=0, and use the result of Problem A.20 . 19I’ve only proved it for a two-fold degeneracy, but the argument extends in the obvious way to a higher-order degeneracy; you simply need to diagonalize a bigger matrix C.482 Appendix Linear Algebra Problem A.22 Consider the matrix M=/parenleftbigg11 1i/parenrightbigg .

A.6 HERMITIAN TRANSFORMATIONS In Equation A.48 I deﬁned the hermitian conjugate (or “adjoint”) of a matrix as its transpose- conjugate: T†=˜T∗. Now I want to give you a more fundamental deﬁnition for the hermitian conjugate of a linear transformation : It is that transformation ˆT†which, when applied to theA.6 Hermitian Transformations 483 ﬁrstmember of an inner product, gives the same result as if ˆTitself had been applied to the second vector:/angbracketleftBig ˆT†α/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleβ/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig α/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆTβ/angbracketrightBig , (A.95) (for all vectors |α/angbracketrightand|β/angbracketright).20I have to warn you that although everybody uses it, this is lousy notation. For αandβare not vectors (thevectors are|α/angbracketrightand|β/angbracketright), they are names .I n particular, they are endowed with no mathematical properties at all, and the expression “ ˆTβ”i s literally nonsense : Linear transformations act on vectors , not labels . But it’s pretty clear what the notation means :ˆTβis the name of the vector ˆT|β/angbracketright, and/angbracketleftˆT†α|β/angbracketrightis the inner product of the vectorˆT†|α/angbracketrightwith the vector |β/angbracketright. Notice in particular that /angbracketleftα|cβ/angbracketright=c/angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright, (A.96) whereas /angbracketleftcα|β/angbracketright=c∗/angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright, (A.97) for any scalar c. If you’re working in an orthonormal basis (as we always do), the hermitian conjugate of a linear transformation is represented by the hermitian conjugate of the corresponding matrix; for (using Equations A.50 andA.53 ), /angbracketleftBig α/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆTβ/angbracketrightBig =a†Tb=/parenleftbig T†a/parenrightbig†b=/angbracketleftBig ˆT†α/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleβ/angbracketrightBig . (A.98) So the terminology is consistent, and we can speak interchangeably in the language of transformations or of matrices. In quantum mechanics, a fundamental role is played by hermitian transformations/parenleftbigˆT†=ˆT/parenrightbig . The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a hermitian transformation have three crucial properties: 1.The eigenvalues of a hermitian transformation are real. Proof: Letλbe an eigenvalue of ˆT:ˆT|α/angbracketright=λ|α/angbracketright, with|α/angbracketright/negationslash=|0/angbracketright. Then /angbracketleftBig α/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆTα/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftα|λα/angbracketright=λ/angbracketleftα|α/angbracketright. Meanwhile, if ˆTis hermitian, then /angbracketleftBig α/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆTα/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig ˆTα/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleα/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftλα|α/angbracketright=λ∗/angbracketleftα|α/angbracketright. But/angbracketleftα|α/angbracketright/negationslash=0 (Equation A.20 ), soλ=λ∗, and henceλis real. QED 2.The eigenvectors of a hermitian transformation belonging to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. Proof: SupposeˆT|α/angbracketright=λ|α/angbracketrightandˆT|β/angbracketright=μ|β/angbracketright, withλ/negationslash=μ. Then /angbracketleftBig α/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆTβ/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftα|μβ/angbracketright=μ/angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright, 20If you’re wondering whether such a transformation necessarily exists , that’s a good question, and the answer is “yes.” See, for instance, Paul R. Halmos, Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces , 2nd edn, van Nostrand, Princeton (1958), Section 44.484 Appendix Linear Algebra and ifˆTis hermitian, /angbracketleftBig α/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆTβ/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftBig ˆTα/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleβ/angbracketrightBig =/angbracketleftλα|β/angbracketright=λ∗/angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright. Butλ=λ∗(from (1)), andλ/negationslash=μ, by assumption, so /angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright=0. QED 3.The eigenvectors of a hermitian transformation span the space. As we have seen, this is equivalent to the statement that any hermitian matrix can be diagonalized. This rather technical fact is, in a sense, the mathematical support on which much of quantum mechanics leans. It turns out to be a thinner reed than one might have hoped, because the proof does not carry over to inﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces. Problem A.27 A hermitian linear transformation must satisfy /angbracketleftα|ˆTβ/angbracketright=/angbracketleftˆTα|β/angbracketrightfor all vectors|α/angbracketrightand|β/angbracketright. Prove that it is (surprisingly) sufﬁcient that /angbracketleftγ|ˆTγ/angbracketright=/angbracketleftˆTγ|γ/angbracketrightfor all vectors|γ/angbracketright.Hint: First let|γ/angbracketright=|α/angbracketright+|β/angbracketright, and then let|γ/angbracketright=|α/angbracketright+i|β/angbracketright. ∗ Problem A.28 Let T=/parenleftbigg11−i 1+i 0/parenrightbigg . (a)Verify that Tis hermitian. (b)Find its eigenvalues (note that they are real). (c)Find and normalize the eigenvectors (note that they are orthogonal). (d)Construct the unitary diagonalizing matrix S, and check explicitly that it diagonal- izes T. (e)Check that det(T)and Tr( T) are the same for Tas they are for its diagonalized form. ∗∗ Problem A.29 Consider the following hermitian matrix: T=⎛ ⎝2 i1 −i2 i 1−i2⎞ ⎠. (a)Calculate det(T)and Tr(T). (b)Find the eigenvalues of T. Check that their sum and product are consistent with (a), in the sense of Equation A.93 . Write down the diagonalized version of T. (c)Find the eigenvectors of T. Within the degenerate sector, construct two linearly inde- pendent eigenvectors (it is this step that is always possible for a hermitian matrix, but not for an arbitrary matrix—contrast Problem A.19 ). Orthogonalize them, and check that both are orthogonal to the third. Normalize all three eigenvectors. (d)Construct the unitary matrix Sthat diagonalizes T, and show explicitly that the similarity transformation using Sreduces Tto the appropriate diagonal form. Problem A.30 Aunitary transformation is one for which ˆU†ˆU=1. (a)Show that unitary transformations preserve inner products, in the sense that /angbracketleftˆUα|ˆUβ/angbracketright=/angbracketleftα|β/angbracketright, for all vectors |α/angbracketright,|β/angbracketright.A.6 Hermitian Transformations 485 (b)Show that the eigenvalues of a unitary transformation have modulus 1. (c)Show that the eigenvectors of a unitary transformation belonging to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. ∗∗∗ Problem A.31 Functions of matrices are typically deﬁned by their Taylor series expansions. For example, eM≡I+M+1 2M2+1 3!M3+···. (A.99) (a)Find exp(M),i f (i)M=⎛ ⎝013 004 000⎞ ⎠;(ii)M=/parenleftbigg0θ −θ0/parenrightbigg . (b)Show that if Mis diagonalizable, then det/parenleftBig eM/parenrightBig =eTr(M). (A.100) Comment: This is actually true even if Misnotdiagonalizable, but it’s harder to prove in the general case. (c)Show that if the matrices Mand Ncommute , then eM+N=eMeN. (A.101) Prove (with the simplest counterexample you can think up) that Equation A.101 is nottrue, in general, for non-commuting matrices.21 (d)IfHis hermitian, show that eiHis unitary. 21See Problem 3.29 for the more general “Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff” formula.I n d e x 2 1 c e n t i m e t e r l i n e 3 1 3 A a b s o r p t i o n 4 1 1 – 4 2 2 , 4 3 6 a c t i v e t r a n s f o r m a t i o n 2 3 6 –
