Our approach to the subject, as in all previous editions, emphasizes the physical concepts of ﬂuidmechanics and methods of analysis that begin from basic principles. The primaryobjective of this text is to help users develop an orderly approach to problem solving.Thus we always start from governing equations, state assumptions clearly, and try torelate mathematical results to corresponding physical behavior. We continueto emphasize the use of control volumes to maintain a practical problem-solvingapproach that is also theoretically inclusive. Proven Problem-Solving Methodology The Fox-McDonald-Pritchard solution methodology used in this text is illustrated innumerous Examples in each chapter. Solutions presented in the Examples have beenprepared to illustrate good solution technique and to explain difﬁcult points of theory.Examples are set apart in format from the text so that they are easy to identify andfollow. Additional important information about the text and our procedures is givenin the “Note to Student” in Section 1.1 of the printed text. We urge you to study thissection carefully and to integrate the suggested procedures into your problem-solving and results-presentation approaches. SI and English Units SI units are used in about 70 percent of both Example and end-of-chapter problems. English Engineering units are retained in the remaining problems to provide experience with this traditional system and to highlight conversions among unit sys- tems that may be derived from fundamentals. xiGoals and Advantages of Using This Text Complete explanations presented in the text, together with numerous detailed Examples, make this book understandable for students, freeing the instructor to depart from conventional lecture teaching methods. Classroom time can be used tobring in outside material, expand on special topics (such as non-Newtonian ﬂow,boundary-layer ﬂow, lift and drag, or experimental methods), solve example prob-lems, or explain difﬁcult points of assigned homework problems. In addition, the 51Example Excel workbooks are useful for presenting a variety of ﬂuid mechanics phenomena, especially the effects produced when varying input parameters. Thuseach class period can be used in the manner most appropriate to meet student needs. When students ﬁnish the ﬂuid mechanics course, we expect them to be able to apply the governing equations to a variety of problems, including those they have notencountered previously. We particularly emphasize physical concepts throughout tohelp students model the variety of phenomena that occur in real ﬂuid ﬂow situations.Although we collect, for convenience, useful equations at the end of most chapters, westress that our philosophy is to minimize the use of so-called magic formulas andemphasize the systematic and fundamental approach to problem solving. By followingthis format, we believe students develop conﬁdence in their ability to apply the material and to ﬁnd that they can reason out solutions to rather challenging problems. The book is well suited for independent study by students or practicing engineers. Its readability and clear examples help build conﬁdence. Answer to Selected Problems are included, so students may check their own work. Topical Coverage The material has been selected carefully to include a broad range of topics suitable fora one- or two-semester course at the junior or senior level. We assume a backgroundin rigid-body dynamics and mathematics through differential equations. A back-ground in thermodynamics is desirable for studying compressible ﬂow. More advanced material, not typically covered in a ﬁrst course, has been moved to the Web site (these sections are identiﬁed in the Table of Contents as being on theWeb site). Advanced material is available to interested users of the book; available online, it does not interrupt the topic ﬂow of the printed text. Material in the printed text has been organized into broad topic areas: /C15Introductory concepts, scope of ﬂuid mechanics, and ﬂuid statics (Chapters 1, 2, an d 3) /C15Development and application of control volume forms of basic equations(Cha pter 4) /C15Development and application of differential forms of basic equations (Chapters 5 an d 6) /C15Dimensional analysis and correlation of experimental data (Chapter 7) /C15Applications for internal viscous incompressible ﬂows (Chapter 8) /C15Applications for external viscous incompressible ﬂows (Chapter 9) /C15Analysis of ﬂuid machinery and system applications (Chapter 10) /C15Analysis and applications of open-channel ﬂows (Chapter 11) /C15Analysis and applications of one- and two-dimensional compressible ﬂows (Cha pters 12 and 13) Chapter 4 deals with analysis using both ﬁnite and differential control volumes. The Bernoulli equation is derived (in an optional subsection of Section 4.4) as an examplexii Prefaceapplication of the basic equations to a differential control volume. Being able to use the Bernoulli equation in Chapter 4 allows us to include more challenging problemsdealing with the momentum equation for ﬁnite control volumes. Another derivation of the Bernoulli equation is presented in Chapter 6, where it is obtained by integrating Euler’s equation along a streamline. If an instructor choosesto delay introducing the Bernoulli equation, the challenging problems from Chapter 4may be assigned during study of Chapter 6. Text Features This edition incorporates a number of useful features: /C15Examples : Fifty-one of the Examples include Excel workbooks, available online at the text Web site, making them useful for what-if analyses by students or by the instructor during class. /C15Case Studies : Every chapter begins with a Case Studies in Energy and the Envi- ronment , each describing an interesting application of ﬂuid mechanics in the area of renewable energy or of improving machine efﬁciencies. We have also retained fromthe previous edition chapter-speciﬁc Case Studies , which are now located at the end of chapters. These explore unusual or intriguing applications of ﬂuid mechanics in anumber of areas. /C15Chapter Summary and Useful Equations : At the end of most chapters we collect for the student’s convenience the most used or most signiﬁcant equations of thechapter. Although this is a convenience, we cannot stress enough the need forthe student to ensure an understanding of the derivation and limitations of eachequation before its use! /C15Design Problems : Where appropriate, we have provided open-ended design prob- lems in place of traditional laboratory experiments. For those who do not havecomplete laboratory facilities, students could be assigned to work in teams to solvethese problems. Design problems encourage students to spend more time exploringapplications of ﬂuid mechanics principles to the design of devices and systems. As inthe previous edition, design problems are included with the end-of-chapterproblems /C15Open-Ended Problems : We have included many open-ended problems. Some are thought-provoking questions intended to test understanding of fundamental con-cepts, and some require creative thought, synthesis, and/or narrative discussion. Wehope these problems will help instructors to encourage their students to think andwork in more dynamic ways, as well as to inspire each instructor to develop and usemore open-ended problems. /C15End-of-Chapter Problems : Problems in each chapter are arranged by topic, and within each topic they generally increase in complexity or difﬁculty. This makes iteasy for the instructor to assign homework problems at the appropriate difﬁcultylevel for each section of the book. For convenience, problems are now groupedaccording to the chapter section headings. New to This Edition This edition incorporates a number of signiﬁcant changes: /C15Case Studies in Energy and the Environment : At the beginning of each chapter is a new case study. With these case studies we hope to provide a survey of the most interesting and novel applications of ﬂuid mechanics with the goal of generatingPreface xiiiincreasing amounts of the world’s energy needs from renewable sources. The case studies are not chapter speciﬁc; that is, each one is not necessarily based onthe material of the chapter in which it is presented. Instead, we hope these new case studies will serve as a stimulating narrative on the ﬁeld of renewable energy for the reader and that they will provide material for classroom discussion. The case studiesfrom the previous edition have been retained and relocated to the ends of chapters. /C15Demonstration Videos : The “classic” NCFMF videos (approximately 20 minutes each, with Professor Ascher Shapiro of MIT, a pioneer in the ﬁeld of biomedicalengineering and a leader in ﬂuid mechanics research and education, explaining and demonstrating ﬂuid mechanics concepts) referenced in the previous edition have all been retained and supplemented with additional new brief videos (approximately30 seconds to 2 minutes each) from a variety of sources. Both the classic and new videos are intended to provide visual aids for many of the concepts covered in the text, and are available at www.wiley.com/college/pritchard. /C15CFD : The section on basic concepts of computational ﬂuid dynamics in Chapter 5now includes material on using the spreadsheet for numerical analysis of simpleone- and two-dimensional ﬂows; it includes an introduction to the Euler method. /C15Fluid Machinery : Chapter 10 has been restructured, presenting material for pumps and fans ﬁrst, followed by a section on hydraulic turbines. Propellers and windturbines are now presented together. The section on wind turbines now includes theanalysis of vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) in additional depth. A section oncompressible ﬂow machines has also been added to familiarize students with thedifferences in evaluating performance of compressible versus incompressible ﬂow machines. The data in Appendix D on pumps and fans has been updated to reﬂect new products and new means of presenting data. /C15Open-Channel Flow : In this edition we have completely rewritten the material on open-channel ﬂows. An innovation of this new material compared to similar texts isthat we have treated “local” effects, including the hydraulic jump before con-sidering uniform and gradually varying ﬂows. This material provides a sufﬁcient background on the topic for mechanical engineers and serves as an introduction for civil engineers. /C15Compressible Flow : The material in Chapter 13 has been restructured so that normal shocks are discussed before Fanno and Rayleigh ﬂows. This was donebecause many college ﬂuid mechanics curriculums cover normal shocks but notFanno or Rayleigh ﬂows. /C15New Homework Problems : The eighth edition includes 1705 end-of-chapter prob- lems. Many problems have been combined and contain multiple parts. Most havebeen structured so that all parts need not be assigned at once, and almost 25 percentof subparts have been designed to explore what-if questions. New or modiﬁed forthis edition are some 518 problems, some created by a panel of instructors andsubject matter experts. End-of-chapter homework problems are now grouped according to text sections.

Each solution is prepared in the same systematic way as the Example solutions in the printed text. Each solution CLASSIC VIDEO Classics! VIDEO New Videos! xiv Prefacebegins from governing equations, clearly states assumptions, reduces governing equations to computing equations, obtains an algebraic result, and ﬁnally substitutesnumerical values to calculate a quantitative answer. Solutions may be reproduced for classroom or library use, eliminating the labor of problem solving for the instructor who adopts the text. TheSolutions Manual is available online after the text is adopted.

There is no change to the actual solution to eachof these problems. /C15PowerPoint Lecture Slides : Lecture slides have been developed by Philip Pritchard, outlining the concepts in the book, and including appropriate illustrations andequations. /C15Image Gallery : Illustrations from the text in a format appropriate to include in lecture presentations. Additional Resources /C15A Brief Review of Microsoft Excel : Prepared by Philip Pritchard and included on the book Web site as Appendix H, this resource will coach students in setting upand solving ﬂuid mechanics problems using Excel spreadsheets. Visit www.wiley. com/college/pritchard to access it. /C15Excel Files : These Excel Files and add-ins are for use with speciﬁc Examples from the text. /C15Additional Text Topics : PDF ﬁles for these topics/sections are available only on the Web site. These topics are highlighted in the text’s table of contents and inthe chapters as being available on the Web site. /C15Answers to Selected Problems : Answers to odd-numbered problems are listed at the end of the book as a useful aid for student self-study. /C15Videos : Many worthwhile videos are available on the book Web site to demonstrateand clarify the basic principles of ﬂuid mechanics. When it is appropriate to viewthese videos to aid in understanding concepts or phenomena, an icon appears in themargin of the printed text; the Web site provides links to both classic and newvideos, and these are also listed in Appendix C.

We have tried to present novel andoriginal developments, not the kind of applicationssuch as the ubiquitous wind farms. Please note that case studies represent a narrative; so each chapter’s case study is not necessarily representative of the material in that chapter. Perhaps as a creative newengineer, you’ll be able to create even better ways toextract renewable, nonpolluting forms of energy orinvent something to make ﬂuid-mechanics devices moreefﬁcient! According to the July 16, 2009, edition of the New York Times , the global wind energy potential is much higher than previously estimated by both wind industry groupsand government agencies. (Wind turbines are discussedin Chapter 10.) Using data from thousands of meteo- rological stations, the research indicates that the world’s wind power potential is about 40 times greater thantotal current power consumption; previous studies hadput that multiple at about seven times! In the lower48 states, the potential from wind power is 16 times more 1We decided to title this textbook “Introduction to ...” for the following reason: After studying the text, you will notbe able to design the streamlining of a new car or an airplane, or design a new heart valve, or select the correct air extractors and ducting for a $100 million building; however, you willhave developed a good understanding of the concepts behind all of these, and many other applications, and have made signiﬁcantprogress toward being ready to work on such state-of-the-art ﬂuid mechanics projects. To start toward this goal, in this chapter we cover some very basic topics: a case study, what ﬂuid mechanics encompasses, the standard engineering deﬁnition of a ﬂuid, and the basic equations and methods of analysis. Finally, we discuss some common engineering student pitfalls in areas such as unit systems and experimental analysis.than total electricity demand in the United States, theresearchers suggested, again much higher than a 2008Department of Energy study that projected wind could supply a ﬁfth of all electricity in the country by 2030. The ﬁndings indicate the validity of the often made claimthat “the United States is the Saudi Arabia of wind.”The new estimate is based the idea of deploying 2.5- to3-megawatt (MW) wind turbines in rural areas that areneither frozen nor forested and also on shallow offshorelocations, and it includes a conservative 20 percentestimate for capacity factor, which is a measure of how much energy a given turbine actually produces. It has been estimated that the total power from the wind thatcould conceivably be extracted is about 72 terawatts (TW,72310 12watts). Bearing in mind that the total power consumption by all humans was about 16 TW (as of2006), it is clear that wind energy could supply all theworld’s needs for the foreseeable future! One reason for the new estimate is due to the increasingly common use of very large turbines thatrise to almost 100 m, where wind speeds are greater.Previous wind studies were based on the use of 50- to80-m turbines. In addition, to reach even higher ele-vations (and hence wind speed), two approaches havebeen proposed. In a recent paper, Professor Archer atCalifornia State University and Professor Caldeira atthe Carnegie Institution of Washington, Stanford,discussed some possibilities. One of these is a design ofKiteGen (shown in the ﬁgure), consisting of tethered airfoils (kites) manipulated by a control unit and con- nected to a ground-based, carousel-shaped generator;the kites are maneuvered so that they drive the car-ousel, generating power, possibly as much as 100 MW.This approach would be best for the lowest few kilo-meters of the atmosphere. An approach using furtherincreases in elevation is to generate electricity aloft and then transmit it to the surface with a tether. In the design proposed by Sky Windpower , four rotors are mounted on an airframe; the rotors both provide liftfor the device and power electricity generation. Theaircraft would lift themselves into place with suppliedelectricity to reach the desired altitude but would thengenerate up to 40 MW of power. Multiple arrays couldbe used for large-scale electricity generation. (Airfoils are discussed in Chapter 9.) We shall examine some interesting developments in wind power in the Case Studies in Energy and the Environment in subsequent chapters. Sky Windpower ’s ﬂying electric generators would ﬂy at altitudes of about 10,000 m. (Picture courtesy of Ben Shepard and Archer & Caldeira.) KiteGen’s kites would ﬂy at an altitude of about 1000 m and spin a power carousel on the ground. (Picture courtesy of Ben Shepard andArcher & Caldeira.)2 Chapter 1Introduction1.1 Note to Students This is a student-oriented book: We believe it is quite comprehensive for an intro- ductory text, and a student can successfully self-teach from it. However, most students will use the text in conjunction with one or two undergraduate courses. In either case, werecommend a thorough reading of the relevant chapters. In fact, a good approach is toread a chapter quickly once, then reread more carefully a second and even a third time,so that concepts develop a context and meaning. While students often ﬁnd ﬂuidmechanics quite challenging, we believe this approach, supplemented by your instruc-tor’s lectures that will hopefully amplify and expand upon the text material (if you aretaking a course), will reveal ﬂuid mechanics to be a fascinating and varied ﬁeld of study. Other sources of information on ﬂuid mechanics are readily available. In addition to your professor, there are many other ﬂuid mechanics texts and journals as well asthe Internet (a recent Google search for “ﬂuid mechanics” yielded 26.4 million links,including many with ﬂuid mechanics calculators and animations!). There are some prerequisites for reading this text. We assume you have already studied introductory thermodynamics, as well as statics, dynamics, and calculus;however, as needed, we will review some of this material. It is our strong belief that one learns best by doing . This is true whether the subject under study is ﬂuid mechanics, thermodynamics, or soccer. The fundamentals in anyof these are few, and mastery of them comes through practice. Thus it is extremely important that you solve problems. The numerous problems included at the end ofeach chapter provide the opportunity to practice applying fundamentals to the solu-tion of problems. Even though we provide for your convenience a summary of usefulequations at the end of each chapter (except this one), you should avoid the temp-tation to adopt a so-called plug-and-chug approach to solving problems. Most of theproblems are such that this approach simply will not work. In solving problems we strongly recommend that you proceed using the following logical steps: 1.State brieﬂy and concisely (in your own words) the information given. 2.State the information to be found. 3.Draw a schematic of the system or control volume to be used in the analysis. Be sure to label the boundaries of the system or control volume and label appropriatecoordinate directions. 4.Give the appropriate mathematical formulation of the basic laws that you consider necessary to solve the problem. 5.List the simplifying assumptions that you feel are appropriate in the problem. 6.Complete the analysis algebraically before substituting numerical values. 7.Substitute numerical values (using a consistent set of units) to obtain a numericalanswer. a.Reference the source of values for any physical properties. b.Be sure the signiﬁcant ﬁgures in the answer are consistent with the given data. 8.Check the answer and review the assumptions made in the solution to make surethey are reasonable. 9.Label the answer. In your initial work this problem format may seem unnecessary and even long-winded. However, it is our experience that this approach to problem solving isultimately the most efﬁcient; it will also prepare you to be a successful professional,for which a major prerequisite is to be able to communicate information and the results of an analysis clearly and precisely. This format is used in all Examples pre- sented in this text ; answers to Examples are rounded to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures. Finally, we strongly urge you to take advantage of the many Excel tools available for this book on the text Web site , for use in solving problems. Many problems can be1.1Note to Students 3solved much more quickly using these tools; occasional problems can only be solved with the tools or with an equivalent computer application. 1.2 Scope of Fluid Mechanics As the name implies, ﬂuid mechanics is the study of ﬂuids at rest or in motion. It has traditionally been applied in such areas as the design of canal, levee, and dam systems; the design of pumps, compressors, and piping and ducting used in the water and airconditioning systems of homes and businesses, as well as the piping systems needed inchemical plants; the aerodynamics of automobiles and sub- and supersonic airplanes;and the development of many different ﬂow measurement devices such as gas pumpmeters. While these are still extremely important areas (witness, for example, the current emphasis on automobile streamlining and the levee failures in New Orleans in 2005), ﬂuid mechanics is truly a “high-tech” or “hot” discipline, and many exciting areas have developed in the last quarter-century. Some examples include environmentaland energy issues (e.g., containing oil slicks, large-scale wind turbines, energy gene-ration from ocean waves, the aerodynamics of large buildings, and the ﬂuid mechanicsof the atmosphere and ocean and of phenomena such as tornadoes, hurricanes, andtsunamis); biomechanics (e.g., artiﬁcial hearts and valves and other organs such asthe liver; understanding of the ﬂuid mechanics of blood, synovial ﬂuid in the joints, therespiratory system, the circulatory system, and the urinary system); sport (design of bicycles and bicycle helmets, skis, and sprinting and swimming clothing, and the aerodynamics of the golf, tennis, and soccer ball); “smart ﬂuids” (e.g., in automobilesuspension systems to optimize motion under all terrain conditions, military uniformscontaining a ﬂuid layer that is “thin” until combat, when it can be “stiffened” to givethe soldier strength and protection, and ﬂuid lenses with humanlike properties for usein cameras and cell phones); and microﬂuids (e.g., for extremely precise administra-tion of medications). These are just a small sampling of the newer areas of ﬂuid mechanics. They illus- trate how the discipline is still highly relevant, and increasingly diverse, even though itmay be thousands of years old. 1.3 Deﬁnition of a Fluid We already have a common-sense idea of when we are working with a ﬂuid, asopposed to a solid: Fluids tend to ﬂow when we interact with them (e.g., when you stiryour morning coffee); solids tend to deform or bend (e.g., when you type on a key-board, the springs under the keys compress). Engineers need a more formal andprecise deﬁnition of a ﬂuid: A ﬂuid is a substance that deforms continuously under the application of a shear (tangential) stress no matter how small the shear stress may be.Because the ﬂuid motion continues under the application of a shear stress, we can alsodeﬁne a ﬂuid as any substance that cannot sustain a shear stress when at rest. Hence liquids and gases (or vapors) are the forms, or phases, that ﬂuids can take. We wish to distinguish these phases from the solid phase of matter. We can see thedifference between solid and ﬂuid behavior in Fig. 1.1 . If we place a specimen of either substance between two plates (Fig. 1.1 a) and then apply a shearing force F, each will initially deform (Fig. 1.1 b); however, whereas a solid will then be at rest (assuming the force is not large enough to go beyond its elastic limit), a ﬂuid will continue to deform (Fig. 1.1 c, Fig. 1.1 d, etc) as long as the force is applied. Note that a ﬂuid in contact with a solid surface does not slip—it has the same velocity as that surface because of the no- slipcondition, an experimental fact. CLASSIC VIDEO Deformation of Continuous Media .4 Chapter 1IntroductionThe amount of deformation of the solid depends on the solid’s modulus of rigidity G; in Chapter 2 we will learn that the rate of deformation of the ﬂuid depends on the ﬂuid’s viscosity μ. We refer to solids as being elastic and ﬂuids as being viscous . More informally, we say that solids exhibit “springiness.” For example, when you drive over a pothole, the car bounces up and down due to the car suspension’s metal coil springs compressing and expanding. On the other hand, ﬂuids exhibit friction effects so that the suspension’s shock absorbers (containing a ﬂuid that is forced through a smallopening as the car bounces) dissipate energy due to the ﬂuid friction, which stops thebouncing after a few oscillations. If your shocks are “shot,” the ﬂuid they containedhas leaked out so that there is almost no friction as the car bounces, and it bouncesseveral times rather than quickly coming to rest. The idea that substances can becategorized as being either a solid or a liquid holds for most substances, but a numberof substances exhibit both springiness and friction; they are viscoelastic . Many bio- logical tissues are viscoelastic. For example, the synovial ﬂuid in human knee jointslubricates those joints but also absorbs some of the shock occurring during walking orrunning. Note that the system of springs and shock absorbers comprising the carsuspension is also viscoelastic, although the individual components are not. We willhave more to say on this topic in Chapter 2. 1.4 Basic Equations Analysis of any problem in ﬂuid mechanics necessarily includes statement of the basiclaws governing the ﬂuid motion. The basic laws, which are applicable to any ﬂuid, are: 1.The conservation of mass 2.Newton’s second law of motion 3.The principle of angular momentum 4.The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics 5.The second law of thermodynamics Not all basic laws are always required to solve any one problem. On the other hand, in many problems it is necessary to bring into the analysis additional relations that describe the behavior of physical properties of ﬂuids under given conditions. For example, you probably recall studying properties of gases in basic physics or thermodynamics. The ideal gas equation of state p5ρRT ð1:1Þ is a model that relates density to pressure and temperature for many gases under normal conditions. In Eq. 1.1 ,Ris the gas constant. Values of Rare given in Appendix A for several common gases; pandTin Eq. 1.1 are the absolute pressure and absolute tem- perature, respectively; ρis density (mass per unit volume).

CLASSIC VIDEO Fundamentals — Boundary Layers .1.4Basic Equations 5It is obvious that the basic laws with which we shall deal are the same as those used in mechanics and thermodynamics. Our task will be to formulate these laws in suitable forms to solve ﬂuid ﬂow problems and to apply them to a wide variety of situations. We must emphasize that there are, as we shall see, many apparently simple problems in ﬂuid mechanics that cannot be solved analytically. In such cases we mustresort to more complicated numerical solutions and/or results of experimental tests. 1.5 Methods of Analysis The ﬁrst step in solving a problem is to deﬁne the system that you are attempting to analyze. In basic mechanics, we made extensive use of the free-body diagram . We willExample 1.1 FIRST LAW APPLICATION TO CLOSED SYSTEM A piston-cylinder device contains 0.95 kg of oxygen initially at a temperature of 27/C14C and a pressure due to the weight of 150 kPa (abs). Heat is added to the gas until it reaches a temperature of 627/C14C. Determine the amount of heat added during the process. Given: Piston-cylinder containing O 2,m50.95 kg.

These concepts are identical to the ones you used in thermodynamics (except you may have called them closed system andopen system , respectively). We can use either one to get mathematical expressions for each of the basic laws. In thermodynamicsthey were mostly used to obtain expressions for conservation of mass and the ﬁrstand second laws of thermodynamics; in our study of ﬂuid mechanics, we will bemost interested in conservation of mass and Newton’s second law of motion. Inthermodynamics our focus was energy; in ﬂuid mechanics it will mainly be forcesand motion. We must always be aware of whether we are using a system or acontrol volume approach because each leads to different mathematical expressionsof these laws. At this point we review the deﬁnitions of systems and control volumes. System and Control Volume Asystem is deﬁned as a ﬁxed, identiﬁable quantity of mass; the system boundaries separate the system from the surroundings. The boundaries of the system may be ﬁxed or movable; however, no mass crosses the system boundaries. In the familiar piston-cylinder assembly from thermodynamics, Fig. 1.2 , the gas in the cylinder is the system. If the gas is heated, the piston will lift the weight; theboundary of the system thus moves. Heat and work may cross the boundaries ofthe system, but the quantity of matter within the system boundaries remains ﬁxed.No mass crosses the system boundaries. In mechanics courses you used the free-body diagram (system approach) exten- sively. This was logical because you were dealing with an easily identiﬁable rigid body.However, in ﬂuid mechanics we normally are concerned with the ﬂow of ﬂuids through devices such as compressors, turbines, pipelines, nozzles, and so on. In these cases it is difﬁcult to focus attention on a ﬁxed identiﬁable quantity of mass. It is muchmore convenient, for analysis, to focus attention on a volume in space through whichthe ﬂuid ﬂows. Consequently, we use the control volume approach. Acontrol volume is an arbitrary volume in space through which ﬂuid ﬂows. The geometric boundary of the control volume is called the control surface. The controlsurface may be real or imaginary; it may be at rest or in motion. Figure 1.3 shows ﬂow through a pipe junction, with a control surface drawn on it. Note that some regions of the surface correspond to physical boundaries (the walls of the pipe) and others (at locations /C131,/C132 , and /C133 ) are parts of the surface that are imaginary (inlets or outlets). For the control volume deﬁned by this surface, we could write equations for the basiclaws and obtain results such as the ﬂow rate at outlet /C133 given the ﬂow rates at inlet /C131GasWeightPiston CylinderSystem boundary Fig. 1.2 Piston-cylinder assembly. Control volumeControl surface 1 23 Fig. 1.3 Fluid ﬂow through a pipe junction.1.5Methods of Analysis 7and outlet /C132 (similar to a problem we will analyze in Example 4.1 in Chapter 4), the force required to hold the junction in place, and so on. It is always important to take care in selecting a control volume, as the choice has a big effect on the mathematicalform of the basic laws. We will illustrate the use of a control volume with an example. Differential versus Integral Approach The basic laws that we apply in our study of ﬂuid mechanics can be formulated interms of inﬁnitesimal orﬁnite systems and control volumes. As you might suspect, the equations will look different in the two cases. Both approaches are importantin the study of ﬂuid mechanics and both will be developed in the course of our work. In the ﬁrst case the resulting equations are differential equations. Solution of the differential equations of motion provides a means of determining the detailedbehavior of the ﬂow. An example might be the pressure distribution on a wing surface.Example 1.2 MASS CONSERVATION APPLIED TO CONTROL VOLUME A reducing water pipe section has an inlet diameter of 50 mm and exit diameter of 30 mm. If the steady inlet speed(averaged across the inlet area) is 2.5 m/s, ﬁnd the exit speed. Given: Pipe, inlet D i550 mm, exit De530 mm. Inlet speed, Vi52.5 m/s. Find: Exit speed, Ve. Solution: Assumption: Water is incompressible (density ρ5constant). The physical law we use here is the conservation of mass, which you learned in thermodynamics when studying turbines, boilers, and so on. You may have seen mass ﬂow at an inlet or outlet expressed as either/C1m5VA=vor /C1m5ρVAwhere V,A,v, and ρare the speed, area, speciﬁc volume, and density, respectively. We will use the density form of the equation. Hence the mass ﬂow is: /C1m5ρVA Applying mass conservation, from our study of thermodynamics, ρViAi5ρVeAe (Note: ρi5ρe5ρby our ﬁrst assumption.)

We often are interested in the gross behavior of a device; in such cases it is more appropriate to use integral formulations of the basic laws. An example might be the overall lift a wing produces. Integral formulations, using ﬁnite systems or control volumes, usually are easier to treat analytically. The basic laws of mechanics andthermodynamics, formulated in terms of ﬁnite systems, are the basis for deriving thecontrol volume equations in Chapter 4. Methods of Description Mechanics deals almost exclusively with systems; you have made extensive use of thebasic equations applied to a ﬁxed, identiﬁable quantity of mass. On the other hand,attempting to analyze thermodynamic devices, you often found it necessary to use acontrol volume (open system) analysis. Clearly, the type of analysis depends on the problem. Where it is easy to keep track of identiﬁable elements of mass (e.g., in particle mechanics), we use a method of description that follows the particle. This sometimes is referred to as the Lagrangian method of description. Consider, for example, the application of Newton’s second law to a particle of ﬁxed mass. Mathematically, we can write Newton’s second law for a system of mass mas Σ~F5m~a5m d~V dt5md2~r dt2ð1:2Þ In Eq. 1.2 ,Σ~Fis the sum of all external forces acting on the system, ~ais the accel- eration of the center of mass of the system, ~Vis the velocity of the center of mass of the system, and ~ris the position vector of the center of mass of the system relative to a ﬁxed coordinate system. Example 1.3 FREE FALL OF BALL IN AIR The air resistance (drag force) on a 200 g ball in free ﬂight is given by FD5231024V2, where FDis in newtons and Vis in meters per second. If the ball is dropped from rest 500 m above the ground, determine the speed at which it hits the ground. What percentage of the terminal speed is the result? (The terminal speed is the steady speed a falling body eventually attains.) Given: Ball, m50.2 kg, released from rest at y05500 m. Air resistance, FD5kV2, where k5231024N/C1s2/m2. Units: FD(N),V(m/s). Find: (a) Speed at which the ball hits the ground. (b) Ratio of speed to terminal speed. Solution: Governing equation: Σ~F5m~a Assumption: Neglect buoyancy force. The motion of the ball is governed by the equation ΣFy5may5mdV dtFD xyy0mg1.5Methods of Analysis 9We could use this Lagrangian approach to analyze a ﬂuid ﬂow by assuming the ﬂuid to be composed of a very large number of particles whose motion must be described. However, keeping track of the motion of each ﬂuid particle would become a horren- dous bookkeeping problem. Consequently, a particle description becomes unmanage- able. Often we ﬁnd it convenient to use a different type of description. Particularly withcontrol volume analyses, it is convenient to use the ﬁeld, or Eulerian ,m e t h o do f description, which focuses attention on the properties of a ﬂow at a given point in spaceas a function of time. In the Eulerian method of description, the properties of a ﬂowﬁeld are described as functions of space coordinates and time. We shall see in Chapter 2that this method of description is a logical outgrowth of the assumption that ﬂuids maybe treated as continuous media.Since V5V(y), we write ΣFy5mdV dydy dt5mVdV dyThen, ΣFy5FD2mg5kV22mg5mVdV dy Separating variables and integrating, Zy y0dy5ZV 0mVdV kV22mg y2y05m 2klnðkV22mgÞ2 435V 05m 2klnkV22mg 2mg Taking antilogarithms, we obtain kV22mg52mg e½ð2k=mÞðy2y0Þ/C138 Solving for Vgives V5mg k/C16 12e½ð2k=mÞðy2y0Þ/C138/C17 no1=2 Substituting numerical values with y50 yields V5 0:2k g39:81m s23m2 231024N/C1s23N/C1s2 kg/C1m12e½23231024=0:2ð2500Þ/C138/C16/C178 < :9 = ; V578:7m=sßV At terminal speed, ay50 and ΣFy505kV2 t2mg: Then, Vt5hmg ki1=2 5" 0:2k g39:81m s23m2 231024N/C1s23N/C1s2 kg/C1m#1=2 599:0m =s The ratio of actual speed to terminal speed is V Vt578:7 99:050:795;or 79 :5%ßV VtThis problem: üReviewed themethodsusedinpar-ticlemechanics.üIntroducedavariableaerodynamicdragforce. TrytheExce lworkbookforthisExampleforvariationsonthisprob lem.10 Chapter 1Introduction1.6 Dimensions and Units Engineering problems are solved to answer speciﬁc questions. It goes without saying that the answer must include units. In 1999, NASA’s Mars Climate Observer crashed because the JPL engineers assumed that a measurement was in meters, but the sup-plying company’s engineers had actually made the measurement in feet! Conse-quently, it is appropriate to present a brief review of dimensions and units. We say“review” because the topic is familiar from your earlier work in mechanics. We refer to physical quantities such as length, time, mass, and temperature as dimensions . In terms of a particular system of dimensions, all measurable quantities are subdivided into two groups— primary quantities and secondary quantities. We refer to a small group of dimensions from which all others can be formed as primaryquantities, for which we set up arbitrary scales of measure. Secondary quantities arethose quantities whose dimensions are expressible in terms of the dimensions of theprimary quantities. Units are the arbitrary names (and magnitudes) assigned to the primary dimensions adopted as standards for measurement. For example, the primary dimension of lengthmay be measured in units of meters, feet, yards, or miles. These units of length arerelated to each other through unit conversion factors (1 mile 55280 feet 51609 meters). Systems of Dimensions Any valid equation that relates physical quantities must be dimensionally homo-geneous; each term in the equation must have the same dimensions. We recognize that Newton’s second law ( ~F~m~a) relates the four dimensions, F,M,L, and t. Thus force and mass cannot both be selected as primary dimensions without introducing a constant of proportionality that has dimensions (and units). Length and time are primary dimensions in all dimensional systems in common use. In some systems, mass is taken as a primary dimension. In others, force is selected as aprimary dimension; a third system chooses both force and mass as primary dimen-sions. Thus we have three basic systems of dimensions, corresponding to the differentways of specifying the primary dimensions. a.Mass [ M], length [ L], time [ t], temperature [ T] b.Force [ F], length [ L], time [ t], temperature [ T] c.Force [ F], mass [ M], length [ L], time [ t], temperature [ T] In system a,f o r c e[ F] is a secondary dimension and the constant of proportionality in Newton’s second law is dimensionless. In system b,m a s s[ M] is a secondary dimension, and again the constant of proportionality in Newton’s second law is dimensionless. Insystem c,b o t hf o r c e[ F] and mass [ M] have been selected as primary dimensions. In this case the constant of proportionality, g c(not to be confused with g, the acceleration of gravity!) in Newton’s second law (written ~F5m~a/gc) is not dimensionless. The dimensions of gcmust in fact be [ ML/Ft2] for the equation to be dimensionally homogeneous. The numerical value of the constant of proportionality depends on theunits of measure chosen for each of the primary quantities. Systems of Units There is more than one way to select the unit of measure for each primary dimension.We shall present only the more common engineering systems of units for each of thebasic systems of dimensions. Table 1.1 shows the basic units assigned to the primary dimensions for these systems. The units in parentheses are those assigned to that unit1.6Dimensions and Units 11system’s secondary dimension. Following the table is a brief description of each of them. a. MLtT SI, which is the ofﬁcial abbreviation in all languages for the Syste `me International d’Unit ´es,1is an extension and reﬁnement of the traditional metric system. More than 30 countries have declared it to be the only legally accepted system. In the SI system of units, the unit of mass is the kilogram (kg), the unit of length is the meter (m), the unit of time is the second (s), and the unit of temperature is the kelvin (K). Force is a secondary dimension, and its unit, the newton (N), is deﬁnedfrom Newton’s second law as 1N/C171kg/C1m=s 2 In the Absolute Metric system of units, the unit of mass is the gram, the unit of length is the centimeter, the unit of time is the second, and the unit of temperature isthe kelvin. Since force is a secondary dimension, the unit of force, the dyne, is deﬁned in terms of Newton’s second law as 1 dyne /C171g/C1cm=s 2 b. FLtT In the British Gravitational system of units, the unit of force is the pound (lbf), the unit of length is the foot (ft), the unit of time is the second, and the unit of tem-perature is the degree Rankine ( /C14R). Since mass is a secondary dimension, the unit of mass, the slug, is deﬁned in terms of Newton’s second law as 1 slug /C171 lbf/C1s2=ft c. FMLtT In the English Engineering system of units, the unit of force is the pound force (lbf),the unit of mass is the pound mass (lbm), the unit of length is the foot, the unit of timeis the second, and the unit of temperature is the degree Rankine. Since both force andmass are chosen as primary dimensions, Newton’s second law is written as ~F5 m~a gcTable 1.1 Common Unit Systems System of Dimensions Unit System Force F Mass M Length L Time tTemperature T a.

CLASSIC VIDEO Fluid Quantity and Flow .12 Chapter 1IntroductionA force of one pound (1 lbf) is the force that gives a pound mass (1 lbm) an accel- eration equal to the standard acceleration of gravity on Earth, 32.2 ft/s2. From Newton’s second law we see that 1 lbf/C171 lbm332:2f t=s2 gc or gc/C1732:2f t/C1lbm =ðlbf/C1s2Þ The constant of proportionality, gc, has both dimensions and units. The dimensions arose because we selected both force and mass as primary dimensions; the units (andthe numerical value) are a consequence of our choices for the standards ofmeasurement. Since a force of 1 lbf accelerates 1 lbm at 32.2 ft/s 2, it would accelerate 32.2 lbm at 1 ft/s2. A slug also is accelerated at 1 ft/s2by a force of 1 lbf. Therefore, 1 slug /C1732:2 lbm Many textbooks and references use lb instead of lbf or lbm, leaving it up to the reader to determine from the context whether a force or mass is being referred to . Preferred Systems of Units In this text we shall use both the SIand the British Gravitational systems of units. In either case, the constant of proportionality in Newton’s second law is dimensionlessand has a value of unity. Consequently, Newton’s second law is written as ~F5m~a.I n these systems, it follows that the gravitational force (the “weight” 2) on an object of mass mis given by W5mg. SI units and preﬁxes, together with other deﬁned units and useful conversion factors, are summarized in Appendix G. Example 1.4 USE OF UNITS The label on a jar of peanut butter states its net weight is 510 g. Express its mass and weight in SI, BG, and EE units. Given: Peanut butter “weight,” m5510 g. Find: Mass and weight in SI, BG, and EE units. Solution: This problem involves unit conversions and use of the equation relating weight and mass: W5mg The given “weight” is actually the mass because it is expressed in units of mass: mSI50:510 kg ßmSI Using the conversions of Table G.2 (Appendix G), mEE5mSI1 lbm 0:454 kg/C18/C19 50:510 kg1 lbm 0:454 kg/C18/C19 51:12 lbm ßmEE 2Note that in the English Engineering system, the weight of an object is given by W5mg/g c.1.6Dimensions and Units 13Dimensional Consistency and “Engineering” Equations In engineering, we strive to make equations and formulas have consistent dimensions. That is, each term in an equation, and obviously both sides of the equation, should bereducible to the same dimensions. For example, a very important equation we will derive later on is the Bernoulli equation p1 ρ1V2 1 21gz15p2 ρ1V2 2 21gz2 which relates the pressure p, velocity V, and elevation zbetween points 1 and 2 along a streamline for a steady, frictionless incompressible ﬂow (density ρ). This equation is dimensionally consistent because each term in the equation can be reduced to dimensions of L2/t2(the pressure term dimensions are FL/M, but from Newton’s law we ﬁnd F5M/Lt2,s oFL/M5ML2/Mt25L2/t2). Almost all equations you are likely to encounter will be dimensionally consistent. However, you should be alert to some still commonly used equations that are not; theseare often “engineering” equations derived many years ago, or are empirical (based on experiment rather than theory), or are proprietary equations used in a particular industry or company. For example, civil engineers often use the semi-empirical Manning equation V5R2=3 hS1=2 0 nUsing the fact that 1 slug 532.2 lbm, mBG5mEE1 slug 32:2 lbm0 @1A51:12 lbm 1 slug 32:2 lbm0@1A 50:0349 slug ßmBG To ﬁnd the weight, we use W5mg In SI units, and using the deﬁnition of a newton, WSI50:510 kg39:81m s255:00kg/C1m s20@1A N kg/C1m=s20@1A 55:00 N ßWSI In BG units, and using the deﬁnition of a slug, WBG50:0349 slug 332:2ft s251:12slug/C1ft s2 51:12slug/C1ft s20 @1A s2/C1lbf=ft slug0@1A51:12 lbf ßWBG In EE units, we use the form W5mg/gc, and using the deﬁnition of gc, WEE51:12 lbm 332:2ft s231 gc536:1 gclbm/C1ft s2 536:1lbm/C1ft s2/C18/C19lbf/C1s2 32:2f t/C1lbm/C18/C19 51:12 lbf ßWEEThis problemillustrates: üConversionsfromSItoBGand EEsystems.üUse ofgcintheEEsystem.

The value of this constant depends on the surface condition of the channel. For example, for a canal made from unﬁnished concrete, most references give n/C250.014. Unfor- tunately, the equation is dimensionally inconsistent! For the right side of the equation,R hhas dimensions L, and S0is dimensionless, so with a dimensionless constant n,w e end up with dimensions of L2/3; for the left side of the equation the dimensions must beL/t! A user of the equation is supposed to know that the values of nprovided in most references will give correct results only if we ignore the dimensional incon- sistency, always use Rhin meters, and interpret Vto be in m/s! (The alert student will realize that this means that even though handbooks provide nvalues as just constants, they must have units of s/m1/3.) Because the equation is dimensionally inconsistent, using the same value for nwith Rhin ft does notgive the correct value for Vin ft/s. A second type of problem is one in which the dimensions of an equation are consistent but use of units is not. The commonly used EER of an air conditioner is EER5cooling rate electrical input which indicates how efﬁciently the AC works—a higher EER value indicates better performance. The equation isdimensionally consistent, with the EER being dimen- sionless (the cooling rate and electrical input are both measured in energy/time).However, it is used, in a sense, incorrectly, because the units traditionally used in it are not consistent. For example, a good EER value is 10, which would appear to imply you receive, say, 10 kW of cooling for each 1 kW of electrical power. In fact, an EER of 10 means you receive 10 Btu/hr of cooling for each 1 Wof electrical power! Manu- facturers, retailers, and customers all use the EER , in a sense, incorrectly in that they quote an EER of, say, 10, rather than the correct way, of 10 Btu/hr/W. (The EER ,a s used, is an everyday, inconsistent unit version of the coefﬁcient of performance, COP , studied in thermodynamics.) The two examples above illustra te the dangers in using certain equations. Almost all the equations encountered in this text will be dimensionally consistent, but you should be awareof the occasional troublesome equation you will encounter in your engineering studies. As a ﬁnal note on units, we stated earlier that we will use SI and BG units in this text. You will become very familiar with their use through using this text but shouldbe aware that many of the units used, although they are scientiﬁcally and engineering- wise correct, are nevertheless not units you will use in everyday activities, and vice versa; we do not recommend asking your grocer to give you, say, 22 newtons, or 0.16slugs, of potatoes; nor should you be expected to immediately know what, say, a motoroil viscosity of 5W20 means! SI units and preﬁxes, other deﬁned units, and useful conversions are given in Appendix G. 1.7 Analysis of Experimental Error Most consumers are unaware of it but, as with most foodstuffs, soft drink containersare ﬁlled to plus or minus a certain amount, as allowed by law. Because it is difﬁcult toprecisely measure the ﬁlling of a container in a rapid production process, a 12-ﬂ-ozcontainer may actually contain 12.1, or 12.7, ﬂ oz. The manufacturer is never supposedto supply less than the speciﬁed amount; and it will reduce proﬁts if it is unnecessarily generous. Similarly, the supplier of components for the interior of a car must satisfy minimum and maximum dimensions (each component has what are calledtolerances) so that the ﬁnal appearance of the interior is visually appealing. Engineersperforming experiments must measure not just data but also the uncertainties in their1.7Analysis of Experimental Error 15measurements. They must also somehow determine how these uncertainties affect the uncertainty in the ﬁnal result. All of these examples illustrate the importance of experimental uncertainty , that is, the study of uncertainties in measurements and their effect on overall results. Thereis always a trade-off in experimental work or in manufacturing: We can reduce theuncertainties to a desired level, but the smaller the uncertainty (the more precisethe measurement or experiment), the more expensive the procedure will be. Fur-thermore, in a complex manufacture or experiment, it is not always easy to see whichmeasurement uncertainty has the biggest inﬂuence on the ﬁnal outcome. Anyone involved in manufacturing, or in experimental work, should understand experimental uncertainties. Appendix F has details on this topic; there is a selection of problems on this topic at the end of this chapter. Case Study “Fly Like a Bird” The airplane with various instantaneous wing shapes. (Courtesy of Dr. Rick Lind, University of Florida.) At the end of each chapter, we present a case study: an interesting development in ﬂuid mechanics chosento illustrate that the ﬁeld is constantly evolving.No airplane, or airplane model, ﬂies like a bird; air- craft all have ﬁxed wings when in ﬂight, whereas birds are (almost) constantly ﬂapping away! One reason for this is that airplane and model wings must supportrelatively signiﬁcant weight and are therefore thick andstiff; another reason is that we don’t yet fully under-stand bird ﬂight! Engineers at the University of Floridain Gainesville, led by researcher Rick Lind, have goneback to the drawing board and have developed asmall surveillance aircraft (2-ft wingspan, weight a total of 1 1/2lb) that can change its wing shape during ﬂight. While it is not true bird ﬂight (the main propul- sion is through a propeller), it is a radical departurefrom current airplane design. The airplane can change,for example, from an M shape wing conﬁguration (verystable for gliding) to a W shape (for high maneuver-ability). It is amazingly dexterous: It can turn three rollsin less than a second (comparable to an F-15 ﬁghter!), and its ﬂight is sufﬁciently birdlike that it has attracted sparrows (friendly) and crows (unfriendly). Possibleuses are in military surveillance, detection of biologicalagents in congested urban areas, and environmentalstudies in difﬁcult airspaces such as forests.1.8Summary In this chapter we introduced or reviewed a number of basic concepts and deﬁnitions, including: üHow ﬂuids are deﬁned, and the no-slip condition üSystem/control volume concepts üLagrangian and Eulerian descriptions üUnits and dimensions (including SI, British Gravitational, and English Engineering systems) üExperimental uncertainty16 Chapter 1IntroductionProblems Deﬁnition of a Fluid: Basic Equations 1.1A number of common substances are Tar Sand “Silly Putty” Jello Modeling clay Toothpaste Wax Shaving cream Some of these materials exhibit characteristics of both solid and ﬂuid behavior under different conditions.

Express the distance required to reach 95 percent of its terminalspeed in percent terms of g,k, and W. 1.9 A cylindrical tank must be designed to contain 5 kg of compressed nitrogen at a pressure of 200 atm (gage) and 20/C14C. The design constraints are that the length must be twice the diameter and the wall thickness must be 0.5 cm. What are the external dimensions? 1.10 In a combustion process, gasoline particles are to be dropped in air at 200/C14F. The particles must drop at least 10 in. in 1 s. Find the diameter dof droplets required for this. (The drag on these particles is given by FD5πμVd , where V is the particle speed and μis the air viscosity. To solve this problem, use Excel’s Goal Seek.) 1.11 For a small particle of styrofoam (1 lbm/ft3) (spherical, with diameter d50.3 mm) falling in standard air at speed V, the drag is given by FD53πμVd, where μis the air viscosity.

Plot the speed of the sky diver as a function of time and as a function of distance fallen. 1.15 For Problem 1.14, the initial horizontal speed of the sky diver is 70 m/s.

(As in the U.S. customary system, where 1 lbf isthe force exerted by a mass of 1 lbm in standard gravity, 1 kgfis the force exerted by a mass of 1 kg in standard gravity.)

The solar energy storage is initially thermal in nature, asthe water surface is heated during the day. When thewater cools overnight, thermal gradients are createdthat ultimately lead to ocean currents (as well as winds)containing huge amounts of energy. According to a 2009 U.S. Department of Energy study titled “Ocean Energy Technology,” there are four types of oceanenergy conversion: wave energy, tidal energy, marine current energy ,a n d ocean thermal energy conversion . The total power from waves believed to be available is about 2.7 TW, of which it is currently practical toextract 500 GW (500 310 9W). Bear in mind that we mentioned in Chapter 1 that total power consumption by humans was about 16 TW (as of 2006), so at bestwave power could supply about 3 percent of humanneeds using current technology. These devices work byeither ﬂoating on the surface of the ocean or by beingmoored to the ocean ﬂoor. Many of these devices relyon buoyancy forces, which we will discuss in Chapter 3. For example, a device that ﬂoats on the surface may have joints hinged together that bend with the waves; thisbending motion pumps ﬂuid through turbines and cre-ates electric power. Alternatively, stationary tethereddevices use pressure ﬂuctuations produced in longtubes from the waves swelling up and down; the bob-bing motion drives a turbine. Wave energy is already 20In Chapter 1 we discussed in general terms what ﬂuid mechanics is about, and described some of the approaches we will use in analyzing ﬂuid mechanics problems.In this chapter we will be more speciﬁc in deﬁning some important properties of ﬂuidsand ways in which ﬂows can be described and characterized. 2.1 Fluid as a Continuum We are all familiar with ﬂuids—the most common being air and water—and we experience them as being “smooth,” i.e., as being a continuous medium. Unless we usereaching fairly advanced levels of development, with a number of companies being involved. Tidal energy uses the 12-hr cycle due to the grav- itational force of the moon; the difference in waterheight from low to high tide is an extractable form ofpotential energy. For example, water can be capturedby using a barrier across an estuary during high tide and by forcing the water through a turbine during low tide. Alternatively, as shown in the ﬁgure, turbine sys-tems could be mounted in such a way that they swingwith the tide, extracting energy when the tide comes inand goes out. There are only about 20 locations onearth with tides sufﬁciently high to make tidal energypractical. The Bay of Fundy between Maine and NovaScotia features the highest tides in the world, reaching 17 m (56 ft). This area alone could produce up to 15 GW of power. The total wave energy power believed to beavailable is about 2.5 TW, of which, with current tech-nology, it is practical to extract only about 65 GW. Marine current energy is that due to ocean currents (which in turn are generated by solar heating and bythe winds—ultimately solar in origin—as well as by theEarth’s rotation). About 5 TW of power is believed to be available, of which it is currently practical to extract 450 GW; at best, this energy source will supply somethingless than 5 percent of total current needs. In the UnitedStates, it is most abundant off the coast of Florida in theﬂow known as the Gulf Stream. Kinetic energy can becaptured from the Gulf Stream and other currents withsubmerged turbines that are very similar in appearanceto miniature wind turbines. As with wind turbines, the continuous movement of the marine current moves the rotor blades to generate electric power. Turbineswill be discussed in some detail in Chapter 10. Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), uses the ocean temperature difference between surface waterand that at depths lower than 1000 m to extractenergy. The temperature of ocean water at a depth of1000 m is just above freezing; a temperature differ- ence of as little as 20 /C14C (36/C14F) can yield usable energy. (You can ﬁgure out the minimum surfacetemperature required!) The warm surface water can be used as a heat source to evaporate a ﬂuid such asammonia, which can drive a turbine, and the deep water acts as a heat sink. Because of the temperatures involved, such devices will have a very low theoreticalefﬁciency, but the amount of stored thermal energy ishuge—about 200 TW of power! Yet another form of ocean energy (ultimately traceable to solar energy) is that due to the variabilityof salinity due to water evaporation. When salty oceanwater (brine) is separated from fresh water by a semipermeable membrane, a pressure gradient builds up across the membrane (osmotic pressure). We willlearn in this text that a pressure gradient can be usedas a driving force for energy generation. The exploi-tation of this energy is called salinity gradient energy conversion. This is a future technology with hugepotential. There is about 1000 TW of energy available,or about 60 times total worldwide power usage! We shall discuss some interesting developments in several of these energy conversion methods in Case Studies in Energy and the Environment in subsequent chapters. Proposed tidal turbines.2.1Fluid as a Continuum 21specialized equipment, we are not aware of the underlying molecular nature of ﬂuids. This molecular structure is one in which the mass is notcontinuously distributed in space, but is concentrated in molecules that are separated by relatively large regionsof empty space. The sketch in Fig. 2.1 ashows a schematic representation of this. A region of space “ﬁlled” by a stationary ﬂuid (e.g., air, treated as a single gas) looks like a continuous medium, but if we zoom in on a very small cube of it, we can see that we mostly have empty space, with gas molecules scattered around, moving at high speed(indicated by the gas temperature). Note that the size of the gas molecules is greatlyexaggerated (they would be almost invisible even at this scale) and that we haveplaced velocity vectors only on a small sample. We wish to ask: What is the minimumvolume, δV---u, that a “point” Cmust be, so that we can talk about continuous ﬂuid properties such as the density at a point? In other words, under what circumstancescan a ﬂuid be treated as a continuum , for which, by deﬁnition, properties vary smoothly from point to point? This is an important question because the concept of acontinuum is the basis of classical ﬂuid mechanics. Consider how we determine the density at a point. Density is deﬁned as mass per unit volume; in Fig. 2.1 athe mass δmwill be given by the instantaneous number of molecules in δV---(and the mass of each molecule), so the average density in volume δV--- is given by ρ5δm=δV---. We say “average” because the number of molecules in δV---, and hence the density, ﬂuctuates. For example, if the gas in Fig. 2.1 awas air at standard temperature and pressure (STP 1) and the volume δV---was a sphere of dia- meter 0.01 μm, there might be 15 molecules in δV---(as shown), but an instant later there might be 17 (three might enter while one leaves). Hence the density at “point” C randomly ﬂuctuates in time, as shown in Fig. 2.1 b. In this ﬁgure, each vertical dashed line represents a speciﬁc chosen volume, δV---, and each data point represents the measured density at an instant. For very small volumes, the density varies greatly, butabove a certain volume, δV---u, the density becomes stable—the volume now encloses a huge number of molecules. For example, if δV---50:001 mm 3(about the size of a grain of sand), there will on average be 2 :531013molecules present. Hence we can con- clude that air at STP (and other gases, and liquids) can be treated as a continuousmedium as long as we consider a “point” to be no smaller than about this size; this issufﬁciently precise for most engineering applications. The concept of a continuum is the basis of classical ﬂuid mechanics. The con- tinuum assumption is valid in treating the behavior of ﬂuids under normal conditions.It only breaks down when the mean free path of the molecules 2becomes the same order of magnitude as the smallest signiﬁcant characteristic dimension of the problem.(a)( b)Cxy“Point” C at x,y,z Volumeof massδV δm δm/δV δVδV' Fig. 2.1 Deﬁnition of density at a point. VIDEO Fluid as a Continuum. 1STP for air are 15/C14C (59/C14F) and 101.3 kPa absolute (14.696 psia), respectively. 2Approximately 6 31028m at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure) for gas molecules that show ideal gas behavior [1].22 Chapter 2Fundamental ConceptsThis occurs in such specialized problems as rareﬁed gas ﬂow (e.g., as encountered in ﬂights into the upper reaches of the atmosphere). For these specialized cases (notcovered in this text) we must abandon the concept of a continuum in favor of the microscopic and statistical points of view. As a consequence of the continuum assumption, each ﬂuid property is assumed to have a deﬁnite value at every point in space. Thus ﬂuid properties such as density, temperature, velocity, and so on are considered to be continuous functions ofposition and time. For example, we now have a workable deﬁnition of density at apoint, ρ/C17lim δV----δV---uδm δV---ð2:1Þ Since point Cwas arbitrary, the density at any other point in the ﬂuid could be determined in the same manner. If density was measured simultaneously at an inﬁnite number of points in the ﬂuid, we would obtain an expression for the density distribution as a function of the space coordinates, ρ5ρðx;y;zÞ, at the given instant. The density at a point may also vary with time (as a result of work done on or by the ﬂuid and/or heat transfer to the ﬂuid). Thus the complete representation of density(theﬁeld representation) is given by ρ5ρðx;y;z;tÞ ð2:2Þ Since density is a scalar quantity, requiring only the speciﬁcation of a magnitude for acomplete description, the ﬁeld represented by Eq. 2.2 is a scalar ﬁeld. An alternative way of expressing the density of a substance (solid or ﬂuid) is to compare it to an accepted reference value, typically the maximum density of water,ρ H2O(1000 kg/m3at 4/C14C or 1.94 slug/ft3at 39/C14F). Thus, the speciﬁc gravity , SG, of a substance is expressed as SG5ρ ρH2Oð2:3Þ For example, the SG of mercury is typically 13.6—mercury is 13.6 times as dense aswater. Appendix A contains speciﬁc gravity data for selected engineering materials.The speciﬁc gravity of liquids is a function of temperature; for most liquids speciﬁc gravity decreases with increasing temperature. The speciﬁc weight ,γ, of a substance is another useful material property. It is deﬁned as the weight of a substance per unit volume and given as γ5mg V----γ5ρg ð2:4Þ For example, the speciﬁc weight of water is approximately 9.81 kN/m3(62.4 lbf/ft3). 2.2 Velocity Field In the previous section we saw that the continuum assumption led directly to the notion of the density ﬁeld. Other ﬂuid properties also may be described by ﬁelds. A very important property deﬁned by a ﬁeld is the velocity ﬁeld, given by ~V5~Vðx;y;z;tÞ ð2:5Þ Velocity is a vector quantity, requiring a magnitude and direction for a completedescription, so the velocity ﬁeld (Eq. 2.5) is a vector ﬁeld.2.2 Velocity Field 23The velocity vector, V~, also can be written in terms of its three scalar components. Denoting the components in the x,y, and zdirections by u,v, and w, then ~V5u^i1v^j1w^k ð2:6Þ In general, each component, u,v, and w, will be a function of x,y,z, and t. We need to be clear on what ~Vðx;y;z;tÞmeasures: It indicates the velocity of a ﬂuid particle that is passing through the point x,y,zat time instant t, in the Eulerian sense. We can keep measuring the velocity at the same point or choose any other point x,y,z at the next time instant; the point x,y,zisnotthe ongoing position of an individual particle, but a point we choose to look at. (Hence x,y,a n dz are independent variables. In Chapter 5 we will discuss the material derivative of velocity, in which we choose x5xpðtÞ;y5ypðtÞ;andz5zpðtÞ, where xp(t),yp(t),zp(t)isthe position of a speciﬁc particle.) We conclude that ~Vðx;y;z;tÞshould be thought of as the velocity ﬁeld of all particles, not just the velocity of an individual particle. If properties at every point in a ﬂow ﬁeld do not change with time, the ﬂow is termed steady . Stated mathematically, the deﬁnition of steady ﬂow is @η @t50 where ηrepresents any ﬂuid property. Hence, for steady ﬂow, @ρ @t50o r ρ5ρðx;y;zÞ and @~V @t50o r ~V5~Vðx;y;zÞ In steady ﬂow, any property may vary from point to point in the ﬁeld, but all prop- erties remain constant with time at every point. One-, Two-, and Three-Dimensional Flows A ﬂow is classiﬁed as one-, two-, or three-dimensional depending on the number ofspace coordinates required to specify the velocity ﬁeld. 3Equation 2.5 indicates that the velocity ﬁeld may be a function of three space coordinates and time. Such a ﬂowﬁeld is termed three-dimensional (it is also unsteady ) because the velocity at any point in the ﬂow ﬁeld depends on the three coordinates required to locate the point in space. Although most ﬂow ﬁelds are inherently three-dimensional, analysis based on fewer dimensions is frequently meaningful. Consider, for example, the steady ﬂowthrough a long straight pipe that has a divergent section, as shown in Fig. 2.2 . In this example, we are using cylindrical coordinates ( r,θ,x). We will learn (in Chapter 8) that under certain circumstances (e.g., far from the entrance of the pipe and from thedivergent section, where the ﬂow can be quite complicated), the velocity distributionmay be described by u5u max12r R/C16/C172/C20/C21 ð2:7Þ This is shown on the left of Fig. 2.2 . The velocity u(r) is a function of only one coordinate, and so the ﬂow is one-dimensional. On the other hand, in the diverging 3Some authors choose to classify a ﬂow as one-, two-, or three-dimensional on the basis of the number of space coordinates required to specify allﬂuid properties. In this text, classiﬁcation of ﬂow ﬁelds will be based on the number of space coordinates required to specify the velocity ﬁeld only.24 Chapter 2Fundamental Conceptssection, the velocity decreases in the xdirection, and the ﬂow becomes two-dimensional: u5u(r,x). As you might suspect, the complexity of analysis increases considerably with the number of dimensions of the ﬂow ﬁeld. For many problems encountered in engi- neering, a one-dimensional analysis is adequate to provide approximate solutions ofengineering accuracy. Since all ﬂuids satisfying the continuum assumption must have zero relative velocity at a solid surface (to satisfy the no-slip condition), most ﬂows are inherently two-or three-dimensional. To simplify the analysis it is often convenient to use the notionofuniform ﬂow at a given cross section. In a ﬂow that is uniform at a given cross section, the velocity is constant across any section normal to the ﬂow. Under this assumption, 4the two-dimensional ﬂow of Fig. 2.2 is modeled as the ﬂow shown in Fig. 2.3. In the ﬂow of Fig. 2.3, the velocity ﬁeld is a function of xalone, and thus the ﬂow model is one-dimensional. (Other properties, such as density or pressure, also may be assumed uniform at a section, if appropriate.) The term uniform ﬂow ﬁeld (as opposed to uniform ﬂow at a cross section) is used to describe a ﬂow in which the velocity is constant, i.e., independent of all spacecoordinates, throughout the entire ﬂow ﬁeld. Timelines, Pathlines, Streaklines, and Streamlines Airplane and auto companies and college engineering laboratories, among others,frequently use wind tunnels to visualize ﬂow ﬁelds [2]. For example, Fig. 2.4 shows a ﬂow pattern for ﬂow around a car mounted in a wind tunnel, generated by releasingsmoke into the ﬂow at ﬁve ﬁxed upstream points. Flow patterns can be visualizedusing timelines, pathlines, streaklines, or streamlines. If a number of adjacent ﬂuid particles in a ﬂow ﬁeld are marked at a given instant, they form a line in the ﬂuid at that instant; this line is called a timeline . Subsequent observa- tions of the line may provide information about the ﬂow ﬁeld. For example, in discussingthe behavior of a ﬂuid under the action of a constant shear force (Section 1.2) timelineswere introduced to demonstrate the deformation of a ﬂuid at successive instants. Apathline is the path or trajectory traced out by a moving ﬂuid particle. To make a pathline visible, we might identify a ﬂuid particle at a given instant, e.g., by the use ofdye or smoke, and then take a long exposure photograph of its subsequent motion. The line traced out by the particle is a pathline. This approach might be used to study, for example, the trajectory of a contaminant leaving a smokestack. On the other hand, we might choose to focus our attention on a ﬁxed location in space and identify, again by the use of dye or smoke, all ﬂuid particles passing throughthis point. After a short period of time we would have a number of identiﬁable ﬂuidu(r)r xRr θ u(r,x)umax Fig. 2.2 Examples of one- and two-dimensional ﬂows. x Fig. 2.3 Example of uniform ﬂow at a section. 4This may seem like an unrealistic simpliﬁcation, but actually in many cases leads to useful results. Sweeping assumptions such as uniform ﬂow at a cross section should always be reviewed carefully to be sure they provide a reasonable analytical model of the real ﬂow. CLASSIC VIDEO Flow Visualization . VIDEO Streaklines . 2.2 Velocity Field 25particles in the ﬂow, all of which had, at some time, passed through one ﬁxed location in space. The line joining these ﬂuid particles is deﬁned as a streakline. Streamlines are lines drawn in the ﬂow ﬁeld so that at a given instant they are tangent to the direction of ﬂow at every point in the ﬂow ﬁeld. Since the streamlinesare tangent to the velocity vector at every point in the ﬂow ﬁeld, there can be no ﬂow across a streamline. Streamlines are the most commonly used visualization technique. For example, they are used to study ﬂow over an automobile in a computer simula-tion. The procedure used to obtain the equation for a streamline in two-dimensionalﬂow is illustrated in Example 2.1. In steady ﬂow, the velocity at each point in the ﬂow ﬁeld remains constant with time and, consequently, the streamline shapes do not vary from one instant to thenext. This implies that a particle located on a given streamline will always move alongthe same streamline. Furthermore, consecutive particles passing through a ﬁxed point in space will be on the same streamline and, subsequently, will remain on this streamline. Thus in a steady ﬂow, pathlines, streaklines, and streamlines are identicallines in the ﬂow ﬁeld. Figure 2.4 shows a photograph of ﬁve streaklines for ﬂow over an automobile in a wind tunnel. A streakline is the line produced in a ﬂow when all particles moving through aﬁxed point are marked in some way (e.g., using smoke). We can also deﬁne streamlines . These are lines drawn in the ﬂow ﬁeld so that at a given instant they are tangent to the direction of ﬂow at every point in the ﬂow ﬁeld. Since the streamlines are tangent to the velocity vector at every point in the ﬂow ﬁeld, there is no ﬂow across a streamline. Pathlines are as the name implies: They show, over time, the paths individual particles take (if you’ve seen time-lapse photos of nighttime trafﬁc, you get the idea). Finally,timelines are created by marking a line in a ﬂow and watching how it evolves over time. We mentioned that Fig. 2.4 shows streaklines, but in fact the pattern shown also represents streamlines and pathlines! The steady pattern shown will exist as long assmoke is released from the ﬁve ﬁxed points. If we were somehow to measure thevelocity at all points at an instant, to generate streamlines, we’d get the same pattern; if we were instead to release only one smoke particle at each location, and video its motion over time, we’d see the particles follow the same curves. We conclude that forsteady ﬂow, streaklines, streamlines, and pathlines are identical. Fig. 2.4 Streaklines over an automobile in a wind tunnel. (Courtesy Audi AG.) VIDEO Streamlines . 26 Chapter 2Fundamental ConceptsThings are quite different for unsteady ﬂow. For unsteady ﬂow, streaklines, streamlines, and pathlines will in general have differing shapes. For example, consider holding a garden hose and swinging it side to side as water exits at high speed, as shown in Fig. 2.5 . We obtain a continuous sheet of water. If we consider individual water particles, we see that each particle, once ejected, follows a straight-line path (here, for simplicity, we ignore gravity): The pathlines are straight lines, as shown. Onthe other hand, if we start injecting dye into the water as it exits the hose, we willgenerate a streakline, and this takes the shape of an expanding sine wave, as shown. Clearly, pathlines and streaklines do not coincide for this unsteady ﬂow (we leave determination of streamlines to an exercise). We can use the velocity ﬁeld to derive the shapes of streaklines, pathlines, and streamlines. Starting with streamlines: Because the streamlines are parallel to thevelocity vector, we can write (for 2D) dy dx/C19 streamline5vðx;yÞ uðx;yÞð2:8Þ Note that streamlines are obtained at an instant in time; if the ﬂow is unsteady, time t is held constant in Eq. 2.8. Solution of this equation gives the equation y5yðxÞ, with an undetermined integration constant, the value of which determines the particular streamline. For pathlines (again considering 2D), we let x5xpðtÞandy5ypðtÞ, where xp(t) andyp(t) are the instantaneous coordinates of a speciﬁc particle. We then get dx dt/C19 particle5uðx;y;tÞdy dt/C19 particle5vðx;y;tÞ ð2:9Þ The simultaneous solution of these equations gives the path of a particle in parametricform x p(t),yp(t). The computation of streaklines is somewhat tricky. The ﬁrst step is to compute the pathline of a particle (using Eqs. 2.9) that was released from the streak source point(coordinates x 0,y0) at time t0, in the form xparticle ðtÞ5xðt;x0;y0;t0Þ yparticle ðtÞ5yðt;x0;y0;t0Þ Then, instead of interpreting this as the position of a particle over time, we rewritethese equations as x streakline ðt0Þ5xðt;x0;y0;t0Þ ystreakline ðt0Þ5yðt;x0;y0;t0Þ ð2:10Þ Equations 2.10 give the line generated (by time t) from a streak source at point (x0,y0). In these equations, t0(the release times of particles) is varied from 0 to tto show the instantaneous positions of all particles released up to time t!Pathlines of individual fluid particles Streakline at some instantStreakline at a later instant Fig. 2.5 Pathlines and streaklines for ﬂow from the exit of an oscillating garden hose.

Each ﬂuid particle can experience: surface forces (pressure, friction) that are generated by contact with other particles or a solid surface; and body forces (such as gravity and electromagnetic) that are experienced throughout the particle. The gravitational body force acting on an element of volume, dV---, is given by ρ~gdV---, where ρis the density (mass per unit volume) and ~gis the local gravitational accel- eration. Thus the gravitational body force per unit volume is ρ~gand the gravitational body force per unit mass is ~g. Surface forces on a ﬂuid particle lead to stresses . The concept of stress is useful for describing how forces acting on the boundaries of a medium (ﬂuid or solid) aretransmitted throughout the medium. You have probably seen stresses discussed insolid mechanics. For example, when you stand on a diving board, stresses are gener- ated within the board. On the other hand, when a body moves through a ﬂuid, stresses are developed within the ﬂuid. The difference between a ﬂuid and a solid is, as we’veseen, that stresses in a ﬂuid are mostly generated by motion rather than by deﬂection. Imagine the surface of a ﬂuid particle in contact with other ﬂuid particles, and consider the contact force being generated between the particles. Consider a portion,δ~A, of the surface at some point C. The orientation of δ~Ais given by the unit vector, ˆn, shown in Fig. 2.6 . The vector ˆnis the outwardly drawn unit normal with respect to the particle. The force, δ~F, acting on δ~Amay be resolved into two components, one normal to and the other tangent to the area.

In dealing with vector quantities such as force, we usually consider components in an orthogonal coordinate system. In rectangular coordinates we might consider thestresses acting on planes whose outwardly drawn normals (again with respect tothe material acted upon) are in the x,y,o rzdirections. In Fig. 2.7 we consider the stress on the element δA x, whose outwardly drawn normal is in the xdirection. The force, δ~F, has been resolved into components along each of the coordinate directions. Dividingthe magnitude of each force component by the area, δA x, and taking the limit as δAx approaches zero, we deﬁne the three stress components shown in Fig. 2.7 b: σxx5lim δAx-0δFx δAx τxy5lim δAx-0δFy δAxτxz5lim δAx-0δFz δAxð2:13Þ We have used a double subscript notation to label the stresses. The ﬁrstsubscript (in this case, x) indicates the plane on which the stress acts (in this case, a surface perpendicular to the xaxis). The second subscript indicates the direction in which the stress acts. Consideration of area element δAywould lead to the deﬁnitions of the stresses, σyy, τyx,a n dτ yz; use of area element δAzwould similarly lead to the deﬁnitions of σzz,τzx,τzy. Although we just looked at three orthogonal planes, an inﬁnite number of planes can be passed through point C, resulting in an inﬁnite number of stresses associated with planes through that point. Fortunately, the state of stress at a point can be describedcompletely by specifying the stresses acting on anythree mutually perpendicular planes through the point. The stress at a point is speciﬁed by the nine components σ xxτxyτxz τyxσyyτyz τzxτzyσzz2 435 where σhas been used to denote a normal stress, and τto denote a shear stress.

In order to designate the plane of interest, we could use terms like front and back, top and bottom, or left and right. However, it is more logical to name the planes in termsof the coordinate axes. The planes are named and denoted as positive or negativeaccording to the direction of the outwardly drawn normal to the plane. Thus the topplane, for example, is a positive yplane and the back plane is a negative zplane. It also is necessary to adopt a sign convention for stress. A stress component is positive when the direction of the stress component and the plane on which it acts are both positive or both negative. Thus τ yx55 lbf =in:2represents a shear stress on a positive yplane in the positive xdirection or a shear stress on a negative yplane in the negative xdirection. In Fig. 2.8 all stresses have been drawn as positive stresses. Stress components are negative when the direction of the stress component and the plane on which it acts are of opposite sign. 2.4 Viscosity Where do stresses come from? For a solid, stresses develop when the material iselastically deformed or strained; for a ﬂuid, shear stresses arise due to viscous ﬂow (we will discuss a ﬂuid’s normal stresses shortly). Hence we say solids are elastic , and ﬂuids areviscous (and it’s interesting to note that many biological tissues are viscoelastic , meaning they combine features of a solid and a ﬂuid). For a ﬂuid at rest, there will be no shear stresses. We will see that each ﬂuid can be categorized by examining therelation between the applied shear stresses and the ﬂow (speciﬁcally the rate ofdeformation) of the ﬂuid. Consider the behavior of a ﬂuid element between the two inﬁnite plates shown in Fig. 2.9 a. The rectangular ﬂuid element is initially at rest at time t. Let us now suppose a constant rightward force δF xis applied to the upper plate so that it is dragged across the ﬂuid at constant velocity δu. The relative shearing action of the inﬁnite plates produces a shear stress, τyx, which acts on the ﬂuid element and is given byσyy τyx τyz τzy τzx σzzτxy σxxτxz σyyτyxτyzx zy τzyτzxσzz τxyσxxτxz Fig. 2.8 Notation for stress.2.4 Viscosity 31τyx5lim δAy-0δFx δAy5dFx dAy where δAyis the area of contact of the ﬂuid element with the plate and δFxis the force exerted by the plate on that element. Snapshots of the ﬂuid element, shown in Figs. 2.9a/C0c, illustrate the deformation of the ﬂuid element from position MNOP at time t, toMuNOP uat time t1δt,t oMvNOPv at time t12δt, due to the imposed shear stress. As mentioned in Section 1.2, it is the fact that a ﬂuid continually deforms in responseto an applied shear stress that sets it apart from solids. Focusing on the time interval δt(Fig. 2.9 b), the deformation of the ﬂuid is given by deformation rate 5lim δt-0δα δt5dα dt We want to express dα/dtin terms of readily measurable quantities. This can be done easily. The distance, δl, between the points MandMuis given by δl5δuδt Alternatively, for small angles, δl5δyδα Equating these two expressions for δlgives δα δt5δu δy Taking the limits of both sides of the equality, we obtain dα dt5du dy Thus, the ﬂuid element of Fig. 2.9 , when subjected to shear stress τyx, experiences a rate of deformation ( shear rate ) given by du/dy . We have established that any ﬂuid that experiences a shear stress will ﬂow (it will have a shear rate). What is the relationbetween shear stress and shear rate? Fluids in which shear stress is directly propor- tional to rate of deformation are Newtonian ﬂuids . The term non-Newtonian is used to classify all ﬂuids in which shear stress is not directly proportional to shear rate. Newtonian Fluid Most common ﬂuids (the ones discussed in this text) such as water, air, and gasolineare Newtonian under normal conditions. If the ﬂuid of Fig. 2.9 is Newtonian, then τ yx~du dyð2:14Þ We are familiar with the fact that some ﬂuids resist motion more than others. For example, a container of SAE 30W oil is much harder to stir than one of water.Hence SAE 30W oil is much more viscous—it has a higher viscosity.

Thus in terms of the coordinates of Fig. 2.9 , Newton’s law of viscosity is given for one-dimensional ﬂow by τyx5μdu dyð2:15Þ Note that, since the dimensions of τare [F/L2] and the dimensions of du/dyare [1/ t],μhas dimensions [ Ft/L2]. Since the dimensions of force, F, mass, M, length, L, and time, t, are related by Newton’s second law of motion, the dimensions of μcan also be expressed as [M/Lt]. In the British Gravitational system, the units of viscosity are lbf /C1s/ft2or slug/ (ft/C1s). In the Absolute Metric system, the basic unit of viscosity is called a poise [1 poise /C17 1g / ( c m /C1s)]; in the SI system the units of viscosity are kg/(m /C1s) or Pa /C1s( 1 P a /C1s5 1N/C1s/m2). The calculation of viscous shear stress is illustrated in Example 2.2. In ﬂuid mechanics the ratio of absolute viscosity, μ, to density, ρ, often arises. This ratio is given the name kinematic viscosity and is represented by the symbol ν. Since density has dimensions [ M/L3], the dimensions of νare [L2/t]. In the Absolute Metric system of units, the unit for νis a stoke (1 stoke /C171c m2/s). Viscosity data for a number of common Newtonian ﬂuids are given in Appendix A. Note that for gases, viscosity increases with temperature, whereas for liquids, viscosity decreases with increasing temperature.

Although we will not discuss these much in this text, many common ﬂuids exhibit non-Newtonian behavior. Two familiar examples are toothpaste and Lucite5 paint. The latter is very “thick” when in the can, but becomes “thin” when sheared bybrushing. Toothpaste behaves as a “ﬂuid” when squeezed from the tube. However, it does not run out by itself when the cap is removed. There is a threshold or yield stress below which toothpaste behaves as a solid. Strictly speaking, our deﬁnition of a ﬂuid isvalid only for materials that have zero yield stress. Non-Newtonian ﬂuids commonlyare classiﬁed as having time-independent or time-dependent behavior. Examples oftime-independent behavior are shown in the rheological diagram of Fig. 2.10. Numerous empirical equations have been proposed [3, 4] to model the observed relations between τ yxanddu/dy for time-independent ﬂuids.

I. du Pont de Nemours & Company.34 Chapter 2Fundamental Conceptsrepresented for many engineering applications by the power law model, which for one-dimensional ﬂow becomes τyx5kdu dy/C18/C19n ð2:16Þ where the exponent, n, is called the ﬂow behavior index and the coefﬁcient, k,t h ec o n - sistency index. This equation reduces to Newton’s law of viscosity for n51w i t h k5μ. To ensure that τyxhas the same sign as du/dy , Eq. 2.16 is rewritten in the form τyx5kdu dy/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12n21du dy5ηdu dyð2:17Þ The term η5kjdu=dyjn21is referred to as the apparent viscosity . The idea behind Eq. 2.17 is that we end up with a viscosity ηthat is used in a formula that is the same form as Eq. 2.15, in which the Newtonian viscosity μis used. The big difference is that while μis constant (except for temperature effects), ηdepends on the shear rate. Most non- Newtonian ﬂuids have apparent viscosities that are relatively high compared with the viscosity of water. Fluids in which the apparent viscosity decreases with increasing deformation rate (n,1) are called pseudoplastic (or shear thinning) ﬂuids. Most non-Newtonian ﬂuids fall into this group; examples include polymer solutions, colloidal suspensions, and paper pulp in water. If the apparent viscosity increases with increasing deformation rate(n.1) the ﬂuid is termed dilatant (or shear thickening). Suspensions of starch and of sand are examples of dilatant ﬂuids. You can get an idea of the latter when you’re onthe beach—if you walk slowly (and hence generate a low shear rate) on very wet sand, you sink into it, but if you jog on it (generating a high shear rate), it’s very ﬁrm. A “ﬂuid” that behaves as a solid until a minimum yield stress, τ y, is exceeded and subsequently exhibits a linear relation between stress and rate of deformation is referred to as an ideal or Bingham plastic . The corresponding shear stress model is τyx5τy1μpdu dyð2:18Þ Clay suspensions, drilling muds, and toothpaste are examples of substances exhibitingthis behavior. The study of non-Newtonian ﬂuids is further complicated by the fact that the apparent viscosity may be time-dependent. Thixotropic ﬂuids show a decrease in η with time under a constant applied shear stress; many paints are thixotropic. Rheo- pectic ﬂuids show an increase in ηwith time. After deformation some ﬂuids partially return to their original shape when the applied stress is released; such ﬂuids are calledviscoelastic (many biological ﬂuids work this way).Bingham plastic PseudoplasticPseudoplastic Dilatant Dilatant Newtonian Newtonian Deformation rate,du___ dyDeformation rate,du___ dy (a)( b)Shear stress,τ Apparent viscosity,η Fig. 2.10 (a) Shear stress, τ, and (b) apparent viscosity, η, as a function of deformation rate for one-dimensional ﬂow of various non-Newtonian ﬂuids. CLASSIC VIDEO Rheological Behavior of Fluids .2.4 Viscosity 352.5 Surface Tension You can tell when your car needs waxing: Water droplets tend to appear somewhat ﬂattened out. After waxing, you get a nice “beading” effect. These two cases are shown in Fig. 2.11 . We deﬁne a liquid as “wetting” a surface when the contact angle θ,90/C14. By this deﬁnition, the car’s surface was wetted before waxing, and not wetted after. This is an example of effects due to surface tension . Whenever a liquid is in contact with other liquids or gases, or in this case a gas/solid surface, an inter-face develops that acts like a stretched elastic membrane, creating surface tension.There are two features to this membrane: the contact angle, θ, and the magnitude of the surface tension, σ(N/m or lbf/ft). Both of these depend on the type of liquid and the type of solid surface (or other liquid or gas) with which it shares an interface.In the car-waxing example, the contact angle changed from being smaller than 90 /C14,t o larger than 90/C14, because, in effect, the waxing changed the nature of the solid surface. Factors that affect the contact angle include the cleanliness of the surface and thepurity of the liquid. Other examples of surface tension effects arise when you are able to place a needle on a water surface and, similarly, when small water insects are able to walk on thesurface of the water. Appendix A contains data for surface tension and contact angle for common liquids in the presence of air and of water. A force balance on a segment of interface s hows that there is a pressure jump across the imagined elastic membrane whenever the interface is curved. For a water droplet in air,pressure in the water is higher than ambient; the same is true for a gas bubble in liquid. Fora soap bubble in air, surface tension acts on both inside and outside in terfaces between the soap ﬁlm and air along the curved bubble sur face. Surface tension also leads to the phenomena of capillary (i.e., very small wavelength) waves on a liquid surface [5], and capillary rise or depression, discussed below in Example 2.3. In engineering, probably the most important effect of surface tension is the creation of ac u r v e d meniscus that appears in manometers or barometers, leading to a (usually unwanted) capillary rise (or depression), as shown in Fig. 2.12 . This rise may be pro- nounced if the liquid is in a small-diameter tube or narrow gap, as shown in Example 2.3.

(2.54 mm). Over a diameter range 0.1 ,D,1.1 in., experimental data for the capillary rise with a water-air interface are correlated by the empirical expression Δh50.400/ e4.37D. Manometer and barometer readings should be made at the level of the middle of the meniscus. This is away from the maximum effects of surface tension and thusnearest to the proper liquid level. All surface tension data in Appendix A were measured for pure liquids in contact with clean vertical surfaces. Impurities in the liquid, dirt on the surface, or surfaceinclination can cause an indistinct meniscus; under such conditions it may be difﬁcultto determine liquid level accurately. Liquid level is most distinct in a vertical tube. When inclined tubes are used to increase manometer sensitivity (see Section 3.3) it is important to make each reading at the same point on the meniscus and to avoid use oftubes inclined less than about 15 /C14from horizontal. Surfactant compounds reduce surface tension signiﬁcantly (more than 40% with little change in other properties [7]) when added to water. They have wide commercialapplication: Most detergents contain surfactants to help water penetrate and lift soilfrom surfaces. Surfactants also have major industrial applications in catalysis, aero-sols, and oil ﬁeld recovery. 2.6 Description and Classi ﬁcation of Fluid Motions In Chapter 1 and in this chapter, we have almost completed our brief introduction tosome concepts and ideas that are often needed when studying ﬂuid mechanics. Before beginning detailed analysis of ﬂuid mechanics in the rest of this text, we will describe some interesting examples to illustrate a broad classiﬁcation of ﬂuid mechanics on the basis ofimportant ﬂow characteristics. Fluid mechanics is a huge discipline: It covers everythingfrom the aerodynamics of a supersonic transport vehicle to the lubrication of human jointsby sinovial ﬂuid. We need to break ﬂuid mechanics down into manageable proportions. Itturns out that the two most difﬁcult aspects o f a ﬂuid mechanics analysis to deal with are: (1) the ﬂuid’s viscous nature and (2) its compressibility. In fact, the area of ﬂuid mechanicstheory that ﬁrst became highly developed (ab out 250 years ago!) was that dealing with a frictionless, incompressible ﬂuid. As we will see shortly (and in more detail later on), thistheory, while extremely elegant, led to the famous result called d’Alembert’s paradox: Allbodies experience no drag as they move through such a ﬂuid—a result not exactly con-sistent with any real behavior! Although not the only way to do so, most engineers subdivide ﬂuid mechanics in terms of whether or not viscous effects and compressibility effects are present, asshown in Fig. 2.13 . Also shown are classiﬁcations in terms of whether a ﬂow is laminar or turbulent, and internal or external. We will now discuss each of these. Viscous and Inviscid Flows When you send a ball ﬂying through the air (as in a game of baseball, soccer, or anynumber of other sports), in addition to gravity the ball experiences the aerodynamicdrag of the air. The question arises: What is the nature of the drag force of the air onthe ball? At ﬁrst glance, we might conclude that it’s due to friction of the air as it ﬂowsover the ball; a little more reﬂection might lead to the conclusion that because air hassuch a low viscosity, friction might not contribute much to the drag, and the dragmight be due to the pressure build-up in front of the ball as it pushes the air out of the way. The question arises: Can we predict ahead of time the relative importance of the viscous force, and force due to the pressure build-up in front of the ball? Can wemake similar predictions for anyobject, for example, an automobile, a submarine, a VIDEO Capillary Rise . CLASSIC VIDEO Surface Tension in Fluid Mechanics . VIDEO Examples of Flow over a Sphere . 38 Chapter 2Fundamental Conceptsred blood cell, moving through anyﬂuid, for example, air, water, blood plasma? The answer (which we’ll discuss in much more detail in Chapter 7) is that we can! It turns out that we can estimate whether or not viscous forces, as opposed to pressure forces, are negligible by simply computing the Reynolds number Re5ρVL μ where ρandμare the ﬂuid density and viscosity, respectively, and VandLare the typical or “characteristic” velocity and size scale of the ﬂow (in this example the ballvelocity and diameter), respectively. If the Reynolds number is “large,” viscous effectswill be negligible (but will still have important consequences, as we’ll soon see), atleast in most of the ﬂow; if the Reynolds number is small, viscous effects will bedominant. Finally, if the Reynolds number is neither large nor small, no generalconclusions can be drawn. To illustrate this very powerful idea, consider two simple examples. First, the drag on your ball: Suppose you kick a soccer ball (diameter 58.75 in.) so it moves at 60 mph. The Reynolds number (using air properties from Table A.10) for this case isabout 400,000—by any measure a large number; hence the drag on the soccer ballis almost entirely due to the pressure build-up in front of it. For our second example,consider a dust particle (modeled as a sphere of diameter 1 mm) falling under gravityat a terminal velocity of 1 cm/s: In this case Re/C250.7—a quite small number; hence the drag is mostly due to the friction of the air. Of course, in both of these examples, if we wish to determine the drag force, we would have to do substantially more analysis. These examples illustrate an important point: A ﬂow is considered to be friction dominated (or not) based not just on the ﬂuid’s viscosity, but on the complete ﬂow system. In these examples, the airﬂow was low friction for the soccer ball, but was highfriction for the dust particle. Let’s return for a moment to the idealized notion of frictionless ﬂow, called inviscid ﬂow . This is the branch shown on the left in Fig. 2.13 . This branch encom- passes most aerodynamics, and among other things explains, for example, why sub- and supersonic aircraft have differing shapes, how a wing generates lift, and so forth. If this theory is applied to the ball ﬂying through the air (a ﬂow that is also incom-pressible), it predicts streamlines (in coordinates attached to the sphere) as shown inFig. 2.14 a.Continuum fluid mechanics Laminar Turbulent External Internal Incompressible CompressibleInviscid = 0μViscous Fig. 2.13 Possible classiﬁcation of continuum ﬂuid mechanics.

CLASSIC VIDEO Fundamentals—Boundary Layers .2.6 Description and Classiﬁcation of Fluid Motions 39The streamlines are symmetric front-to-back. Because the mass ﬂow between any two streamlines is constant, wherever streamlines open up, the velocity must decrease, and vice versa. Hence we can see that the velocity in the vicinity of points AandC must be relatively low; at point Bit will be high. In fact, the air comes to rest at points AandC: They are stagnation points . It turns out that (as we’ll learn in Chapter 6) the pressure in this ﬂow is high wherever the velocity is low, and vice versa. Hence, points A andChave relatively large (and equal) pressures; point Bwill be a point of low pressure. In fact, the pressure distribution on the sphere is symmetric front-to-back, and there isno net drag force due to pressure. Because we’re assuming inviscid ﬂow, there can be no drag due to friction either. Hence we have d’Alembert’s paradox of 1752: The ball experiences no drag! This is obviously unrealistic. On the other hand, everything seems logically con- sistent: We established that Refor the sphere was very large (400,000), indicating friction is negligible. We then used inviscid ﬂow theory to obtain our no-drag result.How can we reconcile this theory with reality? It took about 150 years after theparadox ﬁrst appeared for the answer, obtained by Prandtl in 1904: The no-slip con-dition (Section 1.2) requires that the velocity everywhere on the surface of the sphere be zero (in sphere coordinates), but inviscid theory states that it’s high at point B. Prandtl suggested that even though friction is negligible in general for high- Reynolds number ﬂows, there will always be a thin boundary layer , in which friction is signiﬁcant and across the width of which the velocity increases rapidly from zero (at thesurface) to the value inviscid ﬂow theory predicts (on the outer edge of the boundarylayer). This is shown in Fig. 2.14 bfrom point Ato point B, and in more detail in Fig. 2.15. This boundary layer immediately allows us to reconcile theory and experiment: Once we have friction in a boundary layer we will have drag. However, this boundarylayer has another important consequence: It often leads to bodies having a wake ,a s shown in Fig. 2.14 bfrom point Donwards. Point Dis aseparation point , where ﬂuid particles are pushed off the object and cause a wake to develop. Consider once againthe original inviscid ﬂow (Fig. 2.14 a): As a particle moves along the surface from point BtoC, it moves from low to high pressure. This adverse pressure gradient (a pressure change opposing ﬂuid motion) causes the particles to slow down as they move alongthe rear of the sphere. If we now add to this the fact that the particles are moving in a boundary layer with friction that also slows down the ﬂuid, the particles will even- tually be brought to rest and then pushed off the sphere by the following particles,forming the wake. This is generally very bad news: It turns out that the wake willalways be relatively low pressure, but the front of the sphere will still have relativelyhigh pressure. Hence, the sphere will now have a quite large pressure drag (orform drag—so called because it’s due to the shape of the object). This description reconciles the inviscid ﬂow no-drag result with the experimental result of signiﬁcant drag on a sphere. It’s interesting to note that although the boundary layer is necessary to explain the drag on the sphere, the drag is actually dueAB Cy x (a) Inviscid flowBD Ay x (b) Viscous flowPoint of separation Wake Fig. 2.14 Qualitative picture of incompressible ﬂow over a sphere.

VIDEO Boundary Layer Flow . 40 Chapter 2Fundamental Conceptsmostly to the asymmetric pressure distribution created by the boundary layer separation—drag directly due to friction is still negligible! We can also now begin to see how streamlining of a body works. The drag force in most aerodynamics is due to the low-pressure wake: If we can reduce or eliminate thewake, drag will be greatly reduced. If we consider once again why the separationoccurred, we recall two features: Boundary layer friction slowed down the particles,but so did the adverse pressure gradient. The pressure increased very rapidly acrossthe back half of the sphere in Fig. 2.14 abecause the streamlines opened up so rapidly. If we make the sphere teardrop shaped, as in Fig. 2.16, the streamlines open upgradually, and hence the pressure will increase slowly, to such an extent that ﬂuid particles are not forced to separate from the object until they almost reach the end of the object, as shown. The wake is much smaller (and it turns out the pressure will not be as low as before), leading to much less pressure drag. The only negative aspect of this streamlining is that the total surface area on which friction occurs is larger, so drag due to friction will increase a little. We should point out that none of this discussion applies to the example of a falling dust particle: This low-Reynolds number ﬂow was viscous throughout—there is no inviscid region. Finally, this discussion illustrates the very signiﬁcant difference between inviscid ﬂow ( μ50) and ﬂows in which viscosity is negligible but not zero ( μ-0). Laminar and Turbulent Flows If you turn on a faucet (that doesn’t have an aerator or other attachment) at a very low ﬂow rate the water will ﬂow out very smoothly—almost “glass-like.” If you increase the ﬂow rate, the water will exit in a churned-up, chaotic manner. These are examples ofhow a viscous ﬂow can be laminar or turbulent, respectively. A laminar ﬂow is one in which the ﬂuid particles move in smooth layers, or laminas; a turbulent ﬂow is one in which the ﬂuid particles rapidly mix as they move along due to random three-dimensional velocity ﬂuctuations. Typical examples of pathlines of each of these areillustrated in Fig. 2.17 , which shows a one-dimensional ﬂow. In most ﬂuid mechanics problems—for example, ﬂow of water in a pipe—turbulence is an unwanted but often unavoidable phenomenon, because it generates more resistance to ﬂow; in other problems—for example, the ﬂow of blood through blood vessels—it is desirable becausethe random mixing allows all of the blood cells to contact the walls of the blood vessels toexchange oxygen and other nutrients. The velocity of the laminar ﬂow is simply u; the velocity of the turbulent ﬂow is given by the mean velocity ¯uplus the three components of randomly ﬂuctuating velocity uu,vu, and wu. Although many turbulent ﬂows of interest are steady in the mean ( ¯uis not a function of time), the presence of the random, high-frequency velocity ﬂuctuationsmakes the analysis of turbulent ﬂows extremely difﬁcult. In a one-dimensional laminarﬂow, the shear stress is related to the velocity gradient by the simple relation τ yx5μdu dyð2:15ÞBoundary layer Point of separationWake Fig. 2.16 Flow over a streamlined object. xy z = ui = (u + u') i + v'j + w'kLaminar Turbulent^ ^^ ^ Fig. 2.17 Particle pathlines in one-dimensional laminar and turbulent ﬂows.

VIDEO Laminar and Turbulent Flow . 2.6 Description and Classiﬁcation of Fluid Motions 41For a turbulent ﬂow in which the mean velocity ﬁeld is one-dimensional, no such simple relation is valid. Random, three-dimensional velocity ﬂuctuations ( uu,vu, and wu) transport momentum across the mean ﬂow streamlines, increasing the effective shear stress. (This apparent stress is discussed in more detail in Chapter 8.) Conse- quently, in turbulent ﬂow there is no universal relationship between the stress ﬁeldand the mean-velocity ﬁeld. Thus in turbulent ﬂows we must rely heavily on semi-empirical theories and on experimental data. Compressible and Incompressible Flows Flows in which variations in density are negligible are termed incompressible ; when density variations within a ﬂow are not negligible, the ﬂow is called compressible . The most common example of compressible ﬂow concerns the ﬂow of gases, while the ﬂowof liquids may frequently be treated as incompressible. For many liquids, density is only a weak function of temperature. At modest pressures, liquids may be considered incompressible. However, at high pressures,compressibility effects in liquids can be important. Pressure and density changes inliquids are related by the bulk compressibility modulus, or modulus of elasticity, E v/C17dp ðdρ=ρÞð2:19Þ If the bulk modulus is independent of temperature, then density is only a function ofpressure (the ﬂuid is barotropic). Bulk modulus data for some common liquids are given in Appendix A. Water hammer and cavitation are examples of the importance of compressibility effects in liquid ﬂows. Water hammer is caused by acoustic waves propagating and reﬂecting in a conﬁned liquid, for example, when a valve is closed abruptly. Theresulting noise can be similar to “hammering” on the pipes, hence the term. Cavitation occurs when vapor pockets form in a liquid ﬂow because of local reductions in pressure (for example at the tip of a boat’s propeller blades). Dependingon the number and distribution of particles in the liquid to which very small pockets ofundissolved gas or air may attach, the local pressure at the onset of cavitation may beat or below the vapor pressure of the liquid. These particles act as nucleation sites toinitiate vaporization. Vapor pressure of a liquid is the partial pressure of the vapor in contact with the saturated liquid at a given temperature. When pressure in a liquid is reduced to less than the vapor pressure, the liquid may change phase suddenly and “ﬂash” to vapor. The vapor pockets in a liquid ﬂow may alter the geometry of the ﬂow ﬁeld sub- stantially. When adjacent to a surface, the growth and collapse of vapor bubbles can cause serious damage by eroding the surface material. Very pure liquids can sustain large negative pressures—as much as 260 atmo- spheres for distilled water—before the liquid “ruptures” and vaporization occurs.Undissolved air is invariably present near the free surface of water or seawater, socavitation occurs where the local total pressure is quite close to the vapor pressure. It turns out that gas ﬂows with negligible heat transfer also may be considered incompressible provided that the ﬂow speeds are small relative to the speed of sound;the ratio of the ﬂow speed, V, to the local speed of sound, c, in the gas is deﬁned as the Mach number, M/C17 V c ForM,0.3, the maximum density variation is less than 5 percent. Thus gas ﬂows with M,0.3 can be treated as incompressible; a value of M50.3 in air at standard condi- tions corresponds to a speed of approximately 100 m/s. For example, although it might CLASSIC VIDEO Cavitation .42 Chapter 2Fundamental Conceptsbe a little counterintuitive, when you drive your car at 65 mph the air ﬂowing around it has negligible change in density. As we shall see in Chapter 12, the speed of sound in anideal gas is given by c5ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ kRTp ,w h e r ek is the ratio of speciﬁc heats, Ris the gas constant, andTis the absolute temperature.

In addition, Appendix A contains some useful data on atmospheric properties, such as temperature, at various elevations.Compressible ﬂows occur frequently in engineering applications. Common examplesinclude compressed air systems used to power shop tools and dental drills, trans-mission of gases in pipelines at high pressure, and pneumatic or ﬂuidic control andsensing systems. Compressibility effects are very important in the design of modern high-speed aircraft and missiles, power plants, fans, and compressors. Internal and External Flows Flows completely bounded by solid surfaces are called internal orduct ﬂows . Flows over bodies immersed in an unbounded ﬂuid are termed external ﬂows . Both internal and external ﬂows may be laminar or turbulent, compressible or incompressible. We mentioned an example of internal ﬂow when we discussed the ﬂow out of a faucet—the ﬂow in the pipe leading to the faucet is an internal ﬂow. It turns out that we have a Reynolds number for pipe ﬂows deﬁned as Re5ρVD=μ, where Vis the average ﬂow velocity and Dis the pipe diameter (note that we do notuse the pipe length!). This Reynolds number indicates whether a pipe ﬂow will be laminar orturbulent. Flow will generally be laminar for Re#2300 and turbulent for larger values: Flow in a pipe of constant diameter will be entirely laminar or entirely tur-bulent, depending on the value of the velocity V. We will explore internal ﬂows in detail in Chapter 8. We already saw some examples of external ﬂows when we discussed the ﬂow over a sphere (Fig. 2.14 b) and a streamlined object (Fig. 2.16). What we didn’t mention was that these ﬂows could be laminar or turbulent. In addition, we mentioned boundary layers (Fig. 2.15): It turns out these also can be laminar or turbulent. When we discuss these in detail (Chapter 9), we’ll start with the simplest kind of boundary layer—thatover a ﬂat plate—and learn that just as we have a Reynolds number for the overallexternal ﬂow that indicates the relative signiﬁcance of viscous forces, there will also bea boundary-layer Reynolds number Re x5ρUNx=μwhere in this case the char- acteristic velocity UNis the velocity immediately outside the boundary layer and the characteristic length xis the distance along the plate. Hence, at the leading edge of the plate Rex50, and at the end of a plate of length L, it will be Rex5ρUNL/μ. The signiﬁcance of this Reynolds number is that (as we’ll learn) the boundary layer will belaminar for Re x#53105and turbulent for larger values: A boundary layer will start out laminar, and if the plate is long enough the boundary layer will transition tobecome turbulent. It is clear by now that computing a Reynolds number is often very informative for both internal and external ﬂows. We will discuss this and other important dimen- sionless groups (such as the Mach number) in Chapter 7. The internal ﬂow through ﬂuid machines is considered in Chapter 10. The principle of angular momentum is applied to develop fundamental equations for ﬂuid machines.Pumps, fans, blowers, compressors, and propellers that add energy to ﬂuid streams areconsidered, as are turbines and windmills that extract energy. The chapter featuresdetailed discussion of operation of ﬂuid systems. The internal ﬂow of liquids in which the duct does not ﬂow full—where there is a free surface subject to a constant pressure—is termed open-channel ﬂow. Common examples of open-channel ﬂow include ﬂow in rivers, irrigation ditches, and aque-ducts. Open-channel ﬂow will be treated in Chapter 11. VIDEO Compressible Flow: Shock Waves . 2.6 Description and Classiﬁcation of Fluid Motions 43Both internal and external ﬂows can be compressible or incompressible. Com- pressible ﬂows can be divided into subs onic and supersonic regimes. We will study compressible ﬂows in Chapters 12 and 13 and see among other things that supersonic ﬂows (M.1) will behave very differently than subsonic ﬂows (M,1). For example, supersonic ﬂows can experience oblique and normal shocks, and can also behave in a counterintuitive way—e.g., a supersonic nozzle (a device to accelerate a ﬂow) mustbe divergent (i.e., it has increasing cross-sectional area) in the direction of ﬂow! We note here also that in a subsonic nozzle (wh ich has a convergent cross-sectional area), the pressure of the ﬂow at the exit pl ane will always be the ambient pressure; for a sonic ﬂow, the exit pressure can be higher than ambient; and for a supersonicﬂow the exit pressure can be greater than, equal to, or less than the ambient pressure! 2.7Summary and Useful Equations In this chapter we have completed our review of some of the fundamental concepts we will utilize in our study of ﬂuid mechanics. Some of these are: üHow to describe ﬂows (timelines, pathlines, streamlines, streaklines). üForces (surface, body) and stresses (shear, normal). üTypes of ﬂuids (Newtonian, non-Newtonian—dilatant, pseudoplastic, thixotropic, rheopectic, Bingham plastic) and viscosity (kinematic, dynamic, apparent). üTypes of ﬂow (viscous/inviscid, laminar/turbulent, compressible/incompressible, internal/external). We also brieﬂy discussed some interesting phenomena, such as surface tension, boundary layers, wakes, and streamlining. Finally, we introduced two very useful dimensionless groups—the Reynolds number and the Mach number.

Some people have the impression that ﬂuid mechanics is old- or low-tech: water ﬂow in a household pipe, theﬂuid forces acting on a dam, and so on. While it’s truethat many concepts in ﬂuid mechanics are hundreds ofyears old, there are still lots of exciting new areas ofresearch and development. Everyone has heard of therelatively high-tech area of ﬂuid mechanics called streamlining (of cars, aircraft, racing bikes, and racing swimsuits, to mention a few), but there are manyothers. If you’re a typical engineering student, there’s a decent chance that while reading this chapter you’relistening to music on your MP3 player; you can thankﬂuid mechanics for your ability to do this! The tinyhard disk drive (HDD) in many of these devices typi- cally holds about 250 gigabytes (GB) of data, so the disk platter must have a huge density (greater than100,000 tracks per inch); in addition, the read/writehead must get very close to the platter as it transfers data (typically the head is about 0.05 μm above the platter surface—a human hair is about 100 μm). The platter also spins at something greater than 500 revolutions per second! Hence the bearings in whichthe spindle of the platter spins must have very lowfriction but also have virtually no play or looseness—otherwise, at worst, the head will crash into theplatter or, at best, you won’t be able to read the data (it will be too closely packed). Designing such a bearing presents quite a challenge. Until a few yearsago, most hard drives used ball bearings (BBs), whichare essentially just like those in the wheel of abicycle; they work on the principle that a spindle canrotate if it is held by a ring of small spheres that aresupported in a cage. The problems with BBs are thatthey have a lot of components; they are very difﬁcult to build to the precision needed for the HDD; they are vulnerable to shock (if you drop an HDD with such adrive, you’re likely to dent one of the spheres as ithits the spindle, destroying the bearing); and they arerelatively noisy. Hard-drive makers are increasingly moving to ﬂuid dynamic bearings (FDBs). These are mechanicallymuch simpler than BBs; they consist basically of the spindle directly mounted in the bearing opening, with only a specially formulated viscous lubricant (such asester oil) in the gap of only a few microns. The spindleand/or bearing surfaces have a herringbone pattern ofgrooves to maintain the oil in place. These bearings areextremely durable (they can often survive a shock of500g!) and low noise; they will also allow rotation speeds in excess of 15,000 rpm in the future, making data access even faster than with current devices. FDBs have been used before, in devices such as gyroscopes,but making them at such a small scale is new. SomeFDBs even use pressurized air as the lubrication ﬂuid,but one of the problems with these is that theysometimes stop working when you take them on anairplane ﬂight—the cabin pressure is insufﬁcient tomaintain the pressure the bearing needs! In recent times the price and capacity of ﬂash memory have improved so much that many MP3players are switching to this technology from HDDs.Eventually, notebook and desktop PCs will also switchto ﬂash memory, but at least for the next few yearsHDDs will be the primary storage medium. Your PC willstill have vital ﬂuid-mechanical components!2.7 Summary and Useful Equations 45References 1.Vincenti, W. G., and C. H. Kruger Jr., Introduction to Physical Gas Dynamics.

Description and Classiﬁcation of Fluid Motions 2.82 Water usually is assumed to be incompressible when evaluating static pressure variations. Actually it is 100 timesmore compressible than steel. Assuming the bulk modulus ofwater is constant, compute the percentage change in density for water raised to a gage pressure of 100 atm. Plot the per- centage change in water density as a function of p/p atmup to a pressure of 50,000 psi, which is the approximate pressureused for high-speed cutting jets of water to cut concrete and other composite materials.

Wave power in particularis attractive to a number of countries with access to asuitable resource. Geographically and commerciallyit’s believed the richest wave energy resources cur- rently are off the Atlantic coast of Europe (in particular near Ireland, the UK, and Portugal), the west coast ofNorth America (from San Francisco to British Colum-bia), Hawaii, and New Zealand.A family of devices called point absorbers is being developed by a number of companies. These areusually axisymmetric about a vertical axis, and bydeﬁnition they are small compared to the wavelengthof the waves that they are designed to exploit. Thedevices usually operate in a vertical mode, oftenreferred to as heave; a surface-piercing ﬂoat rises and falls with the passing waves and reacts against either the seabed or something attached to it. These devices ultimately depend on a buoyancy force, one of thetopics of this chapter. A company named Wavebob Ltd. has developed one of the simplest of these devices. This innovative 55In Chapter 1, we deﬁned a ﬂuid as any substance that ﬂows (continuously deforms) when it experiences a shear stress; hence for a static ﬂuid (or one undergoing “rigid- body” motion) only normal stress is present—in other words, pressure. We will studythe topic of ﬂuid statics (often called hydrostatics , even though it is not restricted to water) in this chapter. Although ﬂuid statics problems are the simplest kind of ﬂuid mechanics prob- lems, this is not the only reason we will study them. The pressure generated within astatic ﬂuid is an important phenomenon in many practical situations. Using theprinciples of hydrostatics, we can compute forces on submerged objects, develop instruments for measuring pressures, and deduce properties of the atmosphere and oceans. The principles of hydrostatics also may be used to determine the forcesdeveloped by hydraulic systems in applications such as industrial presses or auto-mobile brakes. In a static, homogeneous ﬂuid, or in a ﬂuid undergoing rigid-body motion, a ﬂuid particle retains its identity for all time, and ﬂuid elements do not deform. We mayapply Newton’s second law of motion to evaluate the forces acting on the particle. 3.1The Basic Equation of Fluid Statics The ﬁrst objective of this chapter is to obtain an equation for computing the pressureﬁeld in a static ﬂuid. We will deduce what we already know from everyday experience,that the pressure increases with depth. To do this, we apply Newton’s second law toa differential ﬂuid element of mass dm5ρdV---, with sides dx,dy,a n ddz , as showneponymous device, as shown in the ﬁgure, is provingto be successful for extracting wave energy. The ﬁguredoes not indicate the size of the device, but it is quitelarge; the upper champer has a diameter of 20 m. Itlooks like just another buoy ﬂoating on the surface,but underneath it is constantly harvesting energy. Thelower component of the Wavebob is tethered to the ocean ﬂoor and so remains in its vertical location,while the section at the surface oscillates as the wavesmove over it. Hence the distance between the twocomponents is constantly changing, with a signiﬁcantforce between them; work can thus be done on anelectrical generator. The two components of themachinery contain electronic systems that can be con-trolled remotely or self-regulating, and these make the internal mechanism automatically react to changing ocean and wave conditions by retuning as needed, sothat at all times the maximum amount of energy isharvested. It has already been tested in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Ireland and is designed to have a 25-yearlife span and to be able to survive all but the veryworst storms. Each Wavebob is expected to produce about 500 kW of power or more, sufﬁcient electricityfor over a thousand homes; it is intended to be part ofa large array of such devices. It seems likely thisdevice will become ubiquitous because it is relatively inexpensive, very low maintenance, and durable, and it takes up only a small area. Schematic of Wavebob (Picture courtesy of Gra ´inne Byrne, Wavebob Ltd.)56 Chapter 3Fluid Staticsin Fig. 3.1 . The ﬂuid element is stationary relative to the stationary rectangular coordinate system shown. (Fluids in rigid-body motion will be treated in Section 3.7 on the Web.) From our previous discussion, recall that two general types of forces may be applied to a ﬂuid: body forces and surface forces. The only body force that must be considered in most engineering problems is due to gravity. In some situations bodyforces caused by electric or magnetic ﬁelds might be present; they will not be con-sidered in this text. For a differential ﬂuid element, the body force is d~F B5~gdm5~gρdV--- where ~gis the local gravity vector, ρis the density, and dV---is the volume of the element. In Cartesian coordinates dV---5dx dy dz ,s o d~FB5ρ~gd xd yd z In a static ﬂuid there are no shear stresses , so the only surface force is the pressure force. Pressure is a scalar ﬁeld, p5p(x,y,z); in general we expect the pressure to vary with position within the ﬂuid. The net pressure force that results from this variation can be found by summing the forces that act on the six faces of the ﬂuidelement. Let the pressure be pat the center, O, of the element. To determine the pressure at each of the six faces of the element, we use a Taylor series expansion of the pressureabout point O. The pressure at the left face of the differential element is p L5p1@p @yðyL2yÞ5p1@p @y2dy 2/C18/C19 5p2@p @ydy 2 (Terms of higher order are omitted because they will vanish in the subsequent limitingprocess.) The pressure on the right face of the differential element is p R5p1@p @yðyR2yÞ5p1@p @ydy 2 The pressure forces acting on the two ysurfaces of the differential element are shown in Fig. 3.1 . Each pressure force is a product of three factors. The ﬁrst is the magnitude of the pressure. This magnitude is multiplied by the area of the face togive the magnitude of the pressure force, and a unit vector is introduced to indicatedirection. Note also in Fig. 3.1 that the pressure force on each face acts against the face. A positive pressure corresponds to a compressive normal stress. Pressure forces on the other faces of the element are obtained in the same way. Combining all such forces gives the net surface force acting on the element.

Note that the pressure magnitude itself is not relevant in computing the net pressure force; instead what counts is the rate of change of pressure with distance, the pressure gradient.

In Eq. 3.6, γis the speciﬁc weight of the ﬂuid. This equation is the basic pressure- height relation of ﬂuid statics. It is subject to the restrictions noted. Therefore it must be applied only where these restrictions are reasonable for the physical situation. To determine the pressure distribution in a static ﬂuid, Eq. 3.6 may be integrated andappropriate boundary conditions applied. Before considering speciﬁc applications of this equation, it is important to remember that pressure values must be stated with respect to a reference level. If thereference level is a vacuum, pressures are termed absolute , as shown in Fig. 3.2 . Most pressure gages indicate a pressure difference —the difference between the measured pressure and the ambient level (usually atmospheric pressure). Pressure levels measured with respect to atmospheric pressure are termed gage pressures.

Absolute pressures must be used in all calculations with the ideal gas equation or other equations of state. 3.2 The Standard Atmosphere Scientists and engineers sometimes need a numerical or analytical model of the Earth’s atmosphere in order to simulate climate variations to study, for example, effects of global warming. There is no single standard model. An InternationalStandard Atmosphere (ISA) has been deﬁned by the International Civil AviationOrganization (ICAO); there is also a similar U.S. Standard Atmosphere. The temperature proﬁle of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere is shown in Fig. 3.3 .

In order to integrate Eq. 3.6 to ﬁnd the pressure distribution, we need information about varia- tions in both ρandg. For most practical engineering situations, the variation in gis negligible. Only for a purpose such as computing very precisely the pressure change over a large elevationdifference would the variation in gneed to be included. Unless we state otherwise, we shall assume gto be constant with elevation at any given location. Incompressible Liquids: Manometers For an incompressible ﬂuid, ρ5constant.

Devices used for this purpose are called manometers .

Because the liquid level change is small at low pressure differential, a U-tube manometer may be difﬁcult to read accurately. The sensitivity of a manometer is a measure of how sensitive it is compared to a simple water-ﬁlled U-tube manom-eter. Speciﬁcally, it is the ratio of the deﬂection of the manometer to that of a water-ﬁlled U-tube manometer, due to the same applied pressure difference Δp. Sensitivity can be increased by changing the manometer design or by using two immiscibleliquids of slightly different density. Analysis of an inclined manometer is illustrated in Example 3.2.Example 3.1 SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE Normal blood pressure for a human is 120/80 mm Hg.

The following rules of thumb are useful: 1.Any two points at the same elevation in a continuous region of the same liquid are at the same pressure. 2.Pressure increases as one goes down a liquid column (remember the pressure change on diving into a swimming pool).Gage Liquid The gage liquid should have the smallest possible speciﬁc gravity to increase sensitivity. In addition, the gage liquidmust be safe (without toxic fumes or ﬂammability), be immiscible with the ﬂuid being gaged, suffer minimal lossfrom evaporation, and develop a satisfactory meniscus. Thus the gage liquid should have relatively low surfacetension and should accept dye to improve its visibility. Tables A.1, A.2, and A.4 show that hydrocarbon liquids satisfy many of these criteria. The lowest speciﬁc gravity is about 0.8, which increases manometer sensitivity by 25 percent compared to water. Diameter Ratio The plot shows the effect of diameter ratio on sensitivity for a vertical reservoir manometer with gage liquid of unityspeciﬁc gravity. Note that d/D51 corresponds to an ordinary U-tube manometer; its sensitivity is 0.5 because for this case the total deﬂection will be h, and for each side it will be h/2, so L5h/2. Sensitivity doubles to 1.0 as d/D approaches zero because most of the level change occurs in the measuring tube. The minimum tube diameter dmust be larger than about 6 mm to avoid excessive capillary effect. The maximum reservoir diameter Dis limited by the size of the manometer. If Dis set at 60 mm, so that d/Dis 0.1, then (d/D) 250.01, and the sensitivity increases to 0.99, very close to the maximum attainable value of 1.0. Inclination Angle The ﬁnal plot shows the effect of inclination angle on sensitivity for d/D50. Sensitivity increases sharply as incli- nation angle is reduced below 30 degrees. A practical limit is reached at about 10 degrees: The meniscus becomesindistinct and the level hard to read for smaller angles. Summary Combining the best values (SG 50.8,d/D50.1, and θ510 degrees) gives a manometer sensitivity of 6.81. Physically this is the ratio of observed gageliquid deﬂection to equivalent water column height. Thus the deﬂection inthe inclined tube is ampliﬁed 6.81 times compared to a vertical watercolumn. With improved sensitivity, a small pressure difference can be readmore accurately than with a water manometer, or a smaller pressuredifference can be read with the same accuracy.

The measured height may be converted to pressure using Eq. 3.7 and the data for speciﬁc gravity of mercury given in Appendix A, as discussed in the Notes of Example 3.1. Although the vapor pressure of mercury may be neglected, for precise work, temperature and altitude corrections must be appliedto the measured level and the effects of surface tension must be considered. Thecapillary effect in a tube caused by surface tension was illustrated in Example 2.3. Gases In many practical engineering problems density will vary appreciably with altitude,and accurate results will require that this variation be accounted for. Pressure var-iation in a compressible ﬂuid can be evaluated by integrating Eq. 3.6 if the density canbe expressed as a function of porz. Property information or an equation of state may be used to obtain the required relation for density. Several types of property variationmay be analyzed. (See Example 3.4.) The density of gases generally depends on pressure and temperature. The ideal gas equation of state, p5ρRT ð1:1Þ where Ris the gas constant (see Appendix A) and Tthe absolute temperature, accurately models the behavior of most gases under engineering conditions. However,the use of Eq. 1.1 introduces the gas temperature as an additional variable. Therefore,an additional assumption must be made about temperature variation before Eq. 3.6 can be integrated.Beginning at point Aand applying the equation between successive points along the manometer gives pC2pA51ρH2Ogd1 pD2pC52ρHggd2 pE2pD51ρoilgd3 pF2pE52ρHggd4 pB2pF52ρH2Ogd5 Multiplying each equation by minus one and adding, we obtain Eq.

Automobile hydraulic brakes develop pressures up to 10 MPa (1500 psi); aircraft and machinery hydraulic actuationsystems frequently are designed for pressures up to 40 MPa (6000 psi), and jacks usepressures to 70 MPa (10,000 psi). Special-purpose laboratory test equipment is com-mercially available for use at pressures to 1000 MPa (150,000 psi)! Although liquids are generally considered incompressible at ordinary pressures, density changes may be appreciable at high pressures. Bulk moduli of hydraulic ﬂuidsalso may vary sharply at high pressures. In problems involving unsteady ﬂow, both compressibility of the ﬂuid and elasticity of the boundary structure (e.g., the pipe walls) must be considered. Analysis of problems such as water hammer noise andvibration in hydraulic systems, actuators, and shock absorbers quickly becomescomplex and is beyond the scope of this book. 3.5 Hydrostatic Force on Submerged Surfaces Now that we have determined how the pressure varies in a static ﬂuid, we can examinethe force on a surface submerged in a liquid. In order to determine completely the resultant force acting on a submerged sur- face, we must specify: 1.The magnitude of the force. 2.The direction of the force. 3.The line of action of the force. We shall consider both plane and curved submerged surfaces. Hydrostatic Force on a Plane Submerged Surface A plane submerged surface, on whose upper face we wish to determine the resultant hydrostatic force, is shown in Fig. 3.5 . The coordinates are important: They have been chosen so that the surface lies in the xyplane, and the origin Ois located at the intersection of the plane surface (or its extension) and the free surface. As well as VIDEO Hydraulic Force Ampliﬁcation. θ hOLiquid surface dF FRLiquid, density = ρ Edge view y yz xdx y' dAx'dyx yxy plane viewed from above Point of application of FR (center of pressure)Ambient pressure, p0 Fig. 3.5 Plane submerged surface.3.5 Hydrostatic Force on Submerged Surfaces 69the magnitude of the force FR, we wish to locate the point (with coordinates xu,yu) through which it acts on the surface. Since there are no shear stresses in a static ﬂuid, the hydrostatic force on any element of the surface acts normal to the surface. The pressure force acting on an element dA5dx dy of the upper surface is given by dF5pd A Theresultant force acting on the surface is found by summing the contributions of the inﬁnitesimal forces over the entire area. Usually when we sum forces we must do so in a vectorial sense. However, in this case all of the inﬁnitesimal forces are perpendicular to the plane, and hence so is theresultant force. Its magnitude is given by FR5Z Apd A ð3:10aÞ In order to evaluate the integral in Eq. 3.10a, both the pressure, p, and the element of area, dA, must be expressed in terms of the same variables. We can use Eq. 3.7 to express the pressure pat depth hin the liquid as p5p01ρgh In this expression p0is the pressure at the free surface ( h50). In addition, we have, from the system geometry, h5ysinθ. Using this expression and the above expression for pressure in Eq. 3.10a, FR5Z Apd A5Z Aðp01ρghÞdA5Z Aðp01ρgysinθÞdA FR5p0Z AdA1ρgsinθZ Ayd A5p0A1ρgsinθZ Ayd A The integral is the ﬁrst moment of the surface area about the xaxis, which may be written Z Ayd A5ycA where ycis the ycoordinate of the centroid of the area, A. Thus, FR5p0A1ρgsinθycA5ðp01ρghcÞA or FR5pcA ð3:10bÞ where pcis the absolute pressure in the liquid at the location of the centroid of area A. Equation 3.10b computes the resultant force due to the liquid—including the effect ofthe ambient pressure p 0—on one side of a submerged plane surface. It does not take into account whatever pressure or force distribution may be on the other side ofthe surface. However, if we have the same pressure, p 0, on this side as we do at the free surface of the liquid, as shown in Fig. 3.6 , its effect on FRcancels out, and if we wish to obtain the netforce on the surface we can use Eq. 3.10b with p cexpressed as a gage rather than absolute pressure . In computing FRwe can use either the integral of Eq. 3.l0a or the resulting Eq. 3.10b. It is important to note that even though the force can be computed using the pressureat the center of the plate, this is notthe point through which the force acts! Our next task is to determine ( xu,yu), the location of the resultant force. Let’s ﬁrst obtain yuby recognizing that the moment of the resultant force about the xaxis must70 Chapter 3Fluid Staticsbe equal to the moment due to the distributed pressure force. Taking the sum (i.e., integral) of the moments of the inﬁnitesimal forces dFabout the xaxis we obtain yuFR5Z Ayp dA ð3:11aÞ We can integrate by expressing pas a function of yas before: yuFR5Z Ayp dA5Z Ayðp01ρghÞdA5Z Aðp0y1ρgy2sinθÞdA 5p0Z Ayd A1ρgsinθZ Ay2dA The ﬁrst integral is our familiar ycA. The second integral,R Ay2dA, is the second moment of area about the xaxis, Ixx. We can use the parallel axis theorem, Ixx5Ixˆxˆ1Ay2 c, to replace Ixxwith the standard second moment of area, about the centroidal xˆaxis.

If we have the same ambient pressure acting on the other side of the surface we can use Eq. 3.10b with p0neglected to compute the net force, FR5pcgageA5ρghcA5ρgycsinθA and Eq. 3.11b becomes for this case yu5yc1Ixˆxˆ Aycð3:11cÞ Equation 3.11a is the integral equation for computing the location yuof the resultant force; Eq. 3.11b is a useful algebraic form for computing yuwhen we are interested in the resultant force on the submerged side of the surface; Eq. 3.11c is for computing yuwhen we are interested in the net force for the case when the same p0acts at the free surface and on the other side of the submerged surfa ce. For problems that have a pressure on the other side that is not p 0, we can either analyze each side of the surface separately or reduce the two pressure distributions to one net pressure distribution, in effect creating a system to be solved using Eq. 3.10b with pcexpressed as a gage pressure.θhOLiquid surface Liquid, density = ρ Edge view yzAmbient pressure, p0 FR Fig. 3.6 Pressure distribution on plane submerged surface.3.5 Hydrostatic Force on Submerged Surfaces 71Note that in any event, yu.yc—the location of the force is always below the level of the plate centroid. This makes sense—as Fig. 3.6 shows, the pressures will always be larger on the lower regions, moving the resultant force down the plate. A similar analysis can be done to compute xu, thexlocation of the force on the plate. Taking the sum of the moments of the inﬁnitesimal forces dFabout the yaxis we obtain xuFR5Z Axpd A ð3:12aÞ We can express pas a function of yas before: xuFR5Z Axp dA5Z Axðp01ρghÞdA5Z Aðp0x1ρgxysinθÞdA 5p0Z Axd A1ρgsinθZ Axy dA The ﬁrst integral is xcA(where xcis the distance of the centroid from yaxis).

In summary, Eqs. 3.10 through 3.12 constitute a complete set of equations for com- puting the magnitude and location of the force due to hydrostatic pressure on any sub-merged planesurface. The direction of the force will always be perpendicular to the plane. We can now consider several examples using these equations. In Example 3.5 we use both the integral and algebraic sets of equations. Example 3.5 RESULTANT FORCE ON INCLINED PLANE SUBMERGED SURFACE The inclined surface shown, hinged along edge A, is 5 m wide.

Direct Integration Governing equations: p5p01ρgh F R5Z Apd A ηuFR5Z Aηpd A x uFR5Z Axp dA Because atmospheric pressure p0acts on both sides of the plate its effect cancels, and we can work in gage pressures (p5ρgh).

The pressure distributionson the inside and outside of the door will lead to a net force (and its location) that will be included in the FBD. We need to be careful in choosing the equations for computing the resultant force and its location. We can either use absolute pressures (as on the left FBD)and compute two forces (one on each side) or gage pressures and compute one force (as onthe right FBD). For simplicity we will use gage pressures. The right-hand FBD makes clearwe should use Eqs. 3.10b and 3.11b, which were derived for problems in which we wish toinclude thc effects of an ambient pressure ( p 0), or in other words, for problems when we have a nonzero gage pressure at the free surface.

However, unlike for the plane surface, we have a more complicated problem—the pressure force is normal to thesurface at each point, but now the inﬁnitesimal area elements point in varying directionsbecause of the surface curvature. This means that instead of integrating over an elementdAwe need to integrate over vector element d~A. This will initially lead to a more complicated analysis, but we will see that a simple solution technique will be developed. Consider the curved surface shown in Fig. 3.7 . The pressure force acting on the element of area, d~A, is given by d~F52pd~A where the minus sign indicates that the force acts on the area, in the direction oppositeto the area normal. The resultant force is given by ~F R52Z Apd~A ð3:13Þ We can write ~FR5^iFRx1^jFRy1^kFRz where FRx;FRy;andFRzare the components of ~FRin the positive x,y,a n d zdirections, respectively. To evaluate the component of the force in a given direction, we take the dot product of the force with the unit vector in the given direction. For example, takingthe dot product of each side of Eq. 3.13 with unit vector ^igives F Rx5~FRU^i5Z d~FU^i52Z Apd~AU^i52Z Axpd A xWe could have solved this problem by considering the two separate pres- sure distributions on each side of the door, leading to two resultant forces andtheir locations. Summing moments about point Awith these forces would also have yielded the same value for F t. (See Problem 3.59.) Note also that Eq. 3 could have been obtained directly (without separately ﬁnding FRand yu) by using a direct integration approach: X MA5FtL2Z Aypd A 50ThisExampleshows:üUse ofalgebraicequa tionsfornon-zero gagepressureattheliquidfreesurface.üUse ofthemom entequationfromstati csforcomputingtherequ iredappliedforce. z xydAdAx dAzdAyz = z0 Fig. 3.7 Curved submerged surface.76 Chapter 3Fluid Staticswhere dAxis the projection of d~Aon a plane perpendicular to the xaxis (see Fig. 3.7 ), and the minus sign indicates that the xcomponent of the resultant force is in the negative xdirection. Since, in any problem, the direction of the force component can be determined by inspection, the use of vectors is not necessary. In general, the magnitude of the component of the resultant force in the ldirection is given by FRl5Z Alpd A l ð3:14Þ where dAlis the projection of the area element dAon a plane perpendicular to the l direction. The line of action of each component of the resultant force is found byrecognizing that the moment of the resultant force component about a given axis mustbe equal to the moment of the corresponding distributed force component about thesame axis. Equation 3.14 can be used for the horizontal forces F RxandFRy. We have the interesting result that the horizontal force and its location are the same as for an imaginary vertical plane surface of the same projected area . This is illustrated in Fig. 3.8 , where we have called the horizontal force FH. Figure 3.8 also illustrates how we can compute the vertical component of force: With atmospheric pressure at the free surface and on the other side of the curvedsurface the net vertical force will be equal to the weight of ﬂuid directly above the surface . This can be seen by applying Eq. 3.14 to determine the magnitude of the vertical component of the resultant force, obtaining F Rz5FV5Z pdA z Since p5ρgh, FV5Z ρgh dA z5Z ρgd V--- where ρgh dA z5ρgd V---is the weight of a differential cylinder of liquid above the element of surface area, dAz, extending a distance hfrom the curved surface to the free surface.

Thus F V5Z Azρgh dA z5Z V---ρgd V---5ρgV--- In summary, for a curved surface we can use two simple formulas for computing thehorizontal and vertical force components due to the ﬂuid only (no ambient pressure), FH5pcAand FV5ρgV--- ð3:15ÞCurved surface+ FHFV FV = gVρ FH = pcALiquid volume Fig. 3.8 Forces on curved submerged surface.3.5 Hydrostatic Force on Submerged Surfaces 77where pcandAare the pressure at the center and the area, respectively, of a vertical plane surface of the same projected area, and V---is the volume of ﬂuid above the curved surface. It can be shown that the line of action of the vertical force component passes through the center of gravity of the volume of liquid directly above the curved surface (see Example 3.7). We have shown that the resultant hydrostatic force on a curved submerged surface is speciﬁed in terms of its components. We recall from our study of statics that theresultant of any force system can be represented by a force-couple system, i.e.,the resultant force applied at a point and a couple about that point. If the forceand the couple vectors are orthogonal (as is the case for a two-dimensional curvedsurface), the resultant can be represented as a pure force with a unique line of action. Otherwise the resultant may be represented as a “wrench,” also having a unique line of action. Example 3.7 FORCE COMPONENTS ON A CURVED SUBMERGED SURFACE The gate shown is hinged at Oand has constant width, w55 m. The equation of the surface is x5y2/a, where a54 m. The depth of water to the right of the gate is D54 m. Find the magnitude of the force, Fa, applied as shown, required to maintain the gate in equilibrium if the weight of the gate is neglected. Given: Gate of constant width, w55m . Equation of surface in xyplane is x5y2/a, where a54m . Water stands at depth D54 m to the right of the gate. Force Fais applied as shown, and weight of gate is to be neglected. (Note that for simplicity we do not show the reactions at O.) Find: Force Farequired to maintain the gate in equilibrium. Solution: We will take moments about point Oafter ﬁnding the magnitudes and locations of the horizontal and vertical forces due to the water. The free body diagram (FBD) of the system is shown above in part (a). Before proceeding we need tothink about how we compute F V, the vertical component of the ﬂuid force—we have stated that it is equal (in mag- nitude and location) to the weight of ﬂuid directly above the curved surface. However, we have no ﬂuid directly abovethe gate, even though it is clear that the ﬂuid does exert a vertical force! We need to do a “thought experiment” inwhich we imagine having a system with water on both sides of the gate (with null effect), minus a system with waterdirectly above the gate (which generates ﬂuid forces). This logic is demonstrated above: the system FBD(a) 5the null FBD(b) 2the ﬂuid forces FBD(c). Thus the vertical and horizontal ﬂuid forces on the system, FBD(a), are equal and opposite to those on FBD(c). In summary, the magnitude and location of the vertical ﬂuid force F Vare given by the weight and location of the centroid of the ﬂuid “above” the gate; the magnitude and location of the horizontal ﬂuidforce F Hare given by the magnitude and location of the force on an equivalent vertical ﬂat plate.D = 4 mFay xx =y2___al = 5 m O (a) System FBDxy Fa FHFV (b) Null fluid forces (c) Fluid forcesxyFal = 5 m xx'y y' FHFV– O78 Chapter 3Fluid StaticsGoverning equations: FH5pcA y u5yc1Ixˆxˆ AycFV5ρgV--- xu5water center of gravity ForFH, the centroid, area, and second moment of the equivalent vertical ﬂat plate are, respectively, yc5hc5D/2, A5Dw,a n dI xˆxˆ5wD3/12.

Consider an object totally immersed in static liquid, as shown in Fig. 3.9 . The vertical force on the body due to hydrostatic pressure may be found most easily by considering cylindrical volume elements similar to the one shown in Fig. 3.9 . We recall that we can use Eq. 3.7 for computing the pressure pat depth hin a liquid, p5p01ρgh The net vertical pressure force on the element is then dFz5ðp01ρgh2ÞdA2ðp01ρgh1ÞdA5ρgðh22h1ÞdA Butðh22h1ÞdA5dV---, the volume of the element. Thus Fz5Z dFz5Z V---ρgdV---5ρgV--- where V---is the volume of the object. Hence we conclude that for a submerged body the buoyancy force of the ﬂuid is equal to the weight of displaced ﬂuid , Fbuoyancy 5ρgV--- ð3:16Þ This relation reportedly was used by Archimedes in 220 B.C. to determine the gold content in the crown of King Hiero II. Consequently, it is often called “Archimedes’Principle.” In more current technical applications, Eq. 3.16 is used to design dis- placement vessels, ﬂotation gear, and submersibles [1]. The submerged object need not be solid. Hydrogen bubbles, used to visualize streaklines and timelines in water (see Section 2.2), are positively buoyant; they riseslowly as they are swept along by the ﬂow. Conversely, water droplets in oil arenegatively buoyant and tend to sink. Airships and balloons are termed “lighter-than-air” craft. The density of an ideal gas is proportional to molecular weight, so hydrogen and helium are less dense than air at the same temperature and pressure. Hydrogen ( M m52) is less dense than helium ( Mm54), but extremely ﬂammable, whereas helium is inert. Hydrogen has not been used com- mercially since the disastrous explosion of the German passenger airship Hindenburg in The use of buoyancy force to generate lift is illustrated in Example 3.8. Equation 3.16 predicts the net vertical pressure force on a body that is totally submerged in a single liquid. In cases of partial immersion, a ﬂoating body displaces itsown weight of the liquid in which it ﬂoats. The line of action of the buoyancy force, which may be found using the methods of Section 3.5, acts through the centroid of the displaced volume. Since ﬂoating bodies zhh1 h2p0 Liquid, density = ρ ddA V Fig. 3.9 Immersed body in static liquid. 1This section may be omitted without loss of continuity in the text material.80 Chapter 3Fluid Staticsare in equilibrium under body and buoyancy forces, the location of the line of action of the buoyancy force determines stability, as shown in Fig. 3.10 . The weight of an object acts through its center of gravity, CG. In Fig. 3.10 a, the lines of action of the buoyancy and the weight are offset in such a way as to produce a couplethat tends to right the craft. In Fig. 3.10 b, the couple tends to capsize the craft. Ballast may be needed to achieve roll stability. Wooden warships carried stone ballast low in the hull to offset the weight of the heavy cannon on upper gun decks.Example 3.8 BUOYANCY FORCE IN A HOT AIR BALLOON A hot air balloon (approximated as a sphere of diameter 50 ft) is to lift a basket load of600 lbf. To what temperature must the air be heated in order to achieve liftoff? Given: Atmosphere at STP, diameter of balloon d550 ft, and load W load5600 lbf. Find: The hot air temperature to attain liftoff. Solution: Apply the buoyancy equation to determine the lift generated by atmosphere, and apply the vertical force equilibrium equation to obtain the hot air density. Then use the ideal gas equation to obtain the hot air temperature. Governing equations: Fbuoyancy 5ρgV---X Fy50 p5ρRT Assumptions: (1) Ideal gas. (2) Atmospheric pressure throughout.

In stacking containers high on the deck of a container ship, care is needed to avoid raising the center of gravity to a level that may result in the unstable conditiondepicted in Fig. 3.10 b. For a vessel with a relatively ﬂat bottom, as shown in Fig. 3.10 a, the restoring moment increases as roll angle becomes larger. At some angle, typically that at whichthe edge of the deck goes below water level, the restoring moment peaks and starts todecrease. The moment may become zero at some large roll angle, known as the angleof vanishing stability. The vessel may capsize if the roll exceeds this angle; then, if still intact, the vessel may ﬁnd a new equilibrium state upside down. The actual shape of the restoring moment curve depends on hull shape. A broad beam gives a large lateral shift in the line of action of the buoyancy force and thus a high restoring moment. High freeboard above the water line increases the angle at which themoment curve peaks, but may make the moment drop rapidly above this angle. Sailing vessels are subjected to large lateral forces as wind engages the sails (a boat under sail in a brisk wind typically operates at a considerable roll angle). The lateralwind force must be counteracted by a heavily weighted keel extended below the hull bottom. In small sailboats, crew members may lean far over the side to add additional restoring moment to prevent capsizing [2]. Within broad limits, the buoyancy of a surface vessel is adjusted automatically as the vessel rides higher or lower in the water. However, craft that operate fully sub- merged must actively adjust buoyancy and gravity forces to remain neutrally buoyant. For submarines this is accomplished using tanks which are ﬂooded to reduce excess buoyancy or blown out with compressed air to increase buoyancy [1]. Airships may vent gas to descend or drop ballast to rise. Buoyancy of a hot-air balloon is controlled by varying the air temperature within the balloon envelope. For deep ocean dives use of compressed air becomes impractical because of the high pressures (the Paciﬁc Ocean is over 10 km deep; seawater pressure at this depth is greater than 1000 atmospheres!). A liquid such as gasoline, which is buoyant in seawater, may be used to provide buoyancy. However, because gasoline is more compressible than water, its buoyancy decreases as the dive gets deeper. Therefore it is necessary to carry and drop ballast to achieve positive buoyancy for the return trip to the surface. The most structurally efﬁcient hull shape for airships and submarines has a circular cross-section. The buoyancy force passes through the center of the circle. Therefore, for roll stability the CG must be located below the hull centerline. Thus the crew compartment of an airship is placed beneath the hull to lower the CG. 3.7 Fluids in Rigid-Body Motion (on the Web)buoyancy buoyancy gravitygravity (a) Stable (b) UnstableCGCG Fig. 3.10 Stability of ﬂoating bodies.82 Chapter 3Fluid Statics3.8 Summary and Useful Equations In this chapter we have reviewed the basic concepts of ﬂuid statics.

Problems 3.1Compressed nitrogen (140 lbm) is stored in a spherical tank of diameter D= 2.5 ft at a temperature of 77/C14F. What is the pressure inside the tank? If the maximum allowable stress in the tank is 30 ksi, ﬁnd the minimum theoretical wall thickness of the tank. Standard Atmosphere 3.2 Because the pressure falls, water boils at a lower tem- perature with increasing altitude. Consequently, cake mixesand boiled eggs, among other foods, must be cooked dif- ferent lengths of time. Determine the boiling temperature of water at 1000 and 2000 m elevation on a standard day, andcompare with the sea-level value. 3.3 Ear “popping” is an unpleasant phenomenon sometimes experienced when a change in pressure occurs, for example in a fast-moving elevator or in an airplane. If you are in a two-seater airplane at 3000 m and a descent of 100 m causesyour ears to “pop,” what is the pressure change that your ears “pop” at, in millimeters of mercury? If the airplane now rises to 8000 m and again begins descending, how far will the air-plane descend before your ears “pop” again? Assume a U.S. Standard Atmosphere.3.4 When you are on a mountain face and boil water, you notice that the water temperature is 195/C14F. What is your approximate altitude?

Hydrostatics, the study of ﬂuids at rest, is an ancient discipline, so one might think there are no new orexciting applications still to be developed. The Falkirkwheel in Scotland is a dramatic demonstration thatthis is not the case; it is a novel replacement for a lock, a device for moving a boat from one water level to another. The wheel, which has a diameter of 35 m,consists of two sets of axe-shaped opposing arms(which take the shape of a Celtic-inspired, double-headed axe). Sitting in bearings in the ends of thesearms are two water-ﬁlled caissons, or tanks, each witha capacity of 80,000 gal. The hydrostatics concept ofArchimedes’ principle, which we studied in this chap- ter, states that ﬂoating objects displace their own weight of water. Hence, the boat shown entering thelower caisson displaces water from the caissonweighing exactly the same as the boat itself. Thismeans the entire wheel remains balanced at all times(both caissons always carry the same weight, whethercontaining boats or not), and so, despite its enormousmass, it rotates through 180 /C14in less than four minutes while using very little power. The electric motors usedfor this use 22.5 kilowatts (kW) of power, so theenergy used in four minutes is about 1.5 kilowatt-hours (kWh); even at current prices, this works out tobe only a few cents worth of energy.84 Chapter 3Fluid Statics3.7 The following pressure and temperature measurements were taken by a meteorological balloon rising through the lower atmosphere: p(psia) 14.71 14.62 14.53 14.45 14.36 14.27 14.18 14.1 14.01 13.92 13.84 T(/C14F) 53.6 52 50.9 50.4 50.2 50 50.5 51.4 52.9 54 53.8 The initial values (top of table) correspond to ground level.Using the ideal gas law ( p=ρRTwith R= 53.3 ft /C1lbf/ lbm/C1 /C14R), compute and plot the variation of air density (in lbm/ft3) with height. 3.8 A hollow metal cube with sides 100 mm ﬂoats at the interface between a layer of water and a layer of SAE 10Woil such that 10% of the cube is exposed to the oil.

What is the average density of the cube? 3.9 Your pressure gage indicates that the pressure in your cold tires is0.25MPa (gage) ona mountain atan elevationof 3500m. What is the absolute pressure?

Assume a U.S. Standard Atmosphere. 3.10 An air bubble, 0.3 in. in diameter, is released from the regulator of a scuba diver swimming 100 ft below the seasurface. (The water temperature is 86 /C14F.) Estimate the diam- eter of the bubble just before it reaches the water surface. 3.11 A cube with 6 in. sides is suspended in a ﬂuid by a wire. The top of the cube is horizontal and 8 in. below the freesurface. If the cube has a mass of 2 slugs and the tension inthe wire is T550.7 lbf, compute the ﬂuid speciﬁc gravity, and from this determine the ﬂuid. What are the gage pres-sures on the upper and lower surfaces? 3.12 Assuming the bulk modulus is constant for seawater, derive an expression for the density variation with depth, h, below the surface. Show that the result may be written ρ/C25ρ0þbh where ρ0is the density at the surface. Evaluate the constant b. Then, using the approximation, obtain an equation for the variation of pressure with depth below the surface. Deter-mine the depth in feet at which the error in pressure pre-dicted by the approximate solution is 0.01 percent. 3.13 Oceanographic research vessels have descended to 6.5 mi below sea level. At these extreme depths, the com-pressibility of seawater can be signiﬁcant. One may modelthe behavior of seawater by assuming that its bulk modulus remains constant. Using this assumption, evaluate the deviations in density and pressure compared with valuescomputed using the incompressible assumption at a depth, h, of 6.5 mi in seawater. Express your answers as a percentage.Plot the results over the range 0 #h#7 mi. 3.14 An inverted cylindrical container is lowered slowly beneath the surface of a pool of water.

There are two options available to us, discussed in Chapter 1: 1.We can study the motion of an individual ﬂuid particle or group of particles as they move through space. This is the system approach, which has the advantage that the physical laws (e.g., Newton’s second law, ~F5d~P=dt, where ~Fis the force and d~P=dtis the rate of momentum change of the ﬂuid) apply to matter and hence directly to the system. One disadvantage is that in practice the math associated with this approach can become somewhat complicated, usually leading to a set of partial differential equations. We will look at this approach in detail in Chapter 5. The system approach is needed if we are interested in studying the trajectory of par-ticles over time, for example, in pollution studies. 2.We can study a region of space as ﬂuid ﬂows through it, which is the control volume approach. This is very often the method of choice, because it has widespread practical application; for example, in aerodynamics we are usually interested in the lift and drag on a wing (which we select as part of the control volume) rather than what happens to individual ﬂuid particles. The disadvantage of this approach is thatCase Study in Energy and the Environment Wave Power: Pelamis Wave Energy Converter As we have seen in earlier Case Studies in Energy and the Environment, there is a lot of renewable energy in ocean waves that could be exploited. A good example of amachine for doing this is the Pelamis Wave Energy Converter developed by Pelamis Wave Power Ltd .i n Scotland. This machine was the world’s ﬁrst commercial-scale machine to generate power and supply it to thepower grid from offshore wave energy, and the ﬁrst to beused in a commercial wave farm project. The wave-powered electrical generating machine consists of a partially submerged, articulated structuremade up of cylindrical sections connected by hingedjoints. As waves pass over the structure, the ﬂexingmotion of the joints (generated by buoyancy forces,discussed in Chapter 3) is resisted by an arrangementof hydraulic “rams” inside the cylindrical sections;these rams are then used to pump high-pressure ﬂuidthrough hydraulic motors, which ultimately drive elec-trical generators to produce electricity. The power thatis generated in each joint is sent down a single cable toa junction device on the sea bed; several devices can be connected together (as suggested in the schematic) and linked to shore through a single seabed cable. The latest generation of machines are 180 meters long (they have four sections, each 45 meters long) and4 meters in diameter, with four power conversionmodules. Each machine can generate up to 750 kilo-watts, depending on the speciﬁc environmental condi-tions at the site; they will produce 25 /C040 percent of the full rated output, on average, over the course of a year.Hence each machine can provide sufﬁcient power tomeet the annual electricity demand of about 500 homes.This is not a future technology; three ﬁrst-generationmachines have already been installed off the coast ofPortugal, and a single machine is being built and afour-unit machine (generating 3 megawatts of power) isplanned for use off the northern coast of Scotland. Pelamis Wave Power Ltd . has also expressed interest in installing Pelamis machines off the coast of Cornwall in England, and in the Paciﬁc Ocean off the coast ofTillamook, Oregon. The Pelamis machine has a number of advantages: It is durable and low maintenance,uses available technology, and generates electricityinexpensively. Schematic of possible Pelamis wave farm. (Picture courtesy of Pelamis Wave Power Ltd.)Basic Equations in Integral Form for a Control Volume 97the physical laws apply to matter and not directly to regions of space, so we have to perform some math to convert physical laws from their system formulation to acontrol volume formulation. We will examine the control volume approach in this chapter. The alert reader willnotice that this chapter has the word integral in its title, and Chapter 5 has the word differential . This is an important distinction: It indicates that we will study a ﬁnite region in this chapter and the motion of a particle (an inﬁnitesimal) in Chapter 5 (although in Section 4.4 we will look at a differential control volume to derive the famous Bernoulli equation). The agenda for this chapter is to review the physicallaws as they apply to a system (Section 4.1); develop some math to convert from asystem to a control volume (Section 4.2) description; and obtain formulas for thephysical laws for control volume analysis by combining the results of Sections 4.1and 4.2. 4.1 Basic Laws for a System The basic laws we will apply are conservation of mass, Newton’s second law, theangular-momentum principle, and the ﬁrst and second laws of thermodynamics. Forconverting these system equations to equivalent control volume formulas, it turns outwe want to express each of the laws as a rate equation. Conservation of Mass For a system (by deﬁnition a ﬁxed amount of matter, M, we have chosen) we have the simple result that M5constant.

Our task in this section is to develop a general expression for converting a system rate equation intoan equivalent control volume equation. Instead of converting the equations for ratesof change of M,~P,~H,E, and S(Eqs. 4.1a, 4.2a, 4.3a, 4.4a, and 4.5a) one by one, we let all of them be represented by the symbol N. Hence Nrepresents the amount of mass, or momentum, or angular momentum, or energy, or entropy of the system. Corre-sponding to this extensive property, we will also need the intensive (i.e., per unit mass)property η. Thus N system5Z Mðsystem Þηdm5Z V---ðsystem ÞηρdV--- ð4:6Þ Comparing Eq. 4.6 with Eqs. 4.1b, 4.2b, 4.3b, 4.4b, and 4.5b, we see that if: N5M;then η51 N5~P;then η5~V N5~H;then η5~r3~V N5E;then η5e N5S; then η5s How can we derive a control volume description from a system description of a ﬂuid ﬂow? Before speciﬁcally answering this question, we can describe the derivation in general terms. We imagine selecting an arbitrary piece of the ﬂowing ﬂuid at some time t0, as shown in Fig. 4.1 a—we could imagine dyeing this piece of ﬂuid, say, blue. y x zy x zStreamlines at time, t0Subregion (1) of region ISubregion (3) of region III IIIIII System Control volume (b) Time, t0 + Δ t (a) Time, t0 Fig. 4.1 System and control volume conﬁguration.100 Chapter 4Basic Equations in Integral Form for a Control VolumeThis initial shape of the ﬂuid system is chosen as our control volume, which is ﬁxed in space relative to coordinates xyz. After an inﬁnitesimal time Δtthe system will have moved (probably changing shape as it does so) to a new location, as shown in Fig. 4.1 b. The laws we discussed above apply to this piece of ﬂuid—for example, its mass will be constant (Eq. 4.1a). By examining the geometry of the system/control volume pair at t5t0and at t5t01Δt, we will be able to obtain control volume for- mulations of the basic laws. Derivation From Fig. 4.1 we see that the system, which was entirely within the control volume at time t0, is partially out of the control volume at time t01Δt. In fact, three regions can be identiﬁed. These are: regions I and II, which together make up the control volume,and region III, which, with region II, is the location of the system at time t 01Δt. Recall that our objective is to relate the rate of change of any arbitrary extensive property, N, of the system to quantities associated with the control volume. From the deﬁnition of a derivative, the rate of change of Nsystem is given by dN dt/C19 system/C17lim Δt-0NsÞt01Δt2NsÞt0 Δtð4:7Þ For convenience, subscript shas been used to denote the system in the deﬁnition of a derivative in Eq. 4.7.

The vector area element d~Aof the control surface has magnitude dA, and its direction is the outward normal of the area element. In general, the velocity vector ~Vwill be at some angle αwith respect to d~A.4.2 Relation of System Derivatives to the Control Volume Formulation 101For this subregion we have dNIIIÞt01Δt5ðηρdV---Þt01Δt We need to obtain an expression for the volume dV---of this cylindrical element.

Hence, for subregion (3) we can write dNIIIÞt01Δt5ηρ~V/C1d~AΔt Then, for the entire region III we can integrate and for term 2in Eq. 4.8 obtain lim Δt-0NIIIÞt01Δt Δt5lim Δt-0R CSIIIdNIIIÞt01Δt Δt5lim Δt-0R CSIIIηρ~V/C1d~AΔt Δt5Z CSIIIηρ~V/C1d~Að4:9bÞ We can perform a similar analysis for subregion (1) of region I, and obtain for term in Eq. 4.8 lim Δt-0NIÞt01Δt Δt52Z CS1ηρ~V/C1d~A ð4:9cÞ For subregion (1), the velocity vector acts into the control volume, but the area normal always (by convention) points outward (angle α.π/2), so the scalar product in Eq. 4.9c is negative. Hence the minus sign in Eq. 4.9c is needed to cancel thenegative result of the scalar product to make sure we obtain a positive result for theamount of matter that was in region I (we can’t have negative matter). This concept of the sign of the scalar product is illustrated in Fig. 4.3 for (a) the general case of an inlet or exit, (b) an exit velocity parallel to the surface normal, and (c) an inlet velocity parallel to the surface normal. Cases (b) and (c) are obviously convenient special cases of (a); the value of the cosine in case (a) automatically generates the correct sign of either an inlet or an exit.

It is the fundamental relation between the rate of change of any arbitrary extensive property, N, of a system and the variations of this property associated with a control volume. Some authors refer toEq. 4.10 as the Reynolds Transport Theorem . Physical Interpretation It took several pages, but we have reached our goal: We now have a formula (Eq. 4.10)that we can use to convert the rate of change of any extensive property Nof a system to an equivalent formulation for use with a control volume. We can now use Eq. 4.10 inthe various basic physical law equations (Eqs. 4.1a, 4.2a, 4.3a, 4.4a, and 4.5a) one byone, with Nreplaced with each of the properties M,~P,~H,E,a n d S(with corresponding symbols for η), to replace system derivatives with control volume expressions. Because we consider the equation itself to be “basic” we repeat it to emphasize its importance: dN dt/C19 system5@ @tZ CVηρdV---1Z CSηρ~V/C1d~A ð4:10Þ We need to be clear here: The system is the matter that happens to be passing throughthe chosen control volume, at the instant we chose. For example, if we chose as acontrol volume the region contained by an airplane wing and an imaginary rectan- gular boundary around it, the system would be the mass of the air that is instanta- neously contained between the rectangle and the airfoil. Before applying Eq. 4.10 tothe physical laws, let’s discuss the meaning of each term of the equation: dN dt/C19 systemis the rate of change of the system extensive property N. For exam- ple, if N5~P, we obtain the rate of change of momentum. @ @tZ CVηρdV--- is the rate of change of the amount of property Nin the control volume. The termR CVηρdV---computes the instantaneous value of Nin the control volume (R CVρdV---is the instantaneous mass in the control volume). For example, if N5~P, then η5~VandR CV~VρdV---computes the instantaneous amount of momentum in the control volume.Z CSηρ~V/C1d~A is the rate at which property Nis exiting the surface of the control volume. The term ρ~V/C1d~Acomputes the rate of mass transfer leaving across control surface area element d~A; multiplying by ηcomputes the rate of ﬂux of property Nacross the element; and integrating therefore computes the net ﬂux of Nout of the control volume. For example, if N5~P, then η5~VandR CS~Vρ~V/C1d~Acomputes the net ﬂux of momentum out of the control volume. We make two comments about velocity ~Vin Eq. 4.10. First, we reiterate the dis- cussion for Fig. 4.3 that care should be taken in evaluating the dot product: Because ~A is always directed outwards, the dot product will be positive when ~Vis outward andV · dA = VdA cos /H9251V/H9251dA CS (a) General inlet/exitV · dA = +VdAV CS (b) Normal exitV · dA = –VdAV CS (c) Normal inletdA dA Fig. 4.3 Evaluating the scalar product.4.2 Relation of System Derivatives to the Control Volume Formulation 103negative when ~Vis inward. Second, ~Vis measured with respect to the control volume: When the control volume coordinates xyzare stationary or moving with a constant linear velocity, the control volume will constitute an inertial frame and the physical laws (speciﬁcally Newton’s second law) we have described will apply.1 With these comments we are ready to combine the physical laws (Eqs. 4.1a, 4.2a, 4.3a, 4.4a, and 4.5a) with Eq. 4.10 to obtain some useful control volume equations. 4.3 Conservation of Mass The ﬁrst physical principle to which we apply this conversion from a system to a control volume description is the mass conservation principle: The mass of the systemremains constant, dM dt/C19 system50 ð4:1aÞ where Msystem5Z Mðsystem Þdm5Z V---ðsystem ÞρdV--- ð4:1bÞ The system and control volume formulations are related by Eq. 4.10, dN dt/C19 system5@ @tZ CVηρdV---1Z CSηρ~V/C1d~A ð4:10Þ where Nsystem5Z Mðsystem Þηdm5Z V---ðsystem ÞηρdV--- ð4:6Þ To derive the control volume formulation of conservation of mass, we set N5M and η51 With this substitution, we obtain dM dt/C19 system5@ @tZ CVρdV---1Z CSρ~V/C1d~A ð4:11Þ Comparing Eqs. 4.1a and 4.11, we arrive (after rearranging) at the control volumeformulation of the conservation of mass: @ @tZ CVρdV---1Z CSρ~V/C1d~A50 ð4:12Þ In Eq. 4.12 the ﬁrst term represents the rate of change of mass within the controlvolume; the second term represents the net rate of mass ﬂux out through the controlsurface. Equation 4.12 indicates that the rate of change of mass in the control volumeplus the net outﬂow is zero. The mass conservation equation is also called the 1For an accelerating control volume (one whose coordinates xyzare accelerating with respect to an “absolute” set of coordinates XYZ ), we must modify the form of Newton’s second law (Eq. 4.2a). We will do this in Sections 4.6 (linear acceleration) and 4.7 (arbitrary acceleration).104 Chapter 4Basic Equations in Integral Form for a Control Volumecontinuity equation. In common-sense terms, the rate of increase of mass in the control volume is due to the net inﬂow of mass: Rate of increase of mass in CV5Net influx of mass @ @tZ CVρdV---52Z CSρ~V/C1d~A Once again, we note that in using Eq. 4.12, care should be taken in evaluating the scalar product ~V/C1d~A5VdA cosα: It could be positive (outﬂow, α,π/2), negative (inﬂow, α.π/2), or even zero ( α5π/2). Recall that Fig. 4.3 illustrates the general case as well as the convenient cases α50 and α5π. Special Cases In special cases it is possible to simplify Eq. 4.12. Consider ﬁrst the case of anincompressible ﬂuid, in which density remains constant. When ρis constant, it is not a function of space or time. Consequently, for incompressible ﬂuids , Eq. 4.12 may be written as ρ@ @tZ CVdV---1ρZ CS~V/C1d~A50 The integral of dV---over the control volume is simply the volume of the control volume. Thus, on dividing through by ρ, we write @V--- @t1Z CS~V/C1d~A50 For a nondeformable control volume of ﬁxed size and shape, V---5constant. The conservation of mass for incompressible ﬂow through a ﬁxed control volume becomes Z CS~V/C1d~A50 ð4:13aÞ A useful special case is when we have (or can approximate) uniform velocity at each inlet and exit. In this case Eq. 4.13a simpliﬁes to X CS~V/C1~A50 ð4:13bÞ Note that we have not assumed the ﬂow to be steady in reducing Eq. 4.12 to the forms4.13a and 4.13b. We have only imposed the restriction of incompressible ﬂuid. ThusEqs. 4.13a and 4.13b are statements of conservation of mass for ﬂow of anincompressible ﬂuid that may be steady or unsteady. The dimensions of the integrand in Eq. 4.13a are L 3/t. The integral of ~V/C1d~Aover a section of the control surface is commonly called the volume ﬂow rate orvolume rate of ﬂow . Thus, for incompressible ﬂow, the volume ﬂow rate into a ﬁxed control volume must be equal to the volume ﬂow rate out of the control volume. The volumeﬂow rate Q, through a section of a control surface of area A, is given by Q5Z A~V/C1d~A ð4:14aÞ VIDEO Mass Conservation: Filling a Tank. 4.3 Conservation of Mass 105The average velocity magnitude, ~V, at a section is deﬁned as ~V5Q A51 AZ A~V/C1d~A ð4:14bÞ Consider now the general case of steady, compressible ﬂow through a ﬁxed control volume. Since the ﬂow is steady, this means that at most ρ5ρ(x,y,z). By deﬁnition, no ﬂuid property varies with time in a steady ﬂow. Consequently, the ﬁrst term of Eq. 4.12 must be zero and, hence, for steady ﬂow, the statement of conservation ofmass reduces to Z CSρ~V/C1d~A50 ð4:15aÞ A useful special case is when we have (or can approximate) uniform velocity at each inlet and exit. In this case, Eq. 4.15a simpliﬁes to X CSρ~V/C1~A50 ð4:15bÞ Thus, for steady ﬂow, the mass ﬂow rate into a control volume must be equal to themass ﬂow rate out of the control volume. We will now look at three Examples to illustrate some features of the various forms of the conservation of mass equation for a control volume. Example 4.1 involves a problemin which we have uniform ﬂow at each section, Example 4.2 involves a problem in whichwe do not have uniform ﬂow at a location, and Example 4.3 involves a problem inwhich we have unsteady ﬂow. Example 4.1 MASS FLOW AT A PIPE JUNCTION Consider the steady ﬂow in a water pipe joint shown in the diagram.The areas are: A 150.2 m2,A250.2 m2,a n dA 350.15 m2.

We use the same procedure we just used for mass conservation, with one note of caution: the control volume coordinates (with respect to which we measure all velocities) areinertial; that is, the control volume coordinates xyzare either at rest or moving at constant speed with respect to an “absolute” set of coordinates XYZ . (Sections 4.6 and 4.7 will analyze noninertial control volumes.) We begin with the mathematicalformulation for a system and then use Eq. 4.10 to go from the system to the controlvolume formulation.Since properties are assumed uniform in the tank at any instant, we can take ρout from within the volume integral of the ﬁrst term, @ @tρCVZ CVdV---/C20/C21 1Z CSρ~V/C1d~A50 Now,R CVdV---5V---, and hence @ @tðρV---ÞCV1Z CSρ~V/C1d~A50 The only place where mass crosses the boundary of the control volume is at surface 1.

It states that the total force (due to surface and body forces) acting on the control volume leads to a rate of change of momentum within the control volume (the volume integral) and/or a net rate at which momentum is leavingthe control volume through the control surface. We must be a little careful in applying Eqs. 4.17. The ﬁrst step will always be to carefully choose a control volume and its control surface so that we can evaluate the volume integral and the surface integral (or summation); each inlet and exit should be4.4 Momentum Equation for Inertial Control Volume 111carefully labeled, as should the external forces acting. In ﬂuid mechanics the body force is usually gravity, so ~FB5Z CVρ~gd V---5~WCV5M~g where ~gis the acceleration of gravity and ~WCVis the instantaneous weight of the entire control volume. In many applications the surface force is due to pressure, ~FS5Z A2pd~A Note that the minus sign is to ensure that we always compute pressure forces actingonto the control surface (recall d~Awas chosen to be a vector pointing outof the control volume). It is worth stressing that even at points on the surface that have an outﬂow , the pressure force acts onto the control volume. In Eqs. 4.17 we must also be careful in evaluatingR CS~Vρ~V/C1d~AorΣCS~Vρ~V/C1~A (this may be easier to do if we write them with the implied parentheses,R CS~Vρð~V/C1d~AÞorΣCS~Vρð~V/C1~AÞ). The velocity ~Vmust be measured with respect to the control volume coordinates xyz, with the appropriate signs for its vector com- ponents u,v, and w; recall also that the scalar product will be positive for outﬂow and negative for inﬂow (refer to Fig. 4.3 ). The momentum equation (Eqs. 4.17) is a vector equation. We will usually write the three scalar components, as measured in the xyzcoordinates of the control volume, Fx5FSx1FBx5@ @tZ CVuρdV---1Z CSuρ~V/C1d~A ð4:18aÞ Fy5FSy1FBy5@ @tZ CVvρdV---1Z CSvρ~V/C1d~A ð4:18bÞ Fz5FSz1FBz5@ @tZ CVwρdV---1Z CSwρ~V/C1d~A ð4:18cÞ or, for uniform ﬂow at each inlet and exit, Fx5FSx1FBx5@ @tZ CVuρdV---1X CSuρ~V/C1~A ð4:18dÞ Fy5FSy1FBy5@ @tZ CVvρdV---1X CSvρ~V/C1~A ð4:18eÞ Fz5FSz1FBz5@ @tZ CVwρdV---1X CSwρ~V/C1~A ð4:18fÞ Note that, as we found for the mass conservation equation (Eq. 4.12), for steady ﬂow the ﬁrst term on the right in Eqs. 4.17 and 4.18 is zero. We will now look at ﬁve Examples to illustrate some features of the various forms of the momentum equation for a control volume. Example 4.4 demonstrates howintelligent choice of the control volume can simplify analysis of a problem, Example4.5 involves a problem in which we have signiﬁcant body forces, Example 4.6 explainshow to simplify surface force evaluations by working in gage pressures, Example 4.7 involves nonuniform surface forces, and Example 4.8 involves a problem in which we have unsteady ﬂow. VIDEO Momentum Effect: A Jet Impacting a Surface. 112 Chapter 4Basic Equations in Integral Form for a Control VolumeExample 4.4 CHOICE OF CONTROL VOLUME FOR MOMENTUM ANALYSIS Water from a stationary nozzle strikes a ﬂat plate as shown. The water leaves the nozzle at 15 m/s; the nozzle area is 0.01 m2. Assuming the water is directed normal to the plate, and ﬂows along the plate, determine the horizontal force you need to resistto hold it in place. Given: Water from a stationary nozzle is directed normal to the plate; subsequent ﬂow is parallel to plate. Jet velocity ;~V515^im=s Nozzle area ;A n50:01 m2 Find: Horizontal force on your hand. Solution: We chose a coordinate system in deﬁning the problem above. We must now choose a suitable control volume. Two possible choices are shown by the dashed lines below. In both cases, water from the nozzle crosses the control surface through area A1(assumed equal to the nozzle area) and is assumed to leave the control volume tangent to the plate surface in the 1yor2ydirection. Before trying to decide which is the “best” control volume to use, let us write the governing equations. ~F5~FS1~FB5@ @tZ CV~VρdV---1Z CS~Vρ~V/C1d~A and@ @tZ CVρdV---1Z CSρ~V/C1d~A50 Assumptions: (1) Steady ﬂow.

Regardless of our choice of control volume, assumptions (1), (2), and (3) lead to ~F5~FS1~FB5X CS~Vρ~V/C1~A andX CSρ~V/C1~A50 Evaluating the momentum ﬂux term will lead to the same result for both control volumes. We should choose the control volume that allows the most straightforward evaluation of the forces. Remember in applying the momentum equation that the force, ~F, represents all forces acting onthe control volume. Let us solve the problem using each of the control volumes. CV I The control volume has been selected so that the area of the left surface is equal to thearea of the right surface. Denote this area by A. The control volume cuts through your hand. We denote the components of the reac- tion force of your hand on the control volume as R xandRyand assume both to be positive. (The force of the control volume on your hand is equal and opposite to Rxand Ry.) Atmospheric pressure acts on all surfaces of the control volume. Note that the pressure in a free jet is ambient , i.e., in this case atmospheric.

Example 4.5 TANK ON SCALE: BODY FORCE A metal container 2 ft high, with an inside cross-sectional area of 1 ft2, weighs 5 lbf when empty. The container is placed on a scale and waterﬂows in through an opening in the top and out through the two equal-areaopenings in the sides, as shown in the diagram.

You disagree, claiming that a ﬂuid ﬂow analysis is required. Who is right, and what does the scale indicate? Given: Metal container, of height 2 f t and cross-sectional area A51f t2, weighs 5 lbf when empty. Container rests on scale. Under steady ﬂow conditions water depth is h51.9 ft.

The weight of the tank is designated Wtank; the weight of the water in the tank is W H2O. Atmospheric pressure acts uniformly on the entire control surface, and therefore has no net effect on the control volume. Because of this null effect we have not shown the pressure distribution in the diagram. Governing equations: The general control volume momentum and mass conservation equations are Eqs. 4.17 and 4.12, respectively, FS /H11001 FB /H11005 CV V dV /H11001 CS V V · dA/H11005 0(1) CV dV /H11001 CS V · dA /H11005 0/H11005 0(1)/H9267/H9267 /H9267/H9267/H20885/H20885 /H20885/H20885 Note that we usually start with the simplest forms (based on the problem assumptions, e.g., steady ﬂow) of the mass conservation and momentum equations. However, in this problem, for illustration purposes, we start with the mostgeneral forms of the equations. Assumptions: (1) Steady ﬂow (given). (2) Incompressible ﬂow.

We can see that the scale reading is due to: the tank weight (5 lbf), the weight of water instantaneously in the tank (118.6 lbf), and the force involved in absorbing the downwardmomentum of the ﬂuid at section 1(19.4 lbf).

At the inlet to the elbow, the absolute pressure is 220 kPa and the cross-sectional area is 0.01 m2. At the outlet, the cross-sectional area is 0.0025 m2and the velocity is 16 m/s. The elbow discharges to the atmosphere. Determine the force required to hold the elbow in place.

The exit at section 2is to a free jet, and so at ambient (i.e., atmospheric) pressure. We can use a simpliﬁcation here: If we subtract patmfrom the entire surface (a null effect as far as forces are concerned) we can work in gage pressures, as shown. Note that since the elbow is anchored to the supply line, in addition to the reaction forces RxandRy(shown), there would also be a reaction moment (not shown).

The sand falls vertically from the hopper to the belt at a speed of 5 ft/s and a ﬂow rate of 500 lbm/s (the density of sand is approximately 2700 lbm/cubic yard).The conveyor belt is initially empty but begins to ﬁll with sand.

If we apply the approach to a differential control volume, we can obtain differential equations describing a ﬂow ﬁeld. In this section, we will apply the conservation of mass and momentum equations to such a control volume to obtain a simple differ-ential equation describing ﬂow in a steady, incompressible, frictionless ﬂow, andintegrate it along a streamline to obtain the famous Bernoulli equation. Let us apply the continuity and momentum equations to a steady incompressible ﬂow without friction, as shown in Fig. 4.4 . The control volume chosen is ﬁxed in space and bounded by ﬂow streamlines, and is thus an element of a stream tube. The lengthof the control volume is ds. Because the control volume is bounded by streamlines, ﬂow across the bounding surfaces occurs only at the end sections. These are located at coordinates sands1ds, measured along the central streamline. Properties at the inlet section are assigned arbitrary symbolic values. Properties at the outlet section are assumed to increase by differential amounts. Thus at s1ds, the ﬂow speed is assumed to be V s1dVs, and so on. The differential changes, dp,dVs, and dA, all are assumed to be positive in setting up the problem. (As in a free-body analysis in statics or dynamics, the actual algebraic sign of each differential change willbe determined from the results of the analysis.) Now let us apply the continuity equation and the scomponent of the momentum equation to the control volume of Fig. 4.4 . a.

We have derived one form of perhaps the most famous (and misused) equation in ﬂuid mechanics—the Bernoulli equation. It can be used only when the four restric- tions listed above apply, at least to reasonable accuracy! Although no real ﬂow satisﬁes all these restrictions (especially the second), we can approximate the behaviorof many ﬂows with Eq. 4.24. For example, the equation is widely used in aerodynamics to relate the pressure and velocity in a ﬂow (e.g., it explains the lift of a subsonic wing). It could also be usedto ﬁnd the pressure at the inlet of the reducing elbow analyzed in Example 4.6 or todetermine the velocity of water leaving the sluice gate of Example 4.7 (both of theseﬂows approximately satisfy the four restrictions). On the other hand, Eq. 4.24 does not correctly describe the variation of water pressure in pipe ﬂow. According to it, for ahorizontal pipe of constant diameter, the pressure will be constant, but in fact the pressure drops signiﬁcantly along the pipe—we will need most of Chapter 8 to explain this. The Bernoulli equation, and the limits on its use, is so important we will derive it again and discuss its limitations in detail in Chapter 6.

Sup- pose we have a control volume moving at constant speed. We can set up two coor-dinate systems: XYZ , “absolute,” or stationary (and therefore inertial), coordinates, and the xyzcoordinates attached to the control volume (also inertial because the control volume is not accelerating with respect to XYZ ). Equation 4.10, which expresses system derivatives in terms of control volume variables, is valid for any motion of the control volume coordinate system xyz, pro- vided that all velocities are measured relative to the control volume. To emphasize this point, we rewrite Eq. 4.10 as dN dt/C19 system5@ @tZ CVηρdV---1Z CSηρ~Vxyz/C1d~A ð4:25Þ Since all velocities must be measured relative to the control volume, in using thisequation to obtain the momentum equation for an inertial control volume from the system formulation, we must set N5~P xyz and η5~Vxyz The control volume equation is then written as ~F5~FS1~FB5@ @tZ CV~VxyzρdV---1Z CS~Vxyzρ~Vxyz/C1d~A ð4:26Þ Equation 4.26 is the formulation of Newton’s second law applied to any inertial control volume (stationary or moving with a constant velocity). It is identical to Eq. 4.17a except that we have included subscript xyzto emphasize that velocities must be measured relative to the control volume. (It is helpful to imagine that the velocitiesare those that would be seen by an observer moving with the control volume.)Example 4.10 illustrates the use of Eq. 4.26 for a control volume moving at constantvelocity. Example 4.10 VANE MOVING WITH CONSTANT VELOCITY The sketch shows a vane with a turning angle of 60/C14. The vane moves at constant speed, U510 m =s, and receives a jet of water that leaves a stationary nozzle with speed V530 m =s. The nozzle has an exit area of 0.003 m2. Determine the force components that act on the vane. Given: Vane, with turning angle θ560/C14, moves with constant velocity, ~U510^im=s. Water from a constant area nozzle, A50:003 m2, with velocity ~V530^im=s, ﬂows over the vane as shown. Find: Force components acting on the vane. Solution: Select a control volume moving with the vane at constant velocity, ~U, as shown by the dashed lines. Rx andRyare the components of force required to maintain the velocity of the control volume at 10 ^im=s. The control volume is inertial, since it is not accelerating ( U5constant). Remember that all velocities must be measured relative to the control volume in applying the basic equations.UVθ= 60°126 Chapter 4Basic Equations in Integral Form for a Control VolumeGoverning equations: ~FS1~FB5@ @tZ CV~VxyzρdV---1Z CS~Vxyzρ~Vxyz/C1d~A @ @tZ CVρdV---1Z CSρ~Vxyz/C1d~A50 Assumptions: (1) Flow is steady relative to the vane.

Since we are interested in analyzing control volumes that mayaccelerate relative to inertial coordinates, it is logical to ask whether Eq. 4.26 can beused for an accelerating control volume. To answer this question, let us brieﬂy reviewthe two major elements used in developing Eq. 4.26. First, in relating the system derivatives to the control volume formulation (Eq. 4.25 or 4.10), the ﬂow ﬁeld, ~Vðx;y;z;tÞ, was speciﬁed relative to the control volume’s coordinates x,y, and z. No restriction was placed on the motion of the xyzreference frame. Consequently, Eq. 4.25 (or Eq. 4.10) is valid at any instant for any arbitrarymotion of the coordinates x,y, and zprovided that all velocities in the equation are measured relative to the control volume.

Thus, if we denote the inertial reference frame by XYZ , then Newton’s second law states that ~F5d~PXYZ dt! systemð4:27Þ Since the time derivatives of ~PXYZand ~Pxyzare not equal when the control volume reference frame xyzis accelerating relative to the inertial reference frame, Eq. 4.26 is not valid for an accelerating control volume. To develop the momentum equation for a linearly accelerating control volume, it is necessary to relate ~PXYZof the system to ~Pxyzof the system. The system derivative d~Pxyz=dtcan then be related to control volume variables through Eq. 4.25. We begin by writing Newton’s second law for a system, remembering that the acceleration must bemeasured relative to an inertial reference frame that we have designated XYZ.W ew r i t e ~F5d~PXYZ dt! system5d dtZ Mðsystem Þ~VXYZdm5Z Mðsystem Þd~VXYZ dtdm ð4:28Þ The velocities with respect to the inertial ( XYZ ) and the control volume coordi- nates ( xyz) are related by the relative-motion equation ~VXYZ5~Vxyz1~Vrf ð4:29Þ where ~Vrfis the velocity of the control volume coordinates xyzwith respect to the “absolute” stationary coordinates XYZ .

Substituting from Eq. 4.30 into Eq. 4.28 gives ~F5Z Mðsystem Þ~arfdm1Z Mðsystem Þd~Vxyz dtdm or ~F2Z Mðsystem Þ~arfdm5d~Pxyz dt! systemð4:31aÞ where the linear momentum of the system is given by ~PxyzÞsystem5Z Mðsystem Þ~Vxyzdm5Z V---ðsystem Þ~VxyzρdV--- ð4:31bÞ and the force, ~F, includes all surface and body forces acting on the system.4.5 Momentum Equation for Control Volume with Rectilinear Acceleration 129To derive the control volume formulation of Newton’s second law, we set N5~Pxyz and η5~Vxyz From Eq. 4.25, with this substitution, we obtain d~Pxyz dt! system5@ @tZ CV~VxyzρdV---1Z CS~Vxyzρ~Vxyz/C1d~A ð4:32Þ Combining Eq. 4.31a (the linear momentum equation for the system) and Eq. 4.32 (the system /C0control volume conversion), and recognizing that at time t0the system and control volume coincide, Newton’s second law for a control volume accelerating,without rotation, relative to an inertial reference frame is ~F2Z CV~arfρdV---5@ @tZ CV~VxyzρdV---1Z CS~Vxyzρ~Vxyz/C1d~A Since ~F5~FS1~FB, this equation becomes ~FS1~FB2Z CV~arfρdV---5@ @tZ CV~VxyzρdV---1Z CS~Vxyzρ~Vxyz/C1d~A ð4:33Þ Comparing this momentum equation for a control volume with rectilinear accelera-tion to that for a nonaccelerating control volume, Eq. 4.26, we see that the only dif-ference is the presence of one additional term in Eq. 4.33. When the control volume isnot accelerating relative to inertial reference frame XYZ , then ~a rf50, and Eq. 4.33 reduces to Eq. 4.26. The precautions concerning the use of Eq. 4.26 also apply to the use of Eq. 4.33. Before attempting to apply either equation, one must draw the boundaries of thecontrol volume and label appropriate coordinate directions. For an accelerating controlvolume, one must label two coordinate systems: one ( xyz) on the control volume and the other ( XYZ ) an inertial reference frame. In Eq. 4.33, ~F Srepresents all surface forces acting on the control volume. Since the mass within the control volume may vary with time, both the remaining terms onthe left side of the equation may be functions of time. Furthermore, the acceleration, ~a rf, of the reference frame xyzrelative to an inertial frame will in general be a function of time. All velocities in Eq. 4.33 are measured relative to the control volume. The momentum ﬂux, ~Vxyzρ~Vxyz/C1d~A, through an element of the control surface area, d~A, is a vector. As we saw for the nonaccelerating control volume, the sign of the scalarproduct, ρ~V xyz/C1d~A, depends on the direction of the velocity vector, ~Vxyz, relative to the area vector, d~A. The momentum equation is a vector equation. As with all vector equations, it may be written as three scalar component equations.

There are two obvious approaches we can use to express the angular-momentum principle: We can use an inertial (ﬁxed) XYZ control volume; we can also use a rotating xyzcontrol volume. For each approach we will: start with the principle in its system form (Eq. 4.3a), then write the system angular momentum in terms of XYZ or xyzcoordinates, and ﬁnally use Eq. 4.10 (or its slightly different form, Eq. 4.25) to convert from a system to a control volume formulation. To verify that these twoapproaches are equivalent, we will use each approach to solve the same problem, inExamples 4.14 and 4.15 (on the Web), respectively. There are two reasons for the material of this section: We wish to develop a control volume equation for each of the basic physical laws of Section 4.2; and we will needthe results for use in Chapter 10, where we discuss rotating machinery.

Reference frames at rest, or translating with constant linear velocity, are inertial, and Eq. 4.3b can be used directly to develop the control volume form of the angular-momentum principle.

The left side of the equation is an expression for all thetorques that act on the control volume. Terms on the right express the rate of changeof angular momentum within the control volume and the net rate of ﬂux of angular momentum from the control volume. All velocities in Eq. 4.46 are measured relative to the ﬁxed control volume. For analysis of rotating machinery, Eq. 4.46 is often used in scalar form by con- sidering only the component directed along the axis of rotation. This application isillustrated in Chapter 10. The application of Eq. 4.46 to the analysis of a simple lawn sprinkler is illustrated in Example 4.14. This same problem is considered in Example 4.15 (on the Web)using the angular-momentum principle expressed in terms of a rotating control volume.136 Chapter 4Basic Equations in Integral Form for a Control VolumeExample 4.14 LAWN SPRINKLER: ANALYSIS USING FIXED CONTROL VOLUME A small lawn sprinkler is shown in the sketch at right. At an inlet gage pressure of 20 kPa, the total volume ﬂow rate of water throughthe sprinkler is 7.5 liters per minute and it rotates at 30 rpm. Thediameter of each jet is 4 mm. Calculate the jet speed relative to eachsprinkler nozzle. Evaluate the friction torque at the sprinkler pivot. Given: Small lawn sprinkler as shown. Find: (a) Jet speed relative to each nozzle.

The moments of the body (i.e., gravity) forces in the two arms are equal and opposite and hence the second term on the left side of the equation is zero. The only external torque acting on the CV is friction in the pivot. It opposes the motion, so ~Tshaft52Tf^K ð2Þ Our next task is to determine the two angular momentum terms on the right side of Eq. 1. Consider the unsteadyterm: This is the rate of change of angular momentum in the control volume. It is clear that although the position ~rand velocity ~Vof ﬂuid particles are functions of time in XYZ coordinates, because the sprinkler rotates at constant speed the control volume angular momentum isconstant in XYZ coordinates, so this term is zero; however, as an exercise in manipulating vector quantities, let us derive this result. Before we can evaluate the control volumeintegral, we need to develop expressions for the instantaneous position vector, ~r, and velocity vector, ~V(measured relative to the ﬁxed coordinate system XYZ ) of each element of ﬂuid in the control volume. OAlies in the XYplane; ABis inclined at angle αto the XYplane; point Buis the projection of point Bon the XYplane. We assume that the length, L, of the tip ABis small compared with the length, R, of the horizontal arm OA. Consequently we neglect the angular momentum of the ﬂuid in the tips compared with the angular momentum in the horizontal arms.VrelVrel ω R = 150 mmQ = 7.5 L/min = 30 rpmωα= 30° psupply = 20 kPa (gage) VrelVrel Tfω R = 150 mmα= 30° psupply = 20 kPa (gage)CV OZ Y X O(Control volume is fixed wrt XYZ)Q = 7.5 L/min ω= 30 rpm4.7 The Angular-Momentum Principle 137Consider ﬂow in the horizontal tube OAof length R.

Identical results are obtained for the other horizontal tube in the control volume. We have conﬁrmed our insight that the angular momentum within the control volume does not change with time. Now we need to evaluate the second term on the right, the ﬂux of momentum across the control surface.

To obtain a formulation suitable and convenient for problem solutions, letus take a closer look at the work term, _W. Rate of Work Done by a Control Volume The term _Win Eq. 4.54 has a positive numerical value when work is done by the control volume on the surroundings. The rate of work done onthe control volume is of opposite sign to the work done bythe control volume. The rate of work done by the control volume is conveniently subdivided into four classiﬁcations, _W5 _Ws1 _Wnormal1 _Wshear1 _Wother Let us consider these separately: Shaft Work We shall designate shaft work Wsand hence the rate of work transferred out through the control surface by shaft work is designated _Ws. Examples of shaft work are the work produced by the steam turbine (positive shaft work) of a power plant, and the work inputrequired to run the compressor of a refrigerator (negative shaft work).140 Chapter 4Basic Equations in Integral Form for a Control Volume2.

Example 4.17 TANK FILLING: FIRST LAW ANALYSIS A tank of 0.1 m3volume is connected to a high-pressure air line; both line and tank are initially at a uniform temperature of 20/C14C. The initial tank gage pressure is 100 kPa. The absolute line pressure is 2.0 MPa; the line is large enough so that its temperature and pressure may be assumed constant. The tank temperature is monitored by a fast- response thermocouple. At the instant after the valve is opened, the tank temperature rises at the rate of 0.05/C14C/s.

We then developed an equation(sometimes called the Reynolds Transport Theorem) for relating system formulations to control volume formulations. Using this wederived control volume forms of: üThe mass conservation equation (sometimes called the continuity equation). üNewton’s second law (in other words, a momentum equation) for: *An inertial control volume. *A control volume with rectilinear acceleration. *A control volume with arbitrary acceleration (on the Web). üThe angular-momentum equation for:* *A ﬁxed control volume. *A rotating control volume (on the Web). üThe ﬁrst law of thermodynamics (or energy equation). üThe second law of thermodynamics. We discussed the physical meaning of each term appearing in these control volume equations, and used the equations for the solution of a variety of ﬂow problems. In particular, we used a differential control volume* toderive a famous equation in ﬂuid mechanics—the Bernoulli equation—and while doing so learned about therestrictions on its use in solving problems. *These topics apply to a section that may be omitted without loss of continuity in the text material4.10 Summary and Useful Equations 147Note: Most of the Useful Equations in the table below have a number of constraints or limitations— be sure to refer to their page numbers for details !

Rolling resistance and airresistance are negligible. As the speed of the ball increases, itCase Study “Lab-on-a-Chip” (a)( b)( c) Mixing two ﬂuids in a “lab-on-a-chip.” An exciting new area in ﬂuid mechanics is microﬂuidics, applied to microelectromechanical systems (MEMS—the technology of very small devices, generally ranging insize from a micrometer to a millimeter). In particular, a lotof research is being done in “lab-on-a-chip” technology,which has many applicati ons. An example of this is in medicine, with devices for use in the immediate point-of-care diagnosis of diseases, such as real-time detection of bacteria, viruses, and cancers in the human body. In the area of security, there are devices that continuouslysample and test air or water samples for biochemicaltoxins and other dangerous pathogens such as those inalways-on early warning systems. Because of the extremely small geometry, ﬂows in such devices will be very low Reynolds numbers andtherefore laminar; surface tension effects will also be signiﬁcant. In many common applications (for example,typical water pipes and air conditioning ducts), laminar ﬂow would be desirable, but the ﬂow is turbulent—it costs more to pump a turbulent as opposed to a laminar ﬂow. In certain applications , turbulence is desirable instead because it acts as a mixing mechanism. If youcouldn’t generate turbulence in your coffee cup, it wouldtake a lot of stirring before the cream and coffee weresufﬁciently blended; if your blood ﬂow never becameturbulent, you would not get sufﬁcient oxygen to yourorgans and muscles! In the lab-on-a-chip, turbulent ﬂow is usually desirable because the goal in these devices is often to mix minute amounts of two or more ﬂuids. H o wd ow em i xﬂ u i d si ns u c hd e v i c e st h a ta r ei n h e r - ently laminar? We could use complex geometries, or relatively long channels (rel ying on molecular diffusion), or some kind of MEM device with paddles. Research byprofessors Goullet, Glasgow, and Aubry at the New Jer-sey Institute of Technology instead suggests pulsing the two ﬂuids. Part aof the ﬁgure shows a schematic of two ﬂuids ﬂowing at a constant rate (about 25 nL/s, average velocity less than 2 mm/s, in ducts about 200 μmw i d e ) and meeting in a T junction. The two ﬂuids do not mixbecause of the strongly laminar nature of the ﬂow. Part b of the ﬁgure shows a schematic of an instant of a pulsedﬂow, and part cshows an instant computed using a computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) model of the same ﬂow. In this case, the interface between the two ﬂuid samples is shown to stretch and fold, leading to goodnonturbulent mixing within 2 mm downstream ofthe conﬂuence (after about 1 s of contact). Such acompact mixing device would be ideal for many of theapplications mentioned above.Problems 149eventually leaves the surface of the pipe and becomes a projectile.

Considering the auditorium and people asa system, and assuming no heat transfer to the surroundings, how much does the internal energy of the system change? How do you account for the fact that the temperature of the airincreases?

They eventually plan to have commerciallyviable Oyster wave farms around the world, the ﬁrst planned for 2013. A farm of 20 Oyster devices would provide enough energy to power 9000 homes, off-setting carbon emissions of about 20,000 metric tons. The Oyster device consists of a simple mechanical hinged ﬂap, as shown in the ﬁgure, connected to theseabed at around a 10-m depth. As each wave passesby, it forces the ﬂap to move; the ﬂap in turn drives 171In Chapter 4, we developed the basic equations in integral form for a control volume. Integral equations are useful when we are interested in the gross behavior of a ﬂowﬁeld and its effect on various devices. However, the integral approach does not enableus to obtain detailed point-by-point knowledge of the ﬂow ﬁeld. For example, theintegral approach could provide information on the lift generated by a wing; it couldnot be used to determine the pressure distribution that produced the lift on the wing. To see what is happening in a ﬂow in detail, we need differential forms of the equations of motion. In this chapter we shall develop differential equations for theconservation of mass and Newton’s second law of motion. Since we are interested indeveloping differential equations, we will need to analyze inﬁnitesimal systems andcontrol volumes. 5.1Conservation of Mass In Chapter 2, we developed the ﬁeld representation of ﬂuid properties. The propertyﬁelds are deﬁned by continuous functions of the space coordinates and time. Thedensity and velocity ﬁelds were related through conservation of mass in integral formin Chapter 4 (Eq. 4.12). In this chapter we shall derive the differential equation forhydraulic pistons to deliver high-pressure water, via apipeline, to an onshore electrical turbine. Oyster farms using multiple devices are expected to be capable ofgenerating 100 MW or more. Oyster has a number of advantages: It has good efﬁ- ciency and durability, and, with its low-cost operation,maintenance, and manufacture, it is hoped it willproduce reliable cost-competitive electricity from the waves for the ﬁrst time. The device uses simple androbust mechanical offshore component, combined withproven conventional onshore hydroelectric compo-nents. Designed with the notion that simple is best, less is more, it has a minimum of offshore submerged movingparts; there are no underwater generators, power elec- tronics, or gearboxes. The Oyster is designed to take advantage of the more consistent waves found near theshore; for durability, any excess energy from excep- tionally large waves simply spills over the top of Oyster ’s ﬂap. Its motion allows it to literally duck under such waves. Aquamarine Power believes its device is com- petitive with devices weighing up to ﬁve times as much,and, with multiple pumps feeding a single onshoregenerator, Oyster will offer good economies of scale. As a ﬁnal bonus, Oyster uses water instead of oil as its hydraulic ﬂuid for minimum environmental impact and generates essentially no noise pollution.

The density at the center, O, of the control volume is assumed to be ρand the velocity there is assumed to be ~V5^iu1^jv1^kw.

This will allow us to represent two entities—the velocity compo- nents u(x,y,t) and v(x,y,t) of a two-dimensional incompressible ﬂow—with a single function ψ(x,y,t). There are various ways to deﬁne the stream function. We start with the two- dimensional version of the continuity equation for incompressible ﬂow (Eq. 5.1c): @u @x1@v @y50 ð5:3Þ We use what looks at ﬁrst like a purely mathematical exercise (we will see a physical basis for it later) and deﬁne the stream function by u/C17@ψ @yand v/C172@ψ @xð5:4Þ so that Eq. 5.3 is automatically satisﬁed for anyψ(x,y,t) we choose! To see this, use Eq. 5.4 in Eq. 5.3: @u @x1@v @y5@2ψ @x@y2@2ψ @y@x50 Using Eq. 2.8, we can obtain an equation valid only along a streamline udy2vdx50 or, using the deﬁnition of our stream function, @ψ @xdx1@ψ @ydy50 ð5:5Þ On the other hand, from a strictly mathematical point of view, at any instant in time t the variation in a function ψ(x,y,t) in space ( x,y) is given by dψ5@ψ @xdx1@ψ @ydy ð5:6Þ Comparing Eqs. 5.5 and 5.6, we see that along an instantaneous streamline, dψ50; in other words, ψis a constant along a streamline . Hence we can specify individual streamlines by their stream function values: ψ50, 1, 2, etc. What is the signiﬁcance of theψvalues? The answer is that they can be used to obtain the volume ﬂow rate between any two streamlines. Consider the streamlines shown in Fig. 5.3 . We can compute the volume ﬂow rate between streamlines ψ1andψ2by using line AB,BC, DE,o rEF(recall that there is no ﬂow across a streamline). Let us compute the ﬂow rate by using line AB, and also by using line BC—they should be the same! For a unit depth (dimension perpendicular to the xyplane), the ﬂow rate across ABis Q5Zy2 y1ud y5Zy2 y1@ψ @ydy VIDEO An Example of Streamlines/Streaklines. 5.2 Stream Function for Two-Dimensional Incompressible Flow 181But along AB,x5constant, and (from Eq. 5.6) dψ5@ψ/@yd y.

Therefore, Q52Zx2 x1@ψ @xdx52Zψ1 ψ2dψ5ψ22ψ1 Hence, whether we use line ABor line BC(or for that matter lines DEorDF), we ﬁnd that the volume ﬂow rate (per unit depth) between two streamlines is given by the difference between the two stream function values .2(The derivations for lines ABand BCare the justiﬁcation for using the stream function deﬁnition of Eq. 5.4.) If the streamline through the origin is designated ψ50, then the ψvalue for any other streamline represents the ﬂow between the origin and that streamline. [We are free to select any streamline as the zero streamline because the stream function is deﬁned as a differential (Eq. 5.3); also, the ﬂow rate will always be given by a difference ofψ values.] Note that because the volume ﬂow between any two streamlines is constant, the velocity will be relati vely high where ver the streamlines are close together, and relati vely low where ver the streamlines are far apart —a very useful concept for “eyeballing” velocity ﬁelds to see where we have regions of high or low velocity.

We will examine the inﬁnitesimal particle so that we will eventually obtainresults applicable to a point. We can decompose this particle’s motion into four components: translation , in which the particle moves from one point to another; rotation of the particle, which can occur about any or all of the x,yorzaxes; linear deformation , in which the particle’s sides stretch or contract; and angular deformation , in which the angles (which were initially 90 /C14for our particle) between the sides change. It may seem difﬁcult by looking at Fig. 5.4 to distinguish between rotation and angular deformation of the inﬁnitesimal ﬂuid particle. It is important to do so, because pure rotation involves no deformation but angular deformation does and, as we learned in Chapter 2, ﬂuid deformation generates shear stresses. Figure 5.5 shows a typical xyplane motion decomposed into the four components described above, and as we examine each of these four components in turn we will see that we candis- tinguish between rotation and angular deformation. Fluid Translation: Acceleration of a Fluid Particle in a Velocity Field The translation of a ﬂuid particle is obviously connected with the velocity ﬁeld ~V5~Vðx;y;z;tÞthat we previously discussed in Section 2.2. We will need the accel- eration of a ﬂuid particle for use in Newton’s second law. It might seem that we could simply compute this as ~a5@~V=@t. This is incorrect, because ~Vis a ﬁeld, i.e., it describes the whole ﬂow and not just the motion of an individual particle. (We can seethat this way of computing is incorrect by examining Example 5.4, in which particlesare clearly accelerating and decelerating so ~a6¼0, but @~V=@t50.) The problem, then, is to retain the ﬁeld description for ﬂuid properties and obtain an expression for the acceleration of a ﬂuid particle as it moves in a ﬂow ﬁeld.

As an alternative (e.g., if we wish to track an individual particle’s motion in, for example, pollution studies) we sometimes use the Lagrangian description of particle motion, in which the acceleration, position, and velocity of a particle are speciﬁed as a function of time only.

Thus particle rotation is a vector quantity and, in general, ~ω5^iωx1^jωy1^kωz where ωxis the rotation about the xaxis, ωyis the rotation about the yaxis, and ωzis the rotation about the zaxis. The positive sense of rotation is given by the right-hand rule. We now see how we can extract the rotation component of the particle motion. Consider the xyplane view of the particle at time t. The left and lower sides of the particle are given by the two perpendicular line segments oaandobof lengths Δx andΔy, respectively, shown in Fig. 5.7 a. In general, after an interval Δtthe particle will have translated to some new position, and also have rotated and deformed.A possible instantaneous orientation of the lines at time t1Δtis shown in Fig. 5.7 b. We need to be careful here with our signs for angles. Following the right-hand rule, counterclockwise rotation is positive , and we have shown side oarotating counter- clockwise through angle Δα, but be aware that we have shown edge obrotating at aclockwise angleΔβ. Both angles are obviously arbitrary, but it will help visualize the discussion if we assign values to these angles, e.g., let Δα56 /C14andΔβ54/C14. How do we extract from ΔαandΔβa measure of the particle’s rotation? The answer is that we take an average of the rotations ΔαandΔβ, so that the particle’s rigid body counterclockwise rotation is1 2(Δα2Δβ), as shown in Fig. 5.7 c. The minus sign is needed because the counterclockwise rotation of obis2Δβ. Using the assigned values, the rotation of the particle is then12(6/C1424/C14)51/C14. (Given the two rotations, taking the average is the only way we can measure the particle’s rotation, because any other approach would favor one side’s rotation over the other, whichdoesn’t make sense.)Then, from Eq. 2, azpðt50Þ5V2 1 L; and axpt5L V1lnð2Þ0 @1A5 V2 1 Lelnð2Þ52V2 1 Lßaxp Note that both approaches yield the same results for particle acceleration, as they should.This prob lem illustratesuseoftheEulerian andLagrangiandescriptionsofthemoti onofaﬂuidparticle. b oaΔy ΔxΔaΔhΔbΔj 1/2(Δa – Δb) 1/2(Δa – Δb)1/2(Δa + Δb) 1/2(Δa + Δb) (a) Original particle (b) Particle after time Δt (c) Rotational component (d) Angular deformation component Fig. 5.7 Rotation and angular deformation of perpendicular line segments in a two-dimensional ﬂow.190 Chapter 5Introduction to Differential Analysis of Fluid MotionNow we can determine from ΔαandΔβa measure of the particle’s angular deformation, as shown in Fig. 5.7 d. To obtain the deformation of side oain Fig. 5.7 d, we use Fig. 5.7 band 5.7 c: If we subtract the particle rotation1 2(Δα2Δβ), in Fig. 5.7 c, from the actual rotation of oa,Δα, in Fig. 5.7 b, what remains must be pure defor- mation [ Δα21 2(Δα2Δβ)512(Δα1Δβ), in Fig. 5.7 d]. Using the assigned values, the deformation of side oais 6/C14212(6/C1424/C14)55/C14. By a similar process, for side obwe end withΔβ212(Δα2Δβ)5212(Δα1Δβ), or a clockwise deformation12(Δα1Δβ), as shown in Fig. 5.7 d. The total deformation of the particle is the sum of the deforma- tions of the sides, or ( Δα1Δβ) (with our example values, 10/C14). We verify that this leaves us with the correct value for the particle’s deformation: Recall that in Section 2.4 we saw that deformation is measured by the change in a 90/C14angle. In Fig. 5.7 awe see this is angle aob, and in Fig. 5.7 dwe see the total change of this angle is indeed 1 2(Δα1Δβ)112(Δα1Δβ)5(Δα1Δβ). We need to convert these angular measures to quantities obtainable from the ﬂow ﬁeld. To do this, we recognize that (for small angles) Δα5Δη=Δx, and Δβ5Δξ=Δy. ButΔξarises because, if in interval Δtpoint omoves horizontally distance uΔt, then point bwill have moved distance ðu1½@u=@y/C138ΔyÞΔt(using a Taylor series expansion).

As we will see in Example 5.6, in s u c haﬂ o wt h ep a r t i c l e s could rotate as they move in a circular motion, but they do not have to! When might we expect to have a ﬂow in which the particles rotate as they move (~ω6¼0)? One possibility is that we start out with a ﬂow in which (for whatever reason) the particles already have rotation. On the other hand, if we assumed theparticles are not initially rotating, particles will only begin to rotate if they experiencea torque caused by surface shear stresses; the particle body forces and normal(pressure) forces may accelerate and deform the particle, but cannot generate a torque. We can conclude that rotation of ﬂuid particles will always occur for ﬂows in which we have shear stresses. We have already learned in Chapter 2 that shear stresses are present whenever we have a viscous ﬂuid that is experiencing angulardeformation (shearing). Hence we conclude that rotation of ﬂuid particles only occursin viscous ﬂows 4(unless the particles are initially rotating, as in Example 3.10). Flows for which no particle rotation occurs are called irrotational ﬂows. Although no real ﬂow is truly irrotational (all ﬂuids have viscosity), it turns out that many ﬂowscan be successfully studied by assuming they are inviscid and irrotational, because viscous effects are often negligible. As we discussed in Chapter 1, and will again in Chapter 6, much of aerodynamics theory assumes inviscid ﬂow. We just need to beaware that in any ﬂow there will always be regions (e.g., the boundary layer for ﬂowover a wing) in which viscous effects cannot be ignored. The factor of 1 2can be eliminated from Eq. 5.14 by deﬁning the vorticity ,~ζ,t ob e twice the rotation, ~ζ/C172~ω5r3~V ð5:15Þ The vorticity is a measure of the rotation of a ﬂuid element as it moves in the ﬂow ﬁeld.

We can develop a relationship between circulation and vorticity byconsidering the rectangular circuit shown in Fig. 5.8 , where the velocity components atoare assumed to be ( u,v), and the velocities along segments bcandaccan be derived using Taylor series approximations. 4A rigorous proof using the complete equations of motion for a ﬂuid particle is given in Li and Lam, pp. 142 /C0145. 5In carrying out the curl operation, recall that ˆerandˆeθare functions of θ(see footnote 1 on p. 178).

Streamlines for the two vortex ﬂows are shown below, along with the location and orientation at differentinstants of a cross marked in the ﬂuid that was initially at the 12 o’clock position. For the rigid-body motion(which occurs, for example, at the eye of a tornado, creating the “dead” region at the very center), the crossrotates as it moves in a circular motion; also, the streamlines are closer together as we move away fromthe origin. For the irrotational motion (which occurs, for example, outside the eye of a tornado—in such a large region viscous effects are negligible), the cross does not rotate as it moves in a circular motion; also, the streamlines are farther apart as we move away from the origin.

Linear Deformation During linear deformation, the shape of the ﬂuid element, described by the angles at its vertices, remains unchanged, since all right angles continue to be right angles (see Fig. 5.5 ). The element will change length in the xdirection only if @u/@xis other than zero. Similarly, a change in the ydimension requires a nonzero value of @v/@yand a change in the zdimension requires a nonzero value of @w/@z.

We shall consider the xcomponent of the force acting on a differential element of mass dmand volume dV---5dx dy dz . Only those stresses that act in the xdirection will give rise to surface forces in the xdirection.

Before the equations can be used to solve for u,v, and w, suitable expressions for the stresses must be obtained in terms of the velocity andpressure ﬁelds. Newtonian Fluid: Navier /C0Stokes Equations For a Newtonian ﬂuid the viscous stress is directly proportional to the rate of shearingstrain (angular deformation rate). We saw in Chapter 2 that for one-dimensionallaminar Newtonian ﬂow the shear stress is proportional to the rate of angular defor-mation: τ yx5du/dy(Eq. 2.15). For a three-dimensional ﬂow the situation is a bit more complicated (among other things we need to use the more complicated expressions forrate of angular deformation, Eq. 5.19). The stresses may be expressed in terms ofvelocity gradients and ﬂuid properties in rectangular coordinates as follows: 6 6The derivation of these results is beyond the scope of this book. Detailed derivations may be found in Daily and Harleman [2], Schlichting [3], and White [4].5.4 Momentum Equation 199τxy5τyx5μ@v @x1@u @y/C18/C19 ð5:25aÞ τyz5τzy5μ@w @y1@v @z/C18/C19 ð5:25bÞ τzx5τxz5μ@u @z1@w @x/C18/C19 ð5:25cÞ σxx52p22 3μr/C1~V12μ@u @xð5:25dÞ σyy52p223μr/C1~V12μ@v @yð5:25eÞ σzz52p223μr/C1~V12μ@w @zð5:25fÞ where pis the local thermodynamic pressure.7Thermodynamic pressure is related to the density and temperature by the thermodynamic relation usually called the equation of state.

These equations, with the continuity equation (Eq. 5.1c), form a set of fourcoupled nonlinear partial differential equations for u,v,w,a n d p. In principle, these four equations describe many common ﬂows; the only restrictions are that the ﬂuid beNewtonian (with a constant viscosity) and incompressible. For example, lubricationtheory (describing the behavior of machine bearings), pipe ﬂows, and even the motionof your coffee as you stir it are explained by these equations. Unfortunately, they are impossible to solve analytically, except for the most basic cases [3], in which we have simple boundaries and initial or boundary conditions! We will solve the equations forsuch a simple problem in Example 5.9. The Navier /C0Stokes equations for constant density and viscosity are given in cylindrical coordinates in Appendix B; they have also been derived for sphericalcoordinates [3]. We will apply the cylindrical coordinate form in solving Example 5.10. In recent years computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) computer applications (such asFluent [6] and STAR-CD [7]) have been developed for analyzing the Navier /C0 Stokes equations for more complicated, real-world problems. Although a detailedtreatment of the topic is beyond the scope of this text, we shall have a brief intro-duction to CFD in the next section. For the case of frictionless ﬂow ( μ50) the equations of motion (Eqs. 5.26 or Eqs. 5.27) reduce to Euler’s equation , ρ D~V Dt5ρ~g2rp We shall consider the case of frictionless ﬂow in Chapter 6.

The assumptions are discussed in the order in which they are applied to simplify the equations. Assumptions: (1) Steady ﬂow (given). (2) Incompressible ﬂow; ρ5constant. (3) No ﬂow or variation of properties in the zdirection; w50 and @/@z50. (4) Fully developed ﬂow, so no properties vary in the xdirection; @/@x50. Assumption (1) eliminates time variations in any ﬂuid property. Assumption (2) eliminates space variations in density.Assumption (3) states that there is no zcomponent of velocity and no property variations in the zdirection.

Assumptions (3) and (4) also indicate that @v/@z50 and @v/@x50. Therefore vmust be constant. Since vis zero at the solid surface, then vmust be zero everywhere.

We will ﬁrst review some very basic ideas in numerically solv- ing an ordinary and a partial differential equation using a spreadsheet such as Excel , with a couple of Examples. After studying these, the reader will be able to use the PC to numerically solve a range of simple CFD problems. Then, for those with furtherinterest in CFD, we will review in more detail some concepts behind numericalmethods, particularly CFD; this review will highlight some of the advantages andpitfalls of CFD. We will apply some of these concepts to a simple 1D model, but theseconcepts are so fundamental that they are applicable to almost any CFD calculation. As we apply the CFD solution procedure to the model, we’ll comment on the extension to the general case. The goal is to enable the reader to apply the CFDsolution procedure to simple nonlinear equations. The Need for CFD As discussed in Section 5.4, the equations describing ﬂuid ﬂow can be a bit intimi-dating. For example, even though we may limit ourselves to incompressible ﬂows forwhich the viscosity is constant, we still end up with the following equations: @u @x1@v @y1@w @z50 ð5:1cÞ ρ@u @t1u@u @x1v@u @y1w@u @z/C18/C19 5ρgx2@p @x1μ@2u @x21@2u @y21@2u @z2/C18/C19 ð5:27aÞ ρ@v @t1u@v @x1v@v @y1w@v @z/C18/C19 5ρgy2@p @y1μ@2v @x21@2v @y21@2v @z2/C18/C19 ð5:27bÞ ρ@w @t1u@w @x1v@w @y1w@w @z/C18/C19 5ρgz2@p @z1μ@2w @x21@2w @y21@2w @z2/C18/C19 ð5:27cÞ Equation 5.1c is the continuity equation (mass conservation) and Eqs. 5.27 are theNavier /C0Stokes equations (momentum), expressed in Cartesian coordinates. In prin- ciple, we can solve these equations for the velocity ﬁeld ~V5^iu1^jv1^kwand pressure ﬁeld p, given sufﬁcient initial and boundar y conditions. Note that in general, u,v,w,a n d pall depend on x,y,z,a n d t. In practice, there is no general analytic solution to these equations, for the combined effect of a number of reasons (none ofwhich is insurmountable by itself): 1.They are coupled. The unknowns, u,v,w,a n dp, appear in all the equations ( pis not in Eq. 5.1c) and we cannot manipulate the equations to end up with a singleequation for any one of the unknowns. Hence we must solve for all unknownssimultaneously. 2.They are nonlinear. For example, in Eq. 5.27a, the convective acceleration term,u@u=@x1v@u=@y1w@u=@z, has products of uwith itself as well as with vandw. The consequence of this is that we cannot take one solution to the equations andcombine it with a second solution to obtain a third solution. We will see in Chapter 6that if we can limit ourselves to frictionless ﬂow, we canderive linear equations, which will allow us to do this combining procedure (you may wish to look at Table 6.3 forsome beautiful examples of this). *This section may be omitted without loss of continuity in the text material.208 Chapter 5Introduction to Differential Analysis of Fluid Motion3.They are second-order partial differential equations. For example, in Eq. 5.27a, the viscous term, μð@2u=@x21@2u=@y21@2u=@z2Þ, is second-order in u. These are obviously of a different order of complexity (no pun intended) than, say, a ﬁrst- order ordinary differential equation. These difﬁculties have led engineers, scientists, and mathematicians to adopt several approaches to the solution of ﬂuid mechanics problems. For relatively simple physical geometries and boundary or initial conditions, the equations can often be reduced to a solvable form. We saw two examples of this inExamples 5.9 and 5.10 (for cylindrical forms of the equations). If we can neglect the viscous terms, the resulting incompressible, inviscid ﬂow can often be successfully analyzed. This is the entire topic of Chapter 6. Of course, most incompressible ﬂows of interest do not have simple geometries and are not inviscid; for these, we are stuck with Eqs. 5.1c and 5.27. The only optionremaining is to use numerical methods to analyze problems. It is possible to obtainapproximate computer-based solutions to the equations for a variety of engineering problems. This is the main subject matter of CFD. Applications of CFD CFD is employed in a variety of applications and is now widely used in various industries. To illustrate the industrial applications of CFD, we present below someexamples developed using FLUENT, a CFD software package from ANSYS, Inc.CFD is used to study the ﬂow ﬁeld around vehicles including cars, trucks, airplanes,helicopters, and ships. Figure 5.10 shows the paths taken by selected ﬂuid particles around a Formula 1 car. By studying such pathlines and other ﬂow attributes, engi-neers gain insights into how to design the car so as to reduce drag and enhance performance. The ﬂow through a catalytic converter, a device used to clean auto- motive exhaust gases so that we can all breathe easier, is shown in Figure 5.11.This image shows path lines colored by velocity magnitude. CFD helps engineersdevelop more effective catalytic converters by allowing them to study how differentchemical species mix and react in the device. Figure 5.12 presents contours of static pressure in a backward-inclined centrifugal fan used in ventilation applications. Fig. 5.10 Pathlines around a Formula 1 car.

VIDEO Flow Past a Cylinder. 5.5 Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics 209Fan performance characteristics obtained from the CFD simulations compared well with results from physical tests. CFD is attractive to industry since it is more cost-effective than physical testing. However, we must note that complex ﬂow simulations are challenging and error-prone, and it takes a lot of engineering expertise to obtain realistic solutions. Some Basic CFD/Numerical Methods Using a Spreadsheet Before discussing CFD in a little more detail, we can gain insight into numericalmethods to solve some simple problems in ﬂuid mechanics by using the spreadsheet.These methods will show how the student may perform elementary CFD using thePC. First, we consider solving the simplest form of a differential equation: a ﬁrst-orderordinary differential equation: dy dx5fðx;yÞyðx0Þ5y0 ð5:28Þ where f(x,y) is a given function. We realize that graphically the derivative dy/dxis the slope of the (as yet unknown) solution curve y(x). If we are at some point ( xn,yn)o n the curve, we can follow the tangent at that point, as an approximation to actually moving along the curve itself, to ﬁnd a new value for y,yn+1, corresponding to a new x, xn+1, as shown in Fig. 5.13 . We have dy dx5yn112yn xn112xn If we choose a step size h 5xn+12xn, then the above equation can be combined with the differential equation, Eq. 5.28, to give dydx5yn112yn h5fðxn;ynÞ or yn115yn1hfðxn;ynÞ ð5:29aÞ with xn115xn1h ð5:29bÞ Equations 5.29 are the basic concept behind the famous Euler method for solving a ﬁrst-order ODE: A differential is replaced with a ﬁnite difference. (As we’ll see in thenext subsection, equations similar to Eqs. 5.29 could also have been derived moreformally as the result of a truncated Taylor series.) In these equations, y n+1now represents our best effort to ﬁnd the next point on the solution curve. From Fig. 5.13,we see that y n+1isnoton the solution curve but close to it; if we make the triangle Fig. 5.12 Static pressure contours for ﬂow through a centrifugal fan. (image courtesy of ANSYS, Inc. ª2008.)210 Chapter 5Introduction to Differential Analysis of Fluid Motionmuch smaller, by making the step size hsmaller, then yn+1will be even closer to the desired solution. We can repeatedly use the two Euler iteration equations to start at (x0,y0) and obtain ( x1,y1), then ( x2,y2), (x3,y3), and so on. We don’t end up with an equation for the solution, but with a set of numbers; hence it is a numerical rather thanan analytic method. This is the Euler method approach. This method is very easy to set up, making it an attractive approach, but it is not very accurate: Following the tangent to a curve at each point, in an attempt tofollow the curve, is pretty crude! If we make the step size hsmaller, the accuracy of the method will generally increase, but obviously we then need more steps toachieve the solution. It turns out that, if we use too many steps (if his extremely small), the accuracy of the results can actually decrease because, although each small step is very accurate, we will now need so many of them that round-off errors can buildup. As with any numerical method, we are not guaranteed to get a solution or one that is very accurate! The Euler method is the simplest but least accurate numerical method for solving a ﬁrst-order ODE; there are a number of more sophisticated ones available,as discussed in any good numerical methods text [8, 9]. Let’s illustrate the method with an Example. Example 5.11 THE EULER METHOD SOLUTION FOR DRAINING A TANK A tank contains water at an initial depth y051 m. The tank diameter is D5250 mm.

These seem like a severe set of restrictions on the ﬂow, but analysis of ﬂows with these assumptions leads to very good predictions for real ﬂows, for example, for the lift on a wing section. This is the topic of Chapter 6, but for now we simply state that under many circum-stances such ﬂows can be modeled with the Laplace equation, @2ψ @x21@2ψ @y250 where ψis the stream function. We leave out the steps here (they consist of approximating each differential with a Taylor series), but a numerical approximationof this equation is ψi11;j1ψi21;j h21ψi;j111ψi;j21 h224ψi;j h250 Here his the step size in the xorydirection, and ψi,jis the value of ψat the ith value ofxandjth value of y(see Fig. 5.14 ).

To use this equation, we need to specify the values of the stream function at all boundaries; Eq. 5.30 then allows computation of interior values. Equation 5.30 is ideal for solving using a spreadsheet such as Excel . We again consider an Example. Example 5.12 NUMERICAL MODELING OF FLOW OVER A CORNER Consider a two-dimensional steady, incompressible, inviscid ﬂow in a channel inwhich the area is reduced by half. Plot the streamlines.

Each cell in the spreadsheet represents a location in physical space, and the value in the cell represents the value of the stream function ψat that location. Referring to the ﬁgure, we assign values of zero to a range of cells that represent the bottom of the channel. We then assign a value of 10 to a second range of cells to represent the top of the channel. (The choice of 10 is arbitrary for plotting purposes; all it determines is the speed values, not the streamline shapes.) Next, we assign a uniform dis-tribution of values at the left and right ends, to generate uniform ﬂow at those locations. All inserted values areshown in bold in the ﬁgure. We can now enter formulas in the “interior” cells to compute the stream function. Instead of the above governing equation, it is more intuitive to rephrase it as ψ5 1 4ðψA1ψR1ψB1ψLÞ where ψA,ψR,ψB,a n dψ Lrepresent the values stored in the cells Above, to the Right, Below, and to the Left of the current cell. This formula is easy to enter— it is shown in cell C5 in the ﬁgure. Then it is copied into all interior cells, with one caveat: The spreadsheet will indicate an error of circular calculation. This is a warning that you appear to be 214 Chapter 5Introduction to Differential Analysis of Fluid MotionExamples 5.11 and 5.12 provide guidance in using the PC to solve some simple CFD problems. We now turn to a somewhat more detailed description of some of the concepts behind CFD. The Strategy of CFD Broadly, the strategy of CFD is to replace the continuous problem domain with a discrete domain using a “grid” or “mesh.” In the continuous domain, each ﬂowvariable is deﬁned at every point in the domain. For instance, the pressure pin the continuous 1D domain shown in Fig. 5.15 would be given as p5pðxÞ; 0#x#1 In the discrete domain, each ﬂow variable is deﬁned only at the grid points. So, in thediscrete domain in Fig. 5.15 , the pressure would be deﬁned only at the Ngrid points, p i5pðxiÞ;i51;2;...;N We can extend this continuous-to-discrete conversion to two or three dimensions. Figure 5.16 shows a 2D grid used for solving the ﬂow over an airfoil. The grid points are the locations where the grid lines cross. In a CFD solution, we would directly solve for the relevant ﬂow variables only at the grid points. The values at other locations are determinedby interpolating the values at the grid points. The governing partial differential equationsand boundary conditions are deﬁned in terms of the continuous variables p,~V, and so on. We can approximate these in the discrete domain in terms of the discrete variables p i,~Vi, and so on. Using this procedure, we end up with a discrete system that consists of a large setof coupled, algebraic equations in the discrete variables. Setting up the discrete system and solving it (which is a matrix inversion problem) involves a very large number of repetitive calculations, a task made possible only with the advent of modern computers.

Recall that each interior cell value is the average of its neighbors. Circular math is usually not what we want, but in this case we do wish it to occur. We need to switch on iteration in the spreadsheet. In the case of Excel , it’s under menu item Tools /Options /Calculation. Finally, we need to repeatedly iterate (in Excel, press the F9 key several times) until we have convergence; the values in the interior cells will repeatedly update until the variations in values is zero or trivial. After all this, the results can beplotted (using a surface plot), as shown. We can see that the streamlines look much as we would anticipate, although in reality there would probably be ﬂow separation at the corner. Note also a mathematical artifact in that there is slight oscillations of streamlines as they ﬂow up the vertical surface; using a ﬁner grid (byusing many more cells) would reduce this.This Exampleshowsasimplenumer-icalmodelingoftheLaplaceequation. The Exce lworkbookforthis prob lem canbemodi ﬁed forsolvingavarietyofﬂuidsproblemsthatinvolvetheLaplaceequation.5.5 Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics 215Discretization Using the Finite-Difference Method To keep the details simple, we will illustrate the process of going from the continuous domain to the discrete domain by applying it to the following simple 1D equation: du dx1um50; 0#x#1; uð0Þ51 ð5:31Þ We’ll ﬁrst consider the case where m51, which is the case when the equation is linear. We’ll later consider the nonlinear case m52. Keep in mind that the above problem is an initial-value problem, while the numerical solution procedure below is more suitablefor boundary-value problems. Most CFD problems are boundary-value problems. We’ll derive a discrete representation of Eq. 5.31 with m51 on the rudimentary grid shown in Fig. 5.17 . This grid has four equally spaced grid points, with Δx5 1 3being the spacing between successive points. Since the governing equation is valid at any grid point, we have du dx/C18/C19 i1ui50 ð5:32Þ where the subscript irepresents the value at grid point xi. In order to get an expression for (du/dx)iin terms of uvalues at the grid points, we expand ui21in a Taylor series: ui215ui2du dx/C18/C19 iΔx1d2u dx2/C18/C19 iΔx2 22d3u dx3/C18/C19 iΔx3 61/C1/C1/C1x1 = 0 x4 = 1/H9004x = x2 =1___ 31___ 3 x3 =2___ 3 Fig. 5.17 A simple 1D grid with four grid points.Fig. 5.16 Example of a grid used to solve for the ﬂow around an airfoil.216 Chapter 5Introduction to Differential Analysis of Fluid MotionRearranging this gives du dx/C18/C19 i5ui2ui21 Δx1d2u dx2/C18/C19 iΔx 22d3u dx3/C18/C19 iΔx2 61/C1/C1/C1 ð5:33Þ We’ll neglect the second-, third-, and higher-order terms on the right. Thus, the ﬁrst term on the right is the ﬁnite-difference representation for ( du/dx)iwe are seeking. The error in ( du/dx)idue to the neglected terms in the Taylor series is called the truncation error . In general, the truncation error is the difference between the dif- ferential equation and its ﬁnite-difference representation. The leading-order term inthe truncation error in Eq. 5.33 is proportional to Δx. Equation 5.33 is rewritten as du dx/C18/C19 i5ui2ui21 Δx1OðΔxÞ ð5:34Þ where the last term is pronounced “order of delta x.” The notation O(Δx)h a sa precise mathematical meaning, which we will not go into here. Instead, in the interestof brevity, we’ll return to it brieﬂy later when we discuss the topic of grid convergence.Since the truncation error is proportional to the ﬁrst power of Δx, this discrete representation is termed ﬁrst-order accurate . Using Eq. 5.34 in Eq. 5.32, we get the following discrete representation for our model equation: ui2ui21 Δx1ui50 ð5:35Þ Note that we have gone from a differential equation to an algebraic equation! Thoughwe have not written it out explicitly, don’t forget that the error in this representation isO(Δx). This method of deriving the discrete equation using Taylor’s series expansions is called the ﬁnite-difference method. Keep in mind that most industrial CFD software packages use the ﬁnite-volume orﬁnite-element discretization methods since they are better suited to modeling ﬂow past complex geometries. We will stick with the ﬁnite-difference method in this text since it is the easiest to understand; the concepts dis-cussed also apply to the other discretization methods. Assembly of Discrete System and Application of Boundary Conditions Rearranging the discrete equation, Eq. 5.35, we get 2ui211ð11ΔxÞui50 Applying this equation at grid points i52, 3, 4 for the 1D grid in Fig. 5.17 gives 2u11ð11ΔxÞu250 ð5:36aÞ 2u21ð11ΔxÞu350 ð5:36bÞ 2u31ð11ΔxÞu450 ð5:36cÞ The discrete equation cannot be applied at the left boundary ( i51) since ui215u0is not deﬁned. Instead, we use the boundary condition to get u151 ð5:36dÞ5.5 Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics 217Equations 5.36 form a system of four simultaneous algebraic equations in the four unknowns u1,u2,u3, and u4. It’s convenient to write this system in matrix form: 1 000 2111Δx 00 0211 1Δx 0 00 211 1Δx2 6643 775u1 u2 u3 u42 6643 77551 0002 6643 775ð5:37Þ In a general situation (e.g., 2D or 3D domains), we would apply the discrete equations to the grid points in the interior of the domain. For grid points at or near theboundary, we would apply a combination of the discrete equations and boundaryconditions. In the end, one would obtain a system of simultaneous algebraic equationssimilar to Eqs. 5.36 and a matrix equation similar to Eq. 5.37, with the number ofequations being equal to the number of independent discrete variables. The process is essentially the same as for the model equation above, with the details obviously being much more complex. Solution of Discrete System The discrete system (Eq. 5.37) for our own simple 1D example can be easily inverted,using any number of techniques of linear algebra, to obtain the unknowns at the grid points. For Δx5 1 3, the solution is u151u253 4u359 16u452764 The exact solution for Eq. 5.31 with m51 is easily shown to be u exact5e2x Figure 5.18 shows the comparison of the discrete solution obtained on the four-point grid with the exact solution, using Excel. The error is largest at the right boundary, where it is equal to 14.7 percent. [It also shows the results using eight points ( N58, Δx51 7) and sixteen points ( N516,Δx51 15), which we discuss below.] In a practical CFD application, we would have thousands, even millions, of unknowns in the discrete system; if one were to use, say, a Gaussian elimination procedure to invert the calculations, it would be extremely time-consuming even witha fast computer. Hence a lot of work has gone into optimizing the matrix inversion in 0.9 0.81 0.7 0.60.50.40.3 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0N = 4 N = 8N = 16Exact solution xu Fig. 5.18 Comparison of the numerical solution obtained on three different grids with the exact solution.218 Chapter 5Introduction to Differential Analysis of Fluid Motionorder to minimize the CPU time and memory required. The matrix to be inverted is sparse; that is, most of the entries in it are zeros. The nonzero entries are clusteredaround the diagonal since the discrete equation at a grid point contains only quantities at the neighboring grid points, as shown in Eq. 5.37. A CFD code would store only the nonzero values to minimize memory usage. It would also generally use an iterativeprocedure to invert the matrix; the longer one iterates, the closer one gets to the truesolution for the matrix inversion. We’ll return to this idea a little later. Grid Convergence While developing the ﬁnite-difference approximation for the 1D model problem(Eq. 5.37), we saw that the truncation error in our discrete system is O(Δ x). Hence we expect that as the number of grid points is increased and Δxis reduced, the error in the numerical solution would decrease and the agreement between the numerical andexact solutions would get better. Let’s consider the effect of increasing the number of grid points Non the numerical solution of the 1D problem. We’ll consider N58 and N516 in addition to the N54 case solved previously. We repeat the above assembly and solution steps on each ofthese additional grids; instead of the 4 34 problem of Eq. 5.37, we end up with an 8 38 and a 16 316 problem, respectively. Figure 5.18 compares the results obtained (using Excel ) on the three grids with the exact solution. As expected, the numerical error decreases as the number of grid points is increased (but this only goes so far—if wemakeΔxtoo small, we start to get round-off errors accumulating to make the results get worse!). When the numerical solutions obtained on different grids agree to within alevel of tolerance speciﬁed by the user, they are referred to as “grid-converged” solu- tions. It is very important to investigate the effect of grid resolution on the solution in all CFD problems. We should never trust a CFD solution unless we are convinced that the solution is grid-converged to an acceptance level of tolerance (which will be problemdependent). Letεbe some aggregate measure of the error in the numerical solution obtained on a speciﬁc grid. For the numerical solutions in Fig. 5.19 ,εis, for instance, estimated as the RMS of the difference between the numerical and exact solutions: ε5ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ PN i51ðui2uiexactÞ2 Nvuuut 0.1 0.01 0.001 0.1 1 0.01Actual error Least squares fit /H9004xε Fig. 5.19 The variation of the aggregate error εwithΔx.5.5 Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics 219It’s reasonable to expect that ε~Δxn Since the truncation error is O( Δx) for our discretization scheme, we expect n51 (or more precisely, n-1a sΔx-0). The εvalues for the three grids are plotted on a logarithmic scale in Fig. 5.19 . The slope of the least squares ﬁt gives the value of n. For Fig. 5.19, we get n50.92, which is quite close to 1. We expect that as the grid is reﬁned further and Δxbecomes progressively smaller, the value of nwill approach 1. For a second-order scheme, we would expect nB2; this means the discretization error will decrease twice as fast on reﬁning the grid. Dealing with Nonlinearity The Navier /C0Stokes equations (Eqs. 5.27) contain nonlinear convection terms; for example, in Eq. 5.27a, the convective acceleration term, u@u=@x1v@u=@y1w@u=@z, has products of uwith itself as well as with vandw. Phenomena such as turbulence and chemical reaction introduce additional nonlinearities. The highly nonlinear na- ture of the governing equations for a ﬂuid makes it challenging to obtain accuratenumerical solutions for complex ﬂows of practical interest. We will demonstrate the effect of nonlinearity by setting m52 in our simple 1D example, Eq. 5.31: du dx1u250;0#x#1;uð0Þ51 A ﬁrst-order ﬁnite-difference approximation to this equation, analogous to that in Eq.5.35 for m51, is ui2ui21 Δx1u2 i50 ð5:38Þ This is a nonlinear algebraic equation with the u2 iterm being the source of the nonlinearity. The strategy that is adopted to deal with nonlinearity is to linearize the equations around a guess value of the solution and to iterate until the guess agrees with the solution to a speciﬁed tolerance level. We’ll illustrate this on the above example. Let ugibe the guess for ui. Deﬁne Δui5ui2ugi Rearranging and squaring this equation gives u2 i5u2g i12ugiΔui1ðΔuiÞ2 Assuming that Δui/C28ugi, we can neglect the ðΔuiÞ2term to get u2i/C25u2g i12ugiΔui5u2g i12ugiðui2ugiÞ Thus u2 i/C252ugiui2u2g ið5:39Þ The ﬁnite-difference approximation, Eq. 5.38, after linearization in ui, becomes ui2ui21 Δx12ugiui2u2 gi50 ð5:40Þ220 Chapter 5Introduction to Differential Analysis of Fluid MotionSince the error due to linearization is O( Δu2), it tends to zero as ug-u. In order to calculate the ﬁnite-difference approximation, Eq. 5.40, we need guess values ugat the grid points. We start with an initial guess value in the ﬁrst iteration. For each subsequent iteration, the uvalue obtained in the previous iteration is used as the guess value. We continue the iterations until they converge. We’ll defer the dis- cussion on how to evaluate convergence until a little later. This is essentially the process used in CFD codes to linearize the nonlinear terms in the conservation equations, with the details varying depending on the code. Theimportant points to remember are that the linearization is performed about a guessand that it is necessary to iterate through successive approximations until the itera-tions converge. Direct and Iterative Solvers We saw that we need to perform iterations to deal with the nonlinear terms in thegoverning equations. We next discuss another factor that makes it necessary to carryout iterations in practical CFD problems. As an exercise, you can verify that the discrete equation system resulting from the ﬁnite-difference approximation of Eq. 5.40, on our four-point grid, is 10 0 0 21112Δxu g200 0 211 12Δxug30 00 211 12Δxug42 6643 775u1 u2 u3 u42 6643 77551 Δxu2 g2 Δxu2g 3 Δxu2g 42 66643 7775ð5:41Þ In a practical problem, one would usually have thousands to millions of grid points or cells so that each dimension of the above matrix would be of the order of a million (with most of the elements being zeros). Inverting such a matrix directly would take aprohibitively large amount of memory, so instead the matrix is inverted using aniterative scheme as discussed below. Rearrange the ﬁnite-difference approximation, Eq. 5.40, at grid point iso that u iis expressed in terms of the values at the neighboring grid points and the guess values: ui5ui211Δxu2 gi 112Δxugi If a neighboring value at the current iteration level is not available, we use the guess value for it. Let’s say that we sweep from right to left on our grid; that is, we update u4, then u3, and ﬁnally u2in each iteration. In any iteration, ui21is not available while updating uiand so we use the guess value ugi21for it instead: ui5ugi211Δxu2 gi 112Δxugið5:42Þ Since we are using the guess values at neighboring points, we are effectively obtaining only an approximate solution for the matrix inversion in Eq. 5.41 during each itera-tion, but in the process we have greatly reduced the memory required for the inver-sion. This trade-off is a good strategy since it doesn’t make sense to expend a greatdeal of resources to do an exact matrix inversion when the matrix elements depend on guess values that are continuously being reﬁned. We have in effect combined the iteration to handle nonlinear terms with the iteration for matrix inversion into asingle iteration process. Most importantly, as the iterations converge and u g-u, the approximate solution for the matrix inversion tends towards the exact solution forthe inversion, since the error introduced by using u ginstead of uin Eq. 5.42 also tends5.5 Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics 221to zero. We arrive at the solution without explicitly forming the matrix system (Eq. 5.41), which greatly simpliﬁes the computer implementation. Thus, iteration serves two purposes: 1.It allows for efﬁcient matrix inversion with greatly reduced memory requirements. 2.It enables us to solve nonlinear equations. In steady problems, a common and effective strategy used in CFD codes is to solve the unsteady form of the governing equations and “march” the solution in timeuntil the solution converges to a steady value. In this case, each time step is effectively an iteration, with the guess value at any time level being given by the solution at the previous time level. Iterative Convergence Recall that as ug-u, the linearization and matrix inversion errors tend to zero. Hence we continue the iteration process until some selected measure of the differencebetween u gandu, referred to as the residual, is “small enough.” We could, for instance, deﬁne the residual Ras the RMS value of the difference between uandugon the grid: R/C17ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ PN i51ðui2ugiÞ2 Nvuuut It’s useful to scale this residual with the average value of uin the domain. Scaling ensures that the residual is a relative rather than an absolute measure. Scaling the above residual by dividing by the average value of ugives R5ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ PN i51ðui2ugiÞ2 Nvuuut0 BBBB@1 CCCCAN PN i51ui0 BBB@1 CCCA5ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ NPN i51ðui2ugiÞ2s PN i51uið5:43Þ In our nonlinear 1D example, we’ll take the initial guess at all grid points to be equal to the value at the left boundary, that is, uð1Þ g51 (whereð1Þsigniﬁes the ﬁrst iteration). In each iteration, we update ug, sweep from right to left on the grid updating, in turn, u4,u3, and u2using Eq. 5.42, and calculate the residual using Eq. 5.43. We’ll terminate the iterations when the residual falls below 1029(this is referred to as the convergence criterion ). The variation of the residual with iterations is shown in Fig. 5.20 . Note that a logarithmic scale is used for the ordinate. The iterative process converges to a levelsmaller than 10 29in only six iterations. In more complex problems, many more iterations would be necessary for achieving convergence. The solution after two, four, and six iterations and the exact solution are shown in Fig. 5.21 . It can easily be veriﬁed that the exact solution is given by uexact51 x11 The solutions for four and six iterations are indistinguishable on the graph. This is another indication that the solution has converged. The converged solution doesn’t agree well with the exact solution because we are using a coarse grid for which thetruncation error is relatively large (we will repeat this problem with ﬁner grids asproblems at the end of the chapter). The iterative convergence error, which is of order10 29, is swamped by the truncation error, which is of order 1021. So driving the residual down to 1029when the truncation error is of order 1021is obviously a waste222 Chapter 5Introduction to Differential Analysis of Fluid Motionof computing resources. In an efﬁcient calculation, both errors would be set at com- parable levels, and less than a tolerance level that was chosen by the user. Theagreement between the numerical and exact solutions should get much better onreﬁning the grid, as was the linear case (for m51). Different CFD codes use slightly different deﬁnitions for the residual. You should always read the documentation fromthe application to understand how the residual is calculated. Concluding Remarks In this section we have introduced some simple ways of using a spreadsheet for thenumerical solution of two types of ﬂuid mechanics problems. Examples 5.11 and 5.12 show how certain 1D and 2D ﬂows may be computed. We then studied some concepts in more detail, such as convergence criteria, involved with numerical methods andCFD, by considering a ﬁrst-order ODE. In our simple 1D example, the iterationsconverged very rapidly. In practice, one encounters many instances when the iterativeprocess doesn’t converge or converges lethargically. Hence, it’s useful to know a priori the conditions under which a given numerical scheme converges. This is determinedby performing a stability analysis of the numerical scheme. Stability analysis ofnumerical schemes and the various stabilization strategies used to overcome non- convergence are very important topics and necessary for you to explore if you decide to delve further into the topic of CFD.Iterations = 2 Iterations = 4Iterations = 6Exact solution 1 0.2 0.4 xu 0.6 0.8 00.50.60.70.80.91 Fig. 5.21 Progression of the iterative solution.0.1 0.01 0.0011 0.0001 1E-05 1E-06 1E-07 1E-091E-08 1E-10 1 2 34 56 0 IterationsResidual R Fig. 5.20 Convergence history for the model nonlinear problem.5.5 Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics 223Many engineering ﬂows are turbulent, characterized by large, nearly random ﬂuc- tuations in velocity and pressure in both space and time. Turbulent ﬂows often occur in the limit of high Reynolds numbers. For most turbulent ﬂows, it is not possible to resolve the vast range of time and length scales, even with powerful computers. Instead, one solves for a statistical average of the ﬂow properties. In order to do this, it is necessary toaugment the governing equations with a turbulence model. Unfortunately, there is nosingle turbulence model that is uniformly valid for all ﬂows, so most CFD packages allowyou to choose from among several models. Before you use a turbulence model, you needto understand its possibilities and limitations for the type of ﬂow being considered. In this brief introduction we have tried to explain some of the concepts behind CFD. Because it is so difﬁcult and time consuming to develop CFD code, most engineers use commercial packages such as Fluent [6] and STAR-CD [7]. This introduction will have hopefully indicated for you the complexity behind those applications, so that they are not completely a “black box” of magic tricks.

We have also explored such ideas as how to determine whether a ﬂow is incompressible by using the velocity ﬁeld and, given one velocity component of a two-dimensional incompressible ﬂow ﬁeld, how to derive the other velocity component. In this chapter we studied the effects of viscous stresses on ﬂuid particle deformation and rotation; in the next chapter we examine ﬂows for which viscous effects are negligible.

(Courtesy ofSpeedo and Fluent Inc.) Athletes in many competitive sports are using tech- nology to gain an advantage. In recent years, Fast- skinsfabric has been developed by Speedo. This material allows the lowest-drag racing swimwear in the world to be developed. The fabric mimics therough denticles of sharks’ skin to reduce drag in key areas of the body. (Shark scales are tiny compared with those of most ﬁshes and have a toothlike struc-ture, called dermal denticles—literally, “tiny skinteeth.” These denticles are nature’s way of reducingdrag on the shark.) Detailed design of swimsuits wasbased on tests in a water ﬂume and on computationalﬂuid dynamics (CFD) analyses. The ﬁgure shows anexample of the results obtained. To optimize the suits, the results were used to guide the position of the seams; gripper panels on the underside of the fore-arms; and “vortex” riblets on the chest, shoulders,and back of the suit—as well as the positioning ofdifferent patches of fabric and fabric coatings. The same technology is now being used to make outﬁts for athletes in the bobsled and luge events inthe winter Olympics. The fabric has been modiﬁed, based on wind tunnel tests, to reduce drag based on the airﬂow direction unique to sledding sports. Thenew outﬁts also eliminate most of the fabric vibration(a major source of drag) found in other speed suits. For both summer and winter sports, the ability to perform experimental and theoretical ﬂuid dynamicsanalysis and make design changes based on these canmake the difference in speed of several percent—the difference between silver and gold!226 Chapter 5Introduction to Differential Analysis of Fluid Motionandyare measured in feet.

A Cartesian coordinate system with its origin positioned at thecenter of the microchannel is used in the study. The micro- channel is ﬁlled with a weakly conductive solution. When an electric current is applied across the two conductive walls, thecurrent density, ~J, transmitted through the solution is parallel to the yaxis. The entire device is placed in a constant magnetic ﬁeld, ~B, which is pointed outward from the plane (the z direction), as shown. Interaction between the current density and the magnetic ﬁeld induces a Lorentz force of density ~J3~B. Assume that the conductive solution is incompressible, and since the sample volume is very small in lab-on-a-chipapplications, the gravitational body force is neglected. Under steady state, the ﬂow driven by the Lorentz force is describedby the continuity (Eq. 5.1a) and Navier /C0Stokes equations (Eqs. 5.27), except the x,y, and zcomponents of the latter have extra Lorentz force components on the right.

In continuous-ﬂow PCR reactors, the temperatures of the three thermal zones are maintained as ﬁxed while the reagents are cycled con- tinuously through these zones. These temperature variations induce signiﬁcant variations in the ﬂuid density, which underappropriate conditions can be used to generate ﬂuid motion.

Assume the channel wall is negativelycharged, a thin layer called the electric double layer (EDL) forms in the vicinity of the channel wall in which the number of positive ions is much larger than that of the negative ions.The net positively charged ions in the EDL then drag the electrolyte solution along with them and cause the ﬂuid to ﬂow toward the cathode. The thickness of the EDL is typicallyon the order of 10 nm. When the channel dimensions aremuch larger than the thickness of EDL, there is a slip velocity, y2 εζ μ~E, on the channel wall, where εis the ﬂuid permittivity, ζis the negative surface electric potential, ~Eis the electric ﬁeld intensity, and μis the ﬂuid dynamic viscosity. Consider a microchannel formed by two parallel plates. The walls of the channel have a negative surface electric potential of ζ. The microchannel is ﬁlled with an electrolyte solution, and themicrochannel ends are subjected to an electric potential dif-ference that gives rise to a uniform electric ﬁeld strength of E along the xdirection. The pressure gradient in the channel is zero. Derive the velocity of the steady, fully developed elec-tro-osmotic ﬂow. Compare the velocity proﬁle of the EOF tothat of pressure-driven ﬂow.

Many ideas are being explored (some of which we have discussed earlier) for extracting thisenergy, from tethered buoys to articulated mechanisms.Technical issues are rapidly being resolved with many ofthese devices, but the Achilles heel of each of them ismaking the technologies work at a cost, for the powerproduced, that the consumer is willing to pay. Long-term, fossil fuels will become more expensive, and wavepower will fall in cost, but we are not yet at the cross- over point. In the 1980s, wind power had the same kind of difﬁculty, but after several countries initiallysubsidized the industry, it is now becoming very 235In Chapter 5 we devoted a great deal of effort to deriving the differential equations (Eqs. 5.24) that describe the behavior of any ﬂuid satisfying the continuum assump- tion. We also saw how these equations reduced to various particular forms—the most well known being the Navier /C0Stokes equations for an incompressible, constant viscosity ﬂuid (Eqs. 5.27). Although Eqs. 5.27 describe the behavior of common ﬂuids(e.g., water, air, lubricating oil) for a wide range of problems, as we discussed incost-competitive. As with wind power, initial capitalcosts typically account for more than 90 percent of the cost of producing wave power; for fossil fuel plants the fuel supply itself is an ongoing part of the cost. Tosucceed, wave energy device developers have focusedon driving down the initial capital costs. The Voith Hydro Wavegen Limited company has been making big efforts in analyzing the costs andbeneﬁts of wave power with their Limpet (Land Installed Marine Powered Energy Transformer) device, shown in the photograph. This device was designedto be placed in onshore areas of high wave activity; inthe long term, such devices will be designed for thehigher-energy offshore regions. It is not a particularlyimpressive-looking device, but it has some interestingfeatures. It looks like just a concrete block, but in factis hollow and open to the sea on the underside,creating a trapped-air chamber; attached to it is an air turbine. It works pretty much like the swimming pool wave machine used at many amusement parks, exceptit runs in reverse. In these machines, air is blown inand out of a chamber beside the pool, which makesthe water outside bob up and down, causing waves.For the Limpet, the arriving waves cause water in thechamber to rise and fall, which in turn compresses andexpands the air trapped in the Limpet. If this is all we had, we would just have a device in which the water waves repeatedly compress and expand the trappedair. The clever innovation of the Limpet device is that aspecially designed turbine is attached to the airchamber, so that the air ﬂows through it ﬁrst one way and then the other, extracting power. The Wells turbine (developed by Professor Alan Wells of Queen’s Uni- versity, Belfast) is a low-pressure air turbine that rotatescontinuously in one direction in spite of the direction ofthe air ﬂow driving it. Its blades feature a symmetricalairfoil with its plane of symmetry in the plane of rotationand perpendicular to the air stream. Use of this bidir-ectional turbine allows power to be extracted as the air ﬂows in andout of the chamber, avoiding the need for an expensive check valve system. The trade-off for the bidirectional turbine is that its efﬁciency is lower thanthat of a turbine with a constant air stream direction.However, the turbine is very simple and rugged: Theblades are ﬁxed onto the rotor and have no pitch-adjusting mechanism or gearbox and make no contactwith the seawater. Turbines are discussed in some detail in Chapter 10, and some design concepts behind airfoil blade design in Chapter 9. The whole device—concrete chamber, Wells tur- bine, and associated electronics—is rugged, inexpen-sive, and durable, so the goal of minimizing the initialcapital cost is close to being realized. The technologyused is called OSW (oscillating water column). A new project involving the installation of 16 turbines into a breakwater off the coast of Spain is being constructed and is intended to supply green electricity to around250 households with a rated power of nearly 300 kW.

For example, even using the equations to predict the motion of your coffee asyou slowly stir it would require the use of an advanced computational ﬂuid dynamics computer application, and the prediction would take a lot longer to compute than the actual stirring! In this chapter, instead of the Navier /C0Stokes equations, we will study Euler’s equation, which applies to an inviscid ﬂuid.

Equations 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 apply to problems in which there are no viscous stresses. Before continuing with the main topic of this chapter (inviscid ﬂow), let’s consider for a moment when we have no viscous stresses, other than when μ50. We recall from previous discussions that, in general, viscous stresses are present when we have ﬂuid deformation (in fact this is how we initially deﬁned a ﬂuid); when we have noﬂuid deformation, i.e., when we have rigid-body motion, no viscous stresses will be present, even if μ6¼0. Hence Euler’s equations apply to rigid-body motions as well as to inviscid ﬂows. We discussed rigid-body motion in detail in Section 3.7 as a specialcase of ﬂuid statics. As an exercise, you can show that Euler’s equations can be used tosolve Examples 3.9 and 3.10. 6.2 Euler's Equations in Streamline Coordinates In Chapters 2 and 5 we pointed out that streamlines, drawn tangent to the velocityvectors at every point in the ﬂow ﬁeld, provide a convenient graphical representation.In steady ﬂow a ﬂuid particle will move along a streamline because, for steady ﬂow,pathlines and streamlines coincide. Thus, in describing the motion of a ﬂuid particle ina steady ﬂow, in addition to using orthogonal coordinates x,y,z, the distance along a streamline is a logical coordinate to use in writing the equations of motion.“Streamline coordinates” also may be used to describe unsteady ﬂow. Streamlines inunsteady ﬂow give a graphical representation of the instantaneous velocity ﬁeld. For simplicity, consider the ﬂow in the yzplane shown in Fig. 6.1 . We wish to write the eq uations of motion in terms of the coordinate s, distance along a streamline, and the coordinate n, distance normal to the streamline. The pressure at the center of the ﬂuid element is p. If we apply Newton’s second law in the direction sof the streamline, to the ﬂuid element of volume ds dn dx , then neglecting viscous forces we obtain p2@p @sds 2/C18/C19 dn dx2p1@p @sds 2/C18/C19 dn dx2ρgsinβds dn dx 5ρasds dn dx where βis the angle between the tangent to the streamline and the horizontal, and as is the acceleration of the ﬂuid particle along the streamline.

This makes sense: The only force experienced by the particle is the net pressure force, so the particle accelerates toward low-pressure regions and decelerates when approaching high-pressure regions. To obtain Euler’s equation in a direction normal to the streamlines, we apply Newton’s second law in the ndirection to the ﬂuid element. Again, neglecting viscous forces, we obtain p2@p @ndn 2/C18/C19 ds dx2p1@p @ndn 2/C18/C19 ds dx2ρgcosβdn dx ds 5ρandn dx ds where βis the angle between the ndirection and the vertical, and anis the acceleration of the ﬂuid particle in the ndirection.

This also makes sense: Because the only force experienced by the particle is the net pressure force, the pressure ﬁeld creates the centripetal acceleration. In regions where the streamlines are straight, the radius ofcurvature, R, is inﬁnite so there is no pressure variation normal to straight streamlines . Example 6.1 FLOW IN A BEND The ﬂow rate of air at standard conditions in a ﬂat duct is to be determined by installing pressure taps across a bend. The duct is 0.3 m deep and 0.1 m wide. The inner radius of the bend is 0.25 m. If the measured pressure difference between the taps is 40 mm of water, compute the approximate ﬂow rate.

One convenient approach for asteady ﬂow is to integrate Euler’s equation along a streamline. We will do this belowusing two different mathematical approaches, and each will result in the Bernoulli equation. Recall that in Section 4.4 we derived the Bernoulli equation by starting with a differential control volume; these two additional derivations will give us moreinsight into the restrictions inherent in use of the Bernoulli equation. *Derivation Using Streamline Coordinates Euler’s equation for steady ﬂow along a streamline (from Eq. 6.4a) is 21 ρ@p @s2g@z @s5V@V @sð6:6Þ If a ﬂuid particle moves a distance, ds, along a streamline, then @p @sds5dp the change in pressure along s ðÞ @z @sds5dz the change in elevation along s ðÞ @V @sds5dV the change in speed along s ðÞ Thus, after multiplying Eq. 6.6 by ds, we can writeButΔp5p22p15ρH2OgΔh,s o V5ρH2OgΔh ρlnðr2=r1Þ/C20/C21 1=2 Substituting numerical values, V5999kg m339:81m s230:04 m3m3 1:23 kg31 lnð0:35 m =0:25 mÞ2 4351=2 530:8m=s For uniform ﬂow Q5VA530:8m s30:1m30:3m Q50:924 m3=sßQInthis problemweassumed thatthevelocityis uniformacrossthesecti on.Infact,thevelocityinthebendapproximatesafree vortex(irrota-tional)proﬁleinwhichV~1/r(whereristheradius)inste adofV5const.Hence,this ﬂow- measurementdevicecouldonlybeusedtoobtainapprox-imate values oftheﬂow rate (seeProblem6.32).6.3 Bernoulli Equation: Integration of Euler’s Equation Along a Streamline for Steady Flow 2412dp ρ2gd z5Vd V ordp ρ1Vd V1gd z50 along s ðÞ Integration of this equation gives Zdp ρ1V2 21gz5constant ðalong sÞ ð6:7Þ Before Eq. 6.7 can be applied, we must specify the relation between pressure and de nsity. For the special case of incompressible ﬂow, ρ5constant, and Eq. 6.7 becomes the Bernoulli equation, p ρ1V2 21gz5constant ð6:8Þ Restrictions: (1) Steady ﬂow. (2) Incompressible ﬂow. (3) Frictionless ﬂow.(4) Flow along a streamline. The Bernoulli equation is probably the most famous, and abused, equation in all of ﬂuid mechanics. It is always tempting to use because it is a simple algebraic equationfor relating the pressure, velocity, and elevation in a ﬂuid. For example, it is used toexplain the lift of a wing: In aerodynamics the gravity term is usually negligible, so Eq.6.8 indicates that wherever the velocity is relatively high (e.g., on the upper surface ofa wing), the pressure must be relatively low, and wherever the velocity is relativelylow (e.g., on the lower surface of a wing), the pressure must be relatively high, gen- erating substantial lift. Equation 6.8 indicates that, in general (if the ﬂow is not constrained in some way), if a particle increases its elevation ( zm) or moves into a higher pressure region ( pm), it will tend to decelerate ( Vk); this makes sense from a momentum point of view (recall that the equation was derived from momentumconsiderations). These comments only apply if the four restrictions listed are rea- sonable. For example, Eq. 6.8 cannot be used to explain the pressure drop in a hor-izontal constant diameter pipe ﬂow: according to it, for z5constant and V5constant, p5constant! We cannot stress enough that you should keep the restrictions ﬁrmly in mind whenever you consider using the Bernoulli equation ! (In general, the Bernoulli constant in Eq. 6.8 has different values along different streamlines. 1) *Derivation Using Rectangular Coordinates The vector form of Euler’s equation, Eq. 6.1, also can be integrated along a stream-line. We shall restrict the derivation to steady ﬂow; thus, the end result of our effort should be Eq. 6.7.

During time interval dtthe particle has vector displacement d~salong the streamline. If we take the dot product of the terms in Eq. 6.9 with displacement d~salong the streamline, we obtain a scalar equation relating pressure, speed, and elevation along the streamline.

The Bernoulli equation, derivedusing rectangular coordinates, is still subject to the restrictions: (1) steady ﬂow, (2) incompressible ﬂow, (3) frictionless ﬂow, and (4) ﬂow along a streamline. Static, Stagnation, and Dynamic Pressures The pressure, p, which we have used in deriving the Bernoulli equation, Eq. 6.8, is the thermodynamic pressure; it is commonly called the static pressure . The static pressure is the pressure experienced by the ﬂuid particle as it moves (so it is something of amisnomer!)—we also have the stagnation and dynamic pressures, which we will deﬁne shortly. How do we measure the pressure in a ﬂuid in motion? In Section 6.2 we showed that there is no pressure variation normal to straight streamlines. This fact makes it possible to measure the static pressure in a ﬂowing ﬂuidusing a wall pressure “tap,” placed in a region where the ﬂow streamlines are straight,as shown in Fig. 6.2 a. The pressure tap is a small hole, drilled carefully in the wall, with its axis perpendicular to the surface. If the hole is perpendicular to the duct wall andfree from burrs, accurate measurements of static pressure can be made by connecting the tap to a suitable pressure-measuring instrument [1]. In a ﬂuid stream far from a wall, or where streamlines are curved, accurate static pre ssure measurements can be made by careful use of a static pressure probe, shown in Fig. 6.2 b. Such probes must be designed so that the measuring holes are placed correctly with respect to the probe tip and stem to avoid erroneous results [2]. In use, the measuring section must be aligned with the local ﬂow direction. (In these ﬁgures, itmay appear that the pressure tap and small holes would allow ﬂow to enter or leave orotherwise be entrained by the main ﬂow, but each of these is ultimately attached to a pressure sensor or manometer and is therefore a dead-end, leading to no ﬂow being possible—see Example 6.2.) Pressure tapFlow streamlines (a) Wall pressure tap (b) Static pressure probeFlowSmall holes Stem To manometer or pressure gage Fig. 6.2 Measurement of static pressure.244 Chapter 6Incompressible Inviscid FlowStatic pressure probes, such as that shown in Fig 6.2 b, and in a variety of other forms, are available commercially in sizes as small as 1.5 mm (1 16in.) in diameter [3]. The stagnation pressure is obtained when a ﬂowing ﬂuid is decelerated to zero speed by a frictionless process. For incompressible ﬂow, the Bernoulli equation can be used to relate changes in speed and pressure along a streamline for such a process.Neglecting elevation differences, Eq. 6.8 becomes p ρ1V2 25constant If the static pressure is pat a point in the ﬂow where the speed is V, then the stag- nation pressure, p0, where the stagnation speed, V0, is zero, may be computed from /H11005 0 p0/H11001/H9267V0 2/H11005p/H11001/H9267V2 22 or p05p11 2ρV2ð6:11Þ Equation 6.11 is a mathematical statement of the deﬁnition of stagnation pressure, valid for incompressible ﬂow. The term1 2ρV2generally is called the dynamic pressure . Equation 6.11 states that the stagnation (or total) pressure equals the static pressure plus the dynamic pressure. One way to picture the three pressures is to imagine you are standing in a steady wind holding up your hand: The static pressure will be atmo- spheric pressure; the larger pressure you feel at the center of your hand will be the stagnation pressure; and the buildup of pressure (the difference between the stagnationand static pressures) will be the dynamic pressure. Solving Eq. 6.11 for the speed, V5ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2ðp02pÞ ρs ð6:12Þ Thus, if the stagnation pressure and the static pressure could be measured at a point,Eq. 6.12 would give the local ﬂow speed. Stagnation pressure is measured in the laboratory using a probe with a hole that faces directly upstream as shown in Fig. 6.3 . Such a probe is called a stagnation pressur e probe, or pitot (pronounced pea-toe ) tube. Again, the measuring section must be aligned with the local ﬂow direction. We have seen that static pressure at a point can be measured with a static pressure tap or probe (Fig. 6.2 ). If we knew the stagnation pressure at the same point, then the ﬂow speed could be computed from Eq. 6.12. Two possible experimental setups are shown in Fig. 6.4. In Fig. 6.4 a, the static pressure corresponding to point Ais read from the wall static pressure tap. The stagnation pressure is measured directly at Aby the total head tube, Flow To manometer or pressure gageSmall hole Fig. 6.3 Measurement of stagnation pressure.6.3 Bernoulli Equation: Integration of Euler’s Equation Along a Streamline for Steady Flow 245as shown. (The stem of the total head tube is placed downstream from the mea- surement location to minimize disturbance of the local ﬂow.) Two probes often are combined, as in the pitot-static tube shown in Fig. 6.4 b. The inner tube is used to measure the stagnation pressure at point B, while the static pressure at Cis sensed using the small holes in the outer tube. In ﬂow ﬁelds where the static pressure variation in the streamwise direction is small, the pitot-static tube maybe used to infer the speed at point Bin the ﬂow by assuming p B5pCand using Eq. 6.12. (Note that when pB6¼pC, this procedure will give erroneous results.) Remember that the Bernoulli equation applies only for incompressible ﬂow (Mach num berM#0.3). The deﬁnition and calculation of the stagnation pressure for compressible ﬂow will be discussed in Section 12.3.FlowFlowTotal headtubeA pp 0B CStatic pressure holes p0p (b) Pitot-static tube (a) Total head tube used with wall static tap Fig. 6.4 Simultaneous measurement of stagnation and static pressures. Example 6.2 PITOT TUBE A pitot tube is inserted in an air ﬂow (at STP) to measure the ﬂow speed. The tube is inserted so that it points upstream into the ﬂow and the pressure sensed by the tube is the stagnation pressure. The static pressure is measuredat the same location in the ﬂow, using a wall pressure tap. If the pressure difference is 30 mm of mercury, determinethe ﬂow speed.

Applications ofEqs. 6.8 and 6.13 to typical ﬂow problems are illustrated in Examples 6.3 through 6.5. In some situations, the ﬂow appears unsteady from one reference frame, but steady from another, which translates with the ﬂow. Since the Bernoulli equation was derived by integrating Newton’s second law for a ﬂuid particle, it can be applied in any inertial reference frame (see the discussion of translating frames in Section 4.4).

Given: Aircraft in ﬂight at 150 km/hr at 1000 m altitude in standard air. Find: Stagnation pressure, p0A, at point Aand static pressure, pB, at point B. Solution: Flow is unsteady when observed from a ﬁxed frame, that is, by an observer on the ground. However, an observer on the wing sees the following steady ﬂow: Atz51000 m in standard air, the temperature is 281 K and the speed of sound is 336 m/s. Hence at point B, MB5VB/c50.178. This is less than 0.3, so the ﬂow may be treated as incompressible. Thus the Bernoulli equation can be applied along a streamline in the moving observer’s inertial reference frame.

However, in some situations you might be tempted to apply the Bernoulliequation where the restrictions are not satisﬁed. Some subtle cases that violate the restrictions are discussed brieﬂy in this section. Example 6.3 examined ﬂow in a nozzle. In a subsonic nozzle (a converging section) the pressure drops, accelerating a ﬂow. Because the pressure drops and the walls of the nozzle converge, there is no ﬂow separation from the walls and the boundarylayer remains thin. In addition, a nozzle is usually relatively short so frictional effectsare not signiﬁcant. All of this leads to the conclusion that the Bernoulli equation issuitable for use for subsonic nozzles. Sometimes we need to decelerate a ﬂow. This can be accomplished using a subsonic diffuser (a diverging section), or by using a sudden expansion (e.g., from a pipe into a reservoir). In these devices the ﬂow decelerates because of an adverse pressure gra-dient. As we discussed in Section 2.6, an adverse pressure gradient tends to lead torapid growth of the boundary layer and its separation. Hence, we should be careful inapplying the Bernoulli equation in such devices—at best, it will be an approximation.Because of area blockage caused by boundary-layer growth, pressure rise in actualdiffusers always is less than that predicted for inviscid one-dimensional ﬂow. The Bernoulli equation was a reasonable model for the siphon of Example 6.4 because the entrance was well rounded, the bends were gentle, and the overall lengthwas short. Flow separation, which can occur at inlets with sharp corners and in abruptbends, causes the ﬂow to depart from that predicted by a one-dimensional model and theBernoulli equation. Frictional effects would not be negligible if the tube were long. Example 6.5 presented an open-channel ﬂow analogous to that in a nozzle, for which the Bernoulli equation is a good ﬂow model. The hydraulic jump is an exampleof an open-channel ﬂow with adverse pressure gradient. Flow through a hydraulicjump is mixed violently, making it impossible to identify streamlines. Thus the Ber- noulli equation cannot be used to model ﬂow through a hydraulic jump. We will see a more detailed presentation of open channel ﬂows in Chapter 11. The Bernoulli equation cannot be applied through a machine such as a propeller, pump, turbine, or windmill.

CLASSIC VIDEO Flow Visualization .252 Chapter 6Incompressible Inviscid Flowtube (Section 4.4) or a streamline (Section 6.3) in the absence of moving surfaces such as blades or vanes. It is impossible to have locally steady ﬂow or to identify stream-lines during ﬂow through a machine. Hence, while the Bernoulli equation may be applied between points before a machine, or between points after a machine (assuming its restrictions are satisﬁed), it cannot be applied through the machine. (In effect, a machine will change the value of the Bernoulli constant.) Finally, compressibility must be considered for ﬂow of gases. Density changes caused by dynamic compression due to motion may be neglected for engineering purposes if the local Mach number remains below about M/C250.3, as noted in Examples 6.3 and 6.6. Temperature changes can cause signiﬁcant changes in density of a gas, even for low-speedﬂow. Thus the Bernoulli equation could not be applied to air ﬂow through a heating element (e.g., of a hand-held hair dryer) where temperature changes are signiﬁcant. 6.4 The Bernoulli Equation Interpreted as an Energy Equation The Bernoulli equation, Eq. 6.8, was obtained by integrating Euler’s equation along a streamline for steady, incompressible, frictionless ﬂow. Thus Eq. 6.8 was derived fromthe momentum equation for a ﬂuid particle. An equation identical in form to Eq. 6.8 (although requiring very different restrictions) may be obtained from the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. Our objective inthis section is to reduce the energy equation to the form of the Bernoulli equation given by Eq. 6.8. Having arrived at this form, we then compare the restrictions on the two equations to help us understand more clearly the restrictions on the use of Eq. 6.8. Consider steady ﬂow in the absence of shear forces. We choose a control volume bounded by streamlines along its periphery. Such a boundary, shown in Fig. 6.5 , often is called a stream tube .

The Bernoulli eq uation was derived from momentum considerations (Newton’s second law), and is valid for steady, incompressible, frictionless ﬂow along a streamline. Equation 6.15 wasobtained by applying the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics to a stream tube control volume,subject to restrictions 1 through 7 above. Thus the Bernoulli equation (Eq. 6.8) and the identical form of the energy equation (Eq. 6.15) were developed from entirely different models, coming from entirely different basic concepts, and involving different restrictions.254 Chapter 6Incompressible Inviscid FlowIt looks like we needed restriction (7) to ﬁnally transform the energy equation into the Bernoulli equation. In fact, we didn’t! It turns out that for an incompressible and fric- tionless ﬂow [restriction (6), and the fact we are looking only at ﬂows with no shear forces], restriction (7) is automatically satisﬁed, as we will demonstrate in Example 6.7. For the steady, frictionless, and incompressible ﬂow considered in this section, it is true that the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics reduces to the Bernoulli equation. Each term in Eq. 6.15 has dimensions of energy per unit mass (we sometimes refer to the three terms in the equation as the “pressure” energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy per unit mass of the ﬂuid). It is not surprising that Eq. 6.15 contains energy terms—after all,we used the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics in deriving it. How did we end up withthe same energy-like terms in the Bernoulli equation, which we derived from themomentum equation? The answer is because we integrated the momentum equation(which involves force terms) along a streamline (which involves distance), and by doingso ended up with work or energy terms (work being deﬁned as force times distance):The work of gravity and pressure forces leads to a kinetic energy change (which came from integrating momentum over distance). In this context, we can think of the Ber- noulli equation as a mechanical energy balance —the mechanical energy (“pressure” plus potential plus kinetic) will be constant. We must always bear in mind that for theBernoulli equation to be valid along a streamline requires an incompressible inviscidﬂow, in addition to steady ﬂow. It’s interesting that these two properties of the ﬂow—itscompressibility and friction—are what “link” thermodynamic and mechanical energies.If a ﬂuid is compressible, any ﬂow-induced pressure changes will compress or expandthe ﬂuid, thereby doing work and changing the particle thermal energy; and friction, as we know from everyday experience, always converts mechanical to thermal energy. Their absence, therefore, breaks the link between the mechanical and thermal energies,and they are independent—it’s as if they’re in parallel universes!Example 6.7 INTERNAL ENERGY AND HEAT TRANSFER IN FRICTIONLESS INCOMPRESSIBLE FLOW Consider frictionless, incompressible ﬂow with heat transfer. Show that u22u15δQ dm Given: Frictionless, incompressible ﬂow with heat transfer. Show: u22u15δQ dm. Solution:In general, internal energy can be expressed as u5u(T,v). For incompressible ﬂow, v5constant, and u5u(T). Thus the thermodynamic state of the ﬂuid is determined by the single thermodynamic property, T. For any process, the internal energy change, u 22u1, depends only on the temperatures at the end states. From the Gibbs equation, Tds5du1ρdv, valid for a pure substance undergoing any process, we obtain Tds5du for incompressible ﬂow, since dv50. Since the internal energy change, du, between speciﬁed end states, is inde- pendent of the process, we take a reversible process, for which Tds5d(δQ/dm)5du. Therefore, u22u15δQ dmß6.4 The Bernoulli Equation Interpreted as an Energy Equation 255In summary, when the conditions are satisﬁed for the Bernoulli equation to be valid, we can consider separately the mechanical energy and the internal thermal energy of a ﬂuid particle (this is illustrated in Example 6.8); when they are not satisﬁed, there will be an interaction between these energies, the Bernoulli equation becomes invalid, and we must use the full ﬁrst law of thermodynamics.

We can goone stepfurther here and get a very useful graphical approach if we also deﬁne this to be the energy grade line (EGL), EGL5p ρg1V2 2g1z ð6:16bÞ This can be measured using the pitot (total head) tube (shown in Fig. 6.3 ). Placing such a tube in a ﬂow measures the total pressure, p05p11 2ρV2, so this will cause the height of a column of the same ﬂuid to rise to a height h5p0=ρg5p=ρg1V2=2g.I f the vertical location of the pitot tube is z, measured from some datum (e.g., the ground), the height of column of ﬂuid measured from the datum will then be h1z5p=ρg1V2=2g1z5EGL5H. In summary, the height of the column, measured from the datum, attached to a pitot tube directly indicates the EGL. We can also deﬁne the hydraul ic grade line (HGL), HGL5p ρg1z ð6:16cÞ This can be measured using the static pressure tap (shown in Fig. 6.2 a). Placing such a tube in a ﬂow measures the static pressure, p, so this will cause the height of a column of the same ﬂuid to rise to a height h5p=ρg. If the vertical location of the tap is also atz, measured from some datum, the height of column of ﬂuid measured from the datum will then be h1z5p=ρg1z5HGL . The height of the column attached to a static pressure tap thus directly indicates the HGL. From Eqs. 6.16b and 6.16c we obtain EGL2HGL5V2 2gð6:16dÞ which shows that the difference between the EGL and HGL is always the dynamic pre ssure term. To see a graphical interpretation of the EGL and HGL, refer to the example shown in Fig. 6.6 , which shows frictionless ﬂow from a reservoir, through a pipe reducer. At all locations the EGL is the same because there is no loss of mechanical energy. Stati on1is at the reservoir, and here the EGL and HGL coincide with the free surface: in Eqs. 6.16b and 6.16c p50 (gage), V50, and z5z1,s oEGL 15HGL 15H5z1; all of the mechanical energy is potential. (If we were to place a pitot tube in the ﬂuid at station 1, the ﬂuid would of course just rise to the free surface level.) At station 2we have a pitot (total head) tube and a static head tap. The pitot tube’s column indicates the correct value of the EGL ( EGL 15EGL 25H), but something changed between the two stations: The ﬂuid now has signiﬁcant kinetic energy and has lost some potential energy (can you determine from the ﬁgure whathappened to the pressure?). From Eq. 6.16d, we can see that the HGL is lower thanthe EGL by V 2 2=2g; the HGL at station 2shows this. From station 2to station 3there is a reduction in diameter, so continuity requires thatV3.V2; hence the gap between the EGL and HGL increases further, as shown.258 Chapter 6Incompressible Inviscid FlowStation 4is at the exit (to the atmosphere). Here the pressure is zero (gage), so the EGL consists entirely of kinetic and potential energy terms, and HGL 45HGL 3.W e can summarize two important ideas when sketching EGL and HGL curves: 1.The EGL is constant for incompressible, inviscid ﬂow (in the absence of work devic es). We will see in Chapter 8 that work devices may increase or decrease the EGL, and friction will always lead to a fall in the EGL. 2.The HGL is always lower than the EGL by distance V2=2g. Note that the value of velocity Vdepends on the overall system (e.g., reservoir height, pipe diameter, etc.), but changes in velocity only occur when the diameter changes. 6.6* Unsteady Bernoulli Equation: Integration of Euler's Equation Along a Streamline (on the Web) 6.7* Irrotational Flow We have already discussed irrotational ﬂows in Section 5.3.

In general, the value of the constant will vary from streamline to streamline. If, in addition to being inviscid, steady, and incompressible, the ﬂow ﬁeld is also irrotational (i.e., the particles had no initial rotation), so that r3~V50 (Eq. 6.22), we can show that Bernoulli’s equation can be applied between any and all points inthe ﬂow. Then the value of the constant in Eq. 6.8 is the same for all streamlines.

Velocity Potential We were introduced in Section 5.2 to the notion of the stream function ψfor a two- dimensional incompressible ﬂow. For irrotational ﬂow we can introduce a companion function, the potential function φ, deﬁned by ~V52rφ ð6:27Þ Why this deﬁnition? Because it guarantees that an ycontinuous scalar function φ(x,y, z,t)automatically satisﬁes the irrotationality condition (Eq. 6.22) because of a fun- damental identity:3 r3~V52r3rφ52curlð grad φÞ/C170 ð6:28Þ The minus sign (used in most textbooks) is inserted simply so that φdecreas es in the ﬂow direction (analogous to the temperature decreasing in the direction of heat ﬂow in heat conduction). Thus, u52@φ @x;v52@φ @y;and w52@φ @zð6:29Þ (You can check that the irrotationality condition, Eq. 6.22, is satisﬁed identically.)

Irrotationality may be a valid assumption for those regions of a ﬂow in which viscous forces are negligible. (For example, such a region exists outside the boundarylayer in the ﬂow over a wing surface, and can be analyzed to ﬁnd the lift produced bythe wing.) The theory for irrotational ﬂow is developed in terms of an imaginary idealﬂuid whose viscosity is identically zero. Since, in an irrotational ﬂow, the velocity ﬁeldmay be deﬁned by the potential function φ, the theory is often referred to as potential ﬂow theory.

CLASSIC VIDEO Vorticity .6.7 Irrotational Flow 261All real ﬂuids possess viscosity, but there are many situations in which the assumption of inviscid ﬂow considerably simpliﬁes the analysis and, at the same time, gives meaningful results. Because of its relative simplicity and mathematical beauty, potential ﬂow has been studied extensively.4 Stream Function and Velocity Potential for Two-Dimensional, Irrotational, Incompressible Flow: Laplace’s Equation For a two-dimensional, incompressible, irrotational ﬂow we have expressions for the velocity components, uandv, in terms of both the stream function ψ, and the velocity potential φ, u5@ψ @yv52@ψ @xð5:4Þ u52@φ @xv52@φ @yð6:29Þ Substituting for uan dvfrom Eq. 5.4 into the irrotationality condition, @v @x2@u @y50 ð6:23Þ we obtain @2ψ @x21@2ψ @y25r2ψ50 ð6:31Þ Substituting for uan dvfrom Eq. 6.29 into the continuity equation, @u @x1@v @y50 ð5:3Þ we obtain @2φ @x21@2φ @y25r2φ50 ð6:32Þ Equations 6.31 and 6.32 are forms of Laplace’s equation—an equation that arises inmany areas of the physical sciences and engineering. Any function ψorφthat satisﬁes Laplace’s equation represents a possible two-dimensional, incompressible, irrota-tional ﬂow ﬁeld. Table 6.1 summarizes the results of our discussion of the stream function and veloc ity potential for two dimensional ﬂows.

This property of potential lines and streamlines is useful in graphical analyses of ﬂow ﬁelds.Table 6.1 Deﬁnitions of ψandφ, and Conditions Necessary for Satisfying Laplace’s Equation Deﬁnition Always satisﬁes ...Satisﬁes Laplace equation ... @2ðÞ @x21@2ðÞ @y25r2ðÞ50 Stream function ψ u5@ψ @yv52@ψ @x...incompressibility: @u @x1@v @y5@2ψ @x@y2@2ψ @y@x/C170...only if irrotational: @v @x2@u @y52@2ψ @x@x2@2ψ @y@y50 Velocity potential φ u52@φ @xv52@φ @y...irrotationality: @v @x2@u @y52@2φ @x@y2@2φ @y@x/C170...only if incompressible: @u @x1@v @y52@2φ @x@x2@2φ @y@y50 Example 6.10 VELOCITY POTENTIAL Consider the ﬂow ﬁeld given by ψ5ax22ay2, where a53s21.

In Table 6.2 we have shown the ψandφfunct ions for a uniform ﬂow in the positive xdirection. For a uniform ﬂow of constant magnitude V, inclined at angle αto the xaxis, ψ5ðVcosαÞy2ðVsinαÞx φ52ðVsinαÞy2ðVcosαÞx A simple source is a ﬂow pattern in the xyplane in which ﬂow is radially outward from the zaxis and symmetrical in all directions. The strength, q, of the source is the volume ﬂow rate per unit depth. At any radius, r, from a source, the tangential velocity, Vθ, is zero; the radial velocity, Vr, is the volume ﬂow rate per unit depth, q, divided by the ﬂow area per unit depth, 2 πr. Thus Vr5q/2πrfor a source. Knowing Vr andVθ, obtaining ψandφfrom Eqs. 5.8 and 6.33, respectively, is straightforward. In a simple sink, ﬂow is radially inward; a sink is a negative source. The ψandφ functions for a sink shown in Table 6.2 are the negatives of the corresponding func- tions for a source ﬂow. The origin of either a sink or a source is a singular point, since the radial velocity ap proaches inﬁnity as the radius approaches zero. Thus, while an actual ﬂow may resemble a source or a sink for some values of r, sources and sinks have no exact physical counterparts. The primary value of the concept of sources and sinks is that, when combined with other elementary ﬂows, they produce ﬂow patterns that ade-quately represent realistic ﬂows. A ﬂow pattern in which the streamlines are concentric circles is a vortex; in a free (irrotational) vortex , ﬂuid particles do not rotate as they translate in circular paths around the vortex center. There are a number of ways of obtaining the velocity ﬁeld,for example, by combining the equation of motion (Euler’s equation) and theBernoulli equation to eliminate the pressure. Here, though, for circular streamlines,we have V r50 and Vθ5f(θ) only. We also have previously introduced the condition of irrotationality in cylindrical coordinates, 1 r@rVθ @r21 r@Vr @θ50 ð6:24Þ Hence, using the known forms of VrandVθ, we obtainTable 6.2 Elementary Plane Flows ( Continued ) y xr θDoublet (center at origin) Vr52Λ r2cosθψ52Λsinθ r Vθ52Λ r2sinθφ52Λcosθ r Origin is singular point Λis strength of the doublet Γ5around any closed curveψ= –c2 ψ= –c3 ψ= 0 ψ= c3 ψ= c2ψ= –c1 ψ= c1φ= –k1 φ= k1 φ= k2 φ= –k2 xy266 Chapter 6Incompressible Inviscid Flow1 rdðrVθÞ dr50 Integrating this equation gives Vθr5constant The strength, K, of the vortex is deﬁned as K52πrVθ; the dimensions of KareL2/t (volume ﬂow rate per unit depth). Once again, knowing VrandVθ, obtaining ψandφ from Eqs. 5.8 and 6.33, respectively, is straightforward. The irrotational vortex is a reasonable approximation to the ﬂow ﬁeld in a tornado (except in the region of theorigin; the origin is a singular point). The ﬁnal “elementary” ﬂow listed in Table 6.2 is the doublet of strength Λ. This ﬂow is produced mathematically by allowing a source and a sink of numerically equal strengths to merge. In the limit, as the distance, δs, between them approaches zero, their strengths increase so the product qδs/2πtends to a ﬁnite value, Λ, which is termed the strength of the doublet. Superposition of Elementary Plane Flows We saw earlier that both φandψsatisfy Laplace’s equation for ﬂow that is both incompressible and irrotational. Since Laplace’s equation is a linear, homogeneous partial differential equation, solutions may be superposed (added together) to developmore complex and interesting patterns of ﬂow. Thus if ψ 1andψ2satisfy Laplace’s equation, then so does ψ35ψ11ψ2. The elementary plane ﬂows are the building blocks in this superposition process. There is one note of caution: While Laplace’sequation for the stream function, and the stream function-velocity ﬁeld equations (Eq.5.3) are linear, the Bernoulli equation is not; hence, in the superposition process wewill have ψ 35ψ11ψ2,u35u11u2, and v35v11v2, but p36¼p11p2! We must use the Bernoulli equation, which is nonlinear in V, to ﬁnd p3. We can add together elementary ﬂows to try and generate recognizable ﬂow pat- terns. The simplest superposition approach is called the direct method, in which we try different combinations of elementary ﬂows and see what kinds of ﬂow patterns areproduced. This sounds like a random process, but with a little experience it becomes aquite logical process. For example, look at some of the classic examples listed inTable 6.3 . The source and uniform ﬂow combination makes sense—we would intui- tively expect a source to partially push its way upstream, and to divert the ﬂow around it. The source, sink, and uniform ﬂow (generating what is called a Rankine body) isalso not surprising—the entire ﬂow out of the source makes its way into the sink,leading to a closed streamline. Any streamline can be interpreted as a solid surface because there is no ﬂow across it; we can therefore pretend that this closed streamline represents a solid. We could easily generalize this source-sink approach to anynumber of sources and sinks distributed along the xaxis, and as long as the sum of the source and sink strengths added up to zero, we would generate a closed streamlinebody shape. The doublet-uniform ﬂow (with or without a vortex) generates a very interesting result: ﬂow over a cylinder (with or without circulation)! We ﬁrst saw the ﬂow without circulation in Fig. 2.12 a. The ﬂow with a clockwise vortex produces a top- to-bottom asymmetry. This is because in the region above the cylinder the velocitiesdue to the uniform ﬂow and vortex are in the same overall direction and lead to a highvelocity; below the cylinder they are in opposite directions and therefore lead to a lowvelocity. As we have learned, whenever velocities are high, streamlines will be closetogether, and vice versa—explaining the pattern shown. More importantly, from theBernoulli equation we know that whenever the velocity is high the pressure will be low, and vice versa—hence, we can anticipate that the cylinder with circulation will experience a net upward force (lift) due to pressure. This approach, of looking at6.7 Irrotational Flow 267Table 6.3 Superposition of Elementary Plane Flows Source and Uniform Flow (ﬂow past a half-body) y xrPV1 V2V θψ5ψso1ψuf5ψ11ψ25q 2πθ1Uy ψ5q 2πθ1Ursinθ φ5φso1φuf5φ11φ252q 2πlnr2Ux φ52q 2πlnr2UrcosθP Source and Sink (equal strength, separation distance on xaxis52a) y xV2V1 r2r1 r VP θ1θ2 (a,0) (–a,0)ψ5ψso1ψsi5ψ11ψ25q 2πθ12q 2πθ2 ψ5q 2πðθ12θ2Þ φ5φso1φsi5φ11φ252q 2πlnr11q 2πlnr2 φ5q 2πlnr2 r1P Source, Sink, and Uniform Flow (ﬂow past a Rankine body) y xV2V3V1 r2r1 rVP θ θ1θ2ψ5ψso1ψsi1ψuf5ψ11ψ21ψ3 5q 2πθ12q 2πθ21Uy ψ5q 2πðθ12θ2Þ1Ursinθ φ5φso1φsi1φuf5φ11φ21φ3 52q 2πlnr11q 2πlnr22Ux φ5q 2πlnr2 r12UrcosθP Vortex (clockwise) and Uniform Flow y xV1V2 P rV θψ5ψv1ψuf5ψ11ψ25K 2πlnr1Uy ψ5K 2πlnr1Ursinθ φ5φv1φuf5φ11φ25K 2πθ2Ux φ5K 2πθ2UrcosθP268 Chapter 6Incompressible Inviscid FlowTable 6.3 Superposition of Elementary Plane Flows ( Continued ) Doublet and Uniform Flow (ﬂow past a cylinder) y xV1V2 P r V θψ5ψd1ψuf5ψ11ψ252Λsinθ r1Uy 52Λsinθ r1Ursinθ ψ5Ur2Λ Ur0 @1Asinθ ψ5Ur 12 a2 r20@1Asinθa5ﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ Λ Us φ5φd1φuf5φ11φ252Λcosθ r2Ux 52Λcosθ r2Urcosθ φ52Ur1Λ Ur/C18/C19 cosθ52Ur11a2 r2/C18/C19 cosθP Doublet, Vortex (clockwise), and Uniform Flow (ﬂow past a cylinder with circulation) y xV1V2V3 P rV θψ5ψd1ψv1ψuf5ψ11ψ21ψ3 52Λsinθ r1K 2πlnr1Uy ψ52Λsinθ r1K 2πlnr1Ursinθ ψ5Ur 12a2 r20@1Asinθ1 K 2πlnr φ5φd1φv1φuf5φ11φ21φ3 52Λcosθ r1K 2πθ2UxP a5ﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ Λ Ur ;K,4πaU φ52Λcosθ r1K 2πθ2Urcosθ φ52Ur 11a2 r20@1Acosθ1 K 2πθ Source and Vortex (spiral vortex) y xrV PV1 V2 θψ5ψso1ψv5ψ11ψ25q 2πθ2K 2πlnr φ5φso1φv5φ11φ252q 2πlnr2K 2πθP (Continued )6.7 Irrotational Flow 269streamline patterns to see where we have regions of high or low velocity and hence low or high pressure, is very useful. We will examine these last two ﬂows in Examples6.11 and 6.12. The last example in Table 6.3, the vortex pair, hints at a way to createﬂows that simulate the presence of a wall or walls: for the yaxis to be a stream- line (and thus a wall), simply make sure that any objects (e.g., a source, a vortex) in the positive xquadrants have mirror-image objects in the negative xquadrants; the y axis will thus be a line of symmetry. For a ﬂow pattern in a 90 /C14corner, we need to place objects so that we have symmetry with respect to both the xandyaxes. For ﬂow in a corner whose angle is a fraction of 90/C14(e.g., 30/C14), we need to place objects in a radially symmetric fashion. Because Laplace’s equation appears in many engineering and physics applications, it has been extensively studied. We saw in Example 5.12 that Laplace’s equation is sometimes amenable to a fairly simple numerical solution using a spreadsheet. Foranalytic solutions, one approach is to use conformal mapping with complex notation. It turns out that any continuous complex function f(z) (where z5x1iy, and i5ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 21p ) is a solution of Laplace’s equation, and can therefore represent both φ andψ. With this approach many elegant mathematical results have been derived [7/C010]. We mention only two: the circle theorem, which enables any given ﬂow [e.g., from a source at some point ( a,b)] to be easily transformed to allow for the presence of a cylinder at the origin; and the Schwarz-Christoffel theorem, which enables a givenﬂow to be transformed to allow for the presence of virtually unlimited stepwise linear boundaries (e.g., the presence on the xaxis of the silhouette of a building).Table 6.3 Superposition of Elementary Plane Flows ( Continued ) Sink and Vortex y xrV P V1V2 θψ5ψsi1ψv5ψ11ψ252q 2πθ2K 2πlnr φ5φsi1φv5φ11φ25q 2πlnr2K 2πθP Vortex Pair (equal strength, opposite rotation, separation distance on xaxis52a) y xr2r1 1V1V2 P V θ 2θ (a,0) (–a,0)ψ5ψv11ψv25ψ11ψ252K 2πlnr11K 2πlnr2 ψ5K 2πlnr2 r1 φ5φv11φv25φ11φ252K 2πθ11K 2πθ2 φ5K 2πðθ22θ1ÞP270 Chapter 6Incompressible Inviscid FlowMuch of this analytical work was done centuries ago, when it was called “hydro- dynamics” instead of potential theory. A list of famous contributors includes Ber- noulli, Lagrange, d’Alembert, Cauchy, Rankine, and Euler [11]. As we discussed in Section 2.6, the theory immediately ran into difﬁculties: In an ideal ﬂuid ﬂow no body experiences drag—the d’Alembert paradox of 1752—a result completely counterto experience. Prandtl, in 1904, resolved this discrepancy by describing how real ﬂowsmay be essentially inviscid almost everywhere, but there is always a “boundary layer”adjacent to the body. In this layer signiﬁcant viscous effects occur, and the no-slipcondition is satisﬁed (in potential ﬂow theory the no-slip condition is not satisﬁed).Development of this concept, and the Wright brothers’ historic ﬁrst human ﬂight, ledto rapid developments in aeronautics starting in the 1900s. We will study boundary layers in detail in Chapter 9, where we will see that their existence leads to drag on bodies, and also affects the lift of bodies. An alternative superposition approach is the inverse method in which distributions of objects such as sources, sinks, and vortices are used to model a body [12]. It is calledinverse because the body shape is deduced based on a desired pressure distribution.Both the direct and inverse methods, including three-dimensional space, are todaymostly analyzed using computer applications such as Fluent [13] and STAR-CD [14].

Obtain the stream function and velocitypotential for this ﬂow pattern, using a clockwise free vortex. Find the velocity ﬁeld, locate the stagnation points and the cylinder surface, and obtain the surface pressure distribution. Integrate the pressure distribution to obtain the drag and lift forces on the circular cylinder. Relate the lift force on the cylinder to the circulation of the free vortex.

A single stagnation point is located at θ52π/2 when K54πUa. Even with the free vortex present, the ﬂow ﬁeld is irrotational, so the Bernoulli equation may be applied between any two points.

Wehave also seen how for a steady, incompressible ﬂow through a stream tube the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics reduces to the Bernoulli equation if certain restrictions apply.276 Chapter 6Incompressible Inviscid FlowüDeﬁned the static, dynamic, and stagnation (or total) pressures. üDeﬁned the energy and hydraulic grade lines. ü*Derived an unsteady ﬂow Bernoulli equation, and discussed its restrictions. ü*Observed that for an irrotational ﬂow that is steady and incompressible, the Bernoulli equation applies between anytwo points in the ﬂow. ü*Deﬁned the velocity potential φand discussed its restrictions. We have also explored in detail two-dimensional, incompressible, and irrotational ﬂows, and learned that for these ﬂows: the stream function ψand the velocity potential φsatisfy Laplace’s equation; ψandφcan be derived from the velocity components, and vice versa, and the iso-lines of the stream function ψand the velocity potential φare orthogonal. We explored for such ﬂows how to combine potential ﬂows to generate various ﬂow patterns, and how to determine the pressure distribution and lift and drag on, for example, a cylindrical shape.

(Credit: Boeing/ Bob Ferguson) Boeing Phantom Works has partnered with NASA and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory to study anadvanced-concept, fuel-efﬁcient, blended wing-body. Itis called a blended wing-body (BWB) because it looksmore like a modiﬁed triangular-shaped wing than tra-ditional aircraft, which essentially consist of a tube and wing with a tail. The concept of a BWB actually goes back to the 1940s, but developments in compositematerials and ﬂy-by-wire controls are making it morefeasible. Researchers have tested a 6.3-m wingspan(8.5 percent scale) prototype of the X-48B, a BWBaircraft that could have military and commercial appli-cations. The next step is for NASA to ﬂight-test a scale-model variant called X-48C. The X-48C will be used to examine how engines mounted to the rear and above the body help to shield the ground from engine noiseon takeoff and approach. It also features tail ﬁns foradditional noise shielding and for ﬂight control. The big difference between BWB aircraft and the tra- ditional tube-and-wing aircraft, apart from the fact thatthe tube is absorbed into the wing shape, is that it doesnot have a tail. Traditional aircraft need a tail for stability and control; the BWB uses a number of different multiple- control surfaces and possibly tail ﬁns to control thevehicle. There will be a number of advantages to the BWBif it proves feasible.

Studies have also shown that BWB designs can ﬁt into the 80-m(260-ft) envelope that is the current standard for airplanemaneuver at airports. A BWB could carry up to 1000people, making such a future U.S. product a challenge toAirbus’s A380 and future stretched versions. Apart from possible fuel savings of up to 30 percent due to improved streamlining, the interior of acommercial BWB airplane would be radically differentfrom that of current airplanes. Passengers would enter aroom like a movie theater rather than a cramped half-cylinder, there would be no windows (video screenswould be connected to external cameras instead),and passengers would be seated in the large movietheater /C0like room (because seating is not only in the central core but also well out into the blended wings).Problems 279of velocity.

Plenty of power is avail-able. Although ocean and river currents move slowlycompared to typical wind speeds, they carry a great deal of energy because water is about 1000 times as dense as air, and the energy ﬂux in a current is directlyproportional to density. Hence water moving at 10 mphexerts about the same amount of force as a 100-mphwind. Ocean and river currents thus contain an enor-mous amount of energy that can be captured and converted to a usable form. For example, near the surface of the Florida Straits Current, the relativelyconstant extractable energy density is about 1 kW/m 2 of ﬂow area. It has been estimated that capturing just1/1000th of the available energy from the Gulf Streamcould supply Florida with 35 percent of its electricalneeds. 290Ocean current energy is at an early stage of devel- opment, and only a small number of prototypes and demonstration units have so far been tested. A teamof young engineers at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland recently did a survey of current develop- ments. They found that perhaps the most obviousapproach is to use submerged turbines. The ﬁrst ﬁg-ure shows a horizontal-axis turbine (which is similar toa wind turbine) and a vertical-axis turbine. In eachcase, columns, cables, or anchors are required to keepthe turbines stationary relative to the currents withwhich they interact. For example, they may be teth- ered with cables, in such a way that the current interacts with the turbine to maintain its location andstability; this is analogous to underwater kite ﬂying inwhich the turbine plays the role of kite and the ocean-bottom anchor, the role of kite ﬂyer. Turbines caninclude venturi-shaped shrouds around the blades toincrease the ﬂow speed and power output from theturbine. In regions with powerful currents over a large area, turbines could be assembled in clusters, similar to wind turbine farms. Space would be neededbetween the water turbines to eliminate wake-interaction effects and to allow access by maintenancevessels. The engineers at Strathclyde also discuss thethird device shown in the ﬁgure, an oscillating foildesign, in which a hydrofoil’s angle of attack would berepeatedly adjusted to generate a lift force that is upward, then downward. The mechanism and controls would use this oscillating force to generate power. Theadvantage of this design is that there are no rotatingparts that could become fouled, but the disadvantageis that the control systems involved would be quitecomplex. For ocean current energy to be commercially suc- cessful, a number of technical challenges need to be addressed, including cavitation problems, prevention of marine growth buildup on turbine blades, and cor-rosion resistance. Environmental concerns include theprotection of wildlife (ﬁsh and marine mammals) fromturning turbine blades. As the research in these types of turbines and foils continues, engineers are also looking at alternative devices. A good example is the work of Professor Michael Bernitsas, of the Department of Naval Archi-tecture and Marine Engineering at the University ofMichigan. He has developed a novel device, called theVivace Converter , which uses the well-known phe- nomenon of vortex-induced vibrations to extract powerfrom a ﬂowing current. We are all familiar with vortex-induced vibrations, in which an object in a ﬂow is made to vibrate due to vortices shedding ﬁrst from one side and then the other side of the object’s rear.For example, cables or wires often vibrate in the wind,sometimes sufﬁciently to make noise ( Aeolian tones ); many factory chimneys and car antennas have a spiralsurface built into them speciﬁcally to suppress thisvibration. Another famous example is the collapse ofthe Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Washington State in 1940, which many engineers believe was due to vortex-shedding of cross winds (a quite scary, but The Vivace Converter (Courtesy Professor Michael Bernitsas) A horizontal- and a vertical-axis turbine, and an oscillating foil device (Courtesy the University of Strathclyde)Dimensional Analysis and Similitude 291In previous chapters we have mentioned several instances in which we claim a simpliﬁed ﬂow exists. For example, we have stated that a ﬂow with typical speed Vwill be essentially incompressible if the Mach number, M/C17V/c(where cis the speed of sound), is less than about 0.3 and that we can neglect viscous effects in most of a ﬂow if the Reynolds number, Re=ρVL/μ(Lis a typical or “characteristic” size scale of the ﬂow), is “large.” We will also make extensive use of the Reynolds number basedon pipe diameter, D(Re=ρVD/μ), to predict with a high degree of accuracy whether the pipe ﬂow is laminar or turbulent. It turns out that there are many such interestingdimensionless groupings in engineering science—for example, in heat transfer, thevalue of the Biot number, Bi5hL/k, of a hot body, size Land conductivity k, indi- cates whether that body will tend to cool on the outside surface ﬁrst or will basicallycool uniformly when it’s plunged into a cool ﬂuid with convection coefﬁcient h. (Can you ﬁgure out what a high Binumber predicts?) How do we obtain these groupings, and why do their values have such powerful predictive power? The answers to these questions will be provided in this chapter when we introduce the method of dimensional analysis. This is a technique for gaining insight into ﬂuidﬂows (in fact, into many engineering and scientiﬁc phenomena) before we do eitherextensive theoretical analysis or experimentation; it also enables us to extract trendsfrom data that would otherwise remain disorganized and incoherent. We will also discuss modeling. For example, how do we correctly perform tests on the drag on a 3/8-scale model of an automobile in a wind tunnel to predict what the drag would be on the full-size automobile at the same speed? Must we use the same speed for model and full-size automobile? How do we scale up the measured model drag to ﬁnd the automobile drag? 7.1Nondimensionalizing the Basic Differential Equations Before describing dimensional analysis let us see what we can learn from our previous analytical descriptions of ﬂuid ﬂow. Consider, for example, a steady incompressiblefascinating, video of this can easily be found on theInternet). Professor Bernitas has made a source ofenergy from a phenomenon that is usually a nuisanceor a danger! The ﬁgure shows a conceptualization of his device, which consists of an assemblage of horizontal sub-merged cylinders. As the current ﬂows across these, vortex shedding occurs, generating an oscillating up- and-down force on each cylinder. Instead of thecylinders being rigidly mounted, they are attached to ahydraulic system designed in such a way that, as thecylinders are forced up and down, they generatepower. Whereas existing turbine systems need a cur-rent of about 5 knots to operate efﬁciently, the Vivacecan generate energy using currents that are as slow as 1 knot (most of the earth’s currents are slower than 3 knots). The device also does not obstruct views oraccess on the water’s surface because it can beinstalled on the river or ocean ﬂoor. It’s probable thatthis new technology is gentler on aquatic life becauseit is slow moving and mimics the natural vortex pat-terns created by the movement of swimming ﬁsh. Aninstallation of 1 31.5 km (less than 1/2 mi 2)i na current of 3 knots could generate enough power for 100,000 homes. A prototype, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Ofﬁce Naval Research,is currently operating in the Marine HydrodynamicsLaboratory at the University of Michigan. The phe-nomenon of vortex shedding is discussed in Chapter 9;the vortex ﬂow meter, which exploits the phenomenonto measure ﬂow rate, is discussed in Chapter 8. Wewill discuss airfoil design in Chapter 9 and concepts behind the operation of turbines and propellers in Chapter 10.292 Chapter 7Dimensional Analysis and Similitudetwo-dimensional ﬂow of a Newtonian ﬂuid with constant viscosity (already quite a list of assumptions!).

Equation 7.1 has dimensions of 1/time, and Eqs. 7.2 and 7.3 have dimensions of force/ volume. Let us see what happens when we convert them into dimensionless equations. (Even if you did not study Section 5.4 you will be able to understand the followingmaterial.) To nondimensionalize these equations, divide all lengths by a reference length, L, and all velocities by a reference speed, V N, which usually is taken as the freestream velocity. Make the pressure nondimensional by dividing by ρV2 N(twice the freestream dynamic pressure). Denoting nondimensional quantities with asterisks, we obtain x*5x L,y*5y L,u*5u VN,v*5v VN, and p*5p ρV2 Nð7:4Þ so that x5x*L,y5y*L,u5u*VN, and so on.

As such, we can think about their solution (with appropriate boundary conditions) as an exercise in applied mathematics. Equation 7.9 contains adimensionless coefﬁcient μ/ρV NL(which we recognize as the inverse of the Reynolds number) in front of the second-order (viscous) terms; Eq. 7.10 contains this andanother dimensionless coefﬁcient, gL/V 2 N(which we will discuss shortly) for the gravity force term. We recall from the theory of differential equations thatthe mathematical form of the solution of such equations is very sensitive to the valuesof the coefﬁcients in the equations (e.g., certain second-order partial differentialequations can be elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic depending on coefﬁcient values). These equations tell us that the solution, and hence the actual ﬂow pattern they describe, depends on the values of the two coefﬁcients. For example, if μ/ρV NLis very small (i.e., we have a high Reynolds number), the second-order differentials,representing viscous forces, can be neglected, at least in most of the ﬂow, and we endup with a form of Euler’s equations (Eqs. 6.2). We say “in most of the ﬂow” becausewe have already learned that in reality for this case we will have a boundary layer inwhich there issigniﬁcant effect of viscosity; in addition, from a mathematical point of view, it is always dangerous to neglect higher-order derivatives, even if their coefﬁ-cients are small, because reduction to a lower-order equation means we lose aboundary condition (speciﬁcally the no-slip condition). We can predict that if μ/ρV NL is large or small, then viscous forces will be signiﬁcant or not, respectively; if gLV2 Nis large or small, we can predict that gravity forces will be signiﬁcant or not, respectively.We can thus gain insight even before attempting a solution to the differential equa-tions. Note that for completeness, we would have to apply the same non-dimensionalizing approach to the boundary conditions of the problem, which oftenintroduce further dimensionless coefﬁcients. Writing nondimensional forms of the governing equations, then, can yield insight into the underlying physical phenomena, and indicate which forces are dominant. If we had two geometrically similar but different scale ﬂows satisfying Eqs. 7.8, 7.9, and 7.10 (for example, a model and a prototype), the equations would only yield the samemathematical results if the two ﬂows had the same values for the two coefﬁcients (i.e.,had the same relative importance of gravity, viscous, and inertia forces). This non-dimensional form of the equations is also the starting point in numerical methods,which is very often the only way of obtaining their solution. Additional derivationsand examples of establishing similitude from the governing equations of a problemare presented in Kline [1] and Hansen [2]. We will now see how the method of dimensional analysis can be used instead of the above procedure to ﬁnd appropriate dimensionless groupings of physical parameters.As we have mentioned, using dimensionless groupings is very useful for experimentalmeasurements, and we will see in the next two sections that we can obtain them evenwhen we do not have the governing equations such as Eqs. 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 to work from. 7.2 Nature of Dimensional Analysis Most phenomena in ﬂuid mechanics depend in a complex way on geometric and ﬂowparameters. For example, consider the drag force on a stationary smooth sphereimmersed in a uniform stream. What experiments must be conducted to determine the294 Chapter 7Dimensional Analysis and Similitudedrag force on the sphere? To answer this question, we must specify what we believe are the parameters that are important in determining the drag force. Clearly, we wouldexpect the drag force to depend on the size of the sphere (characterized by the diameter, D), the ﬂuid speed, V, and the ﬂuid viscosity, μ. In addition, the density of the ﬂuid, ρ, also might be important. Representing the drag force by F, we can write the symbolic equation F5fðD,V,ρ,μÞ Although we may have neglected parameters on which the drag force depends, such as surface roughness (or may have included parameters on which it does not depend), we have set up the problem of determining the drag force for a stationary sphere in terms of quantities that are both controllable and measurable in the laboratory. We could set up an experimental procedure for ﬁnding the dependence of FonV, D,ρ, and μ. To see how the drag, F, is affected by ﬂuid speed, V, we could place a sphere in a wind tunnel and measure Ffor a range of Vvalues. We could then run more tests in which we explore the effect on Fof sphere diameter, D, by using dif- ferent diameter spheres. We are already generating a lot of data: If we ran the windtunnel at, say, 10 different speeds, for 10 different sphere sizes, we’d have 100 data points. We could present these results on one graph (e.g., we could plot 10 curves of F vs.V, one for each sphere size), but acquiring the data would already be time con- suming: If we assume each run takes 1 2hour, we have already accumulated 50 hours of work! We still wouldn’t be ﬁnished—we would have to book time using, say, a water tank, where we could repeat all these runs for a different value of ρand of μ.I n principle, we would next have to search out a way to use other ﬂuids to be able to doexperiments for a range of ρandμvalues (say, 10 of each). At the end of the day (actually, at the end of about 2 1 2years of 40-hour weeks!) we would have performed about 104tests. Then we would have to try and make sense of the data: How do we plot, say, curves of Fvs.V, with D,ρ, and μall being parameters? This is a daunting task, even for such a seemingly simple phenomenon as the drag on a sphere! Fortunately we do not have to do all this work. As we will see in Example 7.1, using dimensional analysis, all the data for drag on a smooth sphere can be plotted as a single relationship between two nondimensional parameters in the form F ρV2D25fρVD μ/C18/C19 The form of the function fstill must be determined experimentally, but the point is that all spheres, in all ﬂuids, for most velocities will fall on the same curve. Rather than needing to conduct 104experiments, we could establish the nature of the function as accurately with only about 10 tests. The time saved in performing only 10 rather than 104tests is obvious. Even more important is the greater experimental con- venience. No longer must we ﬁnd ﬂuids with 10 different values of density and vis-cosity. Nor must we make 10 spheres of different diameters. Instead, only theparameter ρVD/μmust be varied. This can be accomplished simply by using one sphere (e.g., 1 in. diameter), in oneﬂuid (e.g., air), and only changing the speed, for example. Figure 7.1 shows some classic data for ﬂow over a sphere (the factors 1 2andπ/4 have been added to the denominator of the parameter on the left to make it take the form of a commonly used nondimensional group, the drag coefﬁcient, CD, that we will discuss in detail in Chapter 9). If we performed the experiments as outlined above, our resultswould fall on the same curve, within experimental error. The data points representresults obtained by various workers for several different ﬂuids and spheres. Note thatwe end up with a curve that can be used to obtain the drag force on a very wide range ofsphere/ﬂuid combinations. For example, it could be used to obtain the drag on a hot-air balloon due to a crosswind, or on a red blood cell (assuming it could be modeled as a VIDEO Flow Around a Sphere 1. VIDEO Flow Around a Sphere 2. 7.2 Nature of Dimensional Analysis 295sphere) as it moves through the aorta—in either case, given the ﬂuid ( ρandμ), the ﬂow speed V, and the sphere diameter D, we could compute a value for ρVD/μ, then read the corresponding value for CD, and ﬁnally compute the drag force F. In Section 7.3 we introduce the Buckingham Pi theorem, a formalized procedure for deducing the dimensionless groups appropriate for a given ﬂuid mechanics or other engineering problem. This section, and Section 7.4, may seem a bit difﬁcult to follow; we suggest you read them once, then study Examples 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 to seehow practical and useful the method in fact is, before returning to the two sections fora reread. The Buckingham Pi theorem is a statement of the relation between a function expressed in terms of dimensional parameters and a related function expressed interms of nondimensional parameters.

The functional relation among the independent dimensionless Πparameters must be determined experimentally. The n2mdimensionless Πparameters obtained from the procedure are inde- pendent. A Πparameter is not independent if it can be formed from any combination of one or more of the other Πparameters. For example, if Π552Π1 Π2Π3or Π65Π3=4 1 Π2 3 then neither Π5norΠ6is independent of the other dimensionless parameters. Several methods for determining the dimensionless parameters are available. A detailed procedure is presented in the next section. 7.4 Determining the ΠGroups Regardless of the method to be used to determine the dimensionless parameters, one begins by listing all dimensional parameters that are known (or believed) to affect thegiven ﬂow phenomenon. Some experience admittedly is helpful in compiling the list.Students, who do not have this experience, often are troubled by the need to applyengineering judgment in an apparent massive dose. However, it is difﬁcult to go wrongif a generous selection of parameters is made. If you suspect that a phenomenon depends on a given parameter, include it. If your suspicion is correct, experiments will show that the parameter must be included to getconsistent results. If the parameter is extraneous, an extra Πparameter may result, but experiments will later show that it may be eliminated. Therefore, do not be afraid toinclude allthe parameters that you feel are important. The six steps listed below (which may seem a bit abstract but are actually easy to do) outline a recommended procedure for determining the Πparameters: Step 1. List all the dimensional parameters involved .( L e t nbe the number of param- eters.) If all of the pertinent parameters are not included, a relation may beobtained, but it will not give the complete story. If parameters that actuallyhave no effect on the physical phenomenon are included, either the process of dimensional analysis will show that these do not enter the relation sought, or one or more dimensionless groups will be obtained that experiments willshow to be extraneous. Step 2. Select a set of fundamental (primary) dimensions, e.g., MLt or FLt . (Note that for heat transfer problems you may also need Tfor temperature, and in electrical systems, qfor charge.)7.4 Determining the ΠGroups 297Step 3. List the dimensions of all parameters in terms of primary dimensions . (Let rbe the number of primary dimensions.) Either force or mass may be selected as a primary dimension. Step 4. Select a set of r dimensional parameters that includes all the primary dimen-sions . These parameters will all be combined with each of the remaining parameters, one of those at a time, and so will be called repeating parameters.No repeating parameter should have dimensions that are a power of thedimensions of another repeating parameter; for example, do not include bothan area ( L 2) and a second moment of area ( L4) as repeating parameters. The repeating parameters chosen may appear in all the dimensionless groupsobtained; consequently, do notinclude the dependent parameter among those selected in this step. Step 5. Set up dimensional equations, combining the parameters selected in Step 4 witheach of the other parameters in turn, to form dimensionless groups . (There will ben2mequations.) Solve the dimensional equations to obtain the n2m dimensionless groups. Step 6. Check to see that each group obtained is dimensionless . If mass was initially selected as a primary dimension, it is wise to check the groups using force as aprimary dimension, or vice versa. The functional relationship among the Πparameters must be determined experi- mentally. The detailed procedure for determining the dimensionless Πparameters is illustrated in Examples 7.1 and 7.2. Example 7.1 DRAG FORCE ON A SMOOTH SPHERE As noted in Section 7.2, the drag force, F, on a smooth sphere depends on the relative speed, V, the sphere diameter, D, the ﬂuid density, ρ, and the ﬂuid viscosity, μ.

In a few cases, trouble arises because the number of primary dimensions differs when variables areexpressed in terms of different systems of dimensions (e.g., MLt orFLt). The value of mcan be established with certainty by determining the rank of the dimensional matrix; that rank is m. Although not needed in most applications, for completeness, this procedure is illustrated in Example 7.3. Then2mdimensionless groups obtained from the procedure are independent but not unique. If a different set of repeating parameters is chosen, different groups result.The repeating parameters are so named because they may appear in all the dimen- sionless groups obtained. Based on experience, viscosity should appear in only one dimensionless parameter. Therefore μshould notbe chosen as a repeating parameter. When we have a choice, it usually works out best to choose density ρ(dimensions M/L 3 in the MLt system), speed V(dimensions L/t), and characteristic length L(dimension L) as repeating parameters because experience shows this generally leads to a set ofdimensionless parameters that are suitable for correlating a wide range of experimentaldata; in addition, ρ,V, and Lare usually fairly easy to measure or otherwise obtain. The values of the dimensionless parameters obtained using these repeating parameters almost always have a very tangible meaning, telling you the relative strength of various ﬂuid forces (e.g., viscous) to inertia forces—we will discuss several “classic” ones shortly. It’s also worth stressing that, given the parameters you’re combining, we can often determine the unique dimensional parameters by inspection. For example, if we hadrepeating parameters ρ,V, and Land were combining them with a parameter A f, representing the frontal area of an object, it’s fairly obvious that only the combinationA f/L2is dimensionless; experienced ﬂuid mechanicians also know that ρV2produces dimensions of stress, so any time a stress or force parameter arises, dividing by ρV2or ρV2L2will produce a dimensionless quantity. We will ﬁnd useful a measure of the magnitude of ﬂuid inertia forces, obtained from Newton’s second law, F5ma; the dimensions of inertia force are thus MLt/C02. Using ρ,V,a n dL to build the dimensions of maleads to the unique combination ρV2L2(only ρhas dimension M, and only V2will produce dimension t/C02;L2is then required to leave us with MLt/C02). Ifn2m51, then a single dimensionless Πparameter is obtained. In this case, the Buckingham Pi theorem indicates that the single Πparameter must be a constant. Example 7.3 CAPILLARY EFFECT: USE OF DIMENSIONAL MATRIX When a small tube is dipped into a pool of liquid, surface tension causes a meniscusto form at the free surface, which is elevated or depressed depending on the contact angle at the liquid-solid-gas interface. Experiments indicate that the magnitude of this capillary effect, Δh, is a function of the tube diameter, D, liquid speciﬁc weight, γ, and surface tension, σ. Determine the number of inde- pendent Πparameters that can be formed and obtain a set. Given: Δh5f(D,γ,σ) Find: (a) Number of independent Πparameters. (b) One set of Πparameters.

Following tradition, each such group has been giventhe name of a prominent scientist or engineer, usually the one who pioneered its use.Several are so fundamental and occur so frequently in ﬂuid mechanics that we shouldtake time to learn their deﬁnitions. Understanding their physical signiﬁcance alsogives insight into the phenomena we study. Forces encountered in ﬂowing ﬂuids include those due to inertia, viscosity, pressure, gravity, surface tension, and compressibility. The ratio of any two forces will be dimen- sionless. We have previously shown that the inertia force is proportional to ρV 2L2. We can now compare the relative magnitudes of various ﬂuid forces to the inertia force, using the following scheme: Viscous force B τA5μdu dyA~μV LL25μVL soviscous inertiaBμVL ρV2L25μ ρVL Pressure force B ΔpA~ΔpL2sopressure inertiaBΔpL2 ρV2L25Δp ρV2 Gravity force B mg~gρL3sogravity inertiaBgρL3 ρV2L25gL V26Check, using F,L,tdimensions ½Π1/C1385Δh D2 435 and L L51 ½Π2/C1385σ D2γ2 435 and F L1 L2L3 F51Check, using M,L, tdimensions ½Π1/C1385Δh D2 435 and L L51 ½Π2/C1385σ D2γ2 435 and M t21 L2L2t2 M51 Therefore, both systems of dimensions yield the same dimensionless Πparameters.

The ﬁrst parameter, μ/ρVL, is by tradition inverted to the form ρVL/μ, and was actually explored independently of dimensional analysis in the 1880s by OsborneReynolds, the British engineer, who studied the transition between laminar and tur-bulent ﬂow regimes in a tube. He discovered that the parameter (later named after him) Re5 ρVD μ5VD ν is a criterion by which the ﬂow regime may be determined. Later experiments haveshown that the Reynolds number is a key parameter for other ﬂow cases as well. Thus, in general, Re5ρVL μ5VL νð7:11Þ where Lis a characteristic length descriptive of the ﬂow ﬁeld geometry. The Reynolds number is the ratio of inertia forces to viscous forces. Flows with “large”Reynolds number generally are turbulent. Flows in which the inertia forces are “small”compared with the viscous forces are characteristically laminar ﬂows. In aerodynamic and other model testing, it is convenient to modify the second parameter, Δp/ρV 2, by inserting a factor1 2to make the denominator represent the dynamic pressure (the factor, of course, does not affect the dimensions). The ratio Eu5Δp 1 2ρV2ð7:12Þ is formed, where Δpis the local pressure minus the freestream pressure, and ρandV are properties of the freestream ﬂow. This ratio has been named after Leonhard Euler, the Swiss mathematician who did much early analytical work in ﬂuidmechanics. Euler is credited with being the ﬁrst to recognize the role of pressure inﬂuid motion; the Euler equations of Chapter 6 demonstrate this role. The Euler number is the ratio of pressure forces to inertia forces. The Euler number is often called the pressure coefﬁcient ,C p. In the study of cavitation phenomena, the pressure difference, Δp, is taken as Δp5p2pv, where pis the pressure in the liquid stream, and pvis the liquid vapor pressure at the test temperature. Combining these with ρandVin the stream yields the dimensionless parameter called the cavitation number , Ca5p2pv 1 2ρV2ð7:13Þ The smaller the cavitation number, the more likely cavitation is to occur. This is usually an unwanted phenomenon.304 Chapter 7Dimensional Analysis and SimilitudeWilliam Froude was a British naval architect. Together with his son, Robert Edmund Froude, he discovered that the parameter Fr5VﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃgLp ð7:14Þ was signiﬁcant for ﬂows with free surface effects. Squaring the Froude number gives Fr25V2 gL which may be interpreted as the ratio of inertia forces to gravity forces (it is the inverse of the third force ratio, V2/gL, that we discussed above). The length, L,i s a characteristic length descriptive of the ﬂow ﬁeld. In the case of open-channel ﬂow,the characteristic length is the water depth; Froude numbers less than unity indicatesubcritical ﬂow and values greater than unity indicate supercritical ﬂow. We will havemuch more to say on this in Chapter 11. By convention, the inverse of the fourth force ratio, σ/ρV 2L, discussed above, is called the Weber number; it indicates the ratio of inertia to surface tension forces We5ρV2L σð7:15Þ The value of the Weber number is indicative of the existence of, and frequency of,capillary waves at a free surface. In the 1870s, the Austrian physicist Ernst Mach introduced the parameter M5V cð7:16Þ where Vis the ﬂow speed and cis the local sonic speed. Analysis and experiments have shown that the Mach number is a key parameter that characterizes compressi- bility effects in a ﬂow. The Mach number may be written M5V c5Vﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ dp dρs5Vﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Ev ρs or M25ρV2L2 EvL25ρV2 Ev which is the inverse of the ﬁnal force ratio, Ev/ρV2, discussed above, and can be interpreted as a ratio of inertia forces to forces due to compressibility. For trulyincompressible ﬂow (and note that under some conditions even liquids are quite compressible), c5Nso that M50. Equations 7.11 through 7.16 are some of the most commonly used dimensionless groupings in ﬂuid mechanics because for any ﬂow pattern they immediately (even before performing any experiments or analysis) indicate the relative importance ofinertia, viscosity, pressure, gravity, surface tension, and compressibility. 7.6 Flow Similarity and Model Studies To be useful, a model test must yield data that can be scaled to obtain the forces,moments, and dynamic loads that would exist on the full-scale prototype. Whatconditions must be met to ensure the similarity of model and prototype ﬂows?7.6 Flow Similarity and Model Studies 305Perhaps the most obvious requirement is that the model and prototype must be geometrically similar. Geometric similarity requires that the model and prototype be the same shape, and that all linear dimensions of the model be related to corre- sponding dimensions of the prototype by a constant scale factor. A second requirement is that the model and prototype ﬂows must be kinematically similar . Two ﬂows are kinematically similar when the velocities at corresponding points are in the same direction and differ only by a constant scale factor. Thus two ﬂows that are kinematically similar also have streamline patterns related by a constantscale factor. Since the boundaries form the bounding streamlines, ﬂows that arekinematically similar must be geometrically similar. In principle, in order to model the performance in an inﬁnite ﬂow ﬁeld correctly, kinematic similarity would require that a wind tunnel of inﬁnite cross section be usedto obtain data for drag on an object. In practice, this restriction may be relaxedconsiderably, permitting use of equipment of reasonable size. Kinematic similarity requires that the regimes of ﬂow be the same for model and prototype. If compressibility or cavitation effects, which may change even the quali-tative patterns of ﬂow, are not present in the prototype ﬂow, they must be avoided inthe model ﬂow. When two ﬂows have force distributions such that identical types of forces are parallel and are related in magnitude by a constant scale factor at all correspondingpoints, the ﬂows are dynamically similar . The requirements for dynamic similarity are the most restrictive. Kinematic simi- larity requires geometric similarity; kinematic similarity is a necessary, but not sufﬁ-cient, requirement for dynamic similarity. To establish the conditions required for complete dynamic similarity, all forces that are important in the ﬂow situation must be considered. Thus the effects of viscousforces, of pressure forces, of surface tension forces, and so on, must be considered. Test conditions must be established such that all important forces are related by the same scale factor between model and prototype ﬂows. When dynamic similarity exists,data measured in a model ﬂow may be related quantitatively to conditions in theprototype ﬂow. What, then, are the conditions that ensure dynamic similarity betweenmodel and prototype ﬂows? The Buckingham Pi theorem may be used to obtain the governing dimensionless groups for a ﬂow phenomenon; to achieve dynamic similarity between geometricallysimilar ﬂows, we must make sure that each independent dimensionless group has the same value in the model and in the prototype. Then not only will the forces have the same relative importance, but also the dependent dimensionless groupwill have the same value in the model and prototype. For example, in considering the drag force on a sphere in Example 7.1, we began with F5fðD,V,ρ,μÞ The Buckingham Pi theorem predicted the functional relation F ρV2D25f1ρVD μ/C18/C19 In Section 7.5 we showed that the dimensionless parameters can be viewed as ratios offorces. Thus, in considering a model ﬂow and a prototype ﬂow about a sphere (the ﬂows are geometrically similar), the ﬂows also will be dynamically similar if the value of the independent parameter, ρVD/μ, is duplicated between model and prototype, i.e., if ρVD μ/C18/C19 model5ρVD μ/C18/C19 prototype VIDEO Geometric, Not Dynamic, Similarity: Flow Past a Block 1. VIDEO Geometric, Not Dynamic, Similarity:Flow Past a Block 2. 306 Chapter 7Dimensional Analysis and SimilitudeFurthermore, if Remodel5Reprototype then the value of the dependent parameter, F/ρV2D2, in the functional relationship, will be duplicated between model and prototype, i.e., F ρV2D2/C18/C19 model5F ρV2D2/C18/C19 prototype and the results determined from the model study can be used to predict the drag on the full-scale prototype. The actual force on the object caused by the ﬂuid is not the same for the model and prototype, but the value of its dimensionless group is. The two tests can be run usingdifferent ﬂuids, if desired, as long as the Reynolds numbers are matched. For experimental convenience, test data can be measured in a wind tunnel in air and the results used to predict drag in water, as illustrated in Example 7.4. Example 7.4 SIMILARITY: DRAG OF A SONAR TRANSDUCER The drag of a sonar transducer is to be predicted, based on wind tunnel test data. The prototype, a 1-ft diam-eter sphere, is to be towed at 5 knots (nautical miles per hour) in seawater at 40 /C14F. The model is 6 in. in diameter. Determine the required test speed in air. If the drag of the model at these test conditions is 0.60 lbf, estimate thedrag of the prototype. Given: Sonar transducer to be tested in a wind tunnel. Find: (a)V m. (b)Fp. Solution: Since the prototype operates in water and the model test is to be performed in air, useful results can be expected onlyif cavitation effects are absent in the prototype ﬂow and compressibility effects are absent from the model test.Under these conditions, F ρV2D25fρVD μ/C18/C19 and the test should be run at Remodel5Reprototype to ensure dynamic similarity.

Fm = 0.60 lbf Air7.6 Flow Similarity and Model Studies 307Incomplete Similarity We have shown that to achieve complete dynamic similarity between geometrically similar ﬂows, it is necessary to duplicate the values of the independent dimensionlessgroups; by so doing the value of the dependent parameter is then duplicated. In the simpliﬁed situation of Example 7.4, duplicating the Reynolds number value between model and prototype ensured dynamically similar ﬂows. Testing in airallowed the Reynolds number to be duplicated exactly (this also could have been accomplished in a water tunnel for this situation). The drag force on a sphere actually depends on the nature of the boundary-layer ﬂow. Therefore, geometric similarityrequires that the relative surface roughness of the model and prototype be the same.This means that relative roughness also is a parameter that must be duplicatedbetween model and prototype situations. If we assume that the model was constructedcarefully, measured values of drag from model tests could be scaled to predict drag forthe operating conditions of the prototype. In many model studies, to achieve dynamic similarity requires duplication of sev- eral dimensionless groups. In some cases, complete dynamic similarity between modeland prototype may not be attainable. Determining the drag force (resistance) of asurface ship is an example of such a situation. Resistance on a surface ship arises fromskin friction on the hull (viscous forces) and surface wave resistance (gravity forces).Complete dynamic similarity requires that both Reynolds and Froude numbers beduplicated between model and prototype. In general it is not possible to predict wave resistance analytically, so it must be modeled. This requires that Fr m5Vm ðgLmÞ1=25Frp5Vp ðgLpÞ1=2For air at STP, ρ50.00238 slug/ft3andν51.5731024ft2/s.

However, it is only about an order of magnitude less, so the kinematicviscosity ratio required to duplicate Reynolds numbers cannot be attained. We conclude that we have a problem: it is impossible in practice for this model/ prototype scale of 1 100to satisfy both the Reynolds number and Froude number criteria; at best we will be able to satisfy only one of them. In addition, water is the only practical ﬂuid for most model tests of free-surface ﬂows. To obtain complete dynamic similarity then would require a full-scale test. However, all is not lost: Modelstudies do provide useful information even though complete similarity cannot beobtained. As an example, Fig. 7.2 shows data from a test of a 1:80 scale model of a shipconducted at the U.S. Naval Academy Hydromechanics Laboratory. The plot displays“resistance coefﬁcient” data versus Froude number. The square points are calculatedfrom values of total resistance measured in the test. We would like to obtain thecorresponding total resistance curve for the full-scale ship. If you think about it, we can only measure the total drag (the square data points). The total drag is due to both wave resistance (dependent on the Froude number) andfriction resistance (dependent on the Reynolds number), and it’s not possible todetermine experimentally how much each contributes. We cannot use the total drag curve of Fig. 7.2 for the full-scale ship because, as we have discussed above, we cannever set up the model conditions so that its Reynolds number andFroude number match those of the full-scale ship. Nevertheless, we would like to extract from Fig. 7.2the corresponding total drag curve for the full-scale ship. In many experimental situations we need to use a creative “trick” to come up with a solution. In this case, the experimenters used boundary-layer theory (which we discuss in Chapter 9) to predict the viscous resistance component of the model (shown as diamonds in Fig. 7.2);then they estimated the wave resistance (not obtainable from theory) by simplysubtracting this theoretical viscous resistance from the experimental total resistance,point by point (shown as circles in Fig. 7.2). Using this clever idea (typical of the kind of experimental and analytical approaches experimentalists need to employ), Fig. 7.2 therefore gives the wave7.6 Flow Similarity and Model Studies 309resistance of the model as a function of Froude number. It is also valid for the full- scale ship, because wave resistance depends only on the Froude number! We can now build a graph similar to Fig. 7.2 valid for the full-scale ship: Simply compute from boundary-layer theory the viscous resistance of the full-scale ship and add this to thewave resistance values, point by point. The result is shown in Fig. 7.3. The waveresistance points are identical to those in Fig. 7.2; the viscous resistance points arecomputed from theory (and are different from those of Fig. 7.2); and the predictedtotal resistance curve for the full-scale ship is ﬁnally obtained.0.008 0.0060.004 0.002 0.000 –0.0020 0.1 0.2 0.3 Froude number0.4Wave resistanceViscous resistanceTotal resistance 0.5 0.6Resistance coefficient Fig. 7.3 Resistance of full-scale ship predicted from model test results.

(Data from U.S. Naval Academy Hydromechanics Laboratory, courtesy of Professor Bruce Johnson.)310 Chapter 7Dimensional Analysis and SimilitudeIn this example, incomplete modeling was overcome by using analytical compu- tations; the model experiments modeled the Froude number, but not the Reynolds number. Because the Reynolds number cannot be matched for model tests of surface ships, the boundary-layer behavior is not the same for model and prototype. The modelReynolds number is only ( L m/Lp)3/2as large as the prototype value, so the extent of laminar ﬂow in the boundary layer on the model is too large by a correspondingfactor. The method just described assumes that boundary-layer behavior can bescaled. To make this possible, the model boundary layer is “tripped” or “stimulated”to become turbulent at a location that corresponds to the behavior on the full-scalevessel. “Studs” were used to stimulate the boundary layer for the model test results shown in Fig. 7.2. A correction sometimes is added to the full-scale coefﬁcients calculated from model test data. This correction accounts for roughness, waviness, and unevenness that inevitably are more pronounced on the full-scale ship than on the model. Com-parisons between predictions from model tests and measurements made in full-scaletrials suggest an overall accuracy within 65 percent [5]. As we will see in Chapter 11, the Froude number is an important parameter in the modeling of rivers and harbors. In these situations it is not practical to obtain com- plete similarity. Use of a reasonable model scale would lead to extremely small water depths, so that viscous forces and surface tension forces would have much largerrelative effects in the model ﬂow than in the prototype. Consequently, different lengthscales are used for the vertical and horizontal directions. Viscous forces in the deepermodel ﬂow are increased using artiﬁcial roughness elements. Emphasis on fuel economy has made reduction of aerodynamic drag important for automobiles, trucks, and buses. Most work on development of low-drag conﬁgurations is done using model tests. Traditionally, automobile models have been built to 3 8scale, at which a model of a full-size automobile has a frontal area of about 0.3 m2. Thus testing can be done in a wind tunnel with test section area of 6 m2or larger. At3 8scale, a wind speed of about 150 mph is needed to model a prototype automobile traveling at the legal speed limit. Thus there is no problem with compressibility effects, but thescale models are expensive and time-consuming to build. A large wind tunnel (test section dimensions are 5.4 m high, 10.4 m wide, and 21.3 m long; maximum air speed is 250 km/hr with the tunnel empty) is used byGeneral Motors to test full-scale automobiles at highway speeds. The large test sec- tion allows use of production autos or of full-scale clay mockups of proposed auto body styles. Many other vehicle manufacturers are using comparable facilities; Fig. 7.4shows a full-size sedan under test in the Volvo wind tunnel. The relatively low speedpermits ﬂow visualization using tufts or “smoke” streams. 1Using full-size “models,” stylists and engineers can work together to achieve optimum results. It is harder to achieve dynamic similarity in tests of trucks and buses; models must be made to smaller scale than those for automobiles.2A large scale for truck and bus testing is 1:8. To achieve complete dynamic similarity by matching Reynolds numbers at this scale would require a test speed of 440 mph. This would introduce unwanted compressibility effects, and model and prototype ﬂows would not be kinematicallysimilar. Fortunately, trucks and buses are “bluff” objects. Experiments show thatabove a certain Reynolds number, their nondimensional drag becomes independent 1A mixture of liquid nitrogen and steam may be used to produce “smoke” streaklines that evaporate and do not clog the ﬁne mesh screens used to reduce the turbulence level in a wind tunnel. Streaklines may be made to appear “colored” in photos by placing a ﬁlter over the camera lens. This and other techniques for ﬂow visualization are detailed in Reference [6] and Merzkirch [7]. 2The vehicle length is particularly important in tests at large yaw angles to simulate crosswind behavior. Tunnel blockage considerations limit the acceptable model size. See Reference [8] for recommendedpractices.7.6 Flow Similarity and Model Studies 311of Reynolds number [8]. (Figure 7.1 actually shows an example of this—for a sphere, the dimensionless drag is approximately constant for 2000 ,Re,23105.) Although similarity is not complete, measured test data can be scaled to predict prototype dragforces. The procedure is illustrated in Example 7.5.

Scaling with Multiple Dependent Parameters In some situations of practical importance there may be more than one dependent parameter. In such cases, dimensionless groups must be formed separately for eachdependent parameter. As an example, consider a typical centrifugal pump. The detailed ﬂow pattern within a pump changes with volume ﬂow rate and speed; these changes affect thepump’s performance. Performance parameters of interest include the pressure rise (orhead) developed, the power input required, and the machine efﬁciency measuredunder speciﬁc operating conditions. 3Performance curves are generated by varying an independent parameter such as the volume ﬂow rate. Thus the independent variablesare volume ﬂow rate, angular speed, impeller diameter, and ﬂuid properties.Dependent variables are the several performance quantities of interest. Finding dimensionless parameters begins from the symbolic equations for the dependence of head, h(energy per unit mass, L 2/t2), and power, 3, on the indepen- dent parameters, given by h5g1ðQ,ρ,ω,D,μÞ and 35g2ðQ,ρ,ω,D,μÞ Straightforward use of the Pi theorem gives the dimensionless head coefﬁcient and power coefﬁcient as h ω2D25f1Q ωD3,ρωD2 μ/C18/C19 ð7:17ÞThe corresponding power required to overcome aerodynamic drag is 3p5FDpVp 51:713103N3100km hr31000m km 3hr 3600 s3W/C1s N/C1m 3p547:5k W ß3pThisprob lem illustratesacommonphenomenoninaero dynamics:AboveacertainminimumReynoldsnumberthedragcoefﬁcientofanobjectusuallyapproachesaconstant—thatis,becomesindependentoftheReynoldsnumber.Hence,inthesesitua tionswedonothave tomatchtheReynoldsnumbersofthemodelandprototypeinorderforthemtohavethesamedragcoefﬁcient—aconsiderableadvantage.However, theSAE RecommendedPrac tices[8]suggestsRe$23106fortruckand bustesting. 3Efﬁciency is deﬁned as the ratio of power delivered to the ﬂuid divided by input power, η53/3in. For incompressible ﬂow, we will see in Chapter 8 that the energy equation reduces to 35ρQh(when “head” h is expressed as energy per unit mass) or to 35ρgQH (when head His expressed as energy per unit weight).314 Chapter 7Dimensional Analysis and Similitudeand 3 ρω3D55f2Q ωD3,ρωD2 μ/C18/C19 ð7:18Þ The dimensionless parameter Q=ωD3in these equations is called the ﬂow co- efﬁcient . The dimensionless parameter ρωD2=μð~ρVD=μÞis a form of Reynolds number. Head and power in a pump are developed by inertia forces. Both the ﬂow pattern within a pump and the pump performance change with volume ﬂow rate and speed of rotation. Performance is difﬁcult to predict analytically except at the design pointof the pump, so it is measured experimentally. Typical characteristic curves plottedfrom experimental data for a centrifugal pump tested at constant speed are shownin Fig. 7.5 as functions of volume ﬂow rate. The head, power, and efﬁciency curves in Fig. 7.5 are smoothed through points calculated from measured data. Maximum efﬁciency usually occurs at the design point. Complete similarity in pump performance tests would require identical ﬂow coefﬁcients and Reynolds numbers. In practice, it has been found that viscous effectsare relatively unimportant when two geometrically similar machines operate under“similar” ﬂow conditions. Thus, from Eqs. 7.17 and 7.18, when Q1 ω1D3 15Q2 ω2D3 2ð7:19Þ it follows that h1 ω2 1D215h2 ω2 2D22ð7:20Þ and 31 ρ1ω3 1D51532 ρ2ω3 2D52ð7:21Þ The empirical observation that viscous effects are unimportant under similar ﬂow conditions allows use of Eqs. 7.19 through 7.21 to scale the performance charac- teristics of machines to different operating conditions, as either the speed or diameter is changed. These useful scaling relationships are known as pump or fan “laws.” If operating conditions for one machine are known, operating conditions for any geo-metrically similar machine can be found by changing Dandωaccording to Eqs. 7.19 through 7.21. (More details on dimensional analysis, design, and performance curvesfor ﬂuid machinery are presented in Chapter 10.)

If we designate Π15Q=ωD3andΠ25h=ω2D2, then the ratio Π1=2 1=Π3=4 2is another dimensionless parameter; this parameter is the speciﬁc speed, N s, Ns5ωQ1=2 h3=4ð7:22aÞ The speciﬁc speed, as deﬁned in Eq. 7.22a, is a dimensionless parameter (provided that the head, h, is expressed as energy per unit mass). You may think of speciﬁc speed as the speed required for a machine to produce unit head at unit volume ﬂow rate. Aconstant speciﬁc speed describes all operating conditions of geometrically similarmachines with similar ﬂow conditions. Although speciﬁc speed is a dimensionless parameter, it is common practice to use a convenient but inconsistent set of units in specifying the variables ωandQ, and to use the energy per unit weight Hin place of energy per unit mass hin Eq. 7.22a. When this is done the speciﬁc speed, Nscu5ωQ1=2 H3=4ð7:22bÞ is not a unitless parameter and its magnitude depends on the units used to calculate it. Customary units used in U.S. engineering practice for pumps are rpm for ω, gpm for Q, and feet (energy per unit weight) for H. In these customary U.S. units, “low” speciﬁc speed means 500 ,Nscu,4000 and “high” means 10,000 ,Nscu,15,000. Example 7.6 illustrates use of the pump scaling laws and speciﬁc speed parameter. More details of speciﬁc speed calculations and additional examples of applications toﬂuid machinery are presented in Chapter 10. Example 7.6 PUMP “LAWS” A centrifugal pump has an efﬁciency of 80 percent at its design-point speciﬁc speed of 2000 (units of rpm, gpm,and feet). The impeller diameter is 8 in. At design-point ﬂow conditions, the volume ﬂow rate is 300 gpm of water at1170 rpm. To obtain a higher ﬂow rate, the pump is to be ﬁtted with a 1750 rpm motor. Use the pump “laws” to ﬁndthe design-point performance characteristics of the pump at the higher speed. Show that the speciﬁc speed remainsconstant for the higher operating speed. Determine the motor size required. Given: Centrifugal pump with design speciﬁc speed of 2000 (in rpm, gpm, and feet units). Impeller diameter is D58 in.

As in all experimental work, careful planning and executionare needed to obtain valid results. Models must be constructed carefully and accu-rately, and they must include sufﬁcient detail in areas critical to the phenomenon being measured. Aerodynamic balances or other force measuring systems must be aligned carefully and calibrated correctly. Mounting methods must be devised thatoffer adequate rigidity and model motion, yet do not interfere with the phenomenonbeing measured. References [13 /C015] are considered the standard sources for details of wind tunnel test techniques. More specialized techniques for water impact testingare described in Waugh and Stubstad [16]. Experimental facilities must be designed and constructed carefully. The quality of ﬂow in a wind tunnel must be documented. Flow in the test section should be as nearly uniform as possible (unless the desire is to simulate a special proﬁle such as an atmospheric boundary layer), free from angularity, and with little swirl. If they interfere with measurements, boundary layers on tunnel walls must beremoved by suction or energized by blowing. Pressure gradients in a wind tunneltest section may cause erroneous drag-force readings due to pressure variations inthe ﬂow direction. Special facilities are needed for unusual conditions or for special test requirements, especially to achieve large Reynolds numbers. Many facilities are so large or spe- cialized that they cannot be supported by university laboratories or private industry.

(California Academy of Sciences) Dimensional analysis, the main topic of this chapter, is used in many scientiﬁc pursuits. It has even beenused by Professor Alexander McNeil, now at Heriot-WattUniversity in Scotland, to try to determine the speed atwhich dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus rex may have been able to run. The only data available on these crea-tures are in the fossil record—the most pertinent databeing the dinosaurs’ average leg length land stride s. Could these data be used to extract the dinosaurs’speed? Comparing data on land sand the speed Vof quadrupeds (e.g., horses, dogs) and bipeds (e.g.,humans) does not indicate a pattern, unless dimensionalanalysis is used to learn that all of the data should be plotted in the following way: Plot the dimensionless quantity V 2/gl(where Vis the measured speed of the animal and gis the acceleration of gravity) against the dimensionless ratio s/l.W h e nt h i si sd o n e ,“ m a g i - cally” the data for most animals fall approximately onone curve! Hence, the running behavior of most animalscan be obtained from the graph: In this case, the dino-saurs’ value of s/lallows a corresponding value of V 2/glto be interpolated from the curve, leading to an estimate forVof dinosaurs (because land gare known). Based on this, in contrast to the Jurassic Park movies, it seems likely that humans could easily outrun T. rex !References 3196.“Aerodynamic Flow Visualization Techniques and Proce- dures.” Warrendale, PA: Society of Automotive Engineers, SAE Information Report HS J1566, January 1986.7.Merzkirch, W., Flow Visualization , 2nd ed.

Problems Nondimensionalizing the Basic Differential Equations Many of the Problems in this chapter involve obtaining the Π groups that characterize a problem. The Excel workbook used in Example 7.1 is useful for performing the computationsinvolved. To avoid needless duplication, the computer symbol will only be used next to Problems when they have an addi- tional beneﬁt (e.g., for graphing). 7.1The propagation speed of small-amplitude surface waves in a region of uniform depth is given by c25σ ρ2π λ1gλ 2π/C18/C19 tanh2πh λ where his depth of the undisturbed liquid and λis wave- length.

Assuming dynamic similarity, estimate the aerodynamic dragforce on the full-scale vehicle at V= 75 ft/s. Calculate the power needed to overcome this drag force if there is no wind. 7.75 Tests are performed on a 1:10-scale boat model. What must be the kinematic viscosity of the model ﬂuid if frictionand wave drag phenomena are to be correctly modeled?The full-size boat will be used in a freshwater lake where the average water temperature is 50 /C14F. 7.76 Your favorite professor likes mountain climbing, so there is always a possibility that the professor may fall into a cre- vasse in some glacier. If that happened today, and the pro-fessor was trapped in a slowly moving glacier, you are curious to know whether the professor would reappear at the down- stream drop-off of the glacier during this academic year.Assuming ice is a Newtonian ﬂuid with the density of glyc- erine but a million times as viscous, you decide to build a glycerin model and use dimensional analysis and similarity toestimate when the professor would reappear. Assume the real glacier is 15 m deep and is on a slope that falls 1.5 m in a horizontal distance of 1850 m. Develop the dimensionlessparameters and conditions expected to govern dynamic simi-larity in this problem. If the model professor reappears in the laboratory after 9.6 hours, when should you return to the end of the real glacier to provide help to your favorite professor? 7.77 An automobile is to travel through standard air at 60 mph. To determine the pressure distribution, a1 5-scale model is to be tested in water. What factors must be con- sidered to ensure kinematic similarity in the tests? Deter-mine the water speed that should be used. What is the corresponding ratio of drag force between prototype and model ﬂows? The lowest pressure coefﬁcient is C p521.4 at the location of the minimum static pressure on the surface. Estimate the minimum tunnel pressure required to avoid cavitation, if the onset of cavitation occurs at a cavitationnumber of 0.5. 7.78 A 1:50-scale model of a submarine is to be tested in a towing tank under two conditions: motion at the free surface and motion far below the surface. The tests are performed in freshwater. On the surface, the submarine cruises at 24knots. At what speed should the model be towed to ensure dynamic similarity? Far below the surface, the sub cruises at 0.35 knot. At what speed should the model be towed toensure dynamic similarity? What must the drag of the model be multiplied by under each condition to give the drag of the full-scale submarine? 7.79 A wind tunnel is being used to study the aerodynamics of a full-scale model rocket that is 12 in. long. Scaling for drag calculations are based on the Reynolds number. The rocket has an expected maximum velocity of 120 mph. Whatis the Reynolds number at this speed? Assume ambient air isat 68 /C14F. The wind tunnel is capable of speeds up to 100 mph; so an attempt is made to improve this top speed by varyingProblems 325the air temperature. Calculate the equivalent speed for the wind tunnel using air at 40/C14F and 150/C14F. Would replacing air with carbon dioxide provide higher equivalent speeds? 7.80 Consider water ﬂow around a circular cylinder, of diam- eterDand length l. In addition to geometry, the drag force is known to depend on liquid speed, V, density, ρ, and vis- cosity, μ. Express drag force, FD, in dimensionless form as a function of all relevant variables. The static pressure dis- tribution on a circular cylinder, measured in the laboratory, can be expressed in terms of the dimensionless pressurecoefﬁcient; the lowest pressure coefﬁcient is C p522.4 at the location of the minimum static pressure on the cylinder surface. Estimate the maximum speed at which a cylinder could be towed in water at atmospheric pressure,without causing cavitation, if the onset of cavitation occurs at a cavitation number of 0.5. 7.81 A circular container, partially ﬁlled with water, is rotated about its axis at constant angular speed, ω. At any time, τ, from the start of rotation, the speed, Vθ, at distance r from the axis of rotation, was found to be a function of τ,ω, and the properties of the liquid. Write the dimensionless parameters that characterize this problem. If, in anotherexperiment, honey is rotated in the same cylinder at thesame angular speed, determine from your dimensionless parameters whether honey will attain steady motion as quickly as water. Explain why the Reynolds number wouldnot be an important dimensionless parameter in scaling the steady-state motion of liquid in the container. 7.82 A1 10-scale model of a tractor-trailer rig is tested in a wind tunnel. The model frontal area is Am50.1 m2. When tested at Vm575 m/s in standard air, the measured drag force is FD5350 N. Evaluate the drag coefﬁcient for the model conditions given. Assuming that the drag coefﬁcient isthe same for model and prototype, calculate the drag force on a prototype rig at a highway speed of 90 km/hr. Deter-mine the air speed at which a model should be tested to ensure dynamically similar results if the prototype speed is 90 km/hr. Is this air speed practical? Why or why not? 7.83 It is recommended in [8] that the frontal area of a model be less than 5 percent of the wind tunnel test section area andRe5Vw/ν.2310 6, where wis the model width. Further, the model height must be less than 30 percent of the test section height, and the maximum projected width of the model at maximum yaw (20/C14) must be less than 30 percent of the test section width. The maximum air speed should be less than 300 ft/s to avoid compressibility effects. A model of a tractor-trailer rig is to be tested in a wind tunnel that has atest section 1.5 ft high and 2 ft wide. The height, width, and length of the full-scale rig are 13 ft 6 in., 8 ft, and 65 ft, respectively. Evaluate the scale ratio of the largest modelthat meets the recommended criteria. Assess whether an adequate Reynolds number can be achieved in this test facility. 7.84 The power, 3, required to drive a fan is assumed to depend on ﬂuid density ρ, volume ﬂow rate Q, impeller diameter D, and angular speed ω. If a fan with D1= 8 in. delivers Q1=1 5f t3/s of air at ω1= 2500 rpm, what size diameter fan could be expected to deliver Q2=8 8f t3/s ofair at ω2= 1800 rpm, provided they were geometrically and dynamically similar? 7.85 Over a certain range of air speeds, V, the lift, FL, pro- duced by a model of a complete aircraft in a wind tunnel depends on the air speed, air density, ρ, and a characteristic length (the wing base chord length, c5150 mm).

By using Excel to perform a trendline analysis on this curve, generate and plot data for the lift produced by the prototype, which has a wing base chord length of 5 m, over a speed range of 75 m/s to 250 m/s. 7.86 The pressure rise, Δp, of a liquid ﬂowing steadily through a centrifugal pump depends on pump diameter D, angular speed of the rotor ω, volume ﬂow rate Q, and density ρ. The table gives data for the prototype and for a geomet- rically similar model pump. For conditions corresponding todynamic similarity between the model and prototype pumps, calculate the missing values in the table.

The full- size ship will be 150 ft long when built. Estimate the totaldrag when it is cruising at 15 knots and at 20 knots in a freshwater lake. 7.88 A centrifugal water pump running at speed ω= 800 rpm has the following data for ﬂow rate, Q, and pressure head, Δp.

Plot the pressure head versus ﬂow rate curve. Find the two Πparameters for this problem, and, from the above data, plot one against the other. By using Excel to perform a trendline analysis on this latter curve, generate and plot data for pressure head versusﬂow rate for impeller speeds of 600 rpm and 1200 rpm. 7.89 An axial-ﬂow pump is required to deliver 0.75 m3/s of water at a head of 15 J/kg. The diameter of the rotor is 0.25 m, and it is to be driven at 500 rpm. The prototype is to be modeled326 Chapter 7Dimensional Analysis and Similitudeon a small test apparatus having a 2.25 kW, 1000 rpm power supply. For similar performance between the prototype andthe model, calculate the head, volume ﬂow rate, and diameter of the model. 7.90 A model propeller 1 m in diameter is tested in a wind tunnel. Air approaches the propeller at 50 m/s when it rotates at 1800 rpm. The thrust and torque measured under these conditions are 100 N and 10 N /C1m, respectively. A prototype 8 times as large as the model is to be built. At a dynamically similar operating point, the approach air speed is to be 130 m/s. Calculate the speed, thrust, and torque of the prototype propeller under these conditions, neglectingthe effect of viscosity but including density. 7.91 Consider again Problem 7.51. Experience shows that for ship-size propellers, viscous effects on scaling are small.Also, when cavitation is not present, the nondimensionalparameter containing pressure can be ignored. Assume thattorque, T, and power, 3, depend on the same parameters as thrust. For conditions under which effects of μandpcan be neglected, derive scaling “laws” for propellers, similar to thepump “laws” of Section 7.6, that relate thrust, torque, and power to the angular speed and diameter of the propeller. 7.92 Water drops are produced by a mechanism that it is believed follows the pattern dp=D(We)23/5. In this formula, dpis the drop size, Dis proportional to a length scale, and We is the Weber number. In scaling up, if the large-scale characteristic length scale was increased by a factor of 20and the large-scale velocity decreased by a factor of 5, how would the small- and large-scale drops differ from each other for the same material, for example, water? 7.93 Closed-circuit wind tunnels can produce higher speeds than open-circuit tunnels with the same power input becauseenergy is recovered in the diffuser downstream from thetest section. The kinetic energy ratio is a ﬁgure of merit deﬁned as the ratio of the kinetic energy ﬂux in the testsection to the drive power. Estimate the kinetic energy ratio for the 40 ft 380 ft wind tunnel at NASA-Ames described on page 318. 7.94 A 1:16 model of a 60-ft-long truck is tested in a wind tunnel at a speed of 250 ft/s, where the axial static pressure gradient is 20.07 lbf/ft2per foot. The frontal area of the prototype is 110 ft2. Estimate the horizontal buoyancy cor- rection for this situation. Express the correction as a fraction of the measured CD,o fCD= 0.85. 7.95 Frequently one observes a ﬂag on a pole ﬂapping in the wind. Explain why this occurs. 7.96 A 1:16 model of a bus is tested in a wind tunnel in standard air. The model is 152 mm wide, 200 mm high, and762 mm long. The measured drag force at 26.5 m/s wind speed is 6.09 N. The longitudinal pressure gradient in thewind tunnel test section is 211.8 N/m 2/m. Estimate the cor- rection that should be made to the measured drag force to correct for horizontal buoyancy caused by the pressure gra- dient in the test section. Calculate the drag coefﬁcient for themodel. Evaluate the aerodynamic drag force on the proto- type at 100 km/hr on a calm day. 7.97 Explore the variation in wave propagation speed given by the equation of Problem 7.1 for a free-surface ﬂow of water. Find the operating depth to minimize the speed of capillary waves (waves with small wavelength, also called ripples). First assume wavelength is much smaller than waterdepth. Then explore the effect of depth. What depth do you recommend for a water table used to visualize compressible- ﬂow wave phenomena?

The technol-ogy is already quite mature, so new developments willbe incremental: improved blade designs, better con-trols, and composite materials to allow larger turbines.The largest in the world, being built by a Norwegianteam, will be 533 ft tall with a rotor diameter of 475 ft, and it will generate about 10 MW, sufﬁcient for more than 2000 homes. Bearing in mind that the EmpireState Building is 1250 ft tall, this wind turbine willbe huge—so big it must be installed offshore. Engineers are still investigating alternatives to these designs. FloDesign Wind Turbine , a spin-off from the aerospace company FloDesign based in Wilbraham, Massachusetts, is developing a prototype that, according to CEO Stanley Kowalski III, will be up to three times more efﬁcient than conventional windturbines. From the front, the wind turbine looks some-thing like the air intake of a jet engine (not surprisingly,considering FloDesign ’s history). The shaped cowlings shown in the ﬁgure guide the air into spinning vorticesas it exits the device, accelerating the ﬂow and causinga signiﬁcant pressure drop. The incoming wind ﬁrstmeets a set of ﬁxed stator blades, which direct it ontothe rotor blades to extract power from the ﬂow. The exiting air hence has lower energy and velocity than the air ﬂowing around the turbine, but the device’sshroud is so shaped that the relatively fast-movingoutside air is blended with the exiting air in the area justbehind the rotors, creating a low-pressure regionbehind the turbine blades. This is where the device hasan advantage over conventional turbines; the inducedlow-pressure region actually draws air into the device at an increased rate, generating more power. This idea is not new, but past attempts to build similar turbineswere limited by the fact that such a turbine had to bevery precisely aligned with the wind’s direction (within Two views of the FloDesign Wind Turbine (Pictures courtesy of FloDesign Wind Turbine)Internal Incompressible Viscous Flow 329Flows completely bounded by solid surfaces are called internal ﬂows. Thus internal ﬂows include many important and practical ﬂows such as those through pipes, ducts,nozzles, diffusers, sudden contractions and expansions, valves, and ﬁttings. Internal ﬂows may be laminar or turbulent. Some laminar ﬂow cases may be solved analytically. In the case of turbulent ﬂow, analytical solutions are not possible, and wemust rely heavily on semi-empirical theories and on experimental data. The nature oflaminar and turbulent ﬂows was discussed in Section 2.6. For internal ﬂows, the ﬂow regime (laminar or turbulent) is primarily a function of the Reynolds number. In this chapter we will only consider incompressible ﬂows; hence we will study the ﬂow of liquids as well as gases that have negligible heat transfer and for which the Mach number M,0.3; a value of M50.3 in air corresponds to a speed of approximately 100 m/s. Following a brief introduction, this chapter is divided into thefollowing parts: Part A: Part A discusses fully developed laminar ﬂow of a Newtonian ﬂuid between parallel plates and in a pipe. These two cases can be studied analytically. Part B: Part B is about laminar and turbulent ﬂows in pipes and ducts. The laminarﬂow analysis follows from Part A; the turbulent ﬂow (which is the most common) is too complex to be analyzed, so experimental data will be used to develop solution techniques. Part C: Part C is a discussion of methods of ﬂow measurement. 8.1Introduction Laminar versus Turbulent Flow As discussed previously in Section 2.6, the pipe ﬂow regime (laminar or turbulent) isdetermined by the Reynolds number, Re5ρ VD=μ. One can demonstrate, by the classic Reynolds experiment, the qualitative difference between laminar and turbulentﬂows. In this experiment water ﬂows from a large reservoir through a clear tube. Athin ﬁlament of dye injected at the entrance to the tube allows visual observation ofthe ﬂow. At low ﬂow rates (low Reynolds numbers) the dye injected into the ﬂowremains in a single ﬁlament along the tube; there is little dispersion of dye because the ﬂow is laminar. A laminar ﬂow is one in which the ﬂuid ﬂows in laminae, or layers; there is no macroscopic mixing of adjacent ﬂuid layers.about 4/C14); this device will work at angles of up to 20/C14off the wind. Theoretically (as we’ll learn in Chapter 10), conven- tional wind turbines capture a maximum of 59.3 percent of the wind energy. The new design generates as much power as a conventional wind turbine withblades twice as big. The smaller blade size of thenew design means the FloDesign Wind Turbine could be packed closer together than conventional tur-bines, increasing the amount of power that can begenerated per acre of land. Because its blades arelighter and smaller, the design starts spinning and generating power at lower wind speeds, and it is more tolerant of unstable wind patterns, making itexcellent for windy regions where large turbinescannot be used, such as in cities. Smaller blades canalso be allowed to spin faster, reducing the need forexpensive gearboxes that conventional wind turbines must use to connect slow-moving rotors to a high- speed generator. With fewer gears and other movingparts, the company claims it can reduce the numberof components by up to 75 percent, reducing costsand making maintenance easier. FloDesign has already built a small prototype for wind-tunnel tests. Their next step is to build a 12-ft-diameter, 10-kW system for ﬁeld tests. The prototype will be ﬁnished in 2010, with commercial wind turbines to follow. VIDEO The Reynolds Transition Experiment. VIDEO Variable Viscosity Experiment (Animation) . VIDEO Variable Viscosity Experiment: PressureDrop. 330 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous FlowAs the ﬂow rate through the tube is increased, the dye ﬁlament eventually becomes unstable and breaks up into a random motion throughout the tube; the line of dye is stretched and twisted into myriad entangled threads, and it quickly disperses throughout the entire ﬂow ﬁeld. This behavior of turbulent ﬂow is caused by small, high-frequency velocity ﬂuctuations superimposed on the mean motion of a turbulentﬂow, as illustrated earlier in Fig. 2.15; the mixing of ﬂuid particles from adjacent layersof ﬂuid results in rapid dispersion of the dye. We mentioned in Chapter 2 an everydayexample of the difference between laminar and turbulent ﬂow—when you gently turnon the kitchen faucet (not aerated). For very low ﬂow rates, the water exits smoothly(indicating laminar ﬂow in the pipe); for higher ﬂow rates, the ﬂow is churned up(turbulent ﬂow). Under normal conditions, transition to turbulence occurs at Re/C252300 for ﬂow in pipes: For water ﬂow in a 1-in. diameter pipe, this corresponds to an average speed of0.3 ft/s. With great care to maintain the ﬂow free from disturbances, and with smoothsurfaces, experiments have been able to maintain laminar ﬂow in a pipe to a Reynoldsnumber of about 100,000! However, most engineering ﬂow situations are not socarefully controlled, so we will take Re/C252300 as our benchmark for transition to turbulence. Transition Reynolds numbers for some other ﬂow situations are given inthe Examples. Turbulence occurs when the viscous forces in the ﬂuid are unable to damp out random ﬂuctuations in the ﬂuid motion (generated, for example, by roughness of a pipe wall), and the ﬂow becomes chaotic. For example, a high-viscosityﬂuid such as motor oil is able to damp out ﬂuctuations more effectively than a lowviscosity ﬂuid such as water and therefore remains laminar even at relatively high ﬂowrates. On the other hand, a high-density ﬂuid will generate signiﬁcant inertia forcesdue to the random ﬂuctuations in the motion, and this ﬂuid will transition to turbu-lence at a relatively low ﬂow rate. The Entrance Region Figure 8.1 illustrates laminar ﬂow in the entrance region of a circular pipe. The ﬂow has uniform velocity U0at the pipe entrance. Because of the no-slip condition at the wall, we know that the velocity at the wall must be zero along the entire length ofthe pipe. A boundary layer (Section 2.6) develops along the walls of the channel.The solid surface exerts a retarding shear force on the ﬂow; thus the speed of the ﬂuid in the neighborhood of the surface is reduced. At successive sections along the pipe in this entry region, the effect of the solid surface is felt farther out into the ﬂow. For incompressible ﬂow, mass conservation requires that, as the speed close to the wall is reduced, the speed in the central frictionless region of the pipe must increaseslightly to compensate; for this inviscid central region, then, the pressure (as indicatedby the Bernoulli equation) must also drop somewhat. Sufﬁciently far from the pipe entrance, the boundary layer developing on the pipe wall reaches the pipe centerline and the ﬂow becomes entirely viscous. The velocity proﬁle shape then changes slightly after the inviscid core disappears. When the proﬁle shape no longer changes with increasing distance x, the ﬂow is called fully developed .

The actual shape of the fully developed velocity proﬁle depends on whether the ﬂow is laminar or turbulent. In Fig. 8.1 the proﬁle is shown qualitatively for a laminar ﬂow. Although the velocity proﬁles for some fully developedlaminar ﬂows can be obtained by simplifying the complete equations of motion fromChapter 5, turbulent ﬂows cannot be so treated. For laminar ﬂow, it turns out that entrance length, L, is a function of Reynolds number, L DC0:06ρVD μð8:1Þ where V/C17Q=Ais the average velocity (because ﬂow rate Q5AV5AU 0, we have V5U0). Laminar ﬂow in a pipe may be expected only for Reynolds numbers less than Thus the entrance length for laminar pipe ﬂow may be as long as LC0:06ReD#ð0:06Þð2300ÞD5138D or nearly 140 pipe diameters. If the ﬂow is turbulent, enhanced mixing among ﬂuid layers causes more rapid growth of the boundary layer. Experiments show that the mean velocity proﬁle becomes fully developed within 25 to 40 pipe diameters fromthe entrance. However, the details of the turbulent motion may not be fully developedfor 80 or more pipe diameters. We are now ready to study laminar internal ﬂows (PartA), as well as laminar and turbulent ﬂows in pipes and ducts (Part B). For these wewill be focusing on what happens after the entrance region, i.e., fully developed ﬂows. Part A Fully Developed Laminar Flow In this section we consider a few classic examples of fully developed laminar ﬂows.Our intent is to obtain detailed information about the velocity ﬁeld becauseknowledge of the velocity ﬁeld permits calculation of shear stress, pressure drop,and ﬂow rate. 8.2 Fully Developed Laminar Flow Between In ﬁnite Parallel Plates The ﬂow between parallel plates is appealing because the geometry is the simplest possible, but why would there be a ﬂow at all? The answer is that ﬂow could be generated by applying a pressure gradient parallel to the plates, or by moving oneplate parallel with respect to the other, or by having a body force (e.g., gravity)parallel to the plates, or by a combination of these driving mechanisms. We willconsider all of these possibilities. Both Plates Stationary Fluid in high-pressure hydraulic systems (such as the brake system of an automobile)often leaks through the annular gap between a piston and cylinder. For very smallgaps (typically 0.005 mm or less), this ﬂow ﬁeld may be modeled as ﬂow betweeninﬁnite parallel plates, as indicated in the sketch of Fig. 8.2 . To calculate the leakage ﬂow rate, we must ﬁrst determine the velocity ﬁeld. CLASSIC VIDEO Turbulence . VIDEO Fully-Developed Pipe Flow. 332 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous FlowLet us consider the fully developed laminar ﬂow between horizontal inﬁnite par- allel plates. The plates are separated by distance a, as shown in Fig. 8.3 . The plates are considered inﬁnite in the zdirection, with no variation of any ﬂuid property in this direction. The ﬂow is also assumed to be steady and incompressible. Before starting our analysis, what do we know about the ﬂow ﬁeld? For one thing we know that thexcomponent of velocity must be zero at both the upper and lower plates as a result of the no-slip condition at the wall. The boundary conditions are then aty50 u50 aty5au 50 Since the ﬂow is fully developed, the velocity cannot vary with xand, hence, depends onyonly, so that u5uðyÞ. Furthermore, there is no component of velocity in either theyorzdirection ðv5w50Þ. In fact, for fully developed ﬂow only the pressure can and will change (in a manner to be determined from the analysis) in the xdirection. This is an obvious case for using the Navier /C0Stokes equations in rectangular coordinates (Eqs. 5.27). Using the above assumptions, these equations can be greatlysimpliﬁed and then solved using the boundary conditions (see Problem 8.17). In thissection we will instead take a longer route—using a differential control volume—tobring out some important features of the ﬂuid mechanics. For our analysis we select a differential control volume of size dV---5dx dy dz , and apply the xcomponent of the momentum equation.Cylinder PistonFluid in gap Fig. 8.2 Piston-cylinder approximated as parallel plates.

Equation 4.18athen reduces to the simple result that the sum of the surface forces on the controlvolume is zero, F Sx50 ð8:2Þ The next step is to sum the forces acting on the control volume in the xdirection. We recognize that normal forces (pressure forces) act on the left and right faces andtangential forces (shear forces) act on the top and bottom faces. If the pressure at the center of the element is p, then the pressure force on the left face is dF L5p2@p @xdx 2/C18/C19 dy dz and the pressure force on the right face is dFR52p1@p @xdx 2/C18/C19 dy dz If the shear stress at the center of the element is τyx, then the shear force on the bottom face is dFB52τyx2dτyx dydy 2/C18/C19 dx dz and the shear force on the top face is dFT5τyx1dτyx dydy 2/C18/C19 dx dz Note that in expanding the shear stress, τyx, in a Taylor series about the center of the element, we have used the total derivative rather than a partial derivative. We did thisbecause we recognized that τ yxis only a function of y, since u5uðyÞ. Using the four surface forces dFL,dFR,dFB, and dFTin Eq. 8.2, this equation simpliﬁes to @p @x5dτyx dyð8:3Þ This equation states that because there is no change in momentum, the net pressureforce (which is actually 2@p=@x) balances the net friction force (which is actually 2dτ yx=dy). Equation 8.3 has an interesting feature: The left side is at most a function ofxonly (this follows immediately from writing the ycomponent of the momentum equation); the right side is at most a function of yonly (the ﬂow is fully developed, so334 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous Flowit does not change with x).

Since all stresses were related to velocity gradients through Newton’s law of viscosity, and the additional stresses that arise as a result of turbulent ﬂuctuationshave not been accounted for, all of the results in this section are valid for laminar ﬂow only. Experiments show that laminar ﬂow between stationary parallel plates becomes turbulent for Reynolds numbers (deﬁned as Re5ρ~Va/μ) greater than approximately Consequently, the Reynolds number should be checked after using Eqs. 8.6 toensure a valid solution.1 _ 2 1 _ 2–0 01y'___a u____umaxu_______=a2__ 8μp__ x∂ ∂ –( )xy' yau Fig. 8.4 Dimensionless velocity proﬁle for fully developed laminar ﬂow between inﬁnite parallel plates. Example 8.1 LEAKAGE FLOW PAST A PISTON A hydraulic system operates at a gage pressure of 20 MPa and 55/C14C. The hydraulic ﬂuid is SAE 10W oil. A control valve consists of a piston 25 mm in diameter, ﬁtted to a cylinder with a mean radial clearance of 0.005 mm. Determine the leakage ﬂow rate if the gage pressure on the low-pressure sideof the piston is 1.0 MPa. (The piston is 15 mm long.) Given: Flow of hydraulic oil between piston and cylinder, as shown. Fluid is SAE 10W oil at 55 /C14C. Find: Leakage ﬂow rate, Q. Solution: The gap width is very small, so the ﬂow may be modeled as ﬂow between parallel plates. Equation 8.6c may be applied. Governing equation: Q l5a3Δp 12μLð8:6cÞa = 0.005 mmD = 25 mm p1 = 20 MPa (gage) p2 = 1.0 MPa (gage)L = 15 mm8.2 Fully Developed Laminar Flow Between Inﬁnite Parallel Plates 337Upper Plate Moving with Constant Speed, U The second basic way to generate ﬂow between inﬁnite parallel plates is to have one plate move parallel to the other, either with or without an applied pressure gradient. We will next analyze this problem for the case of laminar ﬂow. Such a ﬂow commonly occurs, for example, in a journal bearing (a commonly used type of bearing, e.g., the main crankshaft bearings in the engine of an automobile). In such a bearing, an inner cylinder, the journal, rotates inside a stationary member. Atlight loads, the centers of the two members essentially coincide, and the smallclearance gap is symmetric. Since the gap is small, it is reasonable to “unfold” thebearing and to model the ﬂow ﬁeld as ﬂow between inﬁnite parallel plates, as indi-cated in the sketch of Fig. 8.5 . Let us now consider a case where the upper plate is moving to the right with constant speed, U. All we have done in going from a stationary upper plate to a moving upper plate is to change one of the boundary conditions. The boundaryconditions for the moving plate case are u50a t y50 u5U at y5aAssumptions: (1) Laminar ﬂow. (2) Steady ﬂow. (3) Incompressible ﬂow. (4) Fully developed ﬂow. (Note L=a515=0:00553000!) The plate width, l, is approximated as l5πD. Thus Q5πDa3Δp 12μL For SAE 10W oil at 55/C14C,μ50:018 kg =ðm/C1sÞ, from Fig. A.2, Appendix A.

From Eq. 8.8, for zero pressure gradient (for @p=@x50) the velocity varies linearly with y. This was the case treated earlier in Chapter 2; this linear proﬁle is called a Couette ﬂow, after a 19th-century physicist. We can obtain additional information about the ﬂow from the velocity distribution of Eq. 8.8.

Equation 8.8 suggests that the velocity proﬁle may be treated as a combination of a linear and a parabolic velocity proﬁle; the last term in Eq. 8.8 is identical to that in Eq. 8.5. The result is a family of velocity proﬁles, depending on Uand (1/ μ)(@p/@x); three proﬁles are sketched in Fig. 8.6 . (As shown in Fig. 8.6, some reverse ﬂow—ﬂow in the negative xdirection—can occur when @p/@x.0.) Again, all of the results developed in this section are valid for laminar ﬂow only. Experiments show that this ﬂow becomes turbulent (for @p/@x50) at a Reynolds number of approximately 1500, where Re5ρUa/μfor this ﬂow case.

To ﬁnish our discussion of this type ofﬂow, Example 8.3 examines a gravity-driven steady, one-dimensional laminar ﬂow down a vertical wall. Once again, the direct approach would be to start with the two-dimensional rectangular coordinate form of the Navier /C0Stokes equations (Eqs. 5.27; see Problem 8.44); instead we will use a differential control volume.The power dissipated in the bearing is _W5FU5FRω5Tω 511:2i n:/C1lbf33600rev min3min 60 s32πrad rev3ft 12 in :3hp/C1s 550 ft /C1lbf _W50:640 hp ß_W To ensure laminar ﬂow, check the Reynolds number.

Example 8.3 LAMINAR FILM ON A VERTICAL WALL A viscous, incompressible, Newtonian liquid ﬂows in steady, laminar ﬂow down a vertical wall. The thickness, δ,o f the liquid ﬁlm is constant.

The only surface forces acting on the differential control volume are shear forces on the vertical surfaces.

Thus on the left face, a minus ysurface, τyxLacts upward, and on the right face, a plus ysurface, τyxRacts downward.

Here the ﬂow is axisymmetric. Consequently it is most convenient to work in cylindrical coordinates. This is yet another case where we could use the Navier /C0Stokes equations, this time in cylindrical coordinates (Eqs. B.3). Instead we will again take the longer route—using a differential control volume—to bring out some important featuresof the ﬂuid mechanics. The development will be very similar to that for parallel plates inthe previous section; cylindrical coordinates just make the analysis a little trickiermathematically. Since the ﬂow is axisymmetric, the control volume will be a differentialannulus, as shown in Fig. 8.7 . The control volume length is dxand its thickness is dr. For a fully developed steady ﬂow, the xcomponent of the momentum equation (Eq. 4.18a), when applied to the differential control volume, once again reduces to F Sx50 The next step is to sum the forces acting on the control volume in the xdirection. We know that normal forces (pressure forces) act on the left and right ends of the controlvolume, and that tangential forces (shear forces) act on the inner and outer cylindricalsurfaces.From boundary condition (ii), 0 52ρg μδ1c1orc15ρg μδ Hence, u52ρg μy2 21ρg μδyoru5ρg μδ2y δ/C16/C17 21 2y δ/C16/C172/C20/C21 ßuðyÞ Using the velocity proﬁle it can be shown that: the volume flow rate is Q=l5ρg 3μδ3 the maximum velocity is Umax5ρg 2μδ2 the average velocity is V5ρg 3μδ2 Flow in the liquid ﬁlm is laminar for Re5Vδ=ν#1000 ½1/C138:Notes: üThisprob lemis aspec ialcase(θ590/C14)oftheinclinedplateﬂowanalyzedinExample5.9that wesolvedusingtheNavier/C0Stok esequa tions.üThis problemand Example5.9demonstratethat useofthediffer-entialcontrolvolumeapproachortheNavier/C0Stokesequationsleadstothesameresult.

If we ignore friction for a moment (and assume steady ﬂow and consider a streamline in the ﬂow), the Bernoulli equation from Chapter 6 applies, p ρ1V2 21gz5constant ð6:8Þ From this equation we can see what tends to lead to a pressure decrease along the streamline in this frictionless ﬂow: a reduction of area at some point in the pipe (causing an increase in the velocity V), or the pipe having a positive incline (so zincreases). Conversely, the pressure will tend to increase if the ﬂow area is increased or the pipe slopes downward. We say “tends to” because one factor may counteractanother; for example, we may have a downward sloping pipe (tending to increasepressure) with a reduction in diameter (tending to decrease pressure).Given: Flow in a capillary viscometer.

We will learn that, in effect, friction effects lead to a continual reduction in the valueof the Bernoulli constant of Eq. 6.8 (this represents a “loss” of mechanical energy).We have already seen that, in contrast to the Bernoulli equation, for laminar ﬂowthere is a pressure drop even for a horizontal, constant diameter pipe; in this sectionwe will see that turbulent ﬂows experience an even larger pressure drop. We will needto replace the Bernoulli equation with an energy equation that incorporates theeffects of friction. In summary, we can state that three factors tend to reduce the pressure in a pipe ﬂow: a decrease in pipe area, an upward slope, and friction. For now we will focus onpressure loss due to friction and so will analyze pipes that are of constant area and thatare horizontal. We have already seen in the previous section that for laminar ﬂow we can theo- retically deduce the pressure drop. Rearranging Eq. 8.13c to solve for the pressuredropΔp, Δp5 128μLQ πD4 We would like to develop a similar expression that applies for turbulent ﬂows, but wewill see that this is not possible analytically; instead, we will develop expressions based on a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches. Before proceeding, we note that it is conventional to break losses due to friction into two categories: major losses , which are losses due to friction in the constant-area sections of the pipe; and minor losses (sometimes larger than “major” losses), which are losses due to valves, elbows, and so on (and we will treat the pressure drop at the entrance region as aminor loss term). Since circular pipes are most common in engineering applications, the basic anal- ysis will be performed for circular geometries. The results can be extended to other geometries by introducing the hydraulic diameter, which is treated in Section 8.7 . (Open channel ﬂows will be treated in Chapter 11, and compressible ﬂow in ducts will be treated in Chapter 13.) 8.4 Shear Stress Distribution in Fully Developed Pipe Flow We consider again fully developed ﬂow in a horizontal circular pipe, except now wemay have laminar or turbulent ﬂow. In Section 8.3 we showed that a force balance between friction and pressure forces leads to Eq. 8.10: τ rx5r 2@p @x/C18/C19 1c1 rð8:10Þ Because we cannot have inﬁnite stress at the centerline, the constant of integration c1 must be zero, so τrx5r 2@p @xð8:15Þ Equation 8.15 indicates that for both laminar and turbulent fully developed ﬂows the shear stress varies linearly across the pipe, from zero at the centerline to a maximum at8.4 Shear Stress Distribution in Fully Developed Pipe Flow 349the pipe wall. The stress on the wall, τw(equal and opposite to the stress in the ﬂuid at the wall), is given by τw52τrx½/C138r5R52R 2@p @xð8:16Þ Forlaminar ﬂow we used our familiar stress equation τrx5μdu/drin Eq. 8.15 to eventually obtain the laminar velocity distribution. This led to a set of usable equa- tions, Eqs. 8.13, for obtaining various ﬂow characteristics; e.g., Eq. 8.13c gave a relationship for the ﬂow rate Q, a result ﬁrst obtained experimentally by Jean Louis Poiseuille, a French physician, and independently by Gotthilf H. L. Hagen, a German engineer, in the 1850s [2]. Unfortunately there is no equivalent stress equation for turbulent ﬂow, so we cannot replicate the laminar ﬂow analysis to derive turbulent equivalents of Eqs. 8.13.All we can do in this section is indicate some classic semi-empirical results [3]. As we discussed in Section 2.6, and illustrated in Fig. 2.17, turbulent ﬂow is repre- sented at each point by the time-mean velocity uplus (for a two-dimensional ﬂow) randomly ﬂuctuating velocity components uuand vuin the xandydirections (in this context yis the distance inwards from the pipe wall). These components continuously transfer momentum between adjacent ﬂuid layers, tending to reduce any velocitygradient present. This effect shows up as an apparent stress, ﬁrst introduced byOsborne Reynolds, and called the Reynolds stress . 1This stress is given by 2ρuuvu, where the overbar indicates a time average. Hence, we ﬁnd τ5τlam1τturb5μdu dy2ρuuvu ð8:17Þ Do not misunderstand the minus sign in Eq. 8.17—it turns out that uuand vuare negatively correlated, so that τturb52ρuuvuis positive. In Fig. 8.8 , experimental measurements of the Reynolds stress for fully developed turbulent pipe ﬂow at twoReynolds numbers are presented; Re U5UD=ν, where Uis the centerline velocity. The turbulent shear stress has been nondimensionalized with the wall shear stress.Recall that Eq. 8.15 showed that the shear stress in the ﬂuid varies linearly from τ w at the pipe wall ( y/R-0) to zero at the centerline ( y/R51); from Fig. 8.8 we see that the Reynolds stress has almost the same trend, so that the friction is almost all due toReynolds stress. What Fig. 8.8 doesn’t show is that close to the wall ( y/R-0) the Reynolds stress drops to zero. This is because the no-slip condition holds, so not ReU 500,000 50,000 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 Dimensionless distance from wall, 0.2 000.20.40.60.81.0 ____ – u'v'_____ τw ρ y_ _ _ R Fig. 8.8 Turbulent shear stress (Reynolds stress) for fully developed turbulent ﬂow in a pipe.

Hence, the turbulent stress, τturb52ρuuvu-0, as we approach the wall, and is zero at the wall. Since the Reynolds stress is zero at the wall, Eq. 8.17 shows that the wall shear is given by τw5μðdu=dyÞy50. In the region very close to the wall, called the wall layer , viscous shear is dominant. In the region between the wall layer and the central portion of thepipe both viscous and turbulent shear are important. 8.5 Turbulent Velocity Pro ﬁles in Fully Developed Pipe Flow Except for ﬂows of very viscous ﬂuids in small diameter ducts, internal ﬂows generallyare turbulent. As noted in the discussion of shear stress distribution in fully developedpipe ﬂow (Section 8.4 ), in turbulent ﬂow there is no universal relationship between the stress ﬁeld and the mean velocity ﬁeld. Thus, for turbulent ﬂows we are forced to relyon experimental data. Dividing Eq. 8.17 by ρgives τ ρ5νdu dy2uuvu ð8:18Þ The term τ/ρarises frequently in the consideration of turbulent ﬂows; it has dimen- sions of velocity squared. In particular, the quantity ðτw=ρÞ1=2is called the friction velocity and is denoted by the symbol u*. It is a constant for a given ﬂow. The velocity proﬁle for fully developed turbulent ﬂow through a smooth pipe is shown in Fig. 8.9 . The plot is semilogarithmic; u=u*is plotted against log( yu*=ν). The nondimensional parameters u=u*andyu*=νarise from dimensional analysis if one reasons that the velocity in the neighborhood of the wall is determined by the con-ditions at the wall, the ﬂuid properties, and the distance from the wall. It is simply fortuitous that the dimensionless plot of Fig. 8.9 gives a fairly accurate representation of the velocity proﬁle in a pipe away from the wall; note the small deviations in theregion of the pipe centerline.

VIDEO The Glen Canyon Dam: A Turbulent Pipe Flow. 8.5 Turbulent Velocity Proﬁles in Fully Developed Pipe Flow 351In the region very close to the wall where viscous shear is dominant, the mean velocity proﬁle follows the linear viscous relation u15u u*5yu* ν5y1ð8:19Þ where yis distance measured from the wall ( y5R2r;Ris the pipe radius), and uis mean velocity. Equation 8.19 is valid for 0 #y1#5/C07; this region is called the viscous sublayer . For values of yu*=ν.30, the data are quite well represented by the semiloga- rithmic curve-ﬁt equation u u*52:5l nyu* ν15:0 ð8:20Þ In this region both viscous and turbulent shear are important (although turbulent shear is expected to be signiﬁcantly larger). There is considerable scatter in the numerical constants of Eq. 8.20; the values given represent averages over many experiments [6]. The region between y15527a n d y1530 is referred to as the transition region ,o rbuffer layer . If Eq. 8.20 is evaluated at the centerline ( y5Rand u5U) and the general expression of Eq. 8.20 is subtracted from the equation evaluated at the centerline, weobtain U2u u*52:5l nR yð8:21Þ where Uis the centerline velocity. Equation 8.21, referred to as the defect law , shows that the velocity defect (and hence the general shape of the velocity proﬁle in the neighborhood of the centerline) is a function of the distance ratio only and does not depend on the viscosity of the ﬂuid. The velocity proﬁle for turbulent ﬂow through a smooth pipe may also be approximated by the empirical power-law equation u U5y R/C16/C171=n 512r R/C16/C171=n ð8:22Þ where the exponent, n, varies with the Reynolds number. In Fig. 8.10 the data of Laufer [5] are shown on a plot of ln y/Rversus ln u=U. If the power-law proﬁle were an accurate representation of the data, all data points would fall on a straight line ofslope n. Clearly the data for Re U553104deviate from the best-ﬁt straight line in the neighborhood of the wall. Hence the power-law proﬁle is not applicable close to the wall ( y=R,0:04). Since the velocity is low in this region, the error in calculating integral quantities such as mass, momentum, and energy ﬂuxes at a section is relatively small. The power-law proﬁle gives an inﬁnite velocity gradient at the wall and hence cannot be used incalculations of wall shear stress. Although the proﬁle ﬁts the data close to the cen-terline, it fails to give zero slope there. Despite these shortcomings, the power-lawproﬁle is found to give adequate results in many calculations. Data from Hinze [7] suggest that the variation of power-law exponent nwith Reynolds number (based on pipe diameter, D, and centerline velocity, U) for fully developed ﬂow in smooth pipes is given by n521:711:8 log Re U ð8:23Þ forReU.23104.

VIDEO Computer Simulation: Turbulent Channel Flow 3. 352 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous FlowSince the average velocity is V5Q=A, and Q5Z A~V/C1d~A the ratio of the average velocity to the centerline velocity may be calculated for the power-law proﬁles of Eq. 8.22 assuming the proﬁles to be valid from wall to centerline.The result is V U52n2 ðn11Þð2n11Þð8:24Þ From Eq. 8.24, we see that as nincreases (with increasing Reynolds number) the ratio of the average velocity to the centerline velocity increases; with increasing Reynoldsnumber the velocity proﬁle becomes more blunt or “fuller” (for n56; V=U50:79 and for n510;V=U50:87). As a representative value, 7 often is used for the exponent; this gives rise to the term “a one-seventh power proﬁle” for fully developedturbulent ﬂow: u U5y R/C16/C171=7 512r R/C16/C171=7 Velocity proﬁles for n56 and n510 are shown in Fig. 8.11 . The parabolic proﬁle for fully developed laminar ﬂow is included for comparison. It is clear that the turbulentproﬁle has a much steeper slope near the wall. This is consistent with our discussionleading to Eq. 8.17—the ﬂuctuating velocity components uuand vucontinuously transfer momentum between adjacent ﬂuid layers, tending to reduce the velocitygradient. 8.6 Energy Considerations in Pipe Flow We have so far used the momentum and conservation of mass equations, in controlvolume form, to discuss viscous ﬂow.

In Section 6.5 we discussed the Energy Grade Line (EGL), EGL5p ρg1V2 2g1z ð6:16bÞ and saw that this is a measure of the total mechanical energy (“pressure,” kinetic andpotential, per unit mass) in a ﬂow. We can expect that instead of being constant(which it was for inviscid ﬂow), the EGL will continuously decrease in the direction ofﬂow as friction “eats” the mechanical energy (Examples 8.9 and 8.10 have sketchesof such EGL—and HGL—curves; you may wish to preview them). We can nowconsider the energy equation (the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics) to obtain informationon the effects of friction. Consider, for example, steady ﬂow through the piping system, including a reducing elbow, shown in Fig. 8.12 . The control volume boundaries are shown as dashed lines. They are normal to the ﬂow at sections 1and 2and coincide with the inside surface of the pipe wall elsewhere.

However, it is convenient to introduce the average velocity into Eq. 8.25 so that wecan eliminate the integrals. To do this, we deﬁne a kinetic energy coefﬁcient. Kinetic Energy Coefﬁcient Thekinetic energy coefﬁcient ,α, is deﬁned such that Z AV2 2ρVd A5αZ AV2 2ρVdA5α/C1mV2 2ð8:26aÞ or α5Z AρV3dA /C1mV2ð8:26bÞ We can think of αas a correction factor that allows us to use the average velocity Vin the energy equation to compute the kinetic energy at a cross section. For laminar ﬂow in a pipe (velocity proﬁle given by Eq. 8.12), α52:0. In turbulent pipe ﬂow, the velocity proﬁle is quite ﬂat, as shown in Fig. 8.11 . We can use Eq. 8.26b together with Eqs. 8.22 and 8.24 to determine α. Substituting the power- law velocity proﬁle of Eq. 8.22 into Eq. 8.26b, we obtain α5U V/C18/C1932n2 ð31nÞð312nÞð8:27Þ Equation 8.24 gives V=Uas a function of the power-law exponent n; combining this with Eq. 8.27 leads to a fairly complicated expression in n. The overall result is that in the realistic range of n, from n56t on510 for high Reynolds numbers, αvaries from 1.08 to 1.03; for the one-seventh power proﬁle ( n57),α51.06. Because αis rea- sonably close to unity for high Reynolds numbers, and because the change in kineticenergy is usually small compared with the dominant terms in the energy equation, we shall almost always use the approximation α51in our pipe ﬂow calculations . Head Loss Using the deﬁnition of α, the energy equation (Eq. 8.25) can be written _Q5/C1mðu22u1Þ1/C1mp2 ρ2p1 ρ/C18/C19 1/C1mgðz22z1Þ1/C1mα2V2 2 22α1V21 2 !8.6 Energy Considerations in Pipe Flow 355Dividing by the mass ﬂow rate gives δQ dm5u22u11p2 ρ2p1 ρ1gz22gz11α2V2 2 22α1V21 2 Rearranging this equation, we write p1 ρ1α1V2 1 21gz1 ! 2p2 ρ1α2V22 21gz2 ! 5ðu22u1Þ2δQ dmð8:28Þ In Eq. 8.28, the term p ρ1αV2 21gz ! represents the mechanical energy per unit mass at a cross section. (Compare it to the EGL expression, Eq. 6.16b, for computing “mechanical” energy, which we discussed at the beginning of this section. The differences are that in the EGL we divide by gto obtain the EGL in units of feet or meters, and here αV2allows for the fact that in a pipe ﬂow we have a velocity proﬁle, not a uniform ﬂow.) The term u22u12δQ=dmis equal to the difference in mechanical energy per unit mass between sections 1and It represents the (irreversible) conversion of mechanical energy at section 1to unwanted thermal energy ( u22u1) and loss of energy via heat transfer ð2δQ=dmÞ.W e identify this group of terms as the total energy loss per unit mass and designate it by the symbol hlT.

Equation 8.29 is one of the most important and useful equations in ﬂuid mechanics. It enables us to compute the loss of mechanical energy caused by friction between twosections of a pipe. We recall our discussion at the beginning of Part B, where we dis-cussed what would cause the pressure to change. We hypothesized a frictionless ﬂow(i.e., described by the Bernoulli equation, or Eq. 8.29 with α51 and h lT50) so that the pressure could only change if the velocity changed (if the pipe had a change in diameter), or if the potential changed (if the pipe was not horizontal). Now, with friction, Eq. 8.29 indicates that the pressure will change even for a constant-areahorizontal pipe—mechanical energy will be continuously changed into thermal energy. As the empirical science of hydraulics developed during the 19th century, it was common practice to express the energy balance in terms of energy per unit weight of ﬂowing liquid (e.g., water) rather than energy per unit mass , as in Eq. 8.29. When Eq. 8.29 is divided by the acceleration of gravity, g, we obtain p1 ρg1α1V2 1 2g1z1 ! 2p2 ρg1α2V22 2g1z2 ! 5hlT g5HlTð8:30Þ Each term in Eq. 8.30 has dimensions of energy per unit weight of ﬂowing ﬂuid. Then the net dimensions of HlT5hlT=gareðL2=t2Þðt2=LÞ5L, or feet of ﬂowing liquid. Since the term head loss is in common use, we shall use it when referring to either HlT (with dimensions of energy per unit weight or length) or hlT5gHlT(with dimensions of energy per unit mass). Equation 8.29 (or Eq. 8.30) can be used to calculate the pressure difference between any two points in a piping system, provided the head loss, hlT(orHlT), can be determined. We shall consider calculation of head loss in the next section.356 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous Flow8.7 Calculation of Head Loss Total head loss, hlT, is regarded as the sum of major losses, hl, due to frictional effects in fully developed ﬂow in constant-area tubes, and minor losses, hlm, resulting from entrances, ﬁttings, area changes, and so on. Consequently, we consider the major and minor losses separately. Major Losses: Friction Factor The energy balance, expressed by Eq. 8.29, can be used to evaluate the major headloss. For fully developed ﬂow through a constant-area pipe, h lm50, and α1ðV2 1=2Þ5α2ðV22=2Þ; Eq. 8.29 reduces to p12p2 ρ5gðz22z1Þ1hl ð8:31Þ If the pipe is horizontal, then z25z1and p12p2 ρ5Δp ρ5hl ð8:32Þ Thus the major head loss can be expressed as the pressure loss for fully developed ﬂow through a horizontal pipe of constant area. Since head loss represents the energy converted by frictional effects from mechanical to thermal energy, head loss for fully developed ﬂow in a constant-area duct depends only on the details of the ﬂow through the duct. Head loss is inde- pendent of pipe orientation. a. Laminar Flow In laminar ﬂow, we saw in Section 8.3 that the pressure drop may be computed analytically for fully developed ﬂow in a horizontal pipe.

Turbulent Flow In turbulent ﬂow we cannot evaluate the pressure drop analytically; we must resort toexperimental results and use dimensional analysis to correlate the experimental data.In fully developed turbulent ﬂow, the pressure drop, Δp, caused by friction in a horizontal constant-area pipe is known to depend on pipe diameter, D, pipe length, L, pipe roughness, e, average ﬂow velocity, V, ﬂuid density, ρ, and ﬂuid viscosity, μ.I n functional form Δp5ΔpðD;L;e;V;ρ;μÞ We applied dimensional analysis to this problem in Example 7.2.

The results, published by L. F. Moody [8], are shown in Fig. 8.13. To determine head loss for fully developed ﬂow with known conditions, the Rey- nolds number is evaluated ﬁrst. Roughness, e, is obtained from Table 8.1 . Then the friction factor, f, can be read from the appropriate curve in Fig. 8.13, at the known values of Reande/D. Finally, head loss can be found using Eq. 8.34 or Eq. 8.35. 2The friction factor deﬁned by Eq. 8.34 is the Darcy friction factor .

Although we took no notice of roughness in derivingEq. 8.33, experimental results verify that the friction factor is a function only ofReynolds number in laminar ﬂow. The Reynolds number in a pipe may be changed most easily by varying the average ﬂow velocity. If the ﬂow in a pipe is originally laminar, increasing the velocity until thecritical Reynolds number is reached causes transition to occur; the laminar ﬂow givesway to turbulent ﬂow. The effect of transition on the velocity proﬁle was discussed in Section 8.5 . Figure 8.11 shows that the velocity gradient at the tube wall is much larger for turbulent ﬂow than for laminar ﬂow. This change in velocity proﬁle causes the wall shear stress to increase sharply, with the same effect on the friction factor. As the Reynolds number is increased above the transition value, the velocity proﬁle continues to become fuller, as noted in Section 8.5 . For values of relative roughness e/D#0.001, the friction factor at ﬁrst tends to follow the smooth pipe curve, along which friction factor is a function of Reynolds number only. However, as the Reynolds number increases, the velocity proﬁle becomes still fuller. The size of the thin viscous sublayer near the tube wall decreases. As roughness elements begin to poke through this layer, the effect of roughness becomes important, and the frictionfactor becomes a function of both the Reynolds number andthe relative roughness. At very large Reynolds number, most of the roughness elements on the tube wall protrude through the viscous sublayer; the drag and, hence, the pressure loss, dependonly on the size of the roughness elements. This is termed the “fully rough” ﬂowregime; the friction factor depends only on e/Din this regime. For values of relative roughness e=D$0:001, as the Reynolds number is increased above the transition value, the friction factor is greater than the smooth pipe value. Aswas the case for lower values of e/D, the value of Reynolds number at which the ﬂow regime becomes fully rough decreases with increasing relative roughness. To summarize the preceding discussion, we see that as Reynolds number is increased, the friction factor decreases as long as the ﬂow remains laminar. At tran-sition, fincreases sharply. In the turbulent ﬂow regime, the friction factor decreases gradually and ﬁnally levels out at a constant value for large Reynolds number. Bear in mind that the actual loss of energy is h l(Eq. 8.34), which is proportional to f and V2. Hence, for laminar ﬂow hl~V(because f564=Re, and Re~V); for the transition region there is a sudden increase in hl; for the fully rough zone hl~V2 (because f/C25const.), and for the rest of the turbulent region hlincreases at a rate somewhere between VandV2. We conclude that the head loss always increases with ﬂow rate, and more rapidly when the ﬂow is turbulent. To avoid having to use a graphical method for obtaining ffor turbulent ﬂows, various mathematical expressions have been ﬁtted to the data. The most widely usedformula for friction factor is from Colebrook [9], 1ﬃﬃﬃ fp522:0 loge=D 3:712:51 Reﬃﬃﬃfp ! ð8:37Þ Equation 8.37 is implicit in f, but these days most scientiﬁc calculators have an equation-solving feature that can be easily used to ﬁnd ffor a given roughness ratio e/D and Reynolds number Re(and some calculators have the Colebrook equation itself built in!). Certainly a spreadsheet such as Excel, or other mathematical computer360 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous Flowapplications, can also be used (there is an Excel add-in for computing ffor laminar and turbulent ﬂows available on the Web site). Even without using these automated approaches, Eq. 8.37 is not difﬁcult to solve for f—all we need to do is iterate. Equation 8.37 is quite stable—almost any initial guess value for fin the right side will, after very few iterations, lead to a converged value for fto three signiﬁcant ﬁgures. From Fig. 8.13 , we can see that for turbulent ﬂows f,0.1; hence f50.1 would make a good initial value. Another strategy is to use Fig. 8.13 to obtain a good ﬁrst estimate;then usually one iteration using Eq. 8.37 yields a good value for f. As an alternative, Haaland [10] developed the following equation, 1ﬃﬃﬃ fp521:8 loge=D 3:7/C18/C191:11 16:9 Re"# as an approximation to the Colebrook equation; for Re.3000, it gives results within about 2 percent of the Colebrook equation, without the need to iterate. For turbulent ﬂow in smooth pipes, the Blasius correlation, valid for Re#l05,i s f50:316 Re0:25ð8:38Þ When this relation is combined with the expression for wall shear stress (Eq. 8.16), the expression for head loss (Eq. 8.32), and the deﬁnition of friction factor (Eq. 8.34), auseful expression for the wall shear stress is obtained as τ w50:0332ρV2ν RV/C18/C190:25 ð8:39Þ This equation will be used later in our study of turbulent boundary-layer ﬂow over a ﬂat plate (Chapter 9). All of the evalues given in Table 8.1 are for new pipes, in relatively good condition. Over long periods of service, corrosion takes place and, particularly in hard water areas, lime deposits and rust scale form on pipe walls. Corrosion can weaken pipes,eventually leading to failure. Deposit formation increases wall roughness appreciably,and also decreases the effective diameter. These factors combine to cause e/Dto increase by factors of 5 to 10 for old pipes (see Problem 10.63). An example is shownin Fig. 8.14. Curves presented in Fig. 8.13 represent average values for data obtained from numerous experiments. The curves should be considered accurate within approxi-mately 610 percent, which is sufﬁcient for many engineering analyses. If more accuracy is needed, actual test data should be used. Minor Losses The ﬂow in a piping system may be required to pass through a variety of ﬁttings,bends, or abrupt changes in area. Additional head losses are encountered, primarily asa result of ﬂow separation. (Energy eventually is dissipated by violent mixing inthe separated zones.) These losses will be minor (hence the term minor losses ) if the piping system includes long lengths of constant-area pipe. Depending on the device,minor losses traditionally are computed in one of two ways, either hlm5KV2 2ð8:40aÞ8.7Calculation of Head Loss 361where the loss coefﬁcient ,K, must be determined experimentally for each situation, or hlm5fLe DV2 2ð8:40bÞ where Leis an equivalent length of straight pipe. For ﬂow through pipe bends and ﬁttings, the loss coefﬁcient, K, is found to vary with pipe size (diameter) in much the same manner as the friction factor, f, for ﬂow through a straight pipe. Consequently, the equivalent length, Le/D, tends toward a constant for different sizes of a given type of ﬁtting. Experimental data for minor losses are plentiful, but they are scattered among a variety of sources. Different sources may give different values for the same ﬂow conﬁguration. The data presented here should be considered as representative forsome commonly encountered situations; in each case the source of the data isidentiﬁed. a. Inlets and Exits A poorly designed inlet to a pipe can cause appreciable head loss. If the inlet hassharp corners, ﬂow separation occurs at the corners, and a vena contracta is formed. The ﬂuid must accelerate locally to pass through the reduced ﬂow area at the venacontracta. Losses in mechanical energy result from the unconﬁned mixing as the ﬂowstream decelerates again to ﬁll the pipe. Three basic inlet geometries are shown inTable 8.2 . From the table it is clear that the loss coefﬁcient is reduced signiﬁcantly when the inlet is rounded even slightly. For a well-rounded inlet ( r=D$0:15) the entrance loss coefﬁcient is almost negligible. Example 8.9 illustrates a procedure forexperimentally determining the loss coefﬁcient for a pipe inlet. The kinetic energy per unit mass, α V2=2, is completely dissipated by mixing when ﬂow discharges from a duct into a large reservoir or plenum chamber. The situationcorresponds to ﬂow through an abrupt expansion with AR50 (Fig. 8.15 ). The minor loss coefﬁcient thus equals α, which as we saw in the previous section we usually set Fig. 8.14 Pipe section removed after 40 years of service as a water line, showing formation of scale.

No improvement in minor loss coefﬁcient for an exit is possible; however, addition of a diffuser can reduce V2=2 and therefore hlmconsiderably (see Example 8.10). b. Enlargements and Contractions Minor loss coefﬁcients for sudden expansions and contractions in circular ducts aregiven in Fig. 8.15 . Note that both loss coefﬁcients are based on the larger V2/2. Thus losses for a sudden expansion are based on V2 1=2, and those for a contraction are based onV22=2. Losses caused by area change can be reduced somewhat by installing a nozzle or diffuser between the two sections of straight pipe. Data for nozzles are given in Table 8.3 . Note that the ﬁnal column (data for the included angle θ5180/C14) agrees with the data of Fig. 8.15. Losses in diffusers depend on a number of geometric and ﬂow variables. Diffuser data most commonly are presented in terms of a pressure recovery coefﬁcient, Cp, deﬁned as the ratio of static pressure rise to inlet dynamic pressure, Cp/C17p22p1 1 2ρV2 1ð8:41ÞTable 8.2 Minor Loss Coefﬁcients for Pipe Entrances Entrance Type Minor Loss Coefﬁcient, Ka rDReentrant Square-edged Rounded0.78 0.5 r=D 0:02 0:06 $0:15 K 0:28 0:15 0:04 aBased on hlm5K(V2/2), where Vis the mean velocity in the pipe.

(Data from Streeter [1].)8.7Calculation of Head Loss 363This shows what fraction of the inlet kinetic energy shows up as a pressure rise. It is not difﬁcult to show (using the Bernoulli and continuity equations; see Problem 8.201) that the ideal (frictionless) pressure recovery coefﬁcient is given by Cpi5121 AR2ð8:42Þ where ARis the area ratio. Hence, the ideal pressure recovery coefﬁcient is a function only of the area ratio. In reality a diffuser typically has turbulent ﬂow, and the staticpressure rise in the direction of ﬂow may cause ﬂow separation from the walls if the diffuser is poorly designed; ﬂow pulsations can even occur. For these reasons the actual C pwill be somewhat less than indicated by Eq. 8.42. For example, data for conical diffusers with fully developed turbulent pipe ﬂow at the inlet are presented in Fig. 8.16 as a function of geometry. Note that more tapered diffusers (small diver- gence angle φor large dimensionless length N/R1) are more likely to approach the ideal constant value for Cp. As we make the cone shorter, for a given ﬁxed area ratio we start to see a drop in Cp—we can consider the cone length at which this starts to happen the optimum length (it is the shortest length for which we obtain the max-imum coefﬁcient for a given area ratio—closest to that predicted by Eq. 8.42). We canrelate C pto the head loss.

We can combine Eqs. 8.42 and 8.43 to obtain an expression for the head loss in terms of the actual and ideal Cpvalues: hlm5ðCpi2CpÞV2 1 2ð8:44Þ Performance maps for plane wall and annular diffusers [14] and for radial diffusers [15] are available in the literature. Diffuser pressure recovery is essentially independent of Reynolds number for inlet Reynolds numbers greater than 7.5 3104[16]. Diffuser pressure recovery with uni- form inlet ﬂow is somewhat better than that for fully developed inlet ﬂow. Perfor- mance maps for plane wall, conical, and annular diffusers for a variety of inlet ﬂow conditions are presented in [17]. Since static pressure rises in the direction of ﬂow in a diffuser, ﬂow may separate from the walls. For some geometries, the outlet ﬂow is distorted. For wide angle dif- fusers, vanes or splitters can be used to suppress stall and improve pressurerecovery [18]. c. Pipe Bends The head loss of a bend is larger than for fully developed ﬂow through a straightsection of equal length. The additional loss is primarily the result of secondary ﬂow,and is represented most conveniently by an equivalent length of straight pipe. Theequivalent length depends on the relative radius of curvature of the bend, as shown inFlowR1 N p1 p2φφ AR = (1 + tan )2 N___ R14.0 3.0 2.0 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.3 1.2 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 3.0 5.0 10.0 8.0 4.0 0.8 Dimensionless length, N/R14 6 8 12 1416180.300.40 0.300.35 0.40 0.450.500.600.70 Cp = 0.35 Cp2 = 5 degreesφ2 = 15 degreesφ2 = 20 degreesφ φ2 = 10 degrees468 12Area ratio, AR = A2/A1 Fig. 8.16 Pressure recovery for conical diffusers with fully developed turbulent pipe ﬂow at inlet.

An approximate procedure for computing the resistance of bends with other turning angles is given in [11]. Because they are simple and inexpensive to construct in the ﬁeld, miter bends often are used in large pipe systems. Design data for miter bends are given in Fig. 8.17 b. Note that you get what you pay for: From Fig. 8.17a the equivalent length for pipe bends varies from about 10 to about 40 diameters; for the cheaper 90/C14miter bend of Fig. 8.17b we get a much larger equivalent length of 60 diameters. d. Valves and Fittings Losses for ﬂow through valves and ﬁttings also may be expressed in terms of an equivalent length of straight pipe. Some representative data are given in Table 8.4 . All resistances are given for fully open valves; losses increase markedly when valves are partially open.

Source: Data from Reference [11].366 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous FlowWhenever possible, resistances furnished by the valve supplier should be used if accurate results are needed. Fittings in a piping system may have threaded, ﬂanged, or welded connections. For small diameters, threaded joints are most common; large pipe systems frequently haveﬂanged or welded joints. In practice, insertion losses for ﬁttings and valves vary considerably, depending on the care used in fabricating the pipe system. If burrs from cutting pipe sections areallowed to remain, they cause local ﬂow obstructions, which increase lossesappreciably. Although the losses discussed in this section were termed “minor losses,” they can be a large fraction of the overall system loss. Thus a system for which calculations are to be made must be checked carefully to make sure all losses have been identiﬁed and their magnitudes estimated. If calculations are made carefully, the results will be ofsatisfactory engineering accuracy. You may expect to predict actual losses within610 percent. We include here one more device that changes the energy of the ﬂuid—except this time the energy of the ﬂuid will be increased, so it creates a “negative energy loss.” Pumps, Fans, and Blowers in Fluid Systems In many practical ﬂow situations (e.g., the cooling system of an automobile engine, theHVAC system of a building), the driving force for maintaining the ﬂow against fric-tion is a pump (for liquids) or a fan or blower (for gases). Here we will considerpumps, although all the results apply equally to fans and blowers. We generallyneglect heat transfer and internal energy changes of the ﬂuid (we will incorporatethem later into the deﬁnition of the pump efﬁciency), so the ﬁrst law of thermo- dynamics applied across the pump is _W pump5/C1mp ρ1V2 21gz ! discharge2p ρ1V2 21gz ! suction2 435 We can also compute the head Δh pump (energy/mass) produced by the pump, Δhpump5_Wpump /C1m5p ρ1V2 21gz ! discharge2p ρ1V2 21gz ! suctionð8:45Þ In many cases the inlet and outlet diameters (and therefore velocities) and elevations are the same or negligibly different, so Eq. 8.45 simpliﬁes to Δhpump5Δppump ρð8:46Þ It is interesting to note that a pump adds energy to the ﬂuid in the form of a gain inpressure—the everyday, invalid perception is that pumps add kinetic energy to theﬂuid. (It istrue that when a pump-pipe system is ﬁrst started up, the pump does work to accelerate the ﬂuid to its steady speed; this is when a pump driven by an electric motor is most in danger of burning out the motor.) The idea is that in a pump-pipe system the head produced by the pump (Eq. 8.45 or 8.46) is needed to overcome the head loss for the pipe system. Hence, the ﬂow rate in such a system depends on the pump characteristics and the major and minor losses ofthe pipe system. We will learn in Chapter 10 that the head produced by a given pumpis not constant, but varies with ﬂow rate through the pump, leading to the notion of“matching” a pump to a given system to achieve the desired ﬂow rate.8.7Calculation of Head Loss 367A useful relation is obtained from Eq. 8.46 if we multiply by/C1m5ρQ(Qis the ﬂow rate) and recall that/C1mΔhpump is the power supplied to the ﬂuid, _Wpump5QΔppump ð8:47Þ We can also deﬁne the pump efﬁciency: η5_Wpump _Winð8:48Þ where _Wpump is the power reaching the ﬂuid, and _Winis the power input (usually electrical) to the pump. We note that, when applying the energy equation (Eq. 8.29) to a pipe system, we may sometimes choose points 1 and 2 so that a pump is included in the system. For these cases we can simply include the head of the pump as a “negative loss”: p1 ρ1α1V2 1 21gz1 ! 2p2 ρ1α2V22 21gz2 ! 5hlT2Δhpump ð8:49Þ Noncircular Ducts The empirical correlations for pipe ﬂow also may be used for computations involving noncircular ducts, provided their cross sections are not too exaggerated. Thus ducts ofsquare or rectangular cross section may be treated if the ratio of height to width is less than about 3 or 4. The correlations for turbulent pipe ﬂow are extended for use with noncircular geometries by introducing the hydraulic diameter , deﬁned as Dh/C174A Pð8:50Þ in place of the diameter, D. In Eq. 8.50, Ais cross-sectional area, and Piswetted perimeter , the length of wall in contact with the ﬂowing ﬂuid at any cross-section. The factor 4 is introduced so that the hydraulic diameter will equal the duct diameter for a circular cross section.

For a square duct, ar51a n d Dh5h. As noted, the hydraulic diameter concept can be applied in the approximate range 1 4,ar,4. Under these conditions, the correlations for pipe ﬂow give acceptably accurate results for rectangular ducts. Since such ducts are easy and cheap to fabricate368 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous Flowfrom sheet metal, they are commonly used in air conditioning, heating, and ventilating applications. Extensive data on losses for air ﬂow are available (e.g., see [12, 19]). Losses caused by secondary ﬂows increase rapidly for more extreme geometries, so the correlations are not applicable to wide, ﬂat ducts, or to ducts of triangular or otherirregular shapes. Experimental data must be used when precise design information isrequired for speciﬁc situations. 8.8 Solution of Pipe Flow Problems Section 8.7 provides us with a complete scheme for solving many different pipe ﬂow problems. For convenience we collect together the relevant computing equations. Theenergy equation , relating the conditions at any two points 1 and 2 for a single- path pipe system, is p1 ρ1α1V2 1 21gz1 ! 2p2 ρ1α2V22 21gz2 ! 5hlT5X hl1X hlmð8:29Þ This equation expresses the fact that there will be a loss of mechanical energy (“pressure,” kinetic and/or potential) in the pipe. Recall that for turbulent ﬂows α/C251. Note that by judicious choice of points 1 and 2 we can analyze not only the entire pipesystem, but also just a certain section of it that we may be interested in. The total head lossis given by the sum of the major and minor losses. (Remember that we can also include “negative losses” for any pumps present between points 1 and 2. The relevantform of the energy equation is then Eq. 8.49.) Each major loss is given by h l5fL DV2 2ð8:34Þ where the friction factor is obtained from f564 Refor laminar flow ðRe,2300Þ ð8:36Þ or 1ﬃﬃﬃ fp522:0 loge=D 3:712:51 Reﬃﬃﬃfp ! for turbulent flow ðRe$2300Þ ð8:37Þ and Eqs. 8.36 and 8.37 are presented graphically in the Moody chart (Fig. 8.13 ). Each minor loss is given either by h lm5KV2 2ð8:40aÞ where Kis the device loss coefﬁcient ,o r hlm5fLe DV2 2ð8:40bÞ where Leis the additional equivalent length of pipe. We also note that the ﬂow rate Qis related to the average velocity Vat each pipe cross section by Q5πD2 4V We will apply these equations ﬁrst to single-path systems.8.8 Solution of Pipe Flow Problems 369Single-Path Systems In single-path pipe problems we generally know the system conﬁguration (type of pipe material and hence pipe roughness, the number and type of elbows, valves, and other ﬁttings, etc., and changes of elevation), as well as the ﬂuid ( ρand μ) we will be working with. Although not the only possibilities, usually the goal is to determine oneof the following: (a)The pressure drop Δp, for a given pipe ( LandD), and ﬂow rate Q. (b)The pipe length L, for a given pressure drop Δp, pipe diameter D, and ﬂow rate Q. (c)The ﬂow rate Q, for a given pipe ( LandD), and pressure drop Δp. (d)The pipe diameter D, for a given pipe length L, pressure drop Δp, and ﬂow rate Q. Each of these cases often arises in real-world situations. For example, case (a) is anecessary step in selecting the correct size pump to maintain the desired ﬂow rate ina system—the pump must be able to produce the system Δpat the speciﬁed ﬂow rate Q. (We will discuss this in more detail in Chapter 10.) Cases (a) and (b) are com- putationally straightforward; we will see that cases (c) and (d) can be a little tricky toevaluate. We will discuss each case, and present an Example for each. The Examplespresent solutions as you might do them using a calculator, but there is also an Excel workbook for each. (Remember that the Web site has an Excel add-in that once installed will automatically compute ffrom Reande/D!) The advantage of using a computer application such as a spreadsheet is that we do not have to use either theMoody chart (Fig. 8.13 ) or solve the implicit Colebrook equation (Eq. 8.37) to obtain turbulent friction factors—the application can ﬁnd them for us! In addition, as we’llsee, cases (c) and (d) involve signiﬁcant iterative calculations that can be avoided byuse of a computer application. Finally, once we have a solution using a computerapplication, engineering “what-ifs” become easy, e.g., if we double the head producedby a pump, how much will the ﬂow rate in a given system increase? a. Find Δp for a Given L, D, and Q These types of problems are quite straightforward—the energy equation (Eq. 8.29)can be solved directly for Δp5ðp 12p2Þin terms of known or computable quantities. The ﬂow rate leads to the Reynolds number (or numbers if there is a diameterchange) and hence the friction factor (or factors) for the ﬂow; tabulated data can beused for minor loss coefﬁcients and equivalent lengths. The energy equation can then be used to directly obtain the pressure drop. Example 8.5 illustrates this type of problem. b. Find L for a Given Δp, D, and Q These types of problems are also straightforward—the energy equation (Eq. 8.29) canbe solved directly for Lin terms of known or computable quantities. The ﬂow rate again leads to the Reynolds number and hence the friction factor for the ﬂow.Tabulated data can be used for minor loss coefﬁcients and equivalent lengths. The energy equation can then be rearranged and solved directly for the pipe length. Example 8.6 illustrates this type of problem. c. Find Q for a Given Δp, L, and D These types of problems require either manual iteration or use of a computer appli-cation such as Excel . The unknown ﬂow rate or velocity is needed before the Reynolds370 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous Flownumber and hence the friction factor can be found. To manually iterate we ﬁrst solve the energy equation directly for Vin terms of known quantities and the unknown friction factor f. To start the iterative process we make a guess for f(a good choice is to take a value from the fully turbulent region of the Moody chart because many practical ﬂowsare in this region) and obtain a value for V. Then we can compute a Reynolds number and hence obtain a new value for f. We repeat the iteration process f-V-Re-funtil convergence (usually only two or three iterations are necessary). A much quickerprocedure is to use a computer application. For example, spreadsheets (such as Excel ) have built-in solving features for solving one or more algebraic equations for one ormore unknowns. Example 8.7 illustrates this type of problem. d. Find D for a Given Δp, L, and Q These types of problems arise, for example, when we have designed a pump-pipesystem and wish to choose the best pipe diameter—the best being the minimumdiameter (for minimum pipe cost) that will deliver the design ﬂow rate. We need tomanually iterate, or use a computer application such as Excel. The unknown diameter is needed before the Reynolds number and relative roughness, and hence the frictionfactor, can be found. To manually iterate we could ﬁrst solve the energy equation directly for Din terms of known quantities and the unknown friction factor f, and then iterate from a starting guess for fin a way similar to case (c) above: f-D-Re ande=D-f. In practice this is a little unwieldy, so instead to manually ﬁnd a solution we make successive guesses for Duntil the corresponding pressure drop Δp(for the given ﬂow rate Q) computed from the energy equation matches the design Δp.A si n case (c) a much quicker procedure is to use a computer application. For example, spreadsheets (such as Excel) have built-in solving features for solving one or more algebraic equations for one or more unknowns. Example 8.8 illustrates this type of problem. In choosing a pipe size, it is logical to work with diameters that are available commercially. Pipe is manufactured in a limited number of standard sizes. Some data for standard pipe sizes are given in Table 8.5 . For data on extra strong or double extra strong pipes, consult a handbook, e.g., [11]. Pipe larger than 12 in. nominal diameter isproduced in multiples of 2 in. up to a nominal diameter of 36 in. and in multiples of 6in. for still larger sizes.

A pump is attached to the end of the pipe to pump water into the reservoir at a volume ﬂow rate of 0.01 m3/s. What pressure (gage) must the pump produce at the pipe to generate this ﬂow rate? The inside diameter of the smooth pipe is 75 mm. Given: Water is pumped at 0.01 m3/s through a 75-mm- diameter smooth pipe, with L5100 m, into a constant-level reservoir of depth d510 m.

Example 8.6 FLOW IN A PIPELINE: LENGTH UNKNOWN Crude oil ﬂows through a level section of the Alaskan pipeline at a rate of 1.6 million barrels per day (1 barrel 5 42 gal). The pipe inside diameter is 48 in.; its roughness is equivalent to galvanized iron. The maximum allowable pressure is 1200 psi; the minimum pressure required to keep dissolved gases in solution in the crude oil is 50 psi. The crude oil has SG 50.93; its viscosity at the pumping temperature of 140/C14Fi sμ53.531024lbf/C1s/ft2. For these conditions, determine the maximum possible spacing between pumping stations.

We can drawtwo control volumes: CV 1, for the pipe ﬂow (state 2to state 1); CV 2, for the pump (state 1to state 2). First we apply the energy equation for steady, incompressible pipe ﬂow to CV 1.

For a large value of Re(e.g., 108), and a roughness ratio e/D/C250.005 ( e50.00085 ft for cast iron is obtained from Table 8.1, and doubled to allow for the fact that the pipe is old), we ﬁnd that f/C250.03.

A copper pipe 10 ft long, with 1.5 in. i.d., was used for the tests. Thepipe discharged to atmosphere. For a square-edged entrance, a discharge of 0.566 ft 3/s was measured when the reservoir level was 85.1 ft above the pipe centerline. From these data, evaluate the loss coefﬁcient for a square-edged entrance. Given: Pipe with square-edged entrance discharging from reservoir as shown. Find: Kentrance .

The hydraulic and energy grade lines are shown below. The large head loss in a square-edged entrance is due primarily to separation at the sharp inlet corner and formation of a vena contracta immediately downstream from the corner. The effective ﬂow area reaches a minimumat the vena contracta, so the ﬂow velocity is a maximum there. The ﬂow expands again following the vena contractato ﬁll the pipe. The uncontrolled expansion following the vena contracta is responsible for most of the head loss. (See Example 8.12.) Rounding the inlet corner reduces the extent of separation signiﬁcantly. This reduces the velocity increase through the vena contracta and conse- quently reduces the head loss caused by the entrance. A “well-rounded” inletalmost eliminates ﬂow separation; the ﬂow pattern approaches that shown inFig. 8.1 . The added head loss in a well-rounded inlet compared with fully developed ﬂow is the result of higher wall shear stresses in the entrancelength.Entrance Local velocity reaches a maximum at the vena contracta.z1 Hydraulic grade lineExitEnergy grade line0.459 V2___ 2g2_V2___ 2g2_ V2___ 2g2_fL__ D100 50 0Elevation, ftThis prob lem: üIllustratesamethodforobtainingthevalueofamino rloss coefﬁcientfromexperimental data.üShowshow theEGL and HGL linesﬁrst introduced inSection6.5forinviscidﬂowaremodiﬁedbythepresenceofmajorandminorlosses.TheEGL line continuouslydropsasmechanicalenergyis consumed— quitesharplywhen,forexample,wehave asquare-edged entranceloss;theHGL ateachlocation is lowerthantheEGL byanamountequaltothelocal dynamicheadV2=2g—at thevenacontracta,forexample,theHGLexperiencesalargedrop,thenrecovers. Example 8.10 USE OF DIFFUSER TO INCREASE FLOW RATE Water rights granted to each citizen by the Emperor of Rome gave permission to attach to the public water maina calibrated, circular, tubular bronze nozzle [23]. Some citizens were clever enough to take unfair advantage of alaw that regulated ﬂow rate by such an indirect method. They installed diffusers on the outlets of the nozzles toincrease their discharge. Assume the static head available from the main is z 051.5 m and the nozzle exit diameter isD525 mm. (The discharge is to atmospheric pressure.) Determine the increase in ﬂow rate when a diffuser with N/R153.0 and AR52.0 is attached to the end of the nozzle.380 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous FlowGiven: Nozzle attached to water main as shown.

There are two ways to explain this. First, we can sketch the EGL and HGL curves—approximately to scale—as shown below. We can see that, as required, the HGL at the exit is zero for both ﬂows (recall that the HGL is the sum of static pressure and potential heads). However, the pressure rises through the diffuser, so the pressure at the diffuser inlet will be, as shown, quitelow (below atmospheric). Hence, with the diffuser, the Δpdriving force for the nozzle is much larger than that for the bare nozzle, leading to a much greater velocity, and ﬂow rate, at the nozzle exit plane—it is as if the diffuser actedas a suction device on the nozzle. Second, we can examine the energy equations for the two ﬂows (for the bare nozzle Eq. 1, and for the nozzle with diffuser Eq. 3). These equations can be rearranged to yield equations for the velocity at the nozzle exit, V15ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2gz0 11Kentrances ðbare nozzle Þ V15ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2gz0 1 ðARÞ21Kdiffuser1Kentrancevuuutðnozzle1diffuser Þ Comparing these two expressions, we see that the diffuser introduces an extra term (its loss coefﬁcient K diffuser50.3) to the denominator, tending to reduce the nozzle velocity, but on the other hand we replace the term 1 (representing loss of the bare nozzle exit plane kinetic energy) with 1/( AR)250.25 (representing a smaller loss, of the diffuser exit plane kinetic energy). The net effect is that we replace 1 in the denominator with 0.25 10.350.55, leading to a net382 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous Flow*Multiple-Path Systems Many real-world pipe systems (e.g., the pipe network that supplies water to the apartments in a large building) consist of a network of pipes of various diametersassembled in a complicated conﬁguration that may contain parallel and series con- nections. As an example, consider part of a system as shown in Fig. 8.18 . Water is supplied at some pressure from a manifold at point 1, and ﬂows through the com- ponents shown to the drain at point 5. Some water ﬂows through pipes A,B,C,a n dD , constituting a series of pipes (and pipe Bhas a lower ﬂow rate than the others); some ﬂows through A,E,ForG,H,C, and D(FandGareparallel ), and these two main branches are in parallel . We analyze this type of problem in a similar way to how we analyze DC resistor circuits in electrical theory: by applying a few basic rules to thesystem. The electrical potential at each point in the circuit is analogous to the HGL (or static pressure head if we neglect gravity) at corresponding points in the system. The current in each resistor is analogous to the ﬂow rate in each pipe section. We havethe additional difﬁculty in pipe systems that the resistance to ﬂow in each pipe is afunction of the ﬂow rate (electrical resistors are usually considered constant). The simple rules for analyzing networks can be expressed in various ways. We will express them as follows: 1.The net ﬂow out of any node (junction) is zero. 2.Each node has a unique pressure head (HGL).increase in the nozzle velocity. The resistance to ﬂow introduced by adding the diffuser is more than made up by thefact that we “throw away” much less kinetic energy at the exit of the device (the exit velocity for the bare nozzle is5.32 m/s, whereas for the diffuser it is 1.77 m/s). Water Commissioner Frontinus standardized conditions for all Romans in 97 A.D. He required that the tube attached to the nozzle of each customer’s pipe be the same diameter for at least 50 lineal feet from the public water main (see Problem 8.157).0 1V2z0 z V1 20 1V1z0 z Hydraulic grade line Hydraulic grade lineEnergy grade line Energy grade line z01.5 1.0 0.5 0Elevation, mz01.5 1.0 0.5 0 –0.5 –1.0 Elevation, m0.04V1___ 2g20.04 V1___ 2g2 V1___ 2g2V1___ 2g2 2V2___ 2g_ ___ _ _ _ _ *This section may be omitted without loss of continuity in the text material.8.8 Solution of Pipe Flow Problems 383For example, in Fig. 8.18 rule 1 means that the ﬂow into node 2 from pipe Amust equal the sum of outﬂows to pipes BandE. Rule 2 means that the pressure head at node 7 must be equal to the head at node 6 less the losses through pipe For pipe G,a s well as equal to the head at node 3 plus the loss in pipe H. These rules apply in addition to all the pipe-ﬂow constraints we have discussed (e.g., forRe$2300 the ﬂow will be turbulent, and the fact that we may have signiﬁcant minor losses from features such as sudden expansions). We can anticipate that the ﬂow in pipe F(diameter 1 in.) will be a good deal less than the ﬂow in pipe G(diameter 1.5 in), and the ﬂow through branch Ewill be larger than that through branch B(why?). The problems that arise with pipe networks can be as varied as those we discussed when studying single-path systems, but the most common involve ﬁnding the ﬂow delivered to each pipe, given an applied pressure difference. We examine this case in Example 8.11. Obviously, pipe networks are much more difﬁcult and time-consuming toanalyze than single-path problems, almost always requiring iterative solution methods,and in practice are usually only solved us ing the computer. A number of computer schemes for analyzing networks have been developed [24], and many engineeringconsulting companies use proprietary softwa re applications for such analysis. A spread- sheet such as Excel is also very useful for setting up and solving such problems.1 2 3 5476A C DE A: B: C: D: E:F: G:H:G F B HL = 10 ft, D = 1.5 in.L = 20 ft, D = 1.5 in.L = 10 ft, D = 2 in.L = 10 ft, D = 1.5 in.L = 5 ft, D = 1.5 in.L = 10 ft, D = 1 in.

For the cast-iron pipe, Table 8.1 gives a roughness for cast iron of e50.00085 ft. Assumptions: (1) Ignore gravity effects. (2) Ignore minor losses. (Assumption 2 is applied to make the analysis clearer—minor losses can be incorporated easily later.) In addition we have mathematical expressions for the basic rules 1.The net ﬂow out of any node (junction) is zero. 2.Each node has a unique pressure head (HGL). We can apply basic rule 1 to nodes 2 and 6: Node 2 :QA5QB1QEð1Þ Node 6 :QE5QF1QGð2Þ and we also have the obvious constraints QA5QCð3Þ QA5QDð4Þ QE5QHð5Þ We can apply basic rule 2 to obtain the following pressure drop constraints: h125:h5hA1hB1hC1hDð6Þ h223:hB5hE1hF1hHð7Þ h627:hF5hGð8Þ This set of eight equations (as well as Eqs. 8.29 and 8.34 for each pipe section!) must be solved iteratively. If we were to manually iterate, we would use Eqs. 3, 4, and 5 to immediately reduce the number of unknowns and equations toﬁve ( Q A,QB,QE,QF,QG). There are several approaches to the iteration, one of which is: 1.Make a guess for QA,QB,a n dQ F. 2.Eqs. 1 and 2 then lead to values for QEandQG. 3.Eqs. 6, 7, and 8 are ﬁnally used as a check to see if rule 2 (for unique pressure heads at the nodes) is satisﬁed. 4.If any of Eqs. 6, 7, or 8 are not satisﬁed, use knowledge of pipe ﬂow to adjust the values of QA,QB,o rQF. 5.Repeat steps 2 through 5 until convergence occurs. An example of applying step 4 would be if Eq. 8 were not satisﬁed. Suppose hF.hG; then we would have selected too large a value for QF, and would reduce this slightly, and recompute all ﬂow rates and heads. This iterative process is obviously quite unrealistic for manual calculation (remember that obtaining each head losshfrom each Qinvolves a good amount of calculation). Fortunately, we can use a spreadsheet such as Excel to automate all these calculations—it will simultaneously solve for all eight unknowns automatically! The ﬁrst step is to set up one worksheet for each pipe section for computing the pipe head hgiven the ﬂow rate Q. A typical such worksheet is shown below: In these worksheets, knowing L,D, and e, a given ﬂow rate Qis used to compute V,Re,f, and ﬁnally hfrom L,D, and e. 8.8 Solution of Pipe Flow Problems 385The next step is to set up a calculation page that collects together the ﬂow rates and corresponding head losses for all of the pipe sections, and then use these to check whether Eqs. 1 through 8 are satisﬁed. Shown below is this page with initial guess values of 0.1 ft3/s for each of the ﬂow rates. The logic of the workbook is that the eight values entered for QAthrough QHdetermine all the other values—that is, hAthrough hH, and the values of the constraint equations. The absolute errors for each of the constraint equations are shown, as well as their sum. We can then use Excel ’sSolver feature (repeatedly as necessary) to minimize the total error (currently 735%) by varying QAthrough QH. The ﬁnal results obtained by Excel are: 386 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous FlowPART C Flow Measurement Throughout this text we have referred to the ﬂow rate Qor average velocity Vin a pipe. The question arises: How does one measure these quantities? We will address this question by discussing the various types of ﬂow meters available. The choice of a ﬂow meter is inﬂuenced by the accuracy required, range, cost, complication, ease of reading or data reduction, and service life. The simplest andcheapest device that gives the desired accuracy should be chosen. 8.9 Direct Methods The most obvious way to measure ﬂow rate in a pipe is the direct method—simply measure the amount of ﬂuid that accumulates in a container over a ﬁxed time period!Tanks can be used to determine ﬂow rate for steady liquid ﬂows by measuring thevolume or mass of liquid collected during a known time interval. If the time interval islong enough to be measured accurately, ﬂow rates may be determined precisely in this way. Compressibility must be considered in volume measurements for gas ﬂows. The densities of gases generally are too small to permit accurate direct measurement of mass ﬂow rate. However, a volume sample often can be collected by displacing a“bell,” or inverted jar over water (if the pressure is held constant by counterweights).If volume or mass measurements are set up carefully, no calibration is required; this isa great advantage of direct methods. In specialized applications, particularly for remote or recording uses, positive dis- placement ﬂow meters may be speciﬁed, in which the ﬂuid moves a component such as a reciprocating piston or oscillating disk as it passes through the device. Commonexamples include household water and natural gas meters, which are calibrated toread directly in units of product, or gasoline metering pumps, which measure totalﬂow and automatically compute the cost. Many positive-displacement meters areavailable commercially. Consult manufacturers’ literature or References (e.g., [25])for design and installation details. 8.10 Restriction Flow Meters for Internal Flows Most restriction ﬂow meters for internal ﬂow (except the laminar ﬂow element, dis-cussed shortly) are based on acceleration of a ﬂuid stream through some form ofnozzle, as shown schematically in Fig. 8.19 .

This Δpcan be measured using a pressure gage (electronic or mechanical) or a manometer, and the ﬂow rate inferred using either a theoretical analysis or an experimental correlation for the device. Flow separation at the sharp edgeof the nozzle throat causes a recirculation zone to form, as shown by the dashed lines downstream from the nozzle. The mainstream ﬂow continues to accelerate from the nozzle throat to form a vena contracta at section 2and then decelerates again to ﬁll the duct. At the vena contracta, the ﬂow area is a minimum, the ﬂow streamlines areessentially straight, and the pressure is uniform across the channel section. The theoretical ﬂow rate may be related to the pressure differential between sec- tions 1and 2by applying the continuity and Bernoulli equations. Then empirical correction factors may be applied to obtain the actual ﬂow rate. Basic equations:We will need mass-conservation, X CS~V/C1~A50 ð4:13bÞ [we can use this instead of Eq. 4.12, because of assumption (5) below] and the Bernoulli equation, 2 2 /H11001/H11001 gz1/H11005p1V1 2/H11001/H11001 gz2p2V2 2 /H9267/H9267ð6:8Þ which we can use if assumption (4) is valid.

This relationship limits the ﬂow rates that can be measured accurately to approximately a 4:1 range. Several factors limit the utility of Eq. 8.52 for calculating the actual mass ﬂow rate through a meter. The actual ﬂow area at section 2is unknown when the vena con- tracta is pronounced (e.g., for oriﬁce plates when Dtis a small fraction of D1). The velocity proﬁles approach uniform ﬂow only at large Reynolds numbers. Frictionaleffects can become important (especially downstream from the meter) when themeter contours are abrupt. Finally, the location of pressure taps inﬂuences the dif-ferential pressure reading. The theoretical equation is adjusted for Reynolds number and diameter ratio D t/D1 by deﬁning an empirical discharge coefﬁcient C such that, replacing Eq. 8.52, we have /C1mactual5CAtﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 12ðAt=A1Þ2pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2ρðp12p2Þp ð8:53Þ Letting β5Dt=D1, then ðAt=A1Þ25ðDt=D1Þ45β4,s o /C1mactual5CAtﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 12β4pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2ρðp12p2Þp ð8:54Þ In Eq. 8.54, 1 =ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 12β4p is the velocity-of-approach factor .

The accuracy of the equations (within speciﬁedranges) usually is adequate so that the meter can be used without calibration. If theReynolds number, pipe size, or bore diameter fall outside the speciﬁed range ofthe equation, the coefﬁcients must be measured experimentally. For the turbulent ﬂow regime (pipe Reynolds number greater than 4000) the dis- charge coefﬁcient may be expressed by an equation of the form [25] C5CN1b Ren D1ð8:57Þ The corresponding form for the ﬂow-coefﬁcient equation is K5KN11ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 12β4pb Ren D1ð8:58Þ In Eqs. 8.57 and 8.58, subscript Ndenotes the coefﬁcient at inﬁnite Reynolds number; constants bandnallow for scaling to ﬁnite Reynolds numbers. Correlating equations and curves of coefﬁcients versus Reynolds number are given in the next three subsections, following a general comparison of the chara cteristics of speciﬁc metering elements. As we have noted, selection of a ﬂow meter depends on factors such as cost, accu- racy, need for calibration, and ease of installation and maintenance. Some of thesefactors are compared for oriﬁce plate ,ﬂow nozzle ,a n d venturi meters in Table 8.6. Note that a high head loss means that the running cost of the device is high—it will consume alot of the ﬂuid energy. A high initial cost must be amortized over the life of the device.This is an example of a common cost calculation for a company (and an individual!)—between a high initial but low running cost, or low initial but high running cost. Flow meter coefﬁcients reported in the literature have been measured with fully developed turbulent velocity distributions at the meter inlet (Section 1). If a ﬂow meter is to be installed downstream from a valve, elbow, or other disturbance,a straight section of pipe must be placed in front of the meter. Approximately10 diameters of straight pipe are required for venturi meters, and up to 40 diametersfor oriﬁce plate or ﬂow nozzle meters. When a meter has been properly installed, theﬂow rate may be computed from Eq. 8.54 or 8.56, after choosing an appropriate valuefor the empirical discharge coefﬁcient, C, or ﬂow coefﬁcient, K, deﬁned in Eqs. 8.53 and 8.55, respectively. Some design data for incompressible ﬂow are given in the next few sections. The same basic methods can be extended to compressible ﬂows, but these will not be treated here. For complete details, see Miller [25] or Bean [26].

Since its geometry is simple, it is low in cost and easy to install or replace. The sharp edge of the oriﬁce will not foul with scale or susp ended matter. However, suspended matter can build up at the inlet side of a concentric oriﬁce in a horizontal pipe; an eccentricoriﬁce may be placed ﬂush with the bottom of the pipe to avoid this difﬁculty. The pri-mary disadvantages of the oriﬁce are its limited capacity and the high permanent headloss caused by the uncontrolled expansi on downstream from the metering element. Pressure taps for oriﬁces may be placed in several locations, as shown in Fig. 8.20 (see [25] or [26] for additional details). Since the location of the pressure taps inﬂu-ences the empirically determined ﬂow coefﬁcient, one must select handbook values ofCorKconsistent with the location of pressure taps. The correlating equation re commended for a concentric oriﬁce with corner taps [25] is C50:595910:0312β 2:120:184β8191:71β2:5 Re0:75 D1ð8:59Þ Equation 8.59 is the form of Eq. 8.57 for the discharge coefﬁcient Cfor the oriﬁce plate; it predicts oriﬁce discharge coefﬁcients within 60.6 percent for 0.2 ,β,0.75 and for 104,ReD1,107. Some ﬂow coefﬁcients calculated from Eq. 8.59 and 8.55 are presented in Fig. 8.21 . A similar correlating equation is available for oriﬁce plates with DandD/2 taps. Flange taps require a different correlation for every line size. Pipe taps, located at 21 2 and 8 D, no longer are recommended for accurate work. Example 8.12, which appears later in this section, illustrates the application of ﬂow coefﬁcient data to oriﬁce sizing. The Flow Nozzle Flow nozzles may be used as metering elements in either plenums or ducts, as shown in Fig. 8.22 ; the nozzle section is approximately a quarter ellipse.

Since the plenum pressure is equal to p2, the location of the downstream pressure tap is not critical. Meters suitable for a wide range of ﬂow rates may be made by installing several nozzles in a plenum. At low ﬂow rates, most of them may beplugged. For higher ﬂow rates, more nozzles may be used. For plenum nozzles β50, which is outside the range of applicability of Eq. 8.58. Typical ﬂow coefﬁcients are in the range, 0.95 ,K,0.99; the larger values apply at high Reynolds numbers. Thus the mass rate of ﬂow can be computed withinapproximately 62 percent using Eq. 8.56 with K50:97. The Venturi Venturi meters, as sketched in Table 8.6, are generally made from castings and machined to close tolerances to duplicate the performance of the standard design. Asa result, venturi meters are heavy, bulky, and expensive. The conical diffuser sectiondownstream from the throat gives excellent pressure recovery; therefore, overall head loss is low. Venturi meters are also self-cleaning because of their smooth internal contours. Experimental data show that discharge coefﬁcients for venturi meters range from 0.980 to 0.995 at high Reynolds numbers ( Re D1.23105). Thus C50:99 can be used to measure mass ﬂow rate within about 61 percent at high Reynolds number [25]. Consult manufacturers’ literature for speciﬁc information at Reynolds numbersbelow 10 The oriﬁce plate, ﬂow nozzle, and venturi all produce pressure differentials pro- portional to the square of the ﬂow rate, according to Eq. 8.56. In practice, a meter sizemust be chosen to accommodate the highest ﬂow rate expected. Because the rela-tionship of pressure drop to ﬂow rate is nonlinear, the range of ﬂow rate that can bemeasured accurately is limited. Flow meters with single throats usually are consideredonly for ﬂow rates over a 4:1 range [25].1.22 1.20 1.181.16 1.14 1.12 1.101.08 1.06 1.04 1.02 1.00 0.98 0.96 10 410525 1 0625 1 07250.250.350.450.550.650.75 Diameter ratio, = βDt___ D1 Reynolds number, ReD1 = VD1______ρ μFlow coefficient, K _ Fig. 8.23 Flow coefﬁcients for ASME long-radius ﬂow nozzles.8.10 Restriction Flow Meters for Internal Flows 393The unrecoverable loss in head across a metering element may be expressed as a fraction of the differential pressure, Δp, across the element. Pressure losses are dis- played as functions of diameter ratio in Fig. 8.24 [25]. Note that the venturi meter has a much lower permanent head loss than the oriﬁce (which has the highest loss) or nozzle, conﬁrming the trends we summarized in Table 8.6. The Laminar Flow Element The laminar ﬂow element3is designed to produce a pressure differential directly proportional to ﬂow rate. The idea is that the laminar ﬂow element (LFE) contains ametering section in which the ﬂow passes through a large number of tubes or passages(these often look like a bunch of straws) that are each narrow enough that the ﬂowthrough them is laminar, regardless of the ﬂow conditions in the main pipe (recallthat Re tube5ρVtubeDtube=μ,s oi f Dtubeis made small enough we can ensure that Retube,Recrit/C252300). For each laminar ﬂow tube we can apply the results of Section 8.3, speciﬁcally Qtube5πD4 tube 128μLtubeΔp~Δp ð8:13cÞ so the ﬂow rate in each tube is a linear function of the pressure drop across the device. The ﬂow rate in the whole pipe will be the sum of each of these tube ﬂows, and so willalso be a linear function of pressure drop. Usually this linear relation is provided in acalibration from the manufacturer, and the LFE can be used over a 10:1 range of ﬂow rates. The relationship between pressure drop and ﬂow rate for laminar ﬂow also depends on viscosity, which is a strong function of temperature. Therefore, the ﬂuidtemperature must be known to obtain accurate metering with an LFE. A laminar ﬂow element costs approximately as much as a venturi, but it is much lighter and smaller. Thus the LFE is becoming widely used in applications wherecompactness and extended range are important.Flow nozzleSquare-edge orifice Venturi 15° exit cone 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.1 0102030405060708090100 0.2 0.3 0.4Permanent head loss, percent of differential Diameter ratio, = βDt___ D1 Fig. 8.24 Permanent head loss produced by various ﬂow meter- ing elements [25]. 3Patented and manufactured by Meriam Instrument Co., 10920 Madison Ave., Cleveland, Ohio 44102.394 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous FlowExample 8.12 FLOW THROUGH AN ORIFICE METER An air ﬂow rate of 1 m3/s at standard conditions is expected in a 0.25-m diameter duct.

Several ﬂow meter types produce outputs that are directly proportional to ﬂow rate. These meters produce signals without theneed to measure differential pressure. The most common linear ﬂow meters are dis-cussed brieﬂy in the following paragraphs. Float meters may be used to indicate ﬂow rate directly for liquids or gases. An example is shown in Fig. 8.25 In operation, the ball or ﬂoat is carried upward in the tapered clear tube by the ﬂowing ﬂuid until the drag force and ﬂoat weight are in equilibrium. Such meters (often called rotameters ) are available with factory cali- bration for a number of common ﬂuids and ﬂow rate ranges. A free-running vaned impeller may be mounted in a cylindrical section of tube (Fig. 8.26 ) to make a turbine ﬂow meter . With proper design, the rate of rotation of the impeller may be made closely proportional to volume ﬂow rate over a wide range. Rotational speed of the turbine element can be sensed using a magnetic or modulated carrier pickup external to the meter. This sensing method therefore requires no penetrations or seals in the duct. Thus turbine ﬂow meters can be usedNow V35Q=A1, and V25Q A25Q 0:65At5Q 0:65β2A1 Thus, p32p25ρQ2 A2 11 0:65β2212 435 p 32p251:23kg m33ð1Þ2m6 s2342 π21 ð0:25Þ4m41 0:65ð0:66Þ2212435 N/C1s2 kg/C1m p32p251290 N =m2 The diameter ratio, β, was selected to give maximum manometer deﬂection at maximum ﬂow rate.

The electrical signal can be displayed, recorded, or integrated to provide total ﬂow information. An interesting device is the vortex ﬂow meter . This device takes advantage of the fact that a uniform ﬂow will generate a vortex street when it encounters a bluff bodysuch as a cylinder perpendicular to the ﬂow. A vortex street is a series of alternatingvortices shed from the rear of the body; the alternation generates an oscillatingsideways force on, and therefore oscillation of, the cylinder (the classic example ofthis being the “singing” of telephone wires in a high wind). It turns out that thedimensionless group characterizing this phenomenon is the Strouhal number,St5fL=V(fis the vortex shedding frequency, Lis the cylinder diameter, and Vis the freestream velocity), and it is approximately constant ( St/C250:21). Hence we have a device for which V~f. Measurement of fthus directly indicates the velocity ~V (however, the velocity proﬁle does affect the shedding frequency so calibration isrequired). The cylinder used in a ﬂow meter is usually quite short in length—10 mmor less—and placed perpendicular to the ﬂow (and for some devices is not a cylinderat all but some other small bluff object). The oscillation can be measured using astrain gage or other sensor. Vortex ﬂow meters can be used over a 20:1 range of ﬂowrates [25]. The electromagnetic ﬂow meter uses the principle of magnetic induction. A magnetic ﬁeld is created across a pipe. When a conductive ﬂuid passes through theﬁeld, a voltage is generated at right angles to the ﬁeld and velocity vectors. Elec- trodes placed on a pipe diameter are used to detect the resulting signal voltage. Thesignal voltage is proportional to the average axial velocity when the proﬁle isaxisymmetric. Magnetic ﬂow meters may be used with liquids that have electrical conductivities above 100 microsiemens per meter (1 siemen 51 ampere per volt). The minimum ﬂow speed should be above about 0.3 m/s, but there are no restrictions on Reynolds number. The ﬂow rate range normally quoted is 10:1 [25]. Ultrasonic ﬂow meters also respond to average velocity at a pipe cross section. Two principal types of ultrasonic meters are common: Propagation time is measured for clean liquids, and reﬂection frequency shift (Doppler effect) is measured for ﬂowscarrying particulates. The speed of an acoustic wave increases in the ﬂow directionand decreases when transmitted against the ﬂow. For clean liquids, an acoustic pathinclined to the pipe axis is used to infer ﬂow velocity. Multiple paths are used toestimate the volume ﬂow rate accurately. Doppler effect ultrasonic ﬂow meters depend on reﬂection of sonic waves (in the MHz range) from scattering particles in the ﬂuid. When the particles move at ﬂowspeed, the frequency shift is proportional to ﬂow speed; for a suitably chosen path,output is proportional to volume ﬂow rate. One or two transducers may be used; themeter may be clamped to the outside of the pipe. Ultrasonic meters may requirecalibration in place. Flow rate range is 10:1 [25].Water (gph)10203040 Fig. 8.25 Float-type variable-area ﬂow meter. (Courtesy of Dwyer Instrument Co., MichiganCity, Indiana.) Fig. 8.26 Turbine ﬂow meter. (Courtesy of Potter Aeronautical Corp., Union, New Jersey.)398 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous Flow8.12 Traversing Methods In situations such as in air handling or refrigeration equipment, it may be impractical or impossible to install ﬁxed ﬂow meters. In such cases it may be possible to obtain ﬂow rate data using traversing techniques. To make a ﬂow rate measurement by traverse, the duct cross section is con- ceptually subdivided into segments of equal area. The velocity is measured at thecenter of each area segment using a pitot tube, a total head tube, or a suitableanemometer. The volume ﬂow rate for each segment is approximated by the productof the measured velocity and the segment area. The ﬂow rate through the entire ductis the sum of these segmental ﬂow rates. Details of recommended procedures for ﬂow rate measurements by the traverse method are given in [27]. Use of pitot orpitot-static tubes for traverse measurements requires direct access to the ﬂow ﬁeld. Pitot tubes give uncertain results when pressure gradients or streamline curvature are present, and their response times are slow. Two types of anemometers—thermal anemometers and laser Doppler anemometers (LDAs)—overcome these difﬁculties partially, although they introduce new complications. Thermal anemometers use tiny elements (either hot-wire or hot-ﬁlm elements) that are heated electrically. Sophisticated electronic feedback circuits are used to maintain the temperature of the element constant and to sense the input heating rate needed to do this. The heating rate is related to the local ﬂow velocity by calibration (a highervelocity leads to more heat transfer). The primary advantage of thermal anemometersis the small size of the sensing element. Sensors as small as 0.002 mm in diameter and0.1 mm long are available commercially. Because the thermal mass of such tiny ele-ments is extremely small, their response to ﬂuctuations in ﬂow velocity is rapid.Frequency responses to the 50 kHz range have been quoted [28]. Thus thermalanemometers are ideal for measuring turbulence quantities. Insulating coatings may be applied to permit their use in conductive or corrosive gases or liquids. Because of their fast response and small size, thermal anemometers are used extensively for research. Numerous schemes have been published for treating the resulting data [29]. Digital processing techniques, including fast Fourier transforms,can be applied to the signals to obtain mean values and moments, and to analyzefrequency content and correlations.

VIDEO Laser Doppler Anemometry (Animation) . 8.12 Traversing Methods 399Laser Doppler anemometers are becoming widely used for specialized applications where direct physical access to the ﬂow ﬁeld is difﬁcult or impossible. One or more laser beams are focused to a small volume in the ﬂow at the location of interest (as shown in Fig 8.27 ). Laser light is scattered from particles that are present in the ﬂow (dust or particulates) or introduced for this purpose. A frequency shift is caused by the local ﬂow speed (Doppler effect). Scattered light and a reference beam are collectedby receiving optics. The frequency shift is proportional to the ﬂow speed; this rela-tionship may be calculated, so there is no need for calibration. Since velocity ismeasured directly, the signal is unaffected by changes in temperature, density, orcomposition in the ﬂow ﬁeld. The primary disadvantages of LDAs are that the opticalequipment is expensive and fragile, and that extremely careful alignment is needed (as the authors can attest). 8.13 Summary and Useful Equations In this chapter we have: üDeﬁned many terms used in the study of internal incompressible viscous ﬂow, such as: the entrance length, fully developed ﬂow, the friction velocity, Reynolds stress, the kinetic energy coefﬁcient, the friction factor, major and minor head losses, and hydraulic diameter. üAnalyzed laminar ﬂow between parallel plates and in pipes and observed that we can obtain the velocity distribution analytically, and from this derive: the average velocity, the maximum velocity and its location, the ﬂow rate, the wall shear stress, and the shear stress distribution. üStudied turbulent ﬂow in pipes and ducts and learned that semi-empirical approaches are needed, e.g., the power-law velocity proﬁle. üWritten the energy equation in a form useful for analyzing pipe ﬂows. üDiscussed how to incorporate pumps, fans, and blowers into a pipe ﬂow analysis. üDescribed various ﬂow measurement devices: direct measurement, restriction devices (oriﬁce plate, nozzle, and venturi), linearﬂow meters (rotameters, various electromagnetic or acoustic devices, and the vortex ﬂow meter), and traversing devices (pitot tubes and laser-Doppler anemometers). We have learned that pipe and duct ﬂow problems often need iterative solution—the ﬂow rate Qis not a linear function of the driving force (usually Δp), except for laminar ﬂows (which are not common in practice). * We have also seen that pipe networks can be analyzed using the same techniques as a single-pipe system, with the addition of a few basic rules, and that in practice a computer application such as Excel is needed to solve all but the simplest networks.

Atthis ﬂow rate, estimate the entrance length required toestablish fully developed ﬂow.8.2 Consider incompressible ﬂow in a circular channel. Derive general expressions for Reynolds number in terms of (a) vol-ume ﬂow rate and tube diameter and (b) mass ﬂow rate and tubediameter. The Reynoldsnumberis 1800in a section where the tube diameter is 10 mm. Find the Reynolds number for thesame ﬂow rate in a section where the tube diameter is 6 mm.Case Study The Fountains at the Bellagio in Las Vegas The fountains at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. Any visitor to Las Vegas will be familiar with the water fountains at the Bellagio hotel. These are a set of high-powered water jets designed and built by the WETDesign Company that are choreographed to vary in their strength and direction to selected pieces of music. WET developed many innovations to make the fountains. Traditional fountains use pumps and pipes,which must be matched for optimum ﬂow (one of the topics we discussed in this chapter). Many of WET’s designs use compressed air instead of water pumps, which allows energy to be continuously generated andaccumulated, ready for instant output. This innovativeuse of compressed air allowed the fountains tobecome a reality—with the traditional systems ofpipes or pumps, a fountain such as the Bellagio’swould be impractical and expensive. For example, itwould be difﬁcult to obtain the 240-foot heights the fountains achieve without expensive, large, and noisy water pumps. The “Shooter” that WET developedworks on the principle of introducing a large bubble ofcompressed air into the piping, which forces trappedwater through a nozzle at high pressure. The onesinstalled at the Bellagio are able to shoot about75 gallons per second of water over 240 feet in the air.In addition to providing a spectacular effect, they require only about 1/10th the energy of traditional water pumps to produce the same effect. Other air-powered devices produce pulsing water jets, achievinga maximum height of 125 feet. In addition to theirpower, these innovations lead to a saving of 80 per-cent or more in energy costs and have project con-struction costs that are about 50 percent less thantraditional pipe-pump fountains.Problems 4038.3 Air at 40/C14C ﬂows in a pipe system in which diameter is decreased in two stages from 25 mm to 15 mm to 10 mm. Each section is 2 m long. As the ﬂow rate is increased, which section will become turbulent ﬁrst? Determine the ﬂow rates at which one, two, and then all three sections ﬁrst becometurbulent. At each of these ﬂow rates, determine which sections, if any, attain fully developed ﬂow. D1 = 25 mmD2 = 15 mm D3 = 10 mm P8.3 8.4 For ﬂow in circular tubes, transition to turbulence usually occurs around Re/C252300. Investigate the circumstances under which the ﬂows of (a) standard air and (b) water at 15/C14C become turbulent. On log-log graphs, plot: the average velocity, the volume ﬂow rate, and the mass ﬂow rate, atwhich turbulence ﬁrst occurs, as functions of tube diameter. Laminar Flow between Parallel Plates 8.5 For the laminar ﬂow in the section of pipe shown in Fig. 8.1 , sketch the expected wall shear stress, pressure, and centerline velocity as functions of distance along the pipe. Explain sig- niﬁcant features of the plots, comparing them with fullydeveloped ﬂow. Can the Bernoulli equation be applied any- where in the ﬂow ﬁeld? If so, where? Explain brieﬂy. 8.6 An incompressible ﬂuid ﬂows between two inﬁnite sta- tionary parallel plates. The velocity proﬁle is given by u5 umaxðAy21By1CÞ, where A,B, and Care constants and y is measured upward from the lower plate. The total gap width is hunits. Use appropriate boundary conditions to express the magnitude and units of the constants in termsofh.

Asteady force of 4500 lbf is applied to the piston. Assume the properties of SAE 30 oil at 120 /C14F. Estimate the rate at which oil leaks past the piston. 8.10 A viscous oil ﬂows steadily between stationary parallel plates. The ﬂow is laminar and fully developed. The total gapwidth between the plates is h55 mm. The oil viscosity is0.5 N /C1s/m 2and the pressure gradient is 21000 N/m2/m. Find the magnitude and direction of the shear stress on the upperplate and the volume ﬂow rate through the channel, per meter of width. 8.11 Viscous oil ﬂows steadily between parallel plates.

Cal- culate the magnitude and direction of the wall shear stressat the upper plate surface. Find the volume ﬂow rate throughthe channel ( μ50:50 N /C1s=m 2). 8.12 A large mass is supported by a piston of diameter D54 in. and length L54 in. The piston sits in a cylinder closed at the bottom, and the gap a50.001 in. between the cylinder wall and piston is ﬁlled with SAE 10 oil at 68/C14F. The piston slowly sinks due to the mass, and oil is forced outat a rate of 0.1 gpm. What is the mass (slugs)? La DM P8.12, P8.16 8.13 A high pressure in a system is created by a small piston- cylinder assembly. The piston diameter is 6 mm and itextends 50 mm into the cylinder. The radial clearancebetween the piston and cylinder is 0.002 mm. Neglect elastic deformations of the piston and cylinder caused by pressure. Assume the ﬂuid properties are those of SAE 10W oil at35 /C14C. When the pressure in the cylinder is 600 MPa, estimate the leakage rate. 8.14 A hydraulic jack supports a load of 9000 kg. The fol- lowing data are given: Diameter of piston 100 mm Radial clearance between piston and cylinder 0.05 mmLength of piston 120 mm Estimate the rate of leakage of hydraulic ﬂuid past the pis- ton, assuming the ﬂuid is SAE 30 oil at 30 /C14C. 8.15 A hydrostatic bearing is to support a load of 1000 lbf/ft of length perpendicular to the diagram. The bearing is sup- plied with SAE 10W-30 oil at 212/C14F and 35 psig through the central slit. Since the oil is viscous and the gap is small,the ﬂow may be considered fully developed. Calculate (a) therequired width of the bearing pad, (b) the resulting pressure gradient, dp/dx , and (c) the gap height, if the ﬂow rate is Q52.5 gal/hr/ft. QxyW h P8.15404 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous Flow8.16 The basic component of a pressure gage tester consists of a piston-cylinder apparatus as shown. The piston, 6 mm in diameter, is loaded to develop a pressure of known mag- nitude. (The piston length is 25 mm.) Calculate the mass, M, required to produce 1.5 MPa (gage) in the cylinder. Determine the leakage ﬂow rate as a function of radial clearance, a, for this load if the liquid is SAE 30 oil at 20/C14C. Specify the maximum allowable radial clearance so the vertical movement of the piston due to leakage will be less than 1 mm/min. 8.17 In Section 8.2 we derived the velocity proﬁle between parallel plates (Eq. 8.5) by using a differential control volume. Instead, following the procedure we used in Example 5.9, derive Eq. 8.5 by starting with the Navier /C0 Stokes equations (Eqs. 5.27). Be sure to state all assumptions. 8.18 Consider the simple power-law model for a non- Newtonian ﬂuid given by Eq. 2.16. Extend the analysis of Section 8.2 to show that the velocity proﬁle for fully devel- oped laminar ﬂow of a power-law ﬂuid between stationary parallel plates separated by distance 2 hmay be written u5h kΔp L/C18/C191=nnh n1112y h/C16/C17ðn11Þ=n/C20/C21 where yis the coordinate measured from the channel centerline.

The ﬂow rate is low, so the ﬂow is laminar, and the pressure gradient due to convective accel-eration in the gap is negligible compared with the gradientcaused by viscous forces (this is termed creeping ﬂow ). Obtain a general expression for the variation of averagevelocity in the gap between the disks. For creeping ﬂow,the velocity proﬁle at any cross section in the gap is the same as for fully developed ﬂow between stationary parallel plates. Evaluate the pressure gradient, dp/dr, as a function of radius. Obtain an expression for p(r).

The upper plate moves to the right with speed U255 ft/s; the lower plate moves to the left with speed U152 ft/s. The pressure gradient in the direction of ﬂow is zero. Develop an expression for thevelocity distribution in the gap. Find the volume ﬂow rate per unit depth (gpm/ft) passing a given cross section. 8.23 Water at 60/C14C ﬂows between two large ﬂat plates. The lower plate moves to the left at a speed of 0.3 m/s; the upper plate is stationary. The plate spacing is 3 mm, and the ﬂow is laminar. Determine the pressure gradient required to pro- duce zero net ﬂow at a cross section. 8.24 Two immiscible ﬂuids are contained between inﬁnite parallel plates. The plates are separated by distance 2 h, and the two ﬂuid layers are of equal thickness h55 mm. The dynamic viscosity of the upper ﬂuid is four times that ofthe lower ﬂuid, which is μ lower50.1 N /C1s/m2. If the plates are stationary and the applied pressure gradient is 250 kPa/m, ﬁnd the velocity at the interface. What is the maximumvelocity of the ﬂow? Plot the velocity distribution. 8.25 Two immiscible ﬂuids are contained between inﬁnite parallel plates. The plates are separated by distance 2 h, and the two ﬂuid layers are of equal thickness h; the dynamic viscosity of the upper ﬂuid is three times that of the lowerﬂuid. If the lower plate is stationary and the upper plate moves at constant speed U520 ft =s, what is the velocity at the interface? Assume laminar ﬂows, and that the pressure gradient in the direction of ﬂow is zero. 8.26 The record-read head for a computer disk-drive memory storage system rides above the spinning disk on avery thin ﬁlm of air (the ﬁlm thickness is 0.25 μm). The head location is 25 mm from the disk centerline; the disk spins at8500 rpm. The record-read head is 5 mm square. For stan- dard air in the gap between the head and disk, determine (a) the Reynolds number of the ﬂow, (b) the viscous shearstress, and (c) the power required to overcome viscous shear. 8.27 The dimensionless velocity proﬁle for fully developed laminar ﬂow between inﬁnite parallel plates with the upperplate moving at constant speed Uis shown in Fig. 8 .6. Find the pressure gradient @p/@xat which (a) the upper plate andProblems 405(b) the lower plate experience zero shear stress, in terms of U,a, and μ. Plot the dimensionless velocity proﬁles for these cases. 8.28 Consider steady, fully developed laminar ﬂow of a viscous liquid down an inclined surface. The liquid layer is ofconstant thickness, h. Use a suitably chosen differential control volume to obtain the velocity proﬁle. Develop an expression for the volume ﬂow rate. 8.29 Consider steady, incompressible, and fully developed laminar ﬂow of a viscous liquid down an incline with no pressure gradient. The velocity proﬁle was derived in Example 5.9. Plot the velocity proﬁle. Calculate the kine- matic viscosity of the liquid if the ﬁlm thickness on a 30/C14 slope is 0.8 mm and the maximum velocity is 15.7 mm/s. 8.30 Two immiscible ﬂuids of equal density are ﬂowing down a surface inclined at a 60/C14angle. The two ﬂuid layers are of equal thickness h510 mm; the kinematic viscosity of the upper ﬂuid is 1/5th that of the lower ﬂuid, which is νlower5 0.01 m2/s. Find the velocity at the interface and the velocity at the free surface. Plot the velocity distribution. 8.31 The velocity distribution for ﬂow of a thin viscous ﬁlm down an inclined plane surface was developed in Example5.9.

Determine the ﬂow rate per unit depth for the case of zero pressure gradient. If the ﬂuidis air, evaluate the shear stress on the lower plate and plot the shear stress distribution across the channel for the zero pressure gradient case. Will the ﬂow rate increase ordecrease if the pressure gradient is adverse? Determine the pressure gradient that will give zero shear stress at y50.25a. Plot the shear stress distribution across the channel for the latter case. 8.33 Glycerin at 59/C14F ﬂows between parallel plates with gap width b50.1 in.

Assume U51.5 m/s and a55 mm. Find the pressure gradient for which there is no net ﬂow in the xdirection. Plot the expected velocity distribution and the expected shear stress distribution across the channel for this ﬂow. For the case where u51/2Uaty/a50.5, plot the expected velocity distribution and shear stress distributionacross the channel. Comment on features of the plots. 8.35 The velocity proﬁle for fully developed ﬂow of carbon tetrachloride at 68/C14F between parallel plates (gap a5 0.05 in.), with the upper plate moving, is given by Eq. 8.8. Assuming a volume ﬂow rate per unit depth is 1.5 gpm/ft forzero pressure gradient, ﬁnd U. Evaluate the shear stress on the lower plate. Would the volume ﬂow rate increase or decrease with a mild adverse pressure gradient? Calculate the pressure gradient that will give zero shear stress aty/a50.25. Plot the velocity distribution and the shear stress distribution for this case. 8.36 Free-surface waves begin to form on a laminar liquid ﬁlm ﬂowing down an inclined surface whenever the Rey-nolds number, based on mass ﬂow per unit width of ﬁlm, is larger than about 33. Estimate the maximum thickness of a laminar ﬁlm of water that remains free from waves whileﬂowing down a vertical surface. 8.37 Microchips are supported on a thin air ﬁlm on a smooth horizontal surface during one stage of the manufacturing process. The chips are 11.7 mm long and 9.35 mm wide and have a mass of 0.325 g. The air ﬁlm is 0.125 mm thick. Theinitial speed of a chip is V 051:75 mm =s; the chip slows as the result of viscous shear in the air ﬁlm.

Plotthe variation of chip speed versus time during deceleration.Explain why it looks as you have plotted it. 8.38 A viscous-shear pump is made from a stationary housing with a close-ﬁtting rotating drum inside. The clear-ance is small compared with the diameter of the drum, soﬂow in the annular space may be treated as ﬂow betweenparallel plates. Fluid is dragged around the annulus by vis- cous forces. Evaluate the performance characteristics of the shear pump (pressure differential, input power, and efﬁ-ciency) as functions of volume ﬂow rate. Assume that the depth normal to the diagram is b.

Power is required both to pump the oil and to overcome viscous dissipation in the annular gap. Develop expressions in terms of the speciﬁed geometry for the pump power, 3p, and the viscous dissipation power, 3v.

Plot the efﬁciency versus dimen- sionless ﬂow rate, and ﬁnd the ﬂow rate for maximum efﬁ- ciency. Explain why the efﬁciency peaks, and why it is zero at certain values of q. 8.41 Automotive design is tending toward all-wheel drive to improve vehicle performance and safety when traction is poor. An all-wheel drive vehicle must have an interaxle differential to allow operation on dry roads. Numerousvehicles are being built using multiplate viscous drives forinteraxle differentials. Perform the analysis and design needed to deﬁne the torque transmitted by the differential for a given speed difference, in terms of the design para-meters. Identify suitable dimensions for a viscous differential to transmit a torque of 150 N /C1m at a speed loss of 125 rpm, using lubricant with the properties of SAE 30 oil. Discuss how to ﬁnd the minimum material cost for the viscous dif- ferential, if the plate cost per square meter is constant. 8.42 An inventor proposes to make a “viscous timer” by placing a weighted cylinder inside a slightly larger cylinder containing viscous liquid, creating a narrow annular gap close to the wall. Analyze the ﬂow ﬁeld created when the apparatus is inverted and the mass begins to fall undergravity. Would this system make a satisfactory timer? If so,for what range of time intervals? What would be the effect of a temperature change on measured time? 8.43 A journal bearing consists of a shaft of diameter D535 mm and length L550 mm (moment of inertia I50.125 kg/C1m2) installed symmetrically in a stationary housing such that the annular gap is δ51 mm. The ﬂuid in the gap has viscosity μ50.1 N /C1s/m2. If the shaft is given an initial angular velocity of ω5500 rpm, determine the time for the shaft to slow to 100 rpm. On another day, an unknown ﬂuid is tested in the same way, but takes 10 minutes to slow from500 to 100 rpm. What is its viscosity? 8.44 In Example 8.3 we derived the velocity proﬁle for laminar ﬂow on a vertical wall by using a differential controlvolume. Instead, following the procedure we used inExample 5.9, derive the velocity proﬁle by starting with theNavier /C0Stokes equations (Eqs. 5.27). Be sure to state all assumptions. 8.45 A continuous belt, passing upward through a chemical bath at speed U0, picks up a liquid ﬁlm of thickness h, density ρ, and viscosity μ. Gravity tends to make the liquid drain down, but the movement of the belt keeps the liquid fromrunning off completely. Assume that the ﬂow is fully devel-oped and laminar with zero pressure gradient, and that the atmosphere produces no shear stress at the outer surface of the ﬁlm. State clearly the boundary conditions to be satisﬁedby the velocity at y50 and y5h. Obtain an expression for the velocity proﬁle.8.46 A wet paint ﬁlm of uniform thickness, δ, is painted on a vertical wall. The wet paint can be approximated as a Bingham ﬂuid with a yield stress, τy, and density, ρ. Derive an expression for the maximum value of δthat can be sus- tained without having the paint ﬂow down the wall. Calculatethe maximum thickness for lithographic ink whose yield stress τ y540 Pa and density is approximately 1000 kg/m3. 8.47 When dealing with the lubrication of bearings, the governing equation describing pressure is the Reynolds equation, generally written in 1D as d dxh3 μdp dx/C18/C19 þ6Udh dx¼0 where his the step height and Uis the velocity of the lower surface. Step bearings have a relatively simple design and are used with low-viscosity ﬂuids such as water, gasoline, andsolvents. The minimum ﬁlm thickness in these applications is quite small. The step height must be small enough for good load capacity, yet large enough for the bearing to accom-modate some wear without losing its load capacity by becoming smooth and ﬂat. Beginning with the 1D equation for ﬂuid motion in the xdirection, show that the pressure distribution in the step bearing is as shown, where p s¼6μðh2/C0h1Þ h3 1 L1þh3 2 L2 L1 L1L2 h1h2pS Up x P8.47 Laminar Flow in a Pipe 8.48 Consider ﬁrst water and then SAE 10W lubricating oil ﬂowing at 40/C14C in a 6-mm-diameter tube.

A.3 in Appendix A for the viscosity of water, ﬁnd the viscosity at 220/C14C and 120/C14C. Plot the viscosity over this range. Find the maximum laminar ﬂow rate (L/hr) in a7.5-mm-diameter tube at these temperatures. Plot the max- imum laminar ﬂow rate over this temperature range. 8.51 A hypodermic needle, with inside diameter d50:005 in. and length L51 in., is used to inject saline solution with viscosity ﬁve times that of water. The plunger diameter is D50:375 in.; the maximum force that can be exerted by a thumb on the plunger is F57:5 lbf. Estimate the volume ﬂow rate of saline that can be produced. 8.52 In engineering science, there are often analogies to be made between disparate phenomena. For example, the applied pressure difference, Δp, and corresponding volume ﬂow rate, Q, in a tube can be compared to the applied DC voltage, V, across and current, I, through an electrical resistor, respectively. By analogy, ﬁnd a formula for the“resistance” of laminar ﬂow of ﬂuid of viscosity, μ, in a tube length of Land diameter D, corresponding to electrical resistance, R. For a tube 250 mm long with inside diameter 7.5 mm, ﬁnd the maximum ﬂow rate and pressure differencefor which this analogy will hold for (a) kerosene and (b) castor oil (both at 40 /C14C). When the ﬂow exceeds this maximum, why does the analogy fail? 8.53 Consider fully developed laminar ﬂow in the annulus between two concentric pipes.

The Casson relationship approaches Newtonian behavior at high values of deformation rate. Derive the velocity proﬁle of steady fully developed blood ﬂow in an artery of radius R. Deter- mine the ﬂow rate in the blood vessel. Calculate the ﬂow rate due to a pressure gradient dp/dx52100 Pa/m, in an artery of radius R51 mm, using the following blood data: μ53.5 cP, τc50.05 dynes/cm2. 8.61 Using Eq. 2.16, derive the velocity proﬁle, ﬂow rate, and average velocity of a non-Newtonian ﬂuid in a circular tube. For a ﬂow rate of Q51μL/min and R51 mm, with khaving a value of unity in standard SI units, compare the required pressure gradients for n50.5, 1.0, and l.5. Which ﬂuid requires the smallest pump for the same pipe length? 8.62 The classic Poiseuille ﬂow (Eq. 8.12), is for no-slip conditions at the walls. If the ﬂuid is a gas, and when themean free path, l(the average distance a molecule travels before collision with another molecule), is comparable to the length-scale Lof the ﬂow, slip will occur at the walls, and the ﬂow rate and velocity will be increased for a given pressure gradient. In Eq. 8.11, c 1will still be zero, but c2must satisfy the slip condition u¼l@u=@ratr5R. Derive the velocity proﬁle and ﬂow rate of gas ﬂow in a micro- ornanotube which has such a slip velocity on the wall.

The center of the ellipse is ( y,z)5(0, 0), and the major axis of length aand the minor axis of length bare parallel to the yaxis and zaxes, respectively. The axial pressure gradient, @p/@x, is constant. Based on the Navier/C0 Stokes equations, determine the maximum velocity u 0in terms of a,b, viscosity μ, and @p/@x. Letting ( ρ,φ) be the radial and azimuthal polar coordinates, respectively, of a unit disk (0 #ρ#1 and 0 #φ#2π), the coordinates ( y,z) and the velocity u(y,z) can be expressed as functions of ( ρ,φ): yðρ;φÞ¼aρcosφ zðρ;φÞ¼bρsinφ uðρ;φÞ¼u0ð1/C0ρ2Þ The ﬂow rate is Q¼Ruðy;zÞdydz ¼abR2π 0R1 0ρuðρ;φÞdρdφ.

Based on the calculated hydraulic resistance, which shape is the most energy efﬁcient to pump water? 8.65 In a food industry plant, two immiscible ﬂuids are pumped through a tube such that ﬂuid 1 ( μ150.5 N /C1s/m2) forms an inner core and ﬂuid 2 ( μ255N/C1s/m2) forms an outer annulus. The tube has D55 mm diameter and length L55 m. Derive and plot the velocity distribution if the applied pressure difference, Δp, is 5 MPa. 8.66 A horizontal pipe carries ﬂuid in fully developed tur- bulent ﬂow. The static pressure difference measured between two sections is 750 psi. The distance between the sections is 15 ft, and the pipe diameter is 3 in. Calculatethe shear stress, τ w, that acts on the walls. 8.67 One end of a horizontal pipe is attached using glue to a pressurized tank containing liquid, and the other has a capattached. The inside diameter of the pipe is 3 in., and thetank pressure is 30 psig. Find the force the glue must with-stand with the cap on, and the force it must withstand when the cap is off and the liquid is discharging to atmosphere. 8.68 Kerosene is pumped through a smooth tube with inside diameter D530 mm at close to the critical Reynolds number. The ﬂow is unstable and ﬂuctuates between laminarand turbulent states, causing the pressure gradient to intermittently change from approximately 24.5 kPa/m to 211 kPa/m. Which pressure gradient corresponds to laminar, and which to turbulent, ﬂow? For each ﬂow, compute the shear stress at the tube wall, and sketch the shear stressdistributions. 8.69 The pressure drop between two taps separated in the streamwise direction by 30 ft in a horizontal, fullydeveloped channel ﬂow of water is 1 psi. The cross section ofthe channel is a 1 in :39 1 2in. rectangle. Calculate the aver- age wall shear stress. 8.70 A liquid drug, with the viscosity and density of water, is to be administered through a hypodermic needle. The inside diameter of the needle is 0.25 mm and its length is 50 mm.Determine (a) the maximum volumeﬂow ratefor which the ﬂow will be laminar, (b) the pressure drop required to deliver the maximum ﬂow rate, and (c) the corresponding wall shear stress. 8.71 The “pitch-drop” experiment has been running con- tinuously at the University of Queensland since 1927 (http:// www.physics.uq.edu.au/physi cs_museum/pitchdrop.shtml). In this experiment, a funnel pitch is being used to measure the viscosity of pitch. Flow averages at about one drop—per decade! Viscosity is calculated using the volume ﬂow rate equation Q¼V--- t¼πD4ρg 128μ1þh L/C18/C19 where Dis the diameter of the ﬂow from the funnel, his the depth to the pitch in the main body of the funnel, Lis the length of the funnel stem, and tis the elapsed time. Compare this equation with Eq. 8.13c using hydrostatic force instead of a pressure gradient. After the 6th drop in 1979, they measured that it took 17,708 days for 4.7 31025m3of pitch to fall. Given the measurements D59.4 mm, h575 mm,L529 mm, and ρpitch51.13103kg/m3, what is the viscosity of the pitch?

Energy Considerations in Pipe Flow 8.76 Consider fully developed laminar ﬂow of water between stationary parallel plates. The maximum ﬂow speed, platespacing, and width are 20 ft/s, 0.075 in. and 1.25 in., respec- tively. Find the kinetic energy coefﬁcient, α. 8.77 Consider fully developed laminar ﬂow in a circular tube. Evaluate the kinetic energy coefﬁcient for this ﬂow. 8.78 Show that the kinetic energy coefﬁcient, α, for the “power law” turbulent velocity proﬁle of Eq. 8.22 is given by Eq. 8.27.410 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous FlowPlot αas a function of ReV,f o r ReV513104to 13107. When analyzing pipe ﬂow problems it is common practice to assume α/C251. Plot the error associated with this assumption as a function of ReV,f o r ReV513104to 13107. 8.79 Measurements are made for the ﬂow conﬁguration shown in Fig. 8.12 . At the inlet, section 1, the pressure is 70 kPa (gage), the average velocity is 1.75 m/s, and the ele- vation is 2.25 m. At the outlet, section 2, the pressure, average velocity, and elevation are 45 kPa (gage), 3.5 m/s, and 3 m, respectively. Calculate the head loss in meters. Convert to units of energy per unit mass. 8.80 Water ﬂows in a horizontal constant-area pipe; the pipe diameter is 75 mm and the average ﬂow speed is 5 m/s. At the pipe inlet, the gage pressure is 275 kPa, and the outlet is at atmospheric pressure. Determine the head loss in the pipe. If the pipe is now aligned so that the outlet is 15 m above theinlet, what will the inlet pressure need to be to maintainthe same ﬂow rate? If the pipe is now aligned so that the outlet is 15 m below the inlet, what will the inlet pressure need to be to maintain the same ﬂow rate? Finally, howmuch lower than the inlet must the outlet be so that the same ﬂow rate is maintained if both ends of the pipe are at atmospheric pressure (i.e., gravity feed)? 8.81 For the ﬂow conﬁguration of Fig. 8.12, it is known that the head loss is 1 m. The pressure drop from inlet to outlet is 50 kPa, the velocity doubles from inlet to outlet, and the elevation increase is 2 m. Compute the inlet water velocity. Calculation of Head Loss 8.82 For a given volume ﬂow rate and piping system, will the pressure loss be greater for hot water or cold water? Explain. 8.83 Consider the pipe ﬂow from the water tower of Example 8.7. After another 5 years the pipe roughness hasincreased such that the ﬂow is fully turbulent and f50.035. Find by how much the ﬂow rate is decreased. 8.84 Consider the pipe ﬂow from the water tower of Prob- lem 8.83. To increase delivery, the pipe length is reducedfrom 600 ft to 450 ft (the ﬂow is still fully turbulent andf50.035). What is the ﬂow rate? 8.85 Water ﬂows from a horizontal tube into a large tank. The tube is located 2.5 m below the free surface of water inthe tank. The head loss is 2 J/kg. Compute the average ﬂowspeed in the tube. 8.86 The average ﬂow speed in a constant-diameter section of the Alaskan pipeline is 2.5 m/s. At the inlet, the pressure is8.25 MPa (gage) and the elevation is 45 m; at the outlet, thepressure is 350 kPa (gage) and the elevation is 115 m. Cal- culate the head loss in this section of pipeline. 8.87 At the inlet to a constant-diameter section of the Alaskan pipeline, the pressure is 8.5 MPa and the elevation is 45 m; at the outlet the elevation is 115 m. The head loss in this section of pipeline is 6.9 kJ/kg. Calculate the outlet pressure. 8.88 Water ﬂows at 10 L/min through a horizontal 15-mm- diameter tube. The pressure drop along a 20-m length oftube is 85 kPa. Calculate the head loss. 8.89 Laufer [5] measured the following data for mean velocity near the wall in fully developed turbulent pipe ﬂowatRe U550;000ðU59:8f t=s and R54:86 in :Þin air: u=U0.343 0.318 0.300 0.264 0.228 0.221 0.179 0.152 0.140 y=R 0.0082 0.0075 0.0071 0.0061 0.0055 0.0051 0.0041 0.0034 0.0030 Plot the data and obtain the best-ﬁt slope, du=dy.

Compare this value to that obtained using the friction factor fcom- puted using (a) the Colebrook formula (Eq. 8.37), and (b) the Blasius correlation (Eq. 8.38). 8.90 Water is pumped at the rate of 0.075 m3/s from a reservoir 20 m above a pump to a free discharge 35 m above the pump. The pressure on the intake side of the pump is 150 kPa and the pressure on the discharge side is 450 kPa. All pipes are commercial steel of 15 cm diameter.

When the mass ﬂow rate is 0.075 kg/s, the pressure drop is measured to be 7.5 Pa per 100 m of pipe. Based on these measurements, what is the friction factor? What is the Reynolds number? Does this Reynolds numbergenerally indicate laminar or turbulent ﬂow? Is the ﬂowactually laminar or turbulent? 8.92 A small-diameter capillary tube made from drawn aluminum is used in place of an expansion valve in a homerefrigerator. The inside diameter is 0.5 mm. Calculate thecorresponding relative roughness. Comment on whether this tube may be considered “smooth” with regard to ﬂuid ﬂow. 8.93 The Colebrook equation (Eq. 8.37) for computing the turbulent friction factor is implicit in f.

If the pressure before the con- traction is 500 kPa, estimate the pressure after the contraction. Recompute the answer if the included angle is changed to 180/C14(a sudden contraction). 8.98 Water ﬂows through a 25-mm-diameter tube that suddenly enlarges to a diameter of 50 mm. The ﬂow rate through the enlargement is 1.25 Liter/s. Calculate the pres- sure rise across the enlargement. Compare with the value for frictionless ﬂow. 8.99 Water ﬂows through a 2-in.-diameter tube that sud- denly contracts to 1 in. diameter. The pressure drop across the contraction is 0.5 psi. Determine the volume ﬂow rate. 8.100 Air at standard conditions ﬂows through a sudden expansion in a circular duct. The upstream and downstream duct diameters are 75 mm and 225 mm, respectively. The pressure downstream is 5 mm of water higher than that upstream. Determine the average speed of the air approaching the expansion and the volume ﬂow rate. 8.101 In an undergraduate laboratory, you have been assigned the task of developing a crude ﬂow meter for measuring the ﬂow in a 45-mm-diameter water pipe system. You are to install a 22.5-mm-diameter section of pipe and a water manometer to measure the pressure drop at the sud- den contraction. Derive an expression for the theoretical calibration constant kinQ¼kﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Δhp , where Qis the volume ﬂow rate in L/min, and Δhis the manometer deﬂection in mm. Plot the theoretical calibration curve for a ﬂow rate range of 10 to 50 L/min. Would you expect this to be a practical device for measuring ﬂow rate? 8.102 Water ﬂows from a larger pipe, diameter D15100 mm, into a smaller one, diameter D2550 mm, by way of a reentrant device. Find the head loss between points 1and 2. 8.103 Flow through a sudden contraction is shown. The minimum ﬂow area at the vena contracta is given in terms of the area ratio by the contraction coefﬁcient [32], Cc5Ac A250:6210:38A2 A1/C18/C193 The loss in a sudden contraction is mostly a result of the vena contracta: The ﬂuid accelerates into the contraction, there is ﬂow separation (as shown by the dashed lines), and the vena contracta acts as a miniature sudden expansion with sig- niﬁcant secondary ﬂow losses. Use these assumptions to obtain and plot estimates of the minor loss coefﬁcient for a sudden contraction, and compare with the data presented in Fig. 8.15 . A1 A2 AcFlow P8.103 8.104 Water ﬂows from the tank shown through a very short pipe. Assume the ﬂow is quasi-steady. Estimate the ﬂow rate at the instant shown.

Using the given conditions, calculate the minor head loss coefﬁcient for the elbow. 8.106 Air ﬂows out of a clean room test chamber through a 150-mm-diameter duct of length L. The original duct had a square edged entrance, but this has been replaced with a well-rounded one. The pressure in the chamber is 2.5 mm of water above ambient. Losses from friction are negligible compared with the entrance and exit losses. Estimate the increase in volume ﬂow rate that results from the change in entrance contour.D1 D21 2 P8.102412 Chapter 8Internal Incompressible Viscous Flow8.107 A water tank (open to the atmosphere) contains water to a depth of 5 m. A 25-mm-diameter hole is punched in the bottom. Modeling the hole as square-edged, estimate the ﬂow rate (L/s) exiting the tank. If you were to stick a short section of pipe into the hole, by how much would the ﬂowrate change? If instead you were to machine the inside of the hole to give it a rounded edge (r 55 mm), by how much would the ﬂow rate change? 8.108 A conical diffuser is used to expand a pipe ﬂow from a diameter of 100 mm to a diameter of 150 mm. Find the minimum length of the diffuser if we want a loss coefﬁcient (a)Kdiffuser#0:2, (b) Kdiffuser#0:35. 8.109 A conical diffuser of length 6 in. is used to expand a pipe ﬂow from a diameter of 2 in. to a diameter of 3.5 in. For a water ﬂow rate of 750 gal/min, estimate the static pressure rise. What is the approximate value of the loss coefﬁcient? 8.110 Space has been found for a conical diffuser 0.45 m long in the clean room ventilation system described inProblem 8.106. The best diffuser of this size is to be used. Assume that data from Fig. 8.16 may be used. Determine the appropriate diffuser angle and area ratio for this installation and estimate the volume ﬂow rate that will be delivered after it is installed. 8.111 By applying the basic equations to a control volume starting at the expansion and ending downstream, analyze ﬂow through a sudden expansion (assume the inlet pressure p1acts on the area A2at the expansion). Develop an expression for and plot the minor head loss across the expansion as a function of area ratio, and compare with the data of Fig. 8.15 . 8.112 Water at 45/C14C enters a shower head through a circular tube with 15.8 mm inside diameter. The water leaves in 24 streams, each of 1.05 mm diameter. The volume ﬂow rate is5.67 L/min. Estimate the minimum water pressure needed at the inlet to the shower head. Evaluate the force needed to hold the shower head onto the end of the circular tube.Indicate clearly whether this is a compression or a tension force. 8.113 Analyze ﬂow through a sudden expansion to obtain an expression for the upstream average velocity V1in terms of the pressure change Δp5p22p1, area ratio AR, ﬂuid density ρ, and loss coefﬁcient K. If the ﬂow were frictionless, would the ﬂow rate indicated by a measured pressure change be higher or lower than a real ﬂow, and why? Conversely, if the ﬂow were frictionless, would a given ﬂow generate a larger or smaller pressure change, and why? 8.114 Water discharges to atmosphere from a large reservoir through a moderately rounded horizontal nozzle of 25 mmdiameter. The free surface is 2.5 m above the nozzle exit plane. Calculate the change in ﬂow rate when a short section of 50-mm-diameter pipe is attached to the end of the nozzleto form a sudden expansion. Determine the location and estimate the magnitude of the minimum pressure with the sudden expansion in place. If the ﬂow were frictionless (withthe sudden expansion in place), would the minimum pressure be higher, lower, or the same? Would the ﬂow rate be higher, lower, or the same?8.115 Water ﬂows steadily from a large tank through a length of smooth plastic tubing, then discharges to atmosphere. Thetubing inside diameter is 3.18 mm, and its length is 15.3 m. Calculate the maximum volume ﬂow rate for which ﬂow in the tubing will remain laminar. Estimate the water levelin the tank below which ﬂow will be laminar (for laminar ﬂow, α52 and K ent51:4). 8.116 You are asked to compare the behavior of fully developed laminar ﬂow and fully developed turbulent ﬂow in a horizontal pipe under different conditions. For the same ﬂow rate, which will have the larger centerline velocity? Why? If the pipe discharges to atmosphere, what would youexpect the trajectory of the discharge stream to look like (for the same ﬂow rate)? Sketch your expectations for each case. For the same ﬂow rate, which ﬂow would give the larger wallshear stress? Why? Sketch the shear stress distribution τ/τ w as a function of radius for each ﬂow. For the same Reynolds number, which ﬂow would have the larger pressure drop per unit length? Why? For a given imposed pressure differential,which ﬂow would have the larger ﬂow rate? Why? Most of the remaining problems in this chapter involve deter-mination of the turbulent friction factor ffrom the Reynolds number Reand dimensionless roughness e/D. For approximate calculations, fc a nb er e a df r o mF i g . 8.13; a more accurate approach is to use this value (or some other value, even f51) as the ﬁrst value for iterating in Eq. 8.37. The most convenientapproach is to use solution of Eq. 8.37 programmed into (orbuilt-into) your calculator, or programmed into an Excel workbook. Hence, most of the remaining problems beneﬁt from use of Excel . To avoid needless duplication, the computer symbol will only be used next to remaining problems in this chapter when it has an additional beneﬁt (e.g., for iterating to a solution, or for graphing). 8.117 Estimate the minimum level in the water tank of Problem 8.115 such that the ﬂow will be turbulent. 8.118 A laboratory experiment is set up to measure pressure drop for ﬂow of water through a smooth tube. The tube diameter is 15.9 mm, and its length is 3.56 m. Flow enters the tube from a reservoir through a square-edged entrance.Calculate the volume ﬂow rate needed to obtain turbulent ﬂow in the tube. Evaluate the reservoir height differential required to obtain turbulent ﬂow in the tube. 8.119 A benchtop experiment consists of a reservoir with a 500-mm-long horizontal tube of diameter 7.5 mm attached to its base. The tube exits to a sink. A ﬂow of water at 10/C14Ci s to be generated such that the Reynolds number is 10,000. What is the ﬂow rate?

Select tank and tubing dimensions so that the system is compact, but will operate in the transitionzone range. Design the experiment so that you can easily increase the tank head from a low range (laminar ﬂow) through transition to turbulent ﬂow, and vice versa. (Writeinstructions for students on recognizing when the ﬂow is laminar or turbulent.) Generate plots (on the same graph) of tank depth against Reynolds number, assuming laminar orturbulent ﬂow. 8.135 A small swimming pool is drained using a garden hose. The hose has 20 mm inside diameter, a roughness heightof 0.2 mm, and is 30 m long.

Neglect changes in density and any effects of hose curvature. Calculate the longest hose that may be used. 8.140 You recently bought a house and want to improve the ﬂow rate of water on your top ﬂoor. The poor ﬂow rate is dueto three reasons: The city water pressure at the water meteris poor ( p5200 kPa gage); the piping has a small diameter (D51.27 cm) and has been crudded up, increasing its roughness ( e/D50.05); and the top ﬂoor of the house is 15 m higher than the water meter. You are considering two options to improve the ﬂow rate: Option 1 is replacing all the piping after the water meter with new smooth piping with adiameter of 1.9 cm; and option 2 is installing a booster pumpwhile keeping the original pipes. The booster pump has an outlet pressure of 300 kPa. Which option would be more effective?

Two pumping stations at the same elevation are located 13 km apart. The pressure dropbetween the stations is 1.4 MPa. The pipeline is made from 0.6-m-diameter pipe. Although the pipe is made from com- mercial steel, age and corrosion have raised the piperoughness to approximately that for galvanized iron.

Plot the ﬂow rate against tube relative roughness e/Dfore/Dranging from 0 to 0.05 (this could be replicated experimentally by progressively rougheningthe tube surface).

Plot the ﬂow rate against tube length for ﬂow ranging from low speed laminar to fully turbulent. 8.151 For the pipe ﬂow into a reservoir of Example 8.5 consider the effect of pipe roughness on ﬂow rate, assumingthe pressure of the pump is maintained at 153 kPa. Plot the ﬂow rate against pipe roughness ranging from smooth ( e50) to very rough ( e53.75 mm). Also consider the effect of pipe length (again assuming the pump always produces 153 kPa) for smooth pipe. Plot the ﬂow rate against pipe length for L5100 m through L51000 m. 8.152 Water for a ﬁre protection system is supplied from a water tower through a 150-mm cast-iron pipe.

Assume that the 50 ft length of horizontal constant-diameter pipe required by law has been installed. The relative roughness of the pipe is 0.01. Estimate the ﬂow rate of water delivered by the pipe under the inlet conditionsof the example. What would be the effect of adding the same diffuser to the end of the 50 ft pipe? 8.158 You are watering your lawn with an oldhose. Because lime deposits have built up over the years, the 0.75-in.-i.d. hose now has an average roughness height of 0.022 in. One 50-ft length of the hose, attached to your spigot, delivers 15 gpm of water (60/C14F). Compute the pressure at the spigot, in psi. Estimate the delivery if two 50-ft lengths of the hose are connected. Assume that the pressure at the spigot varies with ﬂow rate and the water main pressure remains constantat 50 psig. 8.159 In Example 8.10 we found that the ﬂow rate from a water main could be increased (by as much as 33 percent) by attaching a diffuser to the outlet of the nozzle installed into the water main. We read that the Roman watercommissioner required that the tube attached to the noz- zle of each customer’s pipe be the same diameter for at least 50 feet from the public water main. Was the com-missioner overly conservative? Using the data of the problem, estimate the length of pipe (with e/D50.01) at which the system of pipe and diffuser would give a ﬂow rate equal to that with the nozzle alone. Plot the volumeﬂow ratio Q/Q ias a function of L/D,w h e r e Lis the length of pipe between the nozzle and the diffuser, Qiis the volume ﬂow rate for the nozzle alone, and Qis the actual volume ﬂow rate with the pipe inserted between nozzle and diffuser. 8.160 Your boss, from the “old school,” claims that for pipe ﬂow the ﬂow rate, Q~ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Δpp , where Δpis the pressure dif- ference driving the ﬂow. You dispute this, so perform some calculations. You take a 1-in.-diameter commercial steel pipe and assume an initial ﬂow rate of 1.25 gal/min of water.

The ﬂow over a sphere (Fig. 2.14b) and the ﬂow over a streamlined body (Fig. 2.16) are examples of external ﬂows, which were discussed qualitatively in Chapter 2. More interestingexamples are the ﬂow ﬁelds around such objects as airfoils (Fig. 9.1), automobiles, andairplanes. Our objective in this chapter is to quantify the behavior of viscous, incompressible ﬂuids in external ﬂow. A number of phenomena that occur in exter nal ﬂow over a body are illustrated in the sketch of viscous ﬂow at high Reynolds number over an airfoil (Fig. 9.1). The freestream ﬂow divides at the stagnation point and ﬂows around the body. Fluid at the surface takes on the velocity of the body as a result of the no-slip condition. Boundary layers form on boththe upper and lower surfaces of the body. (The boundary-layer thickness on both surfaces inFig. 9.1 is exaggerated greatly for clarity.) The ﬂow in the boundary layers initially isCase Study in Energy and the Environment Wind Power: The Magenn Air Rotor System (MARS) In Chapter 8’s Case Study in Energy and the Environment , we looked at an alternative to the three- bladed wind turbine farms that are cropping up all overthe world. In this Case Study we look at a second unique idea for wind power, the Magenn Air Rotor System (MARS). Magenn Power is a company that’s been in business several decades and that began designing theMagnus Spherical Airship in 1978. The founder of Magenn Power, Fred Ferguson, patented the MagnusAirship in the 1980s. This unique airship generates extralift due to the Magnus effect. We will discuss the Mag-nus effect in this chapter, but for now we simply statethat the effect is one in which a lift force is generatedwhenever a sphere or cylinder rotates in a cross ﬂow;the classic example is in golf, where a ball hit withbackspin will travel much further due to the lift gener- ated by the spin. The airship was a large spherical envelope ﬁlled with helium to achieve static, buoyantlift. It was designed to rotate as it moved so thatMagnus lift was generated. With Magnus lift, as we’lllearn in this chapter, the faster the spin or the vehicle’sforward motion, the larger the Magnus lift. TheMARS shown in the rendering is a high-altitude lighter-than-air, tethered device that rotates about a horizontal axis in response to wind; it is essentially a horizontal-axis Savonius type of wind turbine (see Figure P9.97 in the problem set). Buoyancy is providedby the helium contained in the device, but its rotationalso generates lift via the Magnus effect. The extra liftallows the device to be stabilized in ﬂight, keeping itprecisely located, and prevents downwind drift on itstether; the stronger the wind is, the greater the Magnus lift. Rotation of the MARS drives a generator inside the device, and the electrical power travels down the tether to a transformer at a ground station.The MARS has a number of advantages over con- ventional three-blade wind turbines. Magenn Powerbelieves it will develop power less expensively and willhave time-averaged output much closer to its ratedcapacity than the capacity factor typical with conven-tional designs; it is also operable over a wide range ofwind speeds (2 m/s to greater than about 30 m/s).It’s thought the efﬁciency will be 25 to 60 percent. MARS wind farms could be placed closer to demand centers than conventional wind turbines, reducing power transmission line initial costs and operationlosses. The devices can be raised to a high altitude,where the winds are stronger; altitudes from about100 m to about 300 m above ground level are possible,without having to build expensive infrastructure. MARS are mobile, and could be very useful in emergency situations and in disaster relief. The 10 to 25 kW pro- totype shown in the ﬁgure is now undergoing tests. An example of the MARS device (Picture courtesy of Magenn Power)422 Chapter 9External Incompressible Viscous Flowlaminar. Transition to turbulent ﬂow occurs at some distance from the stagnation point, depending on freestream conditions, surfac e roughness, and pressure gradient. The transition points are indicated by “T” in the ﬁgure. The turbulent boundary layer fol- lowing transition grows more rapidly than the laminar layer. A slight displacement of the streamlines of the external ﬂow is caused by the thickening boundary layers on the sur- face. In a region of increasing pressure (an adverse pressure gradient — s oc a l l e db e c a u s ei t opposes the ﬂuid motion, tending to decelera te the ﬂuid particles) ﬂow separation may occur. Separation points are indicated by “S” in the ﬁgure. Fluid that was in the boundarylayers on the body surface forms the visc ous wake behind the separation points. This chapter has two parts. Part A is a review of boundary-layer ﬂows. Here we discuss in a little more detail the ideas introduced in Chapter 2, and then apply the ﬂuid mechanics concepts we have learned to analyze the boundary layer for ﬂow along a ﬂat plate—the simplest possible boundary layer, because the pressure ﬁeld is constant. We will beinterested in seeing how the boundary-layer thickness grows, what the surface frictionwill be, and so on. We will explore a classic analytical solution for a laminar boundary layer, and see that we need to resort to approximate methods when the boundary layer is turbulent (and we will also be able to use these approximate methods for laminar boundary layers, to avoid using the somewhat difﬁcult analytical method). This willconclude our introduction to boundary layers, except we will brieﬂy discuss the effect of pressure gradients (present for allbody shapes except ﬂat plates) on boundary-layer behavior. In Part B we will discuss the force on a submerged body, such as the airfoil of Fig.9.1. We will see that this force results from both shear and pressure forces acting on the body surface, and that both of these are profoundly affected by the fact that we have a boundary layer, especially when this causes ﬂow separation and a wake.Traditionally the force a body experiences is decomposed into the component parallelto the ﬂow, the drag, and the component perpendicular to the ﬂow, the lift. Because most bodies do have a point of separation and a wake, it is difﬁcult to use analysis todetermine the force components, so we will present approximate analyses andexperimental data for various interesting body shapes. Part A Boundary Layers 9.1 The Boundary-Layer Concept The concept of a boundary layer was ﬁrst introduced by Ludwig Prandtl [1], a Germanaerodynamicist, in 1904.LBL LBL TBLTBL T TS SViscous wakeStreamlines Stagnation pointU–Uniform velocity field upstream LBL– Laminar boundary layer TBL– Turbulent boundary layer T– Transition S– Separation pointAirfoil Fig. 9.1 Details of viscous ﬂow around an airfoil. VIDEO Flow around an Airfoil. VIDEO Flow Separation on an Airfoil. 9.1The Boundary-Layer Concept 423Prior to Prandtl’s historic breakthrough, the science of ﬂuid mechanics had been developing in two rather different directions. Theoretical hydrodynamics evolved from Euler’s equation of motion for a nonviscous ﬂuid (Eq. 6.1, published by Leon- hard Euler in 1755). Since the results of hydrodynamics contradicted many experi- mental observations (especially, as we saw in Chapter 6, that under the assumption ofinviscid ﬂow no bodies experience drag!), practicing engineers developed their ownempirical art of hydraulics . This was based on experimental data and differed sig- niﬁcantly from the purely mathematical approach of theoretical hydrodynamics. Although the complete equations describing the motion of a viscous ﬂuid (the Navier /C0Stokes equations, Eqs. 5.26, developed by Navier, 1827, and independently by Stokes, 1845) were known prior to Prandtl, the mathematical difﬁculties in solving these equations (except for a few simple cases) prohibited a theoretical treatment of viscous ﬂows. Prandtl showed [1] that many viscous ﬂows can be analyzed by dividingthe ﬂow into two regions, one close to solid boundaries, the other covering the restof the ﬂow. Only in the thin region adjacent to a solid boundary (the boundary layer)is the effect of viscosity important. In the region outside of the boundary layer, theeffect of viscosity is negligible and the ﬂuid may be treated as inviscid. The boundary-layer concept provided the link that had been missing between theory and practice (for one thing, it introduced the theoretical possibility of drag!). Furthermore, the boundary-layer concept permitted the solution of viscous ﬂow problems that would have been impossible through application of the Navier /C0Stokes equations to the complete ﬂow ﬁeld. 1Thus the introduction of the boundary-layer concept marked the beginning of the modern era of ﬂuid mechanics. The development of a boundary layer on a solid surface was discussed in Section 2.6. In the boundary layer both viscous and inertia forces are important. Consequently, it is notsurprising that the Reynolds number (which represents the ratio of inertia to viscousforces) is signiﬁcant in characterizing boundary-layer ﬂows. The characteristic length used in the Reynolds number is either the length in the ﬂow direction over which the boundary layer has developed or some measure of the boundary-layer thickness. As is true for ﬂow in a duct, ﬂow in a boundary layer may be laminar or turbulent. There is no unique value of Reynolds number at which transition from laminar toturbulent ﬂow occurs in a boundary layer. Among the factors that affect boundary-layer transition are pressure gradient, surface roughness, heat transfer, body forces,and freestream disturbances. Detailed consideration of these effects is beyond thescope of this book. In many real ﬂow situations, a boundary layer develops over a long, essentially ﬂat surface. Examples include ﬂow over ship and submarine hulls, aircraft wings, andatmospheric motions over ﬂat terrain. Since the basic features of all these ﬂowsare illustrated in the simpler case of ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, we consider this ﬁrst.The simplicity of the ﬂow over an inﬁnite ﬂat plate is that the velocity Uoutside the boundary layer is constant, and therefore, because this region is steady, inviscid, andincompressible, the pressure will also be constant. This constant pressure is thepressure felt by the boundary layer—obviously the simplest pressure ﬁeld possible. This is a zero pressure gradient ﬂow . A qualitative picture of the boundary-layer growth over a ﬂat plate is shown in Fig. 9.2. The boundary layer is laminar for a short distance downstream from the leading edge; transition occurs over a region of the plate rather than at a single line across the plate. The transition region extends downstream to the location wherethe boundary-layer ﬂow becomes completely turbulent. For incompressible ﬂow over a smooth ﬂat plate (zero pressure gradient), in the absence of heat transfer, transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow in the boundary layer can be delayed to a Reynolds number, Re x5ρUx/μ, greater than one million if 1Today, computer solutions of the Navier /C0Stokes equations are common.424 Chapter 9External Incompressible Viscous Flowexternal disturbances are minimized. (The length xis measured from the leading edge.) For calculation purposes, under typical ﬂow conditions, transition usually is considered to occur at a length Reynolds number of 500,000. For air at standardconditions, with freestream velocity U530 m/s, this corresponds to x/C250.24 m. In the qualitative picture of Fig. 9.2, we have shown the turbulent boundary layer growing faster than the laminar layer. In later sections of this chapter we shall show that this isindeed true. In the next section we discuss various ways to quantify the thickness of a boundary layer. 9.2 Boundary-Layer Thicknesses The boundary layer is the region adjacent to a solid surface in which viscous stresses arepresent, as opposed to the free stream where viscous stresses are negligible. These stresses are present because we have shearing of the ﬂuid layers, i.e., a velocity gra- dient, in the boundary layer. As indicated in Fig. 9.2, both laminar and turbulent layers have such gradients, but the difﬁculty is that the gradients only asymptoticallyapproach zero as we reach the edge of the boundary layer. Hence, the location of theedge, i.e., of the boundary-layer thickness, is not very obvious—we cannot simplydeﬁne it as where the boundary-layer velocity uequals the freestream velocity U. Because of this, several boundary-layer deﬁnitions have been developed: the dis-turbance thickness δ, the displacement thickness δ*, and the momentum thickness θ. (Each of these increases as we move down the plate, in a manner we have yet todetermine.) The most straightforward deﬁnition is the disturbance thickness, δ. This is usually deﬁned as the distance from the surface at which the velocity is within 1 percent of the free stream, u/C250.99U(as shown in Fig. 9.3b). The other two deﬁnitions are based on the notion that the boundary layer retards the ﬂuid, so that the mass ﬂux and momentum ﬂux are both less than they would be in the absence of the boundary layer.We imagine that the ﬂow remains at uniform velocity U, but the surface of the plate is moved upwards to reduce either the mass or momentum ﬂux by the same amount thatthe boundary layer actually does. The displacement thickness ,δ*, is the distance the plate would be moved so that the loss of mass ﬂux (due to reduction in uniform ﬂowarea) is equivalent to the loss the boundary layer causes. The mass ﬂux if we had noboundary layer would beR N 0ρUd yw , where wis the width of the plate perpendicular to the ﬂow. The actual ﬂow mass ﬂux isRN 0ρud yw . Hence, the loss due to the boundary layer isRN 0ρðU2uÞdy w. If we imagine keeping the velocity at a constant U, and instead move the plate up a distance δ* (as shown in Fig. 9.3 a), the loss of mass ﬂux would be ρUδ*w. Setting these losses equal to one another gives ρUδ*w5ZN 0ρðU2uÞdy wU UU Laminar TransitionTurbulent Fig. 9.2 Boundary layer on a ﬂat plate (vertical thickness exaggerated greatly).

Application of the displacement-thickness concept is illustrated in Example 9.1. Themomentum thickness ,θ, is the distance the plate would be moved so that the loss of momentum ﬂux is equivalent to the loss the boundary layer actually causes. The momentum ﬂux if we had no boundary layer would beRN 0ρuU dy w (the actual mass ﬂux isRN 0ρud yw , and the momentum per unit mass ﬂux of the uniform ﬂow is Uitself). The actual momentum ﬂux of the boundary layer isRN 0ρu2dy w . Hence, the loss of momentum in the boundary layer isRN 0ρuðU2uÞdy w . If we imagine keeping the velocity at a constant U, and instead move the plate up a distance θ(as shown in Fig. 9.3 c), the loss of momentum ﬂux would beRθ 0ρUU dy w 5ρU2θw. Setting these losses equal to one another gives ρU2θ5ZN 0ρuðU2uÞdy and θ5ZN 0u U12u U/C16/C17 dy/C25Zδ 0u U12u U/C16/C17 dy ð9:2Þ Again, the integrand is essentially zero for y$δ. The displacement and momentum thicknesses, δ* and θ, are integral thicknesses , because their deﬁnitions, Eqs. 9.1 and 9.2, are in terms of integrals across theboundary layer. Because they are deﬁned in terms of integrals for which the integrandvanishes in the freestream, they are appreciably easier to evaluate accuratelyfrom experimental data than the boundary-layer disturbance thickness, δ. This fact, coupled with their physical signiﬁcance, accounts for their common use in specifying boundary-layer thickness. We have seen that the velocity proﬁle in the boundary layer merges into the local freestream velocity asymptotically. Little error is introduced if the slight difference between velocities at the edge of the boundary layer is ignored for an approximateanalysis. Simplifying assumptions usually made for engineering analyses of boundary-layer development are: 1.u-Uaty5δ 2.@u/@y-0a ty5δ 3.v{Uwithin the boundary layer(in mass flux)U UU U UU u0.99 U δ∗δ δθ θ(in momentum flux) (a) Displacement thickness, δ*( b) Disturbance thickness, (c) Momentum thickness, Fig. 9.3 Boundary-layer thickness deﬁnitions.426 Chapter 9External Incompressible Viscous FlowResults of the analyses developed in the next two sections show that the boundary layer is very thin compared with its development length along the surface. Therefore it is also reasonable to assume: 4.Pressure variation across the thin boundary layer is negligible. The freestreampressure distribution is impressed on the boundary layer. Example 9.1 BOUNDARY LAYER IN CHANNEL FLOW A laboratory wind tunnel has a test section that is 305 mm square. Boundary-layer velocity proﬁles are measured attwo cross-sections and displacement thicknesses are evaluated from the measured proﬁles. At section 1, where the freestream speed is U1526 m/s, the displacement thickness is δ* 151.5 mm. At section 2, located downstream from section 1,δ* 252.1 mm. Calculate the change in static pressure between sections 1and 2. Express the result as a fraction of the freestream dynamic pressure at section 1. Assume standard atmosphere conditions. Given: Flow of standard air in laboratory wind tunnel. Test section is L5305 mm square. Displacement thick- nesses are δ* 151.5 mm and δ*252.1 mm. Freestream speed is U1526 m/s. Find: Change in static pressure between sections 1and 2. (Express as a fraction of freestream dynamic pressure at section 1.) Solution: The idea here is that at each location the boundary-layer displacement thickness effectively reduces the area ofuniform ﬂow, as indicated in the following ﬁgures: Location 2has a smaller effective ﬂow area than location 1 (because δ* 2.δ*1). Hence, from mass conservation the uniform velocity at location 2will be higher. Finally, from the Bernoulli equation the pressure at location 2will be lower than that at location 1. Apply the continuity and Bernoulli equations to freestream ﬂow outside the boundary-layer displacement thickness, where viscous effects are negligible.

Even this simplest case (i.e., constant freestream velocityUand pressure p, laminar ﬂow) involved a rather subtle mathematical transformation of two differential equations. The solution was based on the insight that the laminarboundary-layer velocity proﬁle is self-similar—only its scale changes as we move alongthe plate. Numerical integration was necessary to obtain results for the boundary-layerthickness δ(x), velocity proﬁle u/Uversus y/δ, and wall shear stress τ w(x). We would like to obtain a method for analyzing the general case—that is, for laminar and turbulent boundary layers, for which the freestream velocity U(x) and pressure p(x) are known functions of position along the surface x(such as on the curved surface of an airfoil or on the ﬂat but divergent surfaces of a ﬂow diffuser).The approach is one in which we will again apply the basic equations to a controlvolume. The derivation, from the mass conservation (or continuity) equation and themomentum equation, will take several pages. Consider incompressible, steady, two-dimensional ﬂow over a solid surface.

Now let us consider the momentum ﬂuxes and forces associated with control volume abcd. These are related by the momentum equation. b.

(For convenience the differential control volume has been redrawn in Fig.9.5.) Note that surfaces ab,bc, and cdall experience normal forces (i.e., pressure) that generate force in the xdirection. In addition, a shear force acts on surface ad. Since, by deﬁnition of the boundary layer, the velocity gradient goes to zero at the edge of the boundary layer, the shear force acting along surface bcis negligible. Surface Force ab If the pressure at xisp, then the force acting on surface abis given by Fab5pwδ [The boundary layer is very thin; its thickness has been greatly exaggerated inall the sketches we have made.

This equation will yield an ordinary differential equation for boundary-layer thickness δas a function of x. Where does δ appear in Eq. 9.17? It appears in the upper limits of the integrals that deﬁne δ* and θ! All we need to do is provide a suitable expression for the velocity proﬁle u/Uand somehow relate the wall stress τwto other variables—not necessarily easy tasks! Once the boundary-layer thickness is determined, expressions for the momentum thickness, displacement thickness, and wall shear stress can then be obtained.432 Chapter 9External Incompressible Viscous FlowEquation 9.17 was obtained by applying the basic equations (continuity and xmomentum) to a differential control volume. Reviewing the assumptions we made in the derivation, we see that the equation is restricted to steady, incompressible, two- dimensional ﬂow with no body forces parallel to the surface. We have not made any speciﬁc assumption relating the wall shear stress, τw, to the velocity ﬁeld. Thus Eq. 9.17 is valid for either a laminar or turbulent boundary-layer ﬂow. In order to use this equation to estimate the boundary-layer thickness as afunction of x, we must ﬁrst: 1.Obtain a ﬁrst approximation to the freestream velocity distribution, U(x). This is determined from inviscid ﬂow theory (the velocity that would exist in the absenceof a boundary layer) and depends on body shape. 2.Assume a reasonable velocity-proﬁle shape inside the boundary layer. 3.Derive an expression for τ wusing the results obtained from item 2. To illustrate the application of Eq. 9.17 to boundary-layer ﬂows, we consider ﬁrst the case of ﬂow with zero pressure gradient over a ﬂat plate (Section 9.5)—the results weobtain for a laminar boundary layer can then be compared to the exact Blasius results.The effects of pressure gradients in boundary-layer ﬂow are then discussed in Section 9.6. 9.5 Use of the Momentum Integral Equation for Flow with Zero Pressure Gradient For the special case of a ﬂat plate (zero pressure gradient) the freestream pressure p and velocity Uare both constant, so for item 1we have U(x)5U5constant. The momentum integral equation then reduces to τw5ρU2dθ dx5ρU2d dxZδ 0u U12u U/C16/C17 dy ð9:18Þ The velocity distribution, u/U, in the boundary layer is assumed to be similar for all values of xand normally is speciﬁed as a function of y/δ. (Note that u/Uis dimen- sionless and δis a function of xonly.) Consequently, it is convenient to change the variable of integration from ytoy/δ. Deﬁning η5y δ we get dy5δdη and the momentum integral equation for zero pressure gradient is written τw5ρU2dθ dx5ρU2dδ dxZ1 0u U12u U/C16/C17 dη ð9:19Þ We wish to solve this equation for the boundary-layer thickness as a function of x. To do this, we must satisfy the remaining items: 2.Assume a velocity distribution in the boundary layer—a functional relationship ofthe form u U5fy δ/C16/C179.5 Use of the Momentum Integral Equation for Flow with Zero Pressure Gradient 433a.The assumed velocity distribution should satisfy the following approximate physical boundary conditions: aty50; u50 aty5δ; u5U aty5δ;@u @y50 b.Note that once we have assumed a velocity distribution, from the deﬁnition of the momentum thickness (Eq. 9.2), the numerical value of the integral in Eq. 9.19 is simply Z1 0u U12u U/C16/C17 dη5θ δ5constant 5β and the momentum integral equation becomes τw5ρU2dδ dxβ 3.Obtain an expression for τwin terms of δ.

It has the same form as the exact solution derived from the complete dif- ferential equations of motion by H. Blasius in 1908. Remarkably, Eq. 9.21 is only inerror (the constant is too large) by about 10 percent compared with the exactsolution (Section 9.3 on the Web). Table 9.2 summarizes corresponding results calculated using other approximate velocity proﬁles and lists results obtained fromthe exact solution. (The only thing that changes in the analysis when we choose adifferent velocity proﬁle is the value of βinτ w5ρU2dδ=dxβin item 2bon page 434.) The shapes of the approximate proﬁl es may be compared readily by plotting u/U versus y/δ. Once we know the boundary-layer thickness, all details of the ﬂow may be determined.

These calculations conﬁrm that viscous effects are conﬁned to a very thin layer near the surface of a body.

Data for turbulentboundary layers plot on the universal velocity proﬁle using coordinates of u=u*versus yu*/ν, as shown in Fig. 8.9. However, this proﬁle is rather complex mathematically for easy use with the momentum integral equation. The momentum integral equation isapproximate; hence, an acceptable velocity proﬁle for turbulent boundary layers onsmooth ﬂat plates is the empirical power-law proﬁle. An exponent of 1 7is typically used to model the turbulent velocity proﬁle. Thus u U5y δ/C16/C171=7 5η1=7ð9:24Þ However, this proﬁle does not hold in the immediate vicinity of the wall, since at the wall it predicts du/dy5N.

Wall shear stress is much higher in the turbulent boundary layer than in the laminar layer. This is the primary reason for the more rapid development of turbulent boundary layers. The agreement we have obtained with experimental results shows that use of the momentum integral equation is an effective approximate method that gives us con-siderable insight into the general behavior of boundary layers. 9.6 Pressure Gradients in Boundary-Layer Flow The boundary layer (laminar or turbulent) with a uniform ﬂow along an inﬁnite ﬂatplate is the easiest one to study because the pressure gradient is zero—the ﬂuidparticles in the boundary layer are slowed only by shear stresses, leading to boundary-layer growth. We now consider the effects caused by a pressure gradient, which will bepresent for all bodies except, as we have seen, a ﬂat plate. Afavorable pressure gradient is one in which the pressure decreases in the ﬂow direction (i.e., @p/@x,0); it is called favorable because it tends to overcome the slowing of ﬂuid particles caused by friction in the boundary layer. This pressuregradient arises when the freestream velocity Uis increasing with x, for example, in the converging ﬂow ﬁeld in a nozzle. On the other hand, an adverse pressure gradient is one in which pressure increases in the ﬂow direction (i.e., @p/@x.0); it is called adverse because it will cause ﬂuid particles in the boundary-layer to slow down at agreater rate than that due to boundary-layer friction alone. If the adverse pressuregradient is severe enough, the ﬂuid particles in the boundary layer will actually bebrought to rest. When this occurs, the particles will be forced away from the body surface (a phenomenon called ﬂow separation ) as they make room for following particles, ultimately leading to a wake in which ﬂow is turbulent. Examples of this are when the walls of a diffuser diverge too rapidly and when an airfoil has too large an angle of attack; both of these are generally very undesirable! This description, of the adverse pressure gradient and friction in the boundary layer together forcing ﬂow separation, certainly makes intuitive sense; the question ariseswhether we can more formally see when this occurs. For example, can we have ﬂowseparation and a wake for uniform ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, for which @p/@x50? We can gain insight into this question by considering when the velocity in the boundary layerwill become zero. Consider the velocity uin the boundary layer at an inﬁnitesimal distance Δyabove the plate. This will be u y5Δy5u01@u @y/C19 y50Δy5@u @y/C19 y50Δy where u050 is the velocity at the surface of the plate. It is clear that uy5Δywill be zero (i.e., separation will occur) only when @u/@y)y5050. Hence, we can use this as our litmus test for ﬂow separation. We recall that the velocity gradient near thesurface in a laminar boundary layer, and in the viscous sublayer of a turbulentboundary layer, was related to the wall shear stress by τ w5μ@u @y/C19 y50 Further, we learned in the previous section that the wall shear stress for the ﬂat plateis given by τwðxÞ ρU25constantﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃRexp VIDEO Flow Separation: Sudden Expansion. VIDEO Flow Separation: Airfoil. 442 Chapter 9External Incompressible Viscous Flowfor a laminar boundary layer and τwðxÞ ρU25constant Re1=5 x for a turbulent boundary layer. We see that for the ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, the wall stress is always τw.0. Hence, @u/@y)y50.0 always; and therefore, ﬁnally, uy5Δy.0 always. We conclude that for uniform ﬂow over a ﬂat plate the ﬂow never separates, and we never develop a wake region, whether the boundary layer is laminar or tur-bulent, regardless of plate length. We conclude that ﬂow will not separate for ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, when @p/@x50. Clearly, for ﬂows in which @p/@x,0 (whenever the freestream velocity is increasing), we can be sure that there will be no ﬂow separation; for ﬂows in which @p/@x.0 (i.e., adverse pressure gradients) we could have ﬂow separation. We should not conclude that an adverse pressure gradient always leads to ﬂow separation and a wake; we have only concluded that it is a necessary condition for ﬂow separation to occur. To illustrate these results consider the variable cross-sectional ﬂow shown in Fig. 9.6 . Outside the boundary layer the velocity ﬁeld is one in which the ﬂow accelerates (Region 1), has a constant velocity region (Region 2), and then a deceleration region (Region 3). Corresponding to these, the pressure gradient is favorable, zero, and adverse, respectively, as shown. (Note that the straight wall is not a simple ﬂat plate—it has these various pressure gradients because the ﬂow above the wall is not a uniformﬂow.) From our discussions above, we conclude that separation cannot occur in Region1 or 2, but can (as shown) occur in Region 3. Could we avoid ﬂow separation in a device like this? Intuitively, we can see that if we make the divergent section less severe, we may be able to eliminate ﬂow separation. In other words, we may eliminate ﬂow separation if we make the adverse pressure gradient @p/@xsmall enough. The ﬁnal question remaining is how small the adverse pressure gradient needs to be to accom-plish this. This, and a more rigorous proof that we must have @p/@x.0f o rac h a n c eo f ﬂow separation, is beyond the scope of this text [3]. We conclude that ﬂow separation ispossible, but not guaranteed, when we have an adverse pressure gradient. The nondimensional velocity proﬁles for laminar and turbulent boundary-layer ﬂow over a ﬂat plate are shown in Fig. 9.7 a. The turbulent proﬁle is much fuller (more blunt) than the laminar proﬁle. At the same freestream speed, the momentum ﬂuxwithin the turbulent boundary layer is greater than within the laminar layer (Fig. 9.7 b). Separation occurs when the momentum of ﬂuid layers near the surface is reduced to zeroby the combined action of pressure and viscous forces. As shown in Fig. 9.7b ,t h e momentum of the ﬂuid near the surface is signiﬁcantly greater for the turbulent proﬁle.

We shall discuss some consequences of this behavior in Section 9.7. Adverse pressure gradients cause signiﬁcant changes in velocity proﬁles for both laminar and turbulent boundary-layer ﬂows. Approximate solutions for nonzeropressure gradient ﬂow may be obtained from the momentum integral equation τw ρ5d dxðU2θÞ1δ*UdU dxð9:17Þ Expanding the ﬁrst term, we can write τw ρ5U2dθ dx1ðδ*12θÞUdU dx or τw ρU25Cf 25dθ dx1ðH12Þθ UdU dxð9:28Þ where H5δ*/θis a velocity-proﬁle “shape factor.” The shape factor increases in an adverse pressure gradient. For turbulent boundary-layer ﬂow, Hincreases from 1.3 for a zero pressure gradient to approximately 2.5 at separation. For laminar ﬂow withzero pressure gradient, H52.6; at separation H53.5. The freestream velocity distribution, U(x), must be known before Eq. 9.28 can be applied. Since dp/dx52ρUd U /dx, specifying U(x) is equivalent to specifying the pressure gradient. We can obtain a ﬁrst approximation for U(x) from ideal ﬂow theory for an inviscid ﬂow under the same conditions. As pointed out in Chapter 6, forfrictionless irrotational ﬂow (potential ﬂow), the stream function, ψ, and the velocity potential, φ, satisfy Laplace’s equation. These can be used to determine U(x) over the body surface. Much effort has been devoted to calculation of velocity distributions over bodies of known shape (the “direct” problem) and to the determination of body shapesto produce a desired pressure distribution (the “inverse” problem). Smith andco-workers [6] have developed calculation methods that use singularities distributedover the body surface to solve the direct problem for two-dimensional or axisym-metric body shapes. A type of ﬁnite-element method that uses singularities deﬁned on discrete surface panels (the “panel” method [7]) recently has gained increased popularity for application to three-dimensional ﬂows.

A detailed discussion of various calculation methods for ﬂows with nonzero pressure gradient is beyond the scope of this book. Numerous solutions for laminar ﬂows are given in Kraus [8]. Calculation methods for turbulent boundary-layer ﬂow based on the momentum integral equationare reviewed in Rotta [9]. Because of the importance of turbulent boundary layers in engineering ﬂow situations, the state of the art of calculation schemes is advancing rapidly. Numerouscalculation schemes have been proposed [10, 11]; most such schemes for turbulentﬂow use models to predict turbulent shear stress and then solve the boundary-layerequations numerically [12, 13]. Continuing improvement in size and speed of com- puters is beginning to make possible the solution of the full Navier /C0Stokes equations using numerical methods [14, 15]. Part B Fluid Flow About Immersed Bodies Whenever there is relative motion between a solid body and the viscous ﬂuid sur- rounding it, the body will experience a net force ~F. The magnitude of this force depends on many factors—certainly the relative velocity ~V, but also the body shape and size, and the ﬂuid properties ( ρ,μ, etc.). As the ﬂuid ﬂows around the body, it will generate surface stresses on each element of the surface, and it is these that lead to thenet force. The surface stresses are composed of tangential stresses due to viscous action and normal stresses due to the local pressure. We might be tempted to think that we can analytically derive the net force by integrating these over the body sur-face. The ﬁrst step might be: Given the shape of the body (and assuming that theReynolds number is high enough that we can use inviscid ﬂow theory), computethe pressure distribution. Then integrate the pressure over the body surface toobtain the contribution of pressure forces to the net force ~F. (As we discussed in Chapter 6, this step was developed very early in the history of ﬂuid mechanics; it led tothe result that no bodies experience drag!) The second step might be: Use this pressure distribution to ﬁnd the surface viscous stress τ w(at least in principle, using, for example, Eq. 9.17). Then integrate the viscous stress over the body surface to obtain its contribution to the net force ~F. This procedure sounds conceptually straightforward, but in practice is quite difﬁcult except for the simplest body shapes.In addition, even if possible, it leads to erroneous results in most cases because it takesno account of a very important consequence of the existence of boundary layers—ﬂowseparation. This causes a wake, which not only creates a low-pressure region usuallyleading to large drag on the body, but also radically changes the overall ﬂow ﬁeld and hence the inviscid ﬂow region and pressure distribution on the body. For these reasons we must usually resort to experimental methods to determine the net force for most body shapes (although CFD approaches are improving rapidly). Traditionally the net force ~Fis resolved into the drag force, F D, deﬁned as the component of the force parallel to the direction of motion, and the lift force, FL(if it exists for a body), deﬁned as the component of the force perpendicular to thedirection of motion. In Sections 9.7 and 9.8 we will examine these forces for a numberof different body shapes. 9.7 Drag Drag is the component of force on a body acting parallel to the direction of relativemotion. In discussing the need for experimental results in ﬂuid mechanics (Chapter 7),we considered the problem of determining the drag force, F D, on a smooth sphere of VIDEO Flow about a Sports Car. 9.7Drag 445diameter d, moving through a viscous, incompressible ﬂuid with speed V; the ﬂuid density and viscosity were ρandμ, respectively.

Had these been included, we would have obtained the functional form CD5fðRe;Fr;MÞ At this point we shall consider the drag force on several bodies for which Eq. 9.31 is valid. The total drag force is the sum of friction drag and pressure drag. However, the drag coefﬁcient is a function only of the Reynolds number. We now consider the drag force and drag coefﬁcient for a number of bodies, starting with the simplest: a ﬂat plate parallel to the ﬂow (which has only friction drag); a ﬂat plate normal to the ﬂow (which has only pressure drag); and cylinders andspheres (the simplest 2D and 3D bodies, which have both friction and pressure drag).We will also brieﬂy discuss streamlining. Pure Friction Drag: Flow over a Flat Plate Parallel to the Flow This ﬂow situation was considered in detail in Section 9.5. Since the pressure gradientis zero (and in any event the pressure forces are perpendicular to the plateand therefore do not contribute to drag), the total drag is equal to the frictiondrag.

The actual Reynolds number at which transition occurs depends on a combination of factors, such as surface roughness andfreestream disturbances.

The drag is given by FD5Z surfacepdA For this geometry the ﬂow separates from the edges of the plate; there is back-ﬂow in the low energy wake of the plate. Although the pressure over the rear surface of theplate is essentially constant, its magnitude cannot be determined analytically. Con-sequently, we must resort to experiments to determine the drag force. The drag coefﬁcient for ﬂow over an immersed object usually is based on the frontal area (or projected area) of the object. (For airfoils and wings, the planform area is used; see Section 9.8.) The drag coefﬁcient for a ﬁnite plate normal to the ﬂow depends on the ratio of plate width to height and on the Reynolds number. For Re(based on height) greater than about 1000, the drag coefﬁcient is essentially independent of Reynolds number.The variation of C Dwith the ratio of plate width to height ( b/h) is shown in Fig. 9.10 . (The ratio b/his deﬁned as the aspect ratio of the plate.) For b/h51.0, the drag coefﬁcient is a minimum at CD51.18; this is just slightly higher than for a circular disk ( CD51.17) at large Reynolds number. The drag coefﬁcient for all objects with sharp edges is essentially independent of Reynolds number (for Re*1000) because the separation points and therefore the size of the wake are ﬁxed by the geometry of the object. Drag coefﬁcients for selectedobjects are given in Table 9.3 . Friction and Pressure Drag: Flow over a Sphere and Cylinder We have looked at two special ﬂow cases in which either friction or pressure drag was the sole form of drag present. In the former case, the drag coefﬁcient was a strong function of Reynolds number, while in the latter case, CDwas essentially independent of Reynolds number for Re*1000. In the case of ﬂow over a sphere, both friction drag and pressure drag contribute to total drag. The drag coefﬁcient for ﬂow over a smooth sphere is shown in Fig. 9.11 as a function of Reynolds number.2 At very low Reynolds number,3Re#1, there is no ﬂow separation from a sphere; the wake is laminar and the drag is predominantly friction drag. Stokes has shown analytically, for very low Reynolds number ﬂows where inertia forces may be Wake Fig. 9.9 Flow over a ﬂat plate normal to the ﬂow.

CLASSIC VIDEO Low Reynolds Number Flows.9.7Drag 451As the Reynolds number is further increased, the drag coefﬁcient drops con- tinuously up to a Reynolds number of about 1000, but not as rapidly as predicted by Stokes’ theory. A turbulent wake (not incorporated in Stokes’ theory) develops andgrows at the rear of the sphere as the separation point moves from the rear of thesphere toward the front; this wake is at a relatively low pressure, leading to a largepressure drag. By the time Re/C251000, about 95% of total drag is due to pressure. For 10 3,Re,33105the drag coefﬁcient is approximately constant. In this range the entire rear of the sphere has a low-pressure turbulent wake, as indicated in Fig. 9.12 , and most of the drag is caused by the front-rear pressure asymmetry. Note that CD~ 1/Recorresponds to FD~V, and that CDBconst. corresponds to FD~V2, indicating a quite rapid increase in drag. For Reynolds numbers larger than about 3 3105, transition occurs and the boundary layer on the forward portion of the sphere becomes turbulent. The point ofseparation then moves downstream from the sphere midsection, and the size of thewake decreases. The net pressure force on the sphere is reduced (Fig. 9.12 ), and the drag coefﬁcient decreases abruptly. A turbulent boundary layer, since it has more momentum ﬂux than a laminar boundary layer, can better resist an adverse pressure gradient, as discussed in Section9.6. Consequently, turbulent boundary-layer ﬂow is desirable on a blunt body becauseit delays separation and thus reduces the pressure drag. Transition in the boundary layer is affected by roughness of the sphere surface and turbulence in the ﬂow stream. Therefore, the reduction in drag associated with aturbulent boundary layer does not occur at a unique value of Reynolds number.Experiments with smooth spheres in a ﬂow with low turbulence level show that transition may be delayed to a critical Reynolds number, Re D, of about 4 3105. For rough surfaces and/or highly turbulent freestream ﬂow, transition can occur at a cri- tical Reynolds number as low as 50,000. The drag coefﬁcient of a sphere with turbulent boundary-layer ﬂow is about one- ﬁfth that for laminar ﬂow near the critical Reynolds number. The correspondingreduction in drag force can affect the range of a sphere (e.g., a golf ball) appreciably.The “dimples” on a golf ball are designed to “trip” the boundary layer and, thus, toguarantee turbulent boundary-layer ﬂow and minimum drag. To illustrate this effect graphically, we obtained samples of golf balls without dimples some years ago. One of our students volunteered to hit drives with the smooth balls. In 50 tries with each typeof ball, the average distance with the standard balls was 215 yards; the average withthe smooth balls was only 125 yards!Theory due to Stokes400 200 100 60 40 20 10 6 4 2 1 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.1 0.06 10–124 6 8 10024 6 8 10124 6 8 10224 6 8 10324 6 8 10424 6 8 10510624 6 8 Re =CD VD__v Fig. 9.11 Drag coefﬁcient of a smooth sphere as a function of Reynolds number [3]. VIDEO Examples of Flow around a Sphere. 452 Chapter 9External Incompressible Viscous FlowAdding roughness elements to a sphere also can suppress local oscillations in location of the transition between laminar and turbulent ﬂow in the boundary layer. These oscillations can lead to variations in drag and to random ﬂuctuations in lift (seeSection 9.8). In baseball, the “knuckle ball” pitch is intended to behave erratically toconfuse the batter. By throwing the ball with almost no spin, the pitcher relies on theseams to cause transition in an unpredictable fashion as the ball moves on its way tothe batter. This causes the desired variation in the ﬂight path of the ball. Figure 9.13 shows the drag coefﬁcient for ﬂow over a smooth cylinder. The var- iation of C Dwith Reynolds number shows the same characteristics as observed in the ﬂow over a smooth sphere, but the values of CDare about twice as high. Flow about a smooth circular cylinder may develop a regular pattern of alternating vortices downstream. The v ortex trail4causes an oscillatory lift force on the cylinder perpendicular to the stream motion. Vortex shedding excites oscillations that cause telegraph wires to “sing” and ropes on ﬂag poles to “slap” annoyingly. Sometimesstructural oscillations can reach dangerous magnitudes and cause high stresses; they can be reduced or eliminated by applying roughness elements or ﬁns—either axial or helical (sometimes seen on chimneys or automobile antennas)—that destroy thesymmetry of the cylinder and stabilize the ﬂow. Experimental data show that regular vortex shedding occurs most strongly in the range of Reynolds number from about 60 to 5000.

The objective of wind tunnel tests is to simulate the conditions of an unbounded ﬂow. Limitations on equipment size make this goalunreachable in practice. Frequently it is necessary to apply corrections to measureddata to obtain results applicable to unbounded ﬂow conditions. In numerous realistic ﬂow situations, interactions occur with nearby objects or surfaces. Drag can be reduced signiﬁcantly when two or more objects, moving in tandem, interact. This phenomenon is well known to bicycle riders and those inter- ested in automobile racing, where “drafting” is a common practice. Drag reductions of80 percent may be achieved with optimum spacing [20]. Drag also can be increasedsigniﬁcantly when spacing is not optimum. Drag can be affected by neighbors alongside as well. Small particles falling under gravity travel more slowly when they have neighbors than when they are isolated. Thisphenomenon has important applications to mixing and sedimentation processes. Experimental data for drag coefﬁcients on objects must be selected and applied carefully. Due regard must be given to the differences between the actual conditionsand the more controlled conditions under which measurements were made. Streamlining The extent of the separated ﬂow region behind many of the objects discussed in theprevious section can be reduced or eliminated by streamlining, or fairing, the body shape. We have seen that due to the convergent body shape at the rear of any object (after all, every object is of ﬁnite length!), the streamlines will diverge, so that thevelocity will decrease, and therefore, more importantly (as shown by the Bernoulliequation, applicable in the freestream region) the pressure will increase.

CLASSIC VIDEO Low Reynolds Number Flows.456 Chapter 9External Incompressible Viscous Flowinitially have an adverse pressure gradient at the rear of the body, leading to boundary-layer separation and ultimately to a low-pressure wake leading to largepressure drag. Streamlining is the attempt to reduce the drag on a body. We canreduce the drag on a body by making the rear of the body more tapered (e.g., wecan reduce the drag on a sphere by making it “teardrop” shaped), which will reduce the adverse pressure gradient and hence make the turbulent wake smaller. However, as we do so, we are in danger of increasing the skin friction drag simply because wehave increased the surface area. In practice, there is an optimum amount of fairing ortapering at which the total drag (the sum of pressure and skin friction drag) isminimized. The pressure gradient around a “teardrop” shape (a “streamlined” cylinder) is less severe than that around a cylinder of circular section. The trade-off between pressureand friction drag for this case is illustrated by the results presented in Fig. 9.14 , for tests at Re c543105. (This Reynolds number is typical of that for a strut on an early aircraft.) From the ﬁgure, the minimum drag coefﬁcient is CD/C250:06, which occurs when the ratio of thickness to chord is t=c/C250:25. This value is approximately 20 percent of the minimum drag coefﬁcient for a circular cylinder of the same thickness!Hence, even a small aircraft will typically have fairings on many structural members,e.g., the struts that make up the landing wheel assembly, leading to signiﬁcant fuelsavings. The maximum thickness for the shapes shown in Fig. 9.14 is located approximately 25 percent of the chord distance from the leading edge. Most of the drag on thethinner sections is due to skin friction in the turbulent boundary layers on the taperedrear sections. Interest in low-drag airfoils increased during the 1930s. The NationalAdvisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) developed several series of “laminar-ﬂow” airfoils for which transition was postponed to 60 or 65 percent chord length aftfrom the airfoil nose. Pressure distribution and drag coefﬁcients 5for two symmetric airfoils of inﬁnite span and 15 percent thickness at zero angle of attack are presented in Fig. 9.15. Transition on the conventional (NACA 0015) airfoil takes place where the pressure gradient becomes adverse, at x=c50:13, near the point of maximum thickness. Thus most of the airfoil surface is covered with a turbulent boundary layer; the dragcoefﬁcient is C D/C250:0061.

The boundary layer is maintained in the laminar regime by the favorable pressure gradient to x=c50:63. Thus the bulk of the ﬂow is laminar; CD/C250:0035 for this section, based on planform area. The drag coefﬁcient based on frontal area is CDf5CD=0:1550:0233, or about 40 percent of the optimum for the shapes shown in Fig. 9.14. Tests in special wind tunnels have shown that laminar ﬂow can be maintained up to length Reynolds numbers as high as 30 million by appropriate proﬁle shaping. Because they have favorable drag characteristics, laminar-ﬂow airfoils are used in thedesign of most modern subsonic aircraft. Recent advances have made possible development of low-drag shapes even better than the NACA 60-series shapes. Experiments [21, 22] led to the development of apressure distribution that prevented separation while maintaining the turbulentboundary layer in a condition that produces negligible skin friction. Improvedmethods for calculating body shapes that produced a desired pressure distribution[23, 24] led to development of nearly optimum shapes for thick struts with low drag.Figure 9.16 shows an example of the results. Reduction of aerodynamic drag also is important for road vehicle applications. Interest in fuel economy has provided signiﬁcant incentive to balance efﬁcient aero- dynamic performance with attractive design for automobiles. Drag reduction also has become important for buses and trucks. Practical considerations limit the overall length of road vehicles. Fully streamlined tails are impractical for all but land-speed-record cars. Consequently, it is not possibleto achieve results comparable to those for optimum airfoil shapes. However, it ispossible to optimize both front and rear contours within given constraints on overalllength [25 /C027].NACA 662–015 Laminar-flow section, CD ≈ 0.0035Conventional section, CD ≅0.0061tmax x ctmax_____ c= 0.15V p∞1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 –0.2 –0.4 –0.6 –0.8 –1.0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Dimensionless distance, x /c0.8 1.0Re = = 6 /H11003 106Pressure coefficient, Cp =p – p ∞_______ V2 1_ 2ρ NACA 0015 Vc__v Fig. 9.15 Theoretical pressure distributions at zero angle of attack for two symmetric airfoil sections of 15 percent thickness ratio.

Studies on buses have shown that drag reductions up to 25 percent are possible with careful attention to front contour [27]. Thus it is possible to reduce the drag coefﬁcient of a bus from about 0.65to less than 0.5 with practical designs. Highway tractor-trailer rigs have higher dragcoefﬁcients— C Dvalues from 0.90 to 1.1 have been reported. Commercially available add-on devices offer improvements in drag of up to 15 percent, particularly for windyconditions where yaw angles are nonzero. The typical fuel saving is half the percen- tage by which aerodynamic drag is reduced. Front contours and details are important for automobiles. A low nose and smoothly rounded contours are the primary features that promote low drag. Radii of “A-pillar” and windshield header, and blending of accessories to reduce parasite and inter-ference drag have received increased attention. As a result, drag coefﬁcients havebeen reduced from about 0.55 to 0.30 or less for recent production vehicles. Recentadvances in computational methods have led to development of computer-generatedoptimum shapes. A number of designs have been proposed, with claims of C Dvalues below 0.2 for vehicles complete with running gear. 9.8 Lift For most objects in relative motion in a ﬂuid, the most signiﬁcant ﬂuid force is thedrag. However, there are some objects, such as airfoils, for which the lift is signiﬁcant.Lift is deﬁned as the component of ﬂuid force perpendicular to the ﬂuid motion. Foran airfoil, the lift coefﬁcient ,C L, is deﬁned as CL/C17FL 1 2ρV2Apð9:38Þ It is worth noting that the lift coefﬁcient deﬁned above and the drag coefﬁcient (Eq. 9.30) are each deﬁned as the ratio of an actual force (lift or drag) divided by theproduct of dynamic pressure and area. This denominator can be viewed as the forcethat would be generated if we imagined bringing to rest the ﬂuid directly approachingthe area (recall that the dynamic pressure is the difference between total and staticpressures). This gives us a “feel” for the meaning of the coefﬁcients: They indicate theratio of the actual force to this (unrealistic but nevertheless intuitively meaningful)force. We note also that the coefﬁcient deﬁnitions include V 2in the denominator, so that FL(orFD) being proportional to V2corresponds to a constant CL(orCD), and that FL(orFD) increasing with Vat a lower rate than quadratic corresponds to a decrease in CL(orCD) with V. The lift and drag coefﬁcients for an airfoil are functions of both Reynolds number and angle of attack; the angle of attack, α, is the angle between the airfoil chord and the freestream velocity vector. The chord of an airfoil is the straight line joining the leading edge and the trailing edge. The wing section shape is obtained by combiningamean line and a thickness distribution (see [21] for details). When the airfoil has aFig. 9.16 Nearly optimum shape for low-drag strut [24].9.8 Lift 459symmetric section, the mean line and the chord line both are straight lines, and they coincide. An airfoil with a curved mean line is said to be cambered . The area at right angles to the ﬂow changes with angle of attack. Consequently, the planform area, Ap(the maximum projected area of the wing), is used to deﬁne lift and drag coefﬁcients for an airfoil. The phenomenon of aerodynamic lift is commonly explained by the velocity increase causing pressure to decrease (the Bernoulli effect) over the top surface of theairfoil and the velocity decrease (causing pressure to increase) along the bottomsurface of the airfoil. The resulting pressure distributions are shown clearly in thevideo Boundary Layer Control . Because of the pressure differences relative to atmosphere, the upper surface of the airfoil may be called the suction surface and the lower surface the pressure surface . As shown in Example 6.12, lift on a body can also be related to the circu- lation around the proﬁle: In order for lift to be generated, there must be a netcirculation around the proﬁle. One may imagine the circulation to be caused by avortex “bound” within the proﬁle. Advances continue in computational methods and computer hardware. However, most airfoil data available in the literature were obtained from wind tunnel tests.Reference [21] contains results from a large number of tests conducted by NACA (the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics—the predecessor to NASA). Data for some representative NACA proﬁle shapes are described in the next few paragraphs. Lift and drag coefﬁcient data for typical conventional and laminar-ﬂow proﬁles are plotted in Fig. 9.17 for a Reynolds number of 9 310 6based on chord length.

As the angle of attack is increased, the Δpbetween the upper and lower surfaces increases, causing the lift coefﬁcient to increase smoothly until a maximum is reached. Further increases in angle of attack produce a sudden decrease in CL. The airfoil is said to have stalled when CLdrops in this fashion. Airfoil stall results when ﬂow separation occurs over a major portion of the upper surface of the airfoil. As the angle of attack is increased, the stagnation point moves CLASSIC VIDEO Boundary Layer Control. VIDEO Flow Past an Airfoil (α50/C14). VIDEO Flow Past an Airfoil (α510/C14).

Flow on the upper surface then must accelerate sharply to round the nose of the airfoil. The effect of angle of attack on the theoretical upper-surface pressure distribution is shown in Fig. 9.18 b. The minimum pressure becomes lower, and its location moves forward on the upper surface. A severe adverse pressure gradient appears following the point of minimum pressure; ﬁnally, theadverse pressure gradient causes the ﬂow to separate completely from the uppersurface and the airfoil stalls (the uniform pressure in the turbulent wake will beapproximately equal to the pressure just before separation, i.e., low). Movement of the minimum pressure point and accentuation of the adverse pres- sure gradient are responsible for the sudden increase in C Dfor the laminar-ﬂow section, which is apparent in Fig. 9.17 . The sudden rise in CDis caused by early transition from laminar to turbulent boundary-layer ﬂow on the upper surface.

The maximum possible lift coefﬁcient, CLmax, also is less for laminar-ﬂow sections. Plots of CLversus CD(called lift-drag polars) often are used to present airfoil data in compact form. A polar plot is given in Fig. 9.19 for the two sections we have dis- cussed. The lift/drag ratio, CL/CD, is shown at the design lift coefﬁcient for both sections. This ratio is very important in the design of aircraft: The lift coefﬁcientdetermines the lift of the wing and hence the load that can be carried, and the dragcoefﬁcient indicates a large part (in addition to that caused by the fuselage, etc.) of thedrag the airplane engines have to work against in order to generate the needed lift;hence, in general, a high C L/CDis the goal, at which the laminar airfoil clearly excels.α= 0 α> 0 (a) Flow patternsVV Stagnation point V α NACA 662–0151.0 0.8 0.60.4 0.2 –0.2 –0.4 –0.6 –0.8 –1.0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Dimensionless distance, x /c (b) Pressure distribution on upper surface0.8 1.00 α= 1.5 ° (CL = 0.3)α= 1.0 ° (CL = 0.2)α= 0.5 ° (CL = 0.1)α= 0° (CL = 0)Pressure coefficient, Cp =p – p ∞ ________ V2 ρ1_ 2 Fig. 9.18 Effect of angle of attack on ﬂow pattern and theoretical pressure distribution for a symmetric laminar-ﬂow airfoil of 15 percent thickness ratio. (Data from [21].)462 Chapter 9External Incompressible Viscous FlowRecent improvements in modeling and computational capabilities have made it possible to design airfoil sections that develop high lift while maintaining very low drag [23, 24]. Boundary-layer calculation codes are used with inverse methods forcalculating potential ﬂow to develop pressure distributions and the resulting body shapes that postpone transition to the most rearward location possible. The turbulent boundary layer following transition is maintained in a state of incipient separationwith nearly zero skin friction by appropriate shaping of the pressure distribution. Such computer-designed airfoils have been used on racing cars to develop very high negative lift (downforce) to improve high-speed stability and cornering performance [23].Airfoil sections especially designed for operation at low Reynolds number were used forthe wings and propeller on the Kremer prize-winning man-powered “Gossamer Condor”[28], which now hangs in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. All real airfoils— wings —are of ﬁnite span and have less lift and more drag than their airfoil section data would indicate. There are several ways to explain this.

These trailing vortices can also be explained more abstractly, in terms of circulation: We learned in Section 6.6 that circulation around a wing section is present whenever we have lift, and that the circulation is solenoidal— that is, it cannot end in the ﬂuid; hence, the circulation extends beyond the wing in theform of trailing vortices. Trailing vortices can be very strong and persistent, possiblybeing a hazard to other aircraft for 5 to 10 miles behind a large airplane—air speeds ofgreater than 200 mph have been measured. 6 Trailing vortices reduce lift because of the loss of pressure difference, as we just mentioned. This reduction and an increase in drag (called induced drag ) can also be explained in the following way: The “downwash” velocities induced by the vortices mean that the effective angle of attack is reduced—the wing “sees” a ﬂow at approximately the mean of the upstream and downstream directions—explaining whythe wing has less lift than its section data would suggest. This also causes the lift force(which is perpendicular to the effective angle of attack) to “lean backwards” a little,resulting in some of the lift appearing as drag. Loss of lift and increase in drag caused by ﬁnite-span effects are concentrated near the tip of the wing; hence, it is clear that a short, stubby wing will experience theseeffects more severely than a very long wing. We should therefore expect the effects to correlate with the wing aspect ratio , deﬁned as AR/C17b2 Apð9:39Þ where Apis planform area and bis wingspan. For a rectangular planform of wingspan band chord length c, AR5b2 Ap5b2 bc5b c The maximum lift/drag ratio ( L=D5CL=CD) for a modern low-drag section may be as high as 400 for inﬁnite aspect ratio. A high-performance sailplane (glider) with AR540 might have L=D540, and a typical light plane ( AR/C2512) might have L=D/C2520 or so. Two examples of rather poor shapes are lifting bodies used for reentry from the upper atmosphere, and water skis, which are hydrofoils of low aspect ratio. For both of these shapes, L/Dtypically is less than unity. Variations in aspect ratio are seen in nature. Soaring birds, such as the albatross or California condor, have thin wings of long span. Birds that must maneuver quickly tocatch their prey, such as owls, have wings of relatively short span, but large area, which gives low wing loading (ratio of weight to planform area) and thus high maneuverability. It makes sense that as we try to generate more lift from a ﬁnite wing (by, for example, increasing the angle of attack), the trailing vortices and therefore the downwash increase; we also learned that the downwash causes the effective angle ofattack to be less than that of the corresponding airfoil section (i.e., when AR5N), ultimately leading to loss of lift and to induced drag. Hence, we conclude that theeffects of the ﬁnite aspect ratio can be characterized as a reduction Δαin the effective angle of attack, and that this (which is usually undesirable) becomes worse as we generate more lift (i.e., as the lift coefﬁcient C Lincreases) and as the aspect ratio ARis made smaller.

It is possible to increase the effective aspect ratio for a wing of given geometric ratio by adding an endplate orwinglet to the wing tip. An endplate may be a simple plate attached at the tip, perpendicular to the wing span, as on the rear-mounted wing of a racing car (see Fig. 9.26 ). An endplate functions by blocking the ﬂow that tends to migrate from the high-pressure region below the wing tip to the low-pressure regionabove the tip when the wing is producing lift. When the endplate is added, thestrength of the trailing vortex and the induced drag are reduced. Winglets are short, aerodynamically contoured wings set perpendicular to the wing at the tip. Like the endplate, the winglet reduces the strength of the trailing vortexsystem and the induced drag. The winglet also produces a small component of force in the ﬂight direction, which has the effect of further reducing the overall drag of the aircraft. The contour and angle of attack of the winglet are adjusted based on windtunnel tests to provide optimum results. As we have seen, aircraft can be ﬁtted wit h low-drag airfoils to give excellent performance at cruise conditions. However , since the maximum lift coefﬁcient is low for thin airfoils, additional effort must be expended to obtain acceptably low landing speeds. In steady-state ﬂight conditions, lift must equal aircraft weight.Thus, W5F L5CL1 2ρV2A Minimum ﬂight speed is therefore obtained when CL5CLmax.

Two basic techniques are available to control these variables: variable-geometry wing sections (e.g., obtained through the use of ﬂaps) orboundary-layer control techniques. Flaps are movable portions of a wing trailing edge that may be extended during landing and takeoff to increase effective wing area. The effects on lift and drag of twotypical ﬂap conﬁgurations are shown in Fig. 9.23 , as applied to the NACA 23012 airfoil section. The maximum lift coefﬁcient for this section is increased from 1.52 in the “clean” condition to 3.48 with double-slotted ﬂaps. From Eq. 9.44, the corre- sponding reduction in landing speed would be 34 percent. Figure 9.23 shows that section drag is increased s ubstantially by high-lift devices. From Fig. 9.23b , section drag at C LmaxðCD/C250:28Þwith double-slotted ﬂaps is about 5 times as high as section drag at CLmaxðCD/C250:055Þfor the clean airfoil. Induced drag due to lift must be added to section dr ag to obtain total drag. Because induced drag is proportional to CL2(Eq. 9.41), total drag rises sharply at low aircraft speeds. At speeds near stall, drag may increase enough to exceed the thrust available from the engines. To avoid this dangerous region of unstable operation, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) limits operation of commercial aircraft to speeds above 1.2 times stall speed. Although details are beyond the scope of this book, the basic purpose of all boundary-layer control techniques is to delay separation or reduce drag, by adding CLASSIC VIDEO Boundary Layer Control.466 Chapter 9External Incompressible Viscous Flowmomentum to the boundary layer through blowing, or by removing low-momentum boundary-layer ﬂuid by suction. Many examples of practical boundary-layer controlsystems may be seen on commercial transport aircraft at your local airport. Two typical systems are shown in Fig. 9.24 . Fig. 9.24 (a) Application of high-lift boundary-layer control devices to reduce landing speed of a jet transport aircraft. The wing of the Boeing 777 is highly mechanized. In the landing conﬁg- uration, large slotted trailing-edge ﬂaps roll out from under the wing and deﬂect downward toincrease wing area and camber, thus increasing the lift coefﬁcient. Slats at the leading edge of thewing move forward and down, to increase the effective radius of the leading edge and prevent ﬂow separation, and to open a slot that helps keep air ﬂow attached to the wing’s upper surface. After touchdown, spoilers (not shown in use) are raised in front of each ﬂap to decrease lift andensure that the plane remains on the ground, despite use of the lift-augmenting devices. (This photograph was taken during a ﬂight test. Flow cones are attached to the ﬂaps and ailerons to identify regions of separated ﬂow on these surfaces.)

VIDEO Leading Edge Slats. 9.8 Lift 467Example 9.8 OPTIMUM CRUISE PERFORMANCE OF A JET TRANSPORT Jet engines burn fuel at a rate proportional to thrust delivered. The optimum cruise condition for a jet aircraft is at maximum speed for a given thrust. In steady level ﬂight, thrust and drag are equal. Hence, optimum cruise occursat the speed when the ratio of drag force to air speed is minimized. A Boeing 727-200 jet transport has wing planform area A p51600 ft2, and aspect ratio AR56:5. Stall speed at sea level for this aircraft with ﬂaps up and a gross weight of 150,000 lbf is 175 mph. Below M50:6, drag due to com- pressibility effects is negligible, so Eq. 9.43 may be used to estimate total drag on the aircraft. CD;0for the aircraft is constant at 0.0182. Assume sonic speed at sea level is c5759 mph. Evaluate the performance envelope for this aircraft at sea level by plotting drag force versus speed, between stall andM50:6. Use this graph to estimate optimum cruise speed for the aircraft at sea-level conditions. Comment on stall speed and optimum cruise speed for the aircraft at 30,000 ft altitude on a standard day.

In the takeoff conﬁguration, large slotted trailing-edge ﬂaps deﬂect to increase the lift coefﬁcient. The low-speed aileron near the wingtip also deﬂects to improve span loading during takeoff.

A road vehicle generates lift by virtue of its shape [29]. A representative centerline pressure distribution measured in the wind tunnel for an automobile is shown in Fig. 9.25 [30]. The pressure is low around the nose because of streamline curvature as the ﬂow rounds the nose. The pressure reaches a maximum at the base of the windshield, againas a result of streamline curvature. Low-pressure regions also occur at the windshieldheader and over the top of the automobile. The air speed across the top is approxi-mately 30 percent higher than the freestream air speed. The same effect occurs aroundThese data may be plotted as: From the plot, the optimum cruise speed at sea level is estimated as 320 mph (and using Excel we obtain 323 mph). At 30,000 ft (9,140 m) altitude, the density is only about 0.375 times sea level density, from Table A.3.

The drag increase caused by an added object, such as an antenna, spotlight, or mirror at that location, thus would be ð1:3Þ2/C251:7 times the drag the object would experience in an undisturbed ﬂow ﬁeld. Thus theparasite drag of an added component can be much higher than would be predicted from its drag calculated for free ﬂow. At high speeds, aerodynamic lift forces can unload tires, causing serious reductions in steering control and reducing stability to a dangerous extent. Lift forces on earlyracing cars were counteracted somewhat by “spoilers,” at considerable penalty indrag. In 1965 Jim Hall introduced the use of movable inverted airfoils on his Chap-arral sports cars to develop aerodynamic downforce and provide aerodynamic braking[31]. Since then the developments in application of aerodynamic devices have beenrapid. Aerodynamic design is used to reduce lift on all modern racing cars, asexempliﬁed in Fig. 9.26 . Liebeck airfoils [23] are used frequently for high-speed automobiles. Their high lift coefﬁcients and relatively low drag allow downforce equalto or greater than the car weight to be developed at racing speeds. “Ground effect”cars use venturi-shaped ducts under the car and side skirts to seal leakage ﬂows. Thenet result of these aerodynamic effects is that the downward force (which increaseswith speed) generates excellent traction without adding signiﬁcant weight to thevehicle, allowing faster speeds through curves and leading to lower lap times. Another method of boundary-layer control is use of moving surfaces to reduce skin friction effects on the boundary layer [32]. This method is hard to apply to practical devices, because of geometric and weight complications, but it is very important in recreation. Most golfers, tennis players, soccer players, and baseball pitchers canattest to this! Tennis and soccer players use spin to control the trajectory and bounceof a shot. In golf, a drive can leave the tee at 275 ft/s or more, with backspin of 9000rpm! Spin provides signiﬁcant aerodynamic lift that substantially increases the carry ofa drive. Spin is also largely responsible for hooking and slicing when shots are not hitsquarely. The baseball pitcher uses spin to throw a curve ball. Flow about a spinning sphere is shown in Fig.9.27 a. Spin alters the pressure distribution and also affects the location of boundary-layer separation. Separation is delayed on theupper surface of the sphere in Fig. 9.27 a, and it occurs earlier on the lower surface. Thus pressure(becauseof the Bernoulli effect)isreducedontheuppersurface and increased onthe lower surface; the wake is deﬂected downward as shown. Pressure forces cause a lift inthe direction shown; spin in the opposite direction would produce negative lift—adownward force. The force is directed perpendicular to both Vand the spin axis. Lift and drag data for spinning smooth spheres are presented in Fig. 9.27 b. The most important parameter is the spin ratio ,ωD/2V, the ratio of surface speed to Fig. 9.26 Contemporary racing car (Schumacher’s Formula 1 Ferrari) showing aero- dynamic features. The car’s front and rear wings are designed to provide signiﬁcant downforce at speed to improve traction. Also visible are fairings to direct hot air from the radiators around the rear tires, and at the front of the car, cool air toward the brakes. Notshown are other aerodynamic features such as the fuselage bottom, which is designed to route the airﬂow carefully, using diffusers, to develop the most negative pressure, and to cause this negative pressure to act over the largest possible area under the car, todevelop additional downforce. (Photograph rWayne P. Johnson)9.8 Lift 471freestream ﬂow speed; Reynolds number plays a secondary role. At low spin ratio, lift is negative in terms of the directions shown in Fig. 9.27 a. Only above ωD=2V/C250:5 does lift become positive and continue to increase as spin ratio increases. Lift coef-ﬁcient levels out at about 0.35. Spin has little effect on sphere drag coefﬁcient, whichvaries from about 0.5 to about 0.65 over the range of spin ratio shown. Earlier we mentioned the effect of dimples on the drag of a golf ball. Experimental data for lift and drag coefﬁcients for spinning golf balls are presented in Fig. 9.28 for subcritical Reynolds numbers between 126,000 and 238,000. Again the independent variable is spin ratio; a much smaller range of spin ratio, typical of golf balls, is pre- sented in Fig. 9.28. A clear trend is evident: The lift coefﬁcient increases consistently with spin ratio for both hexagonal and “conventional” (round) dimples. The lift coefﬁcient on a golf ball with hexagonal dimples is signiﬁcantly—as much as 15 percent—higher than on a ball with round dimples. The advantage for hexagonal dimples continues to the largestspin ratios that were measured. The drag coefﬁcient for a ball with hexagonal dimples isconsistently 5 to 7 percent lower than the drag coefﬁcient for a ball with round dimples at low spin ratios, but the difference becomes less pronounced as spin ratio increases.CD CLCL and CD ConventionalConventional HexHex 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.05 Spin ratio, D/2V0.02 0.0100.10.20.30.4 ω2.38 2.171.951.711.491.26Re /H11003 10–5 Fig. 9.28 Comparison of conventional and hex-dimpled golf balls [33].ω WakeVLift force, FL (a) Flow pattern (b) Lift and drag coefficientsSpin ratio, ωD/2V10.20.40.6 2345Re 6.2 /H11003 104 7.7 /H11003 104 10.7 /H11003 104CD CLCL and CD Fig. 9.27 Flow pattern, lift, and drag coefﬁcients for a smooth spinning sphere in uniform ﬂow. (Data from [19].)472 Chapter 9External Incompressible Viscous FlowThe combination of higher lift and lower drag increases the carry of a golf shot. A recent design—the Callaway HX—has improved performance further by using a “tubular lattice network” using ridges of hexagons and pentagons (at a precise height of 0.0083 in.) instead of dimples, so that there are no ﬂat spots at all on the surface [34]. Callaway claims the HX ﬂies farther than any ball they ever tested.

This effect, known as the Magnus effect , is responsible for the systematic drift of artillery shells. Cross ﬂow about a rotating circular cylinder is qualitatively similar to ﬂow about the spinning sphere shown schematically in Fig. 9.27 a. If the velocity of the upper surface of a cylinder is in the same direction as the freestream velocity, separation isdelayed on the upper surface; it occurs earlier on the lower surface. Thus the wakeis deﬂected and the pressure distribution on the cylinder surface is altered whenrotation is present. Pressure is reduced on the upper surface and increased on thelower surface, causing a net lift force acting upward. Spin in the opposite directionreverses these effects and causes a downward lift force. Lift and drag coefﬁcients for the rotating cylinder are based on projected area, LD. Experimentally measured lift and drag coefﬁcients for subcritical Reynolds numbers between 40,000 and 660,000 are shown as functions of spin ratio in Fig. 9.29 . When surface speed exceeds ﬂow speed, the lift coefﬁcient increases to surprisingly high values, while in two-dimensional ﬂow, drag is affected only moderately. Induced drag,which must be considered for ﬁnite cylinders, can be reduced by using end disks largerin diameter than the body of the cylinder. The power required to rotate a cylinder may be estimated from the skin friction drag of the cylinder surface. Hoerner [35] suggests basing the skin friction drag esti-mate on the tangential surface speed and surface area. Goldstein [19] suggests that the power required to spin the cylinder, when expressed as an equivalent drag coefﬁcient, may represent 20 percent or more of the aerodynamic C Dof a stationary cylinder.VFL ω ωCL CL CDData band 6 5 4 3 Spin ratio, D/2V2 1 0–2024681012CL and CD Fig. 9.29 Lift and drag of a rotating cylinder as a function of relative rotational speed; Magnus force.

In Chapter 5 we developed the Navier /C0Stokes equa- tions for describing many of the ﬂow ﬁelds that we arelikely to study, and in Chapter 6 we developed Euler’sequation and the Bernoulli equation, which are usefulwhen analyzing ﬂows we can model as inviscid, such asmuch of aerodynamics. In Chapter 9 we have expanded on this material, considering many real-world phe- nomena such as boundary layers, ﬂow separation, andso on. However, we still have a lot to learn about lots ofdifferent ﬂow problems. For example, it is conventionalknowledge that airfoils and hydrofoils should haveleading edges that are smooth and streamlined—eveninsect debris stuck to the leading edge of a wind tur-bine rotor, for example, can reduce performance. However, Dr. Frank E. Fish at West Chester University, Pennsylvania, and research colleagues at Duke Uni-versity and the U.S. Naval Academy have studied theﬂuid mechanics of the ﬂippers of the humpback whale,which are anything but smooth, as shown in the ﬁgure.The researchers were curious that even allowing forthe natural variability that any animal’s proﬁle wouldhave, the whale seems to have evolved ﬂippers that have a unique row of bumps, or tubercles, along their leading edges that produce a serrated look. What are the bumps doing on those ﬂippers? Test- ing and analysis (using many of the ideas discussed inChapters 5, 6, and 9) have been done comparing air-foils with tubercles to similar airfoils with a traditionalsmooth leading edge. This research showed thatthe stall angle (recall that this is the angle when ﬂow separation occurs, leading to a sudden loss in lift) was greatly increased and that when stall occurs, it doesso gradually, not suddenly as in most traditional air-foils. In addition, the tubercles airfoil was more efﬁ-cient: It had signiﬁcantly less drag and more lift. It’s believed that this occurs because the tubercles channel the wind as it hits the leading edge of theairfoil, causing vortices to develop as the ﬂow moves along the airfoil surface, stabilizing the ﬂow and,476 Chapter 9External Incompressible Viscous FlowReferences 1.Prandtl, L., “Fluid Motion with Very Small Friction (in German),” Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Mathematics , Heidelberg, 1904; English translation available as NACA TM 452, March 1928. 2.Blasius, H., “The Boundary Layers in Fluids with Little Friction (in German),” Zeitschrift fu ¨r Mathematik und Physik, 56, 1, 1908, pp. 1 /C037; English translation available as NACA TM 1256, February 1950.3.Schlichting, H., Boundary-Layer Theory , 7th ed.

Problems The Boundary-Layer Concept 9.1The roof of a minivan is approximated as a horizontal ﬂat plate. Plot the length of the laminar boundary layer as a function of minivan speed, V, as the minivan accelerates from 10 mph to 90 mph. 9.2 A model of a river towboat is to be tested at 1:18 scale. The boat is designed to travel at 3.5 m/s in fresh water at 10/C14C. Estimate the distance from the bow where transition occurs. Where should transition be stimulated on the model towboat? 9.3 The takeoff speed of a Boeing 757 is 160 mph. At approximately what distance will the boundary layer on the wings become turbulent? If it cruises at 530 mph at 33,000 ft, at approximately what distance will the boundary layer onthe wings become turbulent? 9.4 A student is to design an experiment involving dragging a sphere through a tank of ﬂuid to illustrate (a) “creeping ﬂow” ( ReD,1) and (b) ﬂow for which the boundary layer becomes turbulent ( ReD/C252.53105). She proposes to use a smooth sphere of diameter 1 cm in SAE 10 oil at room temperature. Is this realistic for both cases? If either case is unrealistic, select an alternative reasonable sphere diameterand common ﬂuid for that case. 9.5 For ﬂow around a sphere the boundary layer becomes turbulent around ReD/C252.53105. Find the speeds at which (a) an American golf ball ( D51:68 in.), (b) a British golf ball ( D541:1mm), and (c) a soccer ball ( D58:75 in.) develop turbulent boundary layers.

At the trailing edge,the boundary-layer thickness is δ51 in. Assume the velocity proﬁle is linear, as shown, and that the ﬂow is two-dimensional (ﬂow conditions are independent of z). Using control volume abcd, shown by the dashed lines, compute the mass ﬂow rate across surface ab. Determine the drag force on the upper surface of the plate.

Why? The trailing edge boundary-layer thickness is now δ50.6 in. Assume again that the velocity proﬁle is linear and that the ﬂow is two- dimensional (ﬂow conditions are independent of z). Repeat the analysis of Problem 9.18. 9.20 Solve Problem 9.18 again with the velocity proﬁle at section bcgiven by the parabolic expression from Problem 9.10. 9.21 The test section of a low-speed wind tunnel is 5 ft long, preceded by a nozzle with a diffuser at the outlet. The tunnelcross section is 1 ft 31 ft. The wind tunnel is to operate with 100 /C14F air and have a design velocity of 160 ft/s in the test section. A potential problem with such a wind tunnel isboundary-layer blockage. The boundary-layer displacementthickness reduces the effective cross-sectional area (the testarea, in which we have uniform ﬂow); in addition, the uni- form ﬂow will be accelerated. If these effects are pro- nounced, we end up with a smaller useful test cross sectionwith a velocity somewhat higher than anticipated. If the boundary layer thickness is 0.4 in. at the entrance and 1 in. at the exit, and the boundary layer velocity proﬁle is given byu=U5ðy=δÞ 1=7, estimate the displacement thickness at the end of the test section and the percentage change inthe uniform velocity between the inlet and outlet. 9.22 Air ﬂows in a horizontal cylindrical duct of diameter D5100 mm. At a section a few meters from the entrance, the turbulent boundary layer is of thickness δ155.25 mm, and the velocity in the inviscid central core is U1512.5 m/s. Farther downstream the boundary layer is of thickness δ25 24 mm. The velocity proﬁle in the boundary layer is approximated well by the1 7-power expression. Find the velocity, U2, in the inviscid central core at the second section, and the pressure drop between the two sections. 9.23 Laboratory wind tunnels have test sections 25 cm square and 50 cm long. With nominal air speed U1525 m/s at the test section inlet, turbulent boundary layers form on the top, bot- tom, and side walls of the tunnel. The boundary-layer thickness isδ1520 mm at the inlet and δ2530 mm at the outlet from the test section. The boundary-layer velocity proﬁles are of power-law form, with u/U5(y/δ)1/7. Evaluate the freestream velocity, U2, at the exit from the wind-tunnel test section. Determine the change in static pressure along the test section. 9.24 The square test section of a small laboratory wind tunnel has sides of width W540 cm. At one measurement location, the turbulent boundary layers on the tunnel walls areδ151 cm thick. The velocity proﬁle is approximated well by the1 7-power expression. At this location, the freestream air speed is U1520 m/s, and the static pressure is p152250 Pa (gage). At a second measurement location downstream, the boundary layer thickness is δ251.3 cm. Evaluate the air speed in the freestream in the second section.

Evaluate the free- stream air speed at the outlet from the test section. Determine the static pressures at the test section inlet and outlet. 9.28 Flow of air develops in a horizontal cylindrical duct, of diameter D515 in., following a well-rounded entrance. A turbulent boundary grows on the duct wall, but the ﬂow is notyet fully developed. Assume that the velocity proﬁle in theboundary layer is u=U5ðy=δÞ 1=7. The inlet ﬂow is U550 ft/s at section 1. At section 2, the boundary-layer thickness is δ254 in. Evaluate the static gage pressure at section 2, located at L520 ft. Find the average wall shear stress. 9.29 Air ﬂows into the inlet contraction section of a wind tunnel in an undergraduate laboratory. From the inlet the air enters the test section, which is square in cross-section with side dimensions of 305 mm. The test section is 609 mm long.At one operating condition air leaves the contraction at 50.2 m/s with negligible boundary-layer thickness. Measurements show that boundary layers at the downstream end of the testsection are 20.3 mm thick. Evaluate the displacement thickness of the boundary layers at the downstream end of the wind tunnel test section. Calculate the change in staticpressure along the wind tunnel test section.

On one graph, plot the laminar boundary-layer thickness as a function of distance along the plate (up to transition) for freestream speeds U51 m/s, 2 m/s, 3 m/s, 4 m/s, 5 m/s, and 10 m/s. *9.37 The Blasius exact solution involves solving a nonlinear equation, Eq. 9.11, with initial and boundary conditions given by Eq. 9.12. Set up an Excel workbook to obtain a numerical solution of this system. The workbook should consist of columnsforη,f,fu,a n d fv. The rows should consist of values of these, with a suitable step size for η(e.g., for 1000 rows the step size for ηwould be 0.01 to generate data through η510, to go a little beyond the data in Table 9.1 ). The values of fandfufor the ﬁrst row are zero (from the initial conditions, Eq. 9.12); a guess valueis needed for fv(try 0.5). Subsequent row values for f,fu,a n d fv can be obtained from previous row values using the Eulermethod of Section 5.5 for approximating ﬁrst derivatives (and Eq. 9.11). Finally, a solution can be found by using Excel’ sGoal Seek orSolver functions to vary the initial value of fvuntilfu51 for large η(e.g., η510, boundary condition of Eq. 9.12). Plot the results.

Evaluate θLb and the total drag for the given conditions. 9.40 A thin ﬂat plate is installed in a water tunnel as a splitter. The plate is 0.3 m long and 1 m wide. The freestream speed is 1.6 m/s. Laminar boundary layers form on both sides of the plate. The boundary-layer velocity proﬁle is approxi- mated as parabolic. Determine the total viscous drag forceon the plate assuming that pressure drag is negligible. 9.41 In Problems 9.18 and 9.19 the drag on the upper surface of a ﬂat plate, with ﬂow (ﬂuid density ρ51.5 slug/ft3)a t freestream speed U510 ft/s, was determined from momen- tum ﬂux calculations.

Assume the strut is L5 40 mm long and d53 mm in. diameter. Solve Problem 9.107 including the effect of drag on the support. 9.134 A tennis ball with a mass of 57 g and diameter of 64 mm is dropped in standard sea level air. Calculate the terminal velocity of the ball. Assuming as an approximation that thedrag coefﬁcient remains constant at its terminal-velocity value, estimate the time and distance required for the ball to reach 95% of its terminal speed. 9.135 Consider a cylindrical ﬂag pole of height H. For con- stant drag coefﬁcient, evaluate the drag force and bending moment on the pole if wind speed varies as u/U5(y/H)1/7, where yis distance measured from the ground. Compare with drag and moment for a uniform wind proﬁle with con- stant speed U. 9.136 A water tower consists of a 12-m-diameter sphere on top of a vertical tower 30 m tall and 2 m in diameter. Esti-mate the bending moment exerted on the base of the towerdue to the aerodynamic force imposed by a 100 km/hr wind on a standard day. Neglect interference at the joint between the sphere and tower. 9.137 A model airfoil of chord 15 cm and span 60 cm is placed in a wind tunnel with an air ﬂow of 30 m/s (the air is at 20/C14C). It is mounted on a cylindrical support rod 2 cm in diameter and 25 cm tall. Instruments at the base of the rod indicate a vertical force of 50 N and a horizontal force of 6 N. Calculate the lift and drag coefﬁcients of the airfoil. 9.138 A cast-iron “12-pounder” cannonball rolls off the deck of a ship and falls into the ocean at a location where thedepth is 1000 m.

Use these data to estimate CDfor this ﬂow. Compare with data from Fig. 9.13 . How can you explain the difference? 9.141 Consider the tennis ball of Problem 9.134. Use the equations for drag coefﬁcient given in Problem 9.132, and anumerical integration scheme (e.g., Simpson’s rule) to com- pute the time and distance required for the ball to reach 95% of its terminal speed. 9.142 The air bubble of Problem 3.10 expands as it rises in water.

Esti- mate the maximum height of the ball, assuming (a) a con- stant drag coefﬁcient and (b) using the equations for drag coefﬁcient given in Problem 9.132, and a numerical inte-gration scheme (e.g., a Simpson’s rule). 9.144 Why is it possible to kick a football farther in a spiral motion than in an end-over-end tumbling motion? 9.145 Approximate dimensions of a rented rooftop carrier are shown.

The max- imum ﬂap setting that can be used at takeoff corresponds toconﬁguration 2in Fig. 9.23. Determine the maximum gross mass possible for the airplane if its takeoff speed is 150 km/hrat sea level (neglect added lift due to ground effect). Find theminimum takeoff speed required for this gross mass ifthe airplane is instead taking off from Denver (elevation approximately 1.6 km). 9.161 An aircraft is in level ﬂight at 225 km/hr through air at standard conditions.

If the craft is ﬁtted with a 150-hp engine, estimateits top speed. 9.163 A high school project involves building a model ultralight airplane. Some of the students propose making an airfoil from a sheet of plastic 5 ft long 37 ft wide at an angle of attack of 10/C14. At this airfoil’s aspect ratio and angle of attack the lift and drag coefﬁcients are CL50.75 and CD5 0.19. If the airplane is designed to ﬂy at 40 ft/s, what is the maximum total payload? What will be the required power tomaintain ﬂight? Does this proposal seem feasible? 9.164 The U.S. Air Force F-16 ﬁghter aircraft has wing planform area A5300 ft2; it can achieve a maximum lift coefﬁcient of CL51.6. When fully loaded, its weight is 26,000 lb. The airframe is capable of maneuvers that produce9gvertical accelerations. However, student pilots are restricted to 5 gmaneuvers during training. Consider a turn ﬂown in level ﬂight with the aircraft banked. Find theminimum speed in standard air at which the pilot can pro- duce a 5 gtotal acceleration. Calculate the corresponding ﬂight radius. Discuss the effect of altitude on these results. 9.165 The teacher of the students designing the airplane of Problem 9.163 is not happy with the idea of using a sheet of plastic for the airfoil. He asks the students to evaluate the expected maximum total payload, and required power to maintain ﬂight, if the sheet of plastic is replaced with a con-ventional section (NACA 23015) airfoil with the same aspectratio and angle of attack. What are the results of the analysis? 9.166 A light airplane, with mass M51000 kg, has a con- ventional-section (NACA 23015) wing of planform area A5 10 m2. Find the angle of attack of the wing for a cruising speed of V563 m/s. What is the required power? Find the maximum instantaneous vertical “g force” experienced atcruising speed if the angle of attack is suddenly increased. 9.167 A light airplane has 35-ft effective wingspan and 5.5-ft chord. It was originally designed to use a conventional(NACA 23015) airfoil section. With this airfoil, its cruising speed on a standard day near sea level is 150 mph. A con- version to a laminar-ﬂow (NACA 66 2/C0215) section airfoil is proposed. Determine the cruising speed that could beachieved with the new airfoil section for the same power. 9.168 Instead of a new laminar-ﬂow airfoil, a redesign of the light airplane of Problem 9.167 is proposed in whichthe current conventional airfoil section is replaced withanother conventional airfoil section of the same area, butwith aspect ratio AR58. Determine the cruising speed that could be achieved with this new airfoil for the same power. 9.169 Assume the Boeing 727 aircraft has wings with NACA 23012 section, planform area of 1600 ft2, double-slotted ﬂaps, and effective aspect ratio of 6.5. If the aircraft ﬂies at 150knots in standard air at 175,000 lb gross weight, estimate the thrust required to maintain level ﬂight. 9.170 An airplane with mass of 10,000 lb is ﬂown at constant elevation and speed on a circular path at 150 mph. The ﬂightcircle has a radius of 3250 ft. The plane has lifting area of 225 ft2and is ﬁtted with NACA 23015 section airfoils with effective aspect ratio of 7. Estimate the drag on the aircraft and the power required. 9.171 Find the minimum and maximum speeds at which the airplane of Problem 9.170 can ﬂy on a 3250 ft radius circular ﬂight path, and estimate the drag on the aircraft and power required at these extremes. 9.172 Jim Hall’s Chaparral 2F sports-racing cars in the 1960s pioneered use of airfoils mounted above the rear suspension to enhance stability and improve braking performance. The airfoil was effectively 6 ft wide (span) and had a 1-ft chord. Its angle of attack was variable between 0 and minus 12degrees. Assume lift and drag coefﬁcient data are given by curves (for conventional section) in Fig. 9.17 . Consider a car speed of 120 mph on a calm day. For an airfoil deﬂection of 12 /C14down, calculate (a) the maximum downward force and (b) the maximum increase in deceleration force produced by the airfoil. 9.173 The glide angle for unpowered ﬂight is such that lift, drag, and weight are in equilibrium. Show that the glide slope angle, θ, is such that tan θ5CD/CL. The minimum glide slope occurs at the speed where CL/CDis a maximum.

How far could this aircraft glide from an initial altitude of 10 km on a standard day? 9.174 The wing loading of the Gossamer Condor is 0.4 lbf/ft2 of wing area.

Investigate the validity of this claim. Are these devices really just cosmetic? 9.176 Roadside signs tend to oscillate in a twisting motion when a strong wind blows. Discuss the phenomena that must occur to cause this behavior. 9.177 How does a FrisbeeTMﬂy? What causes it to curve left or right? What is the effect of spin on its ﬂight? 9.178 Air moving over an automobile is accelerated to speeds higher than the travel speed, as shown in Fig. 9.25 . This causes changes in interior pressure when windows are opened or closed. Use the data of Fig. 9.25 to estimate thepressure reduction when a window is opened slightly at aspeed of 100 km/hr. What is the air speed in the freestream near the window opening? 9.179 An automobile travels down the road with a bicycle attached to a carrier across the rear of the trunk. The bicycle wheels rotate slowly. Explain why and in what direction the rotation occurs. 9.180 A class demonstration showed that lift is present when a cylinder rotates in an air stream. A string wrapped around490 Chapter 9External Incompressible Viscous Flowa paper cylinder and pulled causes the cylinder to spin and move forward simultaneously. Assume a cylinder of 5 cmdiameter and 30 cm length is given a rotational speed of 240 rpm and a forward speed of 1.5 m/s. Estimate the approx- imate lift force that acts on the cylinder. 9.181 A golf ball (diameter D543 mm) with circular dimples is hit from a sand trap at 20 m/s with backspin of 2000 rpm. The mass of the ball is 48 g. Evaluate the lift and drag forces acting on the ball. Express your results as frac-tions of the weight of the ball. 9.182 Rotating cylinders were proposed as a means of ship propulsion in 1924 by the German engineer, Flettner. Theoriginal Flettner rotor ship had two rotors, each about 10 ftin diameter and 50 ft high, rotating at up to 800 rpm. Cal- culate the maximum lift and drag forces that act on each rotor in a 30-mph wind. Compare the total force to thatproduced at the optimum L/Dat the same wind speed.

Ernst van Nierop, a PhD candidate at the School of Engineering andApplied Sciences at Harvard University, coauthored astudy to explain this phenomenon with mathematicsprofessor Michael Brenner and researcher Silas Alben. As with the airfoils discussed in Chapter 9, when the angle of attack of a whale ﬂipper becomes too steep,the result is stall. Previous experiments have shown,however, that the angle of attack before stall occursfor a humpback-whale ﬂipper is much steeper thanthat of a smooth ﬂipper. The Harvard team showed thatthe tubercles change the distribution of pressure on theﬂipper so that some parts of it stall before others, thereby avoiding abrupt stalling and giving the whale more freedom to attack at higher angles and the abilityto better predict its hydrodynamic limitations. Studying living things in order to come up with ideas to improve technology is a practice known asbiomimicry , and it is becoming more widely used to increase efﬁciency in machines. In this instance wehave a practical application of tubercle technology, speciﬁcally as it applies to turbomachinery, the topic of this chapter. A company in Toronto, Ontario, called 492Humans have sought to control nature since antiquity. Early humans carried water by the bucket; as larger groups formed, this process was mechanized. The ﬁrst ﬂuidmachines developed as bucket wheels and screw pumps to lift water. The Romansintroduced paddle wheels around 70 B.C. to obtain energy from streams [1]. Later,windmills were developed to harness wind power, but the low power density of thewind limited output to a few hundred horsepower. Development of waterwheels madeit possible to extract thousands of horsepower at a single site. Today we take many ﬂuid machines for granted. On a typical day we draw pres- surized water from the tap, use a blower to dry our hair, drive a car (in which ﬂuidmachines operate the lubrication, cooling, and power steering systems), and work in acomfortable environment provided by air circulation. The list could be extendedindeﬁnitely. A ﬂuid machine is a device that either performs work on or extracts work (or power) from a ﬂuid. As you can imagine, this is a very large ﬁeld of study, so we willlimit ourselves mostly to incompressible ﬂows. First the terminology of the ﬁeld isintroduced and machines are classiﬁed by operating principle and physical character- istics. Rather than attempt a treatment of the entire ﬁeld, we focus on machines in which energy transfer to or from the ﬂuid is through a rotating element. Basic equa-tions are reviewed and then simpliﬁed to forms useful for analysis of ﬂuid machines.Performance characteristics of typical machines are considered. Examples are given ofWhalePower , has demonstrated the advantages of tubercles when they are integrated into the leadingedges of wind-turbine and fan blades. The photographshows a prototype of a wind turbine blade incorpor-ating tubercles on its leading edge. Tests of theseprototypes have shown that the delayed stall doubles the performance of the turbines and allows the turbine to capture more energy out of lower-speed winds. Aswe alluded to in the Case Study of Chapter 9, this increase in performance can be explained by lookingat how stall affects the ﬂow over rotating blades. Inparticular, it is well-known that the stall experiencedby conventional blades causes air to travel from thehub to the tips of the blades, rather than parallel tothe axis of rotation. The result of this effect, sometimesreferred to as span-wise pumping, is that additional energy is needed to move the air in the desireddirection, decreasing efﬁciency of the fan. Similarly, awind turbine that experiences stall will generate lesslift, and therefore less power can extracted from theair. In addition, the radial component of the air ﬂow increases vibration of the blades, causing noise and increased wear and tear. Ongoing tests at the Wind Energy Institute of Canada have shown that because the tubercle-linedblades delay stall, they are more stable, quiet, anddurable than conventional blades. Recent studiesshow that the addition of tubercles to the leadingedges of turbine blades makes them generate more stable lift, with lower drag even at high pitch angles, and when there is stall it is a gradual, not catastrophic,change. WhalePower claims that there is improved power generation at low wind speeds, the bladesare quieter than conventional blades, and there isdecreased tip chatter (vibrations at the blade tip dueto ﬂow instabilities); in other words, in real-worldconditions the tubercle-enhanced blades appear to be more stable and responsive than any previous turbine. WhalePower has also shown that tubercle-lined blades on industrial ceiling fans can operate 20 per-cent more efﬁciently than conventional blades andthat they do a better job at circulating air in a building.The results were dramatic enough to convince Envira-North, Canada’s largest maker of ventilation fans, tolicense the design.

Next, we will discuss propellers and wind turbines, which are unique in that they achieve energy transfer with a ﬂuidwithout the beneﬁt of an external housing. A discussion of compressible ﬂow machines concludes the chapter. 10.1 Introduction and Classi ﬁcation of Fluid Machines Fluid machines may be broadly classiﬁed as either positive displacement ordynamic .I n positive-displacement machines, energy transfer is accomplished by volume changes that occur due to movement of the boundary in which the ﬂuid is conﬁned. This includespiston-cylinder arrangements, gear pumps (for example, the oil pump for a car engine),and lobe pumps (for example, those used in medicine for circulating blood through amachine). We will not analyze these devices in this chapter; we will review them brieﬂy in Section 10.4. Dynamic ﬂuid-handling devices that direct the ﬂow with blades or vanes attached to a rotating member are termed turbomachines . In contrast to positive dis- placement machinery, there is no closed volume in a turbomachine. These devices arevery widely used in industry for power generation (for example, water and steam tur-bines) and in numerous other applications (for example, the turbocharger of a high-performance car). The emphasis in this chapter is on dynamic machines. A further distinction among types of turbomachines is based on the geometry of the ﬂow path. In radial-ﬂow machines, the ﬂow path is essentially radial, with signiﬁcant changes in radius from inlet to outlet. (Such machines sometimes are called centrifugal machines.) In axial-ﬂow machines, the ﬂow path is nearly parallel to the machine centerline, and the radius of the ﬂow path does not vary signiﬁcantly. In mixed-ﬂow machines the ﬂow-path radius changes only moderately. Diagrams and photographs oftypical turbomachines are shown in Figs. 10.1 through 10.5. All work interactions in a turbomachine result from dynamic effects of the rotor on the ﬂuid stream; that is, the transfer of work between the ﬂuid and the rotatingmachine either increases or decreases the speed of the ﬂow. However, in conjunction with this kinetic energy transfer, machines that include external housings (e.g., com- pressors, pumps, and turbines) also involve either the conversion of pressure energy tokinetic energy, or vice versa. This acceleration or deceleration of the ﬂow allows formaximum pressure rise in pumps and compressors and for maximum power outputfrom turbines. Machines for Doing Work on a Fluid Machines that add energy to a ﬂuid by performing work on it are called pumps when the ﬂow is liquid or slurry, and fans,blowers ,o r compressors for gas- or vapor- handling units, depending on pressure rise. Fans usually have small pressure rise (lessthan 1 inch of water) and blowers have moderate pressure rise (perhaps 1 inch ofmercury); pumps and compressors may have very high pressure rises. Currentindustrial systems operate at pressures up to 150,000 psi (10 4atmospheres). Pumps and compressors consist of a rotating wheel (called an impeller orrotor , depending on the type of machine) driven by an external power source (e.g., a motoror another ﬂuid machine) to increase the ﬂow kinetic energy, followed by an elementto decelerate the ﬂow, thereby increasing its pressure. This combination is known as astage . These elements are contained within a housing orcasing . A single pump or compressor might consist of several stages within a single housing, depending onthe amount of pressure rise required of the machine. The shaft must penetrate the494 Chapter 10Fluid Machineryhousing in order to receive mechanical work from the external power source. Bearings and seals are needed to minimize frictional (mechanical) losses and prevent leakage ofthe working ﬂuid. Three typical centrifugal machines are shown schematically in Fig. 10.1. The rotating element of a centrifugal pump or compressor is frequently called the impeller.Flow enters each machine nearly axially at small radius through the eyeof the impeller, diagram ( a), at radius r Flow is turned and leaves through the impeller discharge at radius r2, where the width is b2. Diffusion of the ﬂow is achieved in a centrifugal machine as it leaves the impeller and is collected in the scroll orvolute , which gradually increases in area as it nears the outlet of the machine, diagram ( b). The impeller usually has vanes; it may be shrouded (enclosed) as shown in diagram (a), or open as shown in diagram ( c). The impeller vanes may be relatively straight, or they may curve to become nonradial at the outlet. Diagram ( c) shows that the diffuser may have vanes to direct the ﬂow between the impeller discharge and the volute;vanes allow for more efﬁcient diffusion, but at increased fabrication cost. Centrifugalmachines are capable of higher pressure ratios than axial machines, but they have a higher frontal area per unit mass ﬂow. Typical axial-ﬂow and mixed-ﬂow turbomachines are shown schematically in Fig. 10.2. Figure 10.2 ashows a typical axial-ﬂow compressor stage. In these machines the rotating element is referred to as the rotor, and ﬂow diffusion is achieved in the stator. Flow enters nearly parallel to the rotor axis and maintains nearly the sameradius through the stage.

As a result, axial ﬂow machines are more likely to consist of multiple stages, making them more complex than centrifugal machines. Figure 10.3 shows a multiple-stage axial ﬂow compressor. In this photo- graph, the outer housing (to which the stator vanes are attached) has been removed,clearly showing the rows of rotor vanes. The pressure rise that can be achieved efﬁciently in a single stage is limited, depending on the type of machine. The reason for this limitation can be understoodbased on the pressure gradients in these machines (see Section 9.6). In a pump orcompressor, the boundary layer subjected to an adverse pressure gradient is notstable; so ﬂow is more likely to encounter boundary-layer separation in a compressor or pump. Boundary-layer separation increases the drag on the impeller, resulting in a decrease in efﬁciency; therefore additional work is needed to compress the ﬂow. Fans, blowers, compressors, and pumps are found in many sizes and types, ranging from simple household units to complex industrial units of large capacity. Torque andpower requirements for idealized pumps and turboblowers can be analyzed byapplying the angular-momentum principle using a suitable control volume. Propellers are essentially axial-ﬂow devices that operate without an outer housing. Propellers may be designed to operate in gases or liquids. As you might expect, pro- pellers designed for these very different applications are quite distinct. Marine propellers tend to have wide blades compared with their radii, giving high solidity .A i r c r a f tp r o - pellers tend to have long, thin blades with rel atively low solidity. These machines will be discussed in detail in Section 10.6. Machines for Extracting Work (Power) from a Fluid Machines that extract energy from a ﬂuid in the form of work (or power) are calledturbines .I nhydraulic turbines , the working ﬂuid is water, so the ﬂow is incompressible. Ingas turbines andsteam turbines , the density of the working ﬂuid may change sig- niﬁcantly. In a turbine, a stage normally consists of an element to accelerate the ﬂow,converting some of its pressure energy to kinetic energy, followed by a rotor ,wheel ,o r Fig. 10.3 Photograph of a multiple-stage axial-ﬂow compressor rotor for a gas turbine.

The two most general classiﬁcations of turbines are impulse and reaction turbines. Impulse turbines are driven by one or more high-speed free jets. The classic example of an impulse turbine is the waterwheel. In a waterwheel, the jets of water are driven by gravity; the kinetic energy of the water is transferred to the wheel, resulting inwork. In more modern forms of impulse turbines, the jet is accelerated in a nozzleexternal to the turbine wheel. If friction and gravity are neglected, neither the ﬂuidpressure nor speed relative to the runner changes as the ﬂuid passes over the turbinebuckets. Thus for an impulse turbine, the ﬂuid acceleration and accompanying pres-sure drop take place in nozzles external to the blades, and the runner does not ﬂow full of ﬂuid; work is extracted as a result of the large momentum change of the ﬂuid. Inreaction turbines , part of the pressure change takes place externally and part takes place within the moving blades. External acceleration occurs and the ﬂow is turned to enter the runner in the proper direction as it passes through nozzles orstationary blades, called guide vanes orwicket gates . Additional ﬂuid acceleration relative to the rotor occurs within the moving blades, so both the relative velocity andthe pressure of the stream change across the runner. Because reaction turbines ﬂowfull of ﬂuid, they generally can produce more power for a given overall size than impulse turbines. Figure 10.4 shows turbines used for different applications. Figure 10.4 ashows a Pelton wheel, a type of impulse turbine wheel used in hydroelectric power plants. Figure 10.4 bis a photograph of an axial steam turbine rotor, an example of a reaction turbine. Figure 10.4 cis a wind turbine farm. A wind turbine is another example of a reaction turbine, but, like a propeller, also operates without an outer housing. Modernwind turbines typically collect wind energy and convert it into electricity. Several typical hydraulic turbines are shown schematically in Fig. 10.5. Figure 10.5 a shows an impulse turbine driven by a single jet, which lies in the plane of the turbinerunner. Water from the jet strikes each bucket in succession, is turned, and leaves thebucket with relative velocity nearly opposite to that with which it entered the bucket.Spent water falls into the tailrace (not shown). A reaction turbine of the Francis type is shown in Fig. 10.5 b. Incoming water ﬂows circumferentially through the turbine casing. It enters the periphery of the stationaryguide vanes and ﬂows toward the runner. Water enters the runner nearly radially andis turned downward to leave nearly axially; the ﬂow pattern may be thought of as a centrifugal pump in reverse. Water leaving the runner ﬂows through a diffuser known as adraft tube before entering the tailrace. Figure 10.5 cshows a propeller turbine of the Kaplan type. The water entry is similar to that in the Francis turbine, but it is (a) Pelton wheel (b) Steam turbine rotor (c) Wind turbine farm Fig. 10.4 Photograph of turbines used in different applications.

Flow leaving the runner may pass through a draft tube. Thus turbines range from simple windmills to complex gas and steam turbines with many stages of carefully designed blading. These devices also can be analyzed inidealized form by applying the angular-momentum principle. The allowable amount of pressure drop in a turbine stage is usually greater than the amount of pressure rise allowable in a compressor stage. The difference is due tothe favorable pressure gradient (see Section 9.6), which makes boundary-layer separa-tion much less likely than in the case of the compressor. Dimensionless parameters, such as speciﬁc speed, ﬂow coefﬁcient, torque coefﬁcient, power coefﬁcient , and pressure ratio , frequently are used to characterize the perfor- mance of turbomachines. These parameters were introduced in Chapter 7; theirdevelopment and use will be considered in more detail later in this chapter. Scope of Coverage According to Japikse [3], “Turbomachinery represents a $400 billion market (possibly much more) with enormous worldwide growth at this time. It is estimated that industrial centrifugal pumps alone consume 5 percent of all the energy produced inthe USA.” In addition, the demands for widely available, economical, green powerwill continue to drive research and development in the turbomachinery industry [4].Therefore, proper design, construction, selection, and application of pumps andcompressors are economically signiﬁcant. Design of actual machines involves diverse technical knowledge, including ﬂuid mechanics, materials, bearings, seals, and vibrations. These topics are covered in numerous specialized texts. Our objective here is to present only enough detail to illustrate the analytical basis of ﬂuid ﬂow design and to discuss brieﬂy the limitationson results obtained from simple analytical models. For more detailed design infor-mation, consult the references. Applications or “system” engineering requires a wealth of experience. Much of this experience must be gained by working with other engineers in the ﬁeld. Our coverageis not intended to be comprehensive; instead we discuss only the most importantconsiderations for successful system application of pumps, compressors, and turbines. The material in this chapter is of a different nature from that in the previous chapters. Chapters 1 through 9 covered much of the fundamental material of ﬂuidmechanics, with detailed analytical results in most cases. This chapter will also involvesigniﬁcant amounts of analysis, but the inherent complexity of the topic means that,on many occasions, we need to resort to empirical results and correlations.

If overall information on ﬂow rate, pressure change, torque, and power is desired, then a ﬁnite-control-volume analysis may beused. If detailed information is desired about blade angles or velocity proﬁles, thenindividual blade elements must be analyzed using an inﬁnitesimal-control-volume orother detailed procedure. We consider only idealized ﬂow processes in this book, sowe concentrate on the approach using the ﬁnite control volume, applying the angular-momentum principle. The analysis that follows applies to machines both for doingwork on, and extracting work from, a ﬂuid ﬂow. The Angular-Momentum Principle: The Euler Turbomachine Equation The angular-momentum principle was applied to ﬁnite control volumes in Chapter 4. The result was Eq. 4.46. ~r3~Fs1Z CV~r3~gρdV---1~Tshaft5@ @tZ CV~r3~VρdV---1Z CS~r3~Vρ~V/C1d~A ð4:46Þ Equation 4.46 states that the moment of surface forces and body forces, plus theapplie d torque, lead to a change in the angular momentum of the ﬂow. [The surface forces are due to friction and pressure, the body force is due to gravity, the appliedtorque could be positive or negative (depending on whether we are doing work on orextracting work from the ﬂuid, respectively), and the angular-momentum change canarise as a change in angular momentum within the control volume, or ﬂux of angularmomentum across the control surface.] We will now simplify Eq. 4.46 for analysis of turbomachinery. First, it is convenient to choose a ﬁxed control volume enclosing the rotor to evaluate shaft torque. Becausewe are looking at control volumes for which we expect large shaft torques, as a ﬁrstapproximation torques due to surface forces may be ignored. This means we areneglecting friction and torque generated by pressure changes. The body force may beneglected by symmetry. Then, for steady ﬂow, Eq. 4.46 becomes ~T shaft5Z CS~r3~Vρ~V/C1d~A ð10:1aÞ Equation 10.1a states: For a turbomachine with work input , the torque required causes a change in the ﬂuid angular momentum; for a turbomachine with work output , the torque produced is due to the change in ﬂuid angular momentum. Let us write this equation in scalar form and illustrate its application to axial- and radial-ﬂow machines. As shown in Fig. 10.6, we select a ﬁxed control volume enclosing a generalized turbomachine rotor. The ﬁxed coordinate system is chosen with the z-axis aligned with the axis of rotation of the machine. The idealized velocity components are shownin the ﬁgure. The ﬂuid enters the rotor at radial location, r 1, with uniform absolute velocity, ~V1; the ﬂuid leaves the rotor at radial location, r2, with uniform absolute velocity ~V2. The integrand on the right side of Eq. 10.1a is the product of with the mass ﬂow rate at each section. For uniform ﬂow into the rotor at section 1, and out of the rotor at section 2, Eq. 10.1a becomes10.2 Turbomachinery Analysis 499Tshaft^k5ðr2Vt22r1Vt1Þ_m^k ð10:1bÞ (Note that in ~r3~Vthe position vector ~ris purely radial; so only the tangential velocity component Vtcounts.) In scalar form, Tshaft5ðr2Vt22r1Vt1Þ_m ð10:1cÞ The assumptions we made in deriving this equation are steady, frictionless ﬂow; uni- form ﬂow at inlet and exit; and negligible pressure effects . Equation 10.1c is the basic relationship between torque and angular momentum for all turbomachines. It often is called the Euler turbomachine equation . Each velocity that appears in Eq. 10.1c is the tangential component of the absolute velocity of the ﬂuid crossing the control surface. The tangential velocities are chosenpositive when in the same direction as the blade speed, U. This sign convention gives T shaft.0 for pumps, fans, blowers, and compressors and Tshaft,0 for turbines. The rate of work done on a turbomachine rotor (the mechanical power, _Wm)i s given by the dot product of rotor angular velocity, ~ω, and applied torque, ~Tshaft. Using Eq. 10.1b, we obtain _Wm5~ω/C1~Tshaft5ω^k/C1Tshaft^k5ω^k/C1ðr2Vt22r1Vt1Þ_m^k or _Wm5ωTshaft5ωðr2Vt22r1Vt1Þ_m ð10:2aÞ According to Eq. 10.2a, the angular momentum of the ﬂuid is increased by the additionof shaft work. For a pump, _Wm.0 and the angular momentum of the ﬂuid must increase. For a turbine, _Wm,0 and the angular momentum of the ﬂuid must decrease. Equation 10.2a may be written in two other useful forms. Introducing U5rω, where Uis the tangential speed of the rotor at radius r, we have _Wm5ðU2Vt22U1Vt1Þ_m ð10:2bÞ Dividing Eq. 10.2b by/C1mg, we obtain a quantity with the dimensions of length, which may be viewed as the theoretical head added to the ﬂow.1 1Since _Wmhas dimensions of energy per unit time and/C1mgis weight ﬂow per unit time, head, H, is actually energy per unit weight of ﬂowing ﬂuid.X Y 12 Vn1Vn2 Vt1Vt2V2 ωω ω U1 = r1ω U2 = r2 r2r1V1 Fig. 10.6 Finite control volume and absolute velocity components for analysis of angular momentum.500 Chapter 10Fluid MachineryH5_Wm _mg51 gðU2Vt22U1Vt1Þ ð10:2cÞ Equations 10.1 and 10.2 are simpliﬁed forms of the angular-momentum equation for a control volume. They all are written for a ﬁxed control volume under the assumptions of steady, uniform ﬂow at each section. The equations show that only the difference in the product rVtorUV t, between the outlet and inlet sections, is important in deter- mining the torque applied to the rotor or the mechanical power. Although r2.r1in Fig. 10.6, no restriction has been made on geometry; the ﬂuid may enter and leave atthe same or different radii. Therefore, these equations may be used for axial, radial, or mixed-ﬂow machines. Velocity Diagrams The equations that we have derived also suggest the importance of clearly deﬁning the velocity components of the ﬂuid and rotor at the inlet and outlet sections. For thispurpose, it is useful to develop velocity diagrams (frequently called velocity polygons ) for the inlet and outlet ﬂows. Figure 10.7 shows the velocity diagrams and introducesthe notation for blade and ﬂow angles. The important notation to remember is that thevariable Vis typically used to indicate absolute velocity, that is, the velocity of the ﬂow relative to a stationary observer, while the variable Wis used to indicate ﬂow velocity relative to the rotating blade. Machines are designed such that at design condition the ﬂuid moves smoothly (without disturbances) through the blades. In the idealized situation at the design speed , ﬂow relative to the rotor is assumed to enter and leave tangent to the blade proﬁle ateach section. (This idealized inlet condition is sometimes called shockless entry ﬂow.) At speeds other than design speed (and sometimes in reality, even at design speed!),the ﬂuid may impact the blades at inlet, exit at an angle relative to the blade, or mayhave signiﬁcant ﬂow separation, leading to machine inefﬁciency. Figure 10.7 is repre- sentative of a typical radial ﬂow machine. We assume the ﬂuid is moving without major ﬂow disturbances through the machine, as shown in Fig. 10.7 a, with blade inlet and exit angles β 1and β2, respectively, relative to the circumferential direction. Note that although angles β1andβ2are both less than 90/C14in Fig. 10.7, in general they can be less than, equal to, or greater than 90/C14, and the analysis that follows applies to all of these possibilities.r2 r11β2β2β2αV2 U2 = r2ω U1 = r1ωU2W2Vn2Vt2 (a) Absolute velocity as sum of velocity relative to blade and rotor velocity(c) Velocity components at outlet (b) Velocity components at inlet1β 1αV1 U1Vn1Vt1V2 V1W1 W1W2 Fig. 10.7 Geometry and notation used to develop velocity dia- grams for typical radial-ﬂow machines.10.2 Turbomachinery Analysis 501The runner speed at inlet is U15r1ω, and therefore it is speciﬁed by the impeller geometry and the machine operating speed. The absolute ﬂuid velocity is the vector sum of the impeller velocity and the ﬂow velocity relative to the blade. The absolute inlet velocity may be determined graphically, as shown in Fig. 10.7 b. The angle of the absolute ﬂuid velocity, α1, is measured from the direction normal to the ﬂow area, as shown.2Note that for a given machine, angles α1andα2will vary with ﬂow rate, Q, (through ~V1and ~V2) and rotor speed, ω(through U1andU2). The tangential com- ponent of the absolute velocity, Vt1, and the component normal to the ﬂow area, Vn1, are also shown in Fig. 10.7 b. Note from the geometry of the ﬁgure that at each section the normal component of the absolute velocity, Vn, and the normal component of the velocity relative to the blade, Wn, are equal (because the blade has no normal velocity). To help determine the absolute velocity at the machine entrance, it is necessary to determine whether swirl exists at the entrance. Swirl, which may be present in the inlet ﬂow or introduced by inlet guide vanes , is the presence of a circumferential velocity component. When the inlet ﬂow is swirl free, the absolute inlet velocity willbe purely radial. The inlet blade angle may be speciﬁed for the design ﬂow rate andpump speed to provide a smooth entry ﬂow relative to the orientation of the blades. The velocity diagram is constructed similarly at the outlet section. The runner speed at the outlet is U 25r2ω, which again is known from the geometry and operating speed of the turbomachine. The relative ﬂow is assumed to leave the impeller tangentto the blades, as shown in Fig. 10.7 c. This idealizing assumption of perfect guidance ﬁxes the direction of the relative outlet ﬂow at design conditions. For a centrifugal pump or reaction turbine, the velocity relative to the blade generally changes in magnitude from inlet to outlet. The continuity equation must beapplied, using the impeller geometry, to determine the normal component of velocityat each section. The normal component, together with the outlet blade angle, is suf- ﬁcient to establish the velocity relative to the blade at the impeller outlet for a radial- ﬂow machine. The velocity diagram is completed by the vector addition of the velocityrelative to the blade and the wheel velocity, as shown in Fig. 10.7 c. The inlet and outlet velocity diagrams provide all the information needed to cal- culate the ideal torque or power, absorbed or delivered by the impeller, using Eqs.10.1 or 10.2. The results represent the performance of a turbomachine under idealizedconditions at the design operating point, since we have assumed: /C15Negligible torque due to surface forces (viscous and pressure). /C15Inlet and exit ﬂow tangent to blades. /C15Uniform ﬂow at inlet and exit. An actual turbomachine is not likely to conform to all of these assumptions, so the results of our analysis represent the upper limit of the performance of actualmachines. Performance of an actual machine may be estimated using the same basic approach, but accounting for variations in ﬂow properties across the blade span at theinlet and outlet sections, as well as for deviations between the blade angles andthe ﬂow directions. Such detailed calculations are beyond the scope of this book. Thealternative is to measure the overall performance of a machine on a suitable teststand. Manufacturers’ data are examples of measured performance information. In Example 10.1 we will use the Euler Turbomachine Equation to analyze an idealized centrifugal pump. 2The notation varies from book to book, so be careful when comparing references.502 Chapter 10Fluid MachineryExample 10.1 IDEALIZED CENTRIFUGAL PUMP A centrifugal pump is used to pump 150 gpm of water. The water enters the impeller axially through a 1.25-in.- diameter inlet. The inlet velocity is axial and uniform. The impeller outlet diameter is 4 in. Flow leaves the impeller at10 ft/s relative to the blades, which are radial at the exit. The impeller speed is 3450 rpm.

In practice, rotorpower and the rate of change of ﬂuid energy are not equal. Energy transfer between rotor and ﬂuid causes losses because of viscous effects, departures from uniform ﬂow, and departures of ﬂow direction from the blade angles. Kinetic energy transformation to pressure rise (which is ultimately the goal of these turbomachines) by diffusion in the ﬁxed casing introduces more losses. Energy dissipation occurs in seals and bear- ings and in ﬂuid friction between the rotor and housing of the machine (“windage”losses). Applying the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics to a control volume surrounding therotor shows that these “losses” in mechanical energy are irreversible conversions frommechanical energy to thermal energy. As was the case for the pipe ﬂows discussed inChapter 8, the thermal energy appears either as internal energy in the ﬂuid stream or as heat transfer to the surroundings. Because of these losses, in a pump the actual power delivered to the ﬂuid is less than predicted by the angular-momentum equation. In the case of a turbine, the actual power delivered to the shaft is less than the power given up by the ﬂuid stream. We can deﬁne the power, head, and efﬁciency of a turbomachine based on whether the machine does work on the ﬂuid or extracts work (or power) from the ﬂuid. For a pump, the hydraulic power is given by the rate of mechanical energy input to the ﬂuid, _Wh5ρQgH p ð10:3aÞ where Hp5p ρg1V2 2g1z ! discharge2p ρg1V2 2g1z ! suctionð10:3bÞ For a pump the head ris e measured on a test stand is less than that produced by the impeller. The rate of mechanical energy input is greater than the rate of head riseproduced by the impeller. The mechanical input power needed to drive the pump is related to the hydraulic power by deﬁning pump efﬁciency as ηp5_Wh _Wm5ρQgH p ωTð10:3cÞ To evaluate the actual change in head across a machine from Eq. 10.3b, we must know the pressure, ﬂuid velocity, and elevation at two measurement sections. Fluid velocity can be calculated from the measured volume ﬂow rate and passage diameters. (Suc- tion and discharge lines for pumps usually have different inside diameters.)and _Wm5ωTshaft53450rev min36:51 ft /C1lbf32πrad rev3min 60 s3hp/C1s 550 ft /C1lbf _Wm54:28 hp ß_WmThis problemillustrates theapplicationoftheEulerturbomachine equationforaﬁxedcontrolvolumetoacentrifugalﬂowmachine.504 Chapter 10Fluid MachineryStatic pressure usually is measured in straight sections of pipe upstream from the pump inlet and downstream from the pump outlet, after diffusion has occurred within the pump casing. The elevation of each pressure gage may be recorded, or the static pressure readings may be corrected to the same elevation. (The pump centerline provides a convenient reference level.) For a hydraulic turbine, the hydraulic power is deﬁned as the rate of mechanical energy removal from the ﬂowing ﬂuid stream, _Wh5ρQgH t ð10:4aÞ where Ht5p ρg1V2 2g1z ! inlet2p ρg1V2 2g1z ! outletð10:4bÞ For a hydraulic turbine, the power output obtained from the rotor (the mechanical power ) is less than the rate of energy transfer from the ﬂuid to the rotor, because the rotor must overcome friction and windage losses. The mechanical power output obtained from the turbine is related to the hydraulic power by deﬁning turbine efﬁciency as ηt5_Wm _Wh5ωT ρQgH tð10:4cÞ Equations 10.4a and 10.4b show that to obtain maximum power output from a hydraulic turbine, it is important to minimize the mechanical energy in the ﬂow leaving the turbine . This is accomplished by making the outlet pressure, ﬂow speed, and elevation as small as practical. The turbine must be set as close to the tailwater level as possible, allowing for the level increase when the river ﬂoods. Tests to measure tur-bine efﬁciency may be performed at various output power levels and at differentconstant head conditions (see the discussion of Figs. 10.35 and 10.36). Dimensional Analysis and Speciﬁc Speed Dimensional analysis for turbomachines was introduced in Chapter 7, where dimen-sionless ﬂow, head, and power coefﬁcients were derived in generalized form. Theindependent parameters were the ﬂow coefﬁcient and a form of Reynolds number.The dependent parameters were the head and power coefﬁcients. Our objective here is to develop the forms of dimensionless coefﬁcients in common use and to give examples illustrating their use in selecting a machine type, designingmodel tests, and scaling results. Since we developed an idealized theory for turbo-machines, we can gain additional physical insight by developing dimensionless coef-ﬁcients directly from the resulting computing equations. We will then apply theseexpressions to scaling of turbomachines through similarity rules in Section 10.3. The dimensionless ﬂow coefﬁcient ,Φ, is deﬁned by normalizing the volume ﬂow rate using the exit area and the wheel speed at the outlet. Thus Φ5Q A2U25Vn2 U2ð10:5Þ where Vn2is the velocity component perpendicular to the exit area. This component is also referred to as the meridional velocity at the wheel exit plane. It appears in true10.2 Turbomachinery Analysis 505projection in the meridional plane , which is any radial cross-section through the centerline of a machine. A dimensionless head coefﬁcient, Ψ, may be obtained by normalizing the head, H (Eq. 10.2c), with U2 2=g. Thus Ψ5gH U2 2ð10:6Þ A dimensionless torque coefﬁcient, τ, may be obtained by normalizing the torque, T(Eq. 10.1c), with ρA2U2 2R2.

As shown in Chapter 7, the ﬂow coefﬁcient, Φ, is treated as the inde- pendent parameter. Then, if viscous effects are neglected, the head, torque, and power coefﬁcients are treated as multiple dependent parameters. Under these assumptions,dynamic similarity is achieved when the ﬂow coefﬁcient is matched between modeland prototype machines. As discussed in Chapter 7, a useful parameter called speciﬁc speed can be obtained by combining the ﬂow and head coefﬁcients and eliminating the machine size. Theresult was NS5ωQ1=2 h3=4ð7:22aÞ506 Chapter 10Fluid MachineryWhen head is expressed as energy per unit mass (i.e., with dimensions equivalent to L2/t2,o rgtimes head in height of liquid), and ωis expressed in radians per second, the speciﬁc speed deﬁned by Eq. 7.22a is dimensionless. Although speciﬁc speed is a dimensionless parameter, it is common practice to use an “engineering” equation form of Eq. 7.22a in which ωandQare speciﬁed in units that are convenient but inconsistent, and energy per unit mass, h, is replaced with energy per unit weight of ﬂuid, H. When this is done, the speciﬁc speed is not a unitless parameter and the magnitude of the speciﬁc speed depends on the units usedto calculate it. Customary units used in U.S. engineering practice for pumps are rpmforω, gpm for Q, and feet (energy per unit weight) for H. In practice, the symbol Nis used to represent rate of rotation ( ω) in rpm. Thus, the dimensional speciﬁc speed for pumps, expressed in U.S. customary units, as an “engineering” equation, becomes NScu5NðrpmÞ½Qðgpm Þ/C1381=2 ½HðftÞ/C1383=4ð7:22bÞ Values of the dimensionless speciﬁc speed, NS(Eq. 7.22a), must be multiplied by 2733 to obtain the values of speciﬁc speed corresponding to this commonly used butinconsistent set of units (see Example 10.2). For hydraulic turbines, we use the fact that power output is proportional to ﬂow rate and head, 3~ρQhin consistent units. Substituting 3/ρhforQin Eq. 7.22a gives NS5ω h3=43 ρh/C18/C191=2 5ω31=2 ρ1=2h5=4ð10:13aÞ as the nondimensional form of the speciﬁc speed. In U.S. engineering practice it is customary to drop the factor ρ1=2(water is invariably the working ﬂuid in the turbines to which the speciﬁc speed is applied) andto use head Hin place of energy per unit mass h. Customary units used in U.S. engineering practice for hydraulic turbines are rpm for ω, horsepower for 3, and feet forH. In practice, the symbol Nis used to represent rate of rotation ( ω) in rpm. Thus the dimensional speciﬁc speed for a hydraulic turbine, expressed in U.S. customaryunits, as an “engineering” equation, becomes NScu5NðrpmÞ½3ðhpÞ/C1381=2 ½HðftÞ/C1385=4ð10:13bÞ Values of the dimensionless speciﬁc speed for a hydraulic turbine, NS(Eq. 10.13a), must be multiplied by 43.46 to obtain the values of speciﬁc speed corresponding to thiscommonly used but inconsistent set of units. Speciﬁc speed may be thought of as the operating speed at which a pump produces unit head at unit volume ﬂow rate (or, for a hydraulic turbine, unit power at unithead). To see this, solve for Nin Eqs. 7.22b and 10.13b, respectively.

This speciﬁc speed has been found to characterize the hydraulic design features of a machine. Low speciﬁc speeds correspond to efﬁcient operation of radial-ﬂow machines. High speciﬁc speeds correspond to efﬁcient operation of axial-ﬂow machines. For a speciﬁed head and ﬂow rate, one can choose either a low speciﬁc speed machine (whichoperates at low speed) or a high speciﬁc speed machine (which operates at higherspeed). Typical proportions for commercial pump designs and their variation with dimensionless speciﬁc speed are shown in Fig. 10.8. In this ﬁgure, the size of eachmachine has been adjusted to give the same head and ﬂow rate for rotation at a speedcorresponding to the speciﬁc speed. Thus it can be seen that if the machine’s size and weight are critical, one should choose a higher speciﬁc speed. Figure 10.8 shows the trend from radial (purely centrifugal pumps), through mixed-ﬂow, to axial-ﬂow geom-etries as speciﬁc speed increases. The corresponding efﬁciency trends for typical pumps are shown in Fig. 10.9, which shows that pump capacity generally increases as speciﬁc speed increases. The ﬁgurealso shows that at any given speciﬁc speed, efﬁciency is higher for large pumps thanfor small ones. Physically this scale effect means that viscous losses become lessimportant as the pump size is increased. Characteristic proportions of hydraulic turbines also are correlated by speciﬁc speed, as shown in Fig. 10.10. As in Fig. 10.8, the machine size has been scaled in thisillustration to deliver approximately the same power at unit head when rotating at aspeed equal to the speciﬁc speed. The corresponding efﬁciency trends for typicalturbine types are shown in Fig. 10.11. Several variations of speciﬁc speed, calculated directly from engineering units, are widely used in practice.

If the ﬂuid enters the impeller with a purely radial absolute velocity, then the ﬂuid entering the impeller has noangular momentum and V t1is identically zero. With Vt150, the increase in head (from Eq. 10.2c) is given by H5U2Vt2 gð10:14Þ From the exit velocity diagram of Fig. 10.7 c, Vt25U22W2cosβ25U22Vn2 sinβ2cosβ25U22Vn2cotβ2 ð10:15Þ Then H5U2 22U2Vn2cotβ2 gð10:16Þ For an impeller of width w, the volume ﬂow rate is Q5πD2wVn2ð10:17Þ To express the increase in head in terms of volume ﬂow rate, we substitute for Vn2in terms of Qfrom Eq. 10.17. Thus H5U2 2 g2U2cotβ2 πD2wgQ ð10:18aÞ Equation 10.18a is of the form H5C12C2Q ð10:18bÞ where constants C1andC2are functions of machine geometry andspeed , C15U2 2 gand C25U2cotβ2 πD2wg Thus Eq. 10.18a predicts a linear variation of head, H, with volume ﬂow rate, Q. Note that this linear relation is an idealized model; actual devices may have only anapproximate linear variation and may be better modeled with a curve-ﬁtting methodbased on measured data. (We will see an example of this in Example 10.5.) Constant C 15U2 2=grepresents the ideal head developed by the pump for zero ﬂow rate; this is called the shutoff head . The slope of the curve of head versus ﬂow rate (the H/C0Qcurve) depends on the sign and magnitude of C2. For radial outlet vanes, β2590/C14and C250. The tangential component of the absolute velocity at the outlet is equal to the wheel speed and is independent of ﬂow rate. From Eq. 10.18a, the ideal head is independent of ﬂow rate. This characteristic H/C0Qcurve is plotted in Fig. 10.12. If the vanes are backward curved (as shown in Fig. 10.7 a),β2,90/C14andC2.0. Then the tangential component of the absolute outlet velocity is less than the wheel speed andit decreases in proportion to the ﬂow rate. From Eq. 10.18a, the ideal head decreaseslinearly with increasing ﬂow rate. The corresponding H/C0Qcurve is plotted in Fig. 10.12. If the vanes are forward curved, then β 2.90/C14andC2,0. The tangential compo- nent of the absolute ﬂuid velocity at the outlet is greater than the wheel speed, and it increases as the ﬂow rate increases. From Eq. l0.7a, the ideal head increases linearly with increasing ﬂow rate. The corresponding H/C0Qcurve is plotted in Fig. 10.12. The characteristics of a radial-ﬂow machine can be altered by changing the outlet vane angle; the idealized model developed above predicts the trends as the outlet vaneangle is changed.10.3 Pumps, Fans, and Blowers 511The predictions of the idealized angular-momentum theory for a centrifugal pump are summarized in Fig. 10.12. Forward-curved vanes are almost never used in practice because they tend to have an unstable operating point. Application of the Euler Equation to Axial Flow Pumps and Fans The Euler Turbomachine Equation developed in Section 10.2 can be used for axial-ﬂow machines as well. However, in order to use this model, some assumptions need to be made. The most important assumption is that the ﬂow properties at the mean radius (the midpoint of the rotor blades) fully represent the ﬂow at all radii. This is a goodassumption, provided the ratio of blade height to mean radius is approximately 0.2 orless [7]. At larger ratios a three-dimensional analysis will be necessary. Such an analysisis beyond the scope of this work, but other sources can provide information on thisphenomenon, such as Dixon [7]. A second assumption is that there is no radial com-ponent to the ﬂow velocity. This is a reasonable assumption, since many axial machinesincorporate stators or sets of vanes which guide the ﬂow into the machine, removing unwanted radial velocity components. The third assumption is that the ﬂow only varies in the axial direction. This is not the same as saying that there is only an axial component of velocity! In fact, there will be a signiﬁcant component of the velocity in the tangential direction as the ﬂow passes through an axial-ﬂow machine, i.e., the ﬂow will have “swirl.”The meaning of this assumption is that at a given axial location, the amount of swirl inthe ﬂow is constant, rather than varying between the blades of the machine [7]. The primary consequence of this model applied to axial-ﬂow machines is that the radius used in Equations (10.1) is constant, i.e., r 15r25Rm ð10:19aÞ Since the angular velocity ωof the rotor is also constant, it follows that U15U25U ð10:19bÞCross sectionMeridional section Volume flow rate, QHead, H R22βββ ωωω U2 =R2W2 (rel) V2 (abs) H = –––––R22 2 gBackward-curved, 2 < 90°βForward-curved, 2 > 90° Radial, 2 = 90° Fig. 10.12 Idealized relationship between head and volume ﬂow rate for centrifugal pump with forward-curved, radial, andbackward-curved impeller blades.512 Chapter 10Fluid MachineryTherefore, Equations (10.1) and (10.2) reduce to: Tshaft5RmðVt22Vt1Þ_m ð10:20Þ _Wm5UðVt22Vt1Þ_m ð10:21Þ H5_Wm _mg5U gðVt22Vt1Þ ð10:22Þ In Example 10.3 these special versions of the Euler turbomachine equation and veloc ity diagrams are utilized in the analysis of ﬂow through an axial-ﬂow fan. Example 10.3 IDEALIZED AXIAL-FLOW FAN An axial-ﬂow fan operates at 1200 rpm. The blade tip diameter is 1.1 m and the hub diameter is 0.8 m. The inlet and exit angles at the mean blade radius are 30/C14and 60/C14, respectively. Inlet guide vanes give the absolute ﬂow entering the ﬁrst stage an angle of 30/C14. The ﬂuid is air at standard conditions and the ﬂow may be considered incompressible. There is no change in axial component of velocity across the rotor. Assume the relative ﬂow enters and leaves therotor at the geometric blade angles and use properties at the mean blade radius for calculations. For these idealizedconditions, draw the inlet velocity diagram, determine the volume ﬂow rate of the fan, and sketch the rotor bladeshapes. Using the data so obtained, draw the outlet velocity diagram and calculate the minimum torque and powerneeded to drive the fan. Given: Flow through rotor of axial-ﬂow fan.

For a given machine, each of these characteristics is a function of ﬂow rate; the characteristics forsimilar machines depend on size and operating speed. Here we deﬁne performance characteristics for pumps and turbines and review experimentally measured trends for typical machines. The idealized analyses presented in Section 10.2 are useful to predict trends and to approximate the design-point performance of an energy-absorbing or an energy-producing machine. However, the complete performance of a real machine, including operation at off-design conditions, must be determined experimentally. To determine performance, a pump, fan, blower, or compressor must be set up on an instrumented test stand with the capability of measuring ﬂow rate, speed, input torque, and pressure rise. The test must be performed according to a standardizedprocedure corresponding to the machine being tested [8, 9]. Measurements are madeas ﬂow rate is varied from shutoff (zero ﬂow) to maximum delivery by varying theload from maximum to minimum (by starting with a valve that is closed and opening itto fully open in stages). Power input to the machine is determined from a calibrated motor or calculated from measured speed and torque, and then efﬁciency is computed as illustrated in Example 10.4. Finally, the calculated characteristics are plotted in thedesired engineering units or nondimensionally. If appropriate, smooth curves may befaired through the plotted points or curve-ﬁts may be made to the results, as illus-trated in Example 10.5.

Given: Pump test data and performance calculated in Example 10.4.518 Chapter 10Fluid MachineryThe basic procedure used to calculate machine performance was illustrated for a centrifugal pump in Example 10.4. The difference in static pressures between the pump suction and discharge was used to calculate the head rise produced by thepump.

Figure 10.13 shows that the head at any ﬂow rate in the real machine may be sig- niﬁcantly lower than is predicted by the idealized analysis. Some of the causes are: 1.At very low ﬂow rate, some ﬂuid recirculates in the impeller. 2.Friction loss and leakage loss both increase with ﬂow rate. 3.“Shock loss” results from a mismatch between the direction of the relative velocityan d the tangent to the impeller blade at the inlet.4 Curves such as those in Figs. 7.5 and 10.13 are measured at constant (design) speed with a single impeller diameter. It is common practice to vary pump capacity bychanging the impeller size in a given casing. To present information compactly, datafrom tests of several impeller diameters may be plotted on a single graph, as shown inFig. 10.14. As before, for each diameter, head is plotted versus ﬂow rate; each curve is labeled with the corresponding diameter. Efﬁciency contours are plotted by joining points having the same constant efﬁciency. Power-requirement contours are alsoplotted. Finally, the NPSH requirements (which we have not yet deﬁned; we will discuss its meaning later in this section) are shown for the extreme diameters; in Fig.10.14, the curve for the 8-in. impeller lies between the curves for the 6-in. and 10-in.impellers. With the advent of computer-aided analyses, the data of Fig. 10.14 are often tabulated for quick access by computer codes. Therefore, data are not always pre- sented in the manner shown in this ﬁgure. Speciﬁcally, the data of Fig. 10.14 are simpliﬁed by reporting an average efﬁciency as a function of the ﬂow rate only, asshown in Fig. 10.15, rather than as a function of ﬂow rate and head. The ﬁgures inAppendix D display pump performance in this format. For this typical machine, head is a maximum at shutoff and decreases con- tinuously as ﬂow rate increases. Input power is minimum at shutoff and increases as Loss due to recirculation Ideal head-flow curve (Fig. 10.12) Loss due to flow friction Actual head-flow curve Approximate best efficiency point "Shock" loss Volume flow rate, QHead, H Fig. 10.13 Comparison of ideal and actual head-ﬂow curves for a centrifugal pump with backward-curved impeller blades [10]. 3The only important pump characteristic not shown in Fig. 7.5 is the net positive suction head (NPSH) required to prevent cavitation. Cavitation and NPSH will be treated later in this section. 4This loss is largest at high and low ﬂow rates; it decreases essentially to zero as optimum operating con- ditions are approached [11].520 Chapter 10Fluid Machinerydelivery is increased. Consequently, to minimize the starting load, it may be advisable to start the pump with the outlet valve closed. (However, the valve should not be leftclosed for long, lest the pump overheat as energy dissipated by friction is transferred tothe water in the housing.) Pump efﬁciency increases with capacity until the best efﬁ- ciency point (BEP) is reached, then decreases as ﬂow rate is increased further. For minimum energy consumption, it is desirable to operate as close to BEP as possible. Centrifugal pumps may be combined in parallel to deliver greater ﬂow or in series to deliver greater head. A number of manufacturers build multistage pumps, whichare essentially several pumps arranged in series within a single casing. Pumps andblowers are usually tested at several constant speeds. Common practice is to drivemachines with electric motors at nearly constant speed, but in some system applica-tions impressive energy savings can result from variable-speed operation. These pumpapplication topics are discussed later in this section.Impeller diameter 10 in. 8 in. 6 in.

Frequently, casings of different sizes are developed from a common design by increasing or decreasing all dimensions by the same scale ratio. Additional variation in character-istic curves may be obtained by varying the operating speed or by changing theimpeller size within a given pump housing. The dimensionless parameters developedin Chapter 7 form the basis for predicting changes in performance that result fromchanges in pump size, operating speed, or impeller diameter. To achieve dynamic similarity requires geometric and kinematic similarity. Assuming similar pumps and ﬂow ﬁelds and neglecting viscous effects, as shown in Chapter 7, we obtain dynamic similarity when the dimensionless ﬂow coefﬁcient is held constant. Dynamically similar operation is assured when two ﬂow conditions satisfy the relation Q1 ω1D3 15Q2 ω2D3 2ð10:23aÞ The dimensionless head and power coefﬁcients depend only on the ﬂow coefﬁcient, i.e., h ω2D25f1/C18Q ωD3/C19 and3 ρω3D55f2/C18Q ωD3/C19 Hence, when we have dynamic similarity, as shown in Example 7.6, pump char- acteristics at a new condition (subscript 2) may be related to those at an old condition (subscript 1) by h1 ω2 1D215h2 ω2 2D22ð10:23bÞ and 31 ρω3 1D51532 ρω3 2D52ð10:23cÞ These scaling relationships may be used to predict the effects of changes in pump ope rating speed, pump size, or impeller diameter within a given housing. The simplest situation is when we keep the same pump and only the pump speed is changed. Then geometric similarity is assured. Kinematic similarity holds if there is nocavitation; ﬂows are then dynamically similar when the ﬂow coefﬁcients are matched.For this case of speed change with ﬁxed diameter, Eqs. 10.23 become Q2 Q15ω2 ω1ð10:24aÞ h2 h15H2 H15ω2 ω1/C18/C192 ð10:24bÞ 32 315ω2 ω1/C18/C193 ð10:24cÞ In Example 10.5, we showed that a pump performance curve may be modeled withi n engineering accuracy by the parabolic relationship, H5H02AQ2ð10:25aÞ Since this representation contains two parameters, the pump curve for the new ope rating condition could be derived by scaling any two points from the performance curve measured at the original operating condition. Usually, the shutoff condition and522 Chapter 10Fluid Machinerythebest efﬁciency point are chosen for scaling. These points are represented by points BandCin Fig. 10.16. As shown by Eq. 10.24a, the ﬂow rate increases by the ratio of operating speeds, so QBu5ω2 ω1QB50 and QCu5ω2 ω1QC Thus, point Buis located directly above point B, and point Cumoves to the right of point C(in this example ω2.ω1). The head increases by the square of the speed ratio, so HBu5HBω1 ω2/C18/C192 and HCu5HCω2 ω1/C18/C192 Points CandCu, where dynamically similar ﬂow conditions are present, are termed homologous points for the pump. We can relate the old operating condition (e.g., running at speed N151170 rpm, as shown in Fig. 10.16) to the new, primed one (e.g., running at speed N251750 rpm in Fig. 10.16) using the parabolic relation and Eqs. 10.24a and 10.24b, H5H uω1 ω2/C18/C192 5H02AQ25H u0ω1 ω2/C18/C192 2AQ u2ω1 ω2/C18/C192 or H u5H u02AQ u2ð10:25bÞ so that for a given pump the factor Aremains unchanged as we change pump speed (as we will verify in Example 10.6). Efﬁciency remains relatively constant between dynamically similar operating points when only the pump operating speed is changed. Application of these ideas is illustrated in Example 10.6.B' B1750 rpm 1170 rpmCC' 500 400 300 200 Volume flow rate, Q (gpm)100 00204060Head, H (ft) Fig. 10.16 Schematic of a pump performance curve, illustrating the effect of a change in pump operating speed. Example 10.6 SCALING PUMP PERFORMANCE CURVES When operated at N51170 rpm, a centrifugal pump, with impeller diameter D58 in., has shutoff head H0525.0 ft of water. At the same operating speed, best efﬁciency occurs at Q5300 gpm, where the head is H521.9 ft of water. Fit these data at 1170 rpm with a parabola. Scale the results to a new operating speed of 1750 rpm. Plot and compare the results.

Assuming no cavitation occurs, thetwo ﬂows also will be kinematically similar. Then dynamic similarity will be obtained when the two ﬂow coefﬁcientsare matched. Denoting the 1170 rpm condition by subscript 1 and the 1750 rpm condition by subscript 2, we have Q2 ω2D3 25Q1 ω1D3 1orQ2 Q15ω2 ω15N2 N1 since D25D1.

The ﬂow, head, and power would be predicted to vary with pump size as Q25Q1D2 D1/C18/C193 ;H25H1D2 D1/C18/C192 ;and32531D2 D1/C18/C195 ð10:26Þ It is impractical to manufacture and test a series of pump models that differ in size by only a scale ratio. Instead it is common practice to test a given pump casing at a ﬁxed speed with several impellers of different diameter [13]. Because pump casing width isthe same for each test, impeller width also must be the same; only impeller diameter D is changed. As a result, volume ﬂow rate scales in proportion to D 2, not to D3. Pump input power at ﬁxed speed scales as the product of ﬂow rate and head, so it becomesproportional to D Using this modiﬁed scaling method frequently gives results of acceptable accuracy, as demonstrated in several end-of-chapter problems where themethod is checked against measured performance data from Appendix D. It is not possible to compare the efﬁciencies at the two operating conditions directly. However, viscous effects should become relatively less important as thepump size increases. Thus efﬁciency should improve slightly as diameter is increased. Moody [14] suggested an empirical equation that may be used to estimate the max- imum efﬁciency of a prototype pump based on test data from a geometrically similarmodel of the prototype pump. His equation is written 12ηp 12ηm5Dm Dp/C18/C191=5 ð10:27Þ To develop Eq. 10.27, Moody assumed that only the surface resistance changes withmodel scale so that losses in passages of the same roughness vary as 1/ D5.

Further, the Moody model does not account for any difference in mechanical losses between model and prototype, nor does it allow determination ofoff-peak efﬁciencies. Nevertheless, scaling of the maximum-efﬁciency point is useful to obtain a general estimate of the efﬁciency curve for the prototype pump. Cavitation and Net Positive Suction Head Cavitation can occur in any machine handling liquid whenever the local static pres- sure falls below the vapor pressure of the liquid. When this occurs, the liquid can locally ﬂash to vapor, forming a vapor cavity and signiﬁcantly changing the ﬂow pattern from the noncavitating condition. The vapor cavity changes the effective shape of the ﬂow passage, thus altering the local pressure ﬁeld. Since the sizeand shape of the vapor cavity are inﬂuenced by the local pressure ﬁeld, the ﬂow maybecome unsteady. The unsteadiness may cause the entire ﬂow to oscillate and themachine to vibrate. As cavitation commences, it reduces the performance of a pump or turbine rapidly. Thus cavitation must be avoided to maintain stable and efﬁcient operation. In addi-tion, local surface pressures may become high when the vapor cavity implodes or collapses, causing erosion damage or surface pitting. The damage may be severe enough to destroy a machine made from a brittle, low-strength material. Obviouslycavitation also must be avoided to assure long machine life. In a pump, cavitation tends to begin at the section where the ﬂow is accelerated into the impeller. Cavitation in a turbine begins where pressure is lowest. The ten-dency to cavitate increases as local ﬂow speeds increase; this occurs whenever ﬂowrate or machine operating speed is increased. Cavitation can be avoided if the pressure everywhere in the machine is kept above the vapor pressure of the operating liquid. At constant speed, this requires that apressure somewhat greater than the vapor pressure of the liquid be maintained ata pump inlet (the suction ). Because of pressure losses in the inlet piping, the suction pressure may be subatmospheric. Therefore it is important to carefully limitthe pressure drop in the inlet piping system. Net positive suction head (NPSH ) is deﬁned as the difference between the absolute stagnation pressure in the ﬂow at the pump suction and the liquid vapor pressure,expressed as head of ﬂowing liquid [15]. 5Hence the NPSH is a measure of the dif- ference between the maximum possible pressure in the given ﬂow and the pressure atwhich the liquid will start ﬂashing over to a vapor; the larger the NPSH , the less likely cavitation is to occur. The net positive suction head required (NPSHR ) by a speciﬁc pump to suppress cavitation varies with the liquid pumped, and with the liquid tem-perature and pump condition (e.g., as critical geometric features of the pump areaffected by wear). NPSHR may be measured in a pump test facility by controlling the input pressure. The results are plotted on the pump performance curve. Typical pumpcharacteristic curves for three impellers tested in the same housing were shown in Fig. 10.14. Experimentally determined NPSHR curves for the largest and smallest impeller diameters are plotted near the bottom of the ﬁgure. Thenet positive suction head available (NPSHA ) at the pump inlet must be greater than the NPSHR to suppress cavitation. Pressure drop in the inlet piping and pump entrance increases as volume ﬂow rate increases. Thus for any system, the NPSHA decreases as ﬂow rate is raised. The NPSHR of the pump increases as the ﬂow rate is raised. Therefore, as the system ﬂow rate is increased, the curves for NPSHA and NPSHR versus ﬂow rate ultimately cross. Hence, for any inlet system, there is a ﬂow CLASSIC VIDEO Cavitation . 5NPSH may be expressed in any convenient units of measure, such as height of the ﬂowing liquid, e.g., feet of water (hence the term suction head ), psia, or kPa (abs). When expressed as head,NPSH is measured relative to the pump impeller centerline.526 Chapter 10Fluid Machineryrate that cannot be exceeded if ﬂow through the pump is to remain free from cavi- tation. Inlet pressure losses may be reduced by increasing the diameter of the inletpiping; for this reason, many centrifugal pumps have larger ﬂanges or couplings at the inlet than at the outlet. Example 10.7 CALCULATION OF NET POSITIVE SUCTION HEAD ( NPSH ) A Peerless Type 4AE11 centrifugal pump (Fig. D.3, Appendix D) is tested at 1750 rpm using a ﬂow system with the layout of Example 10.4. The water level in the inlet reservoir is 3.5 ft above the pump centerline; the inlet line consists of 6 ft of 5 in. diameter straight cast-iron pipe, a standard elbow, and a fully open gate valve. Calculate the net positive suction head available ( NPSHA ) at the pump inlet at a volume ﬂow rate of 1000 gpm of water at 80/C14F. Compare with the net positive suction head required ( NPSHR ) by the pump at this ﬂow rate. Plot NPSHA and NPSHR for water at 80/C14F and 180/C14F versus volume ﬂow rate. Given: A Peerless Type 4AE11 centrifugal pump (Fig. D.3, Appendix D) is tested at 1750 rpm using a ﬂow system with the layout of Example 10.4.

Solution: Net positive suction head ( NPSH ) is deﬁned as the difference between the absolute stagnation pressure in the ﬂow at the pump suction and the liquid vapor pressure, expressed as head of ﬂowing liquid. Therefore it is necessary tocalculate the head at the pump suction. Apply the energy equation for steady, incompressible pipe ﬂow to compute the pressure at the pump inlet and thus the NPSHA . Denote the reservoir level as 1and the pump suction as s, as shown above.

The engineering application of ﬂuid machines in an actual system requires matching the machine and system characteristics, while satis-fying constraints of energy efﬁciency, capital economy, and durability. We havealluded to the vast assortment of hardware offered by competing suppliers; thisvariety veriﬁes the commercial importance of ﬂuid machinery in modern engineeringsystems. Usually it is more economical to specify a production machine rather than a custom unit, because products of established vendors have known, published performance characteristics, and they must be durable to survive in the marketplace. Application engineering consists of making the best selection from catalogs of available products.In addition to machine characteristic curves, all manufacturers provide a wealth ofdimensional data, alternative conﬁguration and mounting schemes, and technicalinformation bulletins to guide intelligent application of their products. This section consists of a brief review of relevant theory, followed by example applications using data taken from manufacturer literature.

These may be studied as typical examples of performance data supplied by manufacturers. Thecurves may also be used to help solve the equipment selection and system designproblems at the end of the chapter. We will consider various machines for doing work on a ﬂuid, but we ﬁrst make a few general points. As we saw in Example 10.4, a typical pump, for example,produces a smaller head as the ﬂow rate is increased. On the other hand, the head (which includes major and minor losses) required to maintain ﬂow in a pipe system increases with the ﬂow rate. H ence, as shown graphically 6in Fig. 10.17, a pump- system will run at the operating point , the ﬂow rate at which the pump head rise and required system head match. (Figure 10.17 also shows a pump efﬁciency curve,indicating that, for optimum pump sel ection, a pump should be chosen that has maximum efﬁciency at the operating point ﬂow rate.) The pump-system shown inFig. 10.17 is stable. If for some reason the ﬂow rate falls below the operating ﬂowrate, the pump pressure head rises above the required system head, and so the ﬂow rate increases back to the operating point . Conversely, if the ﬂow rate momentarily increases, the required head exceeds the head provided by the pump, and the ﬂow rate decreases back to the operating point. This notion of an operating point appliesto each machine we will consider (although, as we will see, the operating points arenot always stable). The system pressure requirement at a given ﬂow rate is composed of frictional pressure drop (major loss due to friction in straight sections of constant area andminor loss due to entrances, ﬁttings, valves, and exits) and pressure changes due to gravity (static lift may be positive or negative). It is useful to discuss the two limiting cases of pure friction and pure lift before considering their combination. Theall-friction system head versus ﬂow curve, with no static lift, starts at zero ﬂow and head, as shown in Fig. 10.18 a. For this system the total head required is the sum of major and minor losses, h lT5X hl1X hlm5X fL DV2 21X fLe DV2 21KV2 2 ! For turbulent ﬂow (the usual ﬂow regime in engineering systems), as we learned inChapter 8 (see Fig. 8.13), the friction factors approach constant and the minor losscoefﬁcients Kand equivalent lengths L eare also constant. Hence hlTBV2BQ2so that the system curve is approximately parabolic.

To develop the friction curve, losses are computed at various ﬂow rates and then plotted. Pressure change due to elevation difference is independent of ﬂow rate. Thus the pure lift system head-ﬂow curve is a horizontal straight line. The gravity head is evaluated from the change in elevation in the system. All actual ﬂow systems have some frictional pressure drop and some elevation change. Thus all system head-ﬂow curves may be treated as the sum of a frictional component and a static-lift component. The head for the complete system at any ﬂowrate is the sum of the frictional and lift heads. The system head-ﬂow curve is plotted in Fig. 10.18 b. Whether the resulting system curve is steep orﬂatdepends on the relative importance of friction and gravity. Friction drop may be relatively unimportant in the water supply to a high-rise building (e.g., the Willis Tower, formerly the Sears Tower, in Chicago,which is nearly 400 m tall), and gravity lift may be negligible in an air-handling systemfor a one-story building.

Note that these equations may also be used to analyze a ﬂuid machine with internal losses as well. The pump operating point is deﬁned by superimposing the system curve and the pump performance curve, as shown in Fig. 10.17. The point of intersection is the only condition where the pump and system ﬂow rates are equal and the pump and systemheads are equal simultaneously. The procedure used to determine the match point fora pumping system is illustrated in Example 10.8.

We can obtain more accuracy from the graphical solution using the following approach: Because the Reynolds number corresponds to the fully turbulent regime, f/C25const., we can simplify the equation for the head loss and write it in the formPump 36 ft System750 gpm 1000 800 600 Volume flow rate, Q (gpm)400 200 00204060Head, H (ft of water)10.3 Pumps, Fans, and Blowers 533The shapes of both the pump curve and the system curve can be important to system stability in certain applications. The pump curve shown in Fig. 10.17 is typical of the curve for a new centrifugal pump of intermediate speciﬁc speed, for which thehead decreases smoothly and monotonically as the ﬂow rate increases from shutoff.Two effects take place gradually as the system ages: (1) The pump wears, and itsperformance decreases (it produces less pressure head; so the pump curve graduallymoves downward toward lower head at each ﬂow rate). (2) The system head increases(the system curve gradually moves toward higher head at each ﬂow rate because ofHlT/C25CQ2ð3Þ where C58=π2D4 2gtimes the term in square brackets in the expression for HlT. We can obtain a value for Cdirectly from Eq. 3 by using values for HlTandQfrom the table at a point close to the anticipated operating point. For example, from the Q5700 gpm data point, C5HlT Q2530:6f t 7002ðgpm Þ256:2431025ft=ðgpm Þ2 Hence, the approximate analytical expression for the system head curve is HlT56:2431025ft=ðgpm Þ2½Qðgpm Þ/C1382 ßHlT Using Eqs. 2 and 3 in Eq. 1, we obtain H02AQ25CQ2 Solving for Q, the volume ﬂow rate at the operating point, gives Q5H0 A1C/C20/C211=2 For this case, Q555:9f t3ðgpm Þ2 ð3:443102516:2431025Þft"#1=2 5760 gpm ßQ The volume ﬂow rate may be substituted into either expression for head to calculate the head at the operating point as H5CQ256:2431025ft ðgpm Þ23ð760Þ2ðgpm Þ2536:0f t ßH We can see that in this problem our reading of the operating point from the graph was pretty good: The reading of head was in agree-ment with the calculated head; the reading of ﬂow rate was less than2 percent different from the calculated result. Note that both sets of results are approximate. We can get a more accurate, and easier, result by using Excel’s Solver orGoal Seek to ﬁnd the operating point, allowing for the fact that the friction factors vary, however slightly, with Reynolds number. Doing so yields an operating point ﬂow rate of 761 gpm and head of 36.0 ft.This problemillustrates theproceduresusedtoﬁnd theoperatingpointofapumpand ﬂow system.üTheapproximatemethods—graphi-cal,and assumingfrictionlossesareproportionaltoQ2—yieldedresultsclosetothedetailed computationusingExce l.Weconc ludethat sincemostpipe ﬂow frictioncoefﬁcientsareaccuratetoonlyabou t610percentanyway,theapproximate methods areaccurateenough.Ontheotherhand,useofExcel,whenavailable,iseasieraswell asbeingmoreaccurate.üEquation3,forthehead lossinthesystem,mustbereplaced withanequationoftheformH5Z01CQ2whentheheadHrequiredbythesystemhasacomponentZ0due togravityaswell asacomponentduetoheadlosses.

The effect of these changes is to move the operating point toward lower ﬂow rates over time. The magnitude of the change in ﬂow rate depends on the shapes of the pump and system curves. The capacity losses, as pump wear occurs, are compared for steep (friction domi- nated) and ﬂat (gravity dominated) system curves in Fig. 10.19. The loss in capacity isgreater for the ﬂat system curve than for the steep system curve. The pump efﬁciency curve is also plotted in Fig. 10.17. The original system operating point usually is chosen to coincide with the maximum efﬁciency by careful choice ofpump size and operating speed. Pump wear increases internal leakage, thus reducingdelivery and lowering peak efﬁciency. In addition, as shown in Fig. 10.19, the operatingpoint moves toward lower ﬂow rate, away from the best efﬁciency point. Thus the reduced system performance may not be accompanied by reduced energy usage. Sometimes it is necessary to satisfy a high-head, low-ﬂow requirement; this forces selection of a pump with low speciﬁc speed. Such a pump may have a performance curve with a slightly rising head near shutoff, as shown in Fig. 10.20. When the system curve issteep, the operating point is well-deﬁned and no problems with system operation shouldresult. However, use of the pump with a ﬂat system curve could easily cause problems,especially if the actual system curve were slightly above the computed curve or thepump delivery were below the charted head capacity performance. If there are two points of intersection of the pump and system curves, the system may operate at either point, depending on conditions at start-up; a disturbance couldcause the system operating point to shift to the second point of intersection. Undercertain conditions, the system operating point can alternate between the two points ofintersection, causing unsteady ﬂow and unsatisfactory performance.

Steep system curve Flat system curve Pump head-capacity curve Pump efficiency curve Volume flow rateHead Fig. 10.20 Operation of low speciﬁc speed pump near shutoff. 7As the pipe ages, mineral deposits form on the wall (see Fig. 8.14), raising the relative roughness and reducing the pipe diameter compared with the as-new condition. See Problem 10.63 for typical friction factor data.10.3 Pumps, Fans, and Blowers 535Instead of a single pump of low speciﬁc speed, a multistage pump may be used in this situation. Since the ﬂow rate through all stages is the same, but the head per stage is less than in the single-stage unit, the speciﬁc speed of the multistage pump is higher(see Eq. 7.22a). The head-ﬂow characteristic curve of some high speciﬁc speed pumps shows a dip at capacities below the peak efﬁciency point, as shown in Fig. 10.21. Caution is neededin applying such pumps if it is ever necessary to operate the pump at or near the dip inthe head-ﬂow curve. No trouble should occur if the system characteristic is steep, forthere will be only one point of intersection with the pump curve. Unless this inter-section is near point B, the system should return to stable, steady-state operation following any transient disturbance. Operation with a ﬂat system curve is more problematic. It is possible to have one, two, or three points of intersection of the pump and system curves, as suggested in theﬁgure. Points AandCare stable operating points, but point Bis unstable: If the ﬂow rate momentarily falls below Q B, for whatever reason, the ﬂow rate will continue to fall (to QA) because the head provided by the pump is now less than that required by the system; conversely, if the ﬂow surges above QB, the ﬂow rate will continue to increase (to QC) because the pump head exceeds the required head. With the ﬂat system curve, the pump may “hunt” or oscillate periodically or aperiodically. Several other factors can adversely inﬂuence pump performance: pumping hot liquid, pumping liquid with entrained vapor, and pumping liquid with high viscosity.According to [9], the presence of small amounts of entrained gas can drasticallyreduce performance. As little as 4 percent vapor can reduce pump capacity by morethan 40 percent. Air can enter the suction side of the pumping circuit where pressureis below atmospheric if any leaks are present. Adequate submergence of the suction pipe is necessary to prevent air entrainment. Insufﬁcient submergence can cause a vortex to form at the pipe inlet. If the vortex isstrong, air can enter the suction pipe. Dickinson [16] and Hicks and Edwards [17] give guidelines for adequate suction-basin design to eliminate the likelihood of vortex formation. Increased ﬂuid viscosity may dramatically reduce the performance of a centrifugal pump [17]. Typical experimental test results are plotted in Fig. 10.22. In theﬁgure, pump performance with water ( μ51 cP) is compared with performance in pumping a more viscous liquid ( μ5220 cP). The increased viscosity reduces the head produced by the pump. At the same time the input power requirement is increased.The result is a dramatic drop in pump efﬁciency at all ﬂow rates. Heating a liquid raises its vapor pressure. Thus to pump a hot liquid requires additional pressure at the pump inlet to prevent cavitation, as we saw in Example 10.7. In some systems, such as city water supply or chilled-water circulation, there may be a wide range in demand with a relatively constant system resistance. In these cases,it may be possible to operate constant-speed pumps in series or parallel to supply thesystem requirements without excessive energy dissipation due to outlet throttling.Pump efficiency curvePump head-capacity curveFlat system curveSteep system curve Volume flow rateHeadABC Fig. 10.21 Operation of high speciﬁc speed pump near the dip.536 Chapter 10Fluid MachineryTwo or more pumps may be operated in parallel or series to supply ﬂow at high demand conditions, and fewer units can be used when demand is low. For pumps in series , the combined performance curve is derived by adding the head rises at each ﬂow rate (Fig. 10.23). The increase in ﬂow rate gained by operating pumps in series depends on the resistance of the system being supplied. For two pumps in series, delivery will increase at any system head. The characteristiccurves for one pump and for two identical pumps in series are H 15H02AQ2 and H2s52ðH02AQ2Þ52H022AQ2 Figure 10.23 is a schematic illustrating the application of two identical pumps in series. A reasonable match to the system requirement is possible—while keepingefﬁciency high—if the system curve is relatively steep. In an actual system, it is not appropriate simply to connect two pumps in series. If only one pump were powered, ﬂow through the second, unpowered pump would causeadditional losses, raising the system resistance. It also is desirable to arrange the pumps and piping so that each pump can be taken out of the pumping circuit for maintenance, repair, or replacement when needed. Thus a system of bypasses, valves,and check valves may be necessary in an actual installation [13, 17].Head curve Efficiency curve QAHA (a) Single-pump operationQAHAHA (b) Two pumps in series Fig. 10.23 Operation of two centrifugal pumps in series.EfficiencyHeadPower Water Viscous liquid ( = 220 cP, SG = 0.9)μ 100001020304050607080900102030 800 600 Volume flow rate (gpm)400 200 0020406080100120 Power (hp) Efficiency (%)Head (ft) Fig. 10.22 Effect of liquid viscosity on performance of a centrifugal pump [9].10.3 Pumps, Fans, and Blowers 537Pumps also may be combined in parallel. The resulting performance curve, shown in Fig. 10.24, is obtained by adding the pump capacities at each head. The char- acteristic curves for one pump and for two identical pumps in parallel are H15H02AQ2 and H2p5H02AQ 2/C18/C192 5H021 4AQ2 The schematic in Fig. 10.24 shows that the parallel combination may be used most effectively to increase system capacity when the system curve is relatively ﬂat. An actual system installation with parallel pumps also requires more thought to allow satisfactory operation with only one pump powered. It is necessary to prevent backﬂow through the pump that is not powered. To prevent backﬂow and to permit pump removal, a more complex and expensive piping setup is needed. Many other piping arrangements and pump combinations are possible. Pumps of different sizes, heads, and capacities may be combined in series, parallel, or series-parallel arrangements. Obviously the complexity of the piping and control systemincreases rapidly. In many applications the complexity is due to a requirement that thesystem handle a variety of ﬂow rates—a range of ﬂow rates can be generated by usingpumps in parallel and in series and by using throttling valves. Throttling valves are usually necessary because constant-speed motors drive most pumps, so simply using a network of pumps (with some on and others off) without throttling valves allows theﬂow rate to be varied only in discrete steps. The disadvantage of throttling valves isthat they can be a major loss of energy so that a given ﬂow rate will require a largerpower supply than would otherwise be the case. Some typical data for a throttlingvalve, given in Table 10.1 [18], show a decreasing valve efﬁciency (the percentage ofpump pressure available that is not consumed by the valve) as the valve is used toreduce the ﬂow rate. Use of variable-speed operation allows inﬁnitely variable control of system ﬂow rate with high energy efﬁciency and without extra plumbing complexity. A furtheradvantage is that a variable-speed drive system offers much simpliﬁed control ofsystem ﬂow rate. The cost of efﬁcient variable-speed drive systems continues todecrease because of advances in power electronic components and circuits. The sys-tem ﬂow rate can be controlled by varying pump operating speed with impressivesavings in pumping power and energy usage. The input power reduction afforded byuse of a variable-speed drive is illustrated in Table 10.1. At 1100 gpm, the power input is cut almost 54 percent for the variable-speed system; the reduction at 600 gpm is more than 75 percent. The reduction in input power requirement at reduced ﬂow with the variable speed drive is impressive. The energy savings, and therefore the cost savings, depend on thespeciﬁc duty cycle on which the machine operates.

Estimate the annual savings in pumping energy and cost that could be achieved by implementing avariable-speed drive system. Given: Consider the variable-ﬂow, variable-pressure pumping system of Table 10.1. Assume the system operates on the typical duty cycle shown in Fig. 10.25, 24 hours per day, year round. Find: (a) An estimate of the reduction in annual energy usage obtained with the variable-speed drive. (b) The energy costs and the cost saving due to variable-speed operation. Solution: Full-time operation involves 365 days 324 hours per day, or 8760 hours per year. Thus the percentages in Fig. 10.27 may be multiplied by 8760 to give annual hours of operation. First plot the pump input power versus ﬂow rate using data from Table 10.1 to allow interpolation, as shown below. Illustrate the procedure using operation at 70 percent ﬂow rate as a sample calculation. At 70 percent ﬂow rate, the pump delivery is 0 :731700 gpm 51190 gpm. From the plot, the pump input power requirement at this ﬂow rate is 90 hp for the constant-speed drive. At this ﬂow rate, the pump operates 23 percent of the time, or 0 :233 876052015 hours per year.

Fan sizes range from that of the cooling fan in a notebook computer, which moves a cubic meter of air per hour and requires a few watts of power, to that of the ventilation fans for the Channel Tunnel, which movethousands of cubic meters of air per minute and require many hundreds of kilowatts ofpower. Fans are produced in varieties similar to those of pumps: They range fromradial-ﬂow (centrifugal) to axial-ﬂow devices. As with pumps, the characteristic curveshapes for fans depend on the fan type. Some typical performance curves for centrifugalfans are presented in Appendix D. The curves may be used to choose fans to solve someof the equipment-selection and system design problems at the end of the chapter.Summing the last column of the table shows that for the constant-speed drive system the annual energy consumptionis 7.67 310 5hp/C1hr.

Some commonly used terminology is shown on the ﬁgure. The pressure rise produced by fans is several orders of magnitude less than that for pumps. Another difference between fans and pumps is that measurement of ﬂow rate is more difﬁcult in gases and vapors than in liquids. There is no convenient analog to the catch-the-ﬂow-in-a-bucketmethod of measuring liquid ﬂow rates! Consequently, fan testing requires specialfacilities and procedures [20, 21]. Because the pressure rise produced by a fan is small,usually it is impractical to measure ﬂow rate with a restriction ﬂow meter such as anoriﬁce, ﬂow nozzle, or venturi. It may be necessary to use an auxiliary fan to developenough pressure rise to permit measurement of ﬂow rate with acceptable accuracyusing a restriction ﬂow meter. An alternative is to use an instrumented duct in which the ﬂow rate is calculated from a pitot traverse. Appropriate standards may be con- sulted to obtain complete information on speciﬁc fan-test methods and data-reductionprocedures for each application [20, 21]. The test and data reduction procedures for fans, blowers, and compressors are basically the same as for centrifugal pumps. However, blowers, and especially fans,add relatively small amounts of static head to gas or vapor ﬂows. For these machines,the dynamic head may increase from inlet to discharge, and it may be appreciablecompared with the static head rise. For these reasons, it is important to state clearly the basis on which performance calculations are made. Standard deﬁnitions are available for machine efﬁciency based on either the static-to-static pressure rise or thestatic-to-total pressure rise [20]. Data for both static and total pressure rise and forefﬁciency, based on both pressure rises, are frequently plotted on the same char-acteristic graph (Fig. 10.27). The coordinates may be plotted in physical units (e.g., inches of water, cubic feet per minute, and horsepower) or as dimensionless ﬂow and pressure coefﬁcients.The difference between the total and static pressures is the dynamic pressure, so the vertical distance between these two curves is proportional to Q Centrifugal fans are used frequently; we will use them as examples. The centrifugal fan developed from simple paddle-wheel designs, in which the wheel was a disk carrying radial ﬂat plates. (This primitive form still is used in nonclogging fans suchas in commercial clothes dryers.) Reﬁnements have led to the three general typesshown in Fig. 10.28 a/C0c, with backward-curved, radial-tipped, and forward curved blades. All the fans illustrated have blades that are curved at their inlet edges toapproximate shockless ﬂow between the blade and the inlet ﬂow direction. These three designs are typical of fans with sheet-metal blades, which are relatively simple to manufacture and thus relatively inexpensive. The forward-curved design illustrated inthe ﬁgure has very closely spaced blades; it is frequently called a squirrel-cage fan because of its resemblance to the exercise wheels found in animal cages.

The streamlined airfoil blades shown in Fig. 10.28 dare much less sensitive to inlet ﬂow direction and improve efﬁciency markedly compared with the thin blades shown in diagrams athrough c. The added expense of airfoil blades for large metal fans may be life-cycle cost effective. Airfoil blades are being used more frequently onsmall fans as impellers molded from plastic become common. As is true for pumps, the total pressure rise across a fan is approximately pro- portional to the absolute velocity of the ﬂuid at the exit from the wheel. Therefore thecharacteristic curves produced by the basic blade shapes tend to differ from eachother. The typical curve shapes are shown in Fig. 10.29, where both pressure rise and power requirements are sketched. Fans with backward-curved blade tips typically have a power curve that reaches a maximum and then decreases as ﬂow rate increases.If the fan drive is sized properly to handle the peak power, it is impossible to overloadthe drive with this type of fan. The power curves for fans with radial and forward-curved blades rise as ﬂow rate increases. If the fan operating point is higher than the design ﬂow rate, the motor maybe overloaded. Such fans cannot be run for long periods at low back pressures. Anexample of this would be when a fan is run without a load to resist the ﬂow—in other words, the fan is almost “free-wheeling.” Because the power drawn by the fan monotonically increases with ﬂow rate, the fan motor could eventually burn out underthis free-wheeling condition.Total pressure, Ht Fan static pressure, Hs Static efficiency, s Shaft power, /H5116 Volume flow rate, QTotal efficiency, tHead, efficiency, and power: H, , and /H5116ηηη Fig. 10.27 Typical characteristic curves for fan with backward-curved blades [22].

The forward-curved blade fan is preferred where low ﬁrst cost and small size are important and where service is intermittent. Forwardcurved blades require lower tip speed to produce a speciﬁed head; lower blade tipspeed means reduced noise. Thus forward-curved blades may be speciﬁed for heatingand air conditioning applications to minimize noise. Characteristic curves for axial-ﬂow ( propeller ) fans differ markedly from those for centrifugal fans. The power curve, Fig. 10.30, is especially different, as it tends todecrease continuously as ﬂow rate increases. Thus it is impossible to overload a properly sized drive for an axial-ﬂow fan. The simple propeller fan is often used for ventilation; it may be free-standing or mounted in an opening, as a window fan, with noinlet or outlet duct work. Ducted axial-ﬂow fans have been studied extensively anddeveloped to high efﬁciency [23]. Modern designs, with airfoil blades, mounted in ductsand often ﬁtted with guide vanes, can deliver large volumes against high resistanceswith high efﬁciency. The primary deﬁciency of the axial-ﬂow fan is the non-monotonicslope of the pressure characteristic: In certain ranges of ﬂow rate the fan may pulsate.Because axial-ﬂow fans tend to have high rotational speeds, they can be noisy. Selection and installation of a fan always requires compromise. To minimize energy consumption, it is desirable to operate a fan at its highest efﬁciency point. To reducethe fan size for a given capacity, it is tempting to operate at higher ﬂow rate than thatat maximum efﬁciency. In an actual installation, this tradeoff must be made con-sidering such factors as available space, initial cost, and annual hours of operation. It isnot wise to operate a fan at a ﬂow rate below maximum efﬁciency. Such a fan wouldbe larger than necessary and some designs, particularly those with forward-curvedblades, can be unstable and noisy when operated in this region. It is necessary to consider the duct system at both the inlet and the outlet of the fan to develop a satisfactory installation. Anything that disrupts the uniform ﬂow at the fan inletis likely to impair performance. Nonuniform ﬂow at the inlet causes the wheel to operateunsymmetrically and may decrease capacity dramatically.

Swirl in the direction of rotation reduces the pressure devel- oped; swirl in the opposite direction can increase the power required to drive the fan. The fan specialist may not be allowed total freedom in designing the best ﬂow system for the fan. Sometimes a poor ﬂow system can be improved without too mucheffort by adding splitters or straightening vanes to the inlet. Some fan manufacturersoffer guide vanes that can be installed for this purpose. Flow conditions at the fan discharge also affect installed performance. Every fan produces nonuniform outlet ﬂow. When the fan is connected to a length of straightduct, the ﬂow becomes more uniform and some excess kinetic energy is transformedto static pressure. If the fan discharges directly into a large space with no duct, theexcess kinetic energy of the nonuniform ﬂow is dissipated. A fan in a ﬂow system with no discharge ducting may fall considerably short of the performance measured in a laboratory test setup. The ﬂow pattern at the fan outlet may be affected by the amount of resistance present downstream. The effect of the system on fan performance may be different atdifferent points along the fan pressure-ﬂow curve. Thus, it may not be possible toaccurately predict the performance of a fan, as installed , on the basis of curves measured in the laboratory. Fans may be scaled up or down in size or speed using the basic laws developed for ﬂuid machines in Chapter 7. It is possible for two fans to operate with ﬂuids of sig-niﬁcantly different density, 8so pressure is used instead of head (which uses density) as a dependent parameter and density must be retained in the dimensionless groups. Thedimensionless groups appropriate for fan scaling are Π 15Q ωD3;Π25p ρω2D2;andΠ353 ρω3D5 ð10:29Þ Once again, dynamic similarity is assured when the ﬂow coefﬁcients are matched.

Speed control was treated thoroughly in the section on pumps. The same beneﬁts of reduced energy usage and noise are obtained with fans,and the cost of variable-speed drive systems continues to drop. Inlet dampers may be used effectively on some large centrifugal fans. However, they decrease efﬁciency and cannot be used to reduce the fan ﬂow rate below about 40percent of rated capacity. Outlet throttling is cheap but wasteful of energy. For furtherdetails, consult either Jorgensen [19] or Berry [22]; both are particularly compre-hensive. Osborne [24] also treats noise, vibration, and the mechanical design of fans.Q(cfm) p(in. H 2O) 3(hp) η(%) Q u(cfm) pu(in.

H 2O system head, with an efﬁciency of about 58 percent. This operating point is only slightly to the right of peak efﬁciency for this fan, so it is a reasonable point at which to operate the fan. The speciﬁc speed of the fan at this operating point (in U.S. customary units) is givenby direct substitution into Eq. 10.31: N scu5ωQ1=2ρ3=4 p3=45ð1150 rpm Þð110;000 cfm Þ1=2ð0:045 lbm =ft3Þ3=4 ð7:5i n:H2OÞ3=4 58223 ßNscu In nondimensional (SI) units, Ns5ð120 rad =sÞð3110 m3=sÞ1=2ð0:721 kg =m3Þ3=4 ð1:863103N=m2Þ3=4518:5ßNsðSIÞComputed fan–Type SXW, Size 7 D' = 42 in.

These combinations may be analyzed using the methods described for pumps. ASHRAE [25] and Idelchik [26] are excellent sources for loss data on air ﬂow systems. Blowers have performance characteristics similar to fans, but they operate (typi- cally) at higher speeds and increase the ﬂuid pressure more than do fans. Jorgensen [19] divides the territory between fans and compressors at an arbitrary pressure levelthat changes the air density by 5 percent; he does not demarcate between fans andblowers. 10.4 Positive Displacement Pumps Pressure is developed in positive-displacement pumps through volume reductionscaused by movement of the boundary in which the ﬂuid is conﬁned. In contrast to turbomachines, positive displacement pumps can develop high pressures at relatively low speeds because the pumping effect depends on volume change instead of dynamicaction. Positive-displacement pumps frequently are used in hydraulic systems at pressures ranging up to 40 MPa (6000 psi). A principal advantage of hydraulic power is the highpower density (power per unit weight or unit size) that can be achieved: For a given power output, a hydraulic system can be lighter and smaller than a typical electric-drive system. Numerous types of positive-displacement pumps have been developed. A few examples include piston pumps, vane pumps, and gear pumps. Within each type, pumpsmay be ﬁxed- or variable-displacement. A comprehensive classiﬁcation of pump typesis given in [16]. The performance characteristics of most positive-displacement pumps are similar; in this section we shall focus on gear pumps. This pump type typically is used, for example,to supply pressurized lubricating oil in internal combustion engines. Figure 10.31 is aschematic diagram of a typical gear pump. Oil enters the space between the gears at thebottom of the pump cavity. Oil is carried outward and upward by the teeth of the rotating gears and exits through the outlet port at the top of the cavity. Pressure is generated as the oil is forced toward the pump outlet; leakage and backﬂow are prevented by theclosely ﬁtting gear teeth at the center of the pump, and by the small clearances main-tained between the side faces of the gears and the pump housing. The close clearancesrequire the hydraulic ﬂuid to be kept extremely clean by full-ﬂow ﬁltration. Figure 10.32 is a photo showing the parts of an actual gear pump; it gives a good idea of the robust housing and bearings needed to withstand the large pressure forces Outlet InletDrive gear Driven gear Fig. 10.31 Schematic of typical gear pump [27].

It also shows pressure-loaded side plates designed to “ﬂoat”—to allow thermal expansion—while maintaining the smallest possible sideclearance between gears and housing. Many ingenious designs have been developed for pumps; details are beyond the scope of our treatment here, which will focus on performance characteristics. For more details consult Lambeck [27] or Warring [28]. Typical performance curves of pressure versus delivery for a medium-duty gear pump are shown in Fig. 10.33. The pump size is speciﬁed by its displacement perrevolution and the working ﬂuid is characterized by its viscosity and temperature.Curves for tests at three constant speeds are presented in the diagram. At each speed,delivery decreases slightly as pressure is raised. The pump displaces the same volume,but as pressure is raised, both leakage and backﬂow increase; so delivery decreases slightly. Leakage ﬂuid ends up in the pump housing; so a case drain must be provided to return this ﬂuid to the system reservoir. Volumetric efﬁciency —shown by the dashed curves—is deﬁned as actual volumetric delivery divided by pump displacement. Volumetric efﬁciency decreases as pressureis raised or pump speed is reduced. Overall efﬁciency —shown by the solid curves—is deﬁned as power delivered to the ﬂuid divided by power input to the pump. Overallefﬁciency tends to rise (and reaches a maximum at intermediate pressure) as pumpspeed increases. Thus far we have shown pumps of ﬁxed displacement only. The extra cost and com- plication of variable-displacement pumps are motivated by the energy saving they permitduring partial-ﬂow operation. In a variable-displacement pump, delivery can be variedto accommodate the load. Load sensing can be used to reduce the delivery pressureand thus the energy expenditure still further during part-load operation. Some pumpdesigns allow pressure relief to further reduce power loss during standby operation. Figure 10.34 illustrates system losses with a ﬁxed-displacement pump, compared with losses for variable-displacement and variable-pressure pumps. Assume the pressure and ﬂow required by the load at partial-ﬂow operation correspond to point L on the diagram. A ﬁxed-displacement pump will operate along curve CD; its delivery will be at point A. Since the load requires only the ﬂow at L, the remaining ﬂow Pump displacement: 5.9 in.3/rev (97 mL/rev) Overall efficiency Volumetric efficiency Speed: 1500 2000 2500 rpm 85 88 90 92 97838688 (260) (220) (180) (140) (100) (L/min)180° F (80 °C) Viscosity: 9 cSt 80 60 50 40 30 20 10 001000 (70)2000 (140)3000 (210)4000 (280) (0) Volume flow rate, gpm70Pressure, psig (bar) Fig. 10.33 Performance characteristics of typical gear pump [27].10.4 Positive Displacement Pumps 549(between LandA) must be bypassed back to the reservoir. Its pressure is dissipated by throttling. Consequently the system power loss will be the area beneath line LA. A variable-displacement pump operating at constant pressure will deliver just enough ﬂow to supply the load, but at a pressure represented by point B. The system power loss will be proportional to the area to the left of line BL. Control of delivery pressure using load sensing can be used to reduce power loss. With a load- sensing pump of variable displacement, the pressure supplied is only slightly higher than is needed to move the load. A pump with load sensing would operate at the ﬂow and pressure of point B0.The system loss would be reduced signiﬁcantly to the area to the left of line BuL. The best system choice depends on the operating duty cycle.

The main dif-ference is that the terms denoting torque, work, and power will be negative instead ofpositive. Example 10.12 below illustrates the application of the Euler turbomachineequation to a reaction turbine. Example 10.12 IDEAL ANALYSIS OF A REACTION TURBINE In a vertical-shaft Francis turbine the available head at the inlet ﬂange of the turbine is 500 ft and the verticaldistance between the runner and the tailrace is 6.5 ft. The runner tip speed is 115 ft/s, the velocity of the waterentering the runner is 130 ft/s, and the velocity of the water exiting the runner is constant and equal to 35 ft/s. Theﬂow velocity at the exit of the draft tube is 11.5 ft/s. The hydraulic energy losses estimated from the turbine are equal to 20 ft at the volute, 3.5 ft at the draft tube, and 33.0 ft at the runner. Determine the pressure head (with respect to the tailrace) at the inlet and exit of the runner, the ﬂow angle at the runner inlet, and the efﬁciency of the turbine.

Performance Characteristics for Hydraulic Turbines The test procedure for turbines is similar to that for pumps, except that a dyna- mometer is used to absorb the turbine power output while speed and torque aremeasured. Turbines usually are intended to operate at a constant speed that is afraction or multiple of the electric power frequency to be produced. Therefore turbinetests are run at constant speed under varying load, whereas water usage is measuredand efﬁciency is calculated. The impulse turbine is a relatively simple turbomachine, so we use it to illustrate typical test results. Impulse turbines are chosen when the head available exceedsabout 300 m. Most impulse turbines used today are improved versions of the Pelton wheel developed in the 1880s by American mining engineer Lester Pelton [29]. An impulse turbine is supplied with water under high head through a long conduit called apenstock . The water is accelerated through a nozzle and discharges as a high-speed free jet at atmospheric pressure. The jet strikes deﬂecting buckets attached to the rimof a rotating wheel (Fig. 10.5 a). Its kinetic energy is given up as it is turned by the buckets. Turbine output is controlled at essentially constant jet speed by changing theﬂow rate of water striking the buckets. A variable-area nozzle may be used to makesmall and gradual changes in turbine output. Larger or more rapid changes must beaccomplished by means of jet deﬂectors, or auxiliary nozzles, to avoid sudden changesin ﬂow speed and the resulting high pressures in the long water column in the pen-stock. Water discharged from the wheel at relatively low speed falls into the tailrace.The tailrace level is set to avoid submerging the wheel during ﬂooded conditions.When large amounts of water are available, additional power can be obtained by connecting two wheels to a single shaft or by arranging two or more jets to strike a single wheel. Figure 10.35 illustrates an impulse-turbine installation and the deﬁnitions of gross and net head [11]. The gross head available is the difference between the levels in the supply reservoir and the tailrace. The effective or net head ,H, used to calculate efﬁciency, is the total head at the entrance to the nozzle, measured at the nozzle centerline [11]. Hence not all of the net head is converted into work at the turbine:Some is lost to turbine inefﬁciency, some is lost in the nozzle itself, and some is lost as residual kinetic energy in the exit ﬂow. In practice, the penstock usually is sized so that at rated power the net head is 85 /C095 percent of the gross head. In addition to nozzle loss, windage, bearing friction, and surface friction between the jet and bucket reduce performance compared with the ideal, frictionless case.Figure 10.36 shows typical results from tests performed at constant head.β25tan21Vt22U2 Vn25tan21125:42115 35516:58/C14 ßβ2 α25tan21Vt2 Vn25tan21125:4 10:5585:2/C14 ßα2 (c) To calculate the efﬁciency: ηt5_Wm _Wh5gHT gHE5448 500589:6% ßηThis problemdemonstrates theanalysisofahydraulicturbinewithhead lossesandquantiﬁesthoseeffectsintermsof aturbineefﬁci ency.Inaddition,sincetheheadattheturbineexitisbelowatmo-spheric,care mustbetaken toensurethatcavit ationdoesnotoccu r.554 Chapter 10Fluid MachineryThe peak efﬁciency of the impulse turbine corresponds to the peak power, since the tests are performed at constant head and ﬂow rate. For the ideal turbine, as we will see in Example 10.13, this occurs when the wheel speed is half the jet speed. As we willsee, at this wheel speed the ﬂuid exits the turbine at the lowest absolute velocitypossible, hence minimizing the loss of kinetic energy at the exit. As indicated in Eq. 10.2a, if we minimize the exit velocity ~V 2we will maximize the turbine work _Wm, and hence the efﬁciency. In actual installations, peak efﬁciency occurs at a wheel speed only slightly less than half the jet speed. This condition ﬁxes the wheel speedonce the jet speed is determined for a given installation. For large units, overallefﬁciency may be as high as 88 percent [30].Reservoir levelEnergy grade line Hydraulic grade line Net head on wheelVB/2g2hL Gross head at plant zB Fig. 10.35 Schematic of impulse-turbine installation, showing deﬁnitions of gross and net heads [11].

Nozzle loss increases slightly and mechanical losses become a larger fraction of output as the valve is closed, so efﬁciency drops sharply at low load, as shown in Fig. 10.37. For thisPelton wheel, efﬁciency remains above 85 percent from 40 to 113 percent of full load. At lower heads, reaction turbines provide better efﬁciency than impulse turbines. In contrast to ﬂow in a centrifugal pump, used for doing work on a ﬂuid, ﬂow in awork-producing reaction turbine enters the rotor at the largest (outer) radial sectionand discharges at the smallest (inner) radial section after transferring most of itsenergy to the rotor. Reaction turbines tend to be high-ﬂow, low-head machines. A typical reaction turbine installation is shown schematically in Fig. 10.38, where the terminology used to deﬁne the heads is indicated.

Under these conditions, theoretically the absolute velocity of the ﬂuid at the exit (computed in the direction of U) would be U2ðV2UÞ5V=22ðV2V=2Þ50, so that the ﬂuid would exit with zero kinetic energy, max- imizing the power output. In practice, it is possible to deﬂect the jet stream through angles up to 165/C14. With θ5165/C14,12cosθ/C251:97, or about 1.5 percent below the value for maximum power.10.5 Hydraulic Turbines 557Reaction turbines ﬂow full of water. Consequently, it is possible to use a diffuser or draft tube to regain a fraction of the kinetic energy that remains in water leaving the rotor. The draft tube forms an integral part of the installation design. As shown inFig. 10.38, the gross head available is the difference between the supply reservoir head and the tailrace head. The effective head ornet head ,H, used to calculate efﬁciency, is the difference between the elevation of the energy grade line just upstream ofthe turbine and that of the draft tube discharge (section C). The beneﬁt of the draft tube is clear: The net head available for the turbine is equal to the gross head minuslosses in the supply pipework and the kinetic energy loss at the turbine exit. Without the draft tube the exit velocity and kinetic energy would be relatively large, but with the draft tube they are small, leading to increased turbine efﬁciency. Put anotherway, the draft tube diffuser, through a Bernoulli effect, reduces the turbine exitpressure, leading to a larger pressure drop across the turbine, and increased poweroutput. (We saw a similar Bernoulli effect used by ancient Romans in Example 8.10.) An efﬁcient mixed-ﬂow turbine runner was developed by James B. Francis using a careful series of experiments at Lowell, Massachusetts, during the 1840s [29]. Anefﬁcient axial-ﬂow propeller turbine, with adjustable blades, was developed by Ger- man Professor Victor Kaplan between 1910 and 1924. The Francis turbine (Fig. 10.5 b) is usually chosen when 15 m #H#300 m, and the Kaplan turbine (Fig. 10.5 c)i s usually chosen for heads of 15 m or less. Performance of reaction turbines may be measured in the same manner as performance of the impulse turbine. However,because the gross heads are less, any change in water level during operation is moresigniﬁcant. Consequently, measurements are made at a series of heads to completelydeﬁne the performance of a reaction turbine. An example of the data presentation for a reaction turbine is given in Fig. 10.39, where efﬁciency is shown at various output powers for a series of constant heads [6].The reaction turbine has higher maximum efﬁciency than the impulse turbine, butefﬁciency varies more sharply with load. Sizing Hydraulic Turbines for Fluid Systems Falling water has long been considered a source of “free,” renewable energy. In reality, power produced by hydraulic turbines is not free; operating costs are low, but con- siderable capital investment is required to prepare the site and install the equipment. Ata minimum, the water inlet works, supply penstock, turbine(s), powerhouse, and con-trols must be provided. An economic analysis is necessary to determine the feasibility ofdeveloping any candidate site. In addition to economic factors, hydroelectric powerField test 380 ft 430 ft 475 ft N = 138.6 rpm 140 120 100 80 Power, /H5116 (1000 hp)60 40 20 0708090100 Efficiency, (%)Expected efficiencies H = 238 ft 280 ft 330 ftη Fig. 10.39 Performance of typical reaction turbine as predicted by model tests (expected efﬁciencies) and conﬁrmed by ﬁeld test [6].558 Chapter 10Fluid Machineryplants must also be evaluated for their environmental impact; in recent years it has been found that such plants are not entirely benign and can be damaging, for example,to salmon runs. Early in the industrial revolution, waterwheels were used to power grain mills and textile machinery. These plants had to be located at the site of the falling water, whichlimited use of water power to relatively small and local enterprises. The introductionof alternating current in the 1880s made it possible to transmit electrical energyefﬁciently over long distances. Since then nearly 40 percent of the available hydro-electric power resources in the United States have been developed and connected tothe utility grid [31]. Hydroelectric power accounts for about 16 percent of the elec-trical energy produced in this country. The United States has abundant and relatively cheap supplies of fossil fuels, mostly coal. Therefore at present the remaining hydropower resources in the United Statesare not considered economical compared to fossil-ﬁred plants. Worldwide, only about one-third of available hydropower resources have been developed commercially [32]. Considerably more hydropower will likely be developedin coming decades as countries become more industrialized. Many developing coun-tries do not have their own supplies of fossil fuel. Hydropower may offer many suchcountries their only practical path to increased utility development. Consequently the design and installation of hydroelectric plants are likely to be important future engineering activities in developing countries. To evaluate a candidate site for hydropower potential, one must know the average stream ﬂow rate and the gross head available to make preliminary estimates of turbinetype, number of turbines, and potential power production. Economic analyses arebeyond the scope of this book, but we consider the ﬂuids engineering fundamentals ofimpulse turbine performance to optimize the efﬁciency. Hydraulic turbines convert the potential energy of stored water to mechanical work. To maximize turbine efﬁciency, it is always a design goal to discharge waterfrom a turbine at ambient pressure, as close to the tailwater elevation as possible andwith the minimum possible residual kinetic energy. Conveying water ﬂow into the turbine with minimum energy loss also is important. Numerous design details must be considered, such as inlet geometry, trash racks, etc.[31]. References 1, 6, 10, 31 and 33 /C038 contain a wealth of information about turbine siting, selection, hydraulic design, and optimization of hydropower plants. The num-ber of large manufacturers has dwindled to just a few, but small-scale units are becoming plentiful [35]. The enormous cost of a commercial-scale hydro plant justiﬁes the use of comprehensive scale-model testing to ﬁnalize design details. See [31] for amore detailed coverage of hydraulic power generation. Hydraulic losses in long supply pipes (known as penstocks ) must be considered when designing the installation for high-head machines such as impulse turbines; anoptimum diameter for the inlet pipe that maximizes turbine output power can bedetermined for these units, as shown in Example 10.14. Turbine power output is proportional to volume ﬂow rate times the pressure dif- ference across the nozzle. At zero ﬂow, the full hydrostatic head is available but poweris zero. As ﬂow rate increases, the net head at the nozzle inlet decreases. Power ﬁrstincreases, reaches a maximum, then decreases again as ﬂow rate increases. As we willsee in Example 10.14, for a given penstock diameter, the theoretical maximum poweris obtained when the system is designed so that one-third of the gross head is dis-sipated by friction losses in the penstock. In practice, penstock diameter is chosenlarger than the theoretical minimum, and only 10 /C015 percent of the gross head is dissipated by friction [11]. A certain minimum penstock diamete r is required to produce a given power output. The minimum diameter depends on the desired power output, the availablehead, and the penstock material and length. Some representative values are shownin Fig. 10.40.10.5 Hydraulic Turbines 559H = 2000 m 1000 m 500 mFor all curves, L = 2H and f = 0.02 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0050100150200 Penstock diameter, D (m)Ideal turbine power, /H5116 (MW) Fig. 10.40 Maximum hydraulic impulse tur- bine power output versus penstock diameter. Example 10.14 PERFORMANCE AND OPTIMIZATION OF AN IMPULSE TURBINE Consider the hypothetical impulse turbine installation shown. Analyze ﬂow in the penstock to develop an expression for the optimum turbine output power as a function of jet diameter, Dj. Obtain an expression for the ratio of jet diameter, Dj, to penstock diameter, D, at which output power is maximized. Under conditions of maximum power output, show that the head loss in the penstock is one-third of the available head. Develop a parametric equation forthe minimum penstock diameter needed to produce a speciﬁed power output, using gross head and penstock lengthas parameters. Given: Impulse turbine installation shown.

Thrust production always leaves the stream with some kinetic energy and angular momentum that are not recoverable, so the process is never 100 percent efﬁcient. The one-dimensional ﬂow model shown schematically in Fig. 10.41 is drawn in absolute coordinates on the left and as seen by an observer moving with the propeller,at speed V, on the right. The wake is modeled as a uniform ﬂow as shown, and in the new coordinates the ﬂow is steady. The actual propeller is replaced conceptually by athinactuator disk, across which ﬂow speed is continuous but pressure rises abruptly. Relative to the propeller, the upstream ﬂow is at speed Vand ambient pressure. The axial speed at the actuator disk is V1ΔV=2, with a corresponding reduction in pressure. Downstream, the speed is V1ΔVand the pressure returns to ambient. (Example 10.15 will show that half the speed increase occurs before and half after theactuator disk.) The contraction of the slipstream area to satisfy continuity andthe pressure rise across the propeller disk are shown in the ﬁgure. Not shown in the ﬁgure are the swirl velocities that result from the torque required to turn the propeller. The kinetic energy of the swirl in the slipstream also is lost unless it isremoved by a counter-rotating propeller or partially recovered in stationary guide vanes. As for all turbomachinery, propellers may be analyzed in two ways. Application of linear momentum in the axial direction, using a ﬁnite control volume, provides overallrelations among slipstream speed, thrust, useful power output, and minimum residualkinetic energy in the slipstream. A more detailed blade element theory is needed to calculate the interaction between a propeller blade and the stream.

The results obtained are discussed further below. The thrust produced is FT5_mΔV ð10:32Þ For incompressible ﬂow, in the absence of friction and heat transfer, the energyequati on indicates that the minimum required input to the propeller is the power required to increase the kinetic energy of the ﬂow, which may be expressed as 3input5_mðV1ΔVÞ2 22V2 2"# 5_m2VΔV1ðΔVÞ2 2"# 5_mVΔV11ΔV 2V/C20/C21 ð10:33Þ The useful power produced is the product of thrust and speed of advance, V, of the propeller. Using Eq. 10.32, this may be written as 3useful5FTV5_mVΔV ð10:34Þ Combining Eqs. 10.33 and 10.34, and simplifying, gives the propulsive efﬁciency as η53useful 3input51 11ΔV 2Vð10:35Þ Equations 10.32 /C010.35 are applicable to any device that creates thrust by increasing the speed of a ﬂuid stream. Thus they apply equally well to propeller-drivenor jet-propelled aircraft, boats, or ships. Equation 10.35 for propulsive efﬁciency is of fundamental importance. It indi- cates that propulsive efﬁciency can be increased by reducing ΔVor by increasing V. At constant thrust, as shown by Eq. 10.32, ΔVcan be reduced if _mis increased, i.e., if more ﬂuid is accelerated over a smalle r speed increase. More mass ﬂow can be handled if propeller diameter is increased, but overall size and tip speed ultimatelylimit this approach. The same principle is u sed to increase the propulsive efﬁciency of a turbofan engine by using a large fan to move additional air ﬂow outside theengine core. Propulsive efﬁciency also can be increased by increasing the speed of motion relative to the ﬂuid. Speed of advance may be limited by cavitation in marine appli-cations. Flight speed is limited for propeller-driven aircraft by compressibility effectsat the propeller tips, but progress is being made in the design of propellers to maintainhigh efﬁciency with low noise levels while operating with transonic ﬂow at the bladetips. Jet-propelled aircraft can ﬂy much faster than propeller-driven craft, giving themsuperior propulsive efﬁciency. The analysis provided does not reveal the length scale over which the axial velocity varies. Such an analysis is provided in [40]; the axial variation in velocity may be expressed as V clðxÞ5V1ΔV12xﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ x21R2p/C18/C19 ð10:36Þ In Eq. 10.36 Vcl(x) is the centerline velocity at location xupstream of the disk, while Vis the upstream velocity. This relationship is plotted in Fig. 10.42. The plot shows that the effects of the propeller are only felt at distances within two radii of the actuator disk. A more detailed blade element theory may be used to calculate the interaction between a propeller blade and the stream and therefore to determine the effects ofblade aerodynamic drag on the propeller efﬁciency. If the blade spacing is large and the10.6 Propellers and Wind-Power Machines 565disk loading9is light, blades can be considered independent, and relations can be derived for the torque required and the thrust produced by a propeller. These approximate relations are most accurate for low-solidity propellers.10Aircraft pro- pellers typically are of fairly low solidity, having long, thin blades. A schematic diagram of an element of a rotating propeller blade is shown in Fig. 10.43. The blade is set at angle θto the plane of the propeller disk and has a thickness (into the plane of the page) of dr. Flow is shown as it would be seen by an observer on the propeller blade. Lift and drag forces are exerted on the blade per-pendicular and parallel to the relative velocity vector V r, respectively. We call the angle that Vrmakes with the plane of the propeller disk the effective pitch angle ,φ, and therefore the lift and drag forces are inclined at an angle to the propeller rotationaxis and the plane of the propeller disk, respectively. The relative speed of ﬂow, V r, passing over the blade element depends on both the blade peripheral speed, rω, and the speed of advance ,V. Consequently, for a given blade setting, the angle of attack, α, depends on both V andrω. Thus, the performance of a propeller is inﬂuenced by both ωandV. If we take a free-body diagram of the airfoil element of width drin Fig. 10.43, we ﬁnd that the magnitude of the resultant force dFrparallel to the velocity vector ~V: dFT5dLcosφ2dDsinφ5qrcdrðCLcosφ2CDsinφÞ ð10:37aÞ1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2Dimensionless velocity (Vcl/H11002V)/ΔV 0.0 012 Dimensionless distance from propeller, x /R34 Fig. 10.42 Plot of velocity versus distance for ﬂow of air near a propeller.

In general, due to twist and taper in the propeller blades, and the radial variation of the blade peripheral speed, CL,CD,Vr,c,φ, and qrwill all be functions of the radial coordinate r.

We will use the equations above to analyze the startup characteristics of a pro- peller in Example 10.16. Example 10.16 PROPELLER STARTUP THRUST AND TORQUE Use blade element theory to estimate the start-up thrust and torque for a propeller consisting of Nindependent blades with constant chord length, c, and at a constant angle, θ, with respect to the actuator disk plane. Given: Propeller with Nindependent blades Chord length cis constant Angle with respect to actuator disk θis constant Find: Expressions for startup thrust and torque Solution: Apply the equations presented above to the propeller: Governing equations: dFT5dLcosφ2dDsinφ5qrcdrðCLcosφ2CDsinφÞ ð10:37aÞ dT5rðdLsinφ1dDcosφÞ5qrrcdrðCLsinφ1CDcosφÞ ð10:37bÞ FT5qNZR RhubðCLcosφ2CDsinφÞ sin2φcdr ð10:38aÞ T5qNZR RhubðCLsinφ1CDcosφÞ sin2φrcdr ð10:38bÞ Assumptions: Local wind velocity Vis negligible. Angular velocity ωis constant.10.6 Propellers and Wind-Power Machines 567While these expressions may be relatively simple to derive, they are difﬁcult to evaluate. Even if the geometry of the propeller is adjusted to give constant geometric pitch,11the ﬂow ﬁeld in which it operates may not be uniform. Thus, the angle of attack across the blade elements may vary from the ideal, and it can be calculated only with the aid of a comprehensive computer code that can predict local ﬂow directionsand speeds. As a result, Eqs. 10.38 are not normally used, and propeller performancecharacteristics usually are measured experimentally. Figure 10.44 shows typical measured characteristics for a marine propeller [6] and for an aircraft propeller [41]. The variables used to plot the characteristics are almostdimensionless: by convention, rotational speed, n, is expressed in revolutions per second (rather than as ω, in radians per second). The independent variable is the speed of advance coefﬁcient ,J, J/C17V nDð10:39ÞIf at start-up we neglect the local wind velocity V, we ﬁnd that the integrals in Eqs. 10.38 will be indeterminate since q50a n d φ50. Therefore, we will use the differential thrust and torque expressions given in Eqs. 10.37 and inte- grate them. At start-up, the relative velocity Vris simply equal to the local blade element velocity rω. Therefore, the relative dynamic pressure qris equal to: qr51 2ρr2ω2 When φ50, the differential thrust and torque expressions become dFT512ρr 2ω2cdrðCLcos 02CDsin 0 Þ512ρω 2cCLr2dr dT512ρr 2ω2rcdrðCLsin 01CDcos 0 Þ512ρω 2cCDr3dr We can then integrate the thrust and torque over the entire actuator disk: FT5NZ dFT512ρω 2cCLZR Rhubr2dr512ρω 2cCL313R 32R3 hub/C0/C1 T5NZ dT51 2ρω2cCDZR Rhubr3dr512ρω 2cCD314R 42R4 hub/C0/C1 When we collect terms and simplify we get the following expressions: FTstartup5ρω2cCL 6R32R3hub/C0/C1 ßFTstartup Tstartup5ρω2cCD 8ðR42R4 hubÞßTstartupThis prob lemdemonstratestheanalysisofaprop ellerusingbladeelementthe-ory.

The pitch, H, of this blade element is equal to 2 πrtanθ. To obtain constant pitch along the blade, θmust follow the relation, tan θ5H/2πr, from hub to tip. Thus the geometric blade angle is smallest at the tip and increases steadily toward the root.568 Chapter 10Fluid MachineryDependent variables are the thrust coefﬁcient ,CF, the torque coefﬁcient ,CT, the power coefﬁcient ,CP, and the propeller efﬁciency ,η, deﬁned as CF5FT ρn2D4;CT5T ρn2D5;CP53 ρn3D5;and η5FTV 3inputð10:40Þ The performance curves for both propellers show similar trends. Both thrust and torque coefﬁcients are highest, and efﬁciency is zero, at zero speed of advance. This corresponds to the largest angle of attack for each blade element ( α5αmax5θ). Efﬁciency is zero because no useful work is being done by the stationary propeller. As advance speed increases, thrust and torque decrease smoothly. Efﬁciency increases toa maximum at an optimum advance speed and then decreases to zero as thrust tends tozero. (For example, if the blade element section is symmetric, this would theoret-ically occur when α50, or when tan θ5V/ωr.) In order to improve performance, some propellers are designed with variable pitch. The performance of a variable-pitch propeller is shown in Fig. 10.45. This ﬁgure showsefﬁciency curves (solid curves) for a propeller set to different pitch angles. As we sawin Fig. 10.44, the propeller exhibits a maximum ηat a certain value of J. However, the value of Jneeded for maximum ηvaries with θ. If we trace out all of the maxima, the result is the dashed curve in Fig. 10.45.

Such a design, however, comes at the cost of the additional complexity in actuators and control systems needed to implement the variable pitch, so the selection of this design depends on the relative costs and beneﬁts for the intended application. Example 10.17 SIZING A MARINE PROPELLER Consider the supertanker of Example 9.5. Assume the total power required to overcome viscous resistance and wave drag is 11.4 MW.

This packs a lot of lifting surface within the swept area of the disk to keep the pressure difference small across the propeller and to avoid cavitation. Cavitation tends to unload the blades of a marine propeller, reducing both the torque required and the thrust produced [6]. Cavitation becomes more prevalent along the blades as the cavitation number, Ca5p2pv 1 2ρV2ð10:41Þ is reduced. Inspection of Eq. 10.41 shows that Cade creases when pis reduced by operating near the free surface or by increasing V. Those who have operated motor boats also are aware that local cavitation can be caused by distorted ﬂow approaching the propeller, e.g., from turning sharply. Compressibility affects aircraft propellers when tip speeds approach the critical Mach number , at which the local Mach number approaches M51 at some point on the blade. Under these conditions, torque increases because of increased drag, thrust drops because of reduced section lift, and efﬁciency drops drastically. If a propeller operates within the boundary layer of a propelled body, where the relative ﬂow is slowed, its apparent thrust and torque may increase comparedwith those in a uniform freestream at the same rate of advance. The residual kinetic energy in theslipstream also may be reduced. The combination of these effects may increase the overallpropulsive efﬁciency of the combined body and propeller. Advanced computer codes areused in the design of modern ships (and submarines, where noise may be an overridingconsideration) to optimize performance of each propeller/hull combination. For certain special applications, a propeller may be placed within a shroud orduct. Such conﬁgurations may be integrated into a hull (e.g., as a bow thruster to increasemaneuverability), built into the wing of an aircraft, or placed on the deck of a hover-craft. Thrust may be improved by the favorable pressure forces on the duct lip, butefﬁciency may be reduced by the added skin-friction losses encountered in the duct. Wind-Power Machines Windmills (or more properly, wind turbines) have been used for centuries to harnessthe power of natural winds.

Calvert [43] reports that, based on his laboratory-scale tests, a traditional Dutch windmill of 26 m diameter produced 41 kW in a wind of 36 km/hr at an angular speed of 20 rpm.American multi-blade windmills (Fig. 10.46 b) were found on many American farms between about 1850 and 1950. They performed valuable service in powering waterpumps before rural electriﬁcation. The recent emphasis on renewable resources has revived interest in windmill design and optimization. In 2008, the United States had over 25,000 MW of wind-based electric generation capacity, which generated 52 million MWh of electricity, representing 1.26 percent of the total electric energy consumption for that year [44]. In addition, in 2008 the United States overtook Germany to become the largestgenerator of wind-based electrical power in the world. Wind power accounts for 42percent of allnew generating capacity, up from only 2 percent in 2004. America’s wind belt, which stretches across the Great Plains from Texas to the Dakotas, has beendubbed the “Saudi Arabia of wind” [45]. Schematics of wind turbine conﬁgurations are shown in Fig. 10.47. In general, wind turbines are classiﬁed in two ways. The ﬁrst classiﬁcation is the orientation of the turbine axis. Horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) and vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) conﬁgurations have been studied extensively. Most HAWT designs featuretwo- or three-bladed propellers turning at high speed, mounted on a tower alongwith its electric generator. The large modern HAWT, shown in Fig. 10.48 a, is capable of producing power in any wind above a light breeze. The wind turbine shown inFig. 10.48 bis a VAWT. This device uses a modern symmetric airfoil section for the rotor. Earlier designs of the VAWT, such as the Darrieus troposkien shape, 12suffered from high bending stresses and pulsatory torques. More recent designs, such as the one shown in this ﬁgure, feature helical airfoils, which distribute the torques more evenly about the central axis. VAWTs feature a ground-mounted electric generator. The second classiﬁcation is how the wind energy is harnessed. The ﬁrst group of turbines collects wind energy through drag forces; these wind turbines are typicallyof the vertical axis conﬁguration only. The second group collects energy through liftforces. Lift-based wind turbines employ horizontal- or vertical-axis conﬁgurations. Itis important to note that most of these designs are self-starting. The lift-type VAWT is 12This shape (which would be assumed by a ﬂexible cord whirled about a vertical axis) minimizes bending stresses in the Darrieus turbine rotor.

It is typically combined with a self-starting turbine, such as a Savonius rotor, to provide starting torque [40, 46]. A horizontal-axis wind turbine may be analyzed as a propeller operated in reverse. The Rankine model of one-dimensional ﬂow incorporating an idealized actuator disk is shown in Fig. 10.49. The simpliﬁed notation of the ﬁgure is frequently used foranalysis of wind turbines. The wind speed far upstream is V. The stream is decelerated to V(1/C0a) at the turbine disk and to V(1/C02a) in the wake of the turbine ( ais called the interference factor ). Thus the stream tube of air captured by the wind turbine is small upstream and its diameter increases as it moves downstream.

This kinetic energy ﬂux is KEF51 2ρV3πR2ð10:44Þ Combining Eqs. 10.43 and 10.44 gives the efﬁciency (or alternatively, the power coefﬁc ient[47]) as η53 KEF54að12aÞ2ð10:45Þ Betz [see 47] was the ﬁrst to derive this result and to show that the theoretical efﬁ- cienc y is maximized when a51/3. The maximum theoretical efﬁciency is η50.593. If the wind turbine is lightly loaded ( ais small), it will affect a large mass of air per unit time, but the energy extracted per unit mass will be small and the efﬁciency low.Most of the kinetic energy in the initial air stream will be left in the wake and wasted.If the wind turbine is heavily loaded ( a/C251/2), it will affect a much smaller mass of air per unit time. The energy removed per unit mass will be large, but the power pro-duced will be small compared with the kinetic energy ﬂux through the undisturbedarea of the actuator disk. Thus a peak efﬁciency occurs at intermediate disk loadings. The Rankine model includes some important assumptions that limit its applica- bility [47]. First, the wind turbine is assumed to affect only the air contained within thestream tube deﬁned in Fig. 10.49. Second, the kinetic energy produced as swirl behindthe turbine is not accounted for. Third, any radial pressure gradient is ignored.Glauert [see 41] partially accounted for the wake swirl to predict the dependence ofideal efﬁciency on tip-speed ratio, X, X5Rω Vð10:46Þ as shown in Fig. 10.50 ( ωis the angular velocity of the turbine). As the tip-speed ratio increases, ideal efﬁciency increases, approaching the peak value ( η50.593) asymptotically. (Physically, the swirl left in the wake is reduced as the tip-speed ratio increases.) Avallone et al. [46] presents a summary of the detailed blade-element theory used to develop the limiting efﬁciency curve shown in Fig. 10.50.Turbine diskControl volume VV (1 – 2a)V (1 – a) Fig. 10.49 Control volume and simpliﬁed notation used to analyze wind turbine performance.574 Chapter 10Fluid MachineryEach type of wind turbine has its most favorable range of application. The tradi- tional American multibladed windmill has a large number of blades and operates at relatively slow speed. Its solidity, σ(the ratio of blade area to the swept area of the turbine disk, πR2), is high. Because of its relatively slow operating speed, its tip-speed ratio and theoretical performance limit are low. Its relatively poor performance, compared with its theoretical limit, is largely caused by use of crude blades, which aresimply bent sheet metal surfaces rather than airfoil shapes. It is necessary to increase the tip-speed ratio considerably to reach a more favor- able operating range. Modern high-speed wind-turbine designs use carefully shapedairfoils and operate at tip-speed ratios up to 7 [48].Savonius rotorAmerican farm windmillModern multiblade turbine Darrieus rotorIdeal efficiency of propeller-type turbineHigh-speed two- or three- bladed turbine 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 000.10.20.30.40.50.6Power coefficient, Cp = –––––––––––/H5116 1__ 2ρV3 R2 π Turbine tip-speed ratio, X = R /V ω Fig. 10.50 Efﬁciency trends of wind turbine types versus tip-speed ratio [43].

The main reason for this difference can be seen in Fig. 10.51. In this ﬁgure, a cross section of one airfoil in a Darrieus turbine is shown rotating about the turbine axis. Assuming thatthe wind emanates from a constant direction, the airfoil angle of attack αwill be a function of the azimuthal angle θ. The angle of attack is due to the relation between the effective velocity vector and the rotational direction. As θvaries, αwill vary as well until it reaches a maximum value when θis equal to 90 /C14. In that conﬁguration, the angle of attack is expressed by: αm5tan21V Rωð10:47aÞTo ﬁnd the condition for maximum possible efﬁciency, set dη/daequal to zero. The maximum efﬁciency is η50:593, which occurs when a51=3. The Dutch windmill tested by Calvert had a tip-speed ratio of X5NR V520rev min32πrad rev3min 60 s313 m3s 10 m52:72 ßX The maximum theoretically attainable efﬁciency at this tip-speed ratio, accounting for swirl (Fig. 10.45), would be about 0.53.

The actual thrust on the Dutch windmill can only be estimated, because the interference factor, a, is not known.

However, V536 km =hr is only a moderate wind. The actual machine would have to withstand much more severe wind conditions during storms.This problemillustratesapplicationoftheconceptsofidealthrust,power,andefﬁci encyforawindmill,andcalculationofthesequantities foranactualmachine.10.6 Propellers and Wind-Power Machines 577Equation 10.47a states that the maximum angle of attack is related to the wind velocity, the angular velocity of the rotor, and the local rotor radius. In terms of the tip speedratio Xfrom Eq. 10.46, Eq. 10.47a may then be rewritten as: α m5tan211 Xð10:47bÞ Since the maximum angle of attack must be less than that for stall (10/C14/C015/C14for most typical airfoils), it follows that Xshould be a large number (at least on the order of 6). The lift and drag forces ( LandD, respectively) acting on the airfoil can be seen in Fig. 10.51. These aerodynamic forces generate a torque on the rotor. The torque onthe rotor at a given value of αis: T5ωRðLsinα2DcosαÞ ð10:48Þ Now if the airfoil section being employed is symmetric (zero camber), then the liftcoe fﬁcient is linearly proportional to the angle of attack [49]: CL5mα ð10:49Þ In Eq. 10.49, mis the slope of the lift curve, and is speciﬁc to the airfoil being used. In addition, the drag coefﬁcient may be approximated by: CD5CD;01C2 L πARð9:43Þ In this expression, CD,0is the drag coefﬁcient at zero angle of attack, and ARis the aspect ratio of the airfoil. Now since the air velocity relative to the rotor is a functionofα, which depends on θ, it follows that the lift and drag forces are functions of θas well. Therefore, any quantiﬁcation of rotor performance needs to be averaged over the entire range of θ. Decher [40] derived an expression for the efﬁciency of the rotor based on lift and drag effects, η L/D. This expression is deﬁned as the useful work outD LVV VrelVrel θααθ/H11002α θ αm Rω /H11005 XVRωθ /H11005 π/2 Fig. 10.51 Velocities around a Darrieus rotor blade ele- ment at a general azimuthal angle θ, as well as at θ5π/2, where the airfoil angle of attack is maximized.578 Chapter 10Fluid Machinery(the torque in Eq. 10.48) divided by the available power in the wind. In terms of the lift and drag, this expression is: ηL=D5RωðLsinα2DcosαÞ VðLcosα1DsinαÞ The overbars in this equation indicate average values of those quantities. Since the liftand drag forces on the rotor change with θ, a time average of the forces needs to be calculated by integrating. Now once we substitute Eqs. 10.49 and 9.43 into thisexpression and average over a full revolution of the rotor (0 #θ#2π), the efﬁciency becomes: ηL=D512CD;02 CD;0AR14X3 11X2/C18/C19 11CD;01 2π13 2CD;0ARX2/C18/C19 ð10:50Þ This efﬁciency modiﬁes the efﬁciency based on actuator disk theory (Eq. 10.45) for anestima te of the overall efﬁciency of the rotor: η/C25ηact disk ηL=D ð10:51Þ One must keep in mind, however, that in order to determine the efﬁciency of acompl ete rotor, one must add the contributions to the torque over the entire rotor. Since different parts of the rotor have different radii (different values of R), they will have different values of X. Based on Eq. 10.50, one might realize that the portions of the rotor with small radii will contribute very little to the torque compared to centralportions of the rotor. Example 10.19 ANALYSIS OF A GIROMILL A Giromill wind turbine (see Fig. 10.47) has a height of 140 ft and a diameter of 110 ft. The airfoil section being usedis a constant-width symmetric section with a stall angle of 12 /C14and an aspect ratio of 50. Over the normal range of operation the airfoil lift coefﬁcient can be described by the equation CL50.1097 α, where αis the angle of attack in degrees. The drag coefﬁcient at zero angle of attack is 0.006, and at other angles of attack the drag coefﬁcient can beapproximated by Eq. 9.43. If the Giromill rotates at 24 rpm, calculate the maximum allowable wind speed to avoidstall on the airfoil section. If the power generated at this minimum speed condition is 160 hp, what is the efﬁciency ofthe turbine?

This is especially important in gas turbine (Brayton cycle) powergeneration (for both stationary and mobile power plants) and in steam turbine(Rankine cycle) power generation. We will investigate the modiﬁcations to the gov-erning equations and dimensional analyses necessary in compressible ﬂow applica-tions. Where necessary, the reader is directed to the appropriate sections in Chapters12 and 13 for further clariﬁcation. Application of the Energy Equation to a Compressible Flow Machine In Chapter 4 we looked at the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics for an arbitrary control volume. The result was the energy equation, Eq. 4.56, _Q2_Ws2_Wshear2_Wother5@ @tZ CVeρdV---1Z CSu1pv1V2 21gz/C18/C19 ρ~V/C1d~A ð4:56Þ Equation 4.56 states that the heat added to the system, minus the work done by thesystem results in an increase in energy for the system. In this equation, the work done by the system is assumed to consist of three parts. The ﬁrst, known as “shaft work,” isthe useful work input/output we consider in the analysis of turbomachines. The secondis the work done by ﬂuid shear stresses at the control volume surface. The third,referred to as “other work,” includes sources such as electromagnetic energy transfer. We will now simplify Eq. 4.56 for compressible ﬂow turbomachinery. First, tur- bomachines typically run at conditions such that heat transfer with the surroundingsare minimized, and so the heat transfer term may be ignored. Second, work termsother than shaft work should be negligibly small, and so they can be ignored as well.Third, changes in gravitational potential energy should be small, and so that term canbe dropped from the surface integral. Since enthalpy is deﬁned as h/C17u1pv, for steady ﬂow, Eq. 4.56 becomes _W s52Z CSh1V2 2/C18/C19 ρ~V/C1d~A At this point, we introduce the stagnation enthalpy13as the sum of the ﬂuid enthalpy and kinetic energy: h05h1V2 2 Therefore, we may rewrite the energy equation as: _Ws52Z CSh0ρ~V/C1d~A ð10:52aÞ Equation 10.52a states that, for a turbomachine with work input , the power required causes an increase in the stagnation enthalpy in the ﬂuid; for a turbomachine with work output , the power produced is due to a decrease in the stagnation enthalpy of the ﬂuid. 13See Section 12.3 for a discussion of the stagnation state.10.7 Compressible Flow Turbomachines 581In this equation, _Wsis positive when work is being done bythe ﬂuid (as in a turbine), while _Wsis negative when work is being done onthe ﬂuid (as in a compressor). It is important to note that the sign convention used in this equation appears to be contrary to that used in the Euler turbomachine equation, developed in Section 10.2. If you recall, in Eq. 10.2 a positive value of _Wpindicated work done on the ﬂuid, while a negative value indicated work done by the ﬂuid. The difference to remember is that _Wsis the mechanical power exerted bythe working ﬂuid on its surroundings, i.e., the rotor, whereas _Wpis the mechanical power exerted onthe working ﬂuid by the rotor. Keeping this distinction in mind, it makes perfect sense that these two quantitieswould have equal magnitudes and opposite signs. The integrand on the right side of Eq. 10.52a is the product of the stagnation enthalpy with the mass ﬂow rate at each section. If we make the additional assumptionof uniform ﬂow into the machine at section 1, and out of the machine at section 2,Eq. 10.52a becomes _Ws52ðh022h01Þ_m ð10:52bÞ Compressors Compressors may be centrifugal or axial, depending on speciﬁc speed. Automotive turbochargers, small gas-turbine engines, and natural-gas pipeline boosters usually are centrifugal. Large gas and steam turbines and jet aircraft engines (as seen in Figs. 10.3 and 10.4 b) frequently are axial-ﬂow machines. Since the ﬂow through a compressor will see a change in density, the dimensional analysis presented for incompressible ﬂow is no longer appropriate. Rather, wequantify the performance of a compressor through Δh 0s, the ideal rise in stagnation enthalpy of the ﬂow,14the efﬁciency η,a n dt h ep o w e r 3. The functional relationship is: Δh0s;η;35fðμ;N;D;_m;ρ01;c01;kÞ ð10:53Þ In this relation, the independent variables are, in order, viscosity, rotational speed, rotor diameter, mass ﬂow rate, inlet stagnation density, inlet stagnation speed of sound, and ratio of speciﬁc heats. If we apply the Buckingham Pi theorem to this system, the resulting dimensionless groups are: Π15Δh0s ðNDÞ2Π253 ρ01N3D5 Π35_m ρ01ND3Π45ρ01ND2 μ Π55ND c01 Since the efﬁciency ηand ratio of speciﬁc heats kare dimensionless quantities, they can be thought of as Π-terms. The resulting functional relationships are: 14In Section 12.1, it is demonstrated that an adiabatic and reversible process is isentropic. It can be proven that an isentropic compression results in the minimum power input between two ﬁxed pressures, and an isentropic expansion results in the maximum power output between two ﬁxed pressures. Therefore, the isentropic compression/expansion process is considered the ideal for compressors and turbines, respectively. For more information, please consult Moran and Shapiro [50].582 Chapter 10Fluid MachineryΔh0s ðNDÞ2;η;3 ρ01N3D55f1_m ρ01ND3;ρ01ND2 μ;ND c01;k ! ð10:54aÞ This equation is actually an expression of three separate functions; that is, the terms Π15Δh0s=ðNDÞ2,η, andΠ253=ρ01N3D5are all functions of the other dimensionless quantities. Δh0s=ðNDÞ2is a measure of the energy change in the ﬂow and is the compressible analog to the head coefﬁcient Ψ(Eq. 10.6). 3=ρ01N3D5is a power coefﬁcient, similar to that in Eq. 10.8. _m=ρ01ND3is a mass ﬂow coefﬁcient, analogous to the incompressible ﬂow coefﬁcient Φ(Eq. 10.5). ρ01ND2=μis a Reynolds number based on rotor tip speed, and ND=c01is a Mach number based on rotor tip speed. Using the relationships for isentropic processes and for the compressible ﬂow of aperfect gas, we can make some simpliﬁcations. As a result, Eq. 10.54a may berewritten as: p02 p01;η;ΔT0 T015f2_mﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃRT01p p01D2;Re;NDﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃRT01p ;k ! ð10:54bÞ The functional relationships presented here can be used in the manner seen both in Chapt er 7 and earlier in this chapter to investigate scaling the performance of similar ﬂow machines. An example of this is presented in the following example. Example 10.20 SCALING OF A COMPRESSOR A 1/5 scale model of a prototype air compressor consuming 300 hp and running at a speed of 1000 rpm delivers a ﬂow rate of 20 lbm/s through a pressure ratio of 5. At dynamically and kinematically similar conditions, what would theoperating speed, mass ﬂow rate, and power consumption be for the full-scale prototype? Given: 1/5 scale compressor model Power: 300 hp Speed: 1000 rpmPressure ratio: 5Mass ﬂow rate: 50 lbm/s Find: Prototype speed, mass ﬂow rate, and power consumption at similar conditions. Solution: Apply the equations presented above and the concepts presented in Chapter 7 on similitude to the compressor: Governing equations: ND c01/C18/C19 p5ND c01/C18/C19 m _m ρ01ND3 ! p5_m ρ01ND3 ! m 3 ρ01N3D5 ! p53 ρ01N3D5 ! m Assumption: Similar entrance conditions for both model and prototype. Similar entrance conditions would stipulate that the stagnation sound speed and density would be equal for both the model and the prototype. Solving the ﬁrst equation for the prototype speed:10.7 Compressible Flow Turbomachines 583Since most operability studies are performed on a single compressor design without scaling, and, using the same working ﬂuid, all variables related to the scale and the ﬂuid (speciﬁcally, D,R, and k) may be eliminated from the functional relationship. In addition, empirical studies have shown that, as in the case study of the centrifugalpump in Chapter 7, for sufﬁciently high values of Reynolds number the performanceof the compressor is not dependent upon Reynolds number either; i.e., the ﬂow is fullyturbulent in the compressor. Once these variables are eliminated, Eq. 10.54b becomes p02 p01;η;ΔT0 T015f3_mﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃT01p p01;NﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃT 01p ! ð10:54cÞ Note that this equation is no longer dimensionless. However, it is still useful in char- ac terizing the performance of a compressor, provided the performance is assessed for a single machine using a single working ﬂuid. The relationship portrayed in Eq. 10.54c is normally expressed in the form of a compressor operability map, as shown in Fig. 10.52. On this map we can see the compression ratio versus mass ﬂow ratio ð_mﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃT01p=p01Þ,w i t h curves of constant normalized speed ðN=ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃT 01pÞand efﬁciency. Often, the abscissa is a “corrected mass ﬂow”: _mcorr5_mﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ T01=Trefp p01=pref and the lines of constant compressor speed are a “corrected speed”: Ncorr5NﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃT 01=Trefp In these expressions, Trefandprefare reference pressure and temperature (usually standard conditions one would expect at the entrance of such a machine). This allows the user to read the chart quickly in terms of “real” physical quantities and to be able to make adjustments for varying entrance conditions with a minimum of calculation.The operating line is the locus of points of maximum efﬁciency for a given mass ﬂow.Np5NmDm Dpc01p c01m51000 rpm 31 5315200 rpm Np5200 rpm ßNp Solving the second equation for the prototype mass ﬂow rate: _mp5_mmρ01p ρ01mNp NmDp Dm0 @1A3 520lbm s3200 100035 10 @1A3 5500lbm s _mp5500 lbm =sß_mp To calculate the power requirement for the prototype: 3p53mρ01p ρ01mNp Nm/C18/C193Dp Dm/C18/C195 5300 hp3200 1000/C18/C193 35 1/C18/C195 57500 hp 3p57500 hp ßPpThis problemdemonstratesthescalingofcompressibleﬂow machines.Notethatiftheworkingﬂuidforthetwodif-ferentscalemachinesweredifferent,e.g.,airversushelium,theeffects ofdifferentgasconstantsand speciﬁcheatratios wouldhavetobetakeninto account.584 Chapter 10Fluid MachineryIt is important to note that the compressor operability map of Fig. 10.52 bears a striking resemblance to the pump operability map of Fig. 10.14. Not only do both ﬁgures show the performance of a turbomachine performing work on a ﬂuid, but the data are plotted in a similar fashion; level curves of constant efﬁciency are plotted on a plane of work output (head for the pump, pressure ratio for the compressor) versus ﬂow input (volumetric ﬂow rate for the pump, mass ﬂow rate for the compressor). This ﬁgure shows two of the phenomena that must be avoided in the operation of a compressor. The ﬁrst is choking , which is experienced when the local Mach number at some point in the compressor reaches unity.15To explain choking in a physical sense, imagine that we run the compressor at constant speed and constant inlet pressure and that we can directly control the compressor exit pressure. On the compressor map, we would be traveling along a line of constant normalized speed. If we were to lower the exit pressure, the pressure ratio would decrease. If the compressor speed remains constant, the mass ﬂow increases. However, we see that the lines of constant nor- malized speed turn downward if the mass ﬂow rate is increased beyond a certain value, indicating a maximum possible ﬂow rate for a given rotor speed, and the compressor is choked. When choking occurs, it is impossible to increase mass ﬂow without increasing rotor speed. The second phenomenon is surge , which is a cyclic pulsation phenomenon that causes the mass ﬂow rate through the machine to vary, and can even reverse it! Surge occurs when the pressure ratio in the compressor is raised beyond a certain level for a given mass ﬂow rate. As pressure ratio increases, the adverse pressure gradient across the compressor increases as well. This increase in pressure gradient can cause boundary-layer separation on the rotor surfaces and constrict ﬂow through the space between two adjacent blades.16 Therefore, the extra ﬂow gets diverted to the next channel between blades. The separa- tion is relieved in the previous channel and moves to the next channel, causing the cyclic pulsation mentioned above. Surge is accompanied by loud noises and can damage the compressor or related components; it too must be avoided. Fig. 10.52 shows the surge line , the locus of operating conditions beyond which surge will occur. In general, as shown in Fig. 10.52, the higher the performance, the more narrow the range in which the compressor may be operated successfully. Thus a compressor must be carefully matched to its ﬂow system to assure satisfactory operation. Compressor matching in natural gas pipeline applications is discussed by Vincent-Genod [51].Maximum efficiencyOperating lineConstant efficiency line Surge linePressure ratio, p02/p01 Corrected mass flow rate,p01m T01.N/ lineT01Constant Fig. 10.52 Performance map for a compressor. 15Choking is also described from the standpoint of nozzle ﬂow in Section 13.2. 16Boundary layer separation due to adverse pressure gradients is discussed in Section 9.6.10.7 Compressible Flow Turbomachines 585Perhaps the most common application of high-speed ﬂuid machinery today is in automotive turbochargers (worldwide many millions of cars are sold each year with turbochargers). Automotive turbocharger matching is described in manufacturers’ literature [52]. Compressible-Flow Turbines The ﬂow through a gas turbine is governed by the same general relationship as the compressor, but the actual functional relationships are different. Figure 10.53 shows the performance map for a compressible ﬂow turbine. As in the case for the com- pressor the turbine map shows lines of constant normalized speed on a graph of pressure ratio versus normalized mass ﬂow rate. The most striking difference between this map and that for the compressor is that the performance is a very weak function ofN=ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃT01p; the curves are set very close together. The choking of the turbine ﬂow is well-deﬁned on this map: There is a normalized mass ﬂow that cannot be exceeded in the turbine, regardless of the pressure ratio.ChokingPressure ratio, p02/p01 Corrected mass flow rate,p01m T01.N/ lineT01Constant Fig. 10.53 Performance map for a compressible ﬂow turbine. 10.8 Summary and Useful Equations In this chapter, we: üDeﬁnedthe two major types of ﬂuid machines: positive displacement machines and turbomachines. üDeﬁned, within the turbomachine category, radial, axial, and mixed-ﬂow types, pumps, fans, blowers, compressors, and impulse and reaction turbines. üDiscussed various features of turbomachines, such as impellers, rotors, runners, scrolls (volutes), compressor stages, and draft tubes. üUsed the angular-momentum equation for a control volume to derive the Euler turbomachine equation. üDrew velocity diagrams and applied the Euler turbomachine equation to the analysis of various idealized machines to derive ideal torque, head, and power. üEvaluated the performance—head, power, and efﬁciency—of various actual machines from measured data. üDeﬁned and used dimensionless parameters to scale the performance of a ﬂuid machine from one size, operating speed, and set of operating conditions to another. üDiscussed various deﬁning parameters, such as pump efﬁciency, solidity, hydraulic power, mechanical power, turbine efﬁciency, shutoff head, shock loss, speciﬁc speed, cavitation, NPSHR , and NPSHA .586 Chapter 10Fluid MachineryüExamined pumps for their compliance with the constraint that the net positive suction head available exceeds that required to avoid cavitation. üMatched ﬂuid machines for doing work on a ﬂuid to pipe systems to obtain the operating point (ﬂow rate and head). üPredicted the effects of installing ﬂuid machines in series and parallel on the operating point of a system. üDiscussed and analyzed turbomachines without housings, namely propellers and wind turbines. üDiscussed the use and performance of compressible ﬂow turbomachines.

Silicon gas-turbine engines suitable for powering laptops or cell phones; a 6-mm-diameter turbine assembly. (Courtesy of Dr. AlanEpstein, M.I.T.) Alan Epstein, a professor of aeronautics and astro- nautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,and his team have done a lot of research on tiny gas-turbine engines made of silicon. They are about thesize of a quarter (as shown in the ﬁgure) and can beeasily mass produced. Unlike conventional large tur-bines that are assembled from many components,these turbines are built basically from a solid piece of silicon. Professor Epstein discovered that the basic concepts of turbine theory (discussed in this chapter)apply even to his microturbines; the ﬂuid mechanicsturns out to be the same as that for larger engines, aslong as the passages made for gas ﬂow are larger thanabout 1 μm in diameter (smaller than this and non- continuum molecular kinetics is needed). The rotor and its airfoils are carved out of a single wafer, as shown in the ﬁgure. Additional “plumbing”and bearings are etched onto the wafers that are tosandwich the rotor. Combustion occurs just outside therotor, at the same wafer level, spinning it by pushing onits airfoils from the outside. At more than a million rpm, these turbines make no audible noise (it’s there, but noteven your dog can hear it)! Electricity will then be gen-erated using, for example, a tiny generator. The fuel source could be packaged with the engine or come as a replaceable cartridge like a cigarette lighter. In terms ofpower density, the little engine will easily beat batteries,with an output of somewhere between 50 and 100 watts! *Peerless Pump Company, a member of the Sterling Group, P.O.

Construct the velocity diagram for shockless ﬂow at the impeller inlet, if b5constant. Calculate the effective ﬂow angle with respect to the radial impeller blades for the case of no inlet swirl. Investigate the effects on ﬂow angle of (a) variations in impeller width and (b) inletswirl velocities. 10.13 For the impeller of Problem 10.5, determine the inlet blade angle for which the tangential component of the inletvelocity is zero if the volume ﬂow rate is 125,000 gpm.

The water enters axially, and leaves tangential to the impeller blades. The impeller exit diameter and width are 300 mm and 10 mm, respectively. If the pump requires 45 kW, and is 75 percent efﬁcient, estimate the exitangle of the impeller blades. 10.16 A centrifugal water pump designed to operate at 1200 rpm has dimensions Parameter Inlet Outlet Radius, r(mm) 90 150 Blade width, b(mm) 10 7.5 Blade angle, β(deg) 25 45 Determine the ﬂow rate at which the entering velocity has no tangential component.

Pumps, Fans, and Blowers 10.20 In the water pump of Problem 10.8, the pump casing acts as a diffuser, which converts 60 percent of the absolute velocity head at the impeller outlet to static pressure rise. Thehead loss through the pump suction and discharge channels is0.75 times the radial component of velocity head leaving the impeller. Estimate the volume ﬂow rate, head rise, power input, and pump efﬁciency at the maximum efﬁciency point.Assume the torque to overcome bearing, seal, and spin losses is 10 percent of the ideal torque at Q50.065 m 3/s. 10.21 The theoretical head delivered by a centrifugal pump at shutoff depends on the discharge radius and angular speed of the impeller. For preliminary design, it is useful to have a plot showing the theoretical shutoff characteristics and approximating the actual performance. Prepare a log-logplot of impeller radius versus theoretical head rise at shutoffwith standard motor speeds as parameters. Assume the ﬂuidis water and the actual head at the design ﬂow rate is 70 percent of the theoretical shutoff head. (Show these as dashed lines on the plot.)

Calculate (a) the propeller diameter, (b) the thrust produced at rest, and (c) the thrustproduced when the fanboat is moving ahead at 15 m/s if the mass ﬂow rate through the propeller remains constant. 10.105 A fanboat in the Florida Everglades is powered by a propeller, with D51:5 m, driven at maximum speed, N51800 rpm, by a 125 kW engine.

The rotor is designed to operate at a constant speed of 45 rpm in winds over 5 knots by controlling system load and adjusting blade angles.

The model, with D51 m, is to develop full power at V510 m =s wind speed. Calculate the angular speed of the model for optimum power generation. Estimate the power output. 10.114 A large Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine was built by the U.S. Department of Energy near Sandia, New Mexico [48]. This machine is 18 m tall and has a 5-m radius; the area swept by the rotor is over 110 m2. If the rotor is constrained to rotate at 70 rpm, plot the power this wind turbine can produce in kilowatts for wind speeds between 5 and 50 knots. 10.115 Lift and drag data for the NACA 23015 airfoil section are presented in Fig. 9.17.

Compressible-Flow Turbomachines 10.117 A prototype air compressor with a compression ratio of 7 is designed to take 8.9 kg/s air at 1 atmosphere and 20/C14C. The design point speed, power requirement, and efﬁciency are 600 rpm, 5.6 MW, and 80 percent, respectively. A 1:5- scale model of the prototype is built to help determineoperability for the prototype. If the model takes in air at identical conditions to the prototype design point, what will the mass ﬂow and power requirement be for operation at80 percent efﬁciency? 10.118 A compressor has been designed for entrance con- ditions of 14.7 psia and 70/C14F. To economize on the power required, it is being tested with a throttle in the entry duct toreduce the entry pressure. The characteristic curve for its normal design speed of 3200 rpm is being obtained on a day when the ambient temperature is 58 /C14F. At what speed should the compressor be run? At the point on the characteristiccurve at which the mass ﬂow would normally be 125 lbm/s, the entry pressure is 8.0 psia. Calculate the actual mass ﬂow rate during the test. 10.119 The turbine for a new jet engine was designed for entrance conditions of 160 psia and 1700/C14F, ingesting 500 lbm/s at a speed of 500 rpm, and exit conditions of80 psia and 1350 /C14F. If the altitude and fueling for the engine were changed such that the entrance conditions were now 140 psia and 1600/C14F, calculate the new operating speed, mass ﬂow rate, and exit conditions for similar operation, i.e., equal efﬁciency. 10.120 We have seen many examples in Chapter 7 of replacing working ﬂuids in order to more easily achievesimilitude between models and prototypes.

Batteries are energy storage devicesthat allow us to generate energy at one time and placeand store it for use at a different time and in anotherplace. The ﬁgure shows a rather mundane-lookingdam (it’s the Ffestiniog Dam in north Wales), but it’sactually part of a pretty exciting development, theFfestiniog Pumped Storage Scheme: it’s a battery! The idea of using reservoirs not only as a source of power but as a way to store power is not new; effortswere made in the 19th century. But it is becoming veryimportant in optimizing power plant performance, aswell as in storing renewable energy generated by wind, 600In this chapter we introduce some of the basic concepts in the study of open-channel ﬂows. The topic of open-channel ﬂow is covered in much more detail in a number ofspecialized texts [1 /C08]. Many ﬂows in engineering and in nature occur with a free surface. An example of a human-made channel is shown in Fig. 11.1. This is a view of the 190-mile-long Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct, which is part of the Central Arizona Project (CAP). TheCAP is a 336-mi (541 km) diversion canal in Arizona used to redirect water fromwave, and ocean current farms, some of which we have reviewed in previous Case Studies in Energy and the Environment . Power companies have always had the problem that energy demand tends to have severe peaks and troughs; in the afternoon and evening thereis high demand; in the middle of the night, lowdemand. However, for best efﬁciency, plants shouldoperate at a steady energy output; in addition, thepower company needs to have on hand extra power generation capability just for those peaks. On the other hand, renewable energy needs to be harvested whenit’s available—when the wind is blowing, when thereare waves or decent currents ﬂowing—and these timesdo not always correspond to the times when theenergy is needed. With schemes like the one at Ffes-tiniog, at times of low electrical demand, excess gen-eration capacity from the power company is used to pump water into an upper reservoir; when there is high demand, water is released back into a lower reservoirthrough a turbine, generating electricity. Reversibleturbine/generator assemblies act as pump and turbine(usually of a Francis turbine design; see Chapter 10).The system’s four water turbines can generate 360 MW of electricity within a minute of the need arising! Some facilities worldwide are purely pumped- storage plants, which simply shift water between two reservoirs, but combined pump-storage plants thatalso generate their own electricity like conventionalhydroelectric plants are becoming more common. Theprocess is reasonably efﬁcient and is the only way thathuge amounts of energy can be stored (electric bat- teries are all relatively low capacity). Taking into account losses in the turbine/generator system andfrom evaporation loss at the exposed water surface, aswell as the possibility of losses due to hydraulic jumps(discussed in this chapter) occurring at outlets, about70 to 85 percent of the electrical energy used to pumpthe water into the elevated reservoir can be regained.In future years, increased effort will be placed on increasing the efﬁciency of these systems, and they will become much more common. The Ffestiniog sys-tem is for storing excess power plant energy, but inthe future we may expect to see pumped-storageplants adjacent to a number of wind farms.

[Courtesy of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (1985), photograph by Joe Madrigal Jr.]602 Chapter 11Flow in Open Channelsthe Colorado River into central and southern Arizona, and it is the largest and most expensive aqueduct system ever constructed in the United States. Because free surface ﬂows differ in several important respects from the ﬂows in closed conduits that we reviewed in Chapter 8, we treat them separately in thischapter. Familiar examples where the free surface is at atmospheric pressure includeﬂows in rivers, aqueducts, and irrigation canals, ﬂows in rooftop or street gutters, anddrainage ditches. Human-made channels are given many different names, includingcanal, ﬂume, or culvert. A canal usually is excavated below ground level and may be unlined or lined. Canals generally are long and of very mild slope; they are used tocarry irrigation or storm water or for navigation. A ﬂume usually is built above ground level to carry water across a depression. A culvert, which usually is designed to ﬂow only part-full, is a short covered channel used to drain water under a highway orrailroad embankment. In this chapter we shall develop, using control volume concepts from Chapter 4, some basic theory for describing the behavior and classiﬁcation of ﬂows in natural andhuman-made channels. We shall consider: /C15Flows for which the local effects of area change predominate and frictional forcesmay be neglected. An example is ﬂow over a bump or depression, over the short length of which friction is negligible. /C15Flow with an abrupt change in depth . This occurs during a hydraulic jump (see Fig. 11.12 for examples of hydraulic jumps). /C15Flow at what is called normal depth . For this, the ﬂow cross section does not vary in the ﬂow direction; the liquid surface is parallel to the channel bed. This is analogousto fully developed ﬂow in a pipe. /C15Gradually varied ﬂow . An example is ﬂow in a channel in which the bed slope varies. The major objective in the analysis of gradually varied ﬂow is to predict theshape of the free surface. It is quite common to observe surface waves in ﬂows with a free surface, the simplestexample being when an object such as a pebble is thrown into the water. The prop-agation speed of a surface wave is analogous in many respects to the propagation of asound wave in a compressible ﬂuid medium (which we discuss in Chapter 12). Weshall determine the factors that affect the speed of such surface waves. We will seethat this is an important determinant in whether an open-channel ﬂow is able togradually adjust to changing conditions downstream or a hydraulic jump occurs. This chapter also includes a brief discussion of ﬂow measurement techniques for use in open channels. 11.1 Basic Concepts and De ﬁnitions Before analyzing the different types of ﬂows that may occur in an open channel, wewill discuss some common concepts and sta te some simplifying assumptions. We are doing so explicitly, because there are some important differences between ourprevious studies of pipes and ducts in Chapter 8 and the study of open-channelﬂows. One signiﬁcant difference between ﬂows in pipes and ducts is /C15The driving force for open-channel ﬂows is gravity . (Note that some ﬂows in pipes and ducts are also gravity driven (for example, ﬂowdown a full drainpipe), but typically ﬂow is driven by a pressure difference generatedby a device such as a pump.) The gravity force in open-channel ﬂow is opposed byfriction force on the solid boundaries of the channel.11.1 Basic Concepts and Deﬁnitions 603Simplifying Assumptions The ﬂow in an open channel, especially in a natural one such as a river, is often very complex, three-dimensional, and unsteady. However, in most cases, we can obtain useful results by approximating such ﬂows as being: /C15One-dimensional . /C15Steady . A third simplifying assumption is: /C15The ﬂow at each section in an open-channel ﬂow is approximated as a uniform velocity . Typical contours of actual streamwise velocity for a number of open-channel sections are shown in Fig. 11.2. These would seem to indicate that the third assumption is invalid, but in fact it is a reasonable approximation, as we shall now justify. Most ﬂowsof interest are large in physical scale, so the Reynolds numbers generally are large.Consequently, open-channel ﬂow seldom is laminar; in this chapter we will assume turbulent ﬂow. As we saw in earlier chapters, turbulence tends to smooth out the velocity gradient (see Fig. 8.11 for turbulent pipe ﬂow and Fig. 9.7 afor turbulent boundary layers). Hence although the proﬁles, as shown in Fig. 11.2, are notuniform, as a reasonable approximation we will assume uniform velocity at each section, withthe kinetic energy coefﬁcient, α, taken to be unity (the kinetic energy coefﬁcient is discussed in Section 8.6). This is illustrated in Fig. 11.3a. Figure 11.2 shows that the measured maximum velocity occurs below the free surface, in spite of the fact that there is negligible shear stress due to air drag so one would expect the maximum velocity to occur at the free surface. Secondary ﬂows are also responsible for distorting the axial velocity proﬁle; examples of secondaryﬂows are when a channel has a bend or curve or has an obstruction, such as a bridgepier. The high velocities that may be present in the vortices generated in such casescan seriously erode the bottom of a natural channel. VIDEO A Turbulent Channel (Animation).

(From Chow [1], used by permission.)604 Chapter 11Flow in Open ChannelsThe next simplifying assumption we make is: /C15The pressure distribution is approximated as hydrostatic . This is illustrated in Fig. 11.3band is a signiﬁcant difference from the analysis of ﬂows in pipes and ducts of Chapter 8; for these we found that the pressure was uniform at each axial location and varied in the streamwise direction. In open-channel ﬂows, thefree surface will be at atmospheric pressure (zero gage), so the pressure at the surface does not vary in the direction of ﬂow. The major pressure variation occurs across each section; this will be exactly true if streamline curvature effects are negligible, which is often the case. As in the case of turbulent ﬂow in pipes, we must rely on empirical correlations to relate frictional effects to the average velocity of ﬂow. The empirical correlation is included through a head loss term in the energy equation (Section 11.2). Additional complications in many practical cases include the presence of sediment or other particulate matter in theﬂow, as well as the erosion of earthen channels or structures by water action. Channel Geometry Channels may be constructed in a variety of cross-sectional shapes; in many casesregular geometric shapes are used. A channel with a constant slope and cross section is termed prismatic . Lined canals often are built with rectangular or trapezoidal sec- tions; smaller troughs or ditches sometimes are triangular. Culverts and tunnels generally are circular or elliptical in section. Natural channels are highly irregular andnonprismatic, but often they are approximated using trapezoid or paraboloid sections.Geometric properties of common open-channel shapes are summarized in Table 11.1. Thedepth of ﬂow ,y, is the perpendicular distance measured from the channel bed to the free surface. The ﬂow area, A, is the cross section of the ﬂow perpendicular to the ﬂow direction. The wetted perimeter ,P, is the length of the solid channel cross- section surface in contact with the liquid. The hydraulic radius ,R h, is deﬁned as Rh5A Pð11:1Þ For ﬂow in noncircular closed conduits (Section 8.7), the hydraulic diameter wasdeﬁned as D h54A Pð8:50Þ Thus, for a circular pipe, the hydraulic diameter, from Eq. 8.50, is equal to the pipediameter. From Eq. 11.1, the hydraulic radius for a circular pipe would then be half the actual pipe radius, which is a bit confusing! The hydraulic radius, as deﬁned byEq. 11.1, is commonly used in the analysis of open-channel ﬂows, so it will be usedV (a) Approximate velocity profile (b) Approximate pressure distribution (gage) Fig. 11.3 Approximations for velocity proﬁle and pressure distribution.11.1 Basic Concepts and Deﬁnitions 605throughout this chapter. One reason for this usage is that the hydraulic radius of a wide channel, as seen in Table 11.1, is equal to the actual depth. For nonrectangular channels, the hydraulic depth is deﬁned as yh5A bsð11:2Þ where bsis the width at the surface. Hence the hydraulic depth represents the average depth of the channel at any cross section. It gives the depth of an equivalent rectan- gular channel. Speed of Surface Waves and the Froude Number We will learn later in this chapter that the behavior of an open-channel ﬂow as it encounters downstream changes (for example, a bump of the bed surface, a narrowing of the channel, or a change in slope) is strongly dependent on whether the ﬂow is “slow” orTable 11.1 Geometric Properties of Common Open-Channel Shapes Shape Trapezoidal Triangular Rectangular Wide Flat CircularSectionFlow Area, AWetted Perimeter, PHydraulic Radius, R h y(b /H11001 y cot α) (α/H11002sinα)8y2 cot α D2by b/H110012y by by cos αy(b /H11001 y cot α)b /H110012y sinα 2y sinα 2 by b/H110012yb /H110012y sinα y 2αD 41/H11002D sinα αbs bs bsαα b b yyyy yα Db>>y606 Chapter 11Flow in Open Channels“fast.” A slow ﬂow will have time to gradually adjust to changes downstream, whereas a fast ﬂow will also sometimes gradually adjust but in some situations will do so“violently” (i.e., there will be a hydraulic jump; see Fig. 11.12 afor an example). The question is what constitutes a slow or fast ﬂow? These vague descriptions will bemade more precise now. It turns out that the speed at which surface waves travel alongthe surface is key to deﬁning more precisely the notions of slow and fast. To determine the speed (or celerity ) of surface waves, consider an open channel with movable end wall, containing a liquid initially at rest. If the end wall is given asudden motion, as in Fig. 11.4a, a wave forms and travels down the channel at some speed, c(we assume a rectangular channel of width, b, for simplicity). If we shift coordinates so that we are traveling with the wave speed, c, we obtain a steady control volume, as shown in Fig. 11.4b(where for now we assume c.ΔV). To obtain an expression for c, we will use the continuity and momentum equations for this control volume. We also have the following assumptions: 1.Steady ﬂow. 2.Incompressible ﬂow. 3.Uniform velocity at each section. 4.Hydrostatic pressure distribution at each section. 5.Frictionless ﬂow. Assumption 1is valid for the control volume in shifted coordinates. Assumption 2is obviously valid for our liquid ﬂow. Assumptions 3and 4are used for the entire chapter. Assumption 5is valid in this case because we assume the area on which it acts, bΔx, is relatively small (the sketch is not to scale), so the total friction force is negligible. For an incompressible ﬂow with uniform velocity at each section, we can use the appropriate form of continuity from Chapter 4, X CS~V/C1~A50 ð4:13bÞ Applying Eq. 4.13b to the control volume, we obtain ðc2ΔVÞfðy1ΔyÞbg2cyb50 ð11:3Þ or cy2ΔVy1cΔy2ΔVΔy2cy50 Solving for ΔV, ΔV5cΔy y1Δyð11:4Þ ΔV (a) Absolute coordinatesFluid moving at speed ΔVFluid at restFluid moving at speed (c –ΔV)Wave at restWave moving at speed c (b) Coordinates at rest relative to waveFluid moving at speed cControl volume xyΔy yy + Δy y Δx Fig. 11.4 Motion of a surface wave.11.1 Basic Concepts and Deﬁnitions 607For the momentum equation, again with the assumption of uniform velocity at each section, we can use the following form of the xcomponent of momentum Fx5FSx1FBx5@ @tZ CVuρdV---1X CSuρ~V/C1~A ð4:18dÞ The unsteady term @/@tdisappears as the ﬂow is steady , and the body force FBxis zero forhorizontal ﬂow .

We recall from our study of hydrostatics that the hydrostatic force F Ron a submerged vertical surface of area Ais given by the simple result FR5pcA ð3:10bÞ where pcis the pressure at the centroid of the vertical surface.

For example, it explains why waves “crash” as they approach the beach. Out to sea, thewater depths below wave crests and troughs are approximately the same, and hence soare their speeds. As the water depth decreases on the approach to the beach, the depth of crests start to become signiﬁcantly larger than trough depths, causing crests to speed up and overtake the troughs. Note that ﬂuid properties do not enter into the speed: Viscosity is usually a minor factor, and it turns out that the disturbance or wave we have described is due to theinteraction of gravitational and inertia forces, both of which are linear with density.Equation 11.6 was derived on the basis of one-dimensional motion ( xdirection); a more realistic model allowing two-dimensional ﬂuid motion ( xandydirections) shows that Eq. 11.6 applies for the limiting case of large wavelength waves (Problem 11.6 explores this). Also, there are other types of surface waves, such as capillary waves driven by surface tension, for which Eq. 11.6 does not apply (Problems 11.7 and 11.8explore surface tension effects). Example 11.1 SPEED OF FREE SURFACE WAVES You are enjoying a summer’s afternoon relaxing in a rowboat on a pond. You decide to ﬁnd out how deep the wateris by splashing your oar and timing how long it takes the wave you produce to reach the edge of the pond. (The pondis artiﬁcial; so it has approximately the same depth even to the shore.) From ﬂoats installed in the pond, you knowyou’re 20 ft from shore, and you measure the time for the wave to reach the edge to be 1.5 s. Estimate the ponddepth.

(The disturbance could be caused by a bump in the channelﬂoor or by a barrier, for example.) The disturbance will travel upstream at speed c relative to the ﬂuid . If the ﬂuid speed is slow, V,c, and the disturbance will travel upstream at absolute speed ( c/C0V). However, if the ﬂuid speed is fast, V.c, and the disturbance cannot travel upstream and instead is washed downstream at absolute speed(V/C0c). This leads to radically different responses of slow and fast ﬂows to a downstream disturbance. Hence, recalling Eq. 11.6 for the speed c, open-channel ﬂows may be classiﬁed on the basis of Froude number ﬁrst introduced in Chapter 7: Fr5Vﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃgyp ð11:7Þ Instead of the rather loose terms “slow” and “fast,” we now have the following criteria: Fr,1Flow is subcritical ,tranquil ,o rstreaming . Disturbances can travel upstream; downstream conditions can affect the ﬂow upstream. The ﬂow can gradually adjust to the disturbance. Fr=1Flow is critical . Fr.1Flow is supercritical ,rapid ,o rshooting . No disturbance can travel upstream; downstream conditions cannot be felt upstream. The ﬂow may “violently”respond to the disturbance because the ﬂow has no chance to adjust to thedisturbance before encountering it. Note that for nonrectangular channels we use the hydraulic depth y h, Fr5Vﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃgyhp ð11:8Þ These regimes of ﬂow behavior are qualitatively analogous to the subsonic, sonic, and supersonic regimes of gas ﬂow that we will discuss in Chapter 12. (In that case we arealso comparing a ﬂow speed, V, to the speed of a wave, c, except that the wave is a sound wave rather than a surface wave.) We will discuss the ramiﬁcations of these various Froude number regimes later in this chapter. 11.2 Energy Equation for Open-Channel Flows In analyzing open-channel ﬂows, we will use the continuity, momentum, and energy equations. Here we derive the appropriate form of the energy equation (we will use continuity and momentum when needed). As in the case of pipe ﬂow, friction in open-channel ﬂows results in a loss of mechanical energy; this can be characterized by ahead loss. The temptation is to just use one of the forms of the energy equation forpipe ﬂow we derived in Section 8.6, such as p1 ρg1α1V2 2 2g1z1 ! 2p2 ρg1α2V22 2g1z2 ! 5hlT g5HlTð8:30Þ The problem with this is that it was derived on the assumption of uniform pressure at each section, which is not the case in open-channel ﬂow (we have a hydrostatic610 Chapter 11Flow in Open Channelspressure variation at each location); we do not have a uniform p1at section 1and uniform p2at section 2! Instead we need to derive an energy equation for open-channel ﬂows from ﬁrst principles. We will closely follow the steps outlined in Section 8.6 for pipe ﬂows but use different assumptions. You are urged to review Section 8.6 in order to be aware ofthe similarities and differences between pipe ﬂows and open-channel ﬂows. We will use the generic control volume shown in Fig. 11.5, with the following assumptions: 1.Steady ﬂow 2.Incompressible ﬂow 3.Uniform velocity at a section 4.Gradually varying depth so that pressure distribution is hydrostatic 5.Small bed slope _W s5 _Wshear5 _Wother50 We make a few comments here. We have seen assumptions 1/C04already; they will always apply in this chapter. Assumption 5simpliﬁes the analysis so that depth, y, is taken to be vertical and speed, V, is taken to be horizontal, rather than normal and parallel to the bed, respectively. Assumption 6states that there is no shaft work, no work due to ﬂuid shearing at the boundaries, and no other work. There is no shear work at the boundaries because on each part of the control surface the tangential velocity is zero (on the channelwalls) or the shear stress is zero (the open surface), so no work can be done. Note thatthere can still be mechanical energy dissipation within the ﬂuid due to friction. We have chosen a generic control volume so that we can derive a generic energy equation for open-channel ﬂows, that is, an equation that can be applied to a varietyof ﬂows such as ones with a variation in elevation, or a hydraulic jump, or a sluice gate,and so on, between sections 1and 2. Coordinate zindicates distances measured in the vertical direction; distances measured vertically from the channel bed are denotedbyy. Note that y 1andy2are the ﬂow depths at sections 1and 2, respectively, and z1 andz2are the corresponding channel elevations. The energy equation for a control volume is Q /H11002 W s /H11002 W shear /H11002 W other /H11005 /H11005 0(6) /H11005 0(6) /H11005 0(6) /H11005 0(1) t CVe dV /H11001 /H11001/H11001CS(e /H11001 pυ) V V2 2dA /H9267/H9267/H20885/H20885.. . . e /H11005 u(4.56) · gz Control volume z1/onesans y1 y z2/twosans y2 z Fig. 11.5 Control volume and coordinates for energy analysis of open-channel ﬂow.11.2 Energy Equation for Open-Channel Flows 611Recall that uis the thermal speciﬁc energy and v=1 /ρis the speciﬁc volume. After using assumptions 1and 6, and rearranging, with _m5R ρ~V/C1d~A, and dA=bdywhere b(y) is the channel width, we obtain _Q52Z 1p ρ1V2 21gz0 @1AρVbdy2Z 1uρVbdy1Z 2p ρ1V2 21gz0@1AρVbdy1Z 2uρVbdy 5Z 1p ρ1V2 21gz0@1AρVbdy1Z 2p ρ1V2 21gz0@1AρVbdy1 _mðu 22u1Þ or Z 1p ρ1V2 21gz/C18/C19 ρVbdy2Z 2p ρ1V2 21gz/C18/C19 ρVbdy5 _mðu22u1Þ2 _Q5 _mhlT ð11:9Þ This states that the loss in mechanical energies (“pressure,” kinetic and potential) through the control volume leads to a gain in the thermal energy and/or a loss of heatfrom the control volume. As in Section 8.6, these thermal effects are collected into thehead loss term h lT. The surface integrals in Eq. 11.9 can be simpliﬁed. The speed, V, is constant at each section by assumption 3. The pressure, p, does vary across sections 1and 2, as does the potential, z. However, by assumption 4, the pressure variation is hydrostatic. Hence, for section 1, using the notation of Fig. 11.5 p5ρgðy12yÞ [sop=ρgy1at the bed and p= 0 (gage) at the free surface] and z5ðz11yÞ Conveniently, we see that the pressure decreases linearly with ywhile z increases linearly with y, so the two terms together are constant, p ρ1gz/C18/C19 15gðy12yÞ1gðz11yÞ5gðy11z1Þ Using these results in the ﬁrst integral in Eq. 11.9, Z 1p ρ1V2 21gz/C18/C19 ρVbdy5Z 1V2 21gðy11z1Þ/C18/C19 ρVbdy5V2 1 21gy11gz1/C18/C19 _m We ﬁnd a similar result for section 2, so Eq. 11.9 becomes V2 2 21gy21gz2/C18/C19 2V2 1 21gy11gz1/C18/C19 5hlT Finally, dividing by g(with Hl5hlT=g) leads to an energy equation for open-channel ﬂow V2 1 2g1y11z15V2 2 2g1y21z21Hl ð11:10Þ This can be compared to the corresponding equation for pipe ﬂow, Eq. 8.30, presentedat the beginning of this section. (Note that we H luse rather than HlT; in pipe ﬂow we can have major and minor losses, justifying Tfor total, but in open-channel ﬂow we do612 Chapter 11Flow in Open Channelsnot make this distinction.) Equation 11.10 will prove useful to us for the remainder of the chapter and indicates that energy computations can be done simply from geometry(yandz) and velocity, V. Thetotal head orenergy head ,H, at any location in an open-channel ﬂow can be deﬁned from Eq. 11.10 as H5V2 2g1y1z ð11:11Þ where yandzare the local ﬂow depth andchannel bed elevation, respectively (they no longer represent the coordinates shown in Fig. 11.5). This is a measure of the mechanical energy (kinetic and pressure/potential) of the ﬂow. Using this in theenergy equation, we obtain an alternative form H 12H25Hl ð11:12Þ From this we see that the loss of total head depends on head loss due to friction. Speciﬁc Energy We can also deﬁne the speciﬁc energy (orspeciﬁc head ), denoted by the symbol E, E5V2 2g1y ð11:13Þ This is a measure of the mechanical energy (kinetic and pressure/potential) of the ﬂow above and beyond that due to channel bed elevation; it essentially indicates the energy due to the ﬂow’s speed and depth . Using Eq. 11.13 in Eq. 11.10, we obtain another form of the energy equation, E12E21z12z25Hl ð11:14Þ From this we see that the change in speciﬁc energy depends on friction and on channel elevation change. While the total head must decrease in the direction of ﬂow (Eq. 11.12), the speciﬁc head may decrease, increase, or remain constant, depending on thebed elevation, z. From continuity, V=Q/A, so the speciﬁc energy can be written E5Q2 2gA21y ð11:15Þ For all channels Ais a monotonically increasing function of ﬂow depth (as Table 11.1 indicates); increasing the depth must lead to a larger ﬂow area. Hence, Eq. 11.15indicates that the speciﬁc energy is a combination of a hyperbolic-type decrease withdepth and a linear increase with depth. This is illustrated in Fig. 11.6. We see that fora given ﬂow rate, Q, there is a range of possible ﬂow depths and energies, but one depth at which the speciﬁc energy is at a minimum. Instead of Eversus ywe typically plotyversus Eso that the plot corresponds to the example ﬂow section, as shown in Fig. 11.7. Recalling that the speciﬁc energy, E, indicates actual energy (kinetic plus potential/ pressure per unit mass ﬂow rate) being carried by the ﬂow, we see that a given ﬂow, Q, can have a range of energies, E, and corresponding ﬂow depths, y. Figure 11.7 also reveals some interesting ﬂow phenomena. For a given ﬂow, Q, and speciﬁc energy, E, there are two possible ﬂow depths, y; these are called alternate depths . For example,11.2 Energy Equation for Open-Channel Flows 613we can have a ﬂow at depth y1or depth y2. The ﬁrst ﬂow has large depth and is moving slowly, and the second ﬂow is shallow but fast moving. The plot graphically indicates this: For the ﬁrst ﬂow, E1is made up of a large y1and small V2 1=2g; for the second ﬂow, E2is made up of a small y2and large V2 2=2g. We will see later that we can switch from one ﬂow to another. We can also see (as we will demonstrate in Example 11.2 for a rectangular channel) that for a given Q, there is always one ﬂow for which the speciﬁc energy is minimum, E=Emin; we will investigate this further after Example 11.2 and show that Emin=Ecrit, where Ecritis the speciﬁc energy at critical conditions.E y2gA2Q2y Fig. 11.6 Dependence of speciﬁc energy on ﬂow depth for a given ﬂow rate.

However, it turns out that for any given cross section we can write dA5bsdy ð11:17Þ where, as we saw earlier, bsis the width at the surface. This is indicated in Fig. 11.8; the incremental increase in area dAdue to incremental depth change dyoccurs at the free surface, where b=bs.

Equation 11.21 can be used to ﬁnd the critical depth, yc, for a given channel cross-section shape, at a given ﬂow rate. The equation is deceptively difﬁcult: Acandbsceach depend on ﬂow depth y, often in a nonlinear fashion; so it must usually be iteratively solved for y. Once ycis obtained, area, Ac, and surface width, bsc, can be computed, leading to yhc(using Eq. 11.2). This in turn is used in Eq. 11.22 to ﬁnd the ﬂow speed Vc(orVc=Q/Accan be used).

The critical state is an important benchmark. It will be used in the next section to help determine what happens when aﬂow encounters an obstacle such as a bump. Also, near the minimum E, as Fig. 11.7 shows, the rate of change of ywith Eis nearly inﬁnite. This means that for critical ﬂow conditions, even small changes in E, due to channel irregularities or disturbances, can cause pronounced changes in ﬂuid depth. Thus, surface waves, usually in an unstablemanner, form when a ﬂow is near critical conditions. Long runs of near-critical ﬂowconsequently are avoided in practice.

Flow over a Bump Consider frictionless ﬂow in a horizontal rectangular channel of constant width, b, with a bump in the channel bed, as illustrated in Fig. 11.9. (We choose a rectangular channel for simplicity, but the results we obtain will apply generally.) The bumpheight above the horizontal bed of the channel is z=h(x); the water depth, y(x), is measured from the local channel bottom surface. Note that we have indicated two possibilities for the free surface behavior: Perhaps the ﬂow gradually rises over the bump; perhaps it gradually dips over the bump. (There are other possibilities too!) One thing we can be sure of, however, is that if it rises, it will not have the same contour as the bump. (Can you explain why?)

Fr,1Flow is subcritical ,tranquil ,o rstreaming . When Fr,1, (Fr2/C01),1 and the slope dy/dxof the free surface has the opposite sign to the slope dh/dxof the bump: When the bump elevation increases, the ﬂow dips; when the bumpelevation decreases, the ﬂow depth increases. This is the solid free surfaceshown in Fig. 11.9. F r51Flow is critical . When Fr51, (Fr2/C01)50. Eq. 11.30 predicts an inﬁnite water surface slope, unless dh/dxequals zero at this instant. Since the free surface slope cannot be inﬁnite, then dh/dxmust be zero when Fr= 1; put another way, if we have Fr= 1 (we don’t have to have Fr= 1 in a ﬂow), it can only be at a location where dh/dx= 0 (at the crest of the bump, or where the channel is ﬂat). If critical ﬂow isattained, then downstream of the critical ﬂow location the ﬂow may be subcritical or supercritical, depending on downstream conditions. Ifcritical ﬂow does notoccur where dh/dx= 0, then ﬂow downstream from this location will be the same type as the ﬂow upstream from the location. F r.1Flow is supercritical ,rapid ,o rshooting .W h e nFr .1, (Fr2/C01).1 and the slope dy/dxof the free surface has the same sign as the slope dh/dxof the bump: when the bump elevation increases, so does the ﬂow depth; when thebump elevation decreases, so does the ﬂow depth. This is the dashed freesurface shown in Fig. 11.9. The general trends for Fr,1 and Fr.1, for either an increasing or decreasing bed elevation, are illustrated in Fig. 11.10. The important point about critical ﬂow ( Fr=1 ) is that, if it does occur, it can do so only where the bed elevation is constant. An additional visual aid is provided by the speciﬁc energy graph of Fig. 11.11. This shows the speciﬁc energy curve for a given ﬂow rate, Q. For a subcritical ﬂow that is at state abefore it encounters a bump, as the ﬂow moves up the bump toward the bump peak, the speciﬁc energy must decrease (Eq. 11.28). Hence wemove along the curve to point b. If point bcorresponds to the bump peak, then we move back along the curve to a(note that this frictionless ﬂow is reversible!) as the ﬂow descends the bump. Alternatively, if the bump continues to increasebeyond point b,w ec o n t i n u et om o v ea l o n gt h ec u r v et ot h em i n i m u me n e r g y point, point ewhere E=E min=Ecrit. As we have discussed, for frictionless ﬂow to exist, point ecan only be where dh/dx= 0 (the bump peak). For this case, some- thing interesting happens as the ﬂow descends down the bump: We can returnalong the curve to point a, or we can move along the curve to point d. This means that the surface of a subcritical ﬂow that encounters a bump will dip and then either return to its original depth or(if the bump is high enough for the ﬂow to reach critical conditions) may continue to accelerate and become shallower until itreaches the supercritical state correspond ing to the original speciﬁc energy (point d). Which trend occurs depends on downstream conditions; for example, if there is11.3 Localized Effect of Area Change (Frictionless Flow) 621some type of ﬂow restriction, the ﬂow downstream of the bump will return to its original subcritical state. Note that a s we mentioned earlier, when a ﬂow is at the critical state the surface behavior tends to display dramatic variations in behavior.Finally, Fig. 11.11 indicates that a supercritical ﬂow (point d) that encounters a bump would increase in depth over the bump (to point cat the bump peak), and then return to its supercritical ﬂow at point d. We also see that if the bump is high enough a supercritical ﬂow could slow down to critical (point e) and then either return to supercritical (point d) or become subcritical (point a). Which of these possibilities actually occurs obviously depends on the bump shape, but also on upstream anddownstream conditions (the last possibility is somewhat unlikely to occur in prac-tice). The alert reader may ask, “What ha ppens if the bump is so big that the speciﬁc energy wants to decrease below the minimum shown at point e? ”T h ea n s w e ri st h a t the ﬂow will no longer conform to Eq. 11.26; the ﬂow will no longer be frictionless,because a hydraulic jump will occur, consuming a signiﬁcant amount of mechanicalenergy (see Section 11.4).y Ea b c de (E = Emin) Fig. 11.11 Speciﬁc energy curve for ﬂow over a bump.Flow regime> 0 Flow Subcritical Fr < 1 Supercritical Fr > 1dh dx Flow< 0dy dx > 0dh dx> 0dyy h dx< 0dh dx> 0dy dx < 0dh dx< 0dy dx FlowFlow Fig. 11.10 Effects of bed elevation changes.622 Chapter 11Flow in Open ChannelsExample 11.4 FLOW IN A RECTANGULAR CHANNEL WITH A BUMP OR A NARROWING A rectangular channel 2 m wide has a ﬂow of 2.4 m3/s at a depth of 1.0 m.

Neglect head losses of the bump and constriction caused by friction, expansion, and contraction. Given: Rectangular channel with a bump, a side wall constriction, or both.

The fact that we must have a speciﬁc energy that is less than the minimum allowable means something has to give! Whathappens is that the ﬂow assumptions become invalid; the ﬂow may nolonger be uniform or one-dimensional, or there may be a signiﬁcant energyloss, for example due to a hydraulic jump occurring. (We will discusshydraulic jumps in the next section.) Hence the bump and constriction together aresufﬁcient to make the ﬂow reach critical state. ßThisExampleillustrateshow todeter-minewhetherachannelbumporconstriction, orboth,leadtocriticalﬂow conditions.624 Chapter 11Flow in Open Channels11.4 The Hydraulic Jump We have shown that open-channel ﬂow may be subcritical ( Fr,1) or supercritical (Fr.1). For subcritical ﬂow, disturbances caused by a change in bed slope or ﬂow cross section may move upstream and downstream; the result is a smooth adjustment of the ﬂow, as we have seen in the previous section. When ﬂow at a section issupercritical, and downstream conditions will require a change to subcritical ﬂow, theneed for this change cannot be communicated upstream; the ﬂow speed exceedsthe speed of surface waves, which are the mechanism for transmitting changes. Thus agradual change with a smooth transition through the critical point is not possible. Thetransition from supercritical to subcritical ﬂow occurs abruptly through a hydraulic jump . Hydraulic jumps can occur in canals downstream of regulating sluices, at the foot of spillways (see Fig. 11.12 a), where a steep channel slope suddenly becomes ﬂat—and even in the home kitchen (see Fig. 11.12 b)! The speciﬁc energy curve and general shape of a jump are shown in Fig. 11.13. We will see in this section that thejump always goes from a supercritical depth ( y 1,yc) to a subcritical depth ( y2.yc) and that there will be a drop ΔEin the speciﬁc energy. Unlike the changes due to phenomena such as a bump, the abrupt change in depth involves a signiﬁcant loss ofmechanical energy through turbulent mixing. The control volume for a hydraulic jump is sketched in Fig. 11.14. We shall analyze the jump phenomenon by applying the basic equations to the control volume shown in the sketch. Experiments show that the jump occurs over arelatively short distance—at most, approximately six times the larger depth ( y 2) [9]. In view of this short length, it is reasonable to assume that friction force Ffacting on the control volume is negligible compared to pressure forces. Note that we are thereforeignoring viscous effects for momentum considerations, but notfor energy considera- tions (as we just mentioned, there is considerable turbulence in the jump). Although hydraulic jumps can occur on inclined surfaces, for simplicity we assume a horizontal bed, and rectangular channel of width b; the results we obtain will apply generally to hydraulic jumps. Hence we have the following assumptions: 1.Steady ﬂow 2.Incompressible ﬂow 3.Uniform velocity at each section (a) The Burdekin dam in Australia (b) The Kitchen Sink (James Kilfiger) Fig. 11.12 Examples of a hydraulic jump. VIDEO A Laminar Hydraulic Jump. 11.4 The Hydraulic Jump 6254.Hydrostatic pressure distribution at each section 5.Frictionless ﬂow (for the momentum equation) These assumptions are familiar from previous discussions in this chapter.

By assumption 5we neglect friction. The gage pressure at the two ends is hydrostatic, as illustrated in Fig. 11.3 b. We recall from our study of hydrostatics that the hydrostatic force, FR, on a submerged vertical surface of area, A, is given by the simple result FR5pcA ð3:10bÞ where pcis the pressure at the centroid of the vertical surface.

Depth Increase Across a Hydraulic Jump To ﬁnd the downstream or, as it is called, the sequent depth in terms of conditions upstream from the hydraulic jump, we begin by eliminating V2from the momentum equation. From continuity, V2=V1y1/y2(Eq. 11.31), so Eq. 11.33 can be written V2 1y1 g1y2 1 25V2 1y1 gy1 y2/C18/C19 1y2 2 2 Rearranging y2 22y2152V2 1y1 g12y1 y2/C18/C19 52V2 1y1 gy22y1 y2/C18/C1911.4 The Hydraulic Jump 627Dividing both sides by the common factor ( y2/C0y1), we obtain y21y152V2 1y1 gy2 Next, multiplying by y2and dividing by y2 1gives y2 y1/C18/C192 1y2 y1/C18/C19 52V2 1 gy152Fr2 1 ð11:35Þ Solving for y2/y1using the quadratic formula (ignoring the physically meaningless negative root), we obtain y2 y151 2ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 118Fr2 1q 21/C20/C21 ð11:36Þ Hence, the ratio of downstream to upstream depths across a hydraulic jump is only a function of the upstream Froude number. Equation 11.36 has been experimentally well veriﬁed, as can be seen in Fig. 11.15 a.D e p t h s y1andy2are referred to as conjugate depths . From Eq. 11.35, we see that an increase in depth ( y2.y1) requires an upstream Froude number greater than one ( Fr1.1). We have not yet established that we must have Fr1.1, just that it must be for an increase in depth (theoretically we could have Fr1,1a n d y2,y1); we will now consider the head loss to demonstrate that we must have Fr1.1. Head Loss Across a Hydraulic Jump Hydraulic jumps often are used to dissipate energy below spillways as a means ofpreventing erosion of artiﬁcial or natural channel bottom or sides. It is therefore ofinterest to be able to determine the head loss due to a hydraulic jump. From the energy equation for the jump, Eq. 11.34, we can solve for the head loss H l5E12E25V2 1 2g1y12V2 2 2g1y2/C18/C19 From continuity, V2=V1y1/y2,s o Hl5V2 1 2g12y1 y2/C18/C192"# 1ðy12y2Þ002468101214 1234 Upstream Froude number, Fr156789 (a) Depth ratio (b) Head lossEq. 11.39Eq. 11.36 10Depth ratio,y2 y1 000.100.200.300.400.500.600.70 24 Upstream Froude number, Fr168 1 0Dimensionless head loss,Hl E1 Fig. 11.15 Depth ratio and head loss for a hydraulic jump.

An alternative form of this result is obtained after some minor rearranging, Hl5½y22y1/C1383 4y1y2ð11:38bÞ which again shows that y2.y1for real ﬂows ( Hl.0).

Equation 11.39 is experimentally well veriﬁed, as can be seen in Fig. 11.15 b; the ﬁgure also shows that more than 70 percent of the mechanical energy of the entering stream is dissipated injumps with Fr 1.9. Inspection of Eq. 11.39 also shows that if Fr1= 1, then Hl= 0, and that negative values are predicted for Fr1,1. Since Hlmust be positive in any real ﬂow, this reconﬁrms that a hydraulic jump can occur only in supercritical ﬂow .Flow downstream from a jump always is subcritical .

Steady uniform ﬂow is something that is to beexpected to occur for channels of constant slope and cross section; Figs. 11.1 and 11.2show examples of this kind of ﬂow. Such ﬂows are very common and important, andhave been extensively studied. The simplest such ﬂow is fully developed ﬂow; it is analogous to fully developed ﬂow in pipes. A fully developed ﬂow is one for which the channel is prismatic, that is, a channel with constant slope and cross section that ﬂows at constant depth. This depth,y n, is termed the normal depth and the ﬂow is termed a uniform ﬂow . Hence the expression uniform ﬂow in this chapter has a different meaning than in earlier chapters. In earlier chapters it meant that the velocity was uniform at a section of the ﬂow; in this chapter we use it to mean that, but in addition speciﬁcally that the ﬂow is the same at all sections . Hence for the ﬂow shown in Fig. 11.16, we have A1=A2=A (cross-section areas), Q1=Q2=Q(ﬂow rates), V1=V2=V(average velocity, V=Q/A), andy1=y2=yn(ﬂow depth). As before (Section 11.2), we use the following assumptions: 1.Steady ﬂow 2.Incompressible ﬂow 3.Uniform velocity at a section 4.Gradually varying depth so that pressure distribution is hydrostatic 5.Bed slope is small _Ws5 _Wshear5 _Wother50Note that as illustrated in Fig. 11.13, y1,yc,y2.

(Strictly speaking they should be normal and parallel to the channel bottom, respectively.) The continuity equation is obvious for this case.

The body force FBx5Wsinθwhere W is the weight of ﬂuid in the control volume; θis the bed slope, as shown in Fig. 11.16. The surface force consists of the hydrostatic force on the two end surfaces at 1and 2 and the friction force Ffon the wetted surface of the control volume; however, because we have the same pressure distributions at 1and 2, the net xcomponent of pressure force is zero. Using all these results in Eq. 4.18d we obtain 2Ff1Wsinθ50 or Ff5Wsinθ ð11:40Þ We see that for ﬂow at normal depth, the component of the gravity force driving theﬂow is just balanced by the friction force acting on the channel walls. This is incontrast to ﬂow in a pipe or duct, for which (with the exception of pure gravity drivenﬂow) we usually have a balance between an applied pressure gradient and the friction.The friction force may be expressed as the product of an average wall shear stress, τ w, and the channel wetted surface area, PL(where Lis the channel length), on which the stress acts Ff5τwPL ð11:41Þ The component of gravity force can be written as Wsinθ5ρgALsinθ/C25ρgALθ/C25ρgALS b ð11:42ÞControl volume z1/onesans y1 = yn z2/twosans Sb = tan θ θy2 = yn Fig. 11.16 Control volume for uniform channel ﬂow.632 Chapter 11Flow in Open Channelswhere Sbis the channel bed slope.

Note that a number of these equations, as well as many that follow, are “engineering” equations; that is, the user needs to be aware of the required units of each term in the equation . In Table 11.1 we have previously listed data on A andRhfor various channel geometries. The relationship among variables in Eqs. 11.48 can be viewed in a number of ways.

For a speciﬁed ﬂow rate through a prismatic channel of given slope and roughness, Eqs. 11.48 also show that the depth of uniform ﬂow is a function of both channel size and shape, as well as the slope. There is only one depth for uniform ﬂow at a given ﬂow rate; it may be greater than, less than, orequal to the critical depth. This is illustrated in Examples 11.8 and 11.9.

Example 11.9 DETERMINATION OF FLUME SIZE An above-ground ﬂume, built from timber, is to convey water from a mountain lake to a small hydroelectric plant.The ﬂume is to deliver water at Q=2m 3/s; the slope is Sb= 0.002 and n= 0.013. Evaluate the required ﬂume size for (a) a rectangular section with y/b= 0.5 and (b) an equilateral triangular section.

Hence we see that for ﬂow at normal depth, the head loss due to friction is equal to the change in elevation of the bed . The speciﬁc energy, E, is the same at all sections, E5E15V2 1 2g1y15E25V2 2 2g1y5const For completeness we also compute the energy grade line EGL and hydraulic gradeline HGL.

The trends for the energy grade line, hydraulic grade line, and speciﬁc energy, are shown in Fig. 11.17. Optimum Channel Cross Section For given slope and roughness, the optimum channel cross section is that for which weneed the smallest channel for a given ﬂow rate; this is when Q/Ais maximized.

For any given prismatic channel shape (rectangular, trapezoidal, triangular, circular, etc.), the channel cross section can be optimized. Optimum cross sections for common channel shapes are given without proof in Table 11.3. Once the optimum cross section for a given channel shape has been determined, expressions for normal depth, yn, and area, A, as functions of ﬂow rate can be obtained from Eq. 11.48. These expressions are included in Table 11.3. 11.6 Flow with Gradually Varying Depth Most human-made channels are designed to have uniform ﬂow (for example, see Fig. 11.1). However, this is not true in some situations. A channel can have nonuniform ﬂow, that is, a ﬂow for which the depth and hence speed, and so on vary along the channelfor a number of reasons. Examples include when an open-channel ﬂow encounters achange in bed slope, geometry, or roughness, or is adjusting itself back to normal depthafter experiencing an upstream change (such as a sluice gate). We have already studied rapid, localized changes, such as that occurring in a hydraulic jump, but here we assume ﬂow depth changes gradually. Flow with gradually varying depth is analyzed by applyingthe energy equation to a differential control volume; the result is a differential equationTable 11.3 Properties of Optimum Open-Channel Sections (SI Units) Shape SectionOptimum Geometry ynQn Sbα /H11005 60/H11034 b /H11005Normal Depth, y nCross-Sectional Area, A 20.9681/23/8 3Qn Sb1.6221/23/4 Qn Sbb /H11005 2yn0.9171/23/8 Qn Sb1.6821/23/4 Qn SbD /H11005 2yn1.001/23/8 Qn Sb1.5831/23/4Qn Sbyn yn ynb b Dα α b >> yynyn α /H11005 45/H11034 1.2971/23/8 Qn Sb1.6821/23/4 (Q/b)n None — 1.00 Sb1/23/8Trapezoidal TriangularRectangular Wide Flat Circular11.6 Flow with Gradually Varying Depth 641that relates changes in depth to distance along the ﬂow. The resulting equation may be solved analytically or, more typically numerically, if we approximate the head loss at each section as being the same as that for ﬂow at normal depth, using the velocity and hydraulic radius of the section . Water depth and channel bed height are assumed to change slowly. As in the case of ﬂow at normal depth, velocity is assumed uniform, and the pressure distribution is assumed hydrostatic at each section. The energy equation (Eq. 11.10) for open-channel ﬂow was applied to a ﬁnite control volume in Section 11.2, V2 1 2g1y11z15V2 2 2g1y21z21Hl ð11:10Þ We apply this equation to the differential control volume, of length dx, shown in Fig. 11.18.

Using this in Eq. 11.59, we ﬁnally obtain our desired form of the energy equation for gradually varying ﬂow dydx5Sb2S 12Fr2ð11:60Þ This equation indicates how the depth yof the ﬂow varies. Whether the ﬂow becomes deeper ( dy/dx.0) or shallower ( dy/dx,0) depends on the sign of the right-hand side. For example, consider a channel that has a horizontal section ( Sb= 0): dydx52S 12Fr2 Because of friction the EGL always decreases, so S.0. If the incoming ﬂow is sub- critical ( Fr,1), the ﬂow depth will gradually decrease ( dy/dx,0); if the incoming ﬂow is supercritical ( Fr.1), the ﬂow depth will gradually increase ( dy/dx.0). Note also that for critical ﬂow ( Fr= 1), the equation leads to a singularity, and gradually ﬂow is no longer sustainable—something dramatic will happen (guess what). Calculation of Surface Proﬁles Equation 11.60 can be used to solve for the free surface shape y(x); the equation looks simple enough, but it is usually difﬁcult to solve analytically and so is solved numerically. It is difﬁcult to solve because the bed slope, Sb, the local Froude number, Fr, and S, the EGL slope equivalent to uniform ﬂow at rate Q, will in general all vary with location, x. For S, we use the results obtained in Section 11.5, speciﬁcally Q51 nAR2=3 hS1=2ð11:48aÞ or for English Engineering units11.6 Flow with Gradually Varying Depth 643Q51:49 nAR2=3 hS1=2ð11:48bÞ Note that we have used Srather than Sbin Eq. 11.48 as we are using the equation to obtain an equivalent value of Sfor a uniform ﬂow at rate Q!

Hence Eqs. 11.63 are usually best solved using a suitable numerical integration scheme. Example 11.10 shows such a calculation for the simplest case, that of a rectangular channel.

The weir essentially backs up water so that, in ﬂowing over the weir, the water goes through critical depth. Weirs have been used for the measurement of water ﬂow inopen channels for many years. Weirs can generally be classiﬁed as sharp-crested weirs andbroad-crested weirs . Weirs are discussed in detail in Bos [14], Brater [15], and Replogle [16]. Asharp-crested weir is basically a thin plate mounted perpendicular to the ﬂow with the top of the plate having a beveled, sharp edge, which makes the nappe springclear from the plate (see Fig. 11.19). The rate of ﬂow is determined by measuring the head, typically in a stilling well (see Fig. 11.20) at a distance upstream from the crest. The head His measured using a gage. Suppressed Rectangular Weir These sharp-crested weirs are as wide as the channel and the width of the nappe is thesame length as the crest. Referring to Fig. 11.20, consider an elemental area dA=bdh and assume the velocity is V5ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2ghp ; then the elemental ﬂow is dQ5bdhﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2ghp 5bﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2gp h 1=2dhNote (following the solution procedure of Example 11.8) that the normal depth for this ﬂow is yn50.858 m; the ﬂow depth is asymptotically approaching this value. In general, this is one of several possibilities,depending on the values of the initial depth and the channel properties (slopeand roughness). A ﬂow may approach normal depth, become deeper and deeper, or eventually become shallower and experience a hydraulic jump.The accuracyoftheresultsobtainedobviouslydependsonthenumericalmodelused ;forexample, amoreaccuratemodelis theRK4 method.Also,fortheﬁrst meterorso,therearerapidchan gesindepth,bringingintoquestionthevalidityofseveralassumptions,forexample, uniformﬂow and hydrostaticpressure.

The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in China is thelargest hydroelectric dam in the world. The generatingcapacity will eventually be 22,500 MW. The dam ismore than 2 km wide and 185 m tall, and its reservoirwill eventually stretch over 600 km upstream. Theconstruction of the dam was very controversial: Mil-lions of people had to be relocated, and we are still not sure of the long-term environmental consequences of this massive project. The most signiﬁcant function of the dam, apart from power generation, is to control ﬂooding. The reser-voir’s ﬂood storage capacity is 22 km 3; this will reduce the frequency of downstream ﬂooding from once every10 years to once every 100 years. Historically, anumber of large cities and a lot of farmland have been vulnerable to ﬂooding. For example, in 1954, almost 200,000 km 2of land were ﬂooded, killing over 30,000 people and forcing almost 20 million people to move;in 1998, a ﬂood in the same area affected over 2million people. With the dam, it is expected that majorﬂoods can be controlled. Ship locks for river trafﬁc to bypass the dam have been built so that shipping will become safer (the gorges were notoriously dangerous to navigate). Each ship lock is made up of ﬁve stages, taking around 4 hrin total to complete. In addition to the canal locks, theThree Gorges Dam is equipped with a ship lift capableof lifting ships of up to 3000 tons.652 Chapter 11Flow in Open ChannelsProblems Basic Concepts and Deﬁnitions 11.1 Verify the equation given in Table 11.1 for the hydraulic radius of a trapezoidal channel.

Evaluate and plot the ratio R/D, for liquid depths between 0 and D. 11.3 A wave from a passing boat in a lake is observed to travel at 10 mph. Determine the approximate water depth at this location. 11.4 A pebble is dropped into a stream of water that ﬂows in a rectangular channel at 2 m depth. In one second, a ripple caused by the stone is carried 7 m downstream. What is the speed of the ﬂowing water? 11.5 A pebble is dropped into a stream of water of uniform depth.

The stream depth is 150 mm.Determine the ﬂow speed and Froude number. Note that the wave travels at speed c(Eq. 11.6) normal to the wave front, as shown in the velocity diagram.Flow speed V Vcθ = 30° P11.9 11.10 The Froude number characterizes ﬂow with a free sur- face.

(The wave pattern of a sur-face ship also is pronounced at this Froude number.)

What are the minimum speciﬁc energies for these curves? 11.16 Find the critical depth for ﬂow at 3 m3/s in a rectan- gular channel of width 2.5 m. 11.17 A trapezoidal channel with a bottom width of 20 ft, side slopes of 1 to 2, channel bottom slope of 0.0016, and aManning’s nof 0.025 carries a discharge of 400 cfs. Compute the critical depth and velocity of this channel. 11.18 A rectangular channel carries a discharge of 10 ft3/s per foot of width. Determine the minimum speciﬁc energypossible for this ﬂow. Compute the corresponding ﬂow depth and speed. 11.19 Flow in the channel of Problem 11.18 ( Emin52.19 ft) is to be at twice the minimum speciﬁc energy. Compute the alternate depths for this E. 11.20 For a channel of nonrectangular cross section, critical depth occurs at minimum speciﬁc energy.

The Hydraulic Jump 11.31 Find the rate at which energy is being consumed (kW) by the hydraulic jump of Example 11.5. Is this sufﬁcient to produce a signiﬁcant temperature rise in the water? 11.32 A hydraulic jump occurs in a rectangular channel 4.0 m wide. The water depth before the jump is 0.4 m and 1.7 m after the jump. Compute the ﬂow rate in the channel, the critical depth, and the head loss in the jump. 11.33 A wide channel carries 10 m3/s per foot of width at a depth of 1 m at the toe of a hydraulic jump. Determine the depth of the jump and the head loss across it. 11.34 A hydraulic jump occurs in a wide horizontal channel. The discharge is 2 m3/s per meter of width. The upstream depth is 750 mm.

Determine the depth behind the jump and the head loss, ifthe channel is 10 ft wide. 11.36 The hydraulic jump may be used as a crude ﬂow meter. Suppose that in a horizontal rectangular channel 5 ft wide the observed depths before and after a hydraulic jump are 0.66 and 3.0 ft. Find the rate of ﬂow and the head loss. 11.37 A hydraulic jump occurs on a horizontal apron down- stream from a wide spillway, at a location where depth is 0.9m and speed is 25 m/s. Estimate the depth and speed downstream from the jump. Compare the speciﬁc energy downstream of the jump to that upstream. 11.38 A hydraulic jump occurs in a rectangular channel. The ﬂow rate is 50 m3/s, and the depth before the jump is 2 m.

However, a lot of work is being done on residential-scale devices. Scott Weinbrandt is the CEO of a companycalled Helix Wind . His background is in computer tech- nology, and he has lived through the computer industry,moving from large central mainframes to distributed personal computers. Scot ts a y sh e ’ ss e e i n gt h es a m e t r e n de m e r g i n gi nw i n de n e r g y. His company is targeting urban residential (and commercial) customers with the company’s range of small-scal e helical-shaped turbines;one of the models is shown in the photograph. As canbe seen, they are quite beautiful machines—excellentexamples of how engineering at its best can createattractive, as well as functional, machines. Helix Wind is ﬁnding that some customers are even buying themjust for the product’s aesthetic value! The turbinesare an elegant form of a Savonius turbine and so aregenerally considered less efﬁcient at generating electricity than the common horizontal-axis propeller- driven turbines. (Figure P9.97 in the problem set forChapter 9 shows a crude version of a Savonius tur-bine; such turbines are drag-based, as opposed tothe lift-based propeller turbines.) An advantage of thehelix design is that the helix shape generates a 657In Chapter 2 we brieﬂy discussed the two most important questions we must ask before analyzing a ﬂuid ﬂow: whether or not the ﬂow is viscous, and whether or notthe ﬂow is compressible. We subsequently considered incompressible, inviscid ﬂows (Chapter 6) and incompressible, viscous ﬂows (Chapters 8 and 9). We are now ready to study ﬂows that experience compressibility effects. Because this is an introductorytext, our focus will be mainly on one-dimensional compressible ,inviscid ﬂows, although we will also review some important compressible, viscous ﬂow phenomena. After our consideration of one-dimensional ﬂows, we will introduce some basicconcepts of two-dimensional steady compressible ﬂows . We ﬁrst need to establish what we mean by a “compressible” ﬂow. This is a ﬂow in which there are signiﬁcant or noticeable changes in ﬂuid density. Just as inviscid ﬂuidsdo not actually exist, so incompressible ﬂuids do not actually exist. For example, in this text we have treated water as an incompressible ﬂuid, although in fact the densitysecondary upward ﬂow that improves the overall aerodynamics, hence improving efﬁciency. Helix Wind says a key beneﬁt of the helical design is its ability to operate even in lower wind speeds,although high wind speeds will not present any difﬁ-culties. Recently an S322 model in California con-tinued to operate in wind speeds in excess of 60 mph,whereas a nearby conventional wind farm had many damaged turbine blades. TheHelix turbines, being vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs), have a number of advantages: They are easy to maintain because most of the moving parts arelocated near the ground; no yaw device is needed toorient the device into the wind; they usually have alower tip-speed ratio and so are less likely to break inhigh winds (see Fig. 10.50); they don’t have to shutdown in high wind speeds. On the other hand, apossible disadvantage of VAWTs is that they tend tobe a little less efﬁcient than horizontal-axis wind tur-bines. (See Fig. 10.50 for a comparison of Savoniusturbine and conventional turbine efﬁciencies.) TheHelix design has resulted in greatly increased efﬁ- ciency, overcoming this disadvantage, and Helix Wind turbines are now only 6/C0 7 percent less efﬁcient than the most efﬁcient HAWTs. The low-speed 2 kW Helix Wind turbine (which is only about 9 ft 34 ft) starts generating power at less than 10 mph and continues to do so up to about40 mph; it continues to spin with no damage to thesystem in winds as high as 80 mph, although no additional electricity is generated above the maximum output at 40 mph. Helix Wind turbines are safe for wildlife because they spin at much lower speeds thanhorizontal turbines and appear as a solid mass ratherthan a blurry blade that a bird cannot see. At about5 dB, the turbines are nearly silent because theyoperate with tip speeds close to the wind velocity(similar to the wind blowing around any stationary object such as a tree or house). Conventional wind turbines spin at up to 10 times the wind speed, whichcauses the whistling sound that can be heard aroundthem. The turbine spins no matter what direction thewind comes from (including vertically if it’s mountedon the side of a large building) and generates powereven in turbulence-prone urban environments. Helix Wind is conﬁdent that there will be a huge market for these residential and small commercial-scale turbines, including at such existing locations ascell phone towers, cruise ships, billboards, oil and gaspumping systems, and agricultural water pumping.The company says its wind turbines also are ideal foruse in developing countries, for example, for pumpingpotable water and providing electricity.

Hence, whether or not a given ﬂow can be treated as incompressible is a judgment call: Liquid ﬂows willalmost always be considered incompressible (exceptions include phenomena such as the “water hammer” effect in pipes), but gas ﬂows could easily be either incompres- sible or compressible. We will learn in this chapter (in Example 12.5) that for Machnumbers Mless than about 0.3, the change in gas density due to the ﬂow will be less than 3 percent; this change is small enough in most engineering applications for thefollowing rule: A gas ﬂow can be considered incompressible when M ,0.3. The consequences of compressibility are not limited simply to density changes. Density changes mean that we can have signiﬁcant compression or expansion work ona gas, so the thermodynamic state of the ﬂuid will change, meaning that in general allproperties—temperature, internal energy, entropy, and so on—can change. In particular, density changes create a mechanism (just as viscosity did) for exchange of energy between “mechanical” energies (kinetic, potential, and “pressure”) and thethermal internal energy. For this reason, we begin with a review of the thermo-dynamics needed to study compressible ﬂow. 12.1 Review of Thermodynamics The pressure, density, and temperature of a substance may be related by an equationof state. Although many substances are complex in behavior, experience shows thatmost gases of engineering interest, at moderate pressure and temperature, are well represented by the ideal gas equation of state, p5ρRT ð12:1Þ where Ris a unique constant for each gas; 1Ris given by R5Ru Mm where Ruis the universal gas constant, Ru58314 N /C1m/(kgmole /C1K)51544 ft/C1lbf/(lbmole /C1/C14R) and Mmis the molecular mass of the gas. Although the ideal gas equation is derived using a model that has the unrealistic assumptions that the gas molecules (a) take up zero volume (i.e., they are point masses) and (b) do not interact with one another, many real gases conform to Eq. 12.1, especially if the pres- sure is “low” enough and/or temperature “high” enough (see, e.g., [1 /C03]). For example, at room temperature, as long as the pressure is less than about 30 atm, Eq. 12.1 modelsthe air density to better than 1 percent accuracy; similarly, Eq. 12.1 is accurate for air at1 atm for temperatures that are greater than about 2130 /C14C( 1 4 0K ) . The ideal gas has other features that are useful. In general, the internal energy of a simple substance may be expressed as a function of any two independent properties,e.g., u5u(v,T), where v/C171/ρis the speciﬁc volume . Then du5@u @T/C18/C19 vdT1@u @v/C18/C19 Tdv The speciﬁc heat at constant volume is deﬁned as cv/C17(@u/@T)v, so that du5cvdT1@u @v/C18/C19 Tdv 1For air, R5287 N /C1m=ðkg/C1KÞ553:3f t /C1lbf=ðlbm/C1/C14RÞ.12.1 Review of Thermodynamics 659In particular, for an ideal gas it can be shown (see, e.g., Chapter 11 of [1]) that the internal energy, u, is a function of temperature only, so ( @u/@v)T50, and du5cvdT ð12:2Þ for an ideal gas. This means that internal energy and temperature changes may berelated if c vis known. Furthermore, since u5u(T), then from Eq. 12.2, cv5cv(T). Theenthalpy of any substance is deﬁned as h/C17u1p/ρ. For an ideal gas, p5ρRT, and so h5u1RT. Since u5u(T) for an ideal gas, halso must be a function of temperature alone. We can obtain a relation between handTby recalling once again that for a simple substance any property can be expressed as a function of any two other independentproperties [1], e.g., h5h(v,T) as we did for u,o r h5h(p,T). We choose the latter in order to develop a useful relation, dh5@h @T/C18/C19 pdT1@h @p/C18/C19 Tdp Since the speciﬁc heat at constant pressure is deﬁned as cp/C17(@h/@T)p, dh5cpdT1@h @p/C18/C19 Tdp We have shown that for an ideal gas his a function of Tonly. Consequently, (@h/@p)T50 and dh5cpdT ð12:3Þ Since his a function of Talone, Eq. 12.3 requires that cpbe a function of Tonly for an ideal gas. Although speciﬁc heats for an ideal gas are functions of temperature, their dif- ference is a constant for each gas. To see this, from h5u1RT we can write dh5du1RdT Combining this with Eq. 12.2 and Eq. 12.3, we can write dh5cpdT5du1RdT5cvdT1Rd T Then cp2cv5R ð12:4Þ It may seem a bit odd that we have functions of temperature on the left of Eq. 12.4 buta constant on the right; it turns out that the speciﬁc heats of an ideal gas change with temperature at the same rate, so their difference is constant. The ratio of speciﬁc heats is deﬁned as k/C17cp cvð12:5Þ Using the deﬁnition of k, we can solve Eq. 12.4 for either cporcvin terms of k andR. Thus, cp5kR k21ð12:6aÞ660 Chapter 12Introduction to Compressible Flowand cv5R k21ð12:6bÞ Although the speciﬁc heats of an ideal gas may vary with temperature, for moderate temperature ranges they vary only slightly, and can be treated as constant, so u22u15Zu2 u1du5ZT2 T1cvdT5cvðT22T1Þ ð12:7aÞ h22h15Zh2 h1dh5ZT2 T1cpdT5cpðT22T1Þ ð12:7bÞ Data for Mm,cp,cv,R,a n dk for common gases are given in Table A.6 of Appendix A. We will ﬁnd the property entropy to be extremely useful in analyzing compressible ﬂows. State diagrams, particularly the temperature-entropy ( Ts) diagram, are valu- able aids in the physical interpretation of analytical results. Since we shall makeextensive use of Tsdiagrams in solving compressible ﬂow problems, let us review brieﬂy some useful relationships involving the property entropy [1 /C03]. Entropy is deﬁned by the equation ΔS/C17Z revδQ TordS5δQ T/C18/C19 revð12:8Þ where the subscript signiﬁes reversible . The inequality of Clausius, deduced from the second law, states that IδQ T#0 As a consequence of the second law, we can write dS$δQ TorTd S$δQ ð12:9aÞ Forreversible processes, the equality holds, and Td s5δQ mreversible processðÞ ð12:9bÞ The inequality holds for irreversible processes, and Td s.δQ mirreversible processðÞ ð12:9cÞ For an adiabatic process, δQ/m50. Thus ds50 ðreversible adiabatic process Þ ð12:9dÞ and ds.0 ðirreversible adiabatic process Þ ð12:9eÞ Thus a process that is reversible and adiabatic is also isentropic ; the entropy remains constant during the process. Inequality 12.9e shows that entropy must increase for an adiabatic process that is irreversible. Equations 12.9 show that any two of the restrictions—reversible, adiabatic, or isentropic—imply the third. For example, a process that is isentropic and reversiblemust also be adiabatic.12.1 Review of Thermodynamics 661A useful relationship among properties ( p,v,T ,s ,u ) can be obtained by con- sidering the ﬁrst and second laws together. The result is the Gibbs, or Td s, equation Td s5du1pdv ð12:10aÞ This is a differential relationship among properties, valid for any process between any two equilibrium states. Although it is derived from the ﬁrst and second laws, it is, in itself, a statement of neither. An alternative form of Eq. 12.10a can be obtained by substituting du5dðh2pvÞ5dh2pdv2vdp to obtain Td s5dh2vdp ð12:10bÞ For an ideal gas, entropy change can be evaluated from the Td s equations as ds5du T1p Tdv5cvdT T1Rdv v ds5dh T2v Tdp5cpdT T2Rdp p For constant speciﬁc heats, these equations can be integrated to yield s22s15cvlnT2 T11Rlnv2 v1ð12:11aÞ s22s15cplnT2 T12Rlnp2 p1ð12:11bÞ and also s22s15cvlnp2 p11cplnv2 v1ð12:11cÞ (Equation 12.11c can be obtained from either Eq. 12.11a or 12.11b using Eq. 12.4 andthe ideal gas equation, Eq. 12.1, written in the form pv5RT, to eliminate T.) Example 12.1 shows use of the above governing equations (the Td s equations) to evaluate property changes during a process. For an ideal gas with constant speciﬁc heats, we can use Eqs. 12.11 to obtain relations valid for an isentropic process.

Qualitative information that is useful in drawing state diagrams also can be obtained from the Td s equations. To complete our review of the thermodynamic fundamentals, we evaluate the slopes of lines of constant pressure and of constant volume on the Tsdiagram in Example 12.2.

We will see in this chapter and the next that thespeed of sound, c, is an important marker in ﬂuid mechanics: Flows with speeds less than the speed of sound are called subsonic; ﬂows with speeds greater than the speed of sound are called supersonic ; and we will learn that the behaviors of subsonic and supersonic ﬂows are completely different. We have previously (in Chapter 2, and inChapter 7 with Eq. 7.16) deﬁned the Mach number Mof a ﬂow, and it is so important for our studies that we redeﬁne it here, M/C17V cð12:13Þ where Vis the speed (of the ﬂuid, or in some cases of the aircraft), so that M,1 and M.1 correspond to subsonic and supersonic ﬂow, respectively. In addition, we mentioned in Section 12.1 that we’ll demonstrate in Example 12.5 that for M,0.3, we can generally assume incompressible ﬂow. Hence, knowledge of the Mach numbervalue is important in ﬂuid mechanics. An answer to the question posed at the beginning of this section is that the speed of sound is important in ﬂuid mechanics because this is the speed at which “signals” cantravel through the medium. Consider, for example, an object such as an aircraft in motion—the air ultimately has to move out of its way. In Newton’s day, it was thought that this happened when the (invisible) air particles literally bounced off the front ofthe object, like so many balls bouncing off a wall; now we know that in most instancesT5T0eðs2s0Þ=cp ð2Þ Hence, we conclude that constant pressure lines in the Tsplane are also exponential. What about the slope of these curves? Because cp.cvfor all gases, we can see that the exponential, and therefore the slope, of the constant pressure curve, Eq. 2, is smaller than that for the constant volume curve, Eq. 1. This is shown in the sketch below: Constant pressureTemperature EntropyDecreasing Increasing pConstant volumeV This Exampleillustratesuseofgov-erningequationstoexplorerelationsamongprop erties. VIDEO Sound Waves (Animation). 12.2 Propagation of Sound Waves 665the air starts moving out of the way well before encountering the object (this will not be true when we have supersonic ﬂow!). How does the air “know” to move out of the way? It knows because as the object moves, it generates disturbances (inﬁnitesimal pressure waves—sound waves) that emanate from the object in all directions. It is these waves that cumulatively “signal” the air and redirect it around the body as itapproaches. These waves travel out at the speed of sound. [Sound is a pressure wave of very low pressure magnitude, for human hearing typically in the range of about 10 29atm (the threshold of hearing) to about 1023atm (you will feel pain!). Superimposed on the ambient atmospheric pressure, soundwaves consist of extremely small pressure ﬂuctuations. Because the range of humanhearing covers about ﬁve or six orders of magnitude in pressure, typically we use a dimensionless logarithmic scale, the decibel level, to indicate sound intensity; 0 dB corresponds to the threshold of hearing, and if you listen to your MP3 player at fullblast the sound will be at about 100 dB—about 10 10the intensity of the threshold of hearing!] Let us derive a method for computing the speed of sound in any medium (solid, liquid, or gas). As we do so, bear in mind that we are obtaining the speed of a“signal”—a pressure wave—and that the speed of the medium in which the wavetravels is a completely different thing. For example, if you watch a soccer player kick the ball (at the speed of light—the watching, that is), a fraction of a second later you will hear the thud of contact as the sound (a pressure wave) travels from the ﬁeld up toyou in the stands, but no air particles traveled between you and the player (all the airparticles simply vibrated a bit). Consider propagation of a sound wave of inﬁnitesimal strength into an undisturbed medium, as shown in Fig. 12.1 a. We are interested in relating the speed of wave propagation, c, to ﬂuid property changes across the wave. If pressure and density in the undisturbed medium ahead of the wave are denoted by pandρ, passage of the wave will cause them to undergo inﬁnitesimal changes to become p1dpandρ1dρ. Since the wave propagates into a stationary ﬂuid, the velocity ahead of the wave, V x,i s zero. The magnitude of the velocity behind the wave, Vx1dVx, then will be simply dVx; in Fig. 12.1 a, the direction of the motion behind the wave has been assumed to the left.2 Stationary observer /H11001 d ρ dVx p /H11001 dp pVx /H11005 0ρ /H11001 d ρ c /H11002 dVx p /H11001 dpρρ pcρcY X (a) Propagating wave (b) Inertial control volume moving with wave, velocity cy x Observer on CV Fig. 12.1 Propagating sound wave showing control volume chosen for analysis. 2The same ﬁnal result is obtained regardless of the direction initially assumed for motion behind the wave (see Problem 12.39).666 Chapter 12Introduction to Compressible FlowThe ﬂow of Fig. 12.1 aappears unsteady to a stationary observer, viewing the wave motion from a ﬁxed point on the ground. However, the ﬂow appears steady to an observer located onan inertial control volume moving with a segment of the wave, as shown in Fig. 12.1 b. The velocity approaching the control volume is then c, and the velocity leaving is c2dVx. The basic equations may be applied to the differential control volume shown in Fig. 12.1 b(we use Vxfor the xcomponent of velocity to avoid confusion with internal energy, u). a.

Equation 12.15 indicates that the speed of sound depends on how the pressure and density of the medium are related. To obtain the speed ofsound in a medium we could measure the time a sound wave takes to travel a pre-scribed distance, or instead we could apply a small pressure change dpto a sample, measure the corresponding density change dρ, and evaluate cfrom Eq. 12.15. For example, an incompressible medium would have dρ50 for any dp,s o c-N.W e can anticipate that solids and liquids (whose densities are difﬁcult to change) willhave relatively high cvalues, and gases (whose densities are easy to change) will have relatively low cvalues. There is only one problem with Eq. 12.15: For a simple sub- stance, each property depends on any twoindependent properties [1]. For a sound wave, by deﬁnition we have an inﬁnitesimal pressure change (i.e., it is reversible) , and it occurs very quickly, so there is no time for any heat transfer to occur (i.e., it is adiabatic ).

The important feature of sound propagation in an ideal gas, as shown by Eq. 12.18, is that the speed of sound is a function of temperature only . The variation in atmospheric temperature with altitude on a standard day was discussed in Chapter 3; the properties are summarized in Table A.3. The corresponding variation in cis computed as an exercise in Problem 12.40 and plotted as a function of altitude.

Flow ﬁelds that have both subsonic and supersonic regions are termed transonic. (The transonic regime occurs for Mach numbers between about 0.9 and 1.2.) Although most ﬂows within our experience are subsonic, there are important practical caseswhere M$1 occurs in a ﬂow ﬁeld. Perhaps the most obvious are supersonic aircraft and transonic ﬂows in aircraft compressors and fans. Yet another ﬂow regime, hyper- sonic ﬂow ( M^5), is of interest in missile and reentry-vehicle design. (The proposed National Aerospace Plane would have cruised at Mach numbers approaching 20.) Someimportant qualitative differences between subsonic and supersonic ﬂows can be deduced from the properties of a simple moving sound source. Consider a point source of sound that emits a pulse every Δtseconds. Each pulse expands outwards from its origination point at the speed of sound c, so at any instant tthe pulse will be a sphere of radius ctcentered at the pulse’s origination point. We want to investigate what happens if the point source itself is moving. There are four possibilities, as shown in Fig. 12.2 : (a)V50. The point source is stationary . Figure 12.2 ashows conditions after 3 Δt seconds. The ﬁrst pulse has expanded to a sphere of radius c(3Δt), the second to a sphere of radius c(2Δt), and the third to a sphere of radius c(Δt); a new pulse is about to be emitted. The pulses constitute a set of ever-expanding concentricspheres. (b)0,V,c. The point source moves to the left at subsonic speed. Figure 12.2 bshows conditions after 3 Δtseconds. The source is shown at times t50,Δt,2Δt,a n d3Δt. The ﬁrst pulse has expanded to a sphere of radius c(3Δt)centered where the source was originally, the second to a sphere of radius c(2Δt)centered where the source was at timeΔt, and the third to a sphere of radius c(Δt)centered where the source was at time 2Δt; a new pulse is about to be emitted. The pulses again constitute a set of ever-expanding spheres, except now they are not concentric. The pulses are allexpanding at constant speed c. We make two important notes: First, we can see that an observer who is ahead of the source (or whom the source is approaching)will hear the pulses at a higher frequency rate than will an observer who is behindthe source (this is the Doppler effect that occurs when a vehicle approaches andpasses); second, an observer ahead of the source hears the source before the source itself reaches the observer. (c)V5c. The point source moves to the left at sonic speed. Figure 12.2 cshows con- ditions after 3 Δtseconds.

The pulses are all expanding atconstant speed c,b u tt h es o u r c ei sa l s om o v i n ga ts p e e dc , with the result that the source and all its pulses are traveling together to the left. We again make twoimportant notes: First, we can see that an observer who is ahead of the source willnothear the pulses before the source reac hes her; second, in theory, over time an unlimited number of pulses will accumulate at the front of the source, leading to asound wave of unlimited amplitude (a source of concern to engineers trying to break the “sound barrier,” which many people thought could not be broken—Chuck Yeager in a Bell X-1 was the ﬁrst to do so in 1947). (d)V.c. The point source moves to the left at supersonic speed. Figure 12.2 dshows conditions after 3 Δtseconds. By now it is clear how the spherical waves develop. We can see once more that the pulses constitute a set of ever-expanding spheres, except now the source is moving so fast it moves ahead of each sphere that it generates! For supersonic motion, the spheres generate what is called a Mach cone tangent to each sphere. The region inside the cone is called the zone of action and that outside the cone the zone of silence , for obvious reasons, as shown in Fig. 12.2 e.

The visible vapor pattern is due to the sudden increase in pressure as a shock wave washes over the aircraft (we will see in the next chapter that a shock wave leadsto a sudden and large pressure increase). The (invisible) Mach cone emanates fromthe nose of the aircraft and passes through the periphery of the vapor disk. Example 12.4 MACH CONE OF A BULLET In tests of a protective material, we wish to photograph a bulletas it impacts a jacket made of the material. A camera is set up aperpendicular distance h55 m from the bullet trajectory. We wish to determine the perpendicular distance dfrom the target plane at which the camera must be placed such that the soundof the bullet will trigger the camera at the impact time. Note:The bullet speed is measured to be 550 m/s; the delay time of the camera is 0.005 s. Find: Location of camera for capturing impact image. Solution: The correct value of dis that for which the bullet hits the target 0.005 s before the Mach wave reaches the camera. We must ﬁrst ﬁnd the Mach number of the bullet; then we can ﬁnd the Mach angle; ﬁnally, we can use basic trigonometry to ﬁnd d. Assuming sea level conditions, from Table A.3 we have T5288 K.

(Ensign John Gay, USS Constellation , U.S. Navy.)672 Chapter 12Introduction to Compressible Flow12.3 Reference State: Local Isentropic Stagnation Properties In our study of compressible ﬂow, we will discover that, in general, allproperties ( p, T, ρ,u ,h ,s ,V ) may be changing as the ﬂow proceeds. We need to obtain reference conditions that we can use to relate conditions in a ﬂow from point to point. For any ﬂow, a reference condition is obtained when the ﬂuid is (in reality or conceptually)brought to rest ( V50). We will call this the stagnation condition , and the property values ( p 0,T0,ρ0,u0,h0,s0) at this state the stagnation properties . This process—of bringing the ﬂuid to rest—is not as straightforward as it seems. For example, do we doso while there is friction, or while the ﬂuid is being heated or cooled, or “violently,” orin some other way? The simplest process to use is an isentropic process, in which there is no friction, no heat transfer, and no “violent” events. Hence, the properties we obtain will be the local isentropic stagnation properties . Why “local”? Because the actual ﬂow can be any kind of ﬂow, e.g., with friction, so it may or may not itselfbe isentropic. Hence, each point in the ﬂow will have its own, or local, isentropicstagnation properties. This is illustrated in Fig. 12.4 , showing a ﬂow from some state 1to some new state 2. The local isentropic stagnation properties for each state, obtained by isentropically bringing the ﬂuid to rest, are also shown. Hence, s015s1and s025s2. The actual ﬂow may or may not be isentropic. If it isisentropic, s15s25s015s02, so the stagnation states are identical; if it is notisentropic, then s016¼s02. We will see that changes in local isentropic stagnation properties will provide useful informationabout the ﬂow. We can obtain information on the reference isentropic stagnation state for incompressible ﬂows by recalling the Bernoulli equation from Chapter 6 p ρ1V2 21gz5constant ð6:8Þ valid for a steady, incompressible, frictionless ﬂow along a streamline. Equation 6.8is valid for an incompressible isentropic process because it is reversible (frictionlessThen we can ﬁnd the Mach number, M5V c5550 m =s 340 m =s51:62 From Eq. 12.19 we can next ﬁnd the Mach angle, α5sin211 M/C18/C19 5sin211 1:62/C18/C19 538:2/C14 The distance xtraveled by the bullet while the Mach wave reaches the camera is then x5h tanðαÞ55m tanð38:2/C14Þ56:35 m Finally, we must add to this the time traveled by the bullet while the camera is operating, which is 0.005 s 3550 m/s, d50:005 s3550 m s16:35 m52:75 m16:35 m d59:10 m ßd12.3 Reference State: Local Isentropic Stagnation Properties 673and steady) and adiabatic (we did not include heat transfer considerations in its derivation). As we saw in Section 6.3, the Bernoulli equation leads to p05p11 2ρV2ð6:11Þ (The gravity term drops out because we assume the reference state is at the same elevation as the actual state, and in any event in external ﬂows it is usually much smaller than the other terms.) In Example 12.6 we compare isentropic stagnation conditionsobtained assuming incompressibility (Eq. 6.11), and allowing for compressibility. Forcompressible ﬂows, we will focus on ideal gas behavior. Local Isentropic Stagnation Properties for the Flow of an Ideal Gas For a compressible ﬂow we can derive the isentropic stagnation relations by applyingthe mass conservation (or continuity) and momentum equations to a differentialcontrol volume, and then integrating. For the process shown schematically in Fig. 12.4 , we can depict the process from state 1to the corresponding stagnation state by imagining the control volume shown in Fig. 12.5.

(Note that for incompressible ﬂow, it immediately leads to Eq. 6.11.) In developing thisrelation, we have speciﬁed a frictionless deceleration process. Before we can integratebetween the initial and ﬁnal (stagnation) states, we must specify the relation that exists between pressure, p, and density, ρ, along the process path. Since the deceleration process is isentropic, then pandρfor an ideal gas are related by the expression p ρk5constant ð12:12cÞy x 0 1CV Stream tube V = 0 p = p0 T = T0dxdRx + d Vx + dVx A + dA p + dp T + dTρ ρ ρ Vx A p TFlow Fig. 12.5 Compressible ﬂow in an inﬁnitesimal stream tube.12.3 Reference State: Local Isentropic Stagnation Properties 675Our task now is to integrate Eq. 12.20b subject to this relation.

We will usually use Eqs. 12.21 in lieu of the continuityand momentum equations for relating the properties at a state to that state’s stagnationproperties, but it is important to remember that we derived Eqs. 12.21 using theseequations andthe isentropic relation for an ideal gas.

The associated Excel workbook, Isentropic Relations , available on the Web site, can be used to print a larger table of values for air and other ideal gases. The calculation procedure is illustrated in Example 12.5. The Mach number range for validity of the assumption of incompressible ﬂow is investigated in Example 12.6.

A useful reference value for velocity is the critical speed —the speed Vwe attain when a ﬂow is either accelerated or decelerated (actually or conceptually) isentropically until we reach M51. Even if there is no point in a given ﬂow ﬁeld where the Mach number is equal to unity, such a hypothetical condition still is useful as a reference condition.

(Courtesy of NASA.)Most of us are familiar with the fact that supersonicaircraft generally have very sharp noses and wing leading edges, compared to subsonic aircraft (we will learn some reasons why supersonic aircraft are soshaped in the next chapter); compare, for example,the decommissioned supersonic Concorde to thesubsonic Boeing 747 jumbo jet. We are also familiarwith the notion of a sonic boom, a large window-rattling boom created when the remains of a super-sonic jet’s oblique shock wave wash over the ground. The sonic boom is an important reason that the Con- corde was not allowed to ﬂy supersonically over land,limiting its use and being one factor in the aircraft’slimited commercial success.682 Chapter 12Introduction to Compressible FlowReferences 1.Cengel, Y.

Acoustical Society of America, 79, 5, May 1986, pp. 1359 /C01366. Problems Review of Thermodynamics 12.1 An air ﬂow in a duct passes through a thick ﬁlter. What happens to the pressure, temperature, and density of the air as it does so? Hint: This is a throttling process. 12.2 Air is expanded in a steady ﬂow process through a tur- bine. Initial conditions are 1300/C14C and 2.0 MPa (abs). Final conditions are 500/C14C and atmospheric pressure. Show this process on a Tsdiagram. Evaluate the changes in internal energy, enthalpy, and speciﬁc entropy for this process. 12.3 A vendor claims that an adiabatic air compressor takes in air at atmosphere pressure and 50/C14F and delivers the air at 150 psig and 200/C14F. Is this possible? Justify your answer by calculation. Sketch the process on a Tsdiagram. 12.4 A turbine manufacturer claims that an adiabatic gas turbine can take ﬂow at 10 atmospheres and 2200/C14F and exhaust to atmospheric pressure at a temperature of 850/C14F. Sketch the process on a Tsdiagram, and prove whether the manufacturer’s claims are possible. Assume that the gas hasthe same properties as air. 12.5 Air initially at 50 psia and 660/C14R expands to atmospheric pressure. The process by which this expansion occurs is deﬁned by the expression pV---1.3= constant. Calculate the ﬁnal temperature and the change in entropy through this process. 12.6 What is the lowest possible delivery temperature gen- erated by an adiabatic air compressor, starting with standardatmosphere conditions and delivering the air at 500 kPa (gage)? Sketch the process on a Tsdiagram. 12.7 Air expands without heat transfer through a turbine from a pressure of 10 bars and a temperature of 1400 K to a pressure of 1 bar. If the turbine has an efﬁciency of 80 per- cent, determine the exit temperature, and the changes inenthalpy and entropy across the turbine. If the turbine isgenerating 1 MW of power, what is the mass ﬂow rate of airthrough the turbine? 12.8 A test chamber is separated into two equal chambers by a rubber diaphragm. One contains air at 20/C14C and 200 kPa (absolute), and the other has a vacuum. If the diaphragm ispunctured, ﬁnd the pressure and temperature of the air after it expands to ﬁll the chamber. Hint: This is a rapid, violent event, so is irreversible but adiabatic. 12.9 An automobile supercharger is a device that pressurizes the air that is used by the engine for combustion to increase theengine power (how does it differ from a turbocharger?). A supercharger takes in air at 70 /C14F and atmospheric pressure and boosts it to 200 psig, at an intake rate of 0.5 ft3/s. What are the pressure, temperature, and volume ﬂow rate at the exit?(The relatively high exit temperature is the reason an inter-cooler is also used.) Assuming a 70 percent efﬁciency, what is the power drawn by the supercharger? Hint: The efﬁciency is deﬁned as the ratio of the isentropic power to actual power. 12.10 Five kilograms of air is cooled in a closed tank from 250 to 50/C14C. The initial pressure is 3 MPa. Compute the changes in entropy, internal energy, and enthalpy. Show the process state points on a Tsdiagram. 12.11 Air is contained in a piston-cylinder device. The tem- perature of the air is 100/C14C. Using the fact that for a reversible process the heat transfer q5RTds, compare the amount of heat (J/kg) required to raise the temperature of the air to 1200/C14C at (a) constant pressure and (b) constant volume. Verify your results using the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. Plot the processes on a Tsdiagram. 12.12 The four-stroke Otto cycle of a typical automobile engine is sometimes modeled as an ideal air-standard closed system. In this simpliﬁed system the combustion process ismodeled as a heating process, and the exhaust-intake processThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and NASA have now shown that modifying an aircraft’s shape can also change the shape of its sonicboom, thereby reducing the loudness developed. TheirShaped Sonic Boom Demonstration (SSBD) programfound that by designing the aircraft to a speciﬁc shape,the pressure waves created by the aircraft can be kept from merging into a shock wave (see the discussion of the Mach cone in Section 12.2 ); when these weakerwaves reach the ground, the loudness of the sonic boomis greatly reduced. For the demonstration, NorthropGrumman modiﬁed an F-5E ﬁghter aircraft by installinga specially shaped “nose glove”; compare the nose ofthe SSBD (the lower aircraft in the ﬁgure) to the tradi-tional supersonic nose of a supersonic F-15B. It is possible that this new nose shape could eventually allow reintroduction of supersonic transports, even forthe key routes across the continental United States.Problems 683as a cooling process of the working ﬂuid (air). The cycle con- sists of: isentropic compression from state 1(p15100 kPa (abs), T1520/C14C,V---15500 cc) to state 2(V---25V---1=8:5); isometric (constant volume) heat addition to state 3 (T352750/C14C); isentropic expansion to state 4(V---45V---1); and isometric cooling back to state 1.P l o tt h e pV---andTsdia- grams for this cycle, and ﬁnd the efﬁciency, deﬁned as the network (the cycle area in pV---space) divided by the heat added. 12.13 The four-stroke cycle of a typical diesel engine is sometimes modeled as an ideal air-standard closed system. In this simpliﬁed system the combustion process is modeled as a heating process, and the exhaust-intake process as acooling process of the working ﬂuid (air). The cycle consists of: isentropic compression from state 1(p15100 kPa (abs), T1520/C14C,V---15500 cc) to state 2(V---25V---1=12:5); isometric (constant volume) heat addition to state 3(T353000/C14C); isobaric heat addition to state 4(V---451:75V---3); isentropic expansion to state 5; and isometric cooling back to state 1. Plot the pV---and Tsdiagrams for this cycle, and ﬁnd the efﬁciency, deﬁned as the net work (the cycle area in pV--- space) divided by the heat added. 12.14 A 1-m3tank contains air at 0.1 MPa (abs) and 20/C14C. The tank is pressurized to 2 MPa. Assuming that the tank is ﬁlled adiabatically and reversibly, calculate the ﬁnal tem- perature of the air in the tank. Now assuming that the tank is ﬁlled isothermally, how much heat is lost by the air in thetank during ﬁlling? Which process (adiabatic or isothermal)results in a greater mass of air in the tank? 12.15 A tank of volume V---510 m3contains compressed air at 15/C14C. The gage pressure in the tank is 4.50 MPa. Evaluate the work required to ﬁll the tank by compressing air fromstandard atmosphere conditions for (a) isothermal com- pression and (b) isentropic compression followed by cooling at constant pressure. What is the peak temperature of theisentropic compression process? Calculate the energy removed during cooling for process (b). Assume ideal gas behavior and reversible processes. Label state points on a Ts diagram and a pV---diagram for each process. 12.16 Air enters a turbine in steady ﬂow at 0.5 kg/s with negligible velocity. Inlet conditions are 1300/C14C and 2.0 MPa (abs). The air is expanded through the turbine to atmosphericpressure. If the actual temperature and velocity at the turbineexit are 500 /C14C and 200 m/s, determine the power produced by the turbine. Label state points on a Tsdiagram for this process. 12.17 Natural gas, with the thermodynamic properties of methane, ﬂows in an underground pipeline of 0.6 mdiameter. The gage pressure at the inlet to a compressor station is 0.5 MPa; outlet pressure is 8.0 MPa (gage). The gas temperature and speed at inlet are 13 /C14C and 32 m/s, respectively. The compressor efﬁciency is η50.85. Calculate the mass ﬂow rate of natural gas through the pipeline. Labelstate points on a Tsdiagram for compressor inlet and outlet. Evaluate the gas temperature and speed at the compressor outlet and the power required to drive the compressor. 12.18 Over time the efﬁciency of the compressor of Problem 12.17 drops. At what efﬁciency will the power required to attain 8.0 MPa (gage) exceed 30 MW? Plot the required power and the gas exit temperature as functions of efﬁciency.12.19 Improper maintenance on the turbine of Problem 12.7 has resulted in a gradual decrease in its efﬁciency over time. Assuming that the efﬁciency drops by 1 percent per year, how long would it take for the power output of the turbine to drop to 950 kW, assuming that entrance conditions, ﬂow rate,and exhaust pressure were all kept constant? 12.20 In an isothermal process, 0.1 cubic feet of standard air per minute (SCFM) is pumped into a balloon. Tension inthe rubber skin of the balloon is given by σ5kA, where k5200 lbf/ft 3, and Ais the surface area of the balloon in ft2. Compute the time required to increase the balloon radiusfrom 5 to 7 in. 12.21 For the balloon process of Problem 12.20 we could deﬁne a “volumetric ratio” as the ratio of the volume of standard air supplied to the volume increase of the balloon, per unit time. Plot this ratio over time as the balloon radius isincreased from 5 to 7 in. Propagation of Sound Waves 12.22 A sound pulse level above about 20 Pa can cause permanent hearing damage. Assuming such a sound wavetravels through air at 20 /C14C and 100 kPa, estimate the density, temperature, and velocity change immediately after thesound wave passes. 12.23 Calculate the speed of sound at 20/C14C for (a) hydrogen, (b) helium, (c) methane, (d) nitrogen, and (e) carbon dioxide. 12.24 The bulk modulus Evof a material indicates how hard it is to compress the material; a large Evindicates the material requires a large pressure to compress. Is air “stiffer”when suddenly or slowly compressed? To answer this, ﬁndexpressions in terms of instantaneous pressure pfor the bulk modulus of air (kPa) when it is (a) rapidly compressed and(b) slowly compressed. Hint: Rapid compression is approxi- mately isentropic (it is adiabatic because it is too quick for heat transfer to occur), and slow compression is isothermal (there is plenty of time for the air to equilibrate to ambienttemperature). 12.25 You have designed a device for determining the bulk modulus, Ev, of a material. It works by measuring the time delay between sending a sound wave into a sample ofthe material and receiving the wave after it travels throughthe sample and bounces back. As a test, you use a 1-m rod of steel ( E v/C25200 GN/m2). What time delay should your device indicate? You now test a 1-m rod (1 cm diameter) of an unknown material and ﬁnd a time delay of 0.5 ms. The mass of the rod is measured to be 0.25 kg. What is this material’s bulk modulus? 12.26 Dolphins often hunt by listening for sounds made by their prey. They “hear” with the lower jaw, which conducts the sound vibrations to the middle ear via a fat-ﬁlled cavity in the lower jaw bone. If the prey is half a mile away, howlong after a sound is made does a dolphin hear it? Assume the seawater is at 68 /C14F. 12.27 A submarine sends a sonar signal to detect the enemy. The reﬂected wave returns after 3.25 s. Estimate the separation between the submarines. (As an approximation,assume the seawater is at 20 /C14C.)684 Chapter 12Introduction to Compressible Flow12.28 An airplane ﬂies at 550 km/hr at 1500 m altitude on a standard day. The plane climbs to 15,000 m and ﬂies at 1200 km/h. Calculate the Mach number of ﬂight in both cases. 12.29 Next-generation missiles will use scramjet engines to travel at Mach numbers as high as 7. If a scramjet-poweredmissile travels at Mach 7 at an altitude of 85,000 ft, how longwill it take for the missile to travel 600 nautical miles? Assume standard atmospheric conditions. ( Note: This is the range for the Tomahawk missile, which uses a conventional propulsion system, but it takes 90 min to cover that same distance.) 12.30 Actual performance characteristics of the Lockheed SR-71 “Blackbird” reconnaissance aircraft never werereleased. However, it was thought to cruise at M53.3 at 85,000 ft altitude. Evaluate the speed of sound and ﬂight speed for these conditions. Compare to the muzzle speed of a 30-06 riﬂe bullet (700 m/s). 12.31 The Boeing 727 aircraft of Example 9.8 cruises at 520 mph at 33,000 ft altitude on a standard day. Calculate thecruise Mach number of the aircraft. If the maximum allow- able operating Mach number for the aircraft is 0.9, what is the corresponding ﬂight speed? 12.32 Investigate the effect of altitude on Mach number by plotting the Mach number of a 500 mph airplane as it ﬂies at altitudes ranging from sea level to 10 km. 12.33 You are watching a July 4th ﬁreworks display from a distance of one mile. How long after you see an explosion do you hear it? You also watch New Year’s ﬁreworks (same place and distance). How long after you see an explosion do you hear it? Assume it’s 75/C14F in July and 5/C14F in January. 12.34 The X-15 North American rocket plane held the record for the fastest manned ﬂight. In 1967, the X-15 ﬂew at a speed of 7270 km/h at an altitude of 58.4 km. At what Mach number did the X-15 ﬂy? 12.35 You need to estimate the speed of a hypersonic air- craft traveling at Mach 7 and 120,000 ft. Not having a table of atmospheric tables handy, you remember that through the stratosphere (approximately 36,000 ft to 72,000 ft) the tem-perature of air is nearly constant at 390 /C14R, and you assume this temperature for your calculation. Later, you obtain the appropriate data and recalculate the speed. What was the percentage error? What would the percentage error havebeen if you used the air temperature at sea level? 12.36 The grandstand at the Kennedy Space Center is located 3.5 mi away from the Space Shuttle Launch Pad.On a day when the air temperature is 80 /C14F, how long does it take the sound from a blastoff to reach the spectators? If the launch was early on a winter morning, the temperature may be as low as 50/C14F. How long would the sound take to reach the spectators under those conditions? 12.37 While working on a pier on a mountain lake, you notice that the sounds of your hammering are echoing fromthe mountains in the distance. If the temperature is 25 /C14C and the echoes reach you 3 seconds after the hammer strike,how far away are the mountains? 12.38 Use data for speciﬁc volume to calculate and plot the speed of sound in saturated liquid water over the tempera-ture range from 0 to 200 /C14C.12.39 Re-derive the equation for sonic speed (Eq. 12.18) assuming that the direction of ﬂuid motion behind the soundwave is dV xto the right. Show that the result is identical to that given by Eq. 12.18. 12.40 Compute the speed of sound at sea level in standard air. By scanning data from Table A.3 into your PC (or usingFig. 3.3), evaluate the speed of sound and plot for altitudes to 90 km. 12.41 The temperature varies linearly from sea level to approximately 11 km altitude in the standard atmosphere. Evaluate the lapse rate —the rate of decrease of temperature with altitude—in the standard atmosphere. Derive an expres- sion for the rate of change of sonic speed with altitude in an ideal gas under standard atmospheric conditions. Evaluate and plot from sea level to 10 km altitude. 12.42 Air at 77/C14F ﬂows at M51.9. Determine the air speed and the Mach angle. 12.43 Consider the hypersonic aircraft of Problem 12.35. How long would it take for an observer to hear the aircraftafter it ﬂies over the observer? In that elapsed time, how fardid the aircraft travel? 12.44 A projectile is ﬁred into a gas (ratio of speciﬁc heats k51.625) in which the pressure is 450 kPa (abs) and the density is 4.5 kg/m3. It is observed experimentally that a Mach cone emanates from the projectile with 25/C14total angle. What is the speed of the projectile with respect to thegas? 12.45 A photograph of a bullet shows a Mach angle of 32/C14. Determine the speed of the bullet for standard air. 12.46 The National Transonic Facility (NTF) is a high-speed wind tunnel designed to operate with air at cryogenic tem-peratures to reduce viscosity, thus raising the unit Reynoldsnumber ( Re/x) and reducing pumping power requirements. Operation is envisioned at temperatures of 2270 /C14F and below. A schlieren photograph taken in the NTF showsa Mach angle of 57 /C14where T52270/C14F and p51.3 psia. Evaluate the local Mach number and ﬂow speed. Calculatethe unit Reynolds number for the ﬂow. 12.47 An F-4 aircraft makes a high-speed pass over an air- ﬁeld on a day when T535/C14C. The aircraft ﬂies at M51.4 and 200 m altitude. Calculate the speed of the aircraft. Howlong after it passes directly over point A on the ground doesits Mach cone pass over point A? 12.48 While jogging on the beach (it’s a warm summer day, about 25/C14C) a high-speed jet ﬂies overhead. You guesstimate that it’s at an altitude of about 3000 m, and count off about7.5 s before you hear it. Estimate the speed and Machnumber of the jet. 12.49 An aircraft passes overhead at 3 km altitude. The aircraft ﬂies at M51.5; assume air temperature is constant at 20/C14C. Find the air speed of the aircraft. A headwind blows at 30 m/s. How long after the aircraft passes directly over- head does its sound reach a point on the ground? 12.50 A supersonic aircraft ﬂies at 3 km altitude at a speed of 1000 m/s on a standard day. How long after passing directly above a ground observer is the sound of the aircraft heard by the ground observer?Problems 68512.51 For the conditions of Problem 12.50, ﬁnd the location at which the sound wave that ﬁrst reaches the ground observer was emitted. 12.52 The Concorde supersonic transport cruised at M52.2 at 17 km altitude on a standard day. How long after the air-craft passed directly above a ground observer was the soundof the aircraft heard? 12.53 The airﬂow around an automobile is assumed to be incompressible. Investigate the validity of this assumptionfor an automobile traveling at 60 mph. (Relative to theautomobile the minimum air velocity is zero, and the max- imum is approximately 120 mph.) 12.54 Opponents of supersonic transport aircraft claim that sound waves can be refracted in the upper atmosphere and that, as a result, sonic booms can be heard several hundred miles away from the ground track of the aircraft. Explain the phenomenon of sound wave refraction. Reference State: Local Isentropic Stagnation Properties 12.55 Plot the percentage discrepancy between the density at the stagnation point and the density at a location where the Mach number is M, of a compressible ﬂow, for Mach num- bers ranging from 0.05 to 0.95. Find the Mach numbers at which the discrepancy is 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent. 12.56 Find the stagnation temperature at the nose of the missile described in Problem 12.29. 12.57 Find the stagnation temperature at the nose of the aircraft described in Problem 12.34. 12.58 Find the ratio of static to total pressure for a car moving at 55 mph and for a Formula One race car traveling at 220 mph at sea level. Do you expect the ﬂow over eithercar to experience compressibility effects? 12.59 Find the dynamic and stagnation pressures for the missile described in Problem 12.29. 12.60 Find the dynamic and stagnation pressures for the aircraft described in Problem 12.34. 12.61 An aircraft ﬂies at 250 m/s in air at 28 kPa and 250/C14C. Find the stagnation pressure at the nose of the aircraft. 12.62 Compute the air density in the undisturbed air, and at the stagnation point, of Problem 12.61. What is the percen- tage increase in density? Can we approximate this as an incompressible ﬂow? 12.63 For an aircraft traveling at M52 at an elevation of 12 km, ﬁnd the dynamic and stagnation pressures. 12.64 A body moves through standard air at 200 m/s. What is the stagnation pressure on the body? Assume (a) compres-sible ﬂow and (b) incompressible ﬂow. 12.65 Consider ﬂow of standard air at 600 m/s. What is the local isentropic stagnation pressure? The stagnation enthalpy? The stagnation temperature? 12.66 A DC-10 aircraft cruises at 12 km altitude on a stan- dard day. A pitot-static tube on the nose of the aircraft measures stagnation and static pressures of 29.6 kPa and 19.4 kPa. Calculate (a) the ﬂight Mach number of the aircraft,(b) the speed of the aircraft, and (c) the stagnation tem- perature that would be sensed by a probe on the aircraft. 12.67 An aircraft cruises at M50.65 at 10 km altitude on a standard day. The aircraft speed is deduced from measure- ment of the difference between the stagnation and static pressures. What is the value of this difference? Compute theair speed from this actual difference assuming (a) compres- sibility and (b) incompressibility. Is the discrepancy in air- speed computations signiﬁcant in this case? 12.68 The Anglo-French Concorde supersonic transport cruised at M52.2 at 20 km altitude. Evaluate the speed of sound, aircraft ﬂight speed, and Mach angle. What was themaximum air temperature at stagnation points on the air-craft structure? 12.69 Modern high-speed aircraft use “air data computers” to compute air speed from measurement of the differencebetween the stagnation and static pressures. Plot, as a func-tion of actual Mach number M, for M50.1 to M50.9, the percentage error in computing the Mach number assuming incompressibility (i.e., using the Bernoulli equation), from this pressure difference. Plot the percentage error in speed,as a function of speed, of an aircraft cruising at 12 km alti- tude, for a range of speeds corresponding to the actual Mach number ranging from M50.1 to M50.9. 12.70 A supersonic wind tunnel test section is designed to have M52.5 at 15/C14C and 35 kPa (abs). The ﬂuid is air. Determine the required inlet stagnation conditions, T0and p0. Calculate the required mass ﬂow rate for a test section area of 0.175 m2. 12.71 Air ﬂows steadily through a length ( 1denotes inlet and 2denotes exit) of insulated constant-area duct. Prop- erties change along the duct as a result of friction.

Explain these results. 12.72 A new design for a supersonic transport is tested in a wind tunnel at M51.8. Air is the working ﬂuid. The stag- nation temperature and pressure for the wind tunnel are 200psia and 500 /C14F, respectively. The model wing area is 100 in2. The measured lift and drag are 12,000 lbf and 1600 lbf, respectively. Find the lift and drag coefﬁcients. 12.73 For aircraft ﬂying at supersonic speeds, lift and drag coefﬁcients are functions of Mach number only. A super-sonic transport with wingspan of 75 m is to ﬂy at 780 m/s at20 km altitude on a standard day. Performance of the aircraftis to be measured from tests of a model with 0.9 m wingspan in a supersonic wind tunnel. The wind tunnel is to be sup- plied from a large reservoir of compressed air, which can be686 Chapter 12Introduction to Compressible Flowheated if desired. The static temperature of air in the test section is to be 10/C14C to avoid freezing of moisture. At what air speed should the wind tunnel tests be run to duplicate the Mach number of the prototype? What must be the stagnation temperature in the reservoir? What pressure is required inthe reservoir if the test section pressure is to be 10 kPa (abs)? 12.74 Actual performance characteristics of the Lockheed SR-71 “Blackbird” reconnaissance aircraft were classiﬁed.However, it was thought to cruise at M53.3 at 26 km altitude. Calculate the aircraft ﬂight speed for these conditions. Determine the local isentropic stagnation pressure. Because the aircraft speed is supersonic, a normal shock occurs in frontof a total-head tube. The stagnation pressure decreases by 74.7 percent across the shock. Evaluate the stagnation pres- sure sensed by a probe on the aircraft. What is the maximumair temperature at stagnation points on the aircraft structure? 12.75 The NASA X-43A Hyper-X experimental vehicle traveled at M= 9.68 at an altitude of 110,000 ft. Calculate the ﬂight speed for these conditions. Determine the local stag-nation pressure. Because the aircraft speed is supersonic, anormal shock wave occurs in front of a total-head tube. However, the shock wave results in a stagnation pressure decrease of 99.6 percent. Evaluate the stagnation pressuresensed by a probe on the aircraft. What is the maximum air temperature at stagnation points on the aircraft structure? 12.76 Air ﬂows in an insulated duct. At point 1the con- ditions are M150.1, T1520/C14C, and p151.0 MPa (abs). Downstream, at point 2, because of friction the conditions areM250.7,T2525.62/C14C, and p25136.5 kPa (abs). (Four signiﬁcant ﬁgures are given to minimize roundoff errors.) Compare the stagnation temperatures at points 1and 2, and explain the result. Compute the stagnation pressures at points 1and 2. Can you explain how it can be that the velocity increases for this frictional ﬂow? Should this process be isentropic or not? Justify your answer by computing thechange in entropy between points 1and 2. Plot static and stagnation state points on a Tsdiagram. 12.77 Air is cooled as it ﬂows without friction at a rate of 0.05 kg/s in a duct. At point 1the conditions are M150.5, T15500/C14C, and p15500 kPa (abs). Downstream, at point 2, the conditions are M250.2,T25218.57/C14C, and p25639.2 kPa (abs).

Compute the stagnation pressures at points 1and Should this process be isentropic or not? Justify your answer by computing the change in entropy between points 1 and 2. Plot static and stagnation state points on a Tsdiagram. 12.78 Consider steady, adiabatic ﬂow of air through a long straight pipe with A50.05 m2. At the inlet (section 1) the air is at 200 kPa (abs), 60/C14C, and 146 m/s. Downstream at section 2, the air is at 95.6 kPa (abs) and 280 m/s. Deter- mine p01,p02,T01,T02, and the entropy change for the ﬂow. Show static and stagnation state points on a Tsdiagram. 12.79 Air ﬂows steadily through a constant-area duct. At section 1, the air is at 400 kPa (abs), 325 K, and 150 m/s. As a result of heat transfer and friction, the air at section 2 downstream is at 275 kPa (abs), 450 K. Calculate the heattransfer per kilogram of air between sections 1and 2, and the stagnation pressure at section 2. 12.80 The combustion process in a ramjet engine is modeled as simple heat addition to air in a frictionless duct. Considersuch a combustor, with air ﬂowing at a rate of 0.1 lbm/s. At point 1the conditions are M10.2, T15600/C14F, and p157 psia. Downstream, at point 2, the conditions are M250.9,T251890/C14F, and p254.1 psia. Compare the stag- nation temperatures at points 1and 2, and explain the result. Compute the rate of heat addition to the ﬂow. Com- pute the stagnation pressures at points 1and 2. Should this process be isentropic or not? Justify your answer by computing the change in entropy between points 1and 2. Plot static and stagnation state points on a Tsdiagram. 12.81 Let us revisit the ramjet combustor in Problem 12.80. To more accurately model the ﬂow, we now include theeffects of friction in the duct. Once the effects of frictionhave been included, we ﬁnd that the conditions at state 2 are now M250.9,T251660/C14F, and p251.6 psia. Recalculate the heat transfer per pound of air between sections 1and 2, and the stagnation pressure at section 2. 12.82 Air passes through a normal shock in a supersonic wind tunnel. Upstream conditions are M151.8,T15270 K, and p1510.0 kPa (abs). Downstream conditions are M250.6165, T25413.6 K, and p2536.13 kPa (abs). (Four signiﬁcant ﬁgures are given to minimize roundoff errors.)Evaluate local isentropic stagnation conditions (a) upstreamfrom, and (b) downstream from, the normal shock. Calculate the change in speciﬁc entropy across the shock. Plot static and stagnation state points on a Tsdiagram. 12.83 Air enters a turbine at M150.4, T151250/C14C, and p15625 kPa (abs). Conditions leaving the turbine are M250.8,T25650/C14C, and p2520 kPa (abs). Evaluate local isentropic stagnation conditions (a) at the turbine inlet and(b) at the turbine outlet.

A window in the cockpit is located where the external ﬂow Mach number is 0.2 relative to the plane surface. The cabin is press urized to an equivalent altitude of 2500 m in a standard atmosphere. Estimate the pressure difference across the window. Be sure to specify the direction of the net pressure force. Critical Conditions 12.85 If a window of the cockpit in Problem 12.84 develops a tiny leak the air will start to rush out at critical speed. Findthe mass ﬂow rate if the leak area is 1 mm 12.86 Space debris impact is a real concern for spacecraft. If a piece of space debris were to create a hole of 0.001 in.2area in the hull of the International Space Station (ISS), at what rate would air leak from the ISS? Assume that the atmo- sphere in the International Space Station (ISS) is air at apressure of 14.7 psia and a temperature of 65 /C14F. 12.87 AC O 2cartridge is used to propel a toy rocket.

One of the earliest wind farms in the United States, the Altamont Pass WindFarm in central California, has almost 5000 relativelysmall wind turbines of various types, making it at onetime the largest farm in the world in terms of capacity.Altamont Pass is still the largest single concentration ofwind turbines in the world, with a capacity of 576 MW, producing about 125 MW on average and 1.1 TWh annually. Even though the turbines are quite large,technology has improved since they were installed inthe 1970s, and they are being gradually replaced withmuch larger and more cost-effective units. The smallerturbines are dangerous to various birds such as goldeneagles (about 70 of these are killed each year). The new, larger units turn more slowly and, being so much larger and higher, are less hazardous to the localwildlife. As we saw in the last Case Study in Energy and the Environment , a number of companies are developing small-scale alternatives to such wind farms. One suchcompany is Windspire Energy in Nevada. Its wind tur- bines, as shown in the photograph, are low-cost, low- noise, attractive-looking wind power generators for use 689In Chapter 12 we reviewed some basic concepts of compressible ﬂow. The main focus of this chapter is to discuss one-dimensional compressible ﬂow in more detail. The ﬁrst question we can ask is “What would cause the ﬂuid properties to vary in a one-dimensional compressible ﬂow?” The answer is that various phenomena can causechanges: /C15Flow with varying area (causing the velocity to change, and hence other property changes). /C15Normal shock (a “violent” adiabatic process that causes the entropy to increase, andhence other property changes). /C15Flow in a channel with friction (causing the entropy to increase, and hence otherproperty changes). /C15Flow in a channel with heating or cooling (causing a change in ﬂuid energy, andhence other property changes). For simplicity, we will study each of these phenomena separately (bearing in mindthat a real ﬂow is likely to experience several of them simultaneously). After com-pleting our treatment of one-dimensional ﬂow, we will introduce some basic conceptsof two-dimensional ﬂows: oblique shocks and expansion waves.with residential, business, and commercial buildings.Each Windspire can generate about 1.2 kW of electricity; for comparison, a typical home solar array can generateup to 3 kW in full, direct sunlight. Manufactured inMichigan, the Windspire wind turbines are 30 ft tall and 4 ft wide, propeller-free, vertical-axis wind turbine(VAWTs, discussed in Chapter 10). The Windspire tur- bines, in contrast to the Helix VAWT in Chapter 12, are lift devices; that is, the vertical blades are essentiallyairfoils generating lift (see Chapter 9) and hence torque.Windspires are currently powering over 500 homes, small businesses, schools, museums, parks, vineyards,and commercial buildings. Recently Adobe Systems Inc., makers of the com- monly used Adobe Acrobat, installed 20 Windspire wind turbines at its San Jose, California, campus. This is in keeping with Adobe’s leadership in green build- ing efforts; the headquarters is the ﬁrst commercialofﬁce building to receive the Leadership in Energy andEnvironmental Design (LEED-EB) Platinum certiﬁcationfor its headquarters. The new Windspires are located on Adobe’s sixth-ﬂoor patio, which doubles as arooftop garden and recreational area; the patio islocated between three ofﬁce towers, which create a wind tunnel effect from steady winds off the Paciﬁc Ocean. Adobe selected the Windspire for its powerful, sleek, quiet, and aesthetically pleasing design. Thetall, slender, delicate-looking cylinders look nothinglike the giant turbine blades turning above the Alta-mont Pass, but they generate power all the same! Sales of small turbines—those with a capacity of 100 kW or less—rose 78 percent in 2008; so the market is rapidly growing. Unlike the Windspire , most of the small turbines sold in the United States are horizontal-axis turbines (HAWTs). Windspire Energy believes that its VAWT Windspire has a number of advantages over HAWTs, including its much smallerfootprint, lower noise level, and aesthetic appeal. Windspire Turbines.

To do so, we will use the ﬁxed control volume shown in Fig. 13.1 . We initially assume that the ﬂow is affected by allof the phenomena mentioned above (i.e., area change, friction, and heat transfer—even the normal shock will be described by this approach).Then, for each individual phenomenon we will simplify the equations to obtain usefulresults. As shown in Fig. 13.1 , the properties at sections 1and 2are labeled with corre- sponding subscripts. Rxis the xcomponent of surface force from friction and pressure on the sides of the channel. There will also be surface forces from pressures at surfaces 1and 2. Note that the xcomponent of body force is zero, so it is not shown. _Qis the heat transfer. a.

This combination, h1V2=2, occurs often in compressible ﬂow, and is called the stagnation enthalpy ,h0. This is the enthalpy obtained if a ﬂow is brought adiabatically to rest. Hence, Eq. 13.1c can also be written δQ dm5h022h01 We see that heat transfer causes the stagnation enthalpy, and hence, stagnation temperature, T0, to change. d.

Equation of State Equations of state are relations among intensive thermodynamic properties. These relations may be available as tabulated data or charts, or as algebraic equations. Ingeneral, regardless of the format of the data, as we discussed in Chapter 12 (seeReferences [1 /C03] of that chapter), for a simple substance any property can be expressed as a function of any two other independent properties. For example, wecould write h5h(s,p), or ρ5ρ(s,p), and so on. We will primarily be concerned with ideal gases with constant speciﬁc heats, and for these we can write Eqs. 12.1 and 12.7b (renumbered for convenient use in this chapter), p5ρRT ð13:1eÞ and Δh5h 22h15cpΔT5cpðT22T1Þ ð13:1fÞ For ideal gases with constant speciﬁc heats, the change in entropy, Δs5s22s1, for any process can be computed from any of Eqs. 12.11.

Our task is now tosimplify this set of equations for each of the phenomena that can affect the ﬂow: /C15Flow with varying area. /C15Normal shock. /C15Flow in a channel with friction. /C15Flow in a channel with heating or cooling. 13.2 Isentropic Flow of an Ideal Gas: Area Variation The ﬁrst phenomenon is one in which the ﬂow is changed only by area variation— there is no heat transfer ( δQ=dm50) or friction (so that Rx, the xcomponent of surface force, results only from pressure on the sides of the channel), and there are noshocks. The absence of heat transfer, friction, and shocks (which are “violent” andtherefore inherently irreversible) means the ﬂow will be reversible and adiabatic, soEq. 13.1d becomes /C1mðs 22s1Þ5Z CS1 T_Q A ! dA50 or Δs5s22s150 so such a ﬂow is isentropic . This means that Eq. 13.1g leads to the result we saw in Chapter 12, T1pð12kÞ=k 15T2pð12kÞ=k 25Tpð12kÞ=k5constant ð12:12bÞ694 Chapter 13Compressible Flowor its equivalent (which can be obtained by using the ideal gas equation of state in Eq. 12.12b to eliminate temperature), p1 ρk 15p2 ρk 25p ρk5constant ð12:12cÞ Hence, the basic set of equations (Eqs. 13.1) becomes: ρ1V1A15ρ2V2A25ρVA5/C1m5constant ð13:2aÞ Rx1p1A12p2A25/C1mV 22/C1mV 1 ð13:2bÞ h015h11V2 1 25h21V2 2 25h025h0 ð13:2cÞ s25s15s ð13:2dÞ p5ρRT ð13:2eÞ Δh5h22h15cpΔT5cpðT22T1Þ ð13:2fÞ p1 ρk 15p2 ρk 25p ρk5constant ð13:2gÞ Note that Eqs. 13.2c, 13.2d, and 13.2f provide insight into how this process appears on anhsdiagram and on a Tsdiagram. From Eq. 13.2c, the total energy, or stagnation enthalpy h0, of the ﬂuid is constant; the enthalpy and kinetic energy may vary along the ﬂow, but their sum is constant. This means that if the ﬂuid accelerates, its tem-perature must decrease, and vice versa. Equation 13.2d indicates that the entropyremains constant. These results are shown for a typical process in Fig. 13.2 . Equation 13.2f indicates that the temperature and enthalpy are linearly related; hence, processes plotted on a Tsdiagram will look very similar to that shown in Fig. 13.2 except for the vertical scale. Equations 13.2 could be used to analyze isentropic ﬂow in a channel of varying area. For example, if we know conditions at section 1(i.e., p1,ρ1,T1,s1,h1,V1, and A1) we could use these equations to ﬁnd conditions at some new section 2where the area is A2: We would have seven equations and seven unknowns ( p2,ρ2,T2,s2,h2,V2, and, if desired, the net pressure force on the walls Rx). We stress could , because in practice this procedure is unwieldy—we have a set of seven nonlinear coupled alge- braic equations to solve (however, we will see, for example in Example 13.1, that Excel can be used to solve this set of equations). Instead we will usually use some of these equations as convenient but also take advantage of the results we obtained forisentropic ﬂows in Chapter 12, and develop property relations in terms of the localMach number, the stagnation conditions, and critical conditions. h sh0 h1 h2Reference state Kineticenergy ofstateStatep = const 11 Thermalenergy ofstate 1 State 2Kineticenergy ofstate 2 Thermalenergy ofstate 2Totalenergyh 0 of all states Fig. 13.2 Isentropic ﬂow in the hsplane.13.2 Isentropic Flow of an Ideal Gas: Area Variation 695Before proceeding with this approach, we can gain insight into the isentropic process by reviewing the results we obtained in Chapter 12 when we analyzed a dif- ferential control volume (Fig. 12.5 ). The momentum equation for this was dp ρ1dV2 2/C18/C19 50 ð12:20bÞ (Note that we could also have obtained this equation using our set of equations, Eqs.13.1. If we applied Eqs. 13.1 to a differential control volume, we could replace ρ 1,V1, andA1with ρ,V,a n dA , and ρ2,V2, and A2with ρ1dρ,V1dV, and A1dA. Then Eq. 13.1a and 13.1b simplify to the above equation.) Then dp52ρVd V Dividing by ρV2, we obtain dp ρV252dV Vð13:3Þ A convenient differential form of the continuity equation can be obtained from Eq. 13.2a, in the form ρAV5constant Differentiating and dividing by ρAVyields dρ ρ1dA A1dV V50 ð13:4Þ Solving Eq. 13.4 for dA/Agives dA A52dV V2dρ ρ Substituting from Eq. 13.3 gives dA A5dp ρV22dρ ρ or dA A5dp ρV212V2 dp=dρ/C20/C21 Now recall that for an isentropic process, dp=dρ5@p=@ρÞs5c2,s o dA A5dp ρV212V2 c2/C20/C21 5dp ρV2½12M2/C138 or dp ρV25dA A1 ½12M2/C138ð13:5Þ Substituting from Eq. 13.3 into Eq. 13.5, we obtain dV V52dA A1 ½12M2/C138ð13:6Þ696 Chapter 13Compressible FlowNote that for an isentropic ﬂow there can be no friction. Equations 13.5 and 13.6 conﬁrm that for this case, from a momentum point of view we expect an increase inpressure to cause a decrease in speed, and vice versa. Although we cannot use them for computations (we have not so far determined how Mvaries with A), Eqs. 13.5 and 13.6 give us very interesting insights into how the pressure and velocity change as we change the area of the ﬂow. Three possibilities are discussed below. Subsonic Flow, M,1 ForM,1, the factor 1/[1 2M2] in Eqs. 13.5 and 13.6 is positive, so that a positive dA leads to a positive dpand a negative dV. These mathematical results mean that in a divergent section ( dA.0) the ﬂow must experience an increase in pressure ( dp.0) and the velocity must decrease (dV,0). Hence a divergent channel is a subsonic diffuser (a diffuser is a device that decelerates a ﬂow). On the other hand, a negative dAleads to a negative dpand a positive dV.T h e s e mathematical results mean that in a convergent section ( dA,0) the ﬂow must experience a decrease in pressure ( dp,0) and the velocity must increase (dV.0). Hence a convergent channel is a subsonic nozzle (a nozzle is a device that accel- erates a ﬂow). These results are consistent with our everyday experience and are not surprising— for example, recall the venturi meter in Chapter 8, in which a reduction in area at thethroat of the venturi led to a local increase in velocity, and because of the Bernoulliprinciple, to a pressure drop, and the divergent section led to pressure recovery andﬂow deceleration. (The Bernoulli principle assumes incompressible ﬂow, which is thelimiting case of subsonic ﬂow.) The subsonic diffuser and nozzle are also shown in Fig. 13.3 . Supersonic Flow, M.1 ForM.1, the factor 1/[1 2M2] in Eqs. 13.5 and 13.6 is negative, so that a positive dA leads to a negative dpand a positive dV. These mathematical results mean that in a divergent section ( dA.0) the ﬂow must experience a decrease in pressure ( dp,0) and the velocity must increase (dV.0). Hence a divergent channel is a supersonic nozzle .

These mathematical results mean that in a convergent section ( dA,0) the ﬂow must experience an increase in pressure ( dp.0) and the velocity must decrease (dV,0). Hence a convergent channel is a supersonic diffuser . These results are inconsistent with our everyday experience and are at ﬁrst a bit surprising—they are the opposite of what we saw in the venturi meter! The results are consistent with the laws of physics; for example, an increase in pressure must lead to aﬂow deceleration because pressure forces are the only forces acting. The supersonic nozzle and diffuser are shown in Fig. 13.3 . These somewhat counterintuitive results can be understood when we realize that we are used to assuming that ρ5constant, but we are now in a ﬂow regime where the ﬂuid density is a sensitive function of ﬂow conditions. From Eq. 13.4, dV V52dA A2dρ ρ For example, in a supersonic diverging ﬂow ( dApositive) the ﬂow actually accelerates (dValso positive) because the density drops sharply ( dρis negative and large, with the net result that the right side of the equation is positive). We can see examples ofsupersonic diverging nozzles in the space shuttle main engines, each of which has anozzle about 10 ft long with an 8 ft exit diameter. The maximum thrust is obtainedfrom the engines when the combustion gases exit at the highest possible speed, whichthe nozzles achieve. Sonic Flow, M51 As we approach M51, from either a subsonic or supersonic state, the factor 1=½12M2/C138in Eqs. 13.5 and 13.6 approaches inﬁnity, implying that the pressure and velocity changes also approach inﬁnity. This is obviously unrealistic, so we must lookfor some other way for the equations to make physical sense. The only way we canavoid these singularities in pressure and velocity is if we require that dA-0a sM-1. Hence, for an isentropic ﬂow, sonic conditions can only occur where the area isconstant! We can be even more speciﬁc: We can imagine approaching M51 from either a subsonic or a supersonic state. A subsonic ﬂow ( M,1) would need to be accelerated using a subsonic nozzle, which we have learned is a converging section; asupersonic ﬂow ( M.1) would need to be decelerated using a supersonic diffuser, which is also a converging section. Hence, sonic conditions are limited not just to alocation of constant area, but one that is a minimum area. The important result is thatfor isentropic ﬂow the sonic condition M 51 can only be attained at a throat, or section of minimum area . (This does notmean that a throat must have M51. After all, we may have a low speed ﬂow or even no ﬂow at all in the device!). We can see that to isentropically accelerate a ﬂuid from rest to supersonic speed we would need to have a subsonic nozzle (converging section) followed by a supersonicnozzle (diverging section), with M51 at the throat. This device is called a converging- diverging nozzle (C-D nozzle). Of course, to create a supersonic ﬂow we need more than just a C-D nozzle: We must also generate and maintain a pressure difference betweenthe inlet and exit. We will discuss shortly C-D nozzles in some detail, and the pressuresrequired to accomplish a change from subsonic to supersonic ﬂow. We must be careful in our discussion of isentropic ﬂow (especially deceleration), because real ﬂuids can experience nonisentropic phenomena such as boundary-layerseparation and shock waves. In practice, supersonic ﬂow cannot be decelerated toexactly M51 at a throat because sonic ﬂow near a throat is unstable in a rising (adverse) pressure gradient. (It turns out that disturbances that are always present in areal subsonic ﬂow propagate upstream, disturbing the sonic ﬂow at the throat, causing698 Chapter 13Compressible Flowshock waves to form and travel upstream, where they may be disgorged from the inlet of the supersonic diffuser.) The throat area of a real supersonic diffuser must be slightly larger than that required to reduce the ﬂow to M51. Under the proper downstream conditions, a weak normal shock forms in the diverging channel just downstream from the throat.Flow leaving the shock is subsonic and decelerates in the diverging channel. Thusdeceleration from supersonic to subsonic ﬂow cannot occur isentropically in practice,since the weak normal shock causes an entropy increase. Normal shocks will beanalyzed in Section 13.3. For accelerating ﬂows (favorable pressure gradients), the idealization of isentropic ﬂow is generally a realistic model of the actual ﬂow behavior. For decelerating ﬂows, the idealization of isentropic ﬂow may not be realistic because of the adverse pressure gradients and the attendant possibility of ﬂow separation, as discussed for incom-pressible boundary-layer ﬂow in Chapter 9. Reference Stagnation and Critical Conditions for Isentropic Flow of an Ideal Gas As we mentioned at the beginning of this section, in principle we could use Eqs. 13.2 to analyze one-dimensional isentropic ﬂow of an ideal gas, but the computations would be somewhat tedious. Instead, because the ﬂow is isentropic, we can use theresults of Sections 12.3 (reference stagnation conditions) and 12.4 (reference criticalconditions). The idea is illustrated in Fig. 13.4 : Instead of using Eqs. 13.2 to compute, for example, properties at state 2from those at state 1, we can use state 1to determine two reference states (the stagnation state and the critical state), and thenuse these to obtain properties at state We need two reference states because the reference stagnation state does not provide area information (mathematically the stagnation area is inﬁnite). We will use Eqs. 12.21 (renumbered for convenience), p0 p511k21 2M2/C20/C21k=ðk21Þ ð13:7aÞ T0 T511k21 2M2ð13:7bÞ ρ0 ρ511k21 2M2/C20/C211=ðk21Þ ð13:7cÞ Reference stagnation state Reference critical stateStateT0 T1 T2 T*T s1State to stagnation state to state 1 State 22 State to critical state to state 1 2 Fig. 13.4 Example of stagnation and critical reference states in the Tsplane.13.2 Isentropic Flow of an Ideal Gas: Area Variation 699We note that the stagnation conditions are constant throughout the isentropic ﬂow .

Equations 13.7a, 13.7b, and 13.7c relate local properties ( p,ρ,T, and V) to stagnation properties ( p0,ρ0,a n dT 0) via the Mach number M, and Eqs. 12.22 and 12.23 relate critical properties ( p*,ρ*,T*, and V*) to stagnation properties ( p0,ρ0, and T0) respectively, but we have yet to obtain a relation between areas AandA*.

It is a good idea to program them if your calculator does not already have them. There are even interactive Web sitesthat make them available (see, for example, [2]), and they are fairly easy to deﬁne in spreadsheets such as Excel . The reader is urged to download the Excel add-ins for these equations from the Web site; with the add-ins, functions are available for computing pressure, temperature, density or area ratios from M,a n d Mfrom the ratios. While they are somewhat complicated algebraically, they have the advantage over the basic equa-tions, Eq. 13.2, that they are not coupled. Each property can be found directly from itsstagnation value and the Mach number. Equation 13.7d shows the relation between Machnumber Mand area A. The critical area A* (deﬁned whether or not a given ﬂow ever attains sonic conditions) is used to normalize area A. For each Mach number Mwe obtain a unique area ratio, but as shown in Fig 13.5 each A/A* ratio (except 1) has two possible Mach numbers—one subsonic, the other supersonic. The shape shown in Fig. 13.5 looks like a converging-diverging section for accelerating from a subsonic to a supersonic ﬂow (with, as necessary, M51 only at the throat), but in practice this is not the shape to which such a passage would be built. For example, the diverging section usually will have a much less severe angle of divergence to reduce the chance of ﬂow separation (in Fig. 13.5 the Mach number increases linearly, but this is not necessary). Appendix E.1 lists ﬂow functions for property ratios T 0/T,p0/p,ρ0/ρ, and A/A*i n terms of Mfor isentropic ﬂow of an ideal gas. A table of values, as well as a plot of these property ratios, is presented for air ( k51.4) for a limited range of Mach numbers. The associated Excel workbook, Isentropic Relations, can be used to print a larger table of values for air and other ideal gases. Example 13.1 demonstrates use of some of the above equations. As shown in Fig. 13.4 , we can use the equations to relate a property at one state to the stagnation value and then from the stagnation value to a second state, but note that we can accomplish this in onestep—for example, p 2can be obtained from p1by writing p25ðp2=p0Þðp0=p1Þp1, where the pressure ratios come from Eq. 13.7a evaluated at the two Mach numbers.3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 Mach number, M1.0 0.5 000.51.01.52.02.53.0Area ratio,A__ A* Fig. 13.5 Variation of A/A* with Mach number for isentropic ﬂow of an ideal gas with k51.4.13.2 Isentropic Flow of an Ideal Gas: Area Variation 701Example 13.1 ISENTROPIC FLOW IN A CONVERGING CHANNEL Air ﬂows isentropically in a channel. At section 1, the Mach number is 0.3, the area is 0.001m2, and the absolute pressure and the temperature are 650 kPa and 62/C14C, respectively. At section 2, the Mach number is 0.8. Sketch the channel shape, plot a Tsdiagram for the process, and evaluate properties at section 2. Verify that the results agree with the basic equations, Eqs. 13.2. Given: Isentropic ﬂow of air in a channel. At sections 1and 2, the following data are given: M150.3,T1562/C14C,p15650 kPa (abs), A150.001 m2, and M250.8. Find: (a) The channel shape.

Consequently, the stagnation temperature at section 2can be calculated (for air, k51.4) from Eq. 13.7b.

We ﬁrstlook at the converging nozzle, and then the C-D nozzle. In either case, to produce a ﬂow we must provide a pressure difference. For example, as illustrated in the con- verging nozzle shown in Fig. 13.6 a, we can do this by providing the gas from a reservoir (or “plenum chamber”) at p 0and T0, and using a vacuum pump/valve/C1m56:76kg m33110m s30:001 m255:24kg m33279m s30:00051 m250:744 kg =s ðCheck!

We are interested in what happens to the gas properties as the gas ﬂows through the nozzle, and also in knowing how the mass ﬂow rate increases as we progressively lower the back pressure.(We could also produce a ﬂow by maintaining a constant back pressure, e.g., atmo-spheric, and increasing the pressure in the plenum chamber.) Let us call the pressure at the exit plane p e. We will see that this will often be equal to the applied back pressure, pb, but not always! The results we obtain as we pro- gressively open the valve from a closed position are shown in Figs. 13.6 band 13.6 c. We consider each of the cases shown. When the valve is closed, there is no ﬂow through the nozzle. The pressure is p0 throughout, as shown by condition ( i) in Fig. 13.6 a. If the back pressure, pb, is now reduced to slightly less than p0, there will be ﬂow through the nozzle with a decrease in pressure in the direction of ﬂow, as shown bycondition ( ii). Flow at the exit plane will be subsonic with the exit-plane pressure equal to the back pressure. What happens as we continue to decrease the back pressure? As expected, the ﬂow rate will continue to increase, and the exit-plane pressure will continue to decrease, asshown by condition ( iii) in Fig. 13.6 a. [Note that conditions ( ii)a n d( iii) can be described using the Bernoulli equation (Eq. 6.8), as long as the maximum Machnumber, at the exit plane, does not exceed M50.3.] As we progressively lower the back pressure the ﬂow rate increases, and hence, so do the velocity and Mach number at the exit plane. The question arises: “Is there a limit to the mass ﬂow rate through the nozzle?” or, to put it another way, “Is there an upper limit on the exit Mach number?” The answer to these questions is “Yes!” Tosee this, recall that for isentropic ﬂow Eq. 13.6 applies: dV V52dA A1 12M2 ½/C138ð13:6Þ From this we learned that the onlyplace we can have sonic conditions ( M51) is where the change in area dAis zero. We cannot have sonic conditions anywhere in the converging section. Logically we can see that the maximum exit Mach number is one . Because the ﬂow started from rest ( M50), if we had M.1 at the exit, we would have had to pass through M51 somewhere in the converging section, which would be a violation of Eq. 13.6. Hence, the maximum ﬂow rate occurs when we have sonic conditions at the exit plane, when Me51, and pe5pb5p*, the critical pressure. This is shown as condition (iv) in Fig. 13.6 a, and is called a “choked ﬂow,” beyond which the ﬂow rate cannot be increased.

For example, if we wish to have sonic ﬂow at the exit of a nozzle from a plenum chamber that is at atmospheric pressure, we would need to maintain a back pressure of about 7.76 psia, or about 6.94 psig vacuum. Thisdoes not sound difﬁcult for a vacuum pump to generate, but actually takes a lot ofpower to maintain, because we will have a large mass ﬂow rate through the pump. Forthe maximum, or choked, mass ﬂow rate we have /C1m choked5ρ*V*A* Using the ideal gas equation of state, Eq. 13.2e, and the stagnation to critical pressure andtemperature ratios, Eqs. 13.7a and 13.7b respectively, with M51 (or Eqs. 12.21a and 12.21b, respectively), with A*5A e, it can be shown that this becomes /C1mchoked5Aep0ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ k RT0s 2 k11/C18/C19ðk11Þ=2ðk21Þ ð13:9aÞ Note that for a given gas ( kandR), the maximum ﬂow rate in the converging nozzle depends only o nt h es i z eo ft h ee x i ta r e a( Ae) and the conditions in the reservoir ( p0,T0). For air, for convenience we write an “engineering” form of Eq. 13.9a, /C1mchoked50:04Aep0ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃT0p ð13:9bÞ with/C1mchoked in kg/s, Aein m2,p0in Pa, and T0in K, and /C1mchoked576:6Aep0ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃT 0p ð13:9cÞ with/C1mchoked in lbm/s, Aein ft2,p0in psia, and T0inoR. Suppose we now insist on lowering the back pressure below this “benchmark” level ofp*. Our next question is “What will happen to the ﬂow in the nozzle?” The answer is “Nothing!” The ﬂow remains choked: The mass ﬂow rate does not increase, as shown in Fig. 13.6 b, and the pressure distribution in the nozzle remains unchanged, with pe5p*.pb, as shown in condition ( v) in Figs. 13.6 aand 13.6 c. After exiting, the ﬂow adjusts down to the applied back pressure, but does so in a nonisentropic, three-dimensional manner in a series of expansion waves and shocks, and for this part of theﬂow our one-dimensional, isentropic ﬂow concepts no longer apply. We will return tothis discussion in Section 13.4. This idea of choked ﬂow seems a bit strange, but can be explained in at least two ways. First, we have already discussed that to increase the mass ﬂow rate beyondchoked would require M e.1, which is not possible. Second, once the ﬂow reaches sonic conditions, it becomes “deaf” to downstream conditions: Any change (i.e., areduction) in the applied back pressure propagates in the ﬂuid at the speed of sound inall directions, as we discussed in Chapter 12, so it gets “washed” downstream by theﬂuid which is moving at the speed of sound at the nozzle exit. Flow through a converging nozzle may be divided into two regimes: 1.In Regime I, 1 $p b=p0$p*=p0. Flow to the throat is isentropic and pe5pb. 2.In Regime II, pb=p0,p*=p0. Flow to the throat is isentropic, and Me51. A nonisentropic expansion occurs in the ﬂow leaving the nozzle and pe5p*.pb (entropy increases because this is adiabatic but irreversible).706 Chapter 13Compressible FlowThe ﬂow processes corresponding to Regime II are shown on a Tsdiagram in Fig. 13.7 . Two problems involving converging nozzles are solved in Examples 13.2 and 13.3. Although isentropic ﬂow is an idealization, it often is a very good approximation for the actual behavior of nozzles. Since a nozzle is a device that accelerates a ﬂow, the internal pressure gradient is favorable. This tends to keep the wall boundary layersthin and to minimize the effects of friction.T* s /HS11005 constantNozzle exit planep*s = constant pb < p*T0p0 sT Fig. 13.7 Schematic Ts diagram for choked ﬂow through a converging nozzle.

As for the converging nozzle, we wish to see, among other things, how the ﬂow rate varies with the driving force, the applied pressure difference ( p02pb). Consider the effect of gradually reducing the back pressure. The results are illustrated graphically inFig. 13.8. Let us consider each of the cases shown. With the valve initially closed, there is no ﬂow through the nozzle; the pressure is constant at p Opening the valve slightly ( pbslightly less than p0) produces pressure distribution curve ( i). If the ﬂow rate is low enough, the ﬂow will be subsonic and essentially incompressible at all points on this curve. Under these conditions, the C-Dnozzle will behave as a venturi, with ﬂow accelerating in the converging portion until apoint of maximum velocity and minimum pressure is reached at the throat, then decelerating in the diverging portion to the nozzle exit. (This behavior is described accurately by the Bernoulli equation, Eq. 6.8.) As the valve is opened farther and the ﬂow rate is increased, a more sharply deﬁned pressure minimum occurs, as shown by curve ( ii). Although compressibility effects become important, the ﬂow is still subsonic everywhere, and ﬂow decelerates in the diverging section. (Clearly, this behavior is notdescribed accurately by the Bernoulli equation.) Finally, as the valve is opened farther, curve ( iii)r e s u l t s .A t the section of minimum area the ﬂow ﬁnally reaches M51, and the nozzle is choked—the ﬂow rate is the maximum possible for the given nozzle and stagnationconditions. All ﬂows with pressure distributions ( i), (ii), and ( iii) are isentropic; as we progress from ( i)t o( ii)t o( iii) we are generating increasing mass ﬂow rates. Finally, when curve ( iii) is reached, critical conditions are present at the throat. For this ﬂow rate, the ﬂow is choked, and /C1m5ρ*V*A* where A*5A t, just as it was for the converging nozzle, and for this maximum possible ﬂow rate Eq. 13.9a applies (with Aereplaced with the throat area At), /C1mchoked5Atp0ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ k RT0s 2 k11/C18/C19ðk11Þ=2ðk21Þ ð13:10aÞ Note that for a given gas ( kandR), the maximum ﬂow rate in the C-D nozzle depends only on the size of the throat area ( At) and the conditions in the reservoir ( p0,T0). pb pe ValveTo vacuum pump tT0 p0 V0 0≅ 1.0 p/p0 p*___p0 Throat Exit planexiii iv viii Me < 1 Me > 1M = 1Flow Fig. 13.8 Pressure distributions for isentropic ﬂow in a converging-diverging nozzle.710 Chapter 13Compressible FlowFor air, for convenience we write an “engineering” form of Eq. 13.10a, /C1mchoked50:04Atp0ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃT0p ð13:10bÞ with/C1mchoked in kg/s, Atin m2,p0in Pa, and T0in K, and /C1mchoked576:6Atp0ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃT 0p ð13:10cÞ with/C1mchoked in lbm/s, Atin ft2,p0in psia, and T0in/C14R. Any attempt to increase the ﬂow rate by further lowering the back pressure will fail, for the two reasons we discussed earlier: once we attain sonic conditions, downstream changes can no longer be transmitted upstream; and we cannot exceedsonic conditions at the throat, because this would require passing through the sonicstate somewhere in the converging section, which is not possible in isentropic ﬂow.(Of course, we could increase the choked mass ﬂow rate through a given C-D nozzle to any level desired by, for example, increasing the reservoir pressure.) With sonic conditions at the throat, we consider what canhappen to the ﬂow in the diverging section. We have previously discussed (see Fig. 13.3 ) that a diverging section will decelerate a subsonic ﬂow ( M,1) but will accelerate a supersonic ﬂow ( M.1)— very different behaviors! The question arises: “Does a sonic ﬂow behave as a subsonic oras a supersonic ﬂow as it enters a diverging section?” The answer to this question is that it can behave like either one, depending on the downstream pressure! We have already seen subsonic ﬂow behavior [curve ( iii)]: the applied back pressure leads to a gradual downstream pressure increase, decelerating the ﬂow. We now consider accelerating the choked ﬂow. To accelerate ﬂow in the diverging section requires a pressure decrease. This con- dition is illustrated by curve ( iv) in Fig. 13.8 . The ﬂow will accelerate isentropically in the nozzle provided the exit pressure is set at p iv. Thus, we see that with a throat Mach number of unity, there are two possible isentropic ﬂow conditions in the converging- diverging nozzle. This is consistent with the results of Fig. 13.5, where we found twoMach numbers for each A/A* in isentropic ﬂow. Lowering the back pressure below condition ( iv), say to condition ( v), has no effect on ﬂow in the nozzle. The ﬂow is isentropic from the plenum chamber to the nozzleexit [as in condition ( iv)] and then it undergoes a three-dimensional irreversible expansion to the lower back pressure. A nozzle operating under these conditions issaid to be underexpanded, since additional expansion takes place outside the nozzle. A converging-diverging nozzle generally is intended to produce supersonic ﬂow at the exit plane. If the back pressure is set at p iv, ﬂow will be isentropic through the nozzle, and supersonic at the nozzle exit. Nozzles operating at pb5piv[corresponding to curve ( iv) in Fig. 13.8 ] are said to operate at design conditions . Flow leaving a C-D nozzle is supersonic when the back pressure is at or below nozzle design pressure. The exit Mach number is ﬁxed once the area ratio, Ae/A*, is speciﬁed. All other exit plane properties (for isentropic ﬂow) are uniquely related tostagnation properties by the ﬁxed exit plane Mach number. The assumption of isentropic ﬂow for a real nozzle at design conditions is a rea- sonable one. However, the one-dimensional ﬂow model is inadequate for the design ofrelatively short nozzles to produce uniform supersonic exit ﬂow. Rocket-propelled vehicles use C-D nozzles to accelerate the exhaust gases to the maximum possible speed to produce high thrust. A propulsion nozzle is subject tovarying ambient conditions during ﬂight through the atmosphere, so it is impossible toattain the maximum theoretical thrust over the complete operating range. Becauseonly a single supersonic Mach number can be obtained for each area ratio, nozzles for13.2 Isentropic Flow of an Ideal Gas: Area Variation 711developing supersonic ﬂow in wind tunnels often are built with interchangeable test sections, or with variable geometry. You probably have noticed that nothing has been said about the operation of converging-diverging nozzles with back pressure in the range piii.pb.piv. For such cases the ﬂow cannot expand isentropically to pb. Under these conditions a shock (which may be treated as an irreversible discontinuity involving entropy increase)occurs somewhere within the ﬂow. Following a discussion of normal shocks in Section13.3, we shall return to complete the discussion of converging-diverging nozzle ﬂowsin Section 13.4. Nozzles operating with p iii.pb.pivare said to be overexpanded because the pressure at some point in the nozzle is less than the back pressure. Obviously, an overexpanded nozzle could be made to operate at a new design condition by removing a portion of the diverging section. In Example 13.4, we consider isentropic ﬂow in a C-D nozzle; in Example 13.5, we consider choked ﬂow in a C-D nozzle. Example 13.4 ISENTROPIC FLOW IN A CONVERGING-DIVERGING NOZZLE Air ﬂows isentropically in a converging-diverging nozzle, with exit area of 0.001 m2.

In real channels, we will have friction and quite possibly heat transfer. We need to study the effects of these phenomena on a ﬂow. Before this, in the next section, we study the effect of normal shocks (and see in Section 13.4 how these affect the C-D nozzle, in more detail than we did in this section). 13.3 Normal Shocks We mentioned normal shocks in the previous section in the context of ﬂow through anozzle. In practice, these irreversible discontinuities can occur in any supersonic ﬂow ﬁeld, in either internal ﬂow or external ﬂow. Knowledge of property changes across shocks and of shock behavior is important in understanding the design of supersonicdiffusers, e.g., for inlets on high performance aircraft, and supersonic wind tunnels.Accordingly, the purpose of this section is to analyze the normal shock process. Before applying the basic equations to normal shocks, it is important to form a clear physical picture of the shock itself. Although it is physically impossible to havediscontinuities in ﬂuid properties, the normal shock is nearly discontinuous. Thethickness of a shock is about 0.2 μm (10 25in.), or roughly 4 times the mean free path of the gas molecules [3]. Large changes in pressure, temperature, and other propertiesoccur across this small distance. Fluid particle decelerations through the shock reachtens of millions of gs! These considerations justify treating the normal shock as an abrupt discontinuity; we are interested in changes occurring across the shock ratherthan in the details of its structure. Consider the short control volume surrounding a normal shock standing in a pas- sage of arbitrary shape shown in Fig. 13.9 . As for isentropic ﬂow with area variation (Section 13.2), our starting point in analyzing this normal shock is the set of basic equations (Eqs. 13.1), describing one-dimensional motion that may be affected by several phenomena: area change, friction, and heat transfer. These are ρ 1V1A15ρ2V2A25ρVA5/C1m5constant ð13:1aÞ Rx1p1A12p2A25/C1mV 22/C1mV 1 ð13:1bÞ δQ dm1h11V2 1 25h21V2 2 2ð13:1cÞ /C1mðs22s1Þ$Z CS1 T_Q A ! dA ð13:1dÞ p5ρRT ð13:1eÞ Δh5h22h15cpΔT5cpðT22T1Þ ð13:1fÞ CLASSIC VIDEO Channel Flow of a Compressible Fluid .

We must simplify these equations for ﬂow through a normal shock. Basic Equations for a Normal Shock We can now simplify Eqs. 13.1 for ﬂow of an ideal gas with constant speciﬁc heats through a normal shock. The most important simplifying feature is that the widthof the control volume is inﬁnitesimal (in reality about 0.2 μm as we indicated), so A 1/C25A2/C25A, the force due to the walls Rx/C250 (because the control volume wall surface area is inﬁnitesimal), and the heat exchange with the walls δQ/dm/C250, for the same reason. Hence, for this ﬂow our equations become ρ1V15ρ2V25/C1m A5constant ð13:11aÞ p1A2p2A5/C1mV 22/C1mV 1 or, using Eq. 13.11a, p11ρ1V2 15p21ρ2V2 2 ð13:11bÞ h015h11V2 1 25h21V2 2 25h02ð13:11cÞ s2.s1 ð13:11dÞ p5ρRT ð13:11eÞ Δh5h22h15cpΔT5cpðT22T1Þ ð13:11fÞ Δs5s22s15cplnT2 T12Rlnp2 p1ð13:11gÞ Equations 13.11 can be used to analyze ﬂow through a normal shock. For example, ifwe know conditions before the shock, at section 1(i.e., p1,ρ1,T1,s1,h1, and V1), we can use these equations to ﬁnd conditions after the shock, at section 2. We have six equations (not including the constraint of Eq. 13.11d) and six unknowns ( p2,ρ2,T2,s2, h2,a n d V2). Hence, for given upstream conditions there is a single unique downstream state. In practice this procedure is unwieldy—we have a set of nonlinear coupled algebraic equations to solve. We can certainly use these equations for analyzing normal shocks, but we will usually ﬁnd it more useful to develop normal shock functions based on M1, the upstream Mach number. Before doing this, let us consider the set of equations. Wehave stated in this chapter that changes in a one-dimensional ﬂow can be causedby area variation, friction, or heat transfer, but in deriving Eqs. 13.11 we haveeliminated all three causes! In this case, then, what is causing the ﬂow to change? Perhaps there are no changes through a normal shock! Indeed, if we examine each of these equations we see that each one is satisﬁed—has a possible “solution”—if all716 Chapter 13Compressible Flowproperties at location 2are equal to the corresponding properties at location 1(e.g., p25p1,T25T1)except for Eq. 13.11d, which expresses the second law of thermo- dynamics. Nature is telling us that in the absence of area change, friction, and heat transfer, ﬂow properties will not change except in a very abrupt, irreversible manner, for which the entropy increases. In fact, all properties except T0dochange through the shock. We must ﬁnd a solution in which allof Eqs. 13.11 are satisﬁed. (Incidentally, because all the equations except Eq. 13.11d are satisﬁed by p25p1,T25T1, and so on, numerical searching methods such as Excel ‘sSolver have some difﬁculty in ﬁnding the correct solution!) Because they are a set of nonlinear coupl ed equations, it is difﬁcult to use Eqs. 13.11 to see exactly what happens through a normal shock. We will postponeformal proof of the results we are about to present until a subsequent subsection, where we recast the equations in terms of the incoming Mach number. This r e c a s t i n gi sr a t h e rm a t h e m a t i c a l ,s ow e present results of the analysis here for clarity. It turns out that a normal shock can occur only when the incoming ﬂow issupersonic. Fluid ﬂows will generally gradually adjust to downstream conditions(e.g., an obstacle in the ﬂow) as the pressure ﬁeld redirects the ﬂow (e.g., aroundthe object). However, if the ﬂow is moving at such a speed that the pressure ﬁeldcannot propagate upstream (when the ﬂow speed, V, is greater than the local speed of sound, c,o ri no t h e rw o r d s M.1), then the ﬂuid has to “violently” adjust to the downstream conditions. The shock that a supersonic ﬂow may encounter is like ahammer blow that each ﬂuid particle exper iences; the pressure suddenly increases through the shock (as mentioned, over a distance ,2μm), so that, at the instant a particle is passing through the shock, th ere is a very large negative pressure gra- dient. This pressure gradient causes a dramatic reduction in speed, V, and hence a r a p i dr i s ei nt e m p e r a t u r e , T, as kinetic energy is converted to internal thermal energy. We may wonder what happens to the d ensity because both the temperature and pressure rise through the shock, leading to opposing changes in density; it turnsout that the density, ρ, increases through the shock. Because the shock is adiabatic but highly irreversible, entropy, s, increases through the shock. Finally, we see that as speed, V, decreases and the speed of sound, c, increases (because temperature, T, increases) through the normal shock, the Mach number, M, decreases; in fact, we will see later that it always becomes subsonic. These results are shown graph-ically in Fig. 13.10 and in tabular form in Table 13.1. 12 12 Flow T1T2p2 p1Shockp01p02 T01 = T02s2 – s1T s Fig. 13.10 Schematic of normal-shock process on the Tsplane.13.3 Normal Shocks 717Fanno and Rayleigh Interpretation of Normal Shock A normal shock is a phenomenon in which ﬂuid properties experience large changes over a very short distance and time; we are very far from equilibrium conditions! It isnot easy to see what is happening in such a dramatic process. However, we can gainsome insight by considering two processes in which ﬂow properties are graduallychanging: during a process involving friction and during a heat transfer process. HenceEqs. 13.11 can be understood to some degree by considering Fanno-line (friction) and Rayleigh-line (heat transfer) curves. You may wish to postpone reading this subsec- tion until these curves are discussed in much more detail in Sections 13.5 and 13.6, but the following discussion brieﬂy and sufﬁciently describes them; they are shown schematically in Fig. 13.11 . Both curves comply with our ubiquitous Eqs. 13.1. In aTsdiagram, the Fanno line curve shows all possible states for a one-dimensional ﬂow that is being changed only by friction (there is no area change and no heat transfer). The second law of thermodynamics requires that in this case entropy must increase, sothat, as seen in Fig. 13.11 , if the ﬂow starts out subsonic, friction causes the ﬂow to accelerate until it becomes sonic; a ﬂow that starts out supersonic decelerates until itis sonic. We will see in Section 13.5 that the curve is generated from Eqs. 13.1. (It is counterintuitive that friction can accelerate a ﬂow, but it can happen if the pressureTable 13.1 Summary of Property Changes Across a Normal Shock Property Effect Obtained from: Stagnation temperature T05Constant Energy equation Entropy s Second law Stagnation pressure p0 Tsdiagram Temperature T Tsdiagram Velocity V Energy equation, and effect on T Density ρ Continuity equation, and effect on V Pressure p Momentum equation, and effect on V Mach number M M5V/c, and effects on VandT 2 1ShockFanno line M /H11005 1M /H11005 1 M /H11021 1 M /H11021 1 M /H11022 1 M /H11022 1Rayleigh lineT s Fig. 13.11 Intersection of Fanno line and Rayleigh line as a solution of the normal-shock equations.718 Chapter 13Compressible Flowis falling sufﬁciently rapidly). We will wait until Section 13.5 to discuss what happens if friction continues after we reach sonic conditions! All such friction ﬂows must move inthe direction of increasing entropy. The Rayleigh line shows all possible states for a one-dimensional ﬂow that is experiencing only heat transfer (no area changes or friction). Heat addition corre- sponds to an increase in both entropy and temperature (except for a small region nearM51), and both sub- and supersonic ﬂows approach sonic conditions; a cooling process leads to reductions in temperature and entropy. We will see in Section 13.6that the curve is generated from Eqs. 13.1. The normal shock is obtained from a superposition of the two curves, as shown. States 1and 2are the beginning and end states of a ﬂow that (following the Fanno line) has only friction present (no area changes or heat transfer); they are also the beginning and end states of a ﬂow that (following the Rayleigh curve) has only heat transfer (no area changes or friction). This raises the question of how we can have a ﬂowwith simultaneously only friction and only heat transfer! The answer is that we math- ematically can follow the Fanno line from 1to 2, although not in reality. We could actually have a ﬂow in which we had friction from state 1to where M51, but from M51t os t a t e 2we would have to have “negative friction” (recall that friction requires us to increase the entropy). Hence, from state 1to state 2, we have a ﬁctitious process in which we have friction, then negative friction, ending in no net friction. A similarprocess applies to the Rayleigh line. To get from state 1to state 2, we would heat the ﬂow and then cool it, with no net heat transfer. The conclusion we come to is that states 1and 2represent a change in a ﬂow for which there is no heat transfer, no friction, and no area change; moreover, it is “violent” because the ﬂow changes from state 1to state 2without following a process curve; so entropy must increase. Note that Fig. 13.11 shows some trends we have mentioned: The ﬂow must go from super- to subsonic, and entropy and temperature must increase through a shock. Normal-Shock Flow Functions for One- Dimensional Flow of an Ideal Gas We have mentioned that the basic equations, Eqs. 13.11, can be used to analyze ﬂows that experience a normal shock. As in isentropic ﬂow, it is often more convenient touse Mach number-based equations, in this case based on the incoming Mach number,M This involves three steps: First, we obtain property ratios (e.g., T2/T1andp2/p1)i n terms of M1andM2, then we develop a relation between M1andM2, and ﬁnally, we use this relation to obtain expressions for property ratios in terms of upstream Machnumber, M The temperature ratio can be expressed as T2 T15T2 T02T02 T01T01 T1 Since stagnation temperature is constant across the shock, we have T2 T1511k21 2M2 1 11k21 2M2 2ð13:12Þ A velocity ratio may be obtained by using V2 V15M2c2 M1c15M2 M1ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃkRT 2p ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃkRT 1p 5M2 M1ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ T2 T1s13.3 Normal Shocks 719or V2 V15M2 M111k21 2M2 1 11k21 2M2 22 643 751=2 A ratio of densities may be obtained from the continuity equation ρ1V15ρ2V2 ð13:11aÞ so that ρ2 ρ15V1 V25M1 M211k21 2M2 2 11k21 2M2 12 643 751=2 ð13:13Þ Finally, we have the momentum equation, p11ρ1V2 15p21ρ2V2 2 ð13:11bÞ Substituting ρ5p/RT, and factoring out pressures, gives p111V2 1 RT1/C20/C21 5p211V2 2 RT2/C20/C21 Since V2 RT5kV2 kRT5kM2 then p111kM2 1/C2/C3 5p211kM2 2/C2/C3 Finally, p2 p1511kM2 1 11kM2 2ð13:14Þ To solve for M2in terms of M1, we must obtain another expression for one of the property ratios given by Eqs. 13.12 through 13.14.

The second expresses the unique dependence of M2onM1. Now, having a relationship between M2andM1, we can solve for property ratios across a shock. Knowing M1, we obtain M2from Eq. 13.16b; the property ratios can be determined subsequently from Eqs. 13.12 through 13.14. Since the stagnation temperature remains constant, the stagnation temperature ratio across the shock is unity.

Note that all changes through a normal shock depend only on M1, the incoming Mach number (as well as the ﬂuid property, k, the ratio of speciﬁc heats). The equations are usually preferable to the original equations, Eq. 13.11, because they provide explicit, uncoupled expressions for property changes; Eqs. 13.11 are occasionally useful too. Note that Eq. 13.20d requires M1.1 for p2.p1, which agrees with our previous discussion. The ratio p2/p1is known as the strength of the shock; the higher the incoming Mach number, the stronger (more violent) the shock. Equations 13.20, while quite complex algebraically, provide explicit property relations in terms of the incoming Mach number, M1. They are so useful that some calculators have some of them built in (e.g., the HP 48G series [1]); it is a good idea to program them if your calculator does not already have them. There are also inter- active Web sites that make them available (see, e.g., [2]), and they are fairly easy to deﬁne in spreadsheets such as Excel. The reader is urged to download the Excel add- ins for these equations from the Web site; with the add-ins, functions are available for computing M2, and the stagnation pressure, temperature, pressure, and density/ velocity ratios, from M1,a n d M1from these ratios. Appendix E.2 lists ﬂow functions forM2and property ratios p02=p01,T2/T1,p2/p1, and ρ2/ρ1(V1/V2) in terms of M1for normal-shock ﬂow of an ideal gas. A table of values, as well as a plot of these propertyratios, is presented for air ( k51.4) for a limited range of Mach numbers. The associated Excel workbook, Normal-Shock Relations , can be used to print a larger table of values for air and other ideal gases. A problem involving a normal shock is solved in Example 13.6.

The possibility of a normal shock must be considered in any supersonic ﬂow. Sometimes a shock must occur to match a downstream pressure condition; it is desirable to determine if a shockwill occur and the shock location when it does occur. In Section 13.3 we showed that stagnation pressure decreases dramatically across a shock: The stronger the shock, the larger the decrease in stagnation pressure. It isnecessary to control shock position to obtain acceptable performance from a super-sonic diffuser or supersonic wind tunnel. In this section isentropic ﬂow in a converging-diverging nozzle (Section 13.2) is extended to include shocks. Additional topics (on the Web site) include operation of supersonic diffusers and supersonic wind tunnels, ﬂows with friction, and ﬂows with heat addition.

The pressure distribution through a nozzle for different back pressures is shown in Fig. 13.12 . Four ﬂow regimes are possible. In Regime I the ﬂow is subsonic throughout. The ﬂow rate increases with decreasing back pressure. At condition ( iii), which forms the dividing line between Regimes I and II, ﬂow at the throat is sonic, and Mt51. As the back pressure is lowered below condition ( iii), a normal shock appears downstream from the throat, as shown by condition ( vi). There is a pressure rise across the shock. Since the ﬂow is subsonic ( M,1) after the shock, the ﬂow decelerates, with an accompanying increase in pressure, through the diverging chan-nel. As the back pressure is lowered further, the shock moves downstream until it appears at the exit plane (condition vii). In Regime II, as in Regime I, the exit ﬂow is subsonic, and consequently p e5pb. Since ﬂow properties at the throat are constant for all conditions in Regime II, the ﬂow rate in Regime II does not vary with backpressure. In Regime III, as exempliﬁed by condition ( viii), the back pressure is higher than the exit pressure, but not high enough to sustain a normal shock in the exit plane. Theﬂow adjusts to the back pressure through a series of oblique compression shocks outside the nozzle; these oblique shocks cannot be treated by one-dimensional theory. As previously noted in Section 13.2, condition ( iv) represents the design condition. In Regime IV the ﬂow adjusts to the lower back pressure through a series of oblique expansion waves outside the nozzle; these oblique expansion waves cannot be treatedby one-dimensional theory. TheTsdiagram for converging-diverging nozzle ﬂow with a normal shock is shown in Fig. 13.13 ; state 1is located immediately upstream from the shock and state 2is immediately downstream. The entropy increase across the shock moves the subsonic downstream ﬂow to a new isentropic line. The critical temperature is constant, so p*2is lower than p*1. Since ρ*5p*=RT*, the critical density downstream also is reduced. To carry the same mass ﬂow rate, the downstream ﬂow must have a largercritical area. From continuity (and the equation of state), the critical area ratio is theinverse of the critical pressure ratio, i.e., across a shock, p*A*5constant. If the Mach number (or position) of the normal shock in the nozzle is known, the exit-plane pressure can be calculated directly. In the more realistic situation,the exit-plane pressure is speciﬁed, and the position and strength of the shock are unknown. The subsonic ﬂow downstream must leave the nozzle at the back pressure, sop b5pe.

In this section we consider ﬂows in which wall friction is responsible for changes in ﬂuid properties. As for isentropic ﬂow with area variation (Section 13.2) and the normal shock (Section 13.3), our starting point in analyzing ﬂows with friction is the set of basicequations (Eqs. 13.1), describing one-dimensional motion that is affected by severalphenomena: area change, friction, heat transfer, and normal shocks. These are ρ 1V1A15ρ2V2A25ρVA5/C1m5constant ð13:1aÞ Rx1p1A12p2A25/C1mV 22/C1mV 1 ð13:1bÞ δQ dm1h11V2 1 25h21V2 2 2ð13:1cÞ /C1mðs22s1Þ$Z CS1 T_Q A ! dA ð13:1dÞ p5ρRT ð13:1eÞ Δh5h22h15cpΔT5cpðT22T1Þ ð13:1fÞ Δs5s22s15cplnT2 T12Rlnp2 p1ð13:1gÞ Equation 13.1a is continuity , Eq. 13.1b is a momentum equation , Eq. 13.1c is an energy equation, Eq. 13.1d is the second law of thermodynamics , and Eqs. 13.1e, 13.1f, and 13.1g are useful property relations for an ideal gas with constant speciﬁc heats. We must simplify these equations for ﬂow in a constant-area duct with friction. We must think about what happens to the heat that friction generates. There are twoobvious cases we can consider: In the ﬁrst we assume that the ﬂow is adiabatic , so any heat generated remains in the ﬂuid; in the second we assume that the ﬂow remainsisothermal , so the ﬂuid either gives off heat or absorbs heat as necessary. While some ﬂows may be neither adiabatic nor isothermal, many real-world ﬂows are. Flow in arelatively short duct will be approximately adiabatic; ﬂow in a very long duct (e.g., an uninsulated natural gas pipeline) will be approximately isothermal (the pipeline will be at the ambient temperature). We consider ﬁrst adiabatic ﬂow. Basic Equations for Adiabatic Flow We can simplify Eqs. 13.1 for frictional adiabatic ﬂow in a constant-area duct of anideal gas with constant speciﬁc heats, as shown in Fig. 13.18 . We now have A 15A25A. In addition, for no heat transfer we have δQ/dm50. Finally, the force Rxis now due only to friction (no xcomponent of surface force is caused by pressure on the parallel sides of the channel). Hence, for this ﬂow ourequations simplify to ρ 1V15ρ2V25ρV/C17G5/C1m A5constant ð13:24aÞ Rx1p1A2p2A5/C1mV 22/C1mV 1 ð13:24bÞ13.5 Flow in a Constant-Area Duct with Friction 727h015h11V2 1 25h21V2 2 25h025h0 ð13:24cÞ s2.s1 ð13:24dÞ p5ρRT ð13:24eÞ Δh5h22h15cpΔT5cpðT22T1Þ ð13:24fÞ Δs5s22s15cplnT2 T12Rlnp2 p1ð13:24gÞ Equations 13.24 can be used to analyze frictional adiabatic ﬂow in a channel of constant area. For example, if we know conditions at section 1(i.e., p1,ρ1,T1,s1,h1, andV1), we can use these equations to ﬁnd conditions at some new section 2after the ﬂuid has experienced a total friction force Rx. It is the effect of friction that causes ﬂuid properties to change along the duct. For a known friction force we have sixequations (not including the constraint of Eq. 13.24d) and six unknowns ( p 2,ρ2,T2,s2, h2, and V2). In practice this procedure is unwieldy—as for isentropic ﬂow we have a set of nonlinear coupled algebraic equations to solve, and as for isentropic ﬂow we will eventually develop alternative approaches. For now, let’s see what Eqs. 13.24 indicatewill happen to the ﬂow. Adiabatic Flow: The Fanno Line If we were to attempt the calculations described above, as the ﬂow progresses downthe duct (i.e., for increasing values of R x), we would develop a relationship between Tandsshown qualitatively in Fig. 13.19 for two possibilities: a ﬂow that was initially subsonic (starting at some point 1), and ﬂow that was initially supersonic (starting at some point 1'). The locus of all possible downstream states is referred to as the Fanno line. Detailed calculations show some interesting features of Fanno-line ﬂow. At the point of maximum entropy, the Mach number is unity. On the upper branch ofthe curve, the Mach number is always less than unity, and it increases monotonicallyas we proceed to the right along the curve. At every point on the lower portion of thecurve, the Mach number is greater than unity; the Mach number decreases mono-tonically as we move to the right along the curve. For any initial state on a Fanno line, each point on the Fanno line represents a mathematically possible downstream state. In Fig. 13.19 we generated the curves by repeatedly solving Eqs. 13.24 for increasing values of the friction force, R x; the total friction force increases as we progress down the duct because we are including moreand more surface area. Note the arrows in Fig. 13.19, indicating that, as required byEq. 13.24d, the entropy must increase for this ﬂow. In fact it is because we dohave friction (an irreversibility) present in an adiabatic ﬂow that this must happen.1 2Rx V2p2 2T2 ρ V1p1 1T1 ρFlowCV y x Fig. 13.18 Control volume used for integral analysis of frictional adiabatic ﬂow.728 Chapter 13Compressible FlowReferring again to Fig. 13.19, we see that for an initially subsonic ﬂow (state 1), the effect of friction is to increase the Mach number toward unity. For a ﬂow that is initially supersonic (state 1'), the effect of friction is to decrease the Mach number toward unity. In developing the simpliﬁed form of the ﬁrst law for Fanno-line ﬂow, Eq. 13.24c, we found that stagnation enthalpy remains constant. Consequently, when the ﬂuid is anideal gas with constant speciﬁc heats, stagnation temperature must also remain con-stant. What happens to stagnation pressure? Friction causes the local isentropicstagnation pressure to decrease for all Fanno-line ﬂows, as shown in Fig. 13.20 . Since entropy must increase in the direction of ﬂow, the ﬂow process must proceed to theright on the Tsdiagram. In Fig. 13.20, a path from state 1to state 2is shown on the subsonic portion of the curve. The corresponding local isentropic stagnationpressures, p 01andp02, clearly show that p02,p01. An identical result is obtained for ﬂow on the supersonic branch of the curve from state 1'to state 2'. Again p02u,p01u. Thus p0decreases for any Fanno-line ﬂow. The effects of friction on ﬂow properties in Fanno-line ﬂow are summarized in Table 13.2 . 1'2'1 2M < 1 M > 1M = 1T sp01 = p01' p02 = p02' T0 = constant Fig. 13.20 Schematic of Fanno-line ﬂow on Tsplane, showing reduction in local isentropic stagnation pressure caused by friction.

You should follow through the logic indicated in the right column of the table. Note that the effect of friction is to accelerate a subsonic ﬂow! This seems a real puzzle—a violation of Newton’s second law—until we realize that the pressure isdropping quite rapidly, so the pressure gradient more than cancels the drag due tofriction. We can also note that the density is decreasing in this ﬂow (largely because ofthe pressure drop) mandating (from continuity) that the velocity must be increasing.All properties simultaneously affect one another (as expressed in the coupled set ofequations, Eqs. 13.24), so it is not possible to conclude that the change in any oneproperty is solely responsible for changes in any of the others. Note the parallel between normal shocks (Table 13.1 ) and supersonic ﬂow with friction (Table 13.2). Both represent irreversible processes in supersonic ﬂow, and all properties change in the same directions. We have noted that entropy must increase in the direction of ﬂow: It is the effect of friction that causes the change in ﬂow properties along the Fanno-line curve. FromFig. 13.20 , we see that there is a maximum entropy point corresponding to M51 for each Fanno line. The maximum entropy point is reached by increasing the amount offriction (through addition of duct length), just enough to produce a Mach number of unity (choked ﬂow) at the exit. If we insist on adding duct beyond this critical duct length, at which the ﬂow is choked, one of two things happens: If the inlet ﬂow issubsonic, the additional length forces the sonic condition to move down to the newexit, and the ﬂow rate in the duct (and Mach number at each location) decreases; if theinlet ﬂow is supersonic, the additional length causes a normal shock to appearsomewhere in the duct, and the shock moves upstream as more duct is added (formore details see Section 13.4). To compute the critical duct length, we must analyze the ﬂow in detail, accounting for friction. This analysis requires that we begin with a differential control volume,develop expressions in terms of Mach number, and integrate along the duct to thesection where M51. This is our next task, and it will involve quite a bit of algebraic manipulation, so ﬁrst we will demonstrate use of some of Eqs. 13.24 in Example 13.7. Example 13.7 FRICTIONAL ADIABATIC FLOW IN A CONSTANT-AREA CHANNEL Air ﬂow is induced in an insulated tube of 7.16 mm diameter by a vacuum pump. The air is drawn from a room,where p 05101 kPa (abs) and T0523/C14C, through a smoothly contoured converging nozzle. At section 1, where the nozzle joins the constant-area tube, the static pressure is 98.5 kPa (abs). At section 2, located some distance downstream in the constant-area tube, the air temperature is 14/C14C. Determine the mass ﬂow rate, the local isentropic stagnation pressure at section 2, and the friction force on the duct wall between sections 1and 2. Given: Air ﬂow in insulated tube Find: (a)/C1m. (b) Stagnation pressure at section 2. (c) Force on duct wall.

Knowledge of the total friction force between any two points in a Fanno-line ﬂow enables us to predict downstream conditions from known upstream conditions. Thetotal friction force is the integral of the wall shear stress over the duct surface area. Since wall shear stress varies along the duct, we must develop a differential equation and then integrate to ﬁnd property variations. To set up the differential equation, weuse the differential control volume shown in Fig. 13.21 . Comparing Fig. 13.21 to Fig. 13.19 we see that we can use the basic equations, Eqs. 13.24, for ﬂow in a duct with friction, if we replace T 1,p1,ρ1,V1, with T,p,ρ,V, and T2,p2,ρ2,V2, with T1dT;p1dp;ρ1dρ;V1dV, and also Rxwith2dFf.The local isentropic stagnation pressure is p025p2/C18 11k21 2M2 2/C19k=ðk21Þ 54:703104Pa½110:2ð0:396Þ2/C1383:5 p02552:4 kPa ðabsÞ ßp02 The friction force may be obtained using the momentum equation (Eq.13.24b), Rx1p1A2p2A5/C1mV 22/C1mV 2 ð13:24bÞ which we apply to the control volume shown above (except we replace Rxfrom Fig. 13.18 with2Ffbecause we know the friction force Ffon the ﬂuid acts in the negative xdirection). 2Ff5ðp22p1ÞA1/C1mðV22V1Þ 2Ff5ð4:7029:85Þ3104N m234:0331025m213:0831023kg s3ð134265:3Þm s3N/C1s2 kg/C1m or Ff51:86 N ðto the left ;as shown Þ This is the force exerted on the control volume by the duct wall.

Ducts of other than circular shape can be included in our analysis by introducing the hydraulic diameter D h54A Pð8:50Þ (Recall the factor of 4 was included in Eq. 8.50 so that Dhwould reduce to diameter D for circular ducts.)

Now we must integrate the equation to ﬁnd Mas a function of x. Integrating Eq. 13.32 between states 1and 2would produce a complicated function of both M1andM2. The function would have to be evaluated numerically for each new combination of M1andM2encountered in a problem. Calculations can be simpliﬁed considerably using critical conditions (where, by deﬁnition, M51). All Fanno-line ﬂows tend toward M51, so integration is between a section where the13.5 Flow in a Constant-Area Duct with Friction 735Mach number is Mand the section where sonic conditions occur (the critical condi- tions).

They are also fairly easy to deﬁne in spreadsheets such as Excel . The reader is urged to download the Excel add-ins for these equations from the Web site; with the add-ins, functions are available for computing the friction factor, temperature, velocity, pressure, and stagnation pressure ratios from M,a n dM from these ratios. It is important to remember that, as demonstrated in Fig. 12.4, the properties at a state, in any ﬂow process, may be related to that state’s isentropic stagnation properties throughuse of Eqs. 12.21.

A table of values, as well as a plot of these property ratios, is presented for air ( k5 1.4) for a limited range of Mach numbers. The associated Excel workbook, Fanno-Line Relations , can be used to print a larger table of values for air and other ideal gases.

For example, for a gradual cooling it will decrease! Equations 13.43 can be used to analyze frictionless ﬂow in a channel of constant area with heat exchange. For example, if we know conditions at section 1(i.e., p1,ρ1, T1,s1,h1,a n dV 1) we can use these equations to ﬁnd conditions at some new section 2 after the ﬂuid has experienced a total heat exchange δQ/dm. For a given heat exchange, we have six equations (not including the constraint of Eq. 13.43d) and sixunknowns ( p 2,ρ2,T2,s2,h2, and V2). It is the effect of heat exchange that causes ﬂuid properties to change along the duct. In practice, as we have seen for other ﬂows, this procedure is unwieldy—we again have a set of nonlinear coupled algebraic equations to solve. We will use Eqs. 13.43 in Example 13.9. We will also develop some Mach number-based relations to supplement or replace the basic equations, and show howto use these in Example 13.10. The Rayleigh Line If we use Eqs. 13.43 to compute property values as a given ﬂow proceeds with aprescribed heat exchange rate, we obtain a curve shown qualitatively in the Tsplane in Fig. 13.24 . The locus of all possible downstream states is called the Rayleigh line . The calculations show some interesting features of Rayleigh-line ﬂow. At the point ofmaximum temperature (point aof Fig. 13.24), the Mach number for an ideal gas is 1=ﬃﬃﬃ kp . At the point of maximum entropy (point bof Fig. 13.24), M51. On the upper branch of the curve, Mach number is always less than unity, and it increases mono- tonically as we proceed to the right along the curve. At every point on the lowerportion of the curve, Mach number is greater than unity, and it decreases mono-tonically as we move to the right along the curve. Regardless of the initial Machnumber, with heat addition the ﬂow state proceeds to the right, and with heatrejection the ﬂow state proceeds to the left along the Rayleigh line. For any initial state in a Rayleigh-line ﬂow, any other point on the Rayleigh line represents a mathematically possible downstream state. Although the Rayleighline represents all mathematically possible states, are they all physically attainabledownstream states? A moment’s reﬂection will indicate that they are. Since we areconsidering a ﬂow with heat exchange, the second law (Eq. 13.43d) does not imposeany restrictions on the sign of the entropy change.13.6 Frictionless Flow in a Constant-Area Duct with Heat Exchange 741The effects of heat exchange on properties in steady, frictionless, compressible ﬂow of an ideal gas are summarized in Table 13.3 ; the basis of each indicated trend is discussed in the next few paragraphs. The direction of entropy change is always determined by the heat exchange; entropy increases with heating and decreases with cooling. Similarly, the ﬁrst law, Eq. 13.43c, shows that heating increases the stagnation enthalpy and cooling decreasesit; since Δh 05cpΔT0, the effect on stagnation temperature is the same. The effect of heating and cooling on temperature may be deduced from the shape of the Rayleigh line in Fig. 13.24 . We see that except for the region 1 =ﬃﬃﬃ kp ,M,1 (for air, 1 =ﬃﬃﬃ kp /C250:85), heating causes Tto increase, and cooling causes Tto decrease. However, we also see the unexpected result that for 1 =ﬃﬃﬃ kp ,M,1,heat addition causes the stream temperature to decrease , and heat rejection causes the stream temperature to increase! For subsonic ﬂow, the Mach number increases monotonically with heating, until M51 is reached. For given inlet conditions, all possible downstream states lie on a single Rayleigh line. Therefore, the point M51 determines the maximum possible heat addition without choking. If the ﬂow is initially supersonic, heating will reduce the Mach number. Again, the maximum possible heat addition without choking is that which reduces the Mach number to M51.0. The effect of heat exchange on static pressure is obtained from the shapes of the Rayleigh line and of constant-pressure lines on the Tsplane (see Fig. 13.25 ). For M,1, pressure falls with heating, and for M.1, pressure increases, as shown by the shapes of the constant-pressure lines. Once the pressure variation has been found, the effect onvelocity may be found from the momentum equation, p 1A2p2A5/C1mV 22/C1mV 1 ð13:43bÞ or p1/C1m A/C18/C19 V5constant Thus, since/C1m=Ais a positive constant, trends in pandVmust be opposite.

This is illus- trated schematically in Fig. 13.25 . A reduction in stagnation pressure has obvious practical implications for heating processes, such as combustion chambers. Adding the same amount of energy per unit mass (same change in T0) causes a larger change in p0 for supersonic ﬂow; because heating occurs at a lower temperature in supersonic ﬂow,the entropy increase is larger.Table 13.3 Summary of Effects of Heat Exchange on Fluid Properties PropertyHeating Cooling Obtained from: M,1 M.1M,1 M.1 Entropy s s s s Td s equation Stagnation temperature T0 T0 T0 T0 First law, and Δh05cpΔT0 Temperature T M,1ﬃﬃ kp/C16/C17 T T M,1ﬃﬃ kp/C16/C17 T Shape of Rayleigh line T1ﬃﬃ kp,M,1/C16/C17 T1ﬃﬃ kp,M,1/C16/C17 Mach number M M M M Trend on Rayleigh line Pressure p p p p Trend on Rayleigh line Velocity V V V V Momentum equation, and effect on p Density ρ ρ ρ ρ Continuity equation, and effect on V Stagnation pressure p0 p0 p0 p0 Fig. 13.25 12p01 p2 p1T01p02 T02 s2 – s1M = 1 Rayleigh line sT (a) Subsonic flow34p03 p4 p3T03p04 T04 s4 – s3M = 1 Rayleigh line sT (b) Supersonic flow Fig. 13.25 Reduction in stagnation pressure due to heat addition for two ﬂow cases.13.6 Frictionless Flow in a Constant-Area Duct with Heat Exchange 743Example 13.9 FRICTIONLESS FLOW IN A CONSTANT-AREA DUCT WITH HEAT ADDITION Air ﬂows with negligible friction through a duct of area A50.25 ft2.

To reduce labor in solving problems, it is convenient to derive ﬂow functions for property ratios in terms of local Mach number as we didfor Fanno-line ﬂow. The reference state is again taken as the critical condition whereM51; properties at the critical condition are denoted by (*). Dimensionless properties (such as p/p* and T/T*) may be obtained by writing the basic equations between a point in the ﬂow where properties are M,T,p, etc., and the critical state ( M51, with properties denoted as T*,p*, etc.). The pressure ratio, p/p*, may be obtained from the momentum equation, Eq. 13.43b, pA2p*A5/C1mV*2/C1mV or p1ρV 25p*1ρ*V*2 Substituting ρ5p/RT, and factoring out pressures yields p11V2 RT/C20/C21 5p*11V*2 RT*/C20/C21 Noting that V2/RT5k(V2/kRT)5kM2, we ﬁnd p11kM2/C2/C3 5p*11k ½/C138 and ﬁnally, p p*511k 11kM2ð13:44aÞ From the ideal gas equation of state, T T*5p p*ρ* ρ From the continuity equation, Eq. 13.43a, ρ* ρ5V V*5Mc c*5Mﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ T T*rTo complete our analysis, let us examine the change in p0by comparing p02 with p01. p015p1/C18T01 T1/C19k=ðk21Þ 520:0 psia/C18611 600/C193:5 521:3 psia ßp01 Comparing, we see that p02is less than p01.This prob lemillustrates theuseofthebasicequa tions, Eqs.13.43,forana-lyzin gfrictionless ﬂow ofanidealgasinaductwithheatexchange.

They are obviously complicated, but canbe programmed into your calculator. They are also fairly easy to deﬁne in spread-sheets such as Excel. The reader is urged to download the Excel add-ins for these equations from the Web site; with the add-ins, functions are available for computingthe pressure, temperature, density, and stagnation temperature and pressure ratiosfrom M, and Mfrom these ratios. In Example 13.10 we will explore their use. Appendix E.4 lists ﬂow functions for property ratios T 0=T*0,p0=p*0,T/T*,p/p*, and ρ*/ ρ(V/V*), in terms of Mfor Rayleigh-line ﬂow of an ideal gas. A table of values, as well as a plot of these property ratios, is presented for air ( k51.4) for a limited range of Mach numbers. The associated Excel workbook, Rayleigh-Line Relations , can be used to print a larger table of values for air and other ideal gases.

With the under- standing we have developed, we are ready to introduce some basic concepts of two-dimensional ﬂow: oblique shocks andexpansion waves . Oblique Shocks In Section 12.2, we discussed the Mach cone, with Mach angle α, that is generated by an airplane ﬂying at M.1, as shown (in airplane coordinates) in Fig. 13.26 a. The Mach cone is a weak pressure (sound) wave, so weak that, as shown in Fig. 13.26 a,i t barely disturbs the streamlines—it is the limiting case of an oblique shock. If we zoomin on the airplane, we see that at the nose of the airplane we have an oblique shock—ashock wave that is aligned, at some angle β,90 /C14, to the ﬂow. This oblique shock causes the streamlines to abruptly change direction (usually to follow the surface ofthe airplane or the airplane’s airfoil). Further away from the airplane we still have an oblique shock, but it becomes progressively weaker ( βdecreases) and the streamlines experience smaller deﬂections until, far away from the airplane the oblique shock becomes a Mach cone ( β-α) and the streamlines are essentially unaffected by the airplane. A supersonic airplane does not necessarily generate an oblique shock that is attached to its nose—we may instead have a detached normal shock ahead of theairplane! In fact, as illustrated in Fig. 13.27 , as an airplane accelerates to its supersonic cruising speed the ﬂow will progress from subsonic, through supersonic with a detached normal shock, to attached oblique shocks that become increasingly “pressed” against the airplane’s surface.The process follows the supersonic branch of a Rayleigh line: T02p02 T01p01 T2p2 T1p12 1T sRayleigh lineThis problemillustratestheuseoftheRayleigh-lineequations,Eqs.13.44,foranalyzingfrictionless ﬂow ofanidealgasinaductwithheatexchange.

VIDEO Shock Waves over a Supersonic Airplane. 750 Chapter 13Compressible FlowWe can explain these ﬂow phenomena using concepts we developed in our analysis of normal shocks. Consider the oblique shock shown in Fig. 13.28 a. It is at some angle βwith respect to the incoming supersonic ﬂow, with velocity ~V1, and causes the ﬂow to deﬂect at some angle θ, with velocity ~V2after the shock. It is convenient to orient the xycoordinates orthogonal to the oblique shock, and decompose ~V1and ~V2into components normal and tangential to the shock, as shown in Fig. 13.28 b, with appropriate subscripts. The control volume is assumed to have arbitrary area Abefore and after the shock, and inﬁnitesimal thickness across the shock (the upper and lower surfaces in Fig. 13.28 b). For this inﬁnitesimal control volume, we can write the basic equations: continuity, momentum, and the ﬁrst and second laws of thermodynamics. The continuity equation is ∂ ∂t/H20885 CV dV /H11001 /H20885 CS V /H11080 dA /H11005 0/H11005 0(1) ρρ ð4:12Þ Assumption: (1) Steady ﬂow.(a) Oblique shock (b) Oblique shock in shock coordinatesV1V2 V1tV2t y xV1nV2nβ βθCV( – )βθ Fig. 13.28 Oblique shock control volume.Streamline Oblique shockWeaker oblique shockMach cone Streamlineα (a) Mach cone (b) Oblique shockβ Fig. 13.26 Mach cone and oblique shock generated by airplane.

For a given Mach number, we can compute θas a function ofβ, as shown in Fig. 13.29 for air ( k51.4). Appendix E.5 presents a table of values of deﬂection angle θas a function of Mach number M1and oblique shock angle βfor air ( k51.4) for a limited range of Mach numbers. The associated Excel workbook, Oblique-Shock Relations , can be used to print a larger table of values for air and other ideal gases. The reader is urged to download the oblique shock Excel add-in from the Web site; it can be used for solving Eq. 13.49 for the deﬂection angle θ, oblique shock β,o rM1. We should note that we used M1and shock angle βto compute θ, but in reality the causality is the reverse: it is the deﬂection θcaused by an object such as the surface of an airplane wing that causes an oblique shock at angle β. We can draw some inter- esting conclusions from Fig. 13.29 : /C15For a given Mach number and deﬂection angle, there are generally twopossible oblique shock angles—we could generate a weak shock (smaller βvalue, and hence, smaller normal Mach number, M1n) or a strong shock (larger βvalue, and hence, larger normal Mach number). In most cases the weak shock appears (exceptionsinclude situations where the downstream pressure is forced to take on a large valueas caused by, for example, an obstruction). /C15For a given Mach number, there is a maximum deﬂection angle. For example, forair (k51.4), if M 153, the maximum deﬂection angle is θmax/C2534/C14. Any attempt to deﬂect the ﬂow at an angle θ.θmaxwould cause a detached normal shock to form instead of an oblique shock. /C15For zero deﬂection ( θ-0), the weak shock becomes a Mach wave and β-α5 sin21ð1=M1Þ. Figure 13.29 can be used to explain the phenomena shown in Fig. 13.27.

For example, for θ510/C14, we obtain the following results: As M1increases from subsonic through about 1.4 there is no oblique shock solution—we instead either have no shock (subsonic ﬂow) or adetached normal shock; at some Mach number the normal shock ﬁrst attaches andbecomes an oblique shock (Problem 13.187 shows that for θ510 /C14, the normal shock ﬁrst attaches and becomes oblique at M1/C251.42, with β/C2567/C14); as M1increases from 1.6 through 1.8, 2.0, 2.5, etc., toward inﬁnity, from Fig. 13.29, β/C2551/C14,4 4/C14,3 9/C14,3 2/C14, toward 12/C14, respectively—the oblique shock angle progressively decreases, as we saw in Fig. 13.27. A problem involving oblique shocks is solved in Example 13.12. Example 13.12 OBLIQUE SHOCKS ON AN AIRFOIL An airplane travels at a speed of 600 m/s in air at 4/C14C and 100 kPa. The airplane’s airfoil has a sharp leading edge with included angle δ56/C14, and an angle of attack α51/C14. Find the pressures on the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil immediately after the leading edge. Given: Air ﬂow over sharp leading edge with: p15100 kPa δ56/C14 T154/C14C α51/C14 V15600 m/s Find: Pressure on upper and lower surfaces. Solution: For an angle of attack of 1/C14of an airfoil with leading edge angle 6/C14, the deﬂection angles are θu52/C14andθl54/C14as shown.

We can ask ourselves what happens if we gradually redirect a supersonic ﬂow, for example, along a curved surface. The answer is that we may generate isentropic compression or expansion waves , as illustrated schematically in Figs. 13.30 aand 13.30 b, respectively. From Fig. 13.30 awe see that a series of compression waves will eventually converge, and their cumulative effect will eventually generate an obliqueshock not far from the curved surface. While compression waves do occur, theyare not of great interest because the oblique shocks they lead to usually dominate theaerodynamics—at most the waves are a local phenomenon. On the other hand, asshown in Fig. 13.30 b, expansion waves in series are divergent and so do not coalesce. Figure 13.30 cshows expansion around a sharp-edged corner. We wish to analyze these isentropic waves to obtain a relation between the deﬂection angle and the Mach number. First we note that each wave is a Mach wave,so is at angle α5sin 21ð1=MÞ, where Mis the Mach number immediately before the wave. Compression waves are convergent because the wave angle αincreases as the Mach number decreases. On the other hand, expansion waves are divergentbecause as the ﬂow expands the Mach number increases, decreasing the Mach angle.From the oblique-shock pressure ratio, Eqs. 13.48d, at M1nðupper Þ51:045, p2ðupper Þ p152k k11M2 1nðupper Þ2k21 k115231:4 ð1:411Þð1:045Þ22ð1:421Þ ð1:411Þ51:11 Hence, p2ðupper Þ51:11p15ð1:11Þ100 kPa 5111 kPa ßp2ðupper Þ (b) Lower surface ForM151.80 and θl54/C14, we obtain βlfrom tanθl52 cot βlðM2 1sin2βl21Þ M2 1ðk1cos 2 βlÞ12ð13:49Þ and ﬁnd βl537:4/C14 Then we can ﬁnd M1nðlower Þ, M1nðlower Þ5M1sinβl51:803sin 37 :4/C1451:093 The normal Mach number for the lower oblique shock is also close to one.

(It happens to be a com- pression wave, but the analysis that follows applies to both expansion and compres- sion waves.) The speed changes from VtoV1dV, with deﬂection dθ. As with the oblique shock analysis for Fig. 13.28 a, it is convenient to orient the xycoordinates orthogonal to the wave, as shown in Fig. 13.31 b. For this inﬁnitesimal control volume, we can write the basic equations (continuity, momentum, and the ﬁrst and second lawsof thermodynamics). Comparing the isentropic wave control volume of Fig. 13.31 bto the control volume for an oblique shock shown in Fig. 13.28, we see that the controlvolumes have similar features. However, an isentropic wave differs from an obliqueshock wave in two important ways: /C15The wave angle is α5sin 21ð1=MÞ, instead of angle βfor the oblique shock. /C15The changes in velocity and in density, pressure, etc., and the deﬂection angle, are all inﬁnitesimals. The second factor is the reason that the ﬂow, which is adiabatic, is isentropic. With these two differences in mind we repeat the analysis that we performed for the oblique shock.

While investigating the above ﬂows we developed insight into some interesting compressible ﬂow phenomena, including: üUse of Tsplots in visualizing ﬂow behavior. üFlow through, and necessary shape of, subsonic and supersonic nozzles and diffusers. üThe phenomenon of choked ﬂow in converging nozzles and C-D nozzles, and the circumstances under which shock waves develop in C-D nozzles. ü*The phenomena of choked ﬂow in ﬂows with friction and ﬂows with heat exchange. üComputation of pressures and lift and drag coefﬁcients for a supersonic airfoil.

(Courtesy of NASA.) Superman is faster than a speeding bullet. So how fast is that? It turns out that the highest speed of a bullet is about 1500 m/s, or about Mach 4.5 at sea level. Canhumans keep up with Superman? If we’re in orbit wecan (What is the Mach number of the Space Shuttle inorbit?—it’s a trick question!), because there’s nodrag—once we get up to speed, we can stay there—but ﬂying at hypersonic speeds (i.e., above about M55) in the atmosphere requires tremendous engine thrust and an engine that can function at all at such speeds. In2004, an air-breathing X-43A managed to ﬂy at almostMach 10, or about 7000 mph. The hypersonic scramjetengine in this airplane is actually integrated into theairframe, and the entire lower surface of the vehicle isshaped to make the engine work. The bulge on the underside in the ﬁgure is the engine. Unlike the tur- bojet engines used in many jet aircraft, which have fansand compressors as major components, the scramjet,amazingly, has no moving parts, so if you were to look inside it there wouldn’t be much to see! Instead it uses geometry to develop a shock train that reduces thespeed of the airﬂow from hypersonic to supersonicvelocities. The scramjet, which is essentially a ramjetwith supersonic combustion, doesn’t need to slow theﬂow down to subsonic speeds. The compression ramon the undersurface of the aircraft slows the ﬂow downfrom hypersonic to supersonic speed before it reaches the engine. It does this by causing a sequence of oblique shocks (which we discussed in this chapter)that successively slow the ﬂow down and also increasethe air density. As the supersonic, relatively high-den-sity air passes through the engine, hydrogen fuel isinjected and combusts, creating tremendous thrust atthe exhaust. Once at hypersonic speed, the combustionprocess is self-sustaining. One of the problems the engineers faced was how to start the engine. First, the airplane has to beaccelerated above Mach 4 by conventional means (bya jet engine or rocket, or by piggy-backing anotheraircraft), and then the scramjet fuel can be started andignited. This sounds simple enough, but the ignitionprocess has been compared to “lighting a match in ahurricane”! The solution was to ignite using a mixture of pyrophoric silane (which auto-ignites when exposed to air) and hydrogen, then switch to pure hydrogen. The X-43A/Hyper-X is experimental, but in future we may expect to see scramjets in military applications(aircraft and missiles), then possibly in commercialaircraft. Conceivably, you could live in New York, go toa meeting in Los Angeles, and be back in New York fordinner!References 771Problems Isentropic Flow—Area Variation Most of the problems in this chapter involve computation of isentropic, Fanno, Rayleigh, normal shock, oblique shock, or isentropic expansion wave effects. The Web site for the text has associated Excel workbooks for each of these phenomena, and these are recommended for use while solving the problems (theWeb site also has Excel add-in functions, which the reader is urged to download and install). To avoid needless duplication,the computer symbol will only be used next to problems whenExcel has an additional beneﬁt (e.g., for graphing). 13.1 Air is extracted from a large tank in which the tem- perature and pressure are 70/C14C and 101 kPa (abs), respec- tively, through a nozzle. At one location in the nozzle thestatic pressure is 25 kPa and the diameter is 15 cm. What isthe mass ﬂow rate? Assume isentropic ﬂow. 13.2 Steam ﬂows steadily and isentropically through a nozzle. At an upstream section where the speed is negligible, thetemperature and pressure are 900 /C14F and 900 psia. At a section where the nozzle diameter is 0.188 in., the steam pressure is600 psia. Determine the speed and Mach number at this sec-tion and the mass ﬂow rate of steam. Sketch the passage shape. 13.3 Steam ﬂows steadily and isentropically through a nozzle.

Sketch the passageshape. 13.7 At a section in a passage, the pressure is 30 psia, the temperature is 100/C14F, and the speed is 1750 ft/s. At a section downstream the Mach number is 2.5.

A.1 a and A.1 band in Tables A.1 and A.2. For liquids speciﬁc gravity is a function of temperature. (Density data for water and air are given as functions of temperature in Tables A.7 through A.10.) For most liquids speciﬁc gravity decreases as temperatureincreases. Water is unique: It displays a maximum density of 1000 kg/m 3(1.94 slug/ft3) at 4/C14C (39/C14F). The maximum density of water is used as a reference value to calculate speciﬁc gravity. Thus SG/C17ρ ρH2Oðat 4/C14CÞ Consequently the maximum SG of water is exactly unity. Speciﬁc gravities for solids are relatively insensitive to temperature; values given in Table A.1 were measured at 20/C14C. The speciﬁc gravity of seawater depends on both its temperature and salinity.

At low pressures both values are about the same.Table A.3 Properties of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere Geometric Altitude (m) Temperature (K) p/pSL(—) ρ/ρSL(—) 2500 291.4 1.061 1.049 0 288.2 1.000a1.000b 500 284.9 0.9421 0.9529 1,000 281.7 0.8870 0.9075 1,500 278.4 0.8345 0.8638 2,000 275.2 0.7846 0.8217 2,500 271.9 0.7372 0.7812 3,000 268.7 0.6920 0.7423 3,500 265.4 0.6492 0.7048 4,000 262.2 0.6085 0.6689 4,500 258.9 0.5700 0.6343 5,000 255.7 0.5334 0.6012 6,000 249.2 0.4660 0.5389 7,000 242.7 0.4057 0.4817 8,000 236.2 0.3519 0.4292 9,000 229.7 0.3040 0.3813 10,000 223.3 0.2615 0.3376 11,000 216.8 0.2240 0.2978 12,000 216.7 0.1915 0.2546 13,000 216.7 0.1636 0.2176 14,000 216.7 0.1399 0.1860 15,000 216.7 0.1195 0.1590 16,000 216.7 0.1022 0.1359 17,000 216.7 0.08734 0.1162 18,000 216.7 0.07466 0.09930 19,000 216.7 0.06383 0.08489 20,000 216.7 0.05457 0.07258 22,000 218.6 0.03995 0.05266 24,000 220.6 0.02933 0.03832 26,000 222.5 0.02160 0.02797 28,000 224.5 0.01595 0.02047 30,000 226.5 0.01181 0.01503 40,000 250.4 0.002834 0.003262 50,000 270.7 0.0007874 0.0008383 60,000 255.8 0.0002217 0.0002497 70,000 219.7 0.00005448 0.00007146 80,000 180.7 0.00001023 0.00001632 90,000 180.7 0.000001622 0.000002588 Source: Data from Reference [7]. apSL51:013253105N=m2ðabsÞð514:696 psia Þ. bρSL51:2250 kg =m3ð50:002377 slug =ft3Þ.788 Appendix AFluid Property DataA.3 The Physical Nature of Viscosity Viscosity is a measure of internal ﬂuid friction, i.e., resistance to deformation. The mechanism of gas viscosity is reasonably well understood, but the theory is poorlydeveloped for liquids. We can gain some insight into the physical nature of viscousﬂow by discussing these mechanisms brieﬂy. The viscosity of a Newtonian ﬂuid is ﬁxed by the state of the material. Thus μ5μðT;pÞ. Temperature is the more important variable, so let us consider it ﬁrst. Excellent empirical equations for viscosity as a function of temperature are available. Effect of Temperature on Viscosity a. Gases All gas molecules are in continuous random motion. When there is bulk motiondue to ﬂow, the bulk motion is superimposed on the random motions. It is then distributedthroughout the ﬂuid by molecular collisions.

If two or more experimental points are available, the data may be correlated using the empirical Sutherland correlation [7] μ5bT1=2 11S=TðA:1Þ Constants bandSmay be determined most simply by writing μ5bT3=2 S1T or T3=2 μ51 b/C18/C19 T1S b (Compare this with y5mx1c.) From a plot of T3/2/μversus T, one obtains the slope, 1/ b, and the intercept, S/b. For air, b51:45831026kg m/C1s/C1K1=2 S5110 :4K These constants were used with Eq. A.1 to compute viscosities for the standard atmosphere in [7], the air viscosity values at various temperatures shown in Table A.10 , and using appropriate conversion factors, the values shown in Table A.9. b. Liquids Viscosities for liquids cannot be estimated well theoretically. The phenomenon ofmomentum transfer by molecular collisions is overshadowed in liquids by the effectsof interacting force ﬁelds among the closely packed liquid molecules. Liquid viscosities are affected drastically by temperature. This dependence on absolute temperature may be represented by the empirical equation μ5Ae B=ðT2CÞðA:2Þ or the equivalent form μ5A10B=ðT2CÞðA:3Þ where Tis absolute temperature. Equation A.3 requires at least three points to ﬁt constants A,B, and C. In theory it is possible to determine the constants from measurements of viscosity at just three temperatures. It is better practice to use more data and to obtain the constants from a statistical ﬁt to the data. However a curve-ﬁt is developed, always compare the resulting line or curve with the available data. The best way is to critically inspect a plot of the curve-ﬁt compared with the data. In general, curve-ﬁt results will be satisfactory only when the quality of the available data and that of the empirical relation are known to be excellent. Data for the dynamic viscosity of water are ﬁtted well using constant values A52:41431025N/C1s=m2,B5247.8 K, and C5140 K. Reference [10] states that using these constants in Eq. A.3 predicts water viscosity within 62.5 percent over the temperature range from 0/C14C to 370/C14C. Equation A.3 and Excel were used to compute790 Appendix AFluid Property Datathe water viscosity values at various temperatures shown in Table A.8 , and using appropriate conversion factors, the values shown in Table A.7. Note that the viscosity of a liquid decreases with temperature, while that of a gas increases with temperature.Glycerin1 N·s/m2 = 0.0209 lbf·s/ft2 Castor oil SAE 30 oil SAE 10W oil Mercury Kerosene Carbon tetrachloride Heptane HeliumMethane HydrogenCarbon dioxide AirWaterOctaneSAE 10W-30 oil1.0 1/H1100310–1 1/H1100310–2 1/H1100310–3 1/H1100310–4 1/H1100310–5 –20 0 20 40 60 Temperature, T (/H11034C)80 100 1208 6 4 2 8 6 4 2 8 6 4 2 8 6 4 2 8 6 8 64 224Absolute viscosity, μ (N·s/m2) Fig. A.2 Dynamic (absolute) viscosity of common ﬂuids as a function of temperature.

(Data from References [1, 6, and 10].) b. Liquids The viscosities of most liquids are not affected by moderate pressures, but large increases have been found at very high pressures. For example, the viscosity of waterat 10,000 atm is twice that at 1 atm. More complex compounds show a viscosityincrease of several orders of magnitude over the same pressure range. More information may be found in Reid and Sherwood [11].792 Appendix AFluid Property DataA.4 Lubricating Oils Engine and transmission lubricating oils are classiﬁed by viscosity according to stan- dards established by the Society of Automotive Engineers [12]. The allowable viscosity ranges for several grades are given in Table A.5 . Viscosity numbers with W (e.g., 20W) are classiﬁed by viscosity at 0/C14F. Those without W are classiﬁed by viscosity at 210/C14F. Multigrade oils (e.g., 10W-40) are formulated to minimize viscosity variation with temperature. High polymer “viscosity index improvers” are used in blending thesemultigrade oils. Such additives are highly non-Newtonian; they may suffer permanentviscosity loss caused by shearing. Special charts are available to estimate the viscosity of petroleum products as a function of temperature. The charts were used to develop the data for typical lubri-cating oils plotted in Figs. A.2 and A.3. For details, see [15]. A.5 Properties of Common Gases, Air and WaterTable A.5 Allowable Viscosity Ranges for Lubricants Engine OilSAE Viscosity GradeMax. Viscosity (cP)a at Temp.

Each manufacturer publishes complete performance data to allow application ofits machines in systems. This Appendix contains selected performance data for use insolving pump and fan system problems. Two pump types and one fan type areincluded. Choice of a manufacturer may be based on established practice, location, or cost. Once a manufacturer is chosen, machine selection is a three-step process: 1.Select a machine type, suited to the application, from a manufacturer’s full-line catalog, which gives the ranges of pressure rise (head) and ﬂow rate for eachmachine type. 2.Choose an appropriate machine model and driver speed from a master selectorchart, which superposes the head and ﬂow rate ranges of a series of machines onone graph. 3.Verify that the candidate machine is satisfactory for the intended application, using a detailed performance curve for the speciﬁc machine. It is wise to consult with experienced system engineers, either employed by the machine manufacturer or in your own organization, before making a ﬁnal purchase decision. Many manufacturers currently use computerized procedures to select a machine that is most suitable for each given application. Such procedures are simply automatedversions of the traditional selection method. Use of the master selector chart and thedetailed performance curves is illustrated below for pumps and fans, using data from 803one manufacturer of each type of machine. Literature of other manufacturers differs in detail but contains the necessary information for machine selection. D.2 Pump Selection Representative data are shown in Figs. D.1 through D.10 for Peerless1horizontal split case single-stage (series AE) pumps and in Figs. D.11 and D.12 for Peerless multi-stage (series TU and TUT) pumps. Figures D.1 and D.2 are master pump selector charts for series AE pumps at 3500 and 1750 nominal rpm. On these charts, the model number (e.g., 6AE14) indicates thedischarge line size (6 in. nominal pipe), the pump series (AE), and the maximumimpeller diameter (approximately 14 in.). Figures D.3 through D.10 are detailed performance charts for individual pump models in the AE series. Figures D.11 and D.12 are master pump selector charts for series TU and TUT pumps at 1750 nominal rpm. Data for two-stage pumps are presented in Fig. D.11,while Fig. D.12 contains data for pumps with three, four, and ﬁve stages. Each pump performance chart contains curves of total head versus volume ﬂow rate; curves for several impeller diameters—tested in the same casing—are presented on a single graph. Each performance chart also contains curves showing pump efﬁ- ciency and driver power; the net positive suction head ( NPSH ) requirement, as it varies with ﬂow rate, is shown by the curve at the bottom of each chart. The best efﬁciency point (BEP) for each impeller may be found using the efﬁciency curves. Use of the master pump selector chart and detailed performance curves is illus- trated in Example D.1 . Example D.1 PUMP SELECTION PROCEDURE Select a pump to deliver 1750 gpm of water at 120 ft total head. Choose the appropriate pump model and driver speed. Specify the pump efﬁciency, driver power, and NPSH requirement. Given: Select a pump to deliver 1750 gpm of water at 120 ft total head. Find: (a) Pump model and driver speed.(b) Pump efﬁciency.(c) Driver power.(d)NPSH requirement. Solution:Use the pump selection procedure described in Section D-1 . (The numbers below correspond to the numbered steps given in the procedure.) 1.Select a machine type suited to the application. (This step actually requires a manufacturer’s full-line catalog, which is not reproduced here. The Peerless product line catalog speciﬁes a maximum delivery and head of2500 gpm and 660 ft for series AE pumps. Therefore the required performance can be obtained; assume theselection is to be made from this series.) 1Peerless Pump Company, P.O. Box 7026, Indianapolis, IN 46207-7026.804 Appendix DSelected Performance Curves for Pumps and FansD.3 Fan Selection Fan selection is similar to pump selection. A representative master fan selection chart is shown in Fig. D.13 for a series of Howden Buffalo2axial-ﬂow fans. The chart shows the efﬁciency of the entire series of fans as a function of total pressure rise and ﬂow rate.The series of numbers for each fan indicates the fan diameter in inches, the hub diameterin inches, and the fan speed in revolutions per minute. For instance, a 54-26-870 fan has afan diameter of 54 in., a hub diameter of 26 in., and should be operated at 870 rpm. Normally, ﬁnal evaluation of suitability of the fan model for the application would be done using detailed performance charts for the speciﬁc model. Instead, we use the efﬁciencies from Fig D.13, which are indicated by the shading of the different zones on the map. To calculate the power requirement for the fan motor, we use the followingequation: 3ðhpÞ5 QðcfmÞ3Δpðin:H2OÞ 63503η A sample fan selection is presented in Example D.2. Example D.2 FAN SELECTION PROCEDURE Select an axial ﬂow fan to deliver 30,000 cfm of standard air at 1.25 in. H 2O total pressure. Choose the appropriate fan model and driver speed. Specify the fan efﬁciency and driver power. Given: Select an axial ﬂow fan to deliver 30,000 cfm of standard air at 1.25 in. H 2O total head. Find: (a) Fan size and driver speed. (b) Fan efﬁciency.(c) Driver power. Solution:Use the fan selection procedure described in Section D-1. (The numbers below correspond to the numbered stepsgiven in the procedure.)2.Consult the master pump selector chart. The desired operating point is not within any pump contour on the 3500rpm selector chart (Fig. D.1 ). From the 1750 rpm chart (Fig. D.2), select a model 6AE14 pump. From the per- formance curve for the 6AE14 pump (Fig. D.6), choose a 13-in. impeller. 3.Verify the performance of the machine using the detailed performancechart. On the performance chart for the 6AE14 pump, project up fromthe abscissa at Q51750 gpm. Project across from H5120 ft on the ordinate. The intersection is the pump performance at the desiredoperating point: η/C2585:8 percent 3/C2564 hp From the operating point, project down to the NPSH requirement curve. At the intersection, read NPSH /C2517 ft. 2Howden Buffalo Inc., 2029 W.

(This step actually requires a manufacturer’s full-line catalog, which is not reproduced here. Assume the fan selection is to be made from the axial fan data presented in Fig.D.13.) 2.Consult the master fan selector chart. The desired operating pointis within the contour for the 48-21-860 fan on the selector chart(Fig. D.13). To achieve the desired performance requires driving the fan at 860 rpm. 3.Verify the performance of the machine using a detailed performance chart. To determine the efﬁciency, we consult Fig D.13 again. Weestimate an efﬁciency of 85 percent. To determine the motor powerrequirement, we use the equation given above: 35 Q3Δp 63503η530;000 cfm 31:25 in :H2O 635030:8556:95 hpThis completesthefanselectionpro-cess.Again,one shouldconsultwithexperiencedsystemengineers toverifythat thesystemoperatingconditionhasbeenpredictedaccuratelyand thefanhas beenselected correctly.

Not all data are equally good; the validity of data should be documentedbefore test results are used for design. Uncertainty analysis is the procedure used toquantify data validity and accuracy. Analysis of uncertainty also is useful during experiment design. Careful study may indicate potential sources of unacceptable error and suggest improved measurement methods. F.2 Types of Error Errors always are present when experimental measurements are made. Aside from gross blunders by the experimenter, experimental error may be of two types. Fixed (or systematic) error causes repeated measurements to be in error by the same amount for each trial. Fixed error is the same for each reading and can be removed by propercalibration or correction. Random error (nonrepeatability) is different for everyreading and hence cannot be removed. The factors that introduce random error areuncertain by their nature. The objective of uncertainty analysis is to estimate theprobable random error in experimental results. We assume that equipment has been constructed correctly and calibrated properly to eliminate ﬁxed errors. We assume that instrumentation has adequate resolution and that ﬂuctuations in readings are not excessive. We assume also that care is used in making and recording observations so that only random errors remain. 829F.3 Estimation of Uncertainty Our goal is to estimate the uncertainty of experimental measurements and calculated results due to random errors. The procedure has three steps: 1.Estimate the uncertainty interval for each measured quantity. 2.State the conﬁdence limit on each measurement. 3.Analyze the propagation of uncertainty into results calculated from experimental data. Below we outline the procedure for each step and illustrate applications with examples. Step 1 Estimate the measurement uncertainty interval . Designate the measured vari- ables in an experiment as x1,x2,...,xn. One possible way to ﬁnd the uncer- tainty interval for each variable would be to repeat each measurement many times. The result would be a distribution of data for each variable. Random errors in measurement usually produce a normal (Gaussian ) frequency dis- tribution of measured values. The data scatter for a normal distribution ischaracterized by the standard deviation, σ. The uncertainty interval for each measured variable, x i, may be stated as 6nσi, where n51, 2, or 3. However, the most typical situation in engineering work is a “single- sample” experiment, where only one measurement is made for each point [1].A reasonable estimate of the measurement uncertainty due to random error in a single-sample experiment usually is plus or minus half the smallest scale division (the least count ) of the instrument. However, this approach also must be used with caution, as illustrated in the following example. When repeated measurements of a variable are available, they are usually normally distributed data, for which over 99 percent of measured values ofx ilie within 63σiof the mean value, 95 percent lie within 62σi, and 68 percent lie within 6σiof the mean value of the data set [2]. Thus it would be possible to quantify expected errors within any desired conﬁdence limit if a statistically signiﬁcant set of data were available.Example F.1 UNCERTAINTY IN BAROMETER READING The observed height of the mercury barometer column is h5752.6 mm. The least count on the vernier scale is 0.1 mm, so one might estimate the probablemeasurement error as 60.05 mm. A measurement probably could not be made this precisely. The barometer sliders and meniscus must be aligned by eye. The slider has a least count of1 mm. As a conservative estimate, a measurement could be made to the nearest millimeter. The probable value of a single measurement then would be expressed as 752.6 60.5 mm. The relative uncertainty in barometric height would be stated as u h560:5m m 752 :6m m560:000664 or 60:0664 percentComments: Anuncertaintyintervalof60.1per-centcorrespondstoaresultspeci-ﬁed tothreesigni ﬁcantﬁgures;thisprecisionissufﬁcientformostengi-neeringwork.2.Themeasurementofbarometerheightwas precise,asshownbytheuncertaintyestimate.Butwas itaccurate?Attypicalroomtempera-tures,theobservedbarometerreadingmustberedu cedby atem-peraturecorrectionofnearly3mm!This isanexampleofaﬁxederrorthat requiresacorrectionfacto r.830 Appendix FAnalysis of Experimental UncertaintyThe method of repeated measurements usually is impractical. In most applications it is impossible to obtain enough data for a statistically signiﬁcant sample owing to the excessive time and cost involved. However, the normal distribution suggests several important concepts: Small errors are more likely than large ones. Plus and minus errors are about equally likely.3. No ﬁnite maximum error can be speciﬁed. Step 2 State the conﬁdence limit on each measurement. The uncertainty interval of a measurement should be stated at speciﬁed odds. For example, one may writeh5752.660.5 mm (20 to 1). This means that one is willing to bet 20 to 1 that the height of the mercury column actually is within 60.5 mm of the stated value. It should be obvious [3] that “ ...the speciﬁcation of such odds can only be made by the experimenter based on ...total laboratory experience. There is no substitute for sound engineering judgment in estimating the uncertainty of a measured variable.” The conﬁdence interval statement is based on the concept of standard deviation for a normal distribution. Odds of about 370 to 1 correspond to 63σ; 99.7 percent of all future readings are expected to fall within the interval. Odds of about 20 to 1 correspond to 62σand odds of 3 to 1 correspond to 6σ conﬁdence limits. Odds of 20 to 1 typically are used for engineering work. Step 3 Analyze the propagation of uncertainty in calculations . Suppose that mea- surements of independent variables, x 1,x2,...,xn, are made in the laboratory. The relative uncertainty of each independently measured quantity is estimatedasu i. The measurements are used to calculate some result, R, for the experiment. We wish to analyze how errors in the xispropagate into the cal- culation of Rfrom measured values. In general, Rmay be expressed mathematically as R5R(x1,x2,...,xn). The effect on Rof an error in measuring an individual ximay be estimated by analogy to the derivative of a function [4]. A variation, δxi,i nxiwould cause variation δRiinR, δRi5@R @xiδxi The relative variation in Ris δRi R51 R@R @xiδxi5xi R@R @xiδxi xiðF:1Þ Equation F.1 may be used to estimate the relative uncertainty in the result dueto uncertainty in x i. Introducing the notation for relative uncertainty, we obtain uRi5xi R@R @xiuxiðF:2Þ How do we estimate the relative uncertainty in Rcaused by the combined effects of the relative uncertainties in all the xis? The random error in each variable has a range of values within the uncertainty interval. It is unlikely thatall errors will have adverse values at the same time.

The tube diameter is given as D56.35 mm. Do we assume that it is exact? The diameter might be measured to the nearest 0.1 mm. If so, the relative uncertainty in diameter would be estimated as uD560:05 mm 6:35 mm560:00787 or 60:787 percent The viscosity of water depends on temperature. The temperature is estimated as T52460.5/C14C. How will the uncertainty in temperature affect the uncertainty in μ?

F.5 Summary A statement of the probable uncertainty of data is an important part of reporting experimental results completely and clearly. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers requires that all manuscripts submitted for journal publication include an adequatestatement of uncertainty of experimental data [5]. Estimating uncertainty in experimental results requires care, experience, and judgment, in common with many endeavors in engineering. We have emphasized the need to quantify the uncertainty of mea- surements, but space allows including only a few examples. Much more information is available in the references that follow (e.g., [4,6, 7]). We urge you to consult them when designing experiments or analyzing data. References 1.Kline, S. J., and F. A.

Thus it often is necessary to convert from one system of units to another. In principle, all derived units can be expressed in terms of basic units. Then, only conversion factors for basic units would be required. In practice, many engineering quantities are expressed in terms of deﬁned units, for example, the horsepower, British thermal unit (Btu), quart, or nautical mile. Deﬁni-tions for such quantities are necessary, and additional conversion factors are useful incalculations. Basic SI units and necessary conversion factors, plus a few deﬁnitions and con- venient conversion factors are given in Table G.2 .
