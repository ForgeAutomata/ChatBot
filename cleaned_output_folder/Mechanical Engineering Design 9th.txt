He authored or co-authored eight books, including Theory of Machines and Mechanisms (with John J. Uicker, Jr.), and Applied Mechanics of Materials . He was Coeditor-in-Chief of the well-known Standard Handbook of Machine Design . He began Machine Design as sole author in 1956, and it evolved into Mechanical Engineering Design , setting the model for such textbooks. He contributed to the ﬁrst ﬁve editions of this text, along with co-authors Larry Mitchell and Charles Mischke. Uncounted numbers of students across the world got their ﬁrst taste of machine design with Shigley’s textbook, which has literally become a classic. Practically every mechanical engineer for the past half century has referenced termi- nology, equations, or procedures as being from “Shigley.” McGraw-Hill is honored to have worked with Professor Shigley for over 40 years, and as a tribute to his lasting contribution to this textbook, its title ofﬁcially reﬂects what many have already come to call it— Shigley’s Mechanical Engineering Design . Having received a Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University and a Master of Science in Engineering Mechanics from The University of Michigan, Professor Shigley pursued an academic career at Clemson College from 1936 through 1954. This lead to his position as Professor and Head of Mechanical Design and Drawing at Clemson College. He joined the faculty of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of The University of Michigan in 1956, where he remained for 22 years until his retirement in 1978. Professor Shigley was granted the rank of Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1968. He received the ASME Mechanisms Committee Award in 1974, the Worcester Reed Warner Medal for outstanding contribution to the perma- nent literature of engineering in 1977, and the ASME Machine Design Award in 1985. Joseph Edward Shigley indeed made a difference. His legacy shall continue.Dedication to Joseph Edward Shigleybud29281_fm_i-xxii_1.qxd 12/24/09 3:38 PM Page vi epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Richard G.

mechanical engineering design. The focus is on blending fundamental development of concepts with practi- cal specification of components. Students of this text should find that it inherently directs them into familiarity with both the basis for decisions and the standards of industrial components. For this reason, as students transition to practicing engineers, they will find that this text is indispensable as a reference text. The objectives of the text are to: •Cover the basics of machine design, including the design process, engineering mechanics and materials, failure prevention under static and variable loading, and characteristics of the principal types of mechanical elements •Offer a practical approach to the subject through a wide range of real-world applica- tions and examples •Encourage readers to link design and analysis •Encourage readers to link fundamental concepts with practical component speciﬁcation. New to This Edition Enhancements and modifications to the ninth edition are described in the following summaries: •New and revised end-of-chapter problems. This edition includes 1017 end-of- chapter problems, a 43 percent increase from the previous edition. Of these prob- lems, 671 are new or revised, providing a fresh slate of problems that do not have years of previous circulation. Particular attention has been given to adding problems that provide more practice with the fundamental concepts. With an eye toward both the instructor and the students, the problems assist in the process of acquiring knowledge and practice. Multiple problems with variations are available for the basic concepts, allowing for extra practice and for a rotation of similar problems between semesters. •Problems linked across multiple chapters. To assist in demonstrating the linkage of topics between chapters, a series of multichapter linked problems is introduced. Table 1–1 on p. 24 provides a guide to these problems. Instructors are encouraged to select several of these linked problem series each semester to use in homework assignments that continue to build upon the background knowledge gained in previous assignments. Some problems directly build upon the results of previous problems, which can either be provided by the instructor or by the students’ results from working the previous problems. Other problems simply build upon the back- ground context of previous problems. In all cases, the students are encouraged to see the connectivity of a whole process. By the time a student has worked throughPreface xvbud29281_fm_i-xxii_1.qxd 12/24/09 3:38 PM Page xv epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:a series of linked problems, a substantial analysis has been achieved, addressing such things as deflection, stress, static failure, dynamic failure, and multiple component selection. Since it comes one assignment at a time, it is no more daunting than regular homework assignments. Many of the linked problems blend very nicely with the transmission case study developed throughout the book, and detailed in Chap. 18. •Content changes. The bulk of the content changes in this edition falls into categories of pedagogy and keeping current. These changes include improved examples, clari- ﬁed presentations, improved notations, and updated references. A detailed list of content changes is available on the resource website, www.mhhe.com/shigley. A few content changes warrant particular mention for the beneﬁt of instructors familiar with previous editions. •Transverse shear stress is covered in greater depth (Sec. 3–11 and Ex. 3–7). •The sections on strain energy and Castigliano’s method are modiﬁed in presenta- tion of equations and examples, particularly in the deﬂections of curved members (Secs. 4–7 through 4–9). •The coverage of shock and impact loading is mathematically simpliﬁed by using an energy approach (Sec. 4–17). •The variable σrevis introduced to denote a completely reversed stress, avoiding confusion with σa, which is the amplitude of alternating stress about a mean stress (Sec. 6–8). •The method for determining notch sensitivity for shear loading is modiﬁed to be more consistent with currently available data (Sec. 6–10). •For tension-loaded bolts, the yielding factor of safety is deﬁned and distinguished from the load factor (Sec. 8–9). •The presentation of fatigue loading of bolted joints now handles general ﬂuctuating stresses, treating repeated loading as a special case (Sec. 8–11). •The notation for bearing life now distinguishes more clearly and consistently be- tween life in revolutions versus life in hours (Sec. 11–3). •The material on tapered roller bearings is generalized to emphasize the concepts and processes, and to be less dependent on speciﬁc manufacturer’s terminology (Sec. 11–9). •Streamlining for clarity to the student. There is a fine line between being compre- hensive and being cumbersome and confusing. It is a continual process to refine and maintain focus on the needs of the student. This text is first and foremost an educational tool for the initial presentation of its topics to the developing engi- neering student. Accordingly, the presentation has been examined with attentive- ness to how the beginning student would likely understand it. Also recognizing that this text is a valued reference for practicing engineers, the authors have en- deavored to keep the presentation complete, accurate, properly referenced, and straightforward.

pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:4 Mechanical Engineering Design Mechanical design is a complex process, requiring many skills. Extensive relationships need to be subdivided into a series of simple tasks. The complexity of the process requires a sequence in which ideas are introduced and iterated. We ﬁrst address the nature of design in general, and then mechanical engineering design in particular. Design is an iterative process with many interactive phases. Many resources exist to support the designer, including many sources of information and an abundance of computational design tools. Design engineers need not only develop com- petence in their ﬁeld but they must also cultivate a strong sense of responsibility and professional work ethic. There are roles to be played by codes and standards, ever-present economics, safety, and considerations of product liability. The survival of a mechanical component is often related through stress and strength. Matters of uncertainty are ever-present in engineer- ing design and are typically addressed by the design factor and factor of safety, either in the form of a deterministic (absolute) or statistical sense. The latter, statistical approach, deals with a design’s reliability and requires good statistical data. In mechanical design, other considerations include dimensions and tolerances, units, and calculations. The book consists of four parts. Part 1, Basics, begins by explaining some differ- ences between design and analysis and introducing some fundamental notions and approaches to design. It continues with three chapters reviewing material properties, stress analysis, and stiffness and deﬂection analysis, which are the principles necessary for the remainder of the book. Part 2, Failure Prevention, consists of two chapters on the prevention of failure of mechanical parts. Why machine parts fail and how they can be designed to prevent fail- ure are difﬁcult questions, and so we take two chapters to answer them, one on pre- venting failure due to static loads, and the other on preventing fatigue failure due to time-varying, cyclic loads. In Part 3, Design of Mechanical Elements, the concepts of Parts 1 and 2 are applied to the analysis, selection, and design of speciﬁc mechanical elements such as shafts, fasteners, weldments, springs, rolling contact bearings, ﬁlm bearings, gears, belts, chains, and wire ropes. Part 4, Analysis Tools, provides introductions to two important methods used in mechanical design, ﬁnite element analysis and statistical analysis. This is optional study material, but some sections and examples in Parts 1 to 3 demonstrate the use of these tools. There are two appendixes at the end of the book. Appendix A contains many use- ful tables referenced throughout the book. Appendix B contains answers to selected end-of-chapter problems. 1–1 Design To design is either to formulate a plan for the satisfaction of a speciﬁed need or to solve a speciﬁc problem. If the plan results in the creation of something having a physical reality, then the product must be functional, safe, reliable, competitive, usable, manu- facturable, and marketable. Design is an innovative and highly iterative process. It is also a decision-making process. Decisions sometimes have to be made with too little information, occasion- ally with just the right amount of information, or with an excess of partially contradictory information. Decisions are sometimes made tentatively, with the right reserved to adjust as more becomes known. The point is that the engineering designer has to be personally comfortable with a decision-making, problem-solving role.bud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Design 5 Design is a communication-intensive activity in which both words and pictures are used, and written and oral forms are employed. Engineers have to communicate effec- tively and work with people of many disciplines. These are important skills, and an engineer’s success depends on them. A designer’s personal resources of creativeness, communicative ability, and problem- solving skill are intertwined with the knowledge of technology and ﬁrst principles. Engineering tools (such as mathematics, statistics, computers, graphics, and languages) are combined to produce a plan that, when carried out, produces a product that is func- tional, safe, reliable, competitive, usable, manufacturable, and marketable, regardless of who builds it or who uses it. 1–2 Mechanical Engineering Design Mechanical engineers are associated with the production and processing of energy and with providing the means of production, the tools of transportation, and the techniques of automation. The skill and knowledge base are extensive. Among the disciplinary bases are mechanics of solids and ﬂuids, mass and momentum transport, manufactur- ing processes, and electrical and information theory. Mechanical engineering design involves all the disciplines of mechanical engineering. Real problems resist compartmentalization. A simple journal bearing involves ﬂuid ﬂow, heat transfer, friction, energy transport, material selection, thermomechanical treatments, statistical descriptions, and so on. A building is environmentally controlled. The heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning considerations are sufﬁciently specialized that some speak of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning design as if it is separate and distinct from mechanical engineering design. Similarly, internal-combustion engine design, turbomachinery design, and jet-engine design are sometimes considered dis- crete entities. Here, the leading string of words preceding the word design is merely a product descriptor. Similarly, there are phrases such as machine design, machine-element design, machine-component design, systems design, and ﬂuid-power design. All of these phrases are somewhat more focused examples of mechanical engineering design. They all draw on the same bodies of knowledge, are similarly organized, and require similar skills. 1–3 Phases and Interactions of the Design Process What is the design process? How does it begin? Does the engineer simply sit down at a desk with a blank sheet of paper and jot down some ideas? What happens next? What factors inﬂuence or control the decisions that have to be made? Finally, how does the design process end? The complete design process, from start to finish, is often outlined as in Fig. 1–1. The process begins with an identification of a need and a decision to do something about it. After many iterations, the process ends with the presentation of the plans for satisfying the need. Depending on the nature of the design task, several design phases may be repeated throughout the life of the product, from inception to termi- nation. In the next several subsections, we shall examine these steps in the design process in detail. Identiﬁcation of need generally starts the design process. Recognition of the need and phrasing the need often constitute a highly creative act, because the need may be only a vague discontent, a feeling of uneasiness, or a sensing that something is not right. The need is often not evident at all; recognition can be triggered by a particular adv ersebud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:6 Mechanical Engineering Design circumstance or a set of random circumstances that arises almost simultaneously. For example, the need to do something about a food-packaging machine may be indicated by the noise level, by a variation in package weight, and by slight but perceptible vari- ations in the quality of the packaging or wrap. There is a distinct difference between the statement of the need and the deﬁnition of the problem. The deﬁnition of problem is more speciﬁc and must include all the spec- iﬁcations for the object that is to be designed. The speciﬁcations are the input and out- put quantities, the characteristics and dimensions of the space the object must occupy, and all the limitations on these quantities. We can regard the object to be designed as something in a black box. In this case we must specify the inputs and outputs of the box, together with their characteristics and limitations. The speciﬁcations deﬁne the cost, the number to be manufactured, the expected life, the range, the operating temperature, and the reliability. Speciﬁed characteristics can include the speeds, feeds, temperature lim- itations, maximum range, expected variations in the variables, dimensional and weight limitations, etc. There are many implied specifications that result either from the designer’s par- ticular environment or from the nature of the problem itself. The manufacturing processes that are available, together with the facilities of a certain plant, constitute restrictions on a designer’s freedom, and hence are a part of the implied specifica- tions. It may be that a small plant, for instance, does not own cold-working machin- ery. Knowing this, the designer might select other metal-processing methods that can be performed in the plant. The labor skills available and the competitive situa- tion also constitute implied constraints. Anything that limits the designer’s freedom of choice is a constraint. Many materials and sizes are listed in supplier’s catalogs, for instance, but these are not all easily available and shortages frequently occur. Furthermore, inventory economics requires that a manufacturer stock a minimum number of materials and sizes. An example of a specification is given in Sec. 1–17. This example is for a case study of a power transmission that is presented throughout this text. The synthesis of a scheme connecting possible system elements is sometimes called the invention of the concept orconcept design . This is the ﬁrst and most impor- tant step in the synthesis task. Various schemes must be proposed, investigated, andFigure 1–1 The phases in design, acknowledging the many feedbacks and iterations.Identification of need Definition of problem Synthesis Analysis and optimization Evaluation PresentationIterationbud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Design 7 quantiﬁed in terms of established metrics.1As the ﬂeshing out of the scheme progresses, analyses must be performed to assess whether the system performance is satisfactory or better, and, if satisfactory, just how well it will perform. System schemes that do not survive analysis are revised, improved, or discarded. Those with potential are optimized to determine the best performance of which the scheme is capable. Competing schemes are compared so that the path leading to the most competitive product can be chosen. Figure 1–1 shows that synthesis and analysis and optimization are intimately and iteratively related. We have noted, and we emphasize, that design is an iterative process in which we proceed through several steps, evaluate the results, and then return to an earlier phase of the procedure. Thus, we may synthesize several components of a system, analyze and optimize them, and return to synthesis to see what effect this has on the remaining parts of the system. For example, the design of a system to transmit power requires attention to the design and selection of individual components (e.g., gears, bearings, shaft). However, as is often the case in design, these components are not independent. In order to design the shaft for stress and deﬂection, it is necessary to know the applied forces. If the forces are transmitted through gears, it is necessary to know the gear speciﬁca- tions in order to determine the forces that will be transmitted to the shaft. But stock gears come with certain bore sizes, requiring knowledge of the necessary shaft diame- ter. Clearly, rough estimates will need to be made in order to proceed through the process, reﬁning and iterating until a ﬁnal design is obtained that is satisfactory for each individual component as well as for the overall design speciﬁcations. Throughout the text we will elaborate on this process for the case study of a power transmission design. Both analysis and optimization require that we construct or devise abstract models of the system that will admit some form of mathematical analysis. We call these mod- els mathematical models. In creating them it is our hope that we can ﬁnd one that will simulate the real physical system very well. As indicated in Fig. 1–1, evaluation is a signiﬁcant phase of the total design process. Evaluation is the ﬁnal proof of a success- ful design and usually involves the testing of a prototype in the laboratory. Here we wish to discover if the design really satisﬁes the needs. Is it reliable? Will it compete successfully with similar products? Is it economical to manufacture and to use? Is it easily maintained and adjusted? Can a proﬁt be made from its sale or use? How likely is it to result in product-liability lawsuits? And is insurance easily and cheaply obtained? Is it likely that recalls will be needed to replace defective parts or systems? The project designer or design team will need to address a myriad of engineering and non-engineering questions. Communicating the design to others is the ﬁnal, vital presentation step in the design process. Undoubtedly, many great designs, inventions, and creative works have been lost to posterity simply because the originators were unable or unwilling to properly explain their accomplishments to others. Presentation is a selling job. The engineer, when presenting a new solution to administrative, management, or supervisory persons, is attempting to sell or to prove to them that their solution is a better one. Unless this can be done successfully, the time and effort spent on obtaining the solution have been largely wasted. When designers sell a new idea, they also sell themselves. If they are repeatedly successful in selling ideas, designs, and new solutions to management, they begin to receive salary increases and promotions; in fact, this is how anyone succeeds in his or her profession. 1An excellent reference for this topic is presented by Stuart Pugh, Total Design —Integrated Methods for Successful Product Engineering, Addison-Wesley, 1991. A description of the Pugh method is also provided in Chap. 8, David G. Ullman, The Mechanical Design Process, 3rd ed., McGraw-Hill, 2003.bud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:8 Mechanical Engineering Design Design Considerations Sometimes the strength required of an element in a system is an important factor in the determination of the geometry and the dimensions of the element. In such a situation we say that strength is an important design consideration . When we use the expression design consideration, we are referring to some characteristic that inﬂuences the design of the element or, perhaps, the entire system. Usually quite a number of such charac- teristics must be considered and prioritized in a given design situation. Many of the important ones are as follows (not necessarily in order of importance): 1Functionality 14 Noise 2Strength/stress 15 Styling 3Distortion/deﬂection/stiffness 16 Shape 4Wear 17 Size 5Corrosion 18 Control 6Safety 19 Thermal properties 7Reliability 20 Surface 8Manufacturability 21 Lubrication 9Utility 22 Marketability 10 Cost 23 Maintenance 11 Friction 24 V olume 12 Weight 25 Liability 13 Life 26 Remanufacturing/resource recovery Some of these characteristics have to do directly with the dimensions, the material, the processing, and the joining of the elements of the system. Several characteristics may be interrelated, which affects the conﬁguration of the total system. 1–4 Design Tools and Resources Today, the engineer has a great variety of tools and resources available to assist in the solution of design problems. Inexpensive microcomputers and robust computer soft- ware packages provide tools of immense capability for the design, analysis, and simu- lation of mechanical components. In addition to these tools, the engineer always needs technical information, either in the form of basic science/engineering behavior or the characteristics of speciﬁc off-the-shelf components. Here, the resources can range from science/engineering textbooks to manufacturers’ brochures or catalogs. Here too, the computer can play a major role in gathering information.2 Computational Tools Computer-aided design (CAD) software allows the development of three-dimensional (3-D) designs from which conventional two-dimensional orthographic views with auto- matic dimensioning can be produced. Manufacturing tool paths can be generated from the 3-D models, and in some cases, parts can be created directly from a 3-D database by using a rapid prototyping and manufacturing method (stereolithography)— paperless manufac- turing! Another advantage of a 3-D database is that it allows rapid and accurate calcula- tions of mass properties such as mass, location of the center of gravity, and mass moments of inertia. Other geometric properties such as areas and distances between points are likewise easily obtained. There are a great many CAD software packages available such 2An excellent and comprehensive discussion of the process of “gathering information” can be found in Chap. 4, George E. Dieter, Engineering Design, A Materials and Processing Approach, 3rd ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 2000.bud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Design 9 as Aries, AutoCAD, CadKey, I-Deas, Unigraphics, Solid Works, and ProEngineer, to name a few. The term computer-aided engineering (CAE) generally applies to all computer- related engineering applications. With this deﬁnition, CAD can be considered as a sub- set of CAE. Some computer software packages perform speciﬁc engineering analysis and/or simulation tasks that assist the designer, but they are not considered a tool for the creation of the design that CAD is. Such software ﬁts into two categories: engineering- based and non-engineering-speciﬁc. Some examples of engineering-based software for mechanical engineering applications—software that might also be integrated within a CAD system—include ﬁnite-element analysis (FEA) programs for analysis of stress and deﬂection (see Chap. 19), vibration, and heat transfer (e.g., Algor, ANSYS, and MSC/NASTRAN); computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) programs for ﬂuid-ﬂow analy- sis and simulation (e.g., CFD++, FIDAP, and Fluent); and programs for simulation of dynamic force and motion in mechanisms (e.g., ADAMS, DADS, and Working Model). Examples of non-engineering-speciﬁc computer-aided applications include software for word processing, spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel, Lotus, and Quattro-Pro), and mathematical solvers (e.g., Maple, MathCad, MATLAB,3Mathematica, and TKsolver). Your instructor is the best source of information about programs that may be available to you and can recommend those that are useful for speciﬁc tasks. One caution, however: Computer software is no substitute for the human thought process. Youare the driver here; the computer is the vehicle to assist you on your journey to a solution. Numbers generated by a computer can be far from the truth if you entered incorrect input, if you misinterpreted the application or the output of the program, if the program contained bugs, etc. It is your responsibility to assure the validity of the results, so be careful to check the application and results carefully, perform benchmark testing by submitting problems with known solu- tions, and monitor the software company and user-group newsletters. Acquiring Technical Information We currently live in what is referred to as the information age, where information is gen- erated at an astounding pace. It is difﬁcult, but extremely important, to keep abreast of past and current developments in one’s ﬁeld of study and occupation. The reference in Footnote 2 provides an excellent description of the informational resources available and is highly recommended reading for the serious design engineer. Some sources of information are: •Libraries (community, university, and private). Engineering dictionaries and encyclo- pedias, textbooks, monographs, handbooks, indexing and abstract services, journals, translations, technical reports, patents, and business sources/brochures/catalogs. •Government sources. Departments of Defense, Commerce, Energy, and Transportation; NASA; Government Printing Ofﬁce; U.S. Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce; National Technical Information Service; and National Institute for Standards and Technology. •Professional societies. American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Society of Manufacturing Engineers, Society of Automotive Engineers, American Society for Testing and Materials, and American Welding Society. •Commercial vendors. Catalogs, technical literature, test data, samples, and cost information. •Internet. The computer network gateway to websites associated with most of the categories listed above.4 3MATLAB is a registered trademark of The MathWorks, Inc. 4Some helpful Web resources, to name a few, include www.globalspec.com, www.engnetglobal.com, www.efunda.com, www.thomasnet.com, and www.uspto.gov.bud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:10 Mechanical Engineering Design This list is not complete. The reader is urged to explore the various sources of information on a regular basis and keep records of the knowledge gained. 1–5 The Design Engineer’s Professional Responsibilities In general, the design engineer is required to satisfy the needs of customers (man- agement, clients, consumers, etc.) and is expected to do so in a competent, responsi- ble, ethical, and professional manner. Much of engineering course work and practical experience focuses on competence, but when does one begin to develop engineering responsibility and professionalism? To start on the road to success, you should start to develop these characteristics early in your educational program. You need to cul- tivate your professional work ethic and process skills before graduation, so that when you begin your formal engineering career, you will be prepared to meet the challenges. It is not obvious to some students, but communication skills play a large role here, and it is the wise student who continuously works to improve these skills— even if it is not a direct requirement of a course assignment! Success in engineering (achieve- ments, promotions, raises, etc.) may in large part be due to competence but if you can- not communicate your ideas clearly and concisely, your technical proﬁciency may be compromised. You can start to develop your communication skills by keeping a neat and clear journal/logbook of your activities, entering dated entries frequently. (Many companies require their engineers to keep a journal for patent and liability concerns.) Separate journals should be used for each design project (or course subject). When starting a project or problem, in the deﬁnition stage, make journal entries quite frequently. Others, as well as yourself, may later question why you made certain decisions. Good chrono- logical records will make it easier to explain your decisions at a later date. Many engineering students see themselves after graduation as practicing engineers designing, developing, and analyzing products and processes and consider the need of good communication skills, either oral or writing, as secondary. This is far from the truth. Most practicing engineers spend a good deal of time communicating with others, writing proposals and technical reports, and giving presentations and interacting with engineering and nonengineering support personnel. You have the time now to sharpen your communication skills. When given an assignment to write or make any presenta- tion, technical ornontechnical, accept it enthusiastically, and work on improving your communication skills. It will be time well spent to learn the skills now rather than on the job. When you are working on a design problem, it is important that you develop a systematic approach. Careful attention to the following action steps will help you to organize your solution processing technique. •Understand the problem. Problem deﬁnition is probably the most signiﬁcant step in the engineering design process. Carefully read, understand, and reﬁne the problem statement. •Identify the knowns. From the reﬁned problem statement, describe concisely what information is known and relevant. •Identify the unknowns and formulate the solution strategy. State what must be deter- mined, in what order, so as to arrive at a solution to the problem. Sketch the compo- nent or system under investigation, identifying known and unknown parameters. Create a ﬂowchart of the steps necessary to reach the ﬁnal solution. The steps may require the use of free-body diagrams; material properties from tables; equationsbud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Design 11 from ﬁrst principles, textbooks, or handbooks relating the known and unknown parameters; experimentally or numerically based charts; speciﬁc computational tools as discussed in Sec. 1–4; etc. •State all assumptions and decisions. Real design problems generally do not have unique, ideal, closed-form solutions. Selections, such as the choice of materials, and heat treatments, require decisions. Analyses require assumptions related to the modeling of the real components or system. All assumptions and decisions should be identiﬁed and recorded. •Analyze the problem. Using your solution strategy in conjunction with your decisions and assumptions, execute the analysis of the problem. Reference the sources of all equations, tables, charts, software results, etc. Check the credibility of your results. Check the order of magnitude, dimensionality, trends, signs, etc. •Evaluate your solution. Evaluate each step in the solution, noting how changes in strat- egy, decisions, assumptions, and execution might change the results, in positive or neg- ative ways. Whenever possible, incorporate the positive changes in your ﬁnal solution. •Present your solution. Here is where your communication skills are important. At this point, you are selling yourself and your technical abilities. If you cannot skill- fully explain what you have done, some or all of your work may be misunderstood and unaccepted. Know your audience. As stated earlier, all design processes are interactive and iterative. Thus, it may be nec- essary to repeat some or all of the above steps more than once if less than satisfactory results are obtained. In order to be effective, all professionals must keep current in their ﬁelds of endeavor. The design engineer can satisfy this in a number of ways by: being an active member of a professional society such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), and the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME); attending meetings, conferences, and seminars of societies, manufacturers, universities, etc.; taking speciﬁc graduate courses or programs at universities; regularly reading technical and professional journals; etc. An engineer’s education does not end at graduation. The design engineer’s professional obligations include conducting activities in an ethical manner. Reproduced here is the Engineers’ Creed from the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE)5: As a Professional Engineer I dedicate my professional knowledge and skill to the advancement and betterment of human welfare. I pledge: To give the utmost of performance; To participate in none but honest enterprise; To live and work according to the laws of man and the highest standards of pro- fessional conduct; To place service before proﬁt, the honor and standing of the profession before personal advantage, and the public welfare above all other considerations. In humility and with need for Divine Guidance, I make this pledge. 5Adopted by the National Society of Professional Engineers, June 1954. “The Engineer’s Creed.” Reprinted by permission of the National Society of Professional Engineers. NSPE also publishes a much more extensive Code of Ethics for Engineers with rules of practice and professional obligations.

One of the important purposes of a standard is to limit the multitude of variations that can arise from the arbitrary cre- ation of a part, material, or process. A code is a set of speciﬁcations for the analysis, design, manufacture, and con- struction of something. The purpose of a code is to achieve a speciﬁed degree of safety, efﬁciency, and performance or quality. It is important to observe that safety codes do notimply absolute safety. In fact, absolute safety is impossible to obtain. Sometimes the unexpected event really does happen. Designing a building to withstand a 120 mi/h wind does not mean that the designers think a 140 mi/h wind is impossible; it simply means that they think it is highly improbable. All of the organizations and societies listed below have established speciﬁcations for standards and safety or design codes. The name of the organization provides a clue to the nature of the standard or code. Some of the standards and codes, as well as addresses, can be obtained in most technical libraries or on the Internet. The organiza- tions of interest to mechanical engineers are: Aluminum Association (AA) American Bearing Manufacturers Association (ABMA) American Gear Manufacturers Association (AGMA) American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) American National Standards Institute (ANSI) American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) American Welding Society (AWS) ASM International British Standards Institution (BSI) Industrial Fasteners Institute (IFI) Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) International Federation of Robotics (IFR) International Standards Organization (ISO) National Association of Power Engineers (NAPE) National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) 1–7 Economics The consideration of cost plays such an important role in the design decision process that we could easily spend as much time in studying the cost factor as in the study of the entire subject of design. Here we introduce only a few general concepts and sim- ple rules. First, observe that nothing can be said in an absolute sense concerning costs. Materials and labor usually show an increasing cost from year to year. But the costsbud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:of processing the materials can be expected to exhibit a decreasing trend because of the use of automated machine tools and robots. The cost of manufacturing a single product will vary from city to city and from one plant to another because of over- head, labor, taxes, and freight differentials and the inevitable slight manufacturing variations. Standard Sizes The use of standard or stock sizes is a ﬁrst principle of cost reduction. An engineer who speciﬁes an AISI 1020 bar of hot-rolled steel 53 mm square has added cost to the prod- uct, provided that a bar 50 or 60 mm square, both of which are preferred sizes, would do equally well. The 53-mm size can be obtained by special order or by rolling or machining a 60-mm square, but these approaches add cost to the product. To ensure that standard or preferred sizes are speciﬁed, designers must have access to stock lists of the materials they employ. A further word of caution regarding the selection of preferred sizes is necessary. Although a great many sizes are usually listed in catalogs, they are not all readily avail- able. Some sizes are used so infrequently that they are not stocked. A rush order for such sizes may add to the expense and delay. Thus you should also have access to a list such as those in Table A–17 for preferred inch and millimeter sizes. There are many purchased parts, such as motors, pumps, bearings, and fasteners, that are speciﬁed by designers. In the case of these, too, you should make a special effort to specify parts that are readily available. Parts that are made and sold in large quantities usually cost somewhat less than the odd sizes. The cost of rolling bearings, for example, depends more on the quantity of production by the bearing manufacturer than on the size of the bearing. Large Tolerances Among the effects of design speciﬁcations on costs, tolerances are perhaps most sig- niﬁcant. Tolerances, manufacturing processes, and surface ﬁnish are interrelated and inﬂuence the producibility of the end product in many ways. Close tolerances may necessitate additional steps in processing and inspection or even render a part com- pletely impractical to produce economically. Tolerances cover dimensional variation and surface-roughness range and also the variation in mechanical properties resulting from heat treatment and other processing operations. Since parts having large tolerances can often be produced by machines with higher production rates, costs will be significantly smaller. Also, fewer such parts will be rejected in the inspection process, and they are usually easier to assemble. A plot of cost versus tolerance/machining process is shown in Fig. 1–2, and illustrates the drastic increase in manufacturing cost as tolerance diminishes with finer machining processing. Breakeven Points Sometimes it happens that, when two or more design approaches are compared for cost, the choice between the two depends on a set of conditions such as the quantity of pro- duction, the speed of the assembly lines, or some other condition. There then occurs a point corresponding to equal cost, which is called the breakeven point.Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Design 13bud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:14 Mechanical Engineering Design As an example, consider a situation in which a certain part can be manufactured at the rate of 25 parts per hour on an automatic screw machine or 10 parts per hour on a hand screw machine. Let us suppose, too, that the setup time for the automatic is 3 h and that the labor cost for either machine is $20 per hour, including overhead. Figure 1–3 is a graph of cost versus production by the two methods. The breakeven point for this example corresponds to 50 parts. If the desired production is greater than 50 parts, the automatic machine should be used.Figure 1–2 Cost versus tolerance/ machining process. (From David G. Ullman, The Mechanical Design Process, 3rd ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 2003.)

A certain amount of judgment may be required in some instances. For example, we can compare the relative value of two automobiles by comparing the dollar cost per pound of weight. Another way to compare the cost of one design with another is simply to count the number of parts. The design having the smaller number of parts is likely to cost less. Many other cost estimators can be used, depending upon the application, such as area, volume, horsepower, torque, capacity, speed, and various performance ratios.6 1–8 Safety and Product Liability The strict liability concept of product liability generally prevails in the United States. This concept states that the manufacturer of an article is liable for any damage or harm that results because of a defect. And it doesn’t matter whether the manufacturer knew about the defect, or even could have known about it. For example, suppose an article was manufactured, say, 10 years ago. And suppose at that time the article could not have been considered defective on the basis of all technological knowledge then available. Ten years later, according to the concept of strict liability, the manufacturer is still liable. Thus, under this concept, the plaintiff needs only to prove that the article was defective and that the defect caused some damage or harm. Negligence of the manu- facturer need not be proved. The best approaches to the prevention of product liability are good engineering in analysis and design, quality control, and comprehensive testing procedures. Advertising managers often make glowing promises in the warranties and sales literature for a prod- uct. These statements should be reviewed carefully by the engineering staff to eliminate excessive promises and to insert adequate warnings and instructions for use. 1–9 Stress and Strength The survival of many products depends on how the designer adjusts the maximum stresses in a component to be less than the component’s strength at critical locations. The designer must allow the maximum stress to be less than the strength by a sufﬁcient margin so that despite the uncertainties, failure is rare. In focusing on the stress-strength comparison at a critical (controlling) location, we often look for “strength in the geometry and condition of use.” Strengths are the magnitudes of stresses at which something of interest occurs, such as the proportional limit, 0.2 percent-offset yielding, or fracture (see Sec. 2–1). In many cases, such events represent the stress level at which loss of function occurs. Strength is a property of a material or of a mechanical element. The strength of an element depends on the choice, the treatment, and the processing of the material. Consider, for example, a shipment of springs. We can associate a strength with a spe- ciﬁc spring. When this spring is incorporated into a machine, external forces are applied that result in load-induced stresses in the spring, the magnitudes of which depend on its geometry and are independent of the material and its processing. If the spring is removed from the machine unharmed, the stress due to the external forces will return 6For an overview of estimating manufacturing costs, see Chap. 11, Karl T. Ulrich and Steven D. Eppinger, Product Design and Development, 3rd ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 2004.bud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:16 Mechanical Engineering Design to zero. But the strength remains as one of the properties of the spring. Remember, then, that strength is an inherent property of a part, a property built into the part because of the use of a particular material and process. Various metalworking and heat-treating processes, such as forging, rolling, and cold forming, cause variations in the strength from point to point throughout a part. The spring cited above is quite likely to have a strength on the outside of the coils different from its strength on the inside because the spring has been formed by a cold winding process, and the two sides may not have been deformed by the same amount. Remember, too, therefore, that a strength value given for a part may apply to only a par- ticular point or set of points on the part. In this book we shall use the capital letter Sto denote strength, with appropriate subscripts to denote the type of strength. Thus, Syis a yield strength, Suan ultimate strength, Ssya shear yield strength, and Sean endurance strength. In accordance with accepted engineering practice, we shall employ the Greek let- ters σ(sigma) and τ(tau) to designate normal and shear stresses, respectively. Again, various subscripts will indicate some special characteristic. For example, σ1is a princi- pal normal stress, σya normal stress component in the ydirection, and σra normal stress component in the radial direction. Stress is a state property at a speciﬁc point within a body, which is a function of load, geometry, temperature, and manufacturing processing. In an elementary course in mechanics of materials, stress related to load and geometry is emphasized with some discussion of thermal stresses. However, stresses due to heat treatments, molding, assembly, etc. are also important and are sometimes neglected. A review of stress analy- sis for basic load states and geometry is given in Chap. 3. 1–10 Uncertainty Uncertainties in machinery design abound. Examples of uncertainties concerning stress and strength include •Composition of material and the effect of variation on properties. •Variations in properties from place to place within a bar of stock. •Effect of processing locally, or nearby, on properties. •Effect of nearby assemblies such as weldments and shrink ﬁts on stress conditions. •Effect of thermomechanical treatment on properties. •Intensity and distribution of loading. •Validity of mathematical models used to represent reality. •Intensity of stress concentrations. •Inﬂuence of time on strength and geometry. •Effect of corrosion. •Effect of wear. •Uncertainty as to the length of any list of uncertainties. Engineers must accommodate uncertainty. Uncertainty always accompanies change. Material properties, load variability, fabrication ﬁdelity, and validity of mathematical models are among concerns to designers. There are mathematical methods to address uncertainties. The primary techniques are the deterministic and stochastic methods. The deterministic method establishes a design factor based on the absolute uncertainties of a loss-of-function parameter and abud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Design 17 maximum allowable parameter. Here the parameter can be load, stress, deﬂection, etc. Thus, the design factor ndis deﬁned as nd=loss-of-function parameter maximum allowable parameter(1–1) If the parameter is load, then the maximum allowable load can be found from Maximum allowable load =loss-of-function load nd(1–2) EXAMPLE 1–1 Consider that the maximum load on a structure is known with an uncertainty of ±20per- cent, and the load causing f ailure is known within ±15percent. If the load causing fail- ure is nominally 2000 lbf, determine the design factor and the maximum allowable load that will offset the absolute uncertainties. Solution To account for its uncertainty, the loss-of-function load must increase to 1 /0.85, whereas the maximum allowable load must decrease to 1 /1.2. Thus to offset the absolute uncer- tainties the design factor, from Eq. (1–1), should be Answer nd=1/0.85 1/1.2=1.4 From Eq. (1–2), the maximum allowable load is found to be Answer Maximum allowable load =2000 1.4=1400 lbf Stochastic methods (see Chap. 20) are based on the statistical nature of the design parameters and focus on the probability of survival of the design’s function (that is, on reliability). Sections 5–13 and 6–17 demonstrate how this is accomplished. 1–11 Design Factor and Factor of Safety A general approach to the allowable load versus loss-of-function load problem is the deterministic design factor method, and sometimes called the classical method of design. The fundamental equation is Eq. (1–1) where ndis called the design factor. All loss-of-function modes must be analyzed, and the mode leading to the smallest design factor governs. After the design is completed, the actual design factor may change as a result of changes such as rounding up to a standard size for a cross section or using off-the-shelf components with higher ratings instead of employing what is calculated by using the design factor. The factor is then referred to as the factor of safety, n. The factor of safety has the same deﬁnition as the design factor, but it generally differs numerically. Since stress may not vary linearly with load (see Sec. 3–19), using load as the loss-of- function parameter may not be acceptable. It is more common then to express the design factor in terms of a stress and a relevant strength. Thus Eq. (1–1) can be rewritten as nd=loss-of-function strength allowable stress=S σ(orτ)(1–3)bud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:18 Mechanical Engineering Design The stress and strength terms in Eq. (1–3) must be of the same type and units. Also, the stress and strength must apply to the same critical location in the part. EXAMPLE 1–2 A rod with a cross-sectional area of Aand loaded in tension with an axial force of P/H11005 2000 lbf undergoes a stress of σ=P/A.Using a material strength of 24 kpsi and a design factor of 3.0, determine the minimum diameter of a solid circular rod. Using Table A–17, select a preferred fractional diameter and determine the rod’s factor of safety . Solution Since A=πd2/4,σ=P/A, and from Eq. (1–3), σ=S/nd,then σ=P A=P πd2/4=S nd Solving for dyields Answer d=/parenleftbigg4Pnd πS/parenrightbigg1/2 =/parenleftbigg4(2000)3 π(24 000)/parenrightbigg1/2 =0.564 in From Table A–17, the next higher preferred size is 5 8in /H110050.625 in. Thus, when ndis replaced with nin the equation developed above, the factor of safety nis Answer n=πSd2 4P=π(24 000)0 .6252 4(2000)=3.68 Thus rounding the diameter has increased the actual design factor. 1–12 Reliability In these days of greatly increasing numbers of liability lawsuits and the need to conform to regulations issued by governmental agencies such as EPA and OSHA, it is very important for the designer and the manufacturer to know the reliability of their product. The reliabil- ity method of design is one in which we obtain the distribution of stresses and the distribu- tion of strengths and then relate these two in order to achieve an acceptable success rate. The statistical measure of the probability that a mechanical element will not fail in use is called the reliability of that element. The reliability Rcan be expressed by R =1/H11002pf (1–4) where pfis the probability of failure, given by the number of instances of failures per total number of possible instances. The value of Rfalls in the range 0 /H11349R/H113491. A reli- ability of R=0.90means that there is a 90 percent chance that the part will perform its proper function without failure. The failure of 6 parts out of ev ery 1000 manufactured might be considered an acceptable failure rate for a certain class of products. This rep- resents a reliability of R=1−6 1000=0.994 or 99.4 percent. In the reliability method of design, the designer’s task is to make a judicious selec- tion of materials, processes, and geometry (size) so as to achieve a speciﬁc reliabilitybud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:goal. Thus, if the objective reliability is to be 99.4 percent, as above, what combination of materials, processing, and dimensions is needed to meet this goal? If a mechanical system fails when any one component fails, the system is said to be a series system. If the reliability of component iis Riin a series system of ncomponents, then the relia- bility of the system is given by R=n/summationdisplay i=1Ri (1–5) For example, consider a shaft with two bearings having reliabilities of 95 percent and 98 percent. From Eq. (1–5), the overall reliability of the shaft system is then R =R1R2=0.95 (0.98) =0.93 or 93 percent. Analyses that lead to an assessment of reliability address uncertainties, or their estimates, in parameters that describe the situation. Stochastic variables such as stress, strength, load, or size are described in terms of their means, standard deviations, and distributions. If bearing balls are produced by a manufacturing process in which a diameter distribution is created, we can say upon choosing a ball that there is uncertainty as to size. If we wish to consider weight or moment of inertia in rolling, this size uncer- tainty can be considered to be propagated to our knowledge of weight or inertia. There are ways of estimating the statistical parameters describing weight and inertia from those describing size and density. These methods are variously called propagation of error, propagation of uncertainty, or propagation of dispersion. These methods are integral parts of analysis or synthesis tasks when probability of failure is involved. It is important to note that good statistical data and estimates are essential to per- form an acceptable reliability analysis. This requires a good deal of testing and valida- tion of the data. In many cases, this is not practical and a deterministic approach to the design must be undertaken. 1–13 Dimensions and Tolerances The following terms are used generally in dimensioning: •Nominal size. The size we use in speaking of an element. For example, we may spec- ify a 11 2-in pipe or a 1 2-in bolt. Either the theoretical size or the actual measured size may be quite different. The theoretical size of a 11 2-in pipe is 1.900 in for the outside diameter. And the diameter of the 1 2-in bolt, say, may actually measure 0.492 in. •Limits. The stated maximum and minimum dimensions. •Tolerance. The difference between the two limits. •Bilateral tolerance. The variation in both directions from the basic dimension. That is, the basic size is between the two limits, for example, 1.005±0.002in. The two parts of the tolerance need not be equal. •Unilateral tolerance. The basic dimension is taken as one of the limits, and variation is permitted in only one direction, for example, 1.005+0.004 −0.000in •Clearance. A general term that refers to the mating of cylindrical parts such as a bolt and a hole. The word clearance is used only when the internal member is smaller than the external member. The diametral clearance is the measured difference in the two diameters. The radial clearance is the difference in the two radii.Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Design 19bud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:20 Mechanical Engineering Design EXAMPLE 1–3 A shouldered screw contains three hollow right circular cylindrical parts on the screw before a nut is tightened against the shoulder. To sustain the function, the gap wmust equal or exceed 0.003 in. The parts in the assembly depicted in Fig. 1–4 have dimen- sions and tolerances as follows: a=1.750±0.003 in b=0.750±0.001 in c=0.120±0.005 in d=0.875±0.001 in Figure 1–4 An assembly of three cylindrical sleeves of lengths a, b, and con a shoulder bolt shank of length a.The gap wis of interest.a b c d w All parts except the part with the dimension dare supplied by vendors.

The opposite of clearance, for mating cylindrical parts in which the internal member is larger than the external member (e.g., press-ﬁts). •Allowance. The minimum stated clearance or the maximum stated interference for mating parts. When several parts are assembled, the gap (or interference) depends on the dimen- sions and tolerances of the individual parts.bud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Design 21 The previous example represented an absolute tolerance system. Statistically, gap dimensions near the gap limits are rare events. Using a statistical tolerance system, the probability that the gap falls within a given limit is determined.7This probability deals with the statistical distributions of the individual dimensions. For example, if the distri- butions of the dimensions in the previous example were normal and the tolerances, t, were given in terms of standard deviations of the dimension distribution, the standard devia- tion of the gap ¯wwould be tw=/radicalbigg/summationdisplay allt2. However, this assumes a normal distribution for the individual dimensions, a rare occurrence. To ﬁnd the distribution of wand/or the probability of observing values of wwithin certain limits requires a computer simulation in most cases. Monte Carlo computer simulations are used to determine the distribution of wby the following approach: 1Generate an instance for each dimension in the problem by selecting the value of each dimension based on its probability distribution. 2Calculate wusing the values of the dimensions obtained in step 1. 3 Repeat steps 1 and 2 Ntimes to generate the distribution of w. As the number of trials increases, the reliability of the distribution increases. 1–14 Units In the symbolic units equation for Newton’s second law, F /H11005ma, F=MLT−2(1–6) Fstands for force, Mfor mass, Lfor length, and Tfor time. Units chosen for anythree of these quantities are called base units. The ﬁrst three having been chosen, the fourth unit is called a derived unit. When force, length, and time are chosen as base units, the mass is the derived unit and the system that results is called a gravitational system of units . When mass, length, and time are chosen as base units, force is the derived unit and the system that results is called an absolute system of units . In some English-speaking countries, the U.S. customary foot-pound-second system (fps) and the inch-pound-second system (ips) are the two standard gravitational systems most used by engineers. In the fps system the unit of mass is M=FT2 L=(pound-force)(second)2 foot=lbf·s2/ft=slug (1–7) Thus, length, time, and force are the three base units in the fps gravitational system. The unit of force in the fps system is the pound, more properly the pound-force. We shall often abbreviate this unit as lbf; the abbreviation lb is permissible however, since we shall be dealing only with the U.S. customary gravitational system. In some branches of engineering it is useful to represent 1000 lbf as a kilopound and to abbreviate it as kip. Note: In Eq. (1–7) the derived unit of mass in the fps gravitational system is the lbf·s2/ft and is called a slug; there is no abbreviation for slug. The unit of mass in the ips gravitational system is M=FT2 L=(pound-force)(second)2 inch=lbf·s2/in (1–8) The mass unit lbf·s2/in has no ofﬁcial name. 7See Chapter 20 for a description of the statistical terminology.bud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:22 Mechanical Engineering Design The International System of Units (SI) is an absolute system. The base units are the meter, the kilogram (for mass), and the second. The unit of force is derived by using Newton’s second law and is called the newton. The units constituting the newton (N) are F=ML T2=(kilogram )(meter) (second )2=kg·m/s2=N (1–9) The weight of an object is the force exerted upon it by gravity. Designating the weight as Wand the acceleration due to gravity as g, we have W=mg (1–10) In the fps system, standard gravity is g/H1100532.1740 ft/s2. For most cases this is rounded off to 32.2. Thus the weight of a mass of 1 slug in the fps system is W=mg=(1 slug)(32 .2f t/s2)=32.2 lbf In the ips system, standard gravity is 386.088 or about 386 in/s2. Thus, in this system, a unit mass weighs W=(1 lbf·s2/in)(386 in/s2)=386 lbf With SI units, standard gravity is 9.806 or about 9.81 m/s. Thus, the weight of a 1-kg mass is W=(1 kg)(9 .81 m/s2)=9.81 N A series of names and symbols to form multiples and submultiples of SI units has been established to provide an alternative to the writing of powers of 10. Table A–1 includes these preﬁxes and symbols. Numbers having four or more digits are placed in groups of three and separated by a space instead of a comma. However, the space may be omitted for the special case of numbers having four digits. A period is used as a decimal point. These recommenda- tions avoid the confusion caused by certain European countries in which a comma is used as a decimal point, and by the English use of a centered period. Examples of correct and incorrect usage are as follows: 1924 or 1 924 but not 1,924 0.1924 or 0.192 4 but not 0.192,4 192 423.618 50 but not 192,423.61850 The decimal point should always be preceded by a zero for numbers less than unity. 1–15 Calculations and Signiﬁcant Figures The discussion in this section applies to real numbers, not integers. The accuracy of a real number depends on the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures describing the number. Usually, but not always, three or four signiﬁcant ﬁgures are necessary for engineering accuracy. Unless otherwise stated, no less than three signiﬁcant ﬁgures should be used in your calculations. The number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures is usually inferred by the number of ﬁgures given (except for leading zeros). For example, 706, 3.14, and 0.002 19 are assumed to bebud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:numbers with three signiﬁcant ﬁgures. For trailing zeros, a little more clariﬁcation is nec- essary. To display 706 to four signiﬁcant ﬁgures insert a trailing zero and display either 706.0,7.060×102,or 0.7060×103. Also, consider a number such as 91 600. Scientiﬁc notation should be used to clarify the accuracy. For three signiﬁcant ﬁgures express the number as 91.6×103. For four signiﬁcant ﬁgures express it as 91.60×103. Computers and calculators display calculations to many signiﬁcant ﬁgures. However, you should never report a number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures of a calculation any greater than the smallest number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures of the numbers used for the calculation. Of course, you should use the greatest accuracy possible when performing a calculation. For example, determine the circumference of a solid shaft with a diameter of d=0.40in. The circumference is given by C=πd. Since dis given with two signiﬁcant ﬁgures, Cshould be reported with only two signiﬁcant ﬁgures. Now if we used only two signiﬁcant ﬁgures for πour calculator would give C=3.1(0.40)=1.24in. This rounds off to two signif- icant ﬁgures as C=1.2in. However, using π=3.141 592 654 as programmed in the calculator, C=3.141 592 654 (0.40)=1.256 637 061 in. This rounds off to C=1.3 in, which is 8.3 percent higher than the ﬁrst calculation. Note, however, since dis given with two signiﬁcant ﬁgures, it is implied that the range of dis 0.40±0.005. This means that the calculation of Cis only accurate to within ±0.005/0.40=±0.0125=±1.25% . The calculation could also be one in a series of calculations, and rounding each calcula- tion separately may lead to an accumulation of greater inaccuracy. Thus, it is considered good engineering practice to make all calculations to the greatest accuracy possible and report the results within the accuracy of the given input. 1–16 Design Topic Interdependencies One of the characteristics of machine design problems is the interdependencies of the various elements of a given mechanical system. For example, a change from a spur gear to a helical gear on a drive shaft would add axial components of force, which would have implications on the layout and size of the shaft, and the type and size of the bear- ings. Further, even within a single component, it is necessary to consider many differ- ent facets of mechanics and failure modes, such as excessive deﬂection, static yielding, fatigue failure, contact stress, and material characteristics. However, in order to provide signiﬁcant attention to the details of each topic, most machine design textbooks focus on these topics separately and give end-of-chapter problems that relate only to that speciﬁc topic. To help the reader see the interdependence between the various design topics, this textbook presents many ongoing and interdependent problems in the end-of-chapter problem sections. Each row of Table 1–1 shows the problem numbers that apply to the same mechanical system that is being analyzed according to the topics being presented in that particular chapter. For example, in the second row, Probs. 3–40, 5-65, and 5–66 correspond to a pin in a knuckle joint that is to be analyzed for stresses in Chap. 3 and then for static failure in Chap. 5. This is a simple example of interdependencies, but as can be seen in the table, other systems are analyzed with as many as 10 separate prob- lems. It may be beneﬁcial to work through some of these continuing sequences as the topics are covered to increase your awareness of the various interdependencies. In addition to the problems given in Table 1–1, Sec. 1–17 describes a power trans- mission case study where various interdependent analyses are performed throughout the book, when appropriate in the presentation of the topics. The ﬁnal results of the case study are then presented in Chap. 18.Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Design 23bud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/11/2009 5:35 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:24 Mechanical Engineering Design 1–17 Power Transmission Case Study Speciﬁcations A case study incorporating the many facets of the design process for a power transmis- sion speed reducer will be considered throughout this textbook. The problem will be introduced here with the deﬁnition and speciﬁcation for the product to be designed. Further details and component analysis will be presented in subsequent chapters. Chapter 18 provides an overview of the entire process, focusing on the design sequence, the interaction between the component designs, and other details pertinent to transmis- sion of power. It also contains a complete case study of the power transmission speed reducer introduced here. Many industrial applications require machinery to be powered by engines or elec- tric motors. The power source usually runs most efﬁciently at a narrow range of rota- tional speed. When the application requires power to be delivered at a slower speed than supplied by the motor, a speed reducer is introduced. The speed reducer should trans- mit the power from the motor to the application with as little energy loss as practical, while reducing the speed and consequently increasing the torque. For example, assume that a company wishes to provide off-the-shelf speed reducers in various capacities and speed ratios to sell to a wide variety of target applications. The marketing team hasTable 1–1 Problem Numbers for Linked End-of-Chapter Problems* 3–1 4–50 4–74 3–40 5–65 5–66 3–68 4–23 4–29 4–35 5–39 6–37 7–7 11–14 3–69 4–24 4–30 4–36 5–40 6–38 7–8 11–15 3–70 4–25 4–31 4–37 5–41 6–39 7–9 11–16 3–71 4–26 4–32 4–38 5–42 6–40 7–10 11–17 3–72 4–27 4–33 4–39 5–43 6–41 7–11 7–19 7–20 7–34 11–27 11–28 13–38 14–36 3–73 4–28 4–34 4–40 5–44 6–42 7–12 7–21 7–22 7–35 11–29 11–30 13–39 14–37 3–74 5–45 6–43 7–13 11–41 13–42 3–76 5–46 6–44 7–14 11–42 13–42 3–77 5–47 6–45 7–15 11–18 13–40 14–38 3–79 5–48 6–46 7–16 11–19 13–41 14–39 3–80 4–41 4–71 5–49 6–47 3–81 5–50 6–48 3–82 5–51 6–49 3–83 5–52 6–50 3–84 4–43 4–73 5–53 5–56 6–51 3–85 5–54 6–52 3–86 5–55 6–53 3–87 5–56 *Each row corresponds to the same mechanical component repeated for a different design concept.bud29281_ch01_002-030.qxd 11/12/2009 6:40 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:determined a need for one of these speed reducers to satisfy the following customer requirements. Design Requirements Power to be delivered: 20 hp Input speed: 1750 rev/min Output speed: 85 rev/min Targeted for uniformly loaded applications, such as conveyor belts, blowers, and generators Output shaft and input shaft in-line Base mounted with 4 bolts Continuous operation 6-year life, with 8 hours/day, 5 days/wk Low maintenance Competitive cost Nominal operating conditions of industrialized locations Input and output shafts standard size for typical couplings In reality, the company would likely design for a whole range of speed ratios for each power capacity, obtainable by interchanging gear sizes within the same overall design. For simplicity, in this case study only one speed ratio will be considered. Notice that the list of customer requirements includes some numerical speciﬁcs, but also includes some generalized requirements, e.g., low maintenance and competitive cost. These general requirements give some guidance on what needs to be considered in the design process, but are difﬁcult to achieve with any certainty. In order to pin down these nebulous requirements, it is best to further develop the customer requirements into a set of product speciﬁcations that are measurable. This task is usually achieved through the work of a team including engineering, marketing, management, and customers. Various tools may be used (see footnote 1, p. 7) to prioritize the requirements, determine suitable metrics to be achieved, and to establish target values for each metric. The goal of this process is to obtain a product speciﬁcation that identiﬁes precisely what the product must satisfy. The following product speciﬁcations provide an appropriate framework for this design task.

The decision is usually made before the dimensions of the part are established. After choosing the process of creat- ing the desired geometry and the material (the two cannot be divorced), the designer can proportion the member so that loss of function can be avoided or the chance of loss of function can be held to an acceptable risk. In Chaps. 3 and 4, methods for estimating stresses and deﬂections of machine members are presented. These estimates are based on the properties of the material from which the member will be made. For deﬂections and stability evaluations, for example, the elastic (stiffness) properties of the material are required, and evaluations of stress at a critical location in a machine member require a comparison with the strength of the material at that location in the geometry and condition of use. This strength is a material property found by testing and is adjusted to the geometry and con- dition of use as necessary. As important as stress and deﬂection are in the design of mechanical parts, the selection of a material is not always based on these factors. Many parts carry no loads on them whatever. Parts may be designed merely to ﬁll up space or for aesthetic quali- ties. Members must frequently be designed to also resist corrosion. Sometimes temper- ature effects are more important in design than stress and strain. So many other factors besides stress and strain may govern the design of parts that the designer must have the versatility that comes only with a broad background in materials and processes. 2–1 Material Strength and Stiffness The standard tensile test is used to obtain a variety of material characteristics and strengths that are used in design. Figure 2–l illustrates a typical tension-test specimen and its characteristic dimensions.1The original diameter d0and the gauge length l0, used to measure the deﬂections, are recorded before the test is begun. The specimen is then mounted in the test machine and slowly loaded in tension while the load Pand deﬂection are observed. The load is converted to stress by the calculation σ=P A0(2–1) where A0=1 4πd2 0is the original area of the specimen. d0 l0PP Figure 2–1 A typical tension-test specimen.

No permanent set will be observable in the specimen if the load is removed at this point. In the linear range, the uniaxial stress-strain relation is given by Hooke’s law as σ=E/epsilon1 (2–3) where the constant of proportionality E, the slope of the linear part of the stress-strain curve, is called Young’s modulus or the modulus of elasticity . Eis a measure of the stiffness of a material, and since strain is dimensionless, the units of Eare the same as stress. Steel, for example, has a modulus of elasticity of about 30 Mpsi (207 GPa) regardless of heat treatment, carbon content, or alloying. Stainless steel is about 27.5 Mpsi (190 GPa). Point elin Fig. 2–2 is called the elastic limit . If the specimen is loaded beyond this point, the deformation is said to be plastic and the material will take on a permanent set when the load is removed. Between pl and elthe diagram is not a perfectly straight line, even though the specimen is elastic. During the tension test, many materials reach a point at which the strain begins to increase very rapidly without a corresponding increase in stress. This point is called the yield point. Not all materials have an obvious yield point, especially for brittle materials. For this reason, yield strength Syis often deﬁned by an offset method as shown in Fig. 2–2, where line ayis drawn at slope E.Point acorresponds to a deﬁnite or stated amount of permanent set, usually 0.2 percent of the original gauge length (/epsilon1=0.002), although 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5 percent are sometimes used. The ultimate, or tensile, strength Suor Sutcorresponds to point u in Fig. 2–2 and is the maximum stress reached on the stress-strain diagram.2As shown in Fig. 2–2 a,bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/12/2009 7:59 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:34 Mechanical Engineering Design some materials exhibit a downward trend after the maximum stress is reached and frac- ture at point f on the diagram. Others, such as some of the cast irons and high-strength steels, fracture while the stress-strain trace is still rising, as shown in Fig. 2–2 b, where points uand fare identical. As noted in Sec. 1–9, strength, as used in this book, is a built-in property of a mate- rial, or of a mechanical element, because of the selection of a particular material or process or both. The strength of a connecting rod at the critical location in the geome- try and condition of use, for example, is the same no matter whether it is already an ele- ment in an operating machine or whether it is lying on a workbench awaiting assembly with other parts. On the other hand, stress is something that occurs in a part, usually as a result of its being assembled into a machine and loaded. However, stresses may be built into a part by processing or handling. For example, shot peening produces a com- pressive stress in the outer surface of a part, and also improves the fatigue strength of the part. Thus, in this book we will be very careful in distinguishing between strength, designated by S, and stress, designated by σor τ. The diagrams in Fig. 2–2 are called engineering stress-strain diagrams because the stresses and strains calculated in Eqs. (2–1) and (2–2) are not true values. The stress calculated in Eq. (2–1) is based on the original area before the load is applied. In real- ity, as the load is applied the area reduces so that the actual or true stress is larger than the engineering stress . To obtain the true stress for the diagram the load and the cross- sectional area must be measured simultaneously during the test. Figure 2–2 arepresents a ductile material where the stress appears to decrease from points uto f. Typically, beyond point uthe specimen begins to “neck” at a location of weakness where the area reduces dramatically, as shown in Fig. 2–3. For this reason, the true stress is much higher than the engineering stress at the necked section. The engineering strain given by Eq. (2–2) is based on net change in length from the original length. In plotting the true stress-strain diagram, it is customary to use a term called true strain or, sometimes, logarithmic strain. True strain is the sum of the incre- mental elongations divided by the current gauge length at load P, or ε=/integraldisplayl l0dl l=lnl l0(2–4) where the symbol εis used to represent true strain. The most important characteristic of a true stress-strain diagram (Fig. 2–4) is that the true stress continually increases all the way to fracture. Thus, as shown in Fig. 2–4, the true fracture stress σfis greater than the true ultimate stress σu. Contrast this with Fig. 2–2 a, where the engineering fracture strength Sfis less than the engineering ultimate strength Su. Compression tests are more difﬁcult to conduct, and the geometry of the test spec- imens differs from the geometry of those used in tension tests. The reason for this is that the specimen may buckle during testing or it may be difﬁcult to distribute the stresses evenly. Other difﬁculties occur because ductile materials will bulge after yielding. However, the results can be plotted on a stress-strain diagram also, and the same strength deﬁnitions can be applied as used in tensile testing. For most ductile materials the compressive strengths are about the same as the tensile strengths. When substantial differences occur between tensile and compressive strengt hs, however, as is the case with Figure 2–3 Tension specimen after necking.bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:32 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:Materials 35True stress True strain/H9268u/H9268f f u /H9255f /H9255uFigure 2–4 True stress-strain diagram plotted in Cartesian coordinates. the cast irons, the tensile and compressive strengths should be stated separately, Sut, Suc, where Sucis reported as a positive quantity. Torsional strengths are found by twisting solid circular bars and recording the torque and the twist angle. The results are then plotted as a torque-twist diagram. The shear stresses in the specimen are linear with respect to radial location, being zero at the cen- ter of the specimen and maximum at the outer radius r(see Chap. 3). The maximum shear stress τmaxis related to the angle of twist θby τmax=Gr l0θ (2–5) where θis in radians, ris the radius of the specimen, l0is the gauge length, and Gis the material stiffness property called the shear modulus or the modulus of rigidity . The maximum shear stress is also related to the applied torque Tas τmax=Tr J(2–6) where J=1 2πr4is the polar second moment of area of the cross section. The torque-twist diagram will be similar to Fig. 2–2, and, using Eqs. (2–5) and (2–6), the modulus of rigidity can be found as well as the elastic limit and the torsional yield strength Ssy. The maximum point on a torque-twist diagram, corresponding to point u on Fig. 2–2, is Tu. The equation Ssu=Tur J(2–7) deﬁnes the modulus of rupture for the torsion test. Note that it is incorrect to call Ssu the ultimate torsional strength, as the outermost region of the bar is in a plastic state at the torque Tuand the stress distribution is no longer linear. All of the stresses and strengths deﬁned by the stress-strain diagram of Fig. 2–2 and similar diagrams are speciﬁcally known as engineering stresses and strengths or nomi- nal stresses and strengths. These are the values normally used in all engineering design calculations. The adjectives engineering and nominal are used here to emphasize that the stresses are computed by using the original or unstressed cross-sectional area of the specimen. In this book we shall use these modiﬁers only when we speciﬁcally wish to call attention to this distinction.bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:32 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:36 Mechanical Engineering Design In addition to providing strength values for a material, the stress-strain diagram provides insight into the energy-absorbing characteristics of a material. This is because the stress-strain diagram involves both loads and deﬂections, which are directly related to energy. The capacity of a material to absorb energy within its elastic range is called resilience. The modulus of resilience u Rof a material is deﬁned as the energy absorbed per unit volume without permanent deformation, and is equal to the area under the stress- strain curve up to the elastic limit. The elastic limit is often approximated by the yield point, since it is more readily determined, giving uR∼=/integraldisplay/epsilon1y 0σd/epsilon1 (2–8) where /epsilon1yis the strain at the yield point. If the stress-strain is linear to the yield point, then the area under the curve is simply a triangular area; thus uR∼=1 2Sy/epsilon1y=1 2(Sy)(Sy/E)=S2 y 2E(2–9) This relationship indicates that for two materials with the same yield strength, the less stiff material (lower E), will have a greater resilience, that is, an ability to absorb more energy without yielding. The capacity of a material to absorb energy without fracture is called toughness. The modulus of toughness u Tof a material is deﬁned as the energy absorbed per unit volume without fracture, which is equal to the total area under the stress-strain curve up to the fracture point, or uT=/integraldisplay/epsilon1f 0σd/epsilon1 (2–10) where /epsilon1fis the strain at the fracture point. This integration is often performed graphi- cally from the stress-strain data, or a rough approximation can be obtained by using the average of the yield and ultimate strengths and the strain at fracture to calculate an area; that is, uT∼=/parenleftbiggSy+Sut 2/parenrightbigg /epsilon1f (2–11) The units of toughness and resilience are energy per unit volume (lbf /H11080in/in3or J/m3), which are numerically equivalent to psi or Pa. These deﬁnitions of toughness and resilience assume the low strain rates that are suitable for obtaining the stress-strain diagram. For higher strain rates, see Sec. 2–5 for impact properties. 2–2 The Statistical Signiﬁcance of Material Properties There is some subtlety in the ideas presented in the previous section that should be pon- dered carefully before continuing. Figure 2–2 depicts the result of a single tension test (onespecimen, now fractured). It is common for engineers to consider these important stress values (at points pl, el, y,u, and f) as properties and to denote them as strengths with a special notation, uppercase S, in lieu of lowercase sigma σ, with subscripts added: Splfor proportional limit, Syfor yield strength, Sufor ultimate tensile strength (Sutor Suc, if tensile or compressive sense is important). If there were 1000 nominally identical specimens, the values of strength obtained would be distributed between some minimum and maximum values. It follows that thebud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/12/2009 7:59 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Materials 37 description of strength, a material property, is distributional and thus is statistical in nature. Chapter 20 provides more detail on statistical considerations in design. Here we will simply describe the results of one example, Ex. 20–4. Consider the following table, which is a histographic report containing the maximum stresses of 1000 tensile tests on a 1020 steel from a single heat. Here we are seeking the ultimate tensile strength Sut. The class frequency is the number of occurrences within a 1 kpsi range given by the class midpoint. For example, 18 maximum stress values occurred in the range of 57 to 58 kpsi.

The bar chart in Fig. 2–5 depicts the histogram of the probability den- sity. If the data is in the form of a Gaussian ornormal distribution , the probability density function determined in Ex. 20–4 is f(x)=1 2.594√ 2πexp/bracketleftBigg −1 2/parenleftbiggx−63.62 2.594/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg where the mean stress is 63.62 kpsi and the standard deviation is 2.594 kpsi. A plot off(x)is also included in Fig. 2–5. The description of the strength Sutis then expressed in terms of its statistical parameters and its distribution type. In this case Sut=N(63.62, 2.594) kpsi, indicating a normal distribution with a mean stress of 63.62 kpsi and a standard deviation of 2.594 kpsi. Note that the test program has described 1020 property Sut, for only one heat of one supplier. Testing is an involved and expensive process. Tables of properties are often prepared to be helpful to other persons. A statistical quantity is described by itsbud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/12/2009 7:59 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:38 Mechanical Engineering Design mean, standard deviation, and distribution type. Many tables display a single number, which is often the mean, minimum, or some percentile, such as the 99th percentile. Always read the foonotes to the table. If no qualiﬁcation is made in a single-entry table, the table is subject to serious doubt. Since it is no surprise that useful descriptions of a property are statistical in nature, engineers, when ordering property tests, should couch the instructions so the data gen- erated are enough for them to observe the statistical parameters and to identify the dis- tributional characteristic. The tensile test program on 1000 specimens of 1020 steel is a large one. If you were faced with putting something in a table of ultimate tensile strengths and constrained to a single number, what would it be and just how would your footnote read? 2–3 Strength and Cold Work Cold working is the process of plastic straining below the recrystallization temperature in the plastic region of the stress-strain diagram. Materials can be deformed plastically by the application of heat, as in forging or hot rolling, but the resulting mechanical properties are quite different from those obtained by cold working. The purpose of this section is to explain what happens to the signiﬁcant mechanical properties of a material when that material is cold worked. Consider the stress-strain diagram of Fig. 2–6 a. Here a material has been stressed beyond the yield strength at yto some point i, in the plastic region, and then the load removed. At this point the material has a permanent plastic deformation /epsilon1p. If the load corresponding to point iis now reapplied, the material will be elastically deformed by the amount /epsilon1e. Thus at point ithe total unit strain consists of the two components /epsilon1pand /epsilon1eand is given by the equation /epsilon1=/epsilon1p+/epsilon1e (a) This material can be unloaded and reloaded any number of times from and to point i, and it is found that the action always occurs along the straight line that is approximately parallel to the initial elastic line Oy. Thus /epsilon1e=σi E(b) /H9280/H9280e /H9280pUnit strain, /H9280 Nominal stress, /H9268 (a)/H9268iSu iu y OSyf Load, P (b)Area deformation (reduction)PiPuu f yi Py A0 A/H11032i Ai AfFigure 2–6 (a) Stress-strain diagram showing unloading and reloading at point iin the plastic region; ( b) analogous load-deformation diagram.bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:33 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:Materials 39 The material now has a higher yield point, is less ductile as a result of a reduction in strain capacity, and is said to be strain-hardened . If the process is continued, increasing /epsilon1p, the material can become brittle and exhibit sudden fracture. It is possible to construct a similar diagram, as in Fig. 2–6 b, where the abscissa is the area deformation and the ordinate is the applied load. The reduction in area corre- sponding to the load Pf,at fracture, is deﬁned as R=A0−Af A0=1−Af A0(2–12) where A0is the original area. The quantity Rin Eq. (2–12) is usually expressed in per- cent and tabulated in lists of mechanical properties as a measure of ductility . See Appendix Table A–20, for example. Ductility is an important property because it mea- sures the ability of a material to absorb overloads and to be cold-worked. Thus such operations as bending, drawing, heading, and stretch forming are metal-processing operations that require ductile materials. Figure 2–6 bcan also be used to deﬁne the quantity of cold work. The cold-work factor W is deﬁned as W=A0−A/prime i A0≈A0−Ai A0(2–13) where A/prime icorresponds to the area after the load Pihas been released. The approxima- tion in Eq. (2–13) results because of the difﬁculty of measuring the small diametral changes in the elastic region. If the amount of cold work is known, then Eq. (2–13) can be solved for the area A/prime i. The result is A/prime i=A0(1−W) (2–14) Cold working a material produces a new set of values for the strengths, as can be seen from stress-strain diagrams. Datsko3describes the plastic region of the true stress–true strain diagram by the equation σ=σ0εm(2–15) where σ=true stress σ0=a strength coefﬁcient, or strain-strengthening coefﬁcient ε=true plastic strain m=strain-strengthening exponent It can be shown4that m=εu (2–16) provided that the load-deformation curve exhibits a stationary point (a place of zero slope). 3Joseph Datsko, “Solid Materials,” Chap. 32 in Joseph E. Shigley, Charles R. Mischke, and Thomas H. Brown, Jr. (eds.), Standard Handbook of Machine Design, 3rd ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 2004. See also Joseph Datsko, “New Look at Material Strength,” Machine Design, vol. 58, no. 3, Feb. 6, 1986, pp. 81–85. 4See Sec. 5–2, J. E. Shigley and C. R. Mischke, Mechanical Engineering Design, 6th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 2001.bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:33 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:40 Mechanical Engineering Design Difﬁculties arise when using the gauge length to evaluate the true strain in the plastic range, since necking causes the strain to be nonuniform. A more satisfactory relation can be obtained by using the area at the neck. Assuming that the change in vol- ume of the material is small, Al=A0l0. Thus, l/l0=A0/A, and the true strain is given by ε=lnl l0=lnA0 A(2–17) Returning to Fig. 2–6 b, if point iis to the left of point u, that is, Pi<Pu, then the new yield strength is S/prime y=Pi A/prime i=σ0εm i Pi≤Pu (2–18) Because of the reduced area, that is, because A/prime i<A0, the ultimate strength also changes, and is S/prime u=Pu A/prime i(c) Since Pu=SuA0, we ﬁnd, with Eq. (2–14), that S/prime u=SuA0 A0(1−W)=Su 1−Wεi≤εu (2–19) which is valid only when point iis to the left of point u. For points to the right of u, the yield strength is approaching the ultimate strength, and, with small loss in accuracy, S/prime u.=S/prime y.=σ0εm i εi>ε u (2–20) A little thought will reveal that a bar will have the same ultimate load in tension after being strain-strengthened in tension as it had before. The new strength is of interest to us not because the static ultimate load increases, but—since fatigue strengths are correlated with the local ultimate strengths—because the fatigue strength im- proves. Also the yield strength increases, giving a larger range of sustainable elastic loading. EXAMPLE 2–1 An annealed AISI 1018 steel (see Table A–22) has Sy=32.0kpsi, Su=49.5kpsi, σf=91.1kpsi, σ0=90kpsi, m=0.25, and εf=1.05in/in. Find the new values of the strengths if the material is given 15 percent cold work. Solution From Eq. (2–16), we ﬁnd the true strain corresponding to the ultimate strength to be εu=m=0.25 The ratio A0/Aiis, from Eq. (2–13), A0 Ai=1 1−W=1 1−0.15=1.176bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:33 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:The true strain corresponding to 15 percent cold work is obtained from Eq. (2–17). Thus εi=lnA0 Ai=ln 1.176=0.1625 Since εi<ε u, Eqs. (2–18) and (2–19) apply. Therefore, Answer S/prime y=σ0εm i=90(0.1625)0.25=57.1kpsi Answer S/prime u=Su 1−W=49.5 1−0.15=58.2kpsi 2–4 Hardness The resistance of a material to penetration by a pointed tool is called hardness . Though there are many hardness-measuring systems, we shall consider here only the two in greatest use. Rockwell hardness tests are described by ASTM standard hardness method E–18 and measurements are quickly and easily made, they have good reproducibility, and the test machine for them is easy to use. In fact, the hardness number is read directly from a dial. Rockwell hardness scales are designated as A,B,C,..., etc. The inden- ters are described as a diamond, a 1 16-in-diameter ball, and a diamond for scales A, B, and C, respectively, where the load applied is either 60, 100, or 150 kg. Thus the Rockwell Bscale, designated RB, uses a 100-kg load and a No. 2 indenter, which is a 1 16-in-diameter ball. The Rockwell Cscale RCuses a diamond cone, which is the No. 1 indenter, and a load of 150 kg. Hardness numbers so obtained are relative. Therefore a hardness RC=50has meaning only in relation to another hardness num- ber using the same scale. The Brinell hardness is another test in very general use. In testing, the indenting tool through which force is applied is a ball and the hardness number HBis found as a number equal to the applied load divided by the spherical surface area of the inden- tation. Thus the units of HBare the same as those of stress, though they are seldom used. Brinell hardness testing takes more time, since HBmust be computed from the test data. The primary advantage of both methods is that they are nondestructive in most cases. Both are empirically and directly related to the ultimate strength of the material tested. This means that the strength of parts could, if desired, be tested part by part during manufacture. Hardness testing provides a convenient and nondestructive means of estimating the strength properties of materials. The Brinell hardness test is particularly well known for this estimation, since for many materials the relationship between the minimum ultimate strength and the Brinell hardness number is roughly linear. The constant of proportionality varies between classes of materials, and is also dependent on the load used to determine the hardness. There is a wide scatter in the data, but for rough approx- imations for steels, the relationship is generally accepted as Su=/braceleftbigg0.5HB kpsi 3.4HB MPa(2–21)Materials 41bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:33 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:42 Mechanical Engineering Design 5D.

What hardness should be speciﬁed? Solution From Eq. (2–22), with ( Su)min=20 kpsi, we have Answer HB=Su+12.5 0.23=20+12.5 0.23=141 If the foundry can control the hardness within 20 points, routinely, then specify 145<HB<165. This imposes no hardship on the foundry and assures the designer that ASTM grade 20 will always be supplied at a predictable cost. 2–5 Impact Properties An external force applied to a structure or part is called an impact load if the time of application is less than one-third the lowest natural period of vibration of the part or structure. Otherwise it is called simply a static load . TheCharpy (commonly used) and Izod (rarely used) notched-bar tests utilize bars of speciﬁed geometries to determine brittleness and impact strength. These tests are helpful in comparing several materials and in the determination of low-temperature brittleness. In both tests the specimen is struck by a pendulum released from a ﬁxed height, and the energy absorbed by the specimen, called the impact value, can be computed from the height of swing after fracture, but is read from a dial that essentially “computes” the result. The effect of temperature on impact values is shown in Fig. 2–7 for a material showing a ductile-brittle transition. Not all materials show this transition. Notice the narrow region of critical temperatures where the impact value increases very rapidly. In the low-temperature region the fracture appears as a brittle, shattering type, whereas the appearance is a tough, tearing type above the critical-temperature region. The critical temperature seems to be dependent on both the material and the geometry of the notch. For this reason designers should not rely too heavily on the results of notched-bar tests. The average strain rate used in obtaining the stress-strain diagram is about 0.001 in/(in ·s) or less. When the strain rate is increased, as it is under impact conditions,bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:33 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:Materials 43 –400 0 200 4000204060Charpy, ft /H11554lbf Temperature, °F–200Figure 2–7 A mean trace shows the effect of temperature on impact values. The result of interest is the brittle-ductile transition temperature, often deﬁned as the temperature at which the mean trace passes through the 15 ft·lbf level. The critical temperature isdependent on the geometry of the notch, which is why the Charpy V notch is closely deﬁned. 10–610–410–211 02104020406080100 020406080100Strength, kpsi Strain rate, s–1 Ratio, Sy/Su, % Elongation, %Ratio, Sy/Su Ultimate strength, Su Total elongation Yield strength, SyFigure 2–8 Inﬂuence of strain rate on tensile properties. the strengths increase, as shown in Fig. 2–8. In fact, at very high strain rates the yield strength seems to approach the ultimate strength as a limit. But note that the curves show little change in the elongation. This means that the ductility remains about the same. Also, in view of the sharp increase in yield strength, a mild steel could be expected to behave elastically throughout practically its entire strength range under impact conditions. The Charpy and Izod tests really provide toughness data under dynamic, rather than static, conditions. It may well be that impact data obtained from these tests are as depen- dent on the notch geometry as they are on the strain rate. For these reasons it may be bet- ter to use the concepts of notch sensitivity, fracture toughness, and fracture mechanics, discussed in Chaps. 5 and 6, to assess the possibility of cracking or fracture. 2–6 Temperature Effects Strength and ductility, or brittleness, are properties affected by the temperature of the operating environment. The effect of temperature on the static properties of steels is typiﬁed by the strength versus temperature chart of Fig. 2–9. Note that the tensile strength changesbud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:33 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:44 Mechanical Engineering Design 1st stage 2nd stage 3rd stage TimeCreep deformationFigure 2–10 Creep-time curve.only a small amount until a certain temperature is reached. At that point it falls off rapidly. The yield strength, however, decreases continuously as the environmental tem- perature is increased. There is a substantial increase in ductility, as might be expected, at the higher temperatures. Many tests have been made of ferrous metals subjected to constant loads for long periods of time at elevated temperatures. The specimens were found to be permanently deformed during the tests, even though at times the actual stresses were less than the yield strength of the material obtained from short-time tests made at the same temper- ature. This continuous deformation under load is called creep . One of the most useful tests to have been devised is the long-time creep test under constant load. Figure 2–10 illustrates a curve that is typical of this kind of test. The curve is obtained at a constant stated temperature. A number of tests are usually run simultaneously at different stress intensities. The curve exhibits three distinct regions. In the ﬁrst stage are included both the elastic and the plastic deformation. This stage shows a decreasing creep rate, which is due to the strain hardening. The second stage shows a constant minimum creep rate caused by the annealing effect. In the third stage the specimen shows a considerable reduction in area, the true stress is increased, and a higher creep eventually leads to fracture. When the operating temperatures are lower than the transition temperature (Fig. 2–7), the possibility arises that a part could fail by a brittle fracture. This subject will be discussed in Chap. 5. Of course, heat treatment, as will be shown, is used to make substantial changes in the mechanical properties of a material.1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.50 200 400 600ST/SRTSy RT Temperature, °CSutFigure 2–9 A plot of the results of 145 tests of 21 carbon and alloy steels showing the effect of operating temperature on the yield strength Syand the ultimate strength Sut.

Be sure to review these.Heating due to electric and gas welding also changes the mechanical properties. Such changes may be due to clamping during the welding process, as well as heating; the resulting stresses then remain when the parts have cooled and the clamps have been removed. Hardness tests can be used to learn whether the strength has been changed by welding, but such tests will not reveal the presence of residual stresses. 2–7 Numbering Systems The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) was the ﬁrst to recognize the need, and to adopt a system, for the numbering of steels. Later the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) adopted a similar system. In 1975 the SAE published the Uniﬁed Numbering System for Metals and Alloys (UNS); this system also contains cross-reference num- bers for other material speciﬁcations.7The UNS uses a letter preﬁx to designate the material, as, for example, G for the carbon and alloy steels, A for the aluminum alloys, C for the copper-base alloys, and S for the stainless or corrosion-resistant steels. For some materials, not enough agreement has as yet developed in the industry to warrant the establishment of a designation. For the steels, the ﬁrst two numbers following the letter preﬁx indicate the compo- sition, excluding the carbon content. The various compositions used are as follows: G10 Plain carbon G11 Free-cutting carbon steel with more sulfur or phosphorus G13 Manganese G23 Nickel G25 Nickel G31 Nickel-chromium G33 Nickel-chromium G40 Molybdenum G41 Chromium-molybdenum G43 Nickel-chromium-molybdenum The second number pair refers to the approximate carbon content. Thus, G10400 is a plain carbon steel with a nominal carbon content of 0.40 percent (0.37 to 0.44 percent). The ﬁfth number following the preﬁx is used for special situations. For example, the old designation AISI 52100 represents a chromium alloy with about 100 points of carbon. The UNS designation is G52986. The UNS designations for the stainless steels, preﬁx S, utilize the older AISI des- ignations for the ﬁrst three numbers following the preﬁx. The next two numbers are reserved for special purposes. The ﬁrst number of the group indicates the approximate composition. Thus 2 is a chromium-nickel-manganese steel, 3 is a chromium-nickel steel, and 4 is a chromium alloy steel. Sometimes stainless steels are referred to by their alloy content. Thus S30200 is often called an 18-8 stainless steel, meaning 18 percent chromium and 8 percent nickel.G46 Nickel-molybdenum G48 Nickel-molybdenum G50 Chromium G51 Chromium G52 Chromium G61 Chromium-vanadium G86 Chromium-nickel-molybdenum G87 Chromium-nickel-molybdenum G92 Manganese-silicon G94 Nickel-chromium-molybdenumbud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:34 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:46 Mechanical Engineering Design The prefix for the aluminum group is the letter A. The first number following the prefix indicates the processing. For example, A9 is a wrought aluminum, while A0 is a casting alloy. The second number designates the main alloy group as shown in Table 2–1. The third number in the group is used to modify the original alloy or to designate the impurity limits. The last two numbers refer to other alloys used with the basic group. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) numbering system for cast iron is in widespread use. This system is based on the tensile strength. Thus ASTM A18 speaks of classes; e.g., 30 cast iron has a minimum tensile strength of 30 kpsi. Note from Appendix A-24, however, that the typical tensile strength is 31 kpsi. You should be careful to designate which of the two values is used in design and problem work because of the signiﬁcance of factor of safety. 2–8 Sand Casting Sand casting is a basic low-cost process, and it lends itself to economical production in large quantities with practically no limit to the size, shape, or complexity of the part produced. In sand casting, the casting is made by pouring molten metal into sand molds. A pattern, constructed of metal or wood, is used to form the cavity into which the molten metal is poured. Recesses or holes in the casting are produced by sand cores introduced into the mold. The designer should make an effort to visualize the pattern and casting in the mold. In this way the problems of core setting, pattern removal, draft, and solid- iﬁcation can be studied. Castings to be used as test bars of cast iron are cast separately and properties may vary. Steel castings are the most difﬁcult of all to produce, because steel has the highest melting temperature of all materials normally used for casting. This high temperature aggravates all casting problems. The following rules will be found quite useful in the design of any sand casting: 1All sections should be designed with a uniform thickness. 2The casting should be designed so as to produce a gradual change from section to section where this is necessary. 3Adjoining sections should be designed with generous ﬁllets or radii. 4A complicated part should be designed as two or more simple castings to be assembled by fasteners or by welding. Steel, gray iron, brass, bronze, and aluminum are most often used in castings. The minimum wall thickness for any of these materials is about 5 mm, though with partic- ular care, thinner sections can be obtained with some materials.Table 2–1 Aluminum Alloy DesignationsAluminum 99.00% pure and greater Ax1xxx Copper alloys Ax2xxx Manganese alloys Ax3xxx Silicon alloys Ax4xxx Magnesium alloys Ax5xxx Magnesium-silicon alloys Ax6xxx Zinc alloys Ax7xxx bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:34 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:Materials 47 2–9 Shell Molding The shell-molding process employs a heated metal pattern, usually made of cast iron, aluminum, or brass, which is placed in a shell-molding machine containing a mixture of dry sand and thermosetting resin. The hot pattern melts the plastic, which, together with the sand, forms a shell about 5 to 10 mm thick around the pattern. The shell is then baked at from 400 to 700°F for a short time while still on the pattern. It is then stripped from the pattern and placed in storage for use in casting. In the next step the shells are assembled by clamping, bolting, or pasting; they are placed in a backup material, such as steel shot; and the molten metal is poured into the cavity. The thin shell permits the heat to be conducted away so that solidiﬁcation takes place rapidly. As solidiﬁcation takes place, the plastic bond is burned and the mold col- lapses. The permeability of the backup material allows the gases to escape and the cast- ing to air-cool. All this aids in obtaining a ﬁne-grain, stress-free casting. Shell-mold castings feature a smooth surface, a draft that is quite small, and close tolerances. In general, the rules governing sand casting also apply to shell-mold casting. 2–10 Investment Casting Investment casting uses a pattern that may be made from wax, plastic, or other material. After the mold is made, the pattern is melted out. Thus a mechanized method of casting a great many patterns is necessary. The mold material is dependent upon the melting point of the cast metal. Thus a plaster mold can be used for some materials while others would require a ceramic mold. After the pattern is melted out, the mold is baked or ﬁred; when ﬁring is completed, the molten metal may be poured into the hot mold and allowed to cool. If a number of castings are to be made, then metal or permanent molds may be suit- able. Such molds have the advantage that the surfaces are smooth, bright, and accurate, so that little, if any, machining is required. Metal-mold castings are also known as die castings and centrifugal castings . 2–11 Powder-Metallurgy Process The powder-metallurgy process is a quantity-production process that uses powders from a single metal, several metals, or a mixture of metals and nonmetals. It consists essen- tially of mechanically mixing the powders, compacting them in dies at high pressures, and heating the compacted part at a temperature less than the melting point of the major ingredient. The particles are united into a single strong part similar to what would be obtained by melting the same ingredients together. The advantages are (1) the elimina- tion of scrap or waste material, (2) the elimination of machining operations, (3) the low unit cost when mass-produced, and (4) the exact control of composition. Some of the dis- advantages are (1) the high cost of dies, (2) the lower physical properties, (3) the higher cost of materials, (4) the limitations on the design, and (5) the limited range of materials that can be used. Parts commonly made by this process are oil-impregnated bearings, incandescent lamp ﬁlaments, cemented-carbide tips for tools, and permanent magnets. Some products can be made only by powder metallurgy: surgical implants, for example. The structure is different from what can be obtained by melting the same ingredients. 2–12 Hot-Working Processes By hot working are meant such processes as rolling, forging, hot extrusion, and hot pressing, in which the metal is heated above its recrystallation temperature.bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:34 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:48 Mechanical Engineering Design Hot rolling is usually used to create a bar of material of a particular shape and dimension. Figure 2–11 shows some of the various shapes that are commonly produced by the hot-rolling process. All of them are available in many different sizes as well as in different materials. The materials most available in the hot-rolled bar sizes are steel, aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. Tubing can be manufactured by hot-rolling strip or plate. The edges of the strip are rolled together, creating seams that are either butt-welded or lap-welded. Seamless tub- ing is manufactured by roll-piercing a solid heated rod with a piercing mandrel. Extrusion is the process by which great pressure is applied to a heated metal billet or blank, causing it to ﬂow through a restricted oriﬁce. This process is more common with materials of low melting point, such as aluminum, copper, magnesium, lead, tin, and zinc. Stainless steel extrusions are available on a more limited basis. Forging is the hot working of metal by hammers, presses, or forging machines. In common with other hot-working processes, forging produces a reﬁned grain structure that results in increased strength and ductility. Compared with castings, forgings have greater strength for the same weight. In addition, drop forgings can be made smoother and more accurate than sand castings, so that less machining is necessary. However, the initial cost of the forging dies is usually greater than the cost of patterns for castings, although the greater unit strength rather than the cost is usually the deciding factor between these two processes. 2–13 Cold-Working Processes By cold working is meant the forming of the metal while at a low temperature (usually room temperature). In contrast to parts produced by hot working, cold-worked parts have a bright new ﬁnish, are more accurate, and require less machining. Cold-ﬁnished bars and shafts are produced by rolling, drawing, turning, grinding, and polishing. Of these methods, by far the largest percentage of products are made by the cold-rolling and cold-drawing processes. Cold rolling is now used mostly for the production of wide ﬂats and sheets. Practically all cold-ﬁnished bars are made by cold drawing but even so are sometimes mistakenly called “cold-rolled bars.” In the drawing process, the hot-rolled bars are ﬁrst cleaned of scale and then drawn by pulling them through a die that reduces the size about 1 32to 1 16in. This process does not remove material from the bar but reduces, or “draws” down, the size. Many different shapes of hot-rolled bars may be used for cold drawing. Cold rolling and cold drawing have the same effect upon the mechanical proper- ties. The cold-working process does not change the grain size but merely distorts it. Cold working results in a large increase in yield strength, an increase in ultimateRound Square Half oval (a) Bar shapesFlat Hexagon (b) Structural shapesWide flange Channel Angle Tee ZeeFigure 2–11 Common shapes available through hot rolling.bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:34 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:Materials 49 0 0.2 0.4 0.6020406080100 Elongation, inStrength, kpsiYield point Yield pointCold-drawn Hot-rolledFigure 2–12 Stress-strain diagram for hot-rolled and cold-drawn UNS G10350 steel. strength and hardness, and a decrease in ductility. In Fig. 2–12 the properties of a cold- drawn bar are compared with those of a hot-rolled bar of the same material. Heading is a cold-working process in which the metal is gathered, or upset. This operation is commonly used to make screw and rivet heads and is capable of producing a wide variety of shapes. Roll threading is the process of rolling threads by squeezing and rolling a blank between two serrated dies. Spinning is the operation of working sheet mate- rial around a rotating form into a circular shape. Stamping is the term used to describe punch-press operations such as blanking, coining, forming, andshallow drawing . 2–14 The Heat Treatment of Steel Heat treatment of steel refers to time- and temperature-controlled processes that relieve residual stresses and/or modiﬁes material properties such as hardness (strength), duc- tility, and toughness. Other mechanical or chemical operations are sometimes grouped under the heading of heat treatment. The common heat-treating operations are anneal- ing, quenching, tempering, and case hardening. Annealing When a material is cold- or hot-worked, residual stresses are built in, and, in addition, the material usually has a higher hardness as a result of these working operations. These oper- ations change the structure of the material so that it is no longer represented by the equi- librium diagram. Full annealing and normalizing is a heating operation that permits the material to transform according to the equilibrium diagram. The material to be annealed is heated to a temperature that is approximately 100°F above the critical temperature. It is held at this temperature for a time that is sufﬁcient for the carbon to become dissolved and diffused through the material. The object being treated is then allowed to cool slowly, usu- ally in the furnace in which it was treated. If the transformation is complete, then it is said to have a full anneal. Annealing is used to soften a material and make it more ductile, to relieve residual stresses, and to reﬁne the grain structure. The term annealing includes the process called normalizing . Parts to be normalized may be heated to a slightly higher temperature than in full annealing. This produces a coarser grain structure, which is more easily machined if the material is a low-carbon steel. In the normalizing process the part is cooled in still air at room temperature. Since this cooling is more rapid than the slow cooling used in full annealing, less time is available for equilibrium, and the material is harder than fully annealed steel. Normalizing is often used as the ﬁnal treating operation for steel. The cooling in still air amounts to a slow quench.bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:34 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:50 Mechanical Engineering Design Quenching Eutectoid steel that is fully annealed consists entirely of pearlite, which is obtained from austenite under conditions of equilibrium. A fully annealed hypoeutectoid steel would consist of pearlite plus ferrite, while hypereutectoid steel in the fully annealed condition would consist of pearlite plus cementite. The hardness of steel of a given carbon content depends upon the structure that replaces the pearlite when full anneal- ing is not carried out. The absence of full annealing indicates a more rapid rate of cooling. The rate of cooling is the factor that determines the hardness. A controlled cooling rate is called quenching . A mild quench is obtained by cooling in still air, which, as we have seen, is obtained by the normalizing process. The two most widely used media for quenching are water and oil. The oil quench is quite slow but prevents quenching cracks caused by rapid expansion of the object being treated. Quenching in water is used for carbon steels and for medium-carbon, low-alloy steels. The effectiveness of quenching depends upon the fact that when austenite is cooled it does not transform into pearlite instantaneously but requires time to initiate and com- plete the process. Since the transformation ceases at about 800°F, it can be prevented by rapidly cooling the material to a lower temperature. When the material is cooled rapidly to 400°F or less, the austenite is transformed into a structure called martensite . Martensite is a supersaturated solid solution of carbon in ferrite and is the hardest and strongest form of steel. If steel is rapidly cooled to a temperature between 400 and 800°F and held there for a sufﬁcient length of time, the austenite is transformed into a material that is gener- ally called bainite . Bainite is a structure intermediate between pearlite and martensite. Although there are several structures that can be identiﬁed between the temperatures given, depending upon the temperature used, they are collectively known as bainite. By the choice of this transformation temperature, almost any variation of structure may be obtained. These range all the way from coarse pearlite to ﬁne martensite. Tempering When a steel specimen has been fully hardened, it is very hard and brittle and has high residual stresses. The steel is unstable and tends to contract on aging. This tendency is increased when the specimen is subjected to externally applied loads, because the resultant stresses contribute still more to the instability. These internal stresses can be relieved by a modest heating process called stress relieving, or a combination of stress relieving and softening called tempering or drawing . After the specimen has been fully hardened by being quenched from above the critical temperature, it is reheated to some temperature below the critical temperature for a certain period of time and then allowed to cool in still air. The temperature to which it is reheated depends upon the composition and the degree of hardness or toughness desired.8This reheating operation releases the carbon held in the martensite, forming carbide crystals. The structure obtained is called tempered martensite . It is now essentially a superﬁne dispersion of iron carbide(s) in ﬁne-grained ferrite. The effect of heat-treating operations upon the various mechanical properties of a low alloy steel is shown graphically in Fig. 2–13. 8For the quantitative aspects of tempering in plain carbon and low-alloy steels, see Charles R. Mischke, “The Strength of Cold-Worked and Heat-Treated Steels,” Chap. 33 in Joseph E. Shigley, Charles R. Mischke, and Thomas H.

Shigley, Charles R. Mischke, and Thomas H. Brown, Jr. (eds.), Standard Handbook of Machine Design, 3rd ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 2004, p. 33.9.Case Hardening The purpose of case hardening is to produce a hard outer surface on a specimen of low- carbon steel while at the same time retaining the ductility and toughness in the core. This is done by increasing the carbon content at the surface. Either solid, liquid, or gaseous carburizing materials may be used. The process consists of introducing the part to be carburized into the carburizing material for a stated time and at a stated tempera- ture, depending upon the depth of case desired and the composition of the part. The part may then be quenched directly from the carburization temperature and tempered, or in some cases it must undergo a double heat treatment in order to ensure that both the core and the case are in proper condition. Some of the more useful case-hardening processes are pack carburizing, gas carburizing, nitriding, cyaniding, induction hardening, and ﬂame hardening. In the last two cases carbon is not added to the steel in question, gen- erally a medium carbon steel, for example SAE/AISI 1144. Quantitative Estimation of Properties of Heat-Treated Steels Courses in metallurgy (or material science) for mechanical engineers usually present the addition method of Crafts and Lamont for the prediction of heat-treated properties from the Jominy test for plain carbon steels.9If this has not been in your prerequisite experience, then refer to the Standard Handbook of Machine Design, where the addi- tion method is covered with examples.10If this book is a textbook for a machinebud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:34 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:52 Mechanical Engineering Design elements course, it is a good class project (many hands make light work) to study the method and report to the class. For low-alloy steels, the multiplication method of Grossman11and Field12is explained in the Standard Handbook of Machine Design (Secs. 29.6 and 33.6). Modern Steels and Their Properties Handbook explains how to predict the Jominy curve by the method of Grossman and Field from a ladle analysis and grain size.13 Bethlehem Steel has developed a circular plastic slide rule that is convenient to the purpose. 2–15 Alloy Steels Although a plain carbon steel is an alloy of iron and carbon with small amounts of manganese, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus, the term alloy steel is applied when one or more elements other than carbon are introduced in sufﬁcient quantities to modify its properties substantially. The alloy steels not only possess more desirable physical properties but also permit a greater latitude in the heat-treating process. Chromium The addition of chromium results in the formation of various carbides of chromium that are very hard, yet the resulting steel is more ductile than a steel of the same hardness pro- duced by a simple increase in carbon content. Chromium also reﬁnes the grain structure so that these two combined effects result in both increased toughness and increased hard- ness. The addition of chromium increases the critical range of temperatures and moves the eutectoid point to the left. Chromium is thus a very useful alloying element. Nickel The addition of nickel to steel also causes the eutectoid point to move to the left and increases the critical range of temperatures. Nickel is soluble in ferrite and does not form carbides or oxides. This increases the strength without decreasing the ductility. Case hardening of nickel steels results in a better core than can be obtained with plain carbon steels. Chromium is frequently used in combination with nickel to obtain the toughness and ductility provided by the nickel and the wear resistance and hardness contributed by the chromium. Manganese Manganese is added to all steels as a deoxidizing and desulfurizing agent, but if the sul- fur content is low and the manganese content is over 1 percent, the steel is classiﬁed as a manganese alloy. Manganese dissolves in the ferrite and also forms carbides. It causes the eutectoid point to move to the left and lowers the critical range of temperatures. It increases the time required for transformation so that oil quenching becomes practicable. Silicon Silicon is added to all steels as a deoxidizing agent. When added to very-low-carbon steels, it produces a brittle material with a low hysteresis loss and a high magnetic permeability. The principal use of silicon is with other alloying elements, such as manganese, chromium, and vanadium, to stabilize the carbides. 11M. A. Grossman, AIME, February 1942. 12J.

Molybdenum forms carbides and also dissolves in ferrite to some extent, so that it adds both hardness and toughness. Molybdenum increases the critical range of temperatures and substantially lowers the transformation point. Because of this lowering of the transformation point, molybdenum is most effective in producing desirable oil-hardening and air-hardening properties. Except for carbon, it has the greatest hardening effect, and because it also contributes to a ﬁne grain size, this results in the retention of a great deal of toughness. Vanadium Vanadium has a very strong tendency to form carbides; hence it is used only in small amounts. It is a strong deoxidizing agent and promotes a ﬁne grain size. Since some vana- dium is dissolved in the ferrite, it also toughens the steel. Vanadium gives a wide harden- ing range to steel, and the alloy can be hardened from a higher temperature. It is very difﬁcult to soften vanadium steel by tempering; hence, it is widely used in tool steels. Tungsten Tungsten is widely used in tool steels because the tool will maintain its hardness even at red heat. Tungsten produces a ﬁne, dense structure and adds both toughness and hard- ness. Its effect is similar to that of molybdenum, except that it must be added in greater quantities. 2–16 Corrosion-Resistant Steels Iron-base alloys containing at least 12 percent chromium are called stainless steels . The most important characteristic of these steels is their resistance to many, but not all, corrosive conditions. The four types available are the ferritic chromium steels, the austenitic chromium-nickel steels, and the martensitic and precipitation-hardenable stainless steels. The ferritic chromium steels have a chromium content ranging from 12 to 27 per- cent. Their corrosion resistance is a function of the chromium content, so that alloys containing less than 12 percent still exhibit some corrosion resistance, although they may rust. The quench-hardenability of these steels is a function of both the chromium and the carbon content. The very high carbon steels have good quench hardenability up to about 18 percent chromium, while in the lower carbon ranges it ceases at about 13 percent. If a little nickel is added, these steels retain some degree of hardenability up to 20 percent chromium. If the chromium content exceeds 18 percent, they become dif- ﬁcult to weld, and at the very high chromium levels the hardness becomes so great that very careful attention must be paid to the service conditions. Since chromium is expen- sive, the designer will choose the lowest chromium content consistent with the corro- sive conditions. The chromium-nickel stainless steels retain the austenitic structure at room tem- perature; hence, they are not amenable to heat treatment. The strength of these steels can be greatly improved by cold working. They are not magnetic unless cold-worked. Their work hardenability properties also cause them to be difﬁcult to machine. All the chromium-nickel steels may be welded. They have greater corrosion-resistant prop- erties than the plain chromium steels. When more chromium is added for greater cor- rosion resistance, more nickel must also be added if the austenitic properties are to be retained.bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:34 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:54 Mechanical Engineering Design 2–17 Casting Materials Gray Cast Iron Of all the cast materials, gray cast iron is the most widely used. This is because it has a very low cost, is easily cast in large quantities, and is easy to machine. The principal objections to the use of gray cast iron are that it is brittle and that it is weak in tension. In addition to a high carbon content (over 1.7 percent and usually greater than 2 percent), cast iron also has a high silicon content, with low percentages of sulfur, manganese, and phosphorus. The resultant alloy is composed of pearlite, ferrite, and graphite, and under certain conditions the pearlite may decompose into graphite and ferrite. The resulting product then contains all ferrite and graphite. The graphite, in the form of thin ﬂakes distributed evenly throughout the structure, darkens it; hence, the name gray cast iron . Gray cast iron is not readily welded, because it may crack, but this tendency may be reduced if the part is carefully preheated. Although the castings are generally used in the as-cast condition, a mild anneal reduces cooling stresses and improves the machin- ability. The tensile strength of gray cast iron varies from 100 to 400 MPa (15 to 60 kpsi), and the compressive strengths are 3 to 4 times the tensile strengths. The modulus of elasticity varies widely, with values extending all the way from 75 to 150 GPa (11 to 22 Mpsi). Ductile and Nodular Cast Iron Because of the lengthy heat treatment required to produce malleable cast iron, engineers have long desired a cast iron that would combine the ductile properties of malleable iron with the ease of casting and machining of gray iron and at the same time would possess these properties in the as-cast conditions. A process for producing such a material using magnesium-containing material seems to fulﬁll these requirements. Ductile cast iron, or nodular cast iron, as it is sometimes called, is essentially the same as malleable cast iron, because both contain graphite in the form of spheroids. However, ductile cast iron in the as-cast condition exhibits properties very close to those of malleable iron, and if a simple 1-h anneal is given and is followed by a slow cool, it exhibits even more ductility than the malleable product. Ductile iron is made by adding MgFeSi to the melt; since magnesium boils at this temperature, it is necessary to alloy it with other elements before it is introduced. Ductile iron has a high modulus of elasticity (172 GPa or 25 Mpsi) as compared with gray cast iron, and it is elastic in the sense that a portion of the stress-strain curve is a straight line. Gray cast iron, on the other hand, does not obey Hooke’s law, because the modulus of elasticity steadily decreases with increase in stress. Like gray cast iron, however, nodular iron has a compressive strength that is higher than the tensile strength, although the difference is not as great. In 40 years it has become extensively used. White Cast Iron If all the carbon in cast iron is in the form of cementite and pearlite, with no graphite present, the resulting structure is white and is known as white cast iron . This may be produced in two ways. The composition may be adjusted by keeping the carbon and silicon content low, or the gray-cast-iron composition may be cast against chills in order to promote rapid cooling. By either method, a casting with large amounts of cementite is produced, and as a result the product is very brittle and hard to machine but also very resistant to wear. A chill is usually used in the production of gray-iron castings in orderbud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:34 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:Materials 55 to provide a very hard surface within a particular area of the casting, while at the same time retaining the more desirable gray structure within the remaining portion. This pro- duces a relatively tough casting with a wear-resistant area. Malleable Cast Iron If white cast iron within a certain composition range is annealed, a product called malleable cast iron is formed. The annealing process frees the carbon so that it is pres- ent as graphite, just as in gray cast iron but in a different form. In gray cast iron the graphite is present in a thin ﬂake form, while in malleable cast iron it has a nodular form and is known as temper carbon . A good grade of malleable cast iron may have a tensile strength of over 350 MPa (50 kpsi), with an elongation of as much as 18 per- cent. The percentage elongation of a gray cast iron, on the other hand, is seldom over 1 percent. Because of the time required for annealing (up to 6 days for large and heavy castings), malleable iron is necessarily somewhat more expensive than gray cast iron. Alloy Cast Irons Nickel, chromium, and molybdenum are the most common alloying elements used in cast iron. Nickel is a general-purpose alloying element, usually added in amounts up to 5 percent. Nickel increases the strength and density, improves the wearing qualities, and raises the machinability. If the nickel content is raised to 10 to 18 percent, an austenitic structure with valuable heat- and corrosion-resistant properties results. Chromium increases the hardness and wear resistance and, when used with a chill, increases the tendency to form white iron. When chromium and nickel are both added, the hardness and strength are improved without a reduction in the machinability rating. Molybdenum added in quantities up to 1.25 percent increases the stiffness, hardness, tensile strength, and impact resistance. It is a widely used alloying element. Cast Steels The advantage of the casting process is that parts having complex shapes can be man- ufactured at costs less than fabrication by other means, such as welding. Thus the choice of steel castings is logical when the part is complex and when it must also have a high strength. The higher melting temperatures for steels do aggravate the casting problems and require closer attention to such details as core design, section thicknesses, fillets, and the progress of cooling. The same alloying elements used for the wrought steels can be used for cast steels to improve the strength and other mechanical proper- ties. Cast-steel parts can also be heat-treated to alter the mechanical properties, and, unlike the cast irons, they can be welded. 2–18 Nonferrous Metals Aluminum The outstanding characteristics of aluminum and its alloys are their strength-weight ratio, their resistance to corrosion, and their high thermal and electrical conductivity. The density of aluminum is about 2770 kg/m3(0.10 lbf/in3), compared with 7750 kg/m3 (0.28 lbf/in3) for steel. Pure aluminum has a tensile strength of about 90 MPa (13 kpsi), but this can be improved considerably by cold working and also by alloying with other materials. The modulus of elasticity of aluminum, as well as of its alloys, is 71.7 GPa (10.4 Mpsi), which means that it has about one-third the stiffness of steel.bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:34 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:56 Mechanical Engineering Design Considering the cost and strength of aluminum and its alloys, they are among the most versatile materials from the standpoint of fabrication. Aluminum can be processed by sand casting, die casting, hot or cold working, or extruding. Its alloys can be machined, press-worked, soldered, brazed, or welded. Pure aluminum melts at 660°C (1215°F), which makes it very desirable for the production of either permanent or sand-mold castings. It is commercially available in the form of plate, bar, sheet, foil, rod, and tube and in structural and extruded shapes. Certain precautions must be taken in joining aluminum by soldering, brazing, or welding; these joining methods are not recommended for all alloys. The corrosion resistance of the aluminum alloys depends upon the formation of a thin oxide coating. This ﬁlm forms spontaneously because aluminum is inherently very reactive. Constant erosion or abrasion removes this ﬁlm and allows corrosion to take place. An extra-heavy oxide ﬁlm may be produced by the process called anodizing . In this process the specimen is made to become the anode in an electrolyte, which may be chromic acid, oxalic acid, or sulfuric acid. It is possible in this process to control the color of the resulting ﬁlm very accurately. The most useful alloying elements for aluminum are copper, silicon, manganese, magnesium, and zinc. Aluminum alloys are classiﬁed as casting alloys orwrought alloys . The casting alloys have greater percentages of alloying elements to facilitate casting, but this makes cold working difﬁcult. Many of the casting alloys, and some of the wrought alloys, cannot be hardened by heat treatment. The alloys that are heat- treatable use an alloying element that dissolves in the aluminum. The heat treatment consists of heating the specimen to a temperature that permits the alloying element to pass into solution, then quenching so rapidly that the alloying element is not precipi- tated. The aging process may be accelerated by heating slightly, which results in even greater hardness and strength. One of the better-known heat-treatable alloys is duralu- minum, or 2017 (4 percent Cu, 0.5 percent Mg, 0.5 percent Mn). This alloy hardens in 4 days at room temperature. Because of this rapid aging, the alloy must be stored under refrigeration after quenching and before forming, or it must be formed immediately after quenching. Other alloys (such as 5053) have been developed that age-harden much more slowly, so that only mild refrigeration is required before forming. After forming, they are artiﬁcially aged in a furnace and possess approximately the same strength and hardness as the 2024 alloys. Those alloys of aluminum that cannot be heat-treated can be hardened only by cold working. Both work hardening and the hardening produced by heat treatment may be removed by an annealing process. Magnesium The density of magnesium is about 1800 kg/m3(0.065 lb/in3), which is two-thirds that of aluminum and one-fourth that of steel. Since it is the lightest of all commercial met- als, its greatest use is in the aircraft and automotive industries, but other uses are now being found for it. Although the magnesium alloys do not have great strength, because of their light weight the strength-weight ratio compares favorably with the stronger aluminum and steel alloys. Even so, magnesium alloys ﬁnd their greatest use in appli- cations where strength is not an important consideration. Magnesium will not withstand elevated temperatures; the yield point is deﬁnitely reduced when the temperature is raised to that of boiling water. Magnesium and its alloys have a modulus of elasticity of 45 GPa (6.5 Mpsi) in ten- sion and in compression, although some alloys are not as strong in compression as in tension. Curiously enough, cold working reduces the modulus of elasticity. A range of cast magnesium alloys are also available.bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:34 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:Materials 57 Titanium Titanium and its alloys are similar in strength to moderate-strength steel but weigh half as much as steel. The material exhibits very good resistence to corrosion, has low ther- mal conductivity, is nonmagnetic, and has high-temperature strength. Its modulus of elasticity is between those of steel and aluminum at 16.5 Mpsi (114 GPa). Because of its many advantages over steel and aluminum, applications include: aerospace and mil- itary aircraft structures and components, marine hardware, chemical tanks and process- ing equipment, ﬂuid handling systems, and human internal replacement devices. The disadvantages of titanium are its high cost compared to steel and aluminum and the dif- ﬁculty of machining it. Copper-Base Alloys When copper is alloyed with zinc, it is usually called brass . If it is alloyed with another element, it is often called bronze . Sometimes the other element is speciﬁed too, as, for ex- ample, tin bronze or phosphor bronze . There are hundreds of variations in each category. Brass with 5 to 15 Percent Zinc The low-zinc brasses are easy to cold work, especially those with the higher zinc con- tent. They are ductile but often hard to machine. The corrosion resistance is good. Alloys included in this group are gilding brass (5 percent Zn), commercial bronze (10 percent Zn), and red brass (15 percent Zn). Gilding brass is used mostly for jewelry and articles to be gold-plated; it has the same ductility as copper but greater strength, accompanied by poor machining characteristics. Commercial bronze is used for jewelry and for forgings and stampings, because of its ductility. Its machining properties are poor, but it has excellent cold-working properties. Red brass has good corrosion resistance as well as high-temperature strength. Because of this it is used a great deal in the form of tubing or piping to carry hot water in such applications as radiators or condensers. Brass with 20 to 36 Percent Zinc Included in the intermediate-zinc group are low brass (20 percent Zn), cartridge brass (30 percent Zn), and yellow brass (35 percent Zn). Since zinc is cheaper than copper, these alloys cost less than those with more copper and less zinc. They also have better machinability and slightly greater strength; this is offset, however, by poor corrosion resistance and the possibility of cracking at points of residual stresses. Low brass is very similar to red brass and is used for articles requiring deep-drawing operations. Of the copper-zinc alloys, cartridge brass has the best combination of ductility and strength. Cartridge cases were originally manufactured entirely by cold working; the process consisted of a series of deep draws, each draw being followed by an anneal to place the material in condition for the next draw, hence the name cartridge brass. Although the hot-working ability of yellow brass is poor, it can be used in practically any other fab- ricating process and is therefore employed in a large variety of products. When small amounts of lead are added to the brasses, their machinability is greatly improved and there is some improvement in their abilities to be hot-worked. The addition of lead impairs both the cold-working and welding properties. In this group are low-leaded brass (321 2percent Zn, 1 2percent Pb), high-leaded brass (34 percent Zn, 2 percent Pb), and free-cutting brass (351 2percent Zn, 3 percent Pb). The low-leaded brass is not only easy to machine but has good cold-working properties. It is used for various screw-machine parts. High-leaded brass, sometimes called engraver’s brass, is used for instrument, lock, and watch parts. Free-cutting brass is also used for screw- machine parts and has good corrosion resistance with excellent mechanical properties.bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:34 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:58 Mechanical Engineering Design Admiralty metal (28 percent Zn) contains 1 percent tin, which imparts excellent cor- rosion resistance, especially to saltwater. It has good strength and ductility but only fair machining and working characteristics. Because of its corrosion resistance it is used in power-plant and chemical equipment. Aluminum brass (22 percent Zn) contains 2 percent aluminum and is used for the same purposes as admiralty metal, because it has nearly the same properties and characteristics. In the form of tubing or piping, it is favored over admiralty metal, because it has better resistance to erosion caused by high-velocity water. Brass with 36 to 40 Percent Zinc Brasses with more than 38 percent zinc are less ductile than cartridge brass and cannot be cold-worked as severely. They are frequently hot-worked and extruded. Muntz metal (40 percent Zn) is low in cost and mildly corrosion-resistant. Naval brass has the same composition as Muntz metal except for the addition of 0.75 percent tin, which con- tributes to the corrosion resistance. Bronze Silicon bronze, containing 3 percent silicon and 1 percent manganese in addition to the copper, has mechanical properties equal to those of mild steel, as well as good corro- sion resistance. It can be hot- or cold-worked, machined, or welded. It is useful wher- ever corrosion resistance combined with strength is required. Phosphor bronze, made with up to 11 percent tin and containing small amounts of phosphorus, is especially resistant to fatigue and corrosion. It has a high tensile strength and a high capacity to absorb energy, and it is also resistant to wear. These properties make it very useful as a spring material. Aluminum bronze is a heat-treatable alloy containing up to 12 percent aluminum. This alloy has strength and corrosion-resistance properties that are better than those of brass, and in addition, its properties may be varied over a wide range by cold working, heat treating, or changing the composition. When iron is added in amounts up to 4 percent, the alloy has a high endurance limit, a high shock resistance, and excellent wear resistance. Beryllium bronze is another heat-treatable alloy, containing about 2 percent beryl- lium. This alloy is very corrosion resistant and has high strength, hardness, and resis- tance to wear. Although it is expensive, it is used for springs and other parts subjected to fatigue loading where corrosion resistance is required. With slight modiﬁcation most copper-based alloys are available in cast form. 2–19 Plastics The term thermoplastics is used to mean any plastic that ﬂows or is moldable when heat is applied to it; the term is sometimes applied to plastics moldable under pressure. Such plastics can be remolded when heated. Athermoset is a plastic for which the polymerization process is ﬁnished in a hot molding press where the plastic is liqueﬁed under pressure. Thermoset plastics cannot be remolded. Table 2–2 lists some of the most widely used thermoplastics, together with some of their characteristics and the range of their properties. Table 2–3, listing some of the thermosets, is similar. These tables are presented for information only and should not be used to make a ﬁnal design decision. The range of properties and characteristics that can be obtained with plastics is very great. The inﬂuence of many factors, such as cost, moldability, coefﬁcient of friction, weathering, impact strength, and the effect of ﬁllers and reinforcements, must be considered. Manufacturers’ catalogs will be found quite helpful in making possible selections.bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:34 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:Materials 59 Table 2–2 The Thermoplastics Source: These data have been obtained from the Machine Design Materials Reference Issue, published by Penton/IPC, Cleveland.

Unlike metallic alloys, the materials in a composite remain distinct from each other at the macroscopic level. Most engineering composites consist of two materials: a reinforcement called a ﬁller and a matrix . The ﬁller provides stiffness and strength; the matrix holds the mate- rial together and serves to transfer load among the discontinuous reinforcements. The most common reinforcements, illustrated in Fig. 2–14, are continuous ﬁbers, either straight or woven, short chopped ﬁbers, and particulates. The most common matrices are various plastic resins although other materials including metals are used. Metals and other traditional engineering materials are uniform, or isotropic, in nature. This means that material properties, such as strength, stiffness, and thermal conductivity, are independent of both position within the material and the choice of coordinate system. The discontinuous nature of composite reinforcements, though, means that material prop- erties can vary with both position and direction. For example, an epoxy resin reinforced with continuous graphite ﬁbers will have very high strength and stiffness in the direction of the ﬁbers, but very low properties normal or transverse to the ﬁbers. For this reason, structures of composite materials are normally constructed of multiple plies (laminates) where each ply is oriented to achieve optimal structural stiffness and strength performance. High strength-to-weight ratios, up to 5 times greater than those of high-strength steels, can be achieved. High stiffness-to-weight ratios can also be obtained, as much as 8 times greater than those of structural metals. For this reason, composite materials are becoming very popular in automotive, marine, aircraft, and spacecraft applications where weight is a premium. The directionality of properties of composite materials increases the complexity of structural analyses. Isotropic materials are fully deﬁned by two engineering constants: Young’s modulus E and Poisson’s ratio ν. A single ply of a composite material, however, requires four constants, deﬁned with respect to the ply coordinate system. The constants are two Young’s moduli (the longitudinal modulus in the direction of the ﬁbers, E1, and the transverse modulus normal to the ﬁbers, E2), one Poisson’s ratio ( ν12, called the major Poisson’s ratio), and one shear modulus ( G12). A ﬁfth constant, the minor Poisson’s ratio, ν21, is determined through the reciprocity relation, ν21/E2=ν12/E1. Combining this with multiple plies oriented at different angles makes structural analysis of complex struc- tures unapproachable by manual techniques. For this reason, computer software is avail- able to calculate the properties of a laminated composite construction.15 Particulate compositeRandomly oriented short fiber compositeUnidirectional continuous fiber compositeWoven fabric compositeFigure 2–14 Composites categorized by type of reinforcement. 14For references see I.

Up to this point in this chapter we have discussed many important material physical properties, various characteristics of typical engineering materials, and various material production pro- cesses. The actual selection of a material for a particular design application can be an easy one, say, based on previous applications (1020 steel is always a good candidate because of its many positive attributes), or the selection process can be as involved and daunting as any design problem with the evaluation of the many material physical, eco- nomical, and processing parameters. There are systematic and optimizing approaches to material selection. Here, for illustration, we will only look at how to approach some material properties. One basic technique is to list all the important material properties associated with the design, e.g., strength, stiffness, and cost. This can be prioritized by using a weighting measure depending on what properties are more important than others. Next, for each property, list all available materials and rank them in order begin- ning with the best material; e.g., for strength, high-strength steel such as 4340 steel should be near the top of the list. For completeness of available materials, this might require a large source of material data. Once the lists are formed, select a manageable amount of materials from the top of each list. From each reduced list select the materi- als that are contained within every list for further review. The materials in the reduced lists can be graded within the list and then weighted according to the importance of each property. M. F. Ashby has developed a powerful systematic method using materials selec- tion charts .16This method has also been implemented in a software package called CES Edupack.17The charts display data of various properties for the families and classes of materials listed in Table 2–4. For example, considering material stiffness properties, a simple bar chart plotting Young’s modulus Eon the yaxis is shown 16M. F.

Each vertical line represents the range of values of Efor a particular material. Only some of the materials are labeled. Now, more material information can be displayed if the xaxis represents another material property, say density. Figure 2–16, called a “bubble” chart, represents Young’s modulus Eplotted against density ρ. The line ranges for each material property plotted two-dimensionally now form ellipses, or bubbles. Groups of bubbles outlined according to the material families of Table 2–4 are also shown. This plot is more useful than the two separate bar charts of each property. Now, we also see how stiffness/weight for various materials relate. The ratio of Young’s modulus to density, E/H20862r, is known as the speciﬁc modulus, or specific stiffness. This ratio is of particular interest when it is desired to minimize weight where the primary design limitation is deﬂection, stiffness, or natural frequency, rather than strength. Machine parts made from materials with higher speciﬁc modulus will exhibit lower deﬂection, higher stiffness, and higher natural frequency. In the lower right corner of the chart in Figure 2–16, dotted lines indicate ratios of Eb/H20862r. Several parallel dotted lines are shown for b=1 that represent different values of the speciﬁc modulus E/H20862r. This allows simple comparison of the speciﬁc modulus between materials. It can be seen, for example, that some woods and aluminum alloys have about the same speciﬁc modulus as steels.

The relationship is linear ( β=1) for axial loading, but nonlinear ( β=1/H208622) for bending loading [see Eq. (2–31) and its development]. Since the plot is on a log-log scale, the exponential functions still plot as straight lines. The β=1 lines can also be used to represent constant values of the speed of sound in a material, since the rela- tionship between Eand ris linear in the equation for the speed of sound in a material, c=(E/H20862r)1/H208622. The same can be shown for natural frequency, which is a function of the ratio of stiffness to mass. To see how βﬁts into the mix, consider the following.

For illustration, say we want to design a light, stiff, end-loaded cantilever beam with a circular cross section. For this we will use the mass mof the beam for the performance metric to minimize. The stiffness of the beam is related to its material and geometry. The stiffness of a beam is given by k=F/δ, where Fand δare the end load and deﬂection, respectively (see Chap. 4). The end deﬂection of an end-loaded cantilever beam is given in Table A–9, beam 1, as δ=ymax=(Fl3)/(3EI), where Eis Young’s modulus, Ithe second moment of the area, and lthe length of the beam.

Thus, f1(F)=2√π/3(k1/2)is the func- tional requirement, stiffness; f2(G)=(l5/2), the geometric parameter, length; and the material efﬁciency coefﬁcient f3(M)=ρ E1/2(2–30) is the material property in terms of density and Young’s modulus. To minimize mwe want to minimize f3(M), or maximize M=E1/2 ρ(2–31) where Mis called the material index, and β=1 Returning to Fig. 2–16, draw lines of various values of E1/2/ρas shown in Fig. 2–17. Lines of increasing Mmove up and to the left as shown. Thus, we see that good candidates for a light, stiff, end-loaded can- tilever beam with a circular cross section are certain woods, composites, and ceramics. Other limits/constraints may warrant further investigation. Say, for further illustra- tion, the design requirements indicate that we need a Young’s modulus greater thanMaterials 65bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:35 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:66 Mechanical Engineering Design Index E1/2//H9267 /H11005 3 Modulus E /H11005 50 GPaModulus–density CompositesCeramics Metals1000 100 10 1 0.1 0.010.1 1 10 100Woods FoamsElastomersPolymers MFA 04 Density, Mg/m3Young's modulus E, GPaSearch regionFigure 2–18 The search region of Fig. 2–16 further reduced by restricting E ≥50GPa, (From M.

Figure 2–18 shows how this further restricts the search region. This eliminates woods as a possible material. Another commonly useful chart, shown in Fig. 2–19, represents strength versus density for the material families. The ratio of strength to density is known as speciﬁc strength, and is particularly useful when it is desired to minimize weight where the pri- mary design limitation is strength, rather than deﬂection. The guidelines in the lower right corner represent different relationships between strength and density, in the form of Sb/H20862r. Following an approach similar to that used before, it can be shown that for axial loading, b=1, and for bending loading, b=2/H208623. Certainly, in a given design exercise, there will be other considerations such as environment, cost, availability, and machinability, and other charts may be necessary to investigate. Also, we have not brought in the material process selection part of the pic- ture. If done properly, material selection can result in a good deal of bookkeeping. This is where software packages such as CES Edupack become very effective.bud29281_ch02_031-070.qxd 11/11/09 09:35 PM Debd Hard Disk1:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Satya 10/11/09:PROBLEMS 2–1 Determine the tensile and yield strengths for the following materials: (a) UNS G10200 hot-rolled steel.

Although earlier discussion has described structural strength in terms of load or stress versus strength, failure of function for structural reasons may arise from other factors such as excessive deformations or deﬂections. Here it is assumed that the reader has completed basic courses in statics of rigid bodies and mechanics of materials and is quite familiar with the analysis of loads, and the stresses and deformations associated with the basic load states of simple prismatic elements. In this chapter and Chap. 4 we will review and extend these topics brieﬂy. Complete derivations will not be presented here, and the reader is urged to return to basic textbooks and notes on these subjects. This chapter begins with a review of equilibrium and free-body diagrams associated with load-carrying components. One must understand the nature of forces before attempting to perform an extensive stress or deﬂection analysis of a mechanical com- ponent. An extremely useful tool in handling discontinuous loading of structures employs Macaulay or singularity functions . Singularity functions are described in Sec. 3–3 as applied to the shear forces and bending moments in beams. In Chap. 4, the use of singularity functions will be expanded to show their real power in handling deﬂections of complex geometry and statically indeterminate problems. Machine components transmit forces and motion from one point to another. The transmission of force can be envisioned as a ﬂow or force distribution that can be fur- ther visualized by isolating internal surfaces within the component. Force distributed over a surface leads to the concept of stress, stress components, and stress transforma- tions (Mohr’s circle) for all possible surfaces at a point. The remainder of the chapter is devoted to the stresses associated with the basic loading of prismatic elements, such as uniform loading, bending, and torsion, and topics with major design ramiﬁcations such as stress concentrations, thin- and thick-walled pressurized cylinders, rotating rings, press and shrink ﬁts, thermal stresses, curved beams, and contact stresses. 3–1 Equilibrium and Free-Body Diagrams Equilibrium The word system will be used to denote any isolated part or portion of a machine or structure—including all of it if desired—that we wish to study. A system, under this deﬁnition, may consist of a particle, several particles, a part of a rigid body, an entire rigid body, or even several rigid bodies. If we assume that the system to be studied is motionless or, at most, has constant velocity, then the system has zero acceleration. Under this condition the system is said to be in equilibrium . The phrase static equilibrium is also used to imply that the system isat rest . For equilibrium, the forces and moments acting on the system balance such that /summationdisplay F=0 (3–1) /summationdisplay M=0 (3–2) which states that the sum of all force and the sum of all moment vectors acting upon a system in equilibrium is zero .bud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:01PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Load and Stress Analysis 73 Free-Body Diagrams We can greatly simplify the analysis of a very complex structure or machine by suc- cessively isolating each element and studying and analyzing it by the use of free-body diagrams . When all the members have been treated in this manner, the knowledge obtained can be assembled to yield information concerning the behavior of the total sys- tem. Thus, free-body diagramming is essentially a means of breaking a complicated problem into manageable segments, analyzing these simple problems, and then, usually, putting the information together again. Using free-body diagrams for force analysis serves the following important purposes: •The diagram establishes the directions of reference axes, provides a place to record the dimensions of the subsystem and the magnitudes and directions of the known forces, and helps in assuming the directions of unknown forces. •The diagram simpliﬁes your thinking because it provides a place to store one thought while proceeding to the next. •The diagram provides a means of communicating your thoughts clearly and unam- biguously to other people. •Careful and complete construction of the diagram clariﬁes fuzzy thinking by bringing out various points that are not always apparent in the statement or in the geometry of the total problem. Thus, the diagram aids in understanding all facets of the problem. •The diagram helps in the planning of a logical attack on the problem and in setting up the mathematical relations. •The diagram helps in recording progress in the solution and in illustrating the methods used. •The diagram allows others to follow your reasoning, showing allforces. EXAMPLE 3–1 Figure 3–1 ashows a simpliﬁed rendition of a gear reducer where the input and output shafts ABandCDare rotating at constant speeds ωiand ωo, respectively. The input and output torques (torsional moments) are Ti=240 lbf ·in and To, respectively. The shafts are supported in the housing by bearings at A, B, C, and D. The pitch radii of gears G1 and G2are r1=0.75 in and r2=1.5 in, respectively. Draw the free-body diagrams of each member and determine the net reaction forces and moments at all points. Solution First, we will list all simplifying assumptions. 1Gears G1and G2are simple spur gears with a standard pressure angle φ=20° (see Sec. 13–5). 2The bearings are self-aligning and the shafts can be considered to be simply supported. 3The weight of each member is negligible. 4Friction is negligible. 5The mounting bolts at E, F, H, and Iare the same size. The separate free-body diagrams of the members are shown in Figs. 3–1 b–d. Note that Newton’s third law, called the law of action and reaction, is used extensively where each member mates. The force transmitted between the spur gears is not tangential but at the pressure angle φ. Thus, N=Ftan φ.bud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:01PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:74 Mechanical Engineering Design Summing moments about the xaxis of shaft ABin Fig. 3–1 dgives /summationdisplay Mx=F(0.75)−240=0 F=320 lbf The normal force is N=320 tan 20° =116.5 lbf. Using the equilibrium equations for Figs. 3–1 candd, the reader should verify that: RAy=192lbf,RAz=69.9lbf,RBy=128lbf,RBz=46.6lbf,RCy=192lbf,RCz= 69.9lbf,RDy=128lbf,RDz=46.6lbf, and To=480lbf·in. The direction of the output torque Tois opposite ωobecause it is the resistive load on the system opposing the motion ωo. Note in Fig. 3–1 bthe net force from the bearing reactions is zero whereas the net moment about the xaxis is (1.5 +0.75) (192) +(1.5+0.75) (128) =720 lbf ·in. This value is the same as Ti+To=240+480 =720 lbf ·in, as shown in Fig. 3–1 a. The reaction forces RE,RF,RH,and RI,from the mounting bolts cannot be determined from the equilibrium equations as there are too many unknowns. Only three equations are available, /summationtextFy=/summationtextFz=/summationtextMx=0.In case you were wondering about assump- tion 5, here is where we will use it (see Sec. 8–12).

The center of rotation relative to the bolts lies at the centroid of the bolt cross-sectional areas. Thus if the bolt areas are equal: the center of rotation is at the center of the four bolts, a distance of/radicalbig (4/2)2+(5/2)2=3.202in from each bolt; the bolt forces are equal (RE=RF=RH=RI=R), and each bolt force is perpendicular to the line from the bolt to the center of rotation. This gives a net torque from the four bolts of 4R(3.202)=720. Thus, RE=RF=RH=RI=56.22lbf. 3–2 Shear Force and Bending Moments in Beams Figure 3–2 a shows a beam supported by reactions R1and R2and loaded by the con- centrated forces F1,F2,and F3.If the beam is cut at some section located at x=x1and the left-hand portion is removed as a free body, an internal shear force V and bending moment M must act on the cut surface to ensure equilibrium (see Fig. 3–2 b). The shear force is obtained by summing the forces on the isolated section. The bending moment is the sum of the moments of the forces to the left of the section taken about an axis through the isolated section. The sign conventions used for bending moment and shear force in this book are shown in Fig. 3–3. Shear force and bending moment are related by the equation V=dM dx(3–3) Sometimes the bending is caused by a distributed load q(x), as shown in Fig. 3–4; q(x)is called the load intensity with units of force per unit length and is positive in the Figure 3–2 Free-body diagram of simply- supported beam with Vand M shown in positive directions.

It can be shown that differentiating Eq. (3–3) results in dV dx=d2M dx2=q (3–4) Normally the applied distributed load is directed downward and labeled w(e.g., see Fig. 3–6). In this case, w=−q. Equations (3–3) and (3–4) reveal additional relations if they are integrated.

By their use, general expressions for shear force and bending moment in beams can be written when the beam is loaded by concentrated moments or forces. As shown in the table, the concentrated moment and force functions are zero for all values of xnot equal to a. The functions are undeﬁned for values of x=a.Note that the unit step and ramp functions are zero only for values of xthat are less than a. The integration properties shown in the table con- stitute a part of the mathematical deﬁnition too. The ﬁrst two integrations of q(x)for V(x)and M(x)do not require constants of integration provided allloads on the beam are accounted for in q(x). The examples that follow show how these functions are used. EXAMPLE 3–2 Derive the loading, shear-force, and bending-moment relations for the beam of Fig. 3–5 a.

Note that the impulse terms in Eq. (2), −M1/angbracketleftx/angbracketright−1and −240/angbracketleftx−10/angbracketright−1, are physically not forces and are not shown in the Vdiagram. Also note that both the M1and 240 lbf ·in moments are counterclockwise and negative singularity functions; however, by the con- vention shown in Fig. 3–2 the M1and 240 lbf ·in are negative and positive bending moments, respectively, which is reﬂected in Fig. 3–6 c. 3–4 Stress When an internal surface is isolated as in Fig. 3–2 b, the net force and moment acting on the surface manifest themselves as force distributions across the entire area. The force distribution acting at a point on the surface is unique and will have components in the normal and tangential directions called normal stress and tangential shear stress , respectively. Normal and shear stresses are labeled by the Greek symbols σand τ, respectively. If the direction of σis outward from the surface it is considered to be a ten- sile stress and is a positive normal stress. If σis into the surface it is a compressive stress and commonly considered to be a negative quantity. The units of stress in U.S. Customary units are pounds per square inch (psi). For SI units, stress is in newtons per square meter (N/m2);1N/m2=1pascal (Pa). 3–5 Cartesian Stress Components The Cartesian stress components are established by deﬁning three mutually orthogo- nal surfaces at a point within the body. The normals to each surface will establish the x, y, z Cartesian axes. In general, each surface will have a normal and shear stress. The shear stress may have components along two Cartesian axes. For example, Fig. 3–7 shows an inﬁnitesimal surface area isolation at a point Qwithin a body where the sur- face normal is the xdirection. The normal stress is labeled σx. The symbol σindi- cates a normal stress and the subscript xindicates the direction of the surface normal. The net shear stress acting on the surface is (τx)netwhich can be resolved into com- ponents in the yand zdirections, labeled as τxyand τxz, respectively (see Fig. 3–7).

The ﬁrst subscript indicates the direction of the surface normal whereas the second subscript is the direction of the shear stress. The state of stress at a point described by three mutually perpendicular surfaces is shown in Fig. 3–8 a. It can be shown through coordinate transformation that this is suf- ﬁcient to determine the state of stress on anysurface intersecting the point. As the dimensions of the cube in Fig. 3–8 aapproach zero, the stresses on the hidden faces become equal and opposite to those on the opposing visible faces. Thus, in general, a complete state of stress is deﬁned by nine stress components, σx,σ y,σ z,τ xy, τxz,τyx,τyz,τzx,and τzy. For equilibrium, in most cases, “cross-shears” are equal, hence τyx=τxy τzy=τyz τxz=τzx (3–7) This reduces the number of stress components for most three-dimensional states of stress from nine to six quantities, σx,σy,σz,τxy,τyz,andτzx. A very common state of stress occurs when the stresses on one surface are zero. When this occurs the state of stress is called plane stress . Figure 3–8 bshows a state of plane stress, arbitrarily assuming that the normal for the stress-free surface is the zdirection such that σz=τzx=τzy=0.It is important to note that the element in Fig. 3–8 bis still a three-dimensional cube. Also, here it is assumed that the cross-shears are equal such that τyx=τxy,and τyz=τzy=τxz=τzx=0. 3–6 Mohr’s Circle for Plane Stress Suppose the dx dy dz element of Fig. 3–8 bis cut by an oblique plane with a normal nat an arbitrary angle φcounterclockwise from the xaxis as shown in Fig. 3–9. Here, we are concerned with the stresses σand τthat act upon this oblique plane. By summing the forces caused by all the stress components to zero, the stresses σand τare found to be σ=σx+σy 2+σx−σy 2cos 2φ+τxysin 2φ (3–8) τ=−σx−σy 2sin 2φ+τxycos 2φ (3–9) Equations (3–8) and (3–9) are called the plane-stress transformation equations .yy x/H9268y /H9270yx /H9270xy/H9270xy /H9270xy/H9270xy/H9270xy /H9270xz/H9268x /H9268x /H9268y/H9268x/H9268y /H9268zx z/H9270yz /H9270zy /H9270zx (a)( b)Figure 3–8 (a) General three-dimensional stress.

(3–8) with respect to φand setting the result equal to zero maximizes σand gives tan 2φp=2τxy σx−σy(3–10) Equation (3–10) deﬁnes two particular values for the angle 2φp,one of which deﬁnes the maximum normal stress σ1and the other, the minimum normal stress σ2. These two stresses are called the principal stresses, and their corresponding directions, the princi- pal directions. The angle between the two principal directions is 90°. It is important to note that Eq. (3–10) can be written in the form σx−σy 2sin 2φp−τxycos 2φp=0 (a) Comparing this with Eq. (3–9), we see that τ=0, meaning that the perpendicular sur- faces containing principal stresses have zero shear stresses . In a similar manner, we differentiate Eq. (3–9), set the result equal to zero, and obtain tan 2φs=−σx−σy 2τxy(3–11) Equation (3–11) deﬁnes the two values of 2φsat which the shear stress τreaches an extreme value. The angle between the two surfaces containing the maximum shear stresses is 90°. Equation (3–11) can also be written as σx−σy 2cos 2φp+τxysin 2φp=0 (b) Substituting this into Eq. (3–8) yields σ=σx+σy 2(3–12) Equation (3–12) tells us that the two surfaces containing the maximum shear stresses also contain equal normal stresses of (σx+σy)/2. Comparing Eqs. (3–10) and (3–11), we see that tan 2φsis the negative reciprocal of tan 2φp.This means that 2φsand 2φpare angles 90° apart, and thus the angles between the surfaces containing the maximum shear stresses and the surfaces contain- ing the principal stresses are ±45◦. Formulas for the two principal stresses can be obtained by substituting the angle 2φpfrom Eq. (3–10) in Eq. (3–8).

See Sec. 3–7. It is important to note that the equations given to this point are quite sufﬁcient for performing any plane stress transformation. However, extreme care must be exercised when applying them. For example, say you are attempting to determine the principal state of stress for a problem where σx=14 MPa ,σy=−10 MPa ,and τxy=−16 MPa . Equation (3–10) yields φp=−26.57◦and 63.43°, which locate the principal stress sur- faces, whereas, Eq. (3–13) gives σ1=22MPa and σ2=−18MPa for the principal stresses. If all we wanted was the principal stresses, we would be ﬁnished. However, what if we wanted to draw the element containing the principal stresses properly ori- ented relative to the x, yaxes? Well, we have two values of φpand two values for the principal stresses. How do we know which value of φpcorresponds to which value of the principal stress? To clear this up we would need to substitute one of the values of φpinto Eq. (3–8) to determine the normal stress corresponding to that angle. A graphical method for expressing the relations developed in this section, called Mohr’s circle diagram, is a very effective means of visualizing the stress state at a point and keeping track of the directions of the various components associated with plane stress. Equations (3–8) and (3–9) can be shown to be a set of parametric equations for σand τ, where the parameter is 2φ.The parametric relationship between σand τis that of a cir- cle plotted in the σ,τ plane, where the center of the circle is located at C=(σ,τ) = [(σx+σy)/2,0]and has a radius of R=/radicalBig [(σx−σy)/2]2+τ2xy.A problem arises in the sign of the shear stress. The transformation equations are based on a positive φ being counterclockwise, as shown in Fig. 3–9. If a positive τwere plotted above the σaxis, points would rotate clockwise on the circle 2φin the opposite direction of rotation on the element. It would be convenient if the rotations were in the same direction. One could solve the problem easily by plotting positive τbelow the axis. However, the classical approach to Mohr’s circle uses a different convention for the shear stress. Mohr’s Circle Shear Convention This convention is followed in drawing Mohr’s circle: •Shear stresses tending to rotate the element clockwise (cw) are plotted above the σaxis. •Shear stresses tending to rotate the element counterclockwise (ccw) are plotted below the σaxis. For example, consider the right face of the element in Fig. 3–8 b. By Mohr’s circle con- vention the shear stress shown is plotted below the σaxis because it tends to rotate the element counterclockwise. The shear stress on the top face of the element is plotted above the σaxis because it tends to rotate the element clockwise. In Fig. 3–10 we create a coordinate system with normal stresses plotted along the abscissa and shear stresses plotted as the ordinates. On the abscissa, tensile (positive) normal stresses are plotted to the right of the origin Oand compressive (negative) nor- mal stresses to the left. On the ordinate, clockwise (cw) shear stresses are plotted up; counterclockwise (ccw) shear stresses are plotted down.bud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:01PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Using the stress state of Fig. 3–8 b, we plot Mohr’s circle, Fig. 3–10, by ﬁrst look- ing at the right surface of the element containing σxto establish the sign of σxand the cw or ccw direction of the shear stress. The right face is called the x face where φ=0◦.If σxis positive and the shear stress τxyis ccw as shown in Fig. 3–8 b, we can establish point Awith coordinates (σx,τccw xy)in Fig. 3–10. Next, we look at the top y face, where φ=90◦,which contains σy,and repeat the process to obtain point Bwith coordinates (σy,τcw xy)as shown in Fig. 3–10. The two states of stress for the element are /Delta1φ=90◦from each other on the element so they will be 2/Delta1φ=180◦from each other on Mohr’s circle. Points Aand Bare the same vertical distance from the σaxis. Thus, ABmust be on the diameter of the circle, and the center of the circle Cis where ABintersects the σaxis. With points Aand Bon the circle, and center C, the complete circle can then be drawn. Note that the extended ends of line ABare labeled xand y as references to the normals to the surfaces for which points Aand Brepresent the stresses. The entire Mohr’s circle represents the state of stress at a single point in a struc- ture. Each point on the circle represents the stress state for a speciﬁc surface intersect- ing the point in the structure. Each pair of points on the circle 180° apart represent the state of stress on an element whose surfaces are 90° apart. Once the circle is drawn, the states of stress can be visualized for various surfaces intersecting the point being ana- lyzed. For example, the principal stresses σ1and σ2are points Dand E, respectively, and their values obviously agree with Eq. (3–13). We also see that the shear stresses are zero on the surfaces containing σ1and σ2. The two extreme-value shear stresses, one clockwise and one counterclockwise, occur at Fand G with magnitudes equal to the radius of the circle. The surfaces at Fand Geach also contain normal stresses of (σx+σy)/2as noted earlier in Eq. (3–12). Finally, the state of stress on an arbitrary surface located at an angle φcounterclockwise from the xface is point H.Load and Stress Analysis 83 /H9268x /H9268y (/H9268x – /H9268y) O /H9268x + /H9268y 2/H9268x – /H9268y 2F (/H9268y , /H9270xycw) (/H9268x , /H9270ccw)yB C GDH E/H9270xy /H9268y /H92682/H9268/H92681 /H9268x2/H9278 A2/H9278p/H9270xy x/H9270cw /H9270ccw/H9268x – /H9268y2 + /H92702 xy/H20898/H20899/H20906 2 xyFigure 3–10 Mohr’s circle diagram.bud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:01PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:84 Mechanical Engineering Design At one time, Mohr’s circle was used graphically where it was drawn to scale very accurately and values were measured by using a scale and protractor. Here, we are strictly using Mohr’s circle as a visualization aid and will use a semigraphical approach, calculat- ing values from the properties of the circle. This is illustrated by the following example. EXAMPLE 3–4 A stress element has σx=80MPa and τxy=50MPa cw, as shown in Fig. 3–11 a. (a) Using Mohr’s circle, ﬁnd the principal stresses and directions, and show these on a stress element correctly aligned with respect to the xycoordinates. Draw another stress element to show τ1and τ2, ﬁnd the corresponding normal stresses, and label the drawing completely. (b) Repeat part ausing the transformation equations only. Solution (a) In the semigraphical approach used here, we ﬁrst make an approximate freehand sketch of Mohr’s circle and then use the geometry of the ﬁgure to obtain the desired information. Draw the σand τaxes ﬁrst (Fig. 3–11 b) and from the xface locate σx=80MPa along the σaxis. On the xface of the element, we see that the shear stress is 50 MPa in the cw direction. Thus, for the xface, this establishes point A(80, 50cw) MPa. Corresponding to the yface, the stress is σ=0and τ=50MPa in the ccw direction. This locates point B(0, 50ccw) MPa. The line ABforms the diameter of the required cir- cle, which can now be drawn. The intersection of the circle with the σaxis deﬁnes σ1 and σ2as shown. Now, noting the triangle AC D,indicate on the sketch the length of the legs ADand CDas 50 and 40 MPa, respectively. The length of the hypotenuse ACis Answer τ1=/radicalbig (50)2+(40)2=64.0M P a and this should be labeled on the sketch too. Since intersection Cis 40 MPa from the origin, the principal stresses are now found to be Answer σ1=40+64=104 MPa and σ2=40−64=−24 MPa The angle 2φfrom the xaxis cw to σ1is Answer 2φp=tan−150 40=51.3◦ To draw the principal stress element (Fig. 3–11 c), sketch the xandyaxes parallel to the original axes. The angle φpon the stress element must be measured in the same direction as is the angle 2φpon the Mohr circle. Thus, from xmeasure 25.7° (half of 51.3°) clockwise to locate the σ1axis. The σ2axis is 90° from the σ1axis and the stress element can now be completed and labeled as shown. Note that there are noshear stresses on this element. The two maximum shear stresses occur at points Eand Fin Fig. 3–11 b. The two normal stresses corresponding to these shear stresses are each 40 MPa, as indicated. Point Eis 38.7° ccw from point Aon Mohr’s circle. Therefore, in Fig. 3–11 d, draw a stress element oriented 19.3° (half of 38.7°) ccw from x. The element should then be labeled with magnitudes and directions as shown. In constructing these stress elements it is important to indicate the xand ydirec- tions of the original reference system. This completes the link between the original machine element and the orientation of its principal stresses.bud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:01PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Load and Stress Analysis 85 (b) The transformation equations are programmable.

(3–9) again yields τ=0,indicating that −24.03 MPa is also a principal stress. Once the principal stresses are calculated they can be ordered such that σ1≥σ2.Thus, σ1=104.03MPa and σ2=−24.03MPa.Answer Since for σ1=104.03MPa, φp=−25.7◦,and since φis deﬁned positive ccw in the transformation equations, we rotate clockwise 25.7° for the surface containing σ1.We see in Fig. 3–11 cthat this totally agrees with the semigraphical method.

(3–8) and (3–9) yield Answer σ=80+0 2+80−0 2cos[2(19.3)]+(−50)sin[2(19.3)]=40.0M P a τ=−80−0 2sin[2(19.3)]+(−50)cos[2(19.3)]=−64.0M P a Remember that Eqs. (3–8) and (3–9) are coordinate transformation equations. Imagine that we are rotating the x, yaxes 19.3° counterclockwise and ywill now point up and to the left. So a negative shear stress on the rotated xface will point down and to the right as shown in Fig. 3–11 d. Thus again, results agree with the semigraphical method. For φs=109.3◦,Eqs. (3–8) and (3–9) give σ=40.0MPa and τ=+64.0MPa. Using the same logic for the coordinate transformation we ﬁnd that results again agree with Fig. 3–11 d. 3–7 General Three-Dimensional Stress As in the case of plane stress, a particular orientation of a stress element occurs in space for which all shear-stress components are zero. When an element has this particular ori- entation, the normals to the faces are mutually orthogonal and correspond to the prin- cipal directions, and the normal stresses associated with these faces are the principal stresses. Since there are three faces, there are three principal directions and three prin- cipal stresses σ1,σ2,and σ3. For plane stress, the stress-free surface contains the third principal stress which is zero. In our studies of plane stress we were able to specify any stress state σx, σy, and τxyand find the principal stresses and principal directions. But six components of stress are required to specify a general state of stress in three dimensions, and the problem of determining the principal stresses and directions is more difficult. In design, three-dimensional transformations are rarely performed since most maxi- mum stress states occur under plane stress conditions. One notable exception is con- tact stress, which is not a case of plane stress, where the three principal stresses are given in Sec. 3–19. In fact, allstates of stress are truly three-dimensional, where they might be described one- or two-dimensionally with respect to specific coordi- nate axes. Here it is most important to understand the relationship among the three principal stresses. The process in finding the three principal stresses from the sixbud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:01PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Load and Stress Analysis 87 stress components σx,σy,σz,τxy,τyz,and τzx,involves finding the roots of the cubic equation1 σ3−(σx+σy+σz)σ2+/parenleftbig σxσy+σxσz+σyσz−τ2 xy−τ2 yz−τ2 zx/parenrightbig σ −/parenleftbig σxσyσz+2τxyτyzτzx−σxτ2 yz−σyτ2 zx−σzτ2 xy/parenrightbig =0 (3–15) In plotting Mohr’s circles for three-dimensional stress, the principal normal stresses are ordered so that σ1≥σ2≥σ3. Then the result appears as in Fig. 3–12 a. The stress coordinates σ, τfor any arbitrarily located plane will always lie on the bound- aries or within the shaded area. Figure 3–12 aalso shows the three principal shear stresses τ1/2,τ2/3, and τ1/3.2 Each of these occurs on the two planes, one of which is shown in Fig. 3–12 b. The ﬁg- ure shows that the principal shear stresses are given by the equations τ1/2=σ1−σ2 2τ2/3=σ2−σ3 2τ1/3=σ1−σ3 2(3–16) Of course, τmax=τ1/3when the normal principal stresses are ordered (σ1>σ 2>σ 3), so always order your principal stresses. Do this in any computer code you generate and you’ll always generate τmax. 3–8 Elastic Strain Normal strain /epsilon1is deﬁned and discussed in Sec. 2–1 for the tensile specimen and is given by Eq. (2–2) as /epsilon1=δ/l, where δis the total elongation of the bar within the length l. Hooke’s law for the tensile specimen is given by Eq. (2–3) as σ=E/epsilon1 (3–17) where the constant Eis called Young’s modulus or the modulus of elasticity ./H92701/2/H92701/3/H9270 /H92702/3 /H92681 /H92682 /H92683/H9268 (b) (a)/H92701/2 /H92681/H9268 /H92682Figure 3–12 Mohr’s circles for three- dimensional stress. 1For development of this equation and further elaboration of three-dimensional stress transformations see: Richard G. Budynas, Advanced Strength and Applied Stress Analysis, 2nd ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1999, pp. 46–78. 2Note the difference between this notation and that for a shear stress, say, τxy. The use of the shilling mark is not accepted practice, but it is used here to emphasize the distinction.bud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:01PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:88 Mechanical Engineering Design When a material is placed in tension, there exists not only an axial strain, but also negative strain (contraction) perpendicular to the axial strain. Assuming a linear, homogeneous, isotropic material, this lateral strain is proportional to the axial strain. If the axial direction is x, then the lateral strains are /epsilon1y=/epsilon1z=−ν/epsilon1x.The constant of pro- portionality vis called Poisson’s ratio, which is about 0.3 for most structural metals. See Table A–5 for values of vfor common materials. If the axial stress is in the xdirection, then from Eq. (3–17) /epsilon1x=σx E/epsilon1y=/epsilon1z=−νσx E(3–18) For a stress element undergoing σx,σy, and σzsimultaneously, the normal strains are given by /epsilon1x=1 E/bracketleftbig σx−ν(σy+σz)/bracketrightbig /epsilon1y=1 E/bracketleftbig σy−ν(σx+σz)/bracketrightbig (3–19) /epsilon1z=1 E/bracketleftbig σz−ν(σx+σy)/bracketrightbig Shear strain γis the change in a right angle of a stress element when subjected to pure shear stress, and Hooke’s law for shear is given by τ=Gγ (3–20) where the constant Gis the shear modulus of elasticity ormodulus of rigidity . It can be shown for a linear, isotropic, homogeneous material, the three elastic con- stants are related to each other by E=2G(1+ν) (3–21) 3–9 Uniformly Distributed Stresses The assumption of a uniform distribution of stress is frequently made in design. The result is then often called pure tension, pure compression, or pure shear, depending upon how the external load is applied to the body under study. The word simple is some- times used instead of pure to indicate that there are no other complicating effects. The tension rod is typical. Here a tension load Fis applied through pins at the ends of the bar. The assumption of uniform stress means that if we cut the bar at a section remote from the ends and remove one piece, we can replace its effect by applying a uni- formly distributed force of magnitude σAto the cut end. So the stress σis said to be uniformly distributed. It is calculated from the equation σ=F A(3–22) This assumption of uniform stress distribution requires that: •The bar be straight and of a homogeneous material •The line of action of the force contains the centroid of the section •The section be taken remote from the ends and from any discontinuity or abrupt change in cross sectionbud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:01PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Load and Stress Analysis 89 For simple compression, Eq. (3–22) is applicable with Fnormally being consid- ered a negative quantity. Also, a slender bar in compression may fail by buckling, and this possibility must be eliminated from consideration before Eq. (3–22) is used.3 Another type of loading that assumes a uniformly distributed stress is known as direct shear. This occurs when there is a shearing action with no bending. An example is the action on a piece of sheet metal caused by the two blades of tin snips. Bolts and pins that are loaded in shear often have direct shear. Think of a cantilever beam with a force pushing down on it. Now move the force all the way up to the wall so there is no bending moment, just a force trying to shear the beam off the wall. This is direct shear. Direct shear is usually assumed to be uniform across the cross section, and is given by τ=V A(3–23) where Vis the shear force and Ais the area of the cross section that is being sheared. The assumption of uniform stress is not accurate, particularly in the vicinity where the force is applied, but the assumption generally gives acceptable results. 3–10 Normal Stresses for Beams in Bending The equations for the normal bending stresses in straight beams are based on the fol- lowing assumptions. •The beam is subjected to pure bending. This means that the shear force is zero, and that no torsion or axial loads are present (for most engineering applications it is as- sumed that these loads affect the bending stresses minimally). •The material is isotropic and homogeneous. •The material obeys Hooke’s law. •The beam is initially straight with a cross section that is constant throughout the beam length. •The beam has an axis of symmetry in the plane of bending. •The proportions of the beam are such that it would fail by bending rather than by crushing, wrinkling, or sidewise buckling. •Plane cross sections of the beam remain plane during bending. In Fig. 3–13 we visualize a portion of a straight beam acted upon by a positive bending moment Mshown by the curved arrow showing the physical action of the moment together with a straight arrow indicating the moment vector. The xaxis is coincident with the neutral axis of the section, and the xzplane, which contains the 3See Sec. 4–11.Figure 3–13 Straight beam in positive bending.

Elements of the beam coincident with this plane have zero stress. The location of the neutral axis with respect to the cross section is coincident with the centroidal axis of the cross section. The bending stress varies linearly with the distance from the neutral axis, y, and is given by σx=−My I(3–24) where Iis the second-area moment about the zaxis. That is, I=/integraldisplay y2dA (3–25) The stress distribution given by Eq. (3–24) is shown in Fig. 3–14. The maximum magni- tude of the bending stress will occur where yhas the greatest magnitude. Designating σmax as the maximum magnitude of the bending stress, and cas the maximum magnitude of y σmax=Mc I(3–26 a) Equation (3–24) can still be used to ascertain whether σmaxis tensile or compressive. Equation (3–26 a) is often written as σmax=M Z(3–26 b) where Z =I/cis called the section modulus. EXAMPLE 3–5 A beam having a T section with the dimensions shown in Fig. 3–15 is subjected to a bend- ing moment of 1600 N · m, about the negative zaxis, that causes tension at the top surface. Locate the neutral axis and ﬁnd the maximum tensile and compressive bending stresses. Solution Dividing the T section into two rectangles, numbered 1 and 2, the total area is A/H1100512(75) /H1100112(88) /H110051956 mm2. Summing the area moments of these rectangles about the top edge, where the moment arms of areas 1 and 2 are 6 mm and (12 /H11001 88/2) /H11005 56 mm respectively, we have 1956 c1=12(75)(6)+12(88)(56) and hence c1=32.99mm. Therefore c2=100−32.99=67.01mm. Next we calculate the second moment of area of each rectangle about its own cen- troidal axis.

For the bottom rectangle, we have I2=1 12(12)883=6.815×105mm4 We now employ the parallel-axis theorem to obtain the second moment of area of the composite ﬁgure about its own centroidal axis. This theorem states Iz=Ica+Ad2 where Icais the second moment of area about its own centroidal axis and Izis the sec- ond moment of area about any parallel axis a distance dremoved. For the top rectan- gle, the distance is d1=32.99−6=26.99 mm and for the bottom rectangle, d2=67.01−88 2=23.01 mm Using the parallel-axis theorem for both rectangles, we now ﬁnd that I=[1.080×104+12(75)26 .992]+[6.815×105+12(88)23 .012] =1.907×106mm4 Finally, the maximum tensile stress, which occurs at the top surface, is found to be Answer σ=Mc 1 I=1600(32 .99)10−3 1.907(10−6)=27.68(106)P a=27.68 MPa Similarly, the maximum compressive stress at the lower surface is found to be Answer σ=−Mc 2 I=−1600(67 .01)10−3 1.907(10−6)=−56.22(106)P a=−56.22 MPabud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:01PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:92 Mechanical Engineering Design Two-Plane Bending Quite often, in mechanical design, bending occurs in both xyand xzplanes. Considering cross sections with one or two planes of symmetry only, the bending stresses are given by σx=−Mzy Iz+Myz Iy(3–27) where the ﬁrst term on the right side of the equation is identical to Eq. (3–24), Myis the bending moment in the xzplane (moment vector in ydirection), zis the distance from the neutral yaxis, and Iyis the second area moment about the yaxis. For noncircular cross sections, Eq. (3–27) is the superposition of stresses caused by the two bending moment components. The maximum tensile and compressive bend- ing stresses occur where the summation gives the greatest positive and negative stresses, respectively. For solid circular cross sections, all lateral axes are the same and the plane containing the moment corresponding to the vector sum of MzandMycontains the maximum bending stresses. For a beam of diameter dthe maximum distance from the neutral axis is d/2, and from Table A–18, I=πd4/64. The maximum bending stress for a solid circular cross section is then σm=Mc I=(M2 y+M2 z)1/2(d/2) πd4/64=32 πd3(M2 y+M2 z)1/2(3–28) EXAMPLE 3–6 As shown in Fig. 3–16 a, beam OCis loaded in the xyplane by a uniform load of 50 lbf/in, and in the xzplane by a concentrated force of 100 lbf at end C.The beam is 8 in long. 50 lbf/in CA z x1.5 in 0.75 in (a)y BO 100 lbf50 lbf/in 1600 lbf-in Mz (lbf-in) 0 /H110021600400 lbf (b)x xC Oy 100 lbf 100 lbf800 lbf-in My (lbf-in) 800 0 (c)xC O zxFigure 3–16 (a) Beam loaded in two planes; ( b) loading and bending-moment diagrams inxy plane; ( c) loading and bending-moment diagrams inxzplane.bud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:01PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Load and Stress Analysis 93 Beams with Asymmetrical Sections4 The bending stress equations, given by Eqs. (3–24) and (3–27), can also be applied to beams having asymmetrical cross sections, provided the planes of bending coincide with the area principal axes of the section. The method for determining the orientation of the area principal axes and the values of the corresponding principal second-area moments can be found in any statics book. If a section has an axis of symmetry, that axis and its perpendicular axis are the area principal axes. For example, consider a beam in bending, using an equal leg angle as shown in Table A–6. Equation (3–27) cannot be used if the bending moments are resolved about axis 1–1 and/or axis 2–2. However, Eq. (3–27) can be used if the moments are resolved(a) For the cross section shown determine the maximum tensile and compressive bending stresses and where they act.

Note, for this cross section, axis 4–4 is an axis of symmetry. Table A–6 is a standard table, and for brevity, does not directly give all the information needed to use it. The orientation of the area principal axes and the values of I2–2, I3–3, and I4–4are not given because they can be determined as follows. Since the legs are equal, the principal axes are oriented ±45°from axis 1–1, and I2–2 /H11005I1–1. The second-area moment I3–3 is given by I3−3=A(k3−3)2(a) where k3–3is called the radius of gyration . The sum of the second-area moments for a cross section is invariant, so I1–1 /H11001I2–2 /H11005I3–3 /H11001I4–4. Thus, I4–4 is given by I4−4=2I1−1−I3−3 (b) where I2–2 /H11005I1–1. For example, consider a 3 /H110033 /H110031 4angle. Using Table A–6 and Eqs.

It is only occasion- ally that we encounter beams subjected to pure bending, that is to say, beams having zero shear force. The ﬂexure formula is developed on the assumption of pure bending. This is done, however, to eliminate the complicating effects of shear force in the devel- opment. For engineering purposes, the ﬂexure formula is valid no matter whether a shear force is present or not. For this reason, we shall utilize the same normal bending- stress distribution [Eqs. (3–24) and (3–26)] when shear forces are also present. In Fig. 3–17 awe show a beam segment of constant cross section subjected to a shear force Vand a bending moment Mat x.Because of external loading and V, the shear force and bending moment change with respect to x.At x+dxthe shear force and bending moment are V+dVand M+dM, respectively. Considering forces in the xdirection only, Fig. 3–17 bshows the stress distribution σxdue to the bending moments. If dMis positive, with the bending moment increasing, the stresses on the right face, for a given value of y, are larger in magnitude than the stresses on the left face. If we further isolate the element by making a slice at y=y1(see Fig. 3–17 b), the net force in the xdirection will be directed to the left with a value of /integraldisplayc y1(dM)y IdA as shown in the rotated view of Fig. 3–17 c. For equilibrium, a shear force on the bottom face, directed to the right, is required. This shear force gives rise to a shear stress τ, where, if assumed uniform, the force is τbd x . Thus τbd x=/integraldisplayc y1(dM)y IdA (a) The term dM/I can be removed from within the integral and b dx placed on the right side of the equation; then, from Eq. (3–3) with V=dM/dx, Eq. ( a) becomes τ=V Ib/integraldisplayc y1ydA (3–29) In this equation, the integral is the ﬁrst moment of the area A/primewith respect to the neu- tral axis (see Fig. 3–17 c). This integral is usually designated as Q. Thus Q=/integraldisplayc y1ydA=¯y/primeA/prime(3–30)bud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:01PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Load and Stress Analysis 95 where, for the isolated area y1to c, ¯y/primeis the distance in the ydirection from the neutral plane to the centroid of the area A/prime. With this, Eq. (3–29) can be written as τ=VQ Ib(3–31) This stress is known as the transverse shear stress. It is always accompanied with bend- ing stress. In using this equation, note that bis the width of the section at y=y1. Also, Iis the second moment of area of the entire section about the neutral axis. Because cross shears are equal, and area A/primeis ﬁnite, the shear stress τgiven by Eq. (3–31) and shown on area A/primein Fig. 3–17 coccurs only at y=y1. The shear stress on the lateral area varies with y, normally maximum at y=0(where ¯y/primeA/primeis maximum) and zero at the outer ﬁbers of the beam where A/prime/H110050. The shear stress distribution in a beam depends on how Q/bvaries as a function of y1. Here we will show how to determine the shear stress distribution for a beam with a rectangular cross section and provide results of maximum values of shear stress for other standard cross sections. Figure 3–18 shows a portion of a beam with a rectangu- lar cross section, subjected to a shear force Vand a bending moment M. As a result of the bending moment, a normal stress σis developed on a cross section such as A–A, which is in compression above the neutral axis and in tension below. To investigate the shear stress at a distance y1above the neutral axis, we select an element of area dAat a distance yabove the neutral axis. Then, dA=bdy,and so Eq. (3–30) becomes Q=/integraldisplayc y1ydA=b/integraldisplayc y1ydy=by2 2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglec y1=b 2/parenleftbig c2−y2 1/parenrightbig (b) Substituting this value for Qinto Eq.

(3–32) and rearrange, we get τ=3V 2A/parenleftbigg 1−y2 1 c2/parenrightbigg (3–33) We note that the maximum shear stress exists when y1=0, which is at the bending neu- tral axis. Thus τmax=3V 2A(3–34) for a rectangular section. As we move away from the neutral axis, the shear stress decreases parabolically until it is zero at the outer surfaces where y1=±c, as shown in Fig. 3–18 c. Horizontal shear stress is always accompanied by vertical shear stress of the same magnitude, and so the distribution can be diagrammed as shown in Fig. 3–18 d. Figure 3–18 cshows that the shear τon the vertical surfaces varies with y. We are almost always interested in the horizontal shear, τin Fig. 3–18 d, which is nearly uniform over dxwith constant y /H11005y1. The maximum horizontal shear occurs where the vertical shear is largest. This is usually at the neutral axis but may not be if the width bis smaller somewhere else. Furthermore, if the section is such that b can be minimized on a plane not horizontal, then the horizontal shear stress occurs on an inclined plane. For example, with tubing, the horizontal shear stress occurs on a radial plane and the corresponding “vertical shear” is not vertical, but tangential. The distributions of transverse shear stresses for several commonly used cross sec- tions are shown in Table 3–2. The proﬁles represent the VQ/Ib relationship, which is a function of the distance yfrom the neutral axis. For each proﬁle, the formula for the maximum value at the neutral axis is given. Note that the expression given for the I beam is a commonly used approximation that is reasonable for a standard I beam with a thin web. Also, the proﬁle for the I beam is idealized. In reality the transition from the web to the ﬂange is quite complex locally, and not simply a step change.Figure 3–18 Transverse shear stresses in a rectangular beam.b dA c/H9270max =3V 2Ay x hyy1 OVMy A A (a) (d)(b)( c)xzdyy /H9268 cy y1x/H9270 /H9270O dxbud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:01PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Load and Stress Analysis 97 It is signiﬁcant to observe that the transverse shear stress in each of these common cross sections is maximum on the neutral axis, and zero on the outer surfaces. Since this is exactly the opposite of where the bending and torsional stresses have their maximum and minimum values, the transverse shear stress is often not critical from a design perspective. Let us examine the signiﬁcance of the transverse shear stress, using as an example a cantilever beam of length L, with rectangular cross section b/H11003h, loaded at the free end with a transverse force F. At the wall, where the bending moment is the largest, at a dis- tance yfrom the neutral axis, a stress element will include both bending stress and transverse shear stress. In Sec. 5–4 it will be shown that a good measure of the com- bined effects of multiple stresses on a stress element is the maximum shear stress. Inserting the bending stress ( My/I) and the transverse shear stress ( VQ/Ib) into the maximum shear stress equation, Eq. (3–14), we obtain a general equation for the max- imum shear stress in a cantilever beam with a rectangular cross section. This equation can then be normalized with respect to L/hand y/c, where cis the distance from the neutral axis to the outer surface ( h/2), to give τmax=/radicalbigg/parenleftBigσ 2/parenrightBig2 +τ2=3F 2bh/radicalBig 4(L/h)2(y/c)2+/bracketleftbig 1−(y/c)2/bracketrightbig2(d) To investigate the signiﬁcance of transverse shear stress, we plot τmaxas a function of L/hfor several values of y/c, as shown in Fig. 3–19. Since F and bappear only as linear multipliers outside the radical, they will only serve to scale the plot in the verti- cal direction without changing any of the relationships. Notice that at the neutral axis where y/c/H110050, τmaxis constant for any length beam, since the bending stress is zero at the neutral axis and the transverse shear stress is independent of L. On the other hand, on the outer surface where y/c/H110051, τmaxincreases linearly with L/hbecause of the bending moment. For y/cbetween zero and one, τmaxis nonlinear for low values of L/h, but behaves linearly as L/h increases, displaying the dominance of the bending stress as the moment arm increases. We can see from the graph that the critical stress element (the largest value of τmax) will always be either on the outer surface ( y/c/H110051) or at the neutral axis ( y/c/H110050), and never between. Thus, for the rectangular cross section, the transition between these two locations occurs at L/h/H110050.5 where the line for y/c/H110051 crosses the horizontal line for y/c/H110050. The critical stress element is either on the outerTable 3–2 Formulas for Maximum Transverse Shear Stress from VQ/IbBeam Shape Formula Beam Shape Formula Rectan gular/H9270avc =V A Circ ular/H9270avc =V AHollo w, thin- walled ro und/H9270avc =V A /H9270max=3V 2A /H9270max=4V 3A/H9270max=2V A /H9270max.=V Aweb Structural I beam (thin-walled)Aweb bud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 12/02/2009 4:14 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:98 Mechanical Engineering Design surface where the transverse shear is zero, or if L/h is small enough, it is on the neutral axis where the bending stress is zero. The conclusions drawn from Fig. 3–19 are generally similar for any cross section that does not increase in width farther away from the neutral axis. This notably includes solid round cross sections, but not I beams or channels. Care must be taken with I beams and channels that have thin webs that extend far enough from the neutral axis that the bending and shear may both be signiﬁcant on the same stress element (See Ex. 3–7). For any common cross section beam, if the beam length to height ratio is greater than 10, the transverse shear stress is generally considered negligible compared to the bending stress at any point within the cross section. EXAMPLE 3–7 A beam 12 in long is to support a load of 488 lbf acting 3 in from the left support, as shown in Fig. 3–20 a. The beam is an I beam with the cross-sectional dimensions shown. To simplify the calculations, assume a cross section with square corners, as shown in Fig. 3–20 c. Points of interest are labeled ( a,b,c, and d) at distances yfrom the neutral axis of 0 in, 1.240/H11002in, 1.240/H11001in, and 1.5 in (Fig. 3–20 c). At the critical axial location along the beam, ﬁnd the following information. (a) Determine the proﬁle of the distribution of the transverse shear stress, obtain- ing values at each of the points of interest. (b) Determine the bending stresses at the points of interest. (c) Determine the maximum shear stresses at the points of interest, and compare them. Solution First, we note that the transverse shear stress is not likely to be negligible in this case since the beam length to height ratio is much less than 10, and since the thin web and wide ﬂange will allow the transverse shear to be large. The loading, shear-force, and bending-moment diagrams are shown in Fig. 3–20 b. The critical axial location is at x/H110053/H11002where the shear force and the bending moment are both maximum. (a) We obtain the area moment of inertia Iby evaluating Ifor a solid 3.0-in /H110032.33-in rectangular area, and then subtracting the two rectangular areas that are not part of the cross section.

The next critical location is at point bin the web, where the thin web thickness dramatically increases the transverse shear stress compared to points c or d. These results are counterintuitive, since both points aand b turn out to be more critical than point d, even though the bending stress is maximum at point d. The thin web and wide ﬂange increase the impact of the transverse shear stress. If the beam length to height ratio were increased, the critical point would move from point ato point b, since the transverse shear stress at point awould remain constant, but the bending stress at point bwould increase. The designer should be particularly alert to the possibility of the critical stress element not being on the outer surface with cross sections that get wider farther from the neutral axis, particularly in cases with thin web sections and wide ﬂanges. For rectangular and circular cross sections, how- ever, the maximum bending stresses at the outer surfaces will dominate, as was shown in Fig. 3–19.bud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:01PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Load and Stress Analysis 101 3–12 Torsion Any moment vector that is collinear with an axis of a mechanical element is called a torque vector, because the moment causes the element to be twisted about that axis. A bar subjected to such a moment is also said to be in torsion . As shown in Fig. 3–21, the torque Tapplied to a bar can be designated by drawing arrows on the surface of the bar to indicate direction or by drawing torque-vector arrows along the axes of twist of the bar. Torque vectors are the hollow arrows shown on the xaxis in Fig. 3–21. Note that they conform to the right-hand rule for vectors. The angle of twist, in radians, for a solid round bar is θ=Tl GJ(3–35) where T=torque l=length G=modulus of rigidity J=polar second moment of area Shear stresses develop throughout the cross section. For a round bar in torsion, these stresses are proportional to the radius ρand are given by τ=Tρ J(3–36) Designating ras the radius to the outer surface, we have τmax=Tr J(3–37) The assumptions used in the analysis are: •The bar is acted upon by a pure torque, and the sections under consideration are remote from the point of application of the load and from a change in diameter. •The material obeys Hooke’s law. •Adjacent cross sections originally plane and parallel remain plane and parallel after twisting, and any radial line remains straight.

Consequently, Eqs. (3–35) through (3–37) apply only to circular sections. For a solid round section, J=πd4 32(3–38) where dis the diameter of the bar. For a hollow round section, J=π 32/parenleftbig d4 o−d4 i/parenrightbig (3–39) where the subscripts oand irefer to the outside and inside diameters, respectively. There are some applications in machinery for noncircular cross section members and shafts where a regular polygonal cross section is useful in transmitting torque to a gear or pulley that can have an axial change in position. Because no key or keyway is needed, the possibility of a lost key is avoided. The development of equations for stress and deﬂection for torsional loading of noncircular cross sections can be obtained from the mathematical theory of elasticity. In general, the shear stress does not vary linearly with the distance from the axis, and depends on the speciﬁc cross section. In fact, for a rectangular section bar the shear stress is zero at the corners where the distance from the axis is the largest. The maximum shearing stress in a rectangular b×csection bar occurs in the middle of the longest side band is of the magnitude τmax=T αbc2.=T bc2/parenleftbigg 3+1.8 b/c/parenrightbigg (3–40) where bis the width (longer side) and cis the thickness (shorter side). They can notbe interchanged. The parameter αis a factor that is a function of the ratio b/cas shown in the following table.5The angle of twist is given by θ=Tl βbc3G(3–41) where βis a function of b/c, as shown in the table. b/c 1.00 1.50 1.75 2.00 2.50 3.00 4.00 6.00 8.00 10 ∞ α 0.208 0.231 0.239 0.246 0.258 0.267 0.282 0.299 0.307 0.313 0.333 β 0.141 0.196 0.214 0.228 0.249 0.263 0.281 0.299 0.307 0.313 0.333 Equation (3–40) is also approximately valid for equal-sided angles; these can be con- sidered as two rectangles, each of which is capable of carrying half the torque.6 It is often necessary to obtain the torque Tfrom a consideration of the power and speed of a rotating shaft.

Open Thin-Walled Sections When the median wall line is not closed, the section is said to be an open section . Fig- ure 3–27 presents some examples. Open sections in torsion, where the wall is thin, have relations derived from the membrane analogy theory8resulting in: τ=Gθ1c=3T Lc2(3–47) where τis the shear stress, Gis the shear modulus, θ1is the angle of twist per unit length, Tis torque, and Lis the length of the median line. The wall thickness is designated c(rather than t) to remind you that you are in open sections. By study- ing the table that follows Eq. (3–41) you will discover that membrane theory pre- sumes b/c→∞ . Note that open thin-walled sections in torsion should be avoided in design. As indicated in Eq. (3–47), the shear stress and the angle of twist are inversely proportional to c2and c3,respectively. Thus, for small wall thickness, stress and twist can become quite large. For example, consider the thin round tube with a slit in Fig. 3–27. For a ratio of wall thickness of outside diameter of c/do=0.1,the open section has greater magnitudes of stress and angle of twist by factors of 12.3 and 61.5, respectively, compared to a closed section of the same dimensions. 8See S.

But it is quite difﬁcult to design a machine without permitting some changes in the cross sections of the members. Rotating shafts must have shoulders designed on them so that the bearings can be properly seated and so that they will take thrust loads; and the shafts must have key slots machined into them for securing pul- leys and gears. A bolt has a head on one end and screw threads on the other end, both of which account for abrupt changes in the cross section. Other parts require holes, oil grooves, and notches of various kinds. Any discontinuity in a machine part alters the stress distribution in the neighborhood of the discontinuity so that the elementary stress equations no longer describe the state of stress in the part at these locations. Such dis- continuities are called stress raisers, and the regions in which they occur are called areas of stress concentration . Stress concentrations can also arise from some irregular- ity not inherent in the member, such as tool marks, holes, notches, grooves, or threads. 1 inT 1 8in Figure 3–28 The cross-section of a thin strip of steel subjected to a torsional moment T.bud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:02PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Load and Stress Analysis 111 A theoretical, or geometric, stress-concentration factor K tor Ktsis used to relate the actual maximum stress at the discontinuity to the nominal stress. The factors are deﬁned by the equations Kt=σmax σ0Kts=τmax τ0(3–48) where Ktis used for normal stresses and Ktsfor shear stresses. The nominal stress σ0or τ0is the stress calculated by using the elementary stress equations and the net area, or net cross section. Sometimes the gross cross section is used instead, and so it is always wise to double check the source of Ktor Ktsbefore calculating the maximum stress. The stress-concentration factor depends for its value only on the geometry of the part. That is, the particular material used has no effect on the value of Kt. This is why it is called a theoretical stress-concentration factor. The analysis of geometric shapes to determine stress-concentration factors is a difﬁcult problem, and not many solutions can be found. Most stress-concentration factors are found by using experimental techniques.9Though the ﬁnite-element method has been used, the fact that the elements are indeed ﬁnite prevents ﬁnding the true maximum stress. Experimental approaches generally used include photoelasticity, grid methods, brittle-coating methods, and electrical strain-gauge methods. Of course, the grid and strain-gauge methods both suffer from the same drawback as the ﬁnite- element method. Stress-concentration factors for a variety of geometries may be found in Tables A–15 and A–16. An example is shown in Fig. 3–29, that of a thin plate loaded in tension where the plate contains a centrally located hole. Instatic loading, stress-concentration factors are applied as follows. In ductile materials (/epsilon1f≥0.05), the stress-concentration factor is not usually applied to predict the critical stress, because plastic strain in the region of the stress is localized and has a strengthening effect. In brittle materials (/epsilon1f<0.05), the geometric stress- concentration factor Ktis applied to the nominal stress before comparing it with strength. Gray cast iron has so many inherent stress raisers that the stress raisers intro- duced by the designer have only a modest (but additive) effect. 9The best source book is W. D. Pilkey and D. F.

The yielding will be restricted to a very small region, and the permanent deformation as well as the residual stresses after the load is released will be insigniﬁ- cant and normally can be tolerated. If yielding does occur, the stress distribution changes and tends toward a more uniform distribution. In the region where yielding occurs, there is little danger of fracture of a ductile material, but if the possibility of a brittle fracture exists, the stress concentration must be taken seriously. Brittle fracture is not just limited to brittle materials. Materials often thought of as being ductile can fail in a brittle manner under certain conditions, e.g., any single application or combi- nation of cyclic loading, rapid application of static loads, loading at low temperatures, and parts containing defects in their material structures (see Sec. 5–12). The effects on a ductile material of processing, such as hardening, hydrogen embrittlement, and welding, may also accelerate failure. Thus, care should always be exercised when deal- ing with stress concentrations. For dynamic loading, the stress concentration effect is signiﬁcant for both ductile and brittle materials and must always be taken into account (see Sec. 6–10). EXAMPLE 3–13 The 2-mm-thick bar shown in Fig. 3–30 is loaded axially with a constant force of 10 kN. The bar material has been heat treated and quenched to raise its strength, but as a con- sequence it has lost most of its ductility. It is desired to drill a hole through the center of the 40-mm face of the plate to allow a cable to pass through it. A 4-mm hole is suf- ﬁcient for the cable to ﬁt, but an 8-mm drill is readily available. Will a crack be more likely to initiate at the larger hole, the smaller hole, or at the ﬁllet? Solution Since the material is brittle, the effect of stress concentrations near the discontinuities must be considered. Dealing with the hole ﬁrst, for a 4-mm hole, the nominal stress is σ0=F A=F (w−d)t=10 000 (40−4)2=139 MPa The theoretical stress concentration factor, from Fig. A–15–1, with d/w/H110054/40 /H110050.1, is Kt/H110052.7. The maximum stress is Answer σmax=Ktσ0=2.7(139)=380 MPa Similarly, for an 8-mm hole, σ0=F A=F (w−d)t=10 000 (40−8)2=156 MPa With d/w=8/40=0.2,then Kt/H110052.5, and the maximum stress is Figure 3–30 40 mm 34 mm1 mm rad 10 kNbud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/25/09 4:55PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Load and Stress Analysis 113 Answer σmax=Ktσ0=2.5(156)=390 MPa Though the stress concentration is higher with the 4-mm hole, in this case the increased nominal stress with the 8-mm hole has more effect on the maximum stress. For the ﬁllet, σ0=F A=10 000 (34)2=147 MPa From Table A–15–5, D/d=40/34=1.18, and r/d=1/34 =0.026. Then Kt=2.5. Answer σmax=Ktσ0=2.5(147)=368 MPa Answer The crack will most likely occur with the 8-mm hole, next likely would be the 4-mm hole, and least likely at the ﬁllet. 3–14 Stresses in Pressurized Cylinders Cylindrical pressure vessels, hydraulic cylinders, gun barrels, and pipes carrying ﬂuids at high pressures develop both radial and tangential stresses with values that depend upon the radius of the element under consideration. In determining the radial stress σr and the tangential stress σt, we make use of the assumption that the longitudinal elongation is constant around the circumference of the cylinder. In other words, a right section of the cylinder remains plane after stressing. Referring to Fig. 3–31, we designate the inside radius of the cylinder by ri, the out- side radius by ro, the internal pressure by pi, and the external pressure by po. Then it can be shown that tangential and radial stresses exist whose magnitudes are10 σt=pir2 i−por2 o−r2 ir2 o(po−pi)/r2 r2o−r2 i (3–49) σr=pir2 i−por2 o+r2 ir2 o(po−pi)/r2 r2o−r2 i As usual, positive values indicate tension and negative values, compression. For the special case of po=0, Eq. (3–49) gives σt=r2 ipi r2o−r2 i/parenleftbigg 1+r2 o r2/parenrightbigg (3–50) σr=r2 ipi r2o−r2 i/parenleftbigg 1−r2 o r2/parenrightbigg 10See Richard G.

It should be realized that longitudinal stresses exist when the end reactions to the internal pressure are taken by the pressure vessel itself. This stress is found to be σl=pir2 i r2o−r2 i(3–51) We further note that Eqs. (3–49), (3–50), and (3–51) apply only to sections taken a sig- niﬁcant distance from the ends and away from any areas of stress concentration. Thin-Walled Vessels When the wall thickness of a cylindrical pressure vessel is about one-tenth, or less, of its radius, the radial stress that results from pressurizing the vessel is quite small com- pared with the tangential stress. Under these conditions the tangential stress can be obtained as follows: Let an internal pressure pbe exerted on the wall of a cylinder of thickness tand inside diameter di. The force tending to separate two halves of a unit length of the cylinder is pdi.This force is resisted by the tangential stress, also called the hoop stress, acting uniformly over the stressed area. We then have pdi=2tσt,or (σt)av=pdi 2t(3–52) This equation gives the average tangential stress and is valid regardless of the wall thick- ness. For a thin-walled vessel an approximation to the maximum tangential stress is (σt)max=p(di+t) 2t(3–53) where di+tis the average diameter. In a closed cylinder, the longitudinal stress σlexists because of the pressure upon the ends of the vessel. If we assume this stress is also distributed uniformly over the wall thickness, we can easily ﬁnd it to be σl=pdi 4t(3–54) (a) Tangential stress distribution(b) Radial stress distributionroro pi pi/H9268t /H9268rpo = 0 po = 0 ririFigure 3–32 Distribution of stresses in a thick-walled cylinder subjected to internal pressure.bud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:02PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Load and Stress Analysis 115 EXAMPLE 3–14 An aluminum-alloy pressure vessel is made of tubing having an outside diameter of 8 in and a wall thickness of 1 4in. (a) What pressure can the cylinder carry if the permissible tangential stress is 12 kpsi and the theory for thin-walled vessels is assumed to apply? (b) On the basis of the pressure found in part ( a), compute the stress components using the theory for thick-walled cylinders. Solution (a) Here di=8−2(0.25)=7.5in, ri=7.5/2=3.75in, and ro=8/2=4in. Then t/ri=0.25/3.75=0.067. Since this ratio is less than 0.1, the theory for thin-walled vessels should yield safe results. We ﬁrst solve Eq. (3–53) to obtain the allowable pressure. This gives Answer p=2t(σt)max di+t=2(0.25)(12)(10)3 7.5+0.25=774 psi (b) The maximum tangential stress will occur at the inside radius, and so we use r=riin the ﬁrst equation of Eq. (3–50). This gives Answer (σt)max=r2 ipi r2o−r2 i/parenleftbigg 1+r2 o r2 i/parenrightbigg =pir2 o+r2 i r2o−r2 i=77442+3.752 42−3.752=12 000 psi Similarly, the maximum radial stress is found, from the second equation of Eq. (3–50) to be Answer σr=− pi=−774 psi The stresses σtand σrare principal stresses, since there is no shear on these surfaces. Note that there is no signiﬁcant difference in the stresses in parts ( a) and ( b), and so the thin-wall theory can be considered satisfactory for this problem. 3–15 Stresses in Rotating Rings Many rotating elements, such as ﬂywheels and blowers, can be simpliﬁed to a rotating ring to determine the stresses. When this is done it is found that the same tangential and radial stresses exist as in the theory for thick-walled cylinders except that they are caused by inertial forces acting on all the particles of the ring. The tangential and radial stresses so found are subject to the following restrictions: •The outside radius of the ring, or disk, is large compared with the thickness ro≥10t. •The thickness of the ring or disk is constant. •The stresses are constant over the thickness. The stresses are11 σt=ρω2/parenleftbigg3+ν 8/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg r2 i+r2 o+r2 ir2 o r2−1+3ν 3+νr2/parenrightbigg (3–55) σr=ρω2/parenleftbigg3+ν 8/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg r2 i+r2 o−r2 ir2 o r2−r2/parenrightbigg 11Ibid, pp. 348–357.bud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:02PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:116 Mechanical Engineering Design where ris the radius to the stress element under consideration, ρis the mass density, and ωis the angular velocity of the ring in radians per second. For a rotating disk, use ri=0in these equations. 3–16 Press and Shrink Fits When two cylindrical parts are assembled by shrinking or press ﬁtting one part upon another, a contact pressure is created between the two parts. The stresses resulting from this pressure may easily be determined with the equations of the preceding sections. Figure 3–33 shows two cylindrical members that have been assembled with a shrink ﬁt. Prior to assembly, the outer radius of the inner member was larger than the inner radius of the outer member by the radial interference δ.. After assembly, an interference contact pressure pdevelops between the members at the nominal radius R, causing radial stresses σr=− pin each member at the contacting surfaces. This pressure is given by12 p=δ R/bracketleftbigg1 Eo/parenleftbiggr2 o+R2 r2o−R2+νo/parenrightbigg +1 Ei/parenleftbiggR2+r2 i R2−r2 i−νi/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg (3–56) where the subscripts oand i on the material properties correspond to the outer and inner members, respectively.

(3–56) or (3–57), diameters can be used in place of R, ri, and ro, provided δis the diametral interference (twice the radial interference). With p, Eq. (3–49) can be used to determine the radial and tangential stresses in each member. For the inner member, po=pand pi=0, For the outer member, po=0 and pi=p.

In the case of a hub that has been press-ﬁtted onto a shaft, this assumption would not be true, and there would be an increased pressure at each end of the hub. It is customary to allow for this condition by employing a stress-concentration factor. The value of this factor depends upon the contact pressure and the design of the female member, but its theoretical value is seldom greater than 2. 3–17 Temperature Effects When the temperature of an unrestrained body is uniformly increased, the body expands, and the normal strain is /epsilon1x=/epsilon1y=/epsilon1z=α(/Delta1T) (3–60) where αis the coefﬁcient of thermal expansion and /Delta1Tis the temperature change, in degrees. In this action the body experiences a simple volume increase with the compo- nents of shear strain all zero. If a straight bar is restrained at the ends so as to prevent lengthwise expansion and then is subjected to a uniform increase in temperature, a compressive stress will develop because of the axial constraint. The stress is σ=−/epsilon1E=−α(/Delta1T)E (3–61) In a similar manner, if a uniform ﬂat plate is restrained at the edges and also sub- jected to a uniform temperature rise, the compressive stress developed is given by the equation σ=−α(/Delta1T)E 1−ν(3–62) The stresses expressed by Eqs. (3–61) and (3–62) are called thermal stresses . They arise because of a temperature change in a clamped or restrained member. Such stresses, for example, occur during welding, since parts to be welded must be clamped before welding. Table 3–3 lists approximate values of the coefﬁcients of thermal expansion.

We shall find that the neutral axis and the centroidal axis of a curved beam, unlike the axes of a straight beam, are not coincident and also that the stress does not vary linearly from the neutral axis. The notation shown in Fig. 3–34 is defined as follows: ro=radius of outer ﬁber ri=radius of inner ﬁber h=depth of section co=distance from neutral axis to outer ﬁber ci=distance from neutral axis to inner ﬁber rn=radius of neutral axis rc=radius of centroidal axis e=distance from centroidal axis to neutral axis M=bending moment; positive Mdecreases curvature Figure 3–34 shows that the neutral and centroidal axes are not coincident.

The stress distribution given by Eq. (3–64) is hyperbolic and not linear as is the case for straight beams. The critical stresses occur at the inner and outer surfaces where y =ciand y =/H11002co, respectively, and are σi=Mc i Aer iσo=−Mc o Aer o(3–65) These equations are valid for pure bending. In the usual and more general case, such as a crane hook, the U frame of a press, or the frame of a C clamp, the bending moment is due to a force acting at a distance from the cross section under consideration. Thus, the cross section transmits a bending moment andan axial force. The axial force is located at the centroidal axis of the section and the bending moment is then computed at this location. The tensile or compressive stress due to the axial force, from Eq. (3–22), is then added to the bending stresses given by Eqs. (3–64) and (3–65) to obtain the resultant stresses acting on the section. EXAMPLE 3–15 Plot the distribution of stresses across section A–Aof the crane hook shown in Fig. 3–35 a. The cross section is rectangular, with b=0.75in and h=4in, and the load is F=5000 lbf. Solution Since A=bh, we have dA=bd r and, from Eq. (3–63), rn=A/integraldisplaydA r=bh/integraldisplayro rib rdr=h lnro ri(1) From Fig. 3–35 b, we see that ri=2in, ro=6in, rc=4in, and A=3in2. Thus, from Eq.

(3–64) gives σ=F A+My Ae(rn−y)=5000 3+(20 000 )(3.641−r) 3(0.359)r(2) Substituting values of rfrom 2 to 6 in results in the stress distribution shown in Fig. 3–35 c. The stresses at the inner and outer radii are found to be 16.9 and −5.63kpsi, respectively, as shown.bud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 12/31/09 3:12 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:120 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 3–35 (a) Plan view of crane hook; (b) cross section and notation; (c) resulting stress distribution. There is no stress concentration. Note in the hook example, the symmetrical rectangular cross section causes the maximum tensile stress to be 3 times greater than the maximum compressive stress. If we wanted to design the hook to use material more effectively we would use more material at the inner radius and less material at the outer radius. For this reason, trape- zoidal, T, or unsymmetric I, cross sections are commonly used. Sections most fre- quently encountered in the stress analysis of curved beams are shown in Table 3–4. Alternative Calculations for e Calculating rnand rcmathematically and subtracting the difference can lead to large errors if not done carefully, since rnand rcare typically large values compared to e. Since eis in the denominator of Eqs. (3–64) and (3–65), a large error in ecan lead to an inaccurate stress calculation. Furthermore, if you have a complex cross section that the tables do not handle, alternative methods for determining eare needed. For a quick and simple approximation of e, it can be shown that14 e.=I rcA(3–66)rc rn ye 2 inr 6 in4 in (a) /H9268 23+ –456r16.9 kpsi –5.63 kpsiSection A–A (b) (c)2-in R.A A F6-in R. 0.75 in 14Ibid., pp. 317–321.

(3–67) becomes the straight-beam formulation, Eq. (3–24). Note that the negative sign is missing because y in Fig. 3–34 is vertically downward, opposite that for the straight-beam equation.

Contact-stress problems arise in the contact of a wheel and a rail, in auto- motive valve cams and tappets, in mating gear teeth, and in the action of rolling bearings. Typical failures are seen as cracks, pits, or ﬂaking in the surface material. The most general case of contact stress occurs when each contacting body has a double radius of curvature; that is, when the radius in the plane of rolling is different from the radius in a perpendicular plane, both planes taken through the axis of the con- tacting force. Here we shall consider only the two special cases of contacting spheres and contacting cylinders.15The results presented here are due to Hertz and so are fre- quently known as Hertzian stresses . 15A more comprehensive presentation of contact stresses may be found in Arthur P. Boresi and Richard J. Schmidt, Advanced Mechanics of Materials, 6th ed., Wiley, New York, 2003, pp. 589–623.bud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:02PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Load and Stress Analysis 123 Spherical Contact When two solid spheres of diameters d1and d2are pressed together with a force F, a circular area of contact of radius ais obtained.

The maximum pressure occurs at the center of the contact area and is pmax=3F 2πa2(3–69) Equations (3–68) and (3–69) are perfectly general and also apply to the contact of a sphere and a plane surface or of a sphere and an internal spherical surface. For a plane surface, use d=∞ . For an internal surface, the diameter is expressed as a negative quantity. The maximum stresses occur on the zaxis, and these are principal stresses.

The equations are even more com- plicated when stress states off the zaxis are to be determined, because here the xandy coordinates must also be included. But these are not required for design purposes, because the maxima occur on the zaxis. Mohr’s circles for the stress state described by Eqs. (3–70) and (3–71) are a point and two coincident circles. Since σ1=σ2,we have τ1/2=0and τmax=τ1/3=τ2/3=σ1−σ3 2=σ2−σ3 2(3–72) Figure 3–37 is a plot of Eqs. (3–70), (3–71), and (3–72) for a distance to 3abelow the surface. Note that the shear stress reaches a maximum value slightly below the surface. It is the opinion of many authorities that this maximum shear stress is responsible for the surface fatigue failure of contacting elements. The explanation is that a crack orig- inates at the point of maximum shear stress below the surface and progresses to the sur- face and that the pressure of the lubricant wedges the chip loose. Cylindrical Contact Figure 3–38 illustrates a similar situation in which the contacting elements are two cylinders of length land diameters d1andd2. As shown in Fig. 3–38 b, the area of con- tact is a narrow rectangle of width 2band length l, and the pressure distribution is elliptical.

Hertz (1881) provided the preceding mathematical models of the stress ﬁeld when the contact zone is free of shear stress. Another important contact stress case is line of contact with friction providing the shearing stress on the contact zone. Such shearing stresses are small with cams and rollers, but in cams with ﬂatfaced followers, wheel-rail contact, and gear teeth, the stresses are elevated above the Hertzian ﬁeld. Investigations of the effect on the stress ﬁeld due to normal and shear stresses in the contact zone were begun theoretically by Lundberg (1939), and continued by Mindlin (1949), Smith-Liu (1949), and Poritsky (1949) independently.

Why? Whether the member fails or not is assessed by comparing the (damaging) stress at a critical location with the corresponding mate- rial strength at this location. This chapter has addressed the description of stress. Stresses can be estimated with great precision where the geometry is sufﬁciently simple that theory easily provides the necessary quantitative relationships. In other cases, approximations are used. There are numerical approximations such as ﬁnite element analysis (FEA, see Chap. 19), whose results tend to converge on the true val- ues. There are experimental measurements, strain gauging, for example, allowing infer- ence of stresses from the measured strain conditions. Whatever the method(s), the goal is a robust description of the stress condition at a critical location. The nature of research results and understanding in any ﬁeld is that the longer we work on it, the more involved things seem to be, and new approaches are sought to help with the complications. As newer schemes are introduced, engineers, hungry for the improvement the new approach promises, begin to use the approach. Optimism usually recedes, as further experience adds concerns. Tasks that promised to extend the capabilities of the nonexpert eventually show that expertise is not optional. In stress analysis, the computer can be helpful if the necessary equations are available. Spreadsheet analysis can quickly reduce complicated calculations for parametric studies, easily handling “what if ” questions relating trade-offs (e.g., less of a costly material or more of a cheaper material). It can even give insight into optimization opportunities. When the necessary equations are not available, then methods such as FEA are attractive, but cautions are in order. Even when you have access to a powerful FEA code, you should be near an expert while you are learning. There are nagging questions of convergence at discontinuities. Elastic analysis is much easier than elastic-plastic analysis. The results are no better than the modeling of reality that was used to formulate the problem. Chapter 19 provides an idea of what ﬁnite-element analysis is and how it can be used in design. The chapter is by no means comprehensive in ﬁnite-element the- ory and the application of ﬁnite elements in practice. Both skill sets require much expo- sure and experience to be adept.bud29281_ch03_071-146.qxd 11/24/09 3:02PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Load and Stress Analysis 127 PROBLEMS Problems marked with an asterisk (*) are linked with problems in other chapters, as summarized in Table 1–1 of Sec. 1–16, p. 24.

A body can be sufﬁ- ciently insensitive to deformation that a presumption of rigidity does not affect an analy- sis enough to warrant a nonrigid treatment. If the body deformation later proves to be not negligible, then declaring rigidity was a poor decision, not a poor assumption. A wire rope is ﬂexible, but in tension it can be robustly rigid and it distorts enormously under attempts at compressive loading. The same body can be both rigid and nonrigid. Deﬂection analysis enters into design situations in many ways. A snap ring, or retain- ing ring, must be ﬂexible enough to be bent without permanent deformation and assembled with other parts, and then it must be rigid enough to hold the assembled parts together. In a transmission, the gears must be supported by a rigid shaft. If the shaft bends too much, that is, if it is too ﬂexible, the teeth will not mesh properly, and the result will be excessive impact, noise, wear, and early failure. In rolling sheet or strip steel to pre- scribed thicknesses, the rolls must be crowned, that is, curved, so that the ﬁnished product will be of uniform thickness. Thus, to design the rolls it is necessary to know exactly how much they will bend when a sheet of steel is rolled between them. Sometimes mechanical elements must be designed to have a particular force-deﬂection characteristic. The suspension system of an automobile, for example, must be designed within a very narrow range to achieve an optimum vibration frequency for all conditions of vehicle loading, because the human body is comfortable only within a limited range of frequencies. The size of a load-bearing component is often determined on deﬂections, rather than limits on stress. This chapter considers distortion of single bodies due to geometry (shape) and loading, then, brieﬂy, the behavior of groups of bodies. 4–1 Spring Rates Elasticity is that property of a material that enables it to regain its original conﬁguration after having been deformed. A spring is a mechanical element that exerts a force when deformed. Figure 4–1 ashows a straight beam of length lsimply supported at the ends and loaded by the transverse force F. The deﬂection yis linearly related to the force, as long as the elastic limit of the material is not exceeded, as indicated by the graph. This beam can be described as a linear spring. In Fig. 4–1 ba straight beam is supported on two cylinders such that the length between supports decreases as the beam is deﬂected by the force F. A larger force is required to deﬂect a short beam than a long one, and hence the more this beam is deﬂected, the stiffer it becomes. Also, the force is not linearly related to the deﬂection, and hence this beam can be described as a nonlinear stiffening spring. Figure 4–1 cis an edge-view of a dish-shaped round disk. The force necessary to ﬂat- ten the disk increases at ﬁrst and then decreases as the disk approaches a ﬂat conﬁguration, Figure 4–1 (a) A linear spring; (b) a stiffening spring; (c) a softening spring.l F Fyl F yd F y (a)yF (b)yF (c)ybud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 12/10/2009 4:05 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Deﬂection and Stiffness 149 as shown by the graph. Any mechanical element having such a characteristic is called a nonlinear softening spring. If we designate the general relationship between force and deﬂection by the equation F=F(y) (a) then spring rate is deﬁned as k(y)=lim /Delta1y→0/Delta1F /Delta1y=dF dy(4–1) where ymust be measured in the direction of Fand at the point of application of F. Most of the force-deﬂection problems encountered in this book are linear, as in Fig. 4–1 a. For these, kis a constant, also called the spring constant; consequently Eq. (4–1) is written k=F y(4–2) We might note that Eqs. (4–1) and (4–2) are quite general and apply equally well for torques and moments, provided angular measurements are used for y. For linear dis- placements, the units of kare often pounds per inch or newtons per meter, and for angular displacements, pound-inches per radian or newton-meters per radian. 4–2 Tension, Compression, and Torsion The total extension or contraction of a uniform bar in pure tension or compression, respectively, is given by δ=Fl AE(4–3) This equation does not apply to a long bar loaded in compression if there is a possibil- ity of buckling (see Secs. 4–11 to 4–15). Using Eqs. (4–2) and (4–3) with δ=y, we see that the spring constant of an axially loaded bar is k=AE l(4–4) The angular deﬂection of a uniform solid or hollow round bar subjected to a twist- ing moment Twas given in Eq. (3–35), and is θ=Tl GJ(4–5) where θis in radians. If we multiply Eq. (4–5) by 180/πand substitute J=πd4/32for a solid round bar, we obtain θ=583.6Tl Gd4(4–6) where θis in degrees. Equation (4–5) can be rearranged to give the torsional spring rate as k=T θ=GJ l(4–7) Equations (4–5), (4–6), and (4–7) apply only to circular cross sections. Torsional load- ing for bars with noncircular cross sections is discussed in Sec. 3–12 (p. 101). For the angular twist of rectangular cross sections, closed thin-walled tubes, and open thin- walled sections, refer to Eqs. (3–41), (3–46), and (3–47), respectively.bud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/09 2:55PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:150 Mechanical Engineering Design 4–3 Deﬂection Due to Bending The problem of bending of beams probably occurs more often than any other loading problem in mechanical design. Shafts, axles, cranks, levers, springs, brackets, and wheels, as well as many other elements, must often be treated as beams in the design and analy- sis of mechanical structures and systems. The subject of bending, however, is one that you should have studied as preparation for reading this book. It is for this reason that we include here only a brief review to establish the nomenclature and conventions to be used throughout this book. The curvature of a beam subjected to a bending moment Mis given by 1 ρ=M EI(4–8) where ρis the radius of curvature. From studies in mathematics we also learn that the curvature of a plane curve is given by the equation 1 ρ=d2y/dx2 [1+(dy/dx)2]3/2(4–9) where the interpretation here is that yis the lateral deﬂection of the centroidal axis of the beam at any point xalong its length. The slope of the beam at any point xis θ=dy dx(a) For many problems in bending, the slope is very small, and for these the denominator of Eq. (4–9) can be taken as unity. Equation (4–8) can then be written M EI=d2y dx2(b) Noting Eqs. (3–3) and (3–4) and successively differentiating Eq. ( b) yields V EI=d3y dx3(c) q EI=d4y dx4(d) It is convenient to display these relations in a group as follows: q EI=d4y dx4(4–10) V EI=d3y dx3(4–11) M EI=d2y dx2(4–12) θ=dy dx(4–13) y=f(x) (4–14)bud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/09 2:55PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Deﬂection and Stiffness 151 The nomenclature and conventions are illustrated by the beam of Fig. 4–2. Here, a beam of length l=20in is loaded by the uniform load w=80lbf per inch of beam length. The xaxis is positive to the right, and the yaxis positive upward. All quantities— loading, shear, moment, slope, and deﬂection—have the same sense as y; they are pos- itive if upward, negative if downward. The reactions R1=R2=+800 lbf and the shear forces V0=+ 800 lbf and Vl=−800 lbf are easily computed by using the methods of Chap. 3. The bending moment is zero at each end because the beam is simply supported. For a simply- supported beam, the deﬂections are also zero at each end.

(4–12), determine the equations for the slope and deﬂection of the beam, the slopes at the ends, and the maximum deﬂection. Solution Integrating Eq. (4–12) as an indeﬁnite integral we have EIdy dx=/integraldisplay Md x=wl 4x2−w 6x3+C1 (1) where C1is a constant of integration that is evaluated from geometric boundary conditions. We could impose that the slope is zero at the midspan of the beam, since the beam andbud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/09 2:55PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:152 Mechanical Engineering Design loading are symmetric relative to the midspan. However, we will use the given bound- ary conditions of the problem and verify that the slope is zero at the midspan. Integrating Eq. (1) gives EIy=/integraldisplay/integraldisplay Md x=wl 12x3−w 24x4+C1x+C2 (2) The boundary conditions for the simply supported beam are y=0 at x=0 and l. Applying the ﬁrst condition, y=0 at x=0, to Eq. (2) results in C2=0. Applying the second condition to Eq. (2) with C2=0, EIy(l)=wl 12l3−w 24l4+C1l=0 Solving for C1yields C1=−wl3/24. Substituting the constants back into Eqs. (1) and (2) and solving for the deﬂection and slope results in y=wx 24EI(2lx2−x3−l3) (3) θ=dy dx=w 24EI(6lx2−4x3−l3) (4) Comparing Eq. (3) with that given in Table A–9, beam 7, we see complete agreement. For the slope at the left end, substituting x=0 into Eq. (4) yields θ|x=0=−wl3 24EI and at x=l, θ|x=l=wl3 24EI At the midspan, substituting x=l/2 gives dy/dx=0, as earlier suspected. The maximum deﬂection occurs where dy/dx=0. Substituting x=l/2 into Eq. (3) yields ymax=−5wl4 384EI which again agrees with Table A–9–7. The approach used in the example is ﬁne for simple beams with continuous loading. However, for beams with discontinuous loading and/or geometry such as a step shaft with multiple gears, ﬂywheels, pulleys, etc., the approach becomes unwieldy. The following section discusses bending deﬂections in general and the techniques that are provided in this chapter. 4–4 Beam Deﬂection Methods Equations (4–10) through (4–14) are the basis for relating the intensity of loading q, vertical shear V, bending moment M, slope of the neutral surface θ, and the trans- verse deflection y. Beams have intensities of loading that range from q=constantbud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/09 2:55PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Deﬂection and Stiffness 153 1Warren C.

The intensity of loading usually consists of piecewise contiguous zones, the expressions for which are integrated through Eqs. (4–10) to (4–14) with varying degrees of difﬁculty. Another approach is to represent the deﬂection y(x)as a Fourier series, which is capable of representing single-valued functions with a ﬁnite number of ﬁnite discontinuities, then differentiating through Eqs. (4–14) to (4–10), and stopping at some level where the Fourier coefﬁcients can be evaluated. A complication is the piecewise continuous nature of some beams (shafts) that are stepped-diameter bodies. All of the above constitute, in one form or another, formal integration methods, which, with properly selected problems, result in solutions for q, V, M, θ, and y. These solutions may be 1Closed-form, or 2Represented by inﬁnite series, which amount to closed form if the series are rapidly convergent, or 3Approximations obtained by evaluating the ﬁrst or the ﬁrst and second terms. The series solutions can be made equivalent to the closed-form solution by the use of a computer. Roark’s1formulas are committed to commercial software and can be used on a personal computer. There are many techniques employed to solve the integration problem for beam deﬂection. Some of the popular methods include: •Superposition (see Sec. 4–5) •The moment-area method2 •Singularity functions (see Sec. 4–6) •Numerical integration3 The two methods described in this chapter are easy to implement and can handle a large array of problems. There are methods that do not deal with Eqs. (4–10) to (4–14) directly. An energy method, based on Castigliano’s theorem, is quite powerful for problems not suitable for the methods mentioned earlier and is discussed in Secs. 4–7 to 4–10. Finite element programs are also quite useful for determining beam deﬂections. 4–5 Beam Deﬂections by Superposition The results of many simple load cases and boundary conditions have been solved and are available. Table A–9 provides a limited number of cases. Roark’s4provides a much more comprehensive listing. Superposition resolves the effect of combined loading on a structure by determining the effects of each load separately and addingbud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/09 2:55PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:154 Mechanical Engineering Design the results algebraically. Superposition may be applied provided: (1) each effect is linearly related to the load that produces it, (2) a load does not create a condition that affects the result of another load, and (3) the deformations resulting from any spe- cific load are not large enough to appreciably alter the geometric relations of the parts of the structural system. The following examples are illustrations of the use of superposition. Figure 4–3 xy R1F wa bl BAC R2 If the maximum deﬂection of a beam is desired, it will occur either where the slope is zero or at the end of the overhang if the beam has a free end. In the previous example, there is no overhang, so setting dy/dx=0will yield the equation for xthat locates where the maximum deﬂection occurs. In the example there are two equations for y where only one will yield a solution. If a=l/2, the maximum deﬂection would obvi- ously occur at x=l/2because of symmetry. However, if a<l/2, where would the maximum deﬂection occur? It can be shown that as Fmoves toward the left support, the maximum deﬂection moves toward the left support also, but not as much as F(see Prob. 4–34). Thus, we would set dyBC/dx=0and solve for x. If a>l/2, then we would set dyAB/H20862dx=0. For more complicated problems, plotting the equations using numerical data is the simplest approach to ﬁnding the maximum deﬂection.EXAMPLE 4–2 Consider the uniformly loaded beam with a concentrated force as shown in Fig. 4–3. Using superposition, determine the reactions and the deﬂection as a function of x. Solution Considering each load state separately, we can superpose beams 6 and 7 of Table A–9. For the reactions we ﬁnd Answer R1=Fb l+wl 2 Answer R2=Fa l+wl 2 The loading of beam 6 is discontinuous and separate deﬂection equations are given for regions ABand BC.Beam 7 loading is not discontinuous so there is only one equa- tion.

EXAMPLE 4–4 Figure 4–5 ashows a cantilever beam with an end load. Normally we model this prob- lem by considering the left support as rigid. After testing the rigidity of the wall it was found that the translational stiffness of the wall was ktforce per unit vertical deﬂection, and the rotational stiffness was krmoment per unit angular (radian) deﬂection (see Fig. 4–5 b). Determine the deﬂection equation for the beam under the load F.Sometimes it may not be obvious that we can use superposition with the tables at hand, as demonstrated in the next example.bud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/09 2:55PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:156 Mechanical Engineering Design Solution Here we will superpose the modes of deﬂection. They are: (1) translation due to the compression of spring kt, (2) rotation of the spring kr, and (3) the elastic deformation of beam 1 given in Table A–9.

Considering this mode of deﬂection only, the beam rotates rigidly clockwise, leading to a deﬂection equation of y2=−Fl krx (2) Finally, the elastic deformation of beam 1 from Table A–9 is y3=Fx2 6EI(x−3l) (3) Adding the deﬂections from each mode yields Answer y=Fx2 6EI(x−3l)−F kt−Fl krx 4–6 Beam Deﬂections by Singularity Functions Introduced in Sec. 3–3, singularity functions are excellent for managing discontinuities, and their application to beam deﬂection is a simple extension of what was presented in the ear- lier section. They are easy to program, and as will be seen later, they can greatly simplify the solution of statically indeterminate problems. The following examples illustrate the use of singularity functions to evaluate deﬂections of statically determinate beam problems.xy R1F l (a)M1 xkr ktF (b)R1Figure 4–5bud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/09 2:55PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Deﬂection and Stiffness 157 EXAMPLE 4–5 Consider beam 6 of Table A–9, which is a simply supported beam having a concen- trated load Fnot in the center. Develop the deﬂection equations using singularity functions. Solution First, write the load intensity equation from the free-body diagram, q=R1/angbracketleftx/angbracketright−1−F/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright−1+R2/angbracketleftx−l/angbracketright−1(1) Integrating Eq. (1) twice results in V=R1/angbracketleftx/angbracketright0−F/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright0+R2/angbracketleftx−l/angbracketright0(2) M=R1/angbracketleftx/angbracketright1−F/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright1+R2/angbracketleftx−l/angbracketright1(3) Recall that as long as the qequation is complete, integration constants are unnecessary for Vand M; therefore, they are not included up to this point. From statics, setting V=M=0 for xslightly greater than lyields R1=Fb/land R2=Fa/l. Thus Eq. (3) becomes M=Fb l/angbracketleftx/angbracketright1−F/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright1+Fa l/angbracketleftx−l/angbracketright1 Integrating Eqs. (4–12) and (4–13) as indeﬁnite integrals gives EIdy dx=Fb 2l/angbracketleftx/angbracketright2−F 2/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright2+Fa 2l/angbracketleftx−l/angbracketright2+C1 EIy=Fb 6l/angbracketleftx/angbracketright3−F 6/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright3+Fa 6l/angbracketleftx−l/angbracketright3+C1x+C2 Note that the ﬁrst singularity term in both equations always exists, so /angbracketleftx/angbracketright2=x2 and/angbracketleftx/angbracketright3=x3.Also, the last singularity term in both equations does not exist until x=l, where it is zero, and since there is no beam for x>lwe can drop the last term. Thus EIdy dx=Fb 2lx2−F 2/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright2+C1 (4) EIy=Fb 6lx3−F 6/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright3+C1x+C2 (5) The constants of integration C1and C2are evaluated by using the two boundary con- ditions y=0 at x=0 and y=0 at x=l. The ﬁrst condition, substituted into Eq. (5), gives C2=0 (recall that /angbracketleft0−a/angbracketright3=0). The second condition, substituted into Eq. (5), yields 0=Fb 6ll3−F 6(l−a)3+C1l=Fbl2 6−Fb3 6+C1l Solving for C1gives C1=−Fb 6l(l2−b2)bud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/09 2:55PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:158 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 4–6 xy R1wl a BAC R2Finally, substituting C1and C2in Eq. (5) and simplifying produces y=F 6EIl[bx(x2+b2−l2)−l/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright3] (6) Comparing Eq. (6) with the two deﬂection equations for beam 6 in Table A–9, we note that the use of singularity functions enables us to express the deﬂection equation with a single equation. EXAMPLE 4–6 Determine the deﬂection equation for the simply supported beam with the load distribu- tion shown in Fig. 4–6. Solution This is a good beam to add to our table for later use with superposition. The load inten- sity equation for the beam is q=R1/angbracketleftx/angbracketright−1−w/angbracketleftx/angbracketright0+w/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright0+R2/angbracketleftx−l/angbracketright−1(1) where the w/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright0is necessary to “turn off” the uniform load at x=a. From statics, the reactions are R1=wa 2l(2l−a) R2=wa2 2l(2) For simplicity, we will retain the form of Eq. (1) for integration and substitute the values of the reactions in later. Two integrations of Eq. (1) reveal V=R1/angbracketleftx/angbracketright0−w/angbracketleftx/angbracketright1+w/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright1+R2/angbracketleftx−l/angbracketright0(3) M=R1/angbracketleftx/angbracketright1−w 2/angbracketleftx/angbracketright2+w 2/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright2+R2/angbracketleftx−l/angbracketright1(4) As in the previous example, singularity functions of order zero or greater starting at x=0 can be replaced by normal polynomial functions. Also, once the reactions are determined, singularity functions starting at the extreme right end of the beam can be omitted. Thus, Eq. (4) can be rewritten as M=R1x−w 2x2+w 2/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright2(5)bud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/2009 7:54 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Deﬂection and Stiffness 159 Integrating two more times for slope and deﬂection gives EIdy dx=R1 2x2−w 6x3+w 6/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright3+C1 (6) EIy=R1 6x3−w 24x4+w 24/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright4+C1x+C2 (7) The boundary conditions are y=0 at x=0 and y=0 at x=l. Substituting the ﬁrst condition in Eq. (7) shows C2=0. For the second condition 0=R1 6l3−w 24l4+w 24(l−a)4+C1l Solving for C1and substituting into Eq. (7) yields EIy=R1 6x(x2−l2)−w 24x(x3−l3)−w 24lx(l−a)4+w 24/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright4 Finally, substitution of R1from Eq. (2) and simplifying results gives Answer y=w 24EIl[2ax(2l−a)(x2−l2)−xl(x3−l3)−x(l−a)4+l/angbracketleftx−a/angbracketright4] As stated earlier, singularity functions are relatively simple to program, as they are omitted when their arguments are negative, and the /angbracketleft/angbracketrightbrackets are replaced with ( ) parentheses when the arguments are positive. EXAMPLE 4–7 The steel step shaft shown in Fig. 4–7 ais mounted in bearings at Aand F.A pulley is centered at Cwhere a total radial force of 600 lbf is applied. Using singularity functions evaluate the shaft displacements at 1 2-in increments. Assume the shaft is simply supported. Solution The reactions are found to be R1=360 lbf and R2=240 lbf. Ignoring R2, using singularity functions, the moment equation is M=360x−600/angbracketleftx−8/angbracketright1(1) This is plotted in Fig. 4–7 b. For simpliﬁcation, we will consider only the step at D.That is, we will assume sec- tion ABhas the same diameter as BCand section EFhas the same diameter as DE. Since these sections are short and at the supports, the size reduction will not add much to the deformation. We will examine this simpliﬁcation later.

If the steps of the bearings were incorporated into the model, more equations result, but the process is the same. The solution to this model is y|x=8.5i n=−0.009387 in θA=−0.09763◦θF=0.06973◦ The largest difference between the models is of the order of 1.5 percent. Thus the sim- pliﬁcation was justiﬁed.bud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/09 2:55PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:162 Mechanical Engineering Design In Sec. 4–9, we will demonstrate the usefulness of singularity functions in solving statically indeterminate problems. 4–7 Strain Energy The external work done on an elastic member in deforming it is transformed into strain, or potential, energy . If the member is deformed a distance y, and if the force-deﬂection relationship is linear, this energy is equal to the product of the average force and the deﬂection, or U=F 2y=F2 2k(4–15) This equation is general in the sense that the force Fcan also mean torque, or moment, provided, of course, that consistent units are used for k. By substituting appropriate expressions for k, strain-energy formulas for various simple loadings may be obtained. For tension and compression, for example, we employ Eq. (4–4) and obtain U=F2l 2AE(4–16) or U=/integraldisplayF2 2AEdxtension and compression (4–17) where the ﬁrst equation applies when all the terms are constant throughout the length, and the more general integral equation allows for any of the terms to vary through the length. Similarly, from Eq. (4–7), the strain energy for torsion is given by U=T2l 2GJ(4–18) or U=/integraldisplayT2 2GJdxtorsion (4–19) To obtain an expression for the strain energy due to direct shear, consider the element with one side ﬁxed in Fig. 4–8 a. The force Fplaces the element in pure shear, and the work done is U=Fδ/2.Since the shear strain is γ=δ/l=τ/G=F/AG,we have U=F2l 2AG(4–20) or U=/integraldisplayF2 2AGdxdirect shear (4–21) dxAO Bdsd/H9258/H9267 (a) Pure shear element ( b) Beam bending elemen tFF F/H9253/H9254 lFigure 4–8⎫ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪ ⎭ ⎫ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪ ⎭ ⎫ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪ ⎭bud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/2009 7:54 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Deﬂection and Stiffness 163 The strain energy stored in a beam or lever by bending may be obtained by refer- ring to Fig. 4–8 b. Here ABis a section of the elastic curve of length dshaving a radius of curvature ρ. The strain energy stored in this element of the beam is dU=(M/2)dθ. Since ρdθ=ds, we have dU=Md s 2ρ(a) We can eliminate ρby using Eq. (4–8), ρ=EI/M. Thus dU=M2ds 2EI(b) For small deﬂections, ds.=dx. Then, for the entire beam U=/integraldisplay dU=/integraldisplayM2 2EIdx (c) The integral equation is commonly needed for bending, where the moment is typically a function of x. Summarized to include both the integral and nonintegral form, the strain energy for bending is U=M2l 2EI(4–22) or U=/integraldisplayM2 2EIdxbending (4–23) Equations (4–22) and (4–23) are exact only when a beam is subject to pure bend- ing. Even when transverse shear is present, these equations continue to give quite good results, except for very short beams. The strain energy due to shear loading of a beam is a complicated problem. An approximate solution can be obtained by using Eq. (4–20) with a correction factor whose value depends upon the shape of the cross section. If we use Cfor the correction factor and Vfor the shear force, then the strain energy due to shear in bending is U=CV2l 2AG(4–24) or U=/integraldisplayCV2 2AGdxtransverse shear (4–25) Values of the factor Care listed in Table 4–1.

Find the strain energy in the beam. Solution To determine what forms of strain energy are involved with the deﬂection of the beam, we break into the beam and draw a free-body diagram to see the forces and moments being carried within the beam. Figure 4–9 bshows such a diagram in which the transverse shear is V=− F, and the bending moment is M=− Fx. The variable xis simply a variable of integration and can be deﬁned to be measured from any convenient point. The same results will be obtained from a free-body diagram of the right-hand portion of the beam with x measured from the wall. Using the free end of the beam usually results in reduced effort since the ground reaction forces do not need to be determined. For the transverse shear, using Eq. (4–24) with the correction factor C=1.11from Table 4–2, and noting that Vis constant through the length of the beam, Ushear=CV2l 2AG=1.11F2l 2AG For the bending, since Mis a function of x, Eq.

This will be demonstrated in the next example.ymaxFl (a)Figure 4–9F M Vx (b) 4–8 Castigliano’s Theorem A most unusual, powerful, and often surprisingly simple approach to deﬂection analysis is afforded by an energy method called Castigliano’s theorem . It is a unique way of ana- lyzing deﬂections and is even useful for ﬁnding the reactions of indeterminate structures. Castigliano’s theorem states that when forces act on elastic systems subject to small dis- placements, the displacement corresponding to any force, in the direction of the force, is equal to the partial derivative of the total strain energy with respect to that force. Thebud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/2009 7:54 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Deﬂection and Stiffness 165 terms force and displacement in this statement are broadly interpreted to apply equally to moments and angular displacements. Mathematically, the theorem of Castigliano is δi=∂U ∂Fi(4–26) where δiis the displacement of the point of application of the force Fiin the direction of Fi. For rotational displacement Eq. (4–26) can be written as θi=∂U ∂Mi(4–27) where θiis the rotational displacement, in radians, of the beam where the moment Miexists and in the direction of Mi. As an example, apply Castigliano’s theorem using Eqs. (4–16) and (4–18) to get the axial and torsional deﬂections.

Solution (a) From Ex. 4–8, the total energy of the beam is U=F2l3 6EI+1.11F2l 2AG(1) Then, according to Castigliano’s theorem, the deﬂection of the end is ymax=∂U ∂F=Fl3 3EI+1.11Fl AG(2) We also ﬁnd that I=πd4 64=π(1)4 64=0.0491 in4 A=πd2 4=π(1)2 4=0.7854 in2 Substituting these values, together with F=100 lbf, l=10in, E=30Mpsi, and G=11.5Mpsi, in Eq. (3) gives Answer ymax=0.022 63 +0.000 12 =0.022 75 in Note that the result is positive because it is in the same direction as the force F. Answer (b) The error in neglecting shear for this problem is (0.02275 −0.02263)/0.02275 = 0.0053=0.53percent.bud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/09 2:55PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:166 Mechanical Engineering Design The relative contribution of transverse shear to beam deﬂection decreases as the length- to-height ratio of the beam increases, and is generally considered negligible for l/d>10. Note that the deﬂection equations for the beams in Table A–9 do not include the effects of transverse shear. Castigliano’s theorem can be used to ﬁnd the deﬂection at a point even though no force or moment acts there. The procedure is: 1Set up the equation for the total strain energy Uby including the energy due to a ﬁctitious force or moment Qacting at the point whose deﬂection is to be found. 2Find an expression for the desired deﬂection δ, in the direction of Q, by taking the derivative of the total strain energy with respect to Q. 3Since Qis a ﬁctitious force, solve the expression obtained in step 2 by setting Q equal to zero. Thus, the displacement at the point of application of the fictitious force Qis δ=∂U ∂Q/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle Q=0(4–28) In cases where integration is necessary to obtain the strain energy, it is more efﬁ- cient to obtain the deﬂection directly without explicitly ﬁnding the strain energy, by moving the partial derivative inside the integral. For the example of the bending case, δi=∂U ∂Fi=∂ ∂Fi/parenleftbigg/integraldisplayM2 2EIdx/parenrightbigg =/integraldisplay∂ ∂Fi/parenleftbiggM2 2EI/parenrightbigg dx=/integraldisplay2M∂M ∂Fi 2EIdx =/integraldisplay1 EI/parenleftbigg M∂M ∂Fi/parenrightbigg dx This allows the derivative to be taken before integration, simplifying the mathematics. This method is especially helpful if the force is a ﬁctitious force Q, since it can be set to zero as soon as the derivative is taken. The expressions for the common cases in Eqs. (4–17), (4–19), and (4–23) are rewritten as δi=∂U ∂Fi=/integraldisplay1 AE/parenleftbigg F∂F ∂Fi/parenrightbigg dx tension and compression (4–29) θi=∂U ∂Mi=/integraldisplay1 GJ/parenleftbigg T∂T ∂Mi/parenrightbigg dx torsion (4–30) δi=∂U ∂Fi=/integraldisplay1 EI/parenleftbigg M∂M ∂Fi/parenrightbigg dx bending (4–31) EXAMPLE 4–10 Using Castigliano’s method, determine the deﬂections of points Aand Bdue to the force Fapplied at the end of the step shaft shown in Fig. 4–10.

The determination of stresses in curved members has already been described in Sec. 3–18. Castigliano’s theorem is particularly useful for the analysis of deﬂections in curved parts too.6Consider, for example, the curved frame of Fig. 4–12 a. We are 6For more solutions than are included here, see Joseph E. Shigley, “Curved Beams and Rings,” Chap. 38 in Joseph E. Shigley, Charles R. Mischke, and Thomas H.

The strain energy component due to the normal force Fθconsists of two parts, one of which is axial and analogous to Eq. (4–17). This part is U2=/integraldisplayF2 θRdθ 2AE(4–34) The force Fθalso produces a moment, which opposes the moment Min Fig. 4–12 b. The resulting strain energy will be subtractive and is U3=−/integraldisplayMFθdθ AE(4–35) The negative sign of Eq. (4–35) can be appreciated by referring to both parts of Fig. 4–12. Note that the moment Mtends to decrease the angle dθ. On the other hand, the moment due to Fθtends to increase dθ. Thus U3is negative. If Fθhad been acting in the opposite direction, then both Mand Fθwould tend to decrease the angle dθ. The fourth and last term is the transverse shear energy due to Fr. Adapting Eq.

For the speciﬁc curved beam in Fig. 4–12 b, the integrals are evaluated from 0 to π. Also, for this case we ﬁnd M=FRsinθ∂M ∂F=Rsinθ Fθ=Fsinθ∂Fθ ∂F=sinθ MFθ=F2Rsin2θ∂(MFθ) ∂F=2FRsin2θ Fr=Fcosθ∂Fr ∂F=cosθ Substituting these into Eq.

For curved sections in which the radius is signiﬁcantly larger than the thickness, say R/h>10, the effect of the eccentricity is negligible, so that the strain energies can be approximated directly from Eqs. (4–17), (4–23), and (4–25) with a substitution of Rdθ for dx. Further, as Rincreases, the contributions to deﬂection from the normal force and tangential force becomes negligibly small compared to the bending component. Therefore, an approximate result can be obtained for a thin circular curved member as U.=/integraldisplayM2 2EIRdθ R/h>10 (4–40) δ=∂U ∂F.=/integraldisplay1 EI/parenleftbigg M∂M ∂F/parenrightbigg Rdθ R/h>10 (4–41)bud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/09 2:55PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:172 Mechanical Engineering Design EXAMPLE 4–12 The cantilevered hook shown in Fig. 4–13 ais formed from a round steel wire with a diameter of 2 mm. The hook dimensions are l=40and R=50mm. A force Pof 1 N is applied at point C. Use Castigliano’s theorem to estimate the deﬂection at point Dat the tip. Solution Since l/dand R/dare significantly greater than 10, only the contributions due to bending will be considered. To obtain the vertical deflection at D, a fictitious force Qwill be applied there. Free-body diagrams are shown in Figs. 4–13 b, c, and d, with breaks in sections AB, BC, and CD, respectively. The normal and shear forces, Nand Vrespectively, are shown but are considered negligible in the deflec- tion analysis.

(4–39), δ=πFR2 2AeE−πFR 2AE+πCFR 2AG is useful in sections that are uniform and in which the centroidal locus is circular. The bending moment is largest where the material is farthest from the load axis. Strengthening requires a larger second area moment I. A variable-depth cross section is attractive, but it makes the integration to a closed form very difﬁcult. However, if you are seeking results, numerical integration with computer assistance is helpful. Consider the steel C frame depicted in Fig. 4–14 ain which the centroidal radius is 32 in, the cross section at the ends is 2i n×2i n,and the depth varies sinusoidally withbud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/2009 8:14 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:174 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 4–14 (a) A steel punch press has a Cframe with a varying-depth rectangular cross section depicted. The cross section varies sinusoidally from 2i n×2in at θ=0◦to 2i n×6in at θ=90◦, and back to 2i n×2in at θ=180◦.

Such a system is said to be statically indeter- minate and the extra constraint supports are called redundant supports. In addition to the static equilibrium equations, a deﬂection equation is required for each redundant support reaction in order to obtain a solution. For example, consider a beam in bending with a wall support on one end and a simple support on the other, such as beam 12 of Table A–9. There are three support reactions and only two static equilibrium equations are available. This beam has oneredundant support. To solve for the three unknown support reactions we use the two equilibrium equations and oneadditional deﬂection equation. For another example, consider beam 15 of Table A–9. This beam has a wall on both ends, giving rise to tworedundant supports requiring twodeﬂection equations in addition to the equations from statics. The purpose of redundant supports is to provide safety and reduce deﬂection. A simple example of a statically indeterminate problem is furnished by the nested helical springs in Fig. 4–15 a. When this assembly is loaded by the compressive force F, it deforms through the distance δ. What is the compressive force in each spring? Only one equation of static equilibrium can be written. It is /summationdisplay F=F−F1−F2=0 (a) which simply says that the total force Fis resisted by a force F1in spring 1 plus the force F2in spring 2. Since there are two unknowns and only one static equilibrium equation, the system is statically indeterminate. To write another equation, note the deformation relation in Fig. 4–15 b. The two springs have the same deformation. Thus, we obtain the second equation as δ1=δ2=δ (b) If we now substitute Eq. (4–2) in Eq. ( b), we have F1 k1=F2 k2(c) 8See Case Study 4, p. 203, J. E. Shigley and C. R. Mischke, Mechanical Engineering Design, 6th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 2001.bud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/09 2:55PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:176 Mechanical Engineering Design Now we solve Eq. ( c) for F1and substitute the result in Eq. ( a). This gives F−k1 k2F2−F2=0o r F2=k2F k1+k2(d) Substituting F2into Eq. ( c) gives F1=k1F/(k1+k2)and so δ=δ1=δ2= F/(k1+k2). Thus, for two springs in parallel, the overall spring constant is k=F/δ=k1+k2. In the spring example, obtaining the necessary deformation equation was very straightforward. However, for other situations, the deformation relations may not be as easy. A more structured approach may be necessary. Here we will show two basic pro- cedures for general statically indeterminate problems. Procedure 1 1Choose the redundant reaction(s). There may be alternative choices (See Ex- ample 4–14). 2Write the equations of static equilibrium for the remaining reactions in terms of the applied loads and the redundant reaction(s) of step 1. 3Write the deflection equation(s) for the point(s) at the locations of the redundant reaction(s) of step 1 in terms of the applied loads and the redundant reaction(s) of step 1. Normally the deflection(s) is (are) zero. If a redundant reaction is a moment, the corresponding deflection equation is a rotational deflection equation. 4The equations from steps 2 and 3 can now be solved to determine the reactions. In step 3 the deflection equations can be solved in any of the standard ways. Here we will demonstrate the use of superposition and Castigliano’s theorem on a beam problem.Figure 4–15 (a) (b)k1 k2 F1 F2F k2k1/H9254 /H9254bud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/09 2:55PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Deﬂection and Stiffness 177 EXAMPLE 4–14 The indeterminate beam 11 of Appendix Table A–9 is reproduced in Fig. 4–16.

This results in R1=F−R2 M1=Fl 2−R2l (1) 3Write the deﬂection equation for point Bin terms of Fand R2.

Solution There is a lot going on in this problem; a rod shortens, the rods stretch in tension, and the beam bends. Let’s try the procedure! 1The free-body diagram of the beam is shown in Fig. 4–17 b.

If you were to take a long rod or pole, such as a meterstick, and apply gradually increasing compressive forces at each end, nothing would happen at ﬁrst, but then the stick would bend (buckle), and ﬁnally bend so much as to fracture. Try it. The other extreme would occur if you were to saw off, say, a 5-mm length of the meterstick and perform the same experiment on the short piece. You would then observe that the failure exhibits itself as a mashing of the specimen, that is, a simple compressive failure. For these reasons it is convenient to classify compression members according to their length and according to whether the loading is central or eccentric. The term column is applied to all such members except those in which fail- ure would be by simple or pure compression. Columns can be categorized then as: 1Long columns with central loading 2Intermediate-length columns with central loading 3Columns with eccentric loading 4Struts or short columns with eccentric loading Classifying columns as above makes it possible to develop methods of analysis and design speciﬁc to each category. Furthermore, these methods will also reveal whether or not you have selected the category appropriate to your particular problem. The four sections that follow correspond, respectively, to the four categories of columns listed above. 4–12 Long Columns with Central Loading Figure 4–18 shows long columns with differing end (boundary) conditions. If the axial force Pshown acts along the centroidal axis of the column, simple compression of the member occurs for low values of the force. However, under certain conditions, when P reaches a specific value, the column becomes unstable and bending as shown in Fig. 4–18 develops rapidly. This force is determined by writing the bending deﬂection equation for the column, resulting in a differential equation where when the boundary conditions are applied, results in the critical load for unstable bending.9The critical force for the pin-ended column of Fig. 4–18 ais given by Pcr=π2EI l2(4–42) which is called the Euler column formula . Equation (4–42) can be extended to apply to other end-conditions by writing Pcr=Cπ2EI l2(4–43) where the constant Cdepends on the end conditions as shown in Fig. 4–18.Deﬂection and Stiffness 181 9See F. P. Beer, E. R. Johnston, Jr., and J. T. DeWolf, Mechanics of Materials, 5th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 2009, pp. 610–613.bud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 11/27/09 2:55PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:182 Mechanical Engineering Design Using the relation I=Ak2, where Ais the area and kthe radius of gyration, enables us to rearrange Eq. (4–43) into the more convenient form Pcr A=Cπ2E (l/k)2(4–44) where l/kis called the slenderness ratio. This ratio, rather than the actual column length, will be used in classifying columns according to length categories. The quantity Pcr/Ain Eq. (4–44) is the critical unit load . It is the load per unit area necessary to place the column in a condition of unstable equilibrium. In this state any small crookedness of the member, or slight movement of the support or load, will cause the column to begin to collapse. The unit load has the same units as strength, but this is the strength of a speciﬁc column, not of the column material. Doubling the length of a member, for example, will have a drastic effect on the value of Pcr/Abut no effect at all on, say, the yield strength Syof the column material itself. Equation (4–44) shows that the critical unit load depends only upon the end con- ditions, the modulus of elasticity, and the slenderness ratio. Thus a column obeying the Euler formula made of high-strength alloy steel is no stronger than one made of low- carbon steel, since Eis the same for both. The factor Cis called the end-condition constant, and it may have any one of the theoretical values 1 4, 1, 2, and 4, depending upon the manner in which the load is applied. In practice it is difﬁcult, if not impossible, to ﬁx the column ends so that the factor C=2or C=4would apply. Even if the ends are welded, some deﬂection will occur. Because of this, some designers never use a value of Cgreater than unity. However, if liberal factors of safety are employed, and if the column load is accurately known, then a value of Cnot exceeding 1.2 for both ends ﬁxed, or for one end rounded and one end ﬁxed, is not unreasonable, since it supposes only partial ﬁxation. Of course, the value C=1 4must always be used for a column having one end ﬁxed and one end free. These recommendations are summarized in Table 4–2. When Eq. (4–44) is solved for various values of the unit load Pcr/Ain terms of the slenderness ratio l/k, we obtain the curve PQR shown in Fig. 4–19. Since the yield strength of the material has the same units as the unit load, the horizontal line through Syand Qhas been added to the ﬁgure. This would appear to make the ﬁgure SyQR cover the entire range of compression problems from the shortest to the longestFigure 4–18 (a) Both ends rounded or pivoted; ( b) both ends ﬁxed; (c) one end free and one end ﬁxed; ( d) one end rounded and pivoted, and one end ﬁxed.

Thus it would appear that any compression member having an l/kvalue less than (l/k)Qshould be treated as a pure compression member while all others are to be treated as Euler columns. Unfortunately, this is not true. In the actual design of a member that functions as a column, the designer will be aware of the end conditions shown in Fig. 4–18, and will endeavor to conﬁgure the ends, using bolts, welds, or pins, for example, so as to achieve the required ideal end condi- tions. In spite of these precautions, the result, following manufacture, is likely to contain defects such as initial crookedness or load eccentricities. The existence of such defects and the methods of accounting for them will usually involve a factor-of-safety approach or a stochastic analysis. These methods work well for long columns and for simple compression members. However, tests show numerous failures for columns with slenderness ratios below and in the vicinity of point Q, as shown in the shaded area in Fig. 4–19. These have been reported as occurring even when near-perfect geometric specimens were used in the testing procedure. A column failure is always sudden, total, unexpected, and hence dangerous. There is no advance warning. A beam will bend and give visual warning that it is over- loaded, b ut not so for a column. For this reason neither simple compression methods nor the Euler column equation should be used when the slenderness ratio is near (l/k)Q. Then what should we do? The usual approach is to choose some point Ton the Euler curve of Fig. 4–19. If the slenderness ratio is speciﬁed as (l/k)1correspond- ing to point T, then use the Euler equation only when the actual slenderness ratio isTable 4–2 End-Condition Constants for Euler Columns [to Be Used with Eq.

Otherwise, use one of the methods in the sections that follow. See Examples 4–17 and 4–18. Most designers select point Tsuch that Pcr/A=Sy/2. Using Eq.

Many of these are based on the use of a single material; others, on a so-called safe unit load rather than the crit- ical value. Most of these formulas are based on the use of a linear relationship between the slenderness ratio and the unit load. The parabolic or J. B. Johnson formula now seems to be the preferred one among designers in the machine, automotive, aircraft, and structural-steel construction ﬁelds. The general form of the parabolic formula is Pcr A=a−b/parenleftbiggl k/parenrightbigg2 (a) where aand bare constants that are evaluated by ﬁtting a parabola to the Euler curve of Fig. 4–19 as shown by the dashed line ending at T.

Though these deviations are often quite small, it is still convenient to have a method of dealing with them. Frequently, too, problems occur in which load eccentricities are unavoidable. Figure 4–20 ashows a column in which the line of action of the column forces is separated from the centroidal axis of the column by the eccentricity e. From Fig. 4–20 b, M=− P(e+y).

At this point, permanent set is introduced and usefulness as a machine member may be at an end. If the force Pis increased still more, the material either becomes “barrel-like” or fractures. When there is eccentricity in the loading, the elastic limit is encountered at smaller loads. A strut is a short compression member such as the one shown in Fig. 4–22. The magnitude of the maximum compressive stress in the xdirection at point Bin an inter- mediate section is the sum of a simple component P/Aand a ﬂexural component Mc/I; that is, σc=P A+Mc I=P A+PecA IA=P A/parenleftbigg 1+ec k2/parenrightbigg (4–55) where k=(I/A)1/2and is the radius of gyration, cis the coordinate of point B, and e is the eccentricity of loading. Note that the length of the strut does not appear in Eq. (4–55). In order to use the equation for design or analysis, we ought, therefore, to know the range of lengths for which the equation is valid. In other words, how long is a short member? The difference between the secant formula Eq. (4–50) and Eq. (4–55) is that the secant equation, unlike Eq. (4–55), accounts for an increased bending moment due to bending deﬂection. Thus the secant equation shows the eccentricity to be magniﬁed by the bending deﬂection. This difference between the two formulas suggests that one wayFigure 4–22 Eccentrically loaded strut.yx PP l cBebud29281_ch04_147-211.qxd 12/9/09 8:51PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:of differentiating between a “secant column” and a strut, or short compression member, is to say that in a strut, the effect of bending deﬂection must be limited to a certain small percentage of the eccentricity. If we decide that the limiting percentage is to be 1 per- cent of e, then, from Eq. (4–44), the limiting slenderness ratio turns out to be /parenleftbiggl k/parenrightbigg 2=0.282/parenleftbiggAE P/parenrightbigg1/2 (4–56) This equation then gives the limiting slenderness ratio for using Eq. (4–55). If the actual slenderness ratio is greater than (l/k)2, then use the secant formula; otherwise, use Eq. (4–55). EXAMPLE 4–20 Figure 4–23 ashows a workpiece clamped to a milling machine table by a bolt tight- ened to a tension of 2000 lbf. The clamp contact is offset from the centroidal axis of the strut by a distance e=0.10in, as shown in part bof the ﬁgure. The strut, or block, is steel, 1 in square and 4 in long, as shown. Determine the maximum compressive stress in the block. Solution First we ﬁnd A=bh=1(1)=1i n2, I=bh3/12=1(1)3/12=0.0833 in4, k2= I/A=0.0833/1=0.0833 in2, and l/k=4/(0.0833)1/2=13.9.

Elastic instability can also occur in structural members other than columns. Compressive loads/stresses within any long, thin structure can cause structural instabilities (buckling). The compressive stress may be elastic or inelastic and the instability may be global or local. Global instabilities can cause catastrophic failure, whereas local instabilities may cause permanent deformation and function failure but not a catastrophic failure. The buckling discussed in Sec. 4–12 was global instability. However, consider a wide ﬂange beam in bending. One ﬂange will be in compression, and if thin enough, can develop localized buckling in a region where the bending moment is a maximum. Localized buckling can also occur in the web of the beam, where transverse shear stresses are present at the beam centroid. Recall, for the case of pure shear stress τ, a stress transformation will show that at 45◦, a compressive stress of σ=−τexists. If the web is sufﬁciently thin where the shear force Vis a maximum, localized buckling of the web can occur. For this reason, additional support in the form of bracing is typically applied at locations of high shear forces.10 Thin-walled beams in bending can buckle in a torsional mode as illustrated in Fig. 4–24. Here a cantilever beam is loaded with a lateral force, F. As Fis increases from zero, the end of the beam will deﬂect in the negative ydirection normally accord- ing to the bending equation, y=− FL3/(3EI). However, if the beam is long enough and the ratio of b/his sufﬁciently small, there is a critical value of Ffor which the beam will collapse in a twisting mode as shown. This is due to the compression in the bottom ﬁbers of the beam which cause the ﬁbers to buckle sideways ( zdirection). There are a great many other examples of unstable structural behavior, such as thin- walled pressure vessels in compression or with outer pressure or inner vacuum, thin-walled open or closed members in torsion, thin arches in compression, frames in compression, and shear panels. Because of the vast array of applications and the complexity of their analyses, further elaboration is beyond the scope of this book. The intent of this section is to make the reader aware of the possibilities and potential safety issues. The key issue is that the designer should be aware that if any unbraced part of a structural member is thin, and/or long, and in compression (directly or indirectly ), the possibility of buckling should be investigated.11 For unique applications, the designer may need to revert to a numerical solution such as using ﬁnite elements. Depending on the application and the ﬁnite-element code available, an analysis can be performed to determine the critical loading (see Fig. 4–25).190 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 4–24 Torsional buckling of a thin-walled beam in bending.

In some cases it is desirable to achieve a known impact in design; for example, this is the case in the design of coining, stamping, and forming presses. In other cases, impact occurs because of excessive deﬂections, or because of clearances between parts, and in these cases it is desirable to minimize the effects. The rattling of mating gear teeth in their tooth spaces is an impact problem caused by shaft deﬂection and the clearance between the teeth. This impact causes gear noise and fatigue failure of the tooth surfaces. The clearance space between a cam and follower or between a journal and its bearing may result in crossover impact and also cause excessive noise and rapid fatigue failure. Shock is a more general term that is used to describe any suddenly applied force or disturbance. Thus the study of shock includes impact as a special case. Figure 4–26 represents a highly simpliﬁed mathematical model of an automobile in collision with a rigid obstruction. Here m1is the lumped mass of the engine. The displacement, velocity, and acceleration are described by the coordinate x1and its time deriv atives. The lumped mass of the vehicle less the engine is denoted by m2, and its motion by the coordinate x2and its derivatives. Springs k1, k2, and k3represent the linear and nonlinear stiffnesses of the various structural elements that compose the vehicle. Friction and damping can and should be included, but is not shown in this model. The determination of the spring rates for such a complex structure will almost certainly have to be performed experimentally. Once these values—the k’s, m’s, damping and frictional coefﬁcients—are obtained, a set of nonlinear differential equations can be written and a computer solution obtained for any impact velocity. For sake of illustra- tion, assuming the springs to be linear, isolate each mass and write their equations of motion. This results in m¨x1+k1x1+k2(x1−x2)=0 m¨x2+k3x2−k2(x1−x2)=0(4–57) The analytical solution of the Eq. (4–57) pair is harmonic and is studied in a course on mechanical vibrations.12If the values of the m’s and k’s are known, the solution can be obtained easily using a program such as MATLAB. Suddenly Applied Loading A simple case of impact is illustrated in Fig. 4–27 a. Here a weight Wfalls a distance h and impacts a cantilever of stiffness EIand length l. We want to ﬁnd the maximum deﬂection and the maximum force exerted on the beam due to the impact.Deﬂection and Stiffness 191 Figure 4–26 Two-degree-of-freedom mathematical model of an automobile in collision with a rigid obstruction.x1 k1 k2 k3x2 m1 m2 12See William T.

For beam 1 of Table A–9, we ﬁnd the spring rate to be k=F/y=3EI/l3. The beam mass and damping can be accounted for, but for this example will be con- sidered negligible. If the beam is considered massless, there is no momentum transfer, only energy. If the maximum deﬂection of the spring (beam) is considered to be δ, the drop of the weight is h+δ, and the loss of potential energy is W(h+δ). The resulting increase in potential (strain) energy of the spring is 1 2kδ2. Thus, for energy conserva- tion, 1 2kδ2=W(h+δ). Rearranging this gives δ2−2W kδ−2W kh=0 (a) Solving for δyields δ=W k±W k/parenleftbigg 1+2hk W/parenrightbigg1/2 (b) The negative solution is possible only if the weight “sticks” to the beam and vibrates between the limits of Eq. ( b). Thus, the maximum deﬂection is δ=W k+W k/parenleftbigg 1+2hk W/parenrightbigg1/2 (4–58) The maximum force acting on the beam is now found to be F=kδ=W+W/parenleftbigg 1+2hk W/parenrightbigg1/2 (4–59) Note, in this equation, that if h=0, then F=2W. This says that when the weight is released while in contact with the spring but is not exerting any force on the spring, the largest force is double the weight. Most systems are not as ideal as those explored here, so be wary about using these relations for nonideal systems. PROBLEMS Problems marked with an asterisk (*) are linked to problems in other chapters, as summarized in Table 1–1 of Sec. 1–16, p. 24. 4–1 The ﬁgure shows a torsion bar OAﬁxed at O, simply supported at A, and connected to a can- tilever AB. The spring rate of the torsion bar is kT, in newton-meters per radian, and that of the cantilever is kl, in newtons per meter.

An engineer needs a stiffer one than usual and so considers building in both ends and applying the torque somewhere in the cen- tral portion of the span, as shown in the figure. This effectively creates two springs in paral- lel. If the bar is uniform in diameter, that is, if d=d1=d2, (a) determine how the spring rate and the end reactions depend on the location xat which the torque is applied, ( b) determine the spring rate, the end reactions, and the maximum shear stress, if d=0.5in, x=5in,l=10in, T=1500 lbf ·in, and G=11.5Mpsi. Problem 4–1LO A RBF l y Problem 4–3 xlT d1d2 4–4 An engineer is forced by geometric considerations to apply the torque on the spring of Prob. 4–3 at the location x=0.4l. For a uniform-diameter spring, this would cause one leg of the span to be underutilized when both legs have the same diameter. For optimal design the diameter of each leg should be designed such that the maximum shear stress in each leg is the same. This problem is to redesign the spring of part ( b) of Prob. 4–3. Using x=0.4l, l=10in, T=1500 lbf ·in, and G=11.5Mpsi, design the spring such that the maximum shear stresses in each leg are equal and the spring has the same spring rate (angle of twist) as part ( b) of Prob. 4–3. Specify d1, d2, the spring rate k, and the torque and the maximum shear stress in each leg. 4–5 A bar in tension has a circular cross section and includes a tapered portion of length l, as shown.

This property results from the material identity, the treatment and processing incidental to creating its geometry, and the loading, and it is at the controlling or critical location. In addition to considering the strength of a single part, we must be cognizant that the strengths of the mass-produced parts will all be somewhat different from the others in the collection or ensemble because of variations in dimensions, machining, forming, and composition. Descriptors of strength are necessarily statistical in nature, involving parameters such as mean, standard deviations, and distributional identification. A static load is a stationary force or couple applied to a member. To be stationary, the force or couple must be unchanging in magnitude, point or points of application, and direction. A static load can produce axial tension or compression, a shear load, a bending load, a torsional load, or any combination of these. To be considered static, the load cannot change in any manner. In this chapter we consider the relations between strength and static loading in order to make the decisions concerning material and its treatment, fabrication, and geometry for satisfying the requirements of functionality, safety, reliability, competitiveness, usability, manufacturability, and marketability. How far we go down this list is related to the scope of the examples. “Failure” is the ﬁrst word in the chapter title. Failure can mean a part has sepa- rated into two or more pieces; has become permanently distorted, thus ruining its geometry; has had its reliability downgraded; or has had its function compromised, whatever the reason. A designer speaking of failure can mean any or all of these pos- sibilities. In this chapter our attention is focused on the predictability of permanent distortion or separation. In strength-sensitive situations the designer must separate mean stress and mean strength at the critical location sufﬁciently to accomplish his or her purposes. Figures 5–1 to 5–5 are photographs of several failed parts. The photographs exem- plify the need of the designer to be well-versed in failure prevention. Toward this end we shall consider one-, two-, and three-dimensional stress states, with and without stress concentrations, for both ductile and brittle materials.

The fractures exhibit the classic 45° shear failure. 5–1 Static Strength Ideally, in designing any machine element, the engineer should have available the results of a great many strength tests of the particular material chosen. These tests should be made on specimens having the same heat treatment, surface ﬁnish, and size as the element the engineer proposes to design; and the tests should be made under exactly the same loading conditions as the part will experience in service. This means that if the part is to experience a bending load, it should be tested with a bending load. If it is to be subjected to combined bending and torsion, it should be tested under combined bending and torsion. If it is made of heat-treated AISI 1040 steel drawn at 500°C with a ground ﬁnish, the speci mens tested should be of the same material prepared in the same manner. Such tests will provide very useful and precise information. Whenever such data are available for design purposes, the engineer can be assured of doing the best possible job of engineering. The cost of gathering such extensive data prior to design is justiﬁed if failure of the part may endanger human life or if the part is manufactured in sufﬁciently large quan- tities. Refrigerators and other appliances, for example, have very good reliabilities because the parts are made in such large quantities that they can be thoroughly tested in advance of manufacture. The cost of making these tests is very low when it is divided by the total number of parts manufactured. You can now appreciate the following four design categories: 1Failure of the part would endanger human life, or the part is made in extremely large quantities; consequently, an elaborate testing program is justified during design. 2The part is made in large enough quantities that a moderate series of tests is feasible. 3The part is made in such small quantities that testing is not justiﬁed at all; or the design must be completed so rapidly that there is not enough time for testing. 4The part has already been designed, manufactured, and tested and found to be unsatisfactory. Analysis is required to understand why the part is unsatisfactory and what to do to improve it. bud29281_ch05_212-264.qxd 11/27/2009 6:46 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Failures Resulting from Static Loading 217 More often than not it is necessary to design using only published values of yield strength, ultimate strength, percentage reduction in area, and percentage elongation, such as those listed in Appendix A. How can one use such meager data to design against both static and dynamic loads, two- and three-dimensional stress states, high and low temperatures, and very large and very small parts? These and similar questions will be addressed in this chapter and those to follow, but think how much better it would be to have data available that duplicate the actual design situation. 5–2 Stress Concentration Stress concentration (see Sec. 3–13) is a highly localized effect. In some instances it may be due to a surface scratch. If the material is ductile and the load static, the design load may cause yielding in the critical location in the notch. This yielding can involve strain strengthening of the material and an increase in yield strength at the small criti- cal notch location. Since the loads are static and the material is ductile, that part can carry the loads satisfactorily with no general yielding. In these cases the designer sets the geometric (theoretical) stress-concentration factor Ktto unity. The rationale can be expressed as follows. The worst-case scenario is that of an idealized non–strain-strengthening material shown in Fig. 5–6. The stress-strain curve rises linearly to the yield strength Sy, then proceeds at constant stress, which is equal to Sy. Consider a ﬁlleted rectangular bar as depicted in Fig. A–15–5, where the cross- section area of the small shank is 1 in2. If the material is ductile, with a yield point of 40 kpsi, and the theoretical stress-concentration factor (SCF) Ktis 2, •A load of 20 kip induces a nominal tensile stress of 20 kpsi in the shank as depicted at point Ain Fig. 5–6. At the critical location in the ﬁllet the stress is 40 kpsi, and the SCF is K=σmax/σnom=40/20=2. •A load of 30 kip induces a nominal tensile stress of 30 kpsi in the shank at point B. The ﬁllet stress is still 40 kpsi (point D), and the SCF K=σmax/σnom=Sy/σ= 40/30=1.33. •At a load of 40 kip the induced tensile stress (point C) is 40 kpsi in the shank. At the critical location in the ﬁllet, the stress (at point E) is 40 kpsi. The SCF K=σmax/σnom=Sy/σ=40/40=1. 50 0Sy Tensile strain, /H9280Tensile stress /H9268, kpsi ABDECFigure 5–6 An idealized stress-strain curve. The dashed line depicts a strain-strengthening material.bud29281_ch05_212-264.qxd 12/7/09 7:22PM ntt G4 Mac OS 9.2:Desktop Folder:MHDQ196/Budynas:218 Mechanical Engineering Design For materials that strain-strengthen, the critical location in the notch has a higher Sy. The shank area is at a stress level a little below 40 kpsi, is carrying load, and is very near its failure-by-general-yielding condition. This is the reason designers do not apply Ktin static loading of a ductile material loaded elastically, instead setting Kt=1. When using this rule for ductile materials with static loads, be careful to assure yourself that the material is not susceptible to brittle fracture (see Sec. 5–12) in the environment of use. The usual deﬁnition of geometric (theoretical) stress-concentration factor for normal stress Ktand shear stress Ktsis given by Eq. pair (3–48) as σmax=Ktσnom (a) τmax=Ktsτnom (b) Since your attention is on the stress-concentration factor, and the deﬁnition of σnomor τnomis given in the graph caption or from a computer program, be sure the value of nominal stress is appropriate for the section carrying the load. As shown in Fig. 2–2 b, p. 33, brittle materials do not exhibit a plastic range. The stress-concentration factor given by Eq. ( a) or ( b) could raise the stress to a level to cause fracture to initiate at the stress raiser, and initiate a catastrophic failure of the member. An exception to this rule is a brittle material that inherently contains microdiscon- tinuity stress concentration, worse than the macrodiscontinuity that the designer has in mind. Sand molding introduces sand particles, air, and water vapor bubbles. The grain structure of cast iron contains graphite ﬂakes (with little strength), which are literally cracks introduced during the solidiﬁcation process. When a tensile test on a cast iron is performed, the strength reported in the literature includes this stress concentration. In such cases Ktor Ktsneed not be applied. An important source of stress-concentration factors is R. E. Peterson, who com- piled them from his own work and that of others.1Peterson developed the style of presentation in which the stress-concentration factor Ktis multiplied by the nominal stress σnomto estimate the magnitude of the largest stress in the locality. His approxi- mations were based on photoelastic studies of two-dimensional strips (Hartman and Levan, 1951; Wilson and White, 1973), with some limited data from three-dimensional photoelastic tests of Hartman and Levan. A contoured graph was included in the presentation of each case. Filleted shafts in tension were based on two-dimensional strips. Table A–15 provides many charts for the theoretical stress-concentration factors for several fundamental load conditions and geometry. Additional charts are also avail- able from Peterson.2 Finite element analysis (FEA) can also be applied to obtain stress-concentration factors. Improvements on Ktand Ktsfor ﬁlleted shafts were reported by Tipton, Sorem, and Rolovic.3 1R. E.

Testing machines appeared in the 1700s, and specimens were pulled, bent, and twisted in simple loading processes. If the failure mechanism is simple, then simple tests can give clues. Just what is simple? The tension test is uniaxial (that’s simple) and elongations are largest in the axial direction, so strains can be measured and stresses inferred up to “failure.” Just what is important: a critical stress, a critical strain, a critical energy? In the next several sections, we shall show failure theories that have helped answer some of these questions. Unfortunately, there is no universal theory of failure for the general case of mate- rial properties and stress state. Instead, over the years several hypotheses have been formulated and tested, leading to today’s accepted practices. Being accepted, we will characterize these “practices” as theories as most designers do. Structural metal behavior is typically classiﬁed as being ductile or brittle, although under special situations, a material normally considered ductile can fail in a brittle manner (see Sec. 5–12). Ductile materials are normally classiﬁed such that εf≥0.05 and have an identiﬁable yield strength that is often the same in compression as in ten- sion (Syt=Syc=Sy).Brittle materials, εf<0.05, do not exhibit an identiﬁable yield strength, and are typically classiﬁed by ultimate tensile and compressive strengths, Sut and Suc,respectively (where Sucis given as a positive quantity). The generally accepted theories are: Ductile materials (yield criteria) •Maximum shear stress (MSS), Sec. 5–4 •Distortion energy (DE), Sec. 5–5 •Ductile Coulomb-Mohr (DCM), Sec. 5–6 Brittle materials (fracture criteria) •Maximum normal stress (MNS), Sec. 5–8 •Brittle Coulomb-Mohr (BCM), Sec. 5–9 •Modiﬁed Mohr (MM), Sec. 5–9 It would be inviting if we had one universally accepted theory for each material type, but for one reason or another, they are all used. Later, we will provide rationales for selecting a particular theory. First, we will describe the bases of these theories and apply them to some examples. 5–4 Maximum-Shear-Stress Theory for Ductile Materials The maximum-shear-stress (MSS) theory predicts that yielding begins whenever the maximum shear stress in any element equals or exceeds the maximum shear stress in a tension-test specimen of the same material when that specimen begins to yield . The MSS theory is also referred to as the Tresca or Guest theory . Many theories are postulated on the basis of the consequences seen from tensile tests. As a strip of a ductile material is subjected to tension, slip lines (called Lüder lines ) form at approximately 45° with the axis of the strip. These slip lines are thebud29281_ch05_212-264.qxd 11/27/2009 6:46 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:220 Mechanical Engineering Design beginning of yield, and when loaded to fracture, fracture lines are also seen at angles approximately 45° with the axis of tension. Since the shear stress is maximum at 45° from the axis of tension, it makes sense to think that this is the mechanism of failure. It will be shown in the next section, that there is a little more going on than this. However, it turns out the MSS theory is an acceptable but conservative predictor of failure; and since engineers are conservative by nature, it is quite often used. Recall that for simple tensile stress, σ=P/A,and the maximum shear stress occurs on a surface 45° from the tensile surface with a magnitude of τmax=σ/2.So the maximum shear stress at yield is τmax=Sy/2.For a general state of stress, three prin- cipal stresses can be determined and ordered such that σ1≥σ2≥σ3. The maximum shear stress is then τmax=(σ1−σ3)/2(see Fig. 3–12). Thus, for a general state of stress, the maximum-shear-stress theory predicts yielding when τmax=σ1−σ3 2≥Sy 2or σ1−σ3≥Sy (5–1) Note that this implies that the yield strength in shear is given by Ssy=0.5Sy (5–2) which, as we will see later is about 15 percent low (conservative). For design purposes, Eq. (5–1) can be modiﬁed to incorporate a factor of safety, n. Thus, τmax=Sy 2nor σ1−σ3=Sy n(5–3) Plane stress is a very common state of stress in design. However, it is extremely important to realize that plane stress is a three-dimensional state of stress. Plane stress transformations in Sec. 3–6 are restricted to the in-plane stresses only, where the in- plane principal stresses are given by Eq. (3–13) and labeled as σ1and σ2. It is true that these are the principal stresses in the plane of analysis, but out of plane there is a third principal stress and it is always zero for plane stress. This means that if we are going to use the convention of ordering σ1≥σ2≥σ3for three-dimensional analysis, upon which Eq. (5–1) is based, we cannot arbitrarily call the in-plane principal stresses σ1 and σ2until we relate them with the third principal stress of zero. To illustrate the MSS theory graphically for plane stress, we will ﬁrst label the principal stresses given by Eq. (3–13) as σAand σB, and then order them with the zero principal stress according to the convention σ1≥σ2≥σ3. Assuming that σA≥σB, there are three cases to con- sider when using Eq. (5–1) for plane stress: Case 1: σA≥σB≥0. For this case, σ1=σAand σ3=0. Equation (5–1) reduces to a yield condition of σA≥Sy (5–4) Case 2: σA≥0≥σB. Here, σ1=σAand σ3=σB, and Eq. (5–1) becomes σA−σB≥Sy (5–5) Case 3: 0≥σA≥σB. For this case, σ1=0and σ3=σB, and Eq. (5–1) gives σB≤−Sy (5–6) Equations (5–4) to (5–6) are represented in Fig. 5–7 by the three lines indicated in the σA,σBplane. The remaining unmarked lines are cases for σB≥σA,which completes the stress yield envelope but are not normally used. The maximum-shear-stress theory predicts yield if a stress state is outside the shaded region bordered by the stress yield envelope. In Fig. 5–7, suppose point arepresents the stress state of a critical stress elementbud29281_ch05_212-264.qxd 11/27/2009 6:46 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Failures Resulting from Static Loading 221 of a member. If the load is increased, it is typical to assume that the principal stresses will increase proportionally along the line from the origin through point a. Such a load lineis shown. If the stress situation increases along the load line until it crosses the stress failure envelope, such as at point b, the MSS theory predicts that the stress ele- ment will yield. The factor of safety guarding against yield at point ais given by the ratio of strength (distance to failure at point b) to stress (distance to stress at point a), that is n=Ob/Oa. Note that the ﬁrst part of Eq. (5–3), τmax=Sy/2n, is sufﬁcient for design purposes provided the designer is careful in determining τmax. For plane stress, Eq. (3–14) does not always predict τmax. However, consider the special case when one normal stress is zero in the plane, say σxand τxyhave values and σy=0. It can be easily shown that this is a Case 2 problem, and the shear stress determined by Eq. (3–14) isτmax. Shaft design problems typically fall into this category where a normal stress exists from bending and/or axial loading, and a shear stress arises from torsion. 5–5 Distortion-Energy Theory for Ductile Materials The distortion-energy theory predicts that yielding occurs when the distortion strain energy per unit volume reaches or exceeds the distortion strain energy per unit volume for yield in simple tension or compression of the same material . The distortion-energy (DE) theory originated from the observation that ductile materials stressed hydrostatically (equal principal stresses) exhibited yield strengths greatly in excess of the values given by the simple tension test. Therefore it was postu- lated that yielding was not a simple tensile or compressive phenomenon at all, but, rather, that it was related somehow to the angular distortion of the stressed element. To develop the theory, note, in Fig. 5–8 a, the unit volume subjected to any three- dimensional stress state designated by the stresses σ1, σ2,and σ3. The stress state shown in Fig. 5–8 bis one of hydrostatic normal stresses due to the stresses σavacting in each of the same principal directions as in Fig. 5–8 a. The formula for σavis simply σav=σ1+σ2+σ3 3(a) Thus the element in Fig. 5–8 bundergoes pure volume change, that is, no angular dis- tortion. If we regard σavas a component of σ1, σ2, and σ3, then this component can be subtracted from them, resulting in the stress state shown in Fig. 5–8 c. This element is subjected to pure angular distortion, that is, no volume change.ab O/H9268B /H9268ALoad lineCase 1 Case 2Nonyield region Case 3–Sy–SySy SyFigure 5–7 The maximum-shear-stress (MSS) theory yield envelope for plane stress, where σAand σBare the two nonzero principal stresses.bud29281_ch05_212-264.qxd 11/27/2009 6:46 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:222 Mechanical Engineering Design The strain energy per unit volume for simple tension is u=1 2/epsilon1σ.

There are eight surfaces symmetric to the principal directions that contain this stress. This forms an octahedron as shown in Fig. 5–10. The shear stresses on these surfaces are equal and are called the octahedral shear stresses (Fig. 5–10 has only one of the octahedral surfaces labeled). Through coordinate trans- formations the octahedral shear stress is given by5 τoct=1 3/bracketleftbig (σ1−σ2)2+(σ2−σ3)2+(σ3−σ1)2/bracketrightbig1/2(5–16) Under the name of the octahedral-shear-stress theory, failure is assumed to occur when- ever the octahedral shear stress for any stress state equals or exceeds the octahedral shear stress for the simple tension-test specimen at failure. As before, on the basis of the tensile test results, yield occurs when σ1=Syand σ2=σ3=0. From Eq. (5–16) the octahedral shear stress under this condition is τoct=√ 2 3Sy (5–17) When, for the general stress case, Eq. (5–16) is equal or greater than Eq. (5–17), yield is predicted. This reduces to /bracketleftbigg(σ1−σ2)2+(σ2−σ3)2+(σ3−σ1)2 2/bracketrightbigg1/2 ≥Sy (5–18) which is identical to Eq. (5–10), verifying that the maximum-octahedral-shear-stress theory is equivalent to the distortion-energy theory. The model for the MSS theory ignores the contribution of the normal stresses on the 45° surfaces of the tensile specimen. However, these stresses are P/2A, and notthe hydrostatic stresses which are P/3A. Herein lies the difference between the MSS and DE theories. The mathematical manipulation involved in describing the DE theory might tend to obscure the real value and usefulness of the result. The equations given allow the most complicated stress situation to be represented by a single quantity, the von Mises stress, which then can be compared against the yield strength of the material through Eq. (5–11). This equation can be expressed as a design equation by σ/prime=Sy n(5–19)Figure 5–10 Octahedral surfaces./H92682 /H92681 /H92683/H9270oct/H9268av 5For a derivation, see Arthur P.

Hence, it is the most widely used theory for duc- tile materials and is recommended for design problems unless otherwise speciﬁed. One ﬁnal note concerns the shear yield strength. Consider a case of pure shear τxy, where for plane stress σx=σy=0.For yield, Eq. (5–11) with Eq. (5–15) gives /parenleftbig 3τ2 xy/parenrightbig1/2=Sy or τxy=Sy√ 3=0.577Sy (5–20) Thus, the shear yield strength predicted by the distortion-energy theory is Ssy=0.577Sy (5–21) which as stated earlier, is about 15 percent greater than the 0.5 Sypredicted by the MSS theory. For pure shear, τxythe principal stresses from Eq. (3–13) are σA=−σB=τxy. The load line for this case is in the third quadrant at an angle of 45ofrom the σA,σB axes shown in Fig. 5–9.

Both will be used for comparison. Note that cases ato dare plane stress states. (a) Since there is no shear stress on this stress element, the normal stresses are equal to the principal stresses.

For example, the yield strength of magnesium alloys in compression may be as little as 50 percent of their yield strength in tension. The ultimate strength of gray cast irons in compression varies from 3 to 4 times greater than the ultimate tensile strength. So, in this section, we are primarily interested in those theories that can be used to predict failure for materials whose strengths in tension and compression are not equal. Historically, the Mohr theory of failure dates to 1900, a date that is relevant to its presentation. There were no computers, just slide rules, compasses, and French curves. Graphical procedures, common then, are still useful today for visualization. The idea of Mohr is based on three “simple” tests: tension, compression, and shear, to yielding if the material can yield, or to rupture. It is easier to deﬁne shear yield strength as Ssythan it is to test for it. The practical difﬁculties aside, Mohr’s hypothesis was to use the results of tensile, compressive, and torsional shear tests to construct the three circles of Fig. 5–12 deﬁning a failure envelope tangent to the three circles, depicted as curve ABCDE in the ﬁgure. The argument amounted to the three Mohr circles describing the stress state in a body (see Fig. 3–12) growing during loading until one of them became tan- gent to the failure envelope, thereby deﬁning failure. Was the form of the failure enve- lope straight, circular, or quadratic? A compass or a French curve deﬁned the failure envelope. A variation of Mohr’s theory, called the Coulomb-Mohr theory or the internal-friction theory, assumes that the boundary BCD in Fig. 5–12 is straight. With this assumption only the tensile and compressive strengths are necessary . Consider the co nventional ordering of the principal stresses such that σ1≥σ2≥σ3. The largest circle connects σ1andσ3,a s shown in Fig. 5–13. The centers of the circles in Fig. 5–13 are C1, C2, and C3.

The distance from the origin to C1is St/2, to C3is Sc/2, and to C2(in the positive σdirection) is (σ1+σ3)/2. Thus σ1−σ3 2−St 2 St 2−σ1+σ3 2=Sc 2−St 2 St 2+Sc 2 Canceling the 2 in each term, cross-multiplying, and simplifying reduces this equa- tion to σ1 St−σ3 Sc=1 (5–22) where either yield strength or ultimate strength can be used. For plane stress, when the two nonzero principal stresses are σA≥σB, we have a situation similar to the three cases given for the MSS theory, Eqs. (5–4) to (5–6). That is, the failure conditions are Case 1: σA≥σB≥0. For this case, σ1=σAand σ3=0. Equation (5–22) reduces to σA≥St (5–23) Case 2: σA≥0≥σB. Here, σ1=σAand σ3=σB, and Eq. (5–22) becomes σA St−σB Sc≥1 (5–24) Case 3: 0≥σA≥σB. For this case, σ1=0and σ3=σB, and Eq.

In this section we limit our studies to materials and parts that are known to fail in a ductile manner. Materials that fail in a brit- tle manner will be considered separately because these require different failure theories. To help decide on appropriate and workable theories of failure, Marin6collected data from many sources. Some of the data points used to select failure theories for duc- tile materials are shown in Fig. 5–15.7Mann also collected many data for copper and nickel alloys; if shown, the data points for these would be mingled with those already diagrammed. Figure 5–15 shows that either the maximum-shear-stress theory or the distortion-energy theory is acceptable for design and analysis of materials that would fail in a ductile manner. The selection of one or the other of these two theories is something that you, the engineer, must decide. For design purposes the maximum-shear-stress theory is easy, quick to use, and conservative. If the problem is to learn why a part failed, then the distortion-energy theory may be the best to use; Fig. 5–15 shows that the plot of the distortion-energy theory passes closer to the central area of the data points, and thus is generally a better predictor of failure. However, keep in mind that though a failure curve passing through the center of the experimental data is typical of the data, its reliability from a statistical standpoint is about 50 percent. For design purposes, a larger factor of safety may be warranted when using such a failure theory. Figure 5–15 Experimental data superposed on failure theories.

He has published many books and papers on the subject. Here the reference used is Joseph Marin, Engineering Materials, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1952. (See pp. 156 and 157 for some data points used here.) 7Note that some data in Fig. 5–15 are displayed along the top horizontal boundary where σB≥σA. This is often done with failure data to thin out congested data points by plotting on the mirror image of the line σB=σA.bud29281_ch05_212-264.qxd 11/27/2009 6:46 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:232 Mechanical Engineering Design EXAMPLE 5–3 This example illustrates the use of a failure theory to determine the strength of a mechan- ical element or component. The example may also clear up any confusion existing between the phrases strength of a machine part, strength of a material, and strength of a part at a point. A certain force Fapplied at Dnear the end of the 15-in lever shown in Fig. 5–16, which is quite similar to a socket wrench, results in certain stresses in the cantilevered bar OABC . This bar ( OABC ) is of AISI 1035 steel, forged and heat-treated so that it has a minimum (ASTM) yield strength of 81 kpsi. We presume that this component would be of no value after yielding. Thus the force Frequired to initiate yielding can be regarded as the strength of the component part. Find this force. Solution We will assume that lever DCis strong enough and hence not a part of the problem. A 1035 steel, heat-treated, will have a reduction in area of 50 percent or more and hence is a duc- tile material at normal temperatures. This also means that stress concentration at shoulder Aneed not be considered. A stress element at Aon the top surface will be subjected to a tensile bending stress and a torsional stress. This point, on the 1-in-diameter section, is the weakest section, and governs the strength of the assembly. The two stresses are σx=M I/c=32M πd3=32(14F) π(13)=142.6F τzx=Tr J=16T πd3=16(15F) π(13)=76.4F A 1 8-in R.11 2-in D. 11 2-in D.z 1-in D.2 in 2 in 15 in FB C xOy D12 inFigure 5–16For ductile materials with unequal yield strengths, Sytin tension and Sycin com- pression, the Mohr theory is the best available. However, the theory requires the results from three separate modes of tests, graphical construction of the failure locus, and ﬁt- ting the largest Mohr’s circle to the failure locus. The alternative to this is to use the Coulomb-Mohr theory, which requires only the tensile and compressive yield strengths and is easily dealt with in equation form.bud29281_ch05_212-264.qxd 11/27/2009 6:46 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Failures Resulting from Static Loading 233 Employing the distortion-energy theory, we ﬁnd, from Eq.

The strength of the assembly or component is F=416lbf. Let us apply the MSS theory for comparison. For a point undergoing plane stress with only one nonzero normal stress and one shear stress, the two nonzero principal stresses will have opposite signs, and hence the maximum shear stress is obtained from the Mohr’s circle between them.

(5–3) with n=1, and solving for F, we get F=81 000 /2 104.5=388 lbf which is about 7 percent less than found for the DE theory. As stated earlier, the MSS theory is more conservative than the DE theory. EXAMPLE 5–4 The cantilevered tube shown in Fig. 5–17 is to be made of 2014 aluminum alloy treated to obtain a speciﬁed minimum yield strength of 276 MPa. We wish to select a stock-size tube from Table A–8 using a design factor nd=4. The bending load is F=1.75kN, the axial tension is P=9.0kN, and the torsion is T=72 N·m.What is the realized factor of safety? Solution The critical stress element is at point Aon the top surface at the wall, where the bend- ing moment is the largest, and the bending and torsional stresses are at their maximum values. The critical stress element is shown in Fig. 5–17 b. Since the axial stress and bending stress are both in tension along the xaxis, they are additive for the normal stress, giving σx=P A+Mc I=9 A+120(1.75)(do/2) I=9 A+105do I(1) where, if millimeters are used for the area properties, the stress is in gigapascals. The torsional stress at the same point is τzx=Tr J=72(do/2) J=36do J(2)bud29281_ch05_212-264.qxd 11/27/2009 6:46 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:234 Mechanical Engineering Design For accuracy, we choose the distortion-energy theory as the design basis. The von Mises stress from Eq.

(1) and (2). Programming Eqs. (1) to (3) on a spreadsheet and entering metric sizes from Table A–8 reveals that a 42×5-mm tube is satisfactory. The von Mises stress is found to be σ/prime=0.06043 GPa for this size. Thus the realized factor of safety is Answer n=Sy σ/prime=0.276 0.06043=4.57 For the next size smaller, a 42×4-mm tube, σ/prime=0.07105 GPa giving a factor of safety of n=Sy σ/prime=0.276 0.07105=3.88Figure 5–17 120 mmy zF T xPA (a) (b)/H9270zx /H9268x zxbud29281_ch05_212-264.qxd 11/27/2009 6:46 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Failures Resulting from Static Loading 235 5–8 Maximum-Normal-Stress Theory for Brittle Materials The maximum-normal-stress (MNS) theory states that failure occurs whenever one of the three principal stresses equals or exceeds the strength . Again we arrange the prin- cipal stresses for a general stress state in the ordered form σ1≥σ2≥σ3. This theory then predicts that failure occurs whenever σ1≥Sut or σ3≤−Suc (5–28) where Sutand Sucare the ultimate tensile and compressive strengths, respectively, given as positive quantities. For plane stress, with the principal stresses given by Eq. (3–13), with σA≥σB, Eq. (5–28) can be written as σA≥Sut or σB≤−Suc (5–29) which is plotted in Fig. 5–18. As before, the failure criteria equations can be converted to design equations. We can consider two sets of equations where σA≥σBas σA=Sut nor σB=−Suc n(5–30) As will be seen later, the maximum-normal-stress theory is not very good at pre- dicting failure in the fourth quadrant of the σA, σBplane. Thus, we will not recommend the theory for use. It has been included here mainly for historical reasons. 5–9 Modiﬁcations of the Mohr Theory for Brittle Materials We will discuss two modiﬁcations of the Mohr theory for brittle materials: the Brittle- Coulomb-Mohr (BCM) theory and the modiﬁed Mohr (MM) theory. The equations provided for the theories will be restricted to plane stress and be of the design type incorporating the factor of safety.Figure 5–18 Graph of maximum-normal- stress (MNS) theory failure envelope for plane stress states.Sut/H9268B /H9268ASut –Suc –SucNonfailure regionbud29281_ch05_212-264.qxd 11/27/2009 9:05 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:236 Mechanical Engineering Design The Coulomb-Mohr theory was discussed earlier in Sec. 5–6 with Eqs.

(b) Modiﬁed Mohr failure model. Solution We assume that the lever DCis strong enough, and not part of the problem. Since grade 30 cast iron is a brittle material andcast iron, the stress-concentration factors KtandKts are set to unity. From Table A–24, the tensile ultimate strength is 31 kpsi and the com- pressive ultimate strength is 109 kpsi. The stress element at Aon the top surface will be subjected to a tensile bending stress and a torsional stress. This location, on the 1-in- diameter section ﬁllet, is the weakest location, and it governs the strength of the assem- bly.

We also have to be aware of normally ductile materials that for some reason may develop a brittle fracture or crack if used below the transition tempera- ture. Figure 5–20 shows data for a nominal grade 30 cast iron taken under biaxial stress conditions, with several brittle failure hypotheses shown, superposed. We note the following: •In the ﬁrst quadrant the data appear on both sides and along the failure curves of maximum-normal-stress, Coulomb-Mohr, and modiﬁed Mohr. All failure curves are the same, and data ﬁt well. •In the fourth quadrant the modiﬁed Mohr theory represents the data best, whereas the maximum-normal-stress theory does not. •In the third quadrant the points A, B, C, and Dare too few to make any suggestion concerning a fracture locus. 5–11 Selection of Failure Criteria For ductile behavior the preferred criterion is the distortion-energy theory, although some designers also apply the maximum-shear-stress theory because of its simplicity and conservative nature. In the rare case when Syt/negationslash=Syc, the ductile Coulomb-Mohr method is employed. For brittle behavior, the original Mohr hypothesis, constructed with tensile, compres- sion, and torsion tests, with a curved failure locus is the best hypothesis we have. However, the difﬁculty of applying it without a computer leads engineers to choose modiﬁcations,Figure 5–20 A plot of experimental data points obtained from tests on cast iron. Shown also are the graphs of three failure theories of possible usefulness for brittle materials. Note points A, B, C, and D. To avoid congestion in the ﬁrst quadrant, points have been plotted for σA>σ Bas well as for the opposite sense. (Source of data: Charles F .

Figure 5–21 provides a summary ﬂowchart for the selection of an effective procedure for analyzing or predicting failures from static loading for brittle or ductile behavior. Note that the maximum-normal-stress theory is excluded from Fig. 5–21 as the other theories better represent the experimental data. 5–12 Introduction to Fracture Mechanics The idea that cracks exist in parts even before service begins, and that cracks can grow during service, has led to the descriptive phrase “damage-tolerant design.” The focus of this philosophy is on crack growth until it becomes critical, and the part is removed from service. The analysis tool is linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). Inspection and maintenance are essential in the decision to retire parts before cracks reach cata- strophic size. Where human safety is concerned, periodic inspections for cracks are mandated by codes and government ordinance. We shall now brieﬂy examine some of the basic ideas and vocabulary needed for the potential of the approach to be appreciated. The intent here is to make the reader aware of the dangers associated with the sudden brittle fracture of so-called ductile materials. The topic is much too extensive to include in detail here and the reader is urged to read further on this complex subject.9Figure 5–21 Failure theory selection ﬂowchart. 9References on brittle fracture include: H.

However, stress-concentration factors are limited to structures for which all dimensions are precisely known, particularly the radius of curvature in regions of high stress con- centration. When there exists a crack, ﬂaw, inclusion, or defect of unknown small radius in a part, the elastic stress-concentration factor approaches inﬁnity as the root radius approaches zero, thus rendering the stress-concentration factor approach useless. Furthermore, even if the radius of curvature of the ﬂaw tip is known, the high local stresses there will lead to local plastic deformation surrounded by a region of elastic deformation. Elastic stress-concentration factors are no longer valid for this situation, so analysis from the point of view of stress-concentration factors does not lead to cri- teria useful for design when very sharp cracks are present. By combining analysis of the gross elastic changes in a structure or part that occur as a sharp brittle crack grows with measurements of the energy required to produce new fracture surfaces, it is possible to calculate the average stress (if no crack were present) that will cause crack growth in a part. Such calculation is possible only for parts with cracks for which the elastic analysis has been completed, and for materials that crack in a relatively brittle manner and for which the fracture energy has been carefully measured. The term relatively brittle is rigorously deﬁned in the test procedures,10but it means, roughly, fracture without yielding occurring throughout the fractured cross section . Thus glass, hard steels, strong aluminum alloys, and even low-carbon steel below the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature can be analyzed in this way. Fortunately, ductile materials blunt sharp cracks, as we have previously discovered, so that fracture occurs at average stresses of the order of the yield strength, and the designer is prepared for this condition. The middle ground of materials that lie between “relatively brittle” and “ductile” is now being actively analyzed, but exact design criteria for these materi- als are not yet available. Quasi-Static Fracture Many of us have had the experience of observing brittle fracture, whether it is the break- ing of a cast-iron specimen in a tensile test or the twist fracture of a piece of blackboard chalk. It happens so rapidly that we think of it as instantaneous, that is, the cross section simply parting. Fewer of us have skated on a frozen pond in the spring, with no one near us, heard a cracking noise, and stopped to observe. The noise is due to cracking. The cracks move slowly enough for us to see them run. The phenomenon is not instantaneous, since some time is necessary to feed the crack energy from the stress ﬁeld to the crack for propagation. Quantifying these things is important to understanding the phenomenon “in the small.” In the large, a static crack may be stable and will not propagate. Some level of loading can render the crack unstable, and the crack propagates to fracture. The foundation of fracture mechanics was ﬁrst established by Grifﬁth in 1921 using the stress ﬁeld calculations for an elliptical ﬂaw in a plate developed by Inglis in For the inﬁnite plate loaded by an applied uniaxial stress σin Fig. 5–22, the max- imum stress occurs at ( ±a, 0) and is given by (σy)max=/parenleftbigg 1+2a b/parenrightbigg σ (5–33) 10BS 5447:1977 and ASTM E399-78.bud29281_ch05_212-264.qxd 11/27/2009 6:46 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Failures Resulting from Static Loading 241 Note that when a=b, the ellipse becomes a circle and Eq. (5–33) gives a stress- concentration factor of 3. This agrees with the well-known result for an inﬁnite plate with a circular hole (see Table A–15–1). For a ﬁne crack, b/a→0, and Eq. (5–34) predicts that (σy)max→∞ . However, on a microscopic level, an inﬁnitely sharp crack is a hypothetical abstraction that is physically impossible, and when plastic deformation occurs, the stress will be ﬁnite at the crack tip. Grifﬁth showed that the crack growth occurs when the energy release rate from applied loading is greater than the rate of energy for crack growth. Crack growth can be stable or unstable. Unstable crack growth occurs when the rateof change of the energy release rate relative to the crack length is equal to or greater than the rateof change of the crack growth rate of energy. Grifﬁth’s experimental work was restricted to brittle materials, namely glass, which pretty much conﬁrmed his surface energy hypothesis. However, for ductile materials, the energy needed to perform plastic work at the crack tip is found to be much more crucial than surface energy. Crack Modes and the Stress Intensity Factor Three distinct modes of crack propagation exist, as shown in Fig. 5–23. A tensile stress ﬁeld gives rise to mode I, the opening crack propagation mode, as shown in Fig. 5–23 a. This mode is the most common in practice. Mode II is the sliding mode, is due to in-plane shear, and can be seen in Fig. 5–23 b. Mode III is the tearing mode, which arises from out-of-plane shear, as shown in Fig. 5–23 c. Combinations of these modes can also occur.

The quantity σy|θ=0√ 2r=σ√a,however, does remain constant as r→0.It is common practice to deﬁne a factor Kcalled the stress intensity factor given by K=σ√πa (b) where the units are MPa√mor kpsi√ in. Since we are dealing with a mode I crack, Eq. ( b) is written as KI=σ√πa (5–35) The stress intensity factor is notto be confused with the static stress-concentration factors Ktand Ktsdeﬁned in Secs. 3–13 and 5–2. Thus Eqs.

The critical stress intensity factor KIcis a material property that depends on the material, crack m ode, processing of the material, temper- ature, loading rate, and the state of stress at the crack site (such as plane stress versus plane strain). The critical stress intensity factor KIcis also called the fracture toughness of the material. The fracture toughness for plane strain is normally lower than that for plane stress. For this reason, the term KIcis typically deﬁned as the mode I, plane strain fracture toughness . Fracture toughness KIcfor engineering metals lies in the range 20≤KIc≤200 MPa ·√m; for engineering polymers and ceramics, 1≤KIc≤ 5MPa·√m. For a 4340 steel, where the yield strength due to heat treatment ranges from 800 to 1600 MPa, KIcdecreases from 190 to 40 MPa ·√m. Table 5–1 gives some approximate typical room-temperature values of KIcfor several materials. As previously noted, the fracture toughness depends on many factors and the table is meant only to convey some typical magnitudes of KIc.For an actual application, it is recommended that the material speciﬁed for the application be certi- ﬁed using standard test procedures [see the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard E399].bud29281_ch05_212-264.qxd 11/27/2009 6:46 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:246 Mechanical Engineering Design Table 5–1 Values of KIcfor Some Engineering Materials at Room TemperatureMaterial KIc, MPa√ Aluminum 2024 26 455 7075 24 495 7178 33 490 Titanium Ti-6AL-4V 115 910 Ti-6AL-4V 55 1035 Steel 4340 99 860 4340 60 1515 52100 14 2070One of the ﬁrst problems facing the designer is that of deciding whether the condi- tions exist, or not, for a brittle fracture. Low-temperature operation, that is, operation below room temperature, is a key indicator that brittle fracture is a possible failure mode. Tables of transition temperatures for various materials have not been published, possibly because of the wide variation in values, even for a single material. Thus, in many situations, laboratory testing may give the only clue to the possibility of a brittle fracture. Another key indicator of the possibility of fracture is the ratio of the yield strength to the ultimate strength. A high ratio of Sy/Suindicates there is only a smallFigure 5–30 Cylinder subjected to internal pressure p, having a radial crack in the longitudinal direction of depth a. Use Eq.

The strength-to-stress ratio KIc/KIcan be used as a factor of safety as n=KIc KI(5–38) EXAMPLE 5–6 A steel ship deck plate is 30 mm thick and 12 m wide. It is loaded with a nominal uni- axial tensile stress of 50 MPa. It is operated below its ductile-to-brittle transition tem- perature with KIcequal to 28.3 MPa. If a 65-mm-long central transverse crack is present, estimate the tensile stress at which catastrophic failure will occur. Compare this stress with the yield strength of 240 MPa for this steel. Solution For Fig. 5–25, with d=b,2a=65 mm and 2 b=12 m , so that d/b=1and a/d= 65/12(103)=0.00542.Since a/dis so small, β=1,so that KI=σ√πa=50/radicalbig π(32.5×10−3)=16.0M P a√m From Eq. (5–38), n=KIc KI=28.3 16.0=1.77 The stress at which catastrophic failure occurs is Answer σc=KIc KIσ=28.3 16.0(50)=88.4M P a The yield strength is 240 MPa, and catastrophic failure occurs at 88.4/240=0.37,or at 37 percent of yield. The factor of safety in this circumstance is KIc/KI= 28.3/16=1.77and not240/50=4.8. EXAMPLE 5–7 A plate of width 1.4 m and length 2.8 m is required to support a tensile force in the 2.8-m direction of 4.0 MN. Inspection procedures will detect only through-thickness edge cracks larger than 2.7 mm. The two Ti-6AL-4V alloys in Table 5–1 are being con- sidered for this application, for which the safety factor must be 1.3 and minimum weight is important. Which alloy should be used? Solution (a) We elect ﬁrst to estimate the thickness required to resist yielding. Since σ=P/wt, we have t=P/wσ. For the weaker alloy, we have, from Table 5–1, Sy=910 MPa . Thus, σall=Sy n=910 1.3=700 MPa Thus t=P wσall=4.0(10)3 1.4(700)=4.08 mm or greaterbud29281_ch05_212-264.qxd 11/27/2009 6:46 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:For the stronger alloy, we have, from Table 5–1, σall=1035 1.3=796 MPa and so the thickness is Answer t=P wσall=4.0(10)3 1.4(796)=3.59 mm or greater (b) Now let us ﬁnd the thickness required to prevent crack growth. Using Fig. 5–26, we have h b=2.8/2 1.4=1a b=2.7 1.4(103)=0.001 93 Corresponding to these ratios we ﬁnd from Fig. 5–26 that β.=1.1,andKI=1.1σ√πa. n=KIc KI=115√ 103 1.1σ√πa,σ =KIc 1.1n√πa From Table 5–1, KIc=115 MPa√mfor the weaker of the two alloys. Solving for σwith n=1gives the fracture stress σ=115 1.1/radicalbig π(2.7×10−3)=1135 MPa which is greater than the yield strength of 910 MPa, and so yield strength is the basis for the geometry decision. For the stronger alloy Sy=1035 MPa, with n=1the frac- ture stress is σ=KIc nK I=55 1(1.1)/radicalbig π(2.7×10−3)=542.9 MPa which is less than the yield strength of 1035 MPa. The thickness tis t=P wσall=4.0(103) 1.4(542.9/1.3)=6.84 mm or greater This example shows that the fracture toughness KIclimits the geometry when the stronger alloy is used, and so a thickness of 6.84 mm or larger is required. When the weaker alloy is used the geometry is limited by the yield strength, giving a thickness of only 4.08 mm or greater. Thus the weaker alloy leads to a thinner and lighter weight choice since the failure modes differ.248 Mechanical Engineering Design 12Review Chap. 20 before reading this section.5–13 Stochastic Analysis12 Reliability is the probability that machine systems and components will perform their intended function satisfactorily without failure. Up to this point, discussion in this chap- ter has been restricted to deterministic relations between static stress, strength, and the design factor. Stress and strength, however, are statistical in nature and very much tied to the reliability of the stressed component. Consider the probability density functionsbud29281_ch05_212-264.qxd 11/27/2009 6:46 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Failures Resulting from Static Loading 249 S (a)f(s), f(/H9268)/H9268 /H9262/H9268 /H9262s Stress m R (b)f(m) /H9262m Stress margin0(1 – R) –/H11009 +/H11009 for stress and strength, /H9268and S, shown in Fig. 5–31 a.

Here, the “average” factor of safety is ¯n=μS μσ(a) The margin of safety for any value of stress σand strength Sis deﬁned as m=S−σ (b) The average part will have a margin of safety of ¯m=μS−μσ.However, for the over- lap of the distributions shown by the shaded area in Fig. 5–31 a, the stress exceeds the strength, the margin of safety is negative, and these parts are expected to fail. This shaded area is called the interference of /H9268and S. Figure 5–31 bshows the distribution of m, which obviously depends on the distri- butions of stress and strength. The reliability that a part will perform without failure, R, is the area of the margin of safety distribution for m>0.The interference is the area 1−Rwhere parts are expected to fail. We next consider some typical cases involving stress-strength interference. Normal-Normal Case Consider the normal distributions, S=N(μS,ˆσS)and /H9268=N(μσ,ˆσσ). The stress margin is m=S−/H9268,and will be normally distributed because the addition or sub- traction of normals is normal. Thus m=N(μm,ˆσm). Reliability is the probability pthat m>0. That is, R=p(S>σ)=p(S−σ> 0)=p(m>0) (5–39) To ﬁnd the chance that m>0we form the zvariable of mand substitute m=0[See Eq. (20–16)]. Noting that μm=μS−μσand ˆσm=(ˆσ2 S+ˆσ2 σ)1/2, we write z=m−μm ˆσm=0−μm ˆσm=−μm ˆσm=−μS−μσ/parenleftbig ˆσ2 S+ˆσ2σ/parenrightbig1/2(5–40)Figure 5–31 Plot of density functions showing how the interference of Sand /H9268is used to obtain the stress margin m.

The CSdepends slightly on the particular material. The Cσhas the coefﬁcient of variation (COV) of the load, and that is gen- erally given.

Sometimes, however, it turns out that the strength has, say, a Weibull distribution while the stress is distributed lognormally. In fact, stresses are quite likely to have a lognormal distribution, because the multiplication of variates that are normally distributed produces a result that approaches lognormal. What all this means is that we must expect to encounter interference problems involving mixed distributions and we need a general method to handle the problem. It is quite likely that we will use interference theory for problems involving distri- butions other than strength and stress. For this reason we employ the subscript 1 to designate the strength distribution and the subscript 2 to designate the stress distribu- tion. Figure 5–32 shows these two distributions aligned so that a single cursor xcan be used to identify points on both distributions. We can now write /parenleftBiggProbability that stress is less than strength/parenrightBigg =dp(σ < x)=dR=F2(x)dF1(x) By substituting 1−R2for F2and −dR1for dF1, we have dR=−[1−R2(x)]dR1(x) The reliability for all possible locations of the cursor is obtained by integrating x from−∞ to ∞; but this corresponds to an integration from 1 to 0 on the reliability R1.

The behavior of machine parts is entirely different when they are subjected to time- varying loading. In this chapter we shall examine how parts fail under variable loading and how to proportion them to successfully resist such conditions. 6–1 Introduction to Fatigue in Metals In most testing of those properties of materials that relate to the stress-strain diagram, the load is applied gradually, to give sufﬁcient time for the strain to fully develop. Furthermore, the specimen is tested to destruction, and so the stresses are applied only once. Testing of this kind is applicable, to what are known as static conditions; such conditions closely approximate the actual conditions to which many structural and machine members are subjected. The condition frequently arises, however, in which the stresses vary with time or they ﬂuctuate between different levels. For example, a particular ﬁber on the surface of a rotating shaft subjected to the action of bending loads undergoes both tension and com- pression for each revolution of the shaft. If the shaft is part of an electric motor rotating at 1725 rev/min, the ﬁber is stressed in tension and compression 1725 times each minute. If, in addition, the shaft is also axially loaded (as it would be, for example, by a helical or worm gear), an axial component of stress is superposed upon the bending component. In this case, some stress is always present in any one ﬁber, but now the level of stress is ﬂuctuating. These and other kinds of loading occurring in machine members produce stresses that are called variable, repeated, alternating, orﬂuctuating stresses. Often, machine members are found to have failed under the action of repeated or ﬂuctuating stresses; yet the most careful analysis reveals that the actual maximum stresses were well below the ultimate strength of the material, and quite frequently even below the yield strength. The most distinguishing characteristic of these failures is that the stresses have been repeated a very large number of times. Hence the failure is called a fatigue failure . When machine parts fail statically, they usually develop a very large deﬂection, because the stress has exceeded the yield strength, and the part is replaced before fracture actually occurs. Thus many static failures give visible warning in advance. But a fatigue failure gives no warning! It is sudden and total, and hence dangerous. It is relatively sim- ple to design against a static failure, because our knowledge is comprehensive. Fatigue is a much more complicated phenomenon, only partially understood, and the engineer seek- ing competence must acquire as much knowledge of the subject as possible. A fatigue failure has an appearance similar to a brittle fracture, as the fracture sur- faces are ﬂat and perpendicular to the stress axis with the absence of necking. The frac- ture features of a fatigue failure, however, are quite different from a static brittle fracture arising from three stages of development. Stage I is the initiation of one or more micro- cracks due to cyclic plastic deformation followed by crystallographic propagation extending from two to ﬁve grains about the origin. Stage I cracks are not normally dis- cernible to the naked eye. Stage II progresses from microcracks to macrocracks forming parallel plateau-like fracture surfaces separated by longitudinal ridges. The plateaus are generally smooth and normal to the direction of maximum tensile stress. These surfaces can be wavy dark and light bands referred to as beach marks or clamshell marks, as seen in Fig. 6–1. During cyclic loading, these cracked surfaces open and close, rubbing together, and the beach mark appearance depends on the changes in the level or fre- quency of loading and the corrosive nature of the environment. Stage III occurs during the ﬁnal stress cycle when the remaining material cannot support the loads, resulting inbud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 11/30/2009 4:23 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Fatigue Failure Resulting from Variable Loading 267 Figure 6–1 Fatigue failure of a bolt due to repeated unidirectional bending.

A stage III fracture can be brittle, ductile, or a combination of both. Quite often the beach marks, if they exist, and possible patterns in the stage III frac- ture called chevron lines, point toward the origins of the initial cracks. There is a good deal to be learned from the fracture patterns of a fatigue failure.1 Figure 6–2 shows representations of failure surfaces of various part geometries under differing load conditions and levels of stress concentration. Note that, in the case of rotational bending, even the direction of rotation inﬂuences the failure pattern. Fatigue failure is due to crack formation and propagation. A fatigue crack will typ- ically initiate at a discontinuity in the material where the cyclic stress is a maximum. Discontinuities can arise because of: •Design of rapid changes in cross section, keyways, holes, etc. where stress concen- trations occur as discussed in Secs. 3–13 and 5–2. •Elements that roll and/or slide against each other (bearings, gears, cams, etc.) under high contact pressure, developing concentrated subsurface contact stresses (Sec. 3–19) that can cause surface pitting or spalling after many cycles of the load. •Carelessness in locations of stamp marks, tool marks, scratches, and burrs; poor joint design; improper assembly; and other fabrication faults. •Composition of the material itself as processed by rolling, forging, casting, extrusion, drawing, heat treatment, etc. Microscopic and submicroscopic surface and subsurface discontinuities arise, such as inclusions of foreign material, alloy segregation, voids, hard precipitated particles, and crystal discontinuities. Various conditions that can accelerate crack initiation include residual tensile stresses, elevated temperatures, temperature cycling, a corrosive environment, and high-frequency cycling. The rate and direction of fatigue crack propagation is primarily controlled by local- ized stresses and by the structure of the material at the crack. However, as with crack formation, other factors may exert a signiﬁcant inﬂuence, such as environment, tem- perature, and frequency. As stated earlier, cracks will grow along planes normal to thebud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 12/9/09 7:17PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:268 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 6–2 Schematics of fatigue fracture surfaces produced in smooth and notched components with round and rectangular cross sections under various loading conditions and nominal stress levels.

Figures 6–1 to 6–8, reproduced with permission from ASM International, are but a minuscule sample of examples of fatigue failures for a great variety of conditions included in the handbook. Comparing Fig. 6–3 with Fig. 6–2, we see that failure occurred by rotating bending stresses, with the direction of rotation being clockwise with respect to the view and with a mild stress concentration and low nominal stress.bud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 12/02/2009 6:49 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:270 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 6–5 Fatigue fracture surface of a forged connecting rod of AISI 8640 steel.

The methods of fatigue failure analysis represent a combi- nation of engineering and science. Often science fails to provide the complete answers that are needed. But the airplane must still be made to ﬂy—safely. And the automobile must be manufactured with a reliability that will ensure a long and troublefree life and at the same time produce proﬁts for the stockholders of the industry. Thus, while sci- ence has not yet completely explained the complete mechanism of fatigue, the engineer must still design things that will not fail. In a sense this is a classic example of the true meaning of engineering as contrasted with science. Engineers use science to solve their problems if the science is available. But available or not, the problem must be solved, and whatever form the solution takes under these conditions is called engineering . In this chapter, we will take a structured approach in the design against fatigue failure. As with static failure, we will attempt to relate to test results performed on sim- ply loaded specimens. However, because of the complex nature of fatigue, there is much more to account for. From this point, we will proceed methodically, and in stages. In an attempt to provide some insight as to what follows in this chapter, a brief descrip- tion of the remaining sections will be given here. Fatigue-Life Methods (Secs. 6–3 to 6–6) Three major approaches used in design and analysis to predict when, if ever, a cyclically loaded machine component will fail in fatigue over a period of time are presented. The premises of each approach are quite different but each adds to our understanding of the mechanisms associated with fatigue. The ap plication, advantages, and disadvantages of each method are indicated. Beyond Sec. 6–6, only one of the methods, the stress-life method, will be pursued for further design applications. Fatigue Strength and the Endurance Limit (Secs. 6–7 and 6–8) The strength-life ( S-N) diagram provides the fatigue strength Sfversus cycle life Nof a material. The results are generated from tests using a simple loading of standard laboratory- controlled specimens. The loading often is that of sinusoidally rev ersing pure bending. The laboratory-controlled specimens are polished without geometric stress concentra- tion at the region of minimum area. For steel and iron, the S-Ndiagram becomes horizontal at some point. The strength at this point is called the endurance limit S/prime eand occurs somewhere between 106and 107 cycles. The prime mark on S/prime erefers to the endurance limit of the controlled laboratory specimen . For nonferrous materials that do not exhibit an endurance limit, a fatigue strength at a speciﬁc number of cycles, S/prime f, may be given, where again, the prime denotes the fatigue strength of the laboratory-controlled specimen. The strength data are based on many controlled conditions that will not be the same as that for an actual machine part. What follows are practices used to account for the differences between the loading and physical conditions of the specimen and the actual machine part. Endurance Limit Modifying Factors (Sec. 6–9) Modifying factors are deﬁned and used to account for differences between the speci- men and the actual machine part with regard to surface conditions, size, loading, tem- perature, reliability, and miscellaneous factors. Loading is still considered to be simple and reversing.bud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 11/30/2009 4:23 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Fatigue Failure Resulting from Variable Loading 273 Stress Concentration and Notch Sensitivity (Sec. 6–10) The actual part may have a geometric stress concentration by which the fatigue behav- ior depends on the static stress-concentration factor and the component material’s sensitivity to fatigue damage. Fluctuating Stresses (Secs. 6–11 to 6–13) These sections account for simple stress states from ﬂuctuating load conditions that are not purely sinusoidally reversing axial, bending, or torsional stresses. Combinations of Loading Modes (Sec. 6–14) Here a procedure based on the distortion-energy theory is presented for analyzing combined ﬂuctuating stress states, such as combined bending and torsion. Here it is assumed that the levels of the ﬂuctuating stresses are in phase and not time varying. Varying, Fluctuating Stresses; Cumulative Fatigue Damage (Sec. 6–15) The ﬂuctuating stress levels on a machine part may be time varying. Methods are pro- vided to assess the fatigue damage on a cumulative basis. Remaining Sections The remaining three sections of the chapter pertain to the special topics of surface fatigue strength, stochastic analysis, and road maps with important equations. 6–3 Fatigue-Life Methods The three major fatigue life methods used in design and analysis are the stress-life method, the strain-life method, and the linear-elastic fracture mechanics method . These methods attempt to predict the life in number of cycles to failure, N, for a speciﬁc level of loading. Life of 1≤N≤103cycles is generally classiﬁed as low-cycle fatigue, whereas high-cycle fatigue is considered to be N>103cycles. The stress-life method, based on stress levels only, is the least accurate approach, especially for low-cycle applications. However, it is the most traditional method, since it is the easiest to implement for a wide range of design applications, has ample sup- porting data, and represents high-cycle applications adequately. The strain-life method involves more detailed analysis of the plastic deformation at localized regions where the stresses and strains are considered for life estimates. This method is especially good for low-cycle fatigue applications. In applying this method, several idealizations must be compounded, and so some uncertainties will exist in the results. For this reason, it will be discussed only because of its value in adding to the understanding of the nature of fatigue. The fracture mechanics method assumes a crack is already present and detected. It is then employed to predict crack growth with respect to stress intensity. It is most prac- tical when applied to large structures in conjunction with computer codes and a peri- odic inspection program. 6–4 The Stress-Life Method To determine the strength of materials under the action of fatigue loads, specimens are subjected to repeated or varying forces of speciﬁed magnitudes while the cycles or stress reversals are counted to destruction. The most widely used fatigue-testing devicebud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 12/7/09 7:25PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:274 Mechanical Engineering Design 7 163 0.30 in in 9in R.7 8a FFa FFFigure 6–9 Test-specimen geometry for the R.

This machine subjects the specimen to pure bending (no transverse shear) by means of weights. The specimen, shown in Fig. 6–9, is very carefully machined and polished, with a ﬁnal polishing in an axial direction to avoid circumferential scratches. Other fatigue-testing machines are avail- able for applying ﬂuctuating or reversed axial stresses, torsional stresses, or combined stresses to the test specimens. To establish the fatigue strength of a material, quite a number of tests are necessary because of the statistical nature of fatigue. For the rotating-beam test, a constant bend- ing load is applied, and the number of revolutions (stress reversals) of the beam required for failure is recorded. The ﬁrst test is made at a stress that is somewhat under the ulti- mate strength of the material. The second test is made at a stress that is less than that used in the ﬁrst. This process is continued, and the results are plotted as an S-Ndiagram (Fig. 6–10). This chart may be plotted on semilog paper or on log-log paper. In the case of ferrous metals and alloys, the graph becomes horizontal after the material has been stressed for a certain number of cycles. Plotting on log paper emphasizes the bend in the curve, which might not be apparent if the results were plotted by using Cartesian coordinates. The ordinate of the S-Ndiagram is called the fatigue strength Sf; a statement of this strength value must always be accompanied by a statement of the number of cycles Nto which it corresponds.bud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 12/02/2009 6:49 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Fatigue Failure Resulting from Variable Loading 275 80 70 60 50 40 35 30 25 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 7 6 5 103104105106107108109 Life N, cycles (log)Peak alternating bending stress S, kpsi (log) Sand castPermanent mold castWroughtFigure 6–11 S-Nbands for representative aluminum alloys, excluding wrought alloys with Sut<38kpsi. (From R. C. Juvinall, Engineering Considerations of Stress, Strain and Strength. Copyright © 1967 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Reprinted by permission.) Soon we shall learn that S-Ndiagrams can be determined either for a test specimen or for an actual mechanical element. Even when the material of the test specimen and that of the mechanical element are identical, there will be signiﬁcant differences between the diagrams for the two. In the case of the steels, a knee occurs in the graph, and beyond this knee failure will not occur, no matter how great the number of cycles. The strength corresponding to the knee is called the endurance limit Se, or the fatigue limit. The graph of Fig. 6–10 never does become horizontal for nonferrous metals and alloys, and hence these mate- rials do not have an endurance limit. Figure 6–11 shows scatter bands indicating the S-N curves for most common aluminum alloys excluding wrought alloys having a tensile strength below 38 kpsi. Since aluminum does not have an endurance limit, normally the fatigue strength Sfis reported at a speciﬁc number of cycles, normally N=5(108) cycles of reversed stress (see Table A–24). The S-Ndiagram is usually obtained by completely reversed stress cycles, in which the stress level alternates between equal magnitudes of tension and compression. We note that a stress cycle (N=1)constitutes a single application and removal of a load and then another application and removal of the load in the opposite direction. Thus N=1 2means the load is applied once and then removed, which is the case with the simple tension test. The body of knowledge available on fatigue failure from N=1to N=1000 cycles is generally classiﬁed as low-cycle fatigue, as indicated in Fig. 6–10. High-cycle fatigue, then, is concerned with failure corresponding to stress cycles greater than 103 cycles. We also distinguish a ﬁnite-life region and an inﬁnite-life region in Fig. 6–10. The boundary between these regions cannot be clearly deﬁned except for a speciﬁc material; but it lies somewhere between 106and 107cycles for steels, as shown in Fig. 6–10. As noted previously, it is always good engineering practice to conduct a testing program on the materials to be employed in design and manufacture. This, in fact, is a requirement, not an option, in guarding against the possibility of a fatigue failure.bud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 11/30/2009 4:23 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:276 Mechanical Engineering Design Because of this necessity for testing, it would really be unnecessary for us to proceed any further in the study of fatigue failure except for one important reason: the desire to know why fatigue failures occur so that the most effective method or methods can be used to improve fatigue strength . Thus our primary purpose in studying fatigue is to understand why failures occur so that we can guard against them in an optimum man- ner. For this reason, the analytical design approaches presented in this book, or in any other book, for that matter, do not yield absolutely precise results. The results should be taken as a guide, as something that indicates what is important and what is not impor- tant in designing against fatigue failure. As stated earlier, the stress-life method is the least accurate approach especially for low-cycle applications. However, it is the most traditional method, with much published data available. It is the easiest to implement for a wide range of design applications and represents high-cycle applications adequately. For these reasons the stress-life method will be emphasized in subsequent sections of this chapter. However, care should be exercised when applying the method for low-cycle applications, as the method does not account for the true stress-strain behavior when localized yielding occurs. 6–5 The Strain-Life Method The best approach yet advanced to explain the nature of fatigue failure is called by some the strain-life method. The approach can be used to estimate fatigue strengths, but when it is so used it is necessary to compound several idealizations, and so some uncertain- ties will exist in the results. For this reason, the method is presented here only because of its value in explaining the nature of fatigue. A fatigue failure almost always begins at a local discontinuity such as a notch, crack, or other area of stress concentration. When the stress at the discontinuity exceeds the elastic limit, plastic strain occurs. If a fatigue fracture is to occur, there must exist cyclic plastic strains. Thus we shall need to investigate the behavior of materials sub- ject to cyclic deformation. In 1910, Bairstow veriﬁed by experiment Bauschinger’s theory that the elastic lim- its of iron and steel can be changed, either up or down, by the cyclic variations of stress.2 In general, the elastic limits of annealed steels are likely to increase when subjected to cycles of stress reversals, while cold-drawn steels exhibit a decreasing elastic limit. R. W. Landgraf has investigated the low-cycle fatigue behavior of a large number of very high-strength steels, and during his research he made many cyclic stress-strain plots.3Figure 6–12 has been constructed to show the general appearance of these plots for the ﬁrst few cycles of controlled cyclic strain. In this case the strength decreases with stress repetitions, as evidenced by the fact that the reversals occur at ever-smaller stress levels. As previously noted, other materials may be strengthened, instead, by cyclic stress reversals. The SAE Fatigue Design and Evaluation Steering Committee released a report in 1975 in which the life in reversals to failure is related to the strain amplitude /Delta1ε/2.4 2L.

The report contains a plot of this relationship for SAE 1020 hot-rolled steel; the graph has been reproduced as Fig. 6–13. To explain the graph, we ﬁrst deﬁne the following terms: •Fatigue ductility coefﬁcient ε/prime Fis the true strain corresponding to fracture in one re- versal (point Ain Fig. 6–12). The plastic-strain line begins at this point in Fig. 6–13. •Fatigue strength coefﬁcient σ/prime Fis the true stress corresponding to fracture in one reversal (point Ain Fig. 6–12). Note in Fig. 6–13 that the elastic-strain line begins at σ/prime F/E. •Fatigue ductility exponent c is the slope of the plastic-strain line in Fig. 6–13 and is the power to which the life 2 Nmust be raised to be proportional to the true plastic- strain amplitude.

Now, from Fig. 6–12, we see that the total strain is the sum of the elastic and plastic components. Therefore the total strain amplitude is half the total strain range /Delta1ε 2=/Delta1εe 2+/Delta1εp 2(a) The equation of the plastic-strain line in Fig. 6–13 is /Delta1εp 2=ε/prime F(2N)c(6–1) The equation of the elastic strain line is /Delta1εe 2=σ/prime F E(2N)b(6–2) Therefore, from Eq. ( a), we have for the total-strain amplitude /Delta1ε 2=σ/prime F E(2N)b+ε/prime F(2N)c(6–3) which is the Manson-Cofﬁn relationship between fatigue life and total strain.5Some values of the coefﬁcients and exponents are listed in Table A–23. Many more are included in the SAE J1099 report.6 Though Eq. (6–3) is a perfectly legitimate equation for obtaining the fatigue life of a part when the strain and other cyclic characteristics are given, it appears to be of lit- tle use to the designer. The question of how to determine the total strain at the bottom of a notch or discontinuity has not been answered. There are no tables or charts of strain- concentration factors in the literature. It is possible that strain-concentration factors will become available in research literature very soon because of the increase in the use of ﬁnite-element analysis. Moreover, ﬁnite element analysis can of itself approximate the strains that will occur at all points in the subject structure.7 6–6 The Linear-Elastic Fracture Mechanics Method The ﬁrst phase of fatigue cracking is designated as stage I fatigue. Crystal slip that extends through several contiguous grains, inclusions, and surface imperfections is pre- sumed to play a role. Since most of this is invisible to the observer, we just say that stage I involves several grains. The second phase, that of crack extension, is called stage II fatigue. The advance of the crack (that is, new crack area is created) does produce evi- dence that can be observed on micrographs from an electron microscope. The growth of 5J. F. Tavernelli and L. F.

Final fracture occurs during stage III fatigue, although fatigue is not involved. When the crack is sufﬁciently long that KI=KIcfor the stress amplitude involved, where KIcis the critical stress intensity for the undamaged metal, then there is sudden, catastrophic failure of the remaining cross section in tensile overload (see Sec. 5–12). Stage III fatigue is associated with rapid acceleration of crack growth then fracture. Crack Growth Fatigue cracks nucleate and grow when stresses vary and there is some tension in each stress cycle. Consider the stress to be ﬂuctuating between the limits of σminand σmax, where the stress range is deﬁned as /Delta1σ=σmax−σmin.From Eq. (5–37) the stress intensity is given by KI=βσ√πa.Thus, for /Delta1σ, the stress intensity range per cycle is /Delta1KI=β(σ max−σmin)√πa=β/Delta1σ√πa (6–4) To develop fatigue strength data, a number of specimens of the same material are tested at various levels of /Delta1σ. Cracks nucleate at or very near a free surface or large discon- tinuity. Assuming an initial crack length of ai,crack growth as a function of the num- ber of stress cycles N will depend on /Delta1σ, that is, /Delta1KI.For /Delta1KIbelow some threshold value (/Delta1KI)tha crack will not grow. Figure 6–14 represents the crack length aas a function of Nfor three stress levels (/Delta1σ) 3>(/Delta1σ) 2>(/Delta1σ) 1, where (/Delta1KI)3> (/Delta1KI)2>(/Delta1KI)1for a given crack size. Notice the effect of the higher stress range in Fig. 6–14 in the production of longer cracks at a particular cycle count. When the rate of crack growth per cycle, da/dNin Fig. 6–14, is plotted as shown in Fig. 6–15, the data from all three stress range levels superpose to give a sigmoidal curve. The three stages of crack development are observable, and the stage II data are linear on log-log coordinates, within the domain of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) validity. A group of similar curves can be generated by changing the stress ratio R=σmin/σmaxof the experiment.

The following example is highly simpliﬁed with βconstant in order to give some understanding of the procedure. Normally, one uses fatigue crack growth computer pro- grams such as NASA/FLAGRO 2.0 with more comprehensive theoretical models to solve these problems. EXAMPLE 6–1 The bar shown in Fig. 6–16 is subjected to a repeated moment 0 ≤M≤1200 lbf ·in. The bar is AISI 4430 steel with Sut=185 kpsi, Sy=170 kpsi, and KIc=73 kpsi√ in. Material tests on various specimens of this material with identical heat treatment indicate worst-case constants of C=3.8(10−11)(in/cycle) /(kpsi√ in)mand m=3.0. As shown, a nick of size 0.004 in has been discovered on the bottom of the bar. Estimate the number of cycles of life remaining. Solution The stress range /Delta1σis always computed by using the nominal (uncracked) area. Thus I c=bh2 6=0.25(0.5)2 6=0.010 42 in3 Therefore, before the crack initiates, the stress range is /Delta1σ=/Delta1M I/c=1200 0.010 42=115.2(103)psi=115.2 kpsi which is below the yield strength. As the crack grows, it will eventually become long enough such that the bar will completely yield or undergo a brittle fracture. For the ratio of Sy/Sutit is highly unlikely that the bar will reach complete yield. For brittle fracture, designate the crack length as af. If β=1,then from Eq.

Generally, stress testing is preferred to strain testing for endurance limits. For preliminary and prototype design and for some failure analysis as well, a quick method of estimating endurance limits is needed. There are great quantities of data in the literature on the results of rotating-beam tests and simple tension tests of specimens taken from the same bar or ingot. By plotting these as in Fig. 6–17, it is possible to see whether there is any correlation between the two sets of results. The graph appears to suggest that the endurance limit ranges from about 40 to 60 percent of the tensile strength for steels up to about 210 kpsi (1450 MPa). Beginning at about Sut=210kpsi (1450 MPa), the scatter appears to increase, but the trend seems to level off, as sug- gested by the dashed horizontal line at S/prime e=105kpsi. We wish now to present a method for estimating endurance limits. Note that esti- mates obtained from quantities of data obtained from many sources probably have a large spread and might deviate signiﬁcantly from the results of actual laboratory tests of the mechanical properties of specimens obtained through strict purchase-order speciﬁ- cations. Since the area of uncertainty is greater, compensation must be made by employ- ing larger design factors than would be used for static design. For steels, simplifying our observation of Fig. 6–17, we will estimate the endurance limit as S/prime e=⎧ ⎨ ⎩0.5Sut Sut≤200 kpsi (1400 MPa ) 100 kpsi Sut>200 kpsi 700 MPa Sut>1400 MPa(6–8) where Sutis the minimum tensile strength. The prime mark on S/prime ein this equation refers to the rotating-beam specimen itself. We wish to reserve the unprimed symbol Sefor the endurance limit of an actual machine element subjected to any kind of loading. Soon we shall learn that the two strengths may be quite different.Answerbud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 12/02/2009 6:49 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Fatigue Failure Resulting from Variable Loading 283 Steels treated to give different microstructures have different S/prime e/Sutratios. It appears that the more ductile microstructures have a higher ratio. Martensite has a very brittle nature and is highly susceptible to fatigue-induced cracking; thus the ratio is low. When designs include detailed heat-treating speciﬁcations to obtain speciﬁc micro- structures, it is possible to use an estimate of the endurance limit based on test data for the particular microstructure; such estimates are much more reliable and indeed should be used. The endurance limits for various classes of cast irons, polished or machined, are given in Table A–24. Aluminum alloys do not have an endurance limit. The fatigue strengths of some aluminum alloys at 5(108) cycles of reversed stress are given in Table A–24. 6–8 Fatigue Strength As shown in Fig. 6–10, a region of low-cycle fatigue extends from N=1to about 103cycles. In this region the fatigue strength Sfis only slightly smaller than the tensile strength Sut.

Engineers often have to work with less information. Figure 6–10 indicates that the high-cycle fatigue domain extends from 103cycles for steels to the endurance limit life Ne, which is about 106to107cycles. The purpose of this section is to develop methods of approximation of the S-Ndiagram in the high- cycle region, when information may be as sparse as the results of a simple tension test. Experience has shown high-cycle fatigue data are rectiﬁed by a logarithmic transform to both stress and cycles-to-failure. Equation (6–2) can be used to determine the fatigue strength at 103cycles. Deﬁning the specimen fatigue strength at a speciﬁc number of cycles as (S/prime f)N=E/Delta1εe/2, write Eq. (6–2) as (S/prime f)N=σ/prime F(2N)b(6–9) At 103cycles, (S/prime f)103=σ/prime F(2·103)b=fSut where fis the fraction of Sutrepresented by (S/prime f)103cycles .

Figure 6–18 is a plot of ffor 70≤Sut≤200kpsi. To be conservative, for Sut<70 kpsi , let f =0.9. For an actual mechanical component, S/prime eis reduced to Se(see Sec. 6–9) which is less than 0.5 Sut. However, unless actual data is available, we recommend using the value of ffound from Fig. 6–18.

For general ﬂuctuating loading situations, it is necessary to obtain a completely reversed stress that may be considered to be equivalent in fatigue damage as the actual ﬂuctuating stress (see Ex. 6–12, p. 313). Low-cycle fatigue is often deﬁned (see Fig. 6–10) as failure that occurs in a range of 1≤N≤103cycles. On a log-log plot such as Fig. 6–10 the failure locus in this range is nearly linear below 103cycles.

So expressing the answers using three-place accuracy is a little misleading. 6–9 Endurance Limit Modifying Factors We have seen that the rotating-beam specimen used in the laboratory to determine endurance limits is prepared very carefully and tested under closely controlled condi- tions. It is unrealistic to expect the endurance limit of a mechanical or structural mem- ber to match the values obtained in the laboratory. Some differences include •Material: composition, basis of failure, variability •Manufacturing: method, heat treatment, fretting corrosion, surface condition, stress concentration •Environment: corrosion, temperature, stress state, relaxation times •Design: size, shape, life, stress state, speed, fretting, gallingbud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 11/30/2009 4:23 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Fatigue Failure Resulting from Variable Loading 287 Marin12identiﬁed factors that quantiﬁed the effects of surface condition, size, loading, temperature, and miscellaneous items. The question of whether to adjust the endurance limit by subtractive corrections or multiplicative corrections was resolved by an exten- sive statistical analysis of a 4340 (electric furnace, aircraft quality) steel, in which a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.85 was found for the multiplicative form and 0.40 for the additive form. A Marin equation is therefore written as Se=kakbkckdkekfS/prime e (6–18) where ka=surface condition modiﬁcation factor kb=size modiﬁcation factor kc=load modiﬁcation factor kd=temperature modiﬁcation factor ke=reliability factor13 kf=miscellaneous-effects modiﬁcation factor S/prime e=rotary-beam test specimen endurance limit Se=endurance limit at the critical location of a machine part in the geometry and condition of use When endurance tests of parts are not available, estimations are made by applying Marin factors to the endurance limit. Surface Factor ka The surface of a rotating-beam specimen is highly polished, with a ﬁnal polishing in the axial direction to smooth out any circumferential scratches. The surface modiﬁcation factor depends on the quality of the ﬁnish of the actual part surface and on the tensile strength of the part material. To ﬁnd quantitative expressions for common ﬁnishes of machine parts (ground, machined, or cold-drawn, hot-rolled, and as-forged), the coordi- nates of data points were recaptured from a plot of endurance limit versus ultimate tensile strength of data gathered by Lipson and Noll and reproduced by Horger.14The data can be represented by ka=aSb ut (6–19) where Sutis the minimum tensile strength and aand bare to be found in Table 6–2. 12Joseph Marin, Mechanical Behavior of Engineering Materials, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1962, p. 224. 13Complete stochastic analysis is presented in Sec. 6–17. Until that point the presentation here is one of a deterministic nature. However, we must take care of the known scatter in the fatigue data. This means that we will not carry out a true reliability analysis at this time but will attempt to answer the question: What is the probability that a known (assumed) stress will exceed the strength of a randomly selected component made from this material population? 14C.

Again, it is important to note that this is an approximation as the data is typically quite scattered. Furthermore, this is not a correction to take lightly. For example, if in the previous example the steel was forged, the correction factor would be 0.540, a sig- niﬁcant reduction of strength.

For a rotating round section, the 95 percent stress area is the area in a ring having an outside diameter dand an inside diameter of 0.95 d. So, designating the 95 percent stress area A0.95σ, we have A0.95σ=π 4[d2−(0.95d)2]=0.0766 d2(6–22) This equation is also valid for a rotating hollow round. For nonrotating solid or hollow rounds, the 95 percent stress area is twice the area outside of two parallel chords hav- ing a spacing of 0.95 d, where dis the diameter. Using an exact computation, this is A0.95σ=0.01046 d2(6–23) With dein Eq. (6–22), setting Eqs. (6–22) and (6–23) equal to each other enables us to solve for the effective diameter.

Any stress will induce creep in a material operating at high temperatures; so this factor must be considered too.A0.95σ=/braceleftbigg0.05ab axis 1-1 0.052xa+0.1tf(b−x) axis 2-21 2 2 1a b tfxA0.95σ=/braceleftbigg0.10atf axis 1-1 0.05ba t f>0.025a axis 2-21 22 1a b tfA0.95σ=0.05hb de=0.808√ hbb h2 21 1A0.95σ=0.01046 d2 de=0.370ddTable 6–3 A0.95σAreas of Common Nonrotating Structural Shapes 17Use this only for pure torsional fatigue loading.

Because of the reduced fatigue resistance, the failure process is, to some extent, dependent on time. The limited amount of data available show that the endurance limit for steels increases slightly as the temperature rises and then begins to fall off in the 400 to 700°F range, not unlike the behavior of the tensile strength shown in Fig. 2–9. For this reason it is probably true that the endurance limit is related to tensile strength at elevated tem- peratures in the same manner as at room temperature.18It seems quite logical, therefore, to employ the same relations to predict endurance limit at elevated temperatures as are used at room temperature, at least until more comprehensive data become available. At the very least, this practice will provide a useful standard against which the perfor- mance of various materials can be compared. Table 6–4 has been obtained from Fig. 2–9 by using only the tensile-strength data. Note that the table represents 145 tests of 21 different carbon and alloy steels. A fourth- order polynomial curve ﬁt to the data underlying Fig. 2–9 gives kd=0.975+0.432(10−3)TF−0.115(10−5)T2 F +0.104(10−8)T3 F−0.595(10−12)T4 F( 6–27) where 70≤TF≤1000◦F.

(6–27) and proceed as usual. If the rotating-beam endurance limit is not given, then compute it using Eq. (6–8) and the temperature-corrected tensile strength obtained by using the factor from Table 6–4. Then use kd=1. EXAMPLE 6–5 A 1035 steel has a tensile strength of 70 kpsi and is to be used for a part that sees 450°F in service. Estimate the Marin temperature modiﬁcation factor and (Se)450◦if (a) The room-temperature endurance limit by test is (S/prime e)70◦=39.0kpsi. (b) Only the tensile strength at room temperature is known. Solution (a) First, from Eq. (6–27), kd=0.975+0.432(10−3)(450)−0.115(10−5)(4502) +0.104(10−8)(4503)−0.595(10−12)(4504)=1.007 Thus, Answer (Se)450◦=kd(S/prime e)70◦=1.007(39.0)=39.3 kpsi (b) Interpolating from Table 6–4 gives (ST/SRT)450◦=1.018+(0.995−1.018)450−400 500−400=1.007 Thus, the tensile strength at 450°F is estimated as (Sut)450◦=(ST/SRT)450◦(Sut)70◦=1.007(70)=70.5 kpsi From Eq. (6–8) then, Answer (Se)450◦=0.5(Sut)450◦=0.5(70.5)=35.2 kpsi Part agives the better estimate due to actual testing of the particular material. Reliability Factor ke The discussion presented here accounts for the scatter of data such as shown in Fig. 6–17 where the mean endurance limit is shown to be S/prime e/Sut.=0.5,or as given by Eq. (6–8). Most endurance strength data are reported as mean values. Data presented by Haugen and Wirching19show standard deviations of endurance strengths of less than 8 percent. Thus the reliability modiﬁcation factor to account for this can be written as ke=1−0.08za (6–29) where zais deﬁned by Eq. (20–16) and values for any desired reliability can be deter- mined from Table A–10. Table 6–5 gives reliability factors for some standard speciﬁed reliabilities. For a more comprehensive approach to reliability, see Sec. 6–17. 19E. B. Haugen and P. H. Wirsching, “Probabilistic Design,” Machine Design, vol. 47, no. 12, 1975, pp. 10–14.bud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 12/10/2009 4:46 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Fatigue Failure Resulting from Variable Loading 293 Miscellaneous-Effects Factor kf Though the factor kfis intended to account for the reduction in endurance limit due to all other effects, it is really intended as a reminder that these must be accounted for, because actual values of kfare not always available. Residual stresses may either improve the endurance limit or affect it adversely. Generally, if the residual stress in the surface of the part is compression, the endurance limit is improved. Fatigue failures appear to be tensile failures, or at least to be caused by tensile stress, and so anything that reduces tensile stress will also reduce the possi- bility of a fatigue failure. Operations such as shot peening, hammering, and cold rolling build compressive stresses into the surface of the part and improve the endurance limit signiﬁcantly. Of course, the material must not be worked to exhaustion. The endurance limits of parts that are made from rolled or drawn sheets or bars, as well as parts that are forged, may be affected by the so-called directional character- istics of the operation. Rolled or drawn parts, for example, have an endurance limit in the transverse direction that may be 10 to 20 percent less than the endurance limit in the longitudinal direction. Parts that are case-hardened may fail at the surface or at the maximum core radius, depending upon the stress gradient. Figure 6–19 shows the typical triangular stress dis- tribution of a bar under bending or torsion. Also plotted as a heavy line in this ﬁgure are the endurance limits Sefor the case and core. For this example the endurance limit of the core rules the design because the ﬁgure shows that the stress σorτ, whichever applies, at the outer core radius, is appreciably larger than the core endurance limit.Se (case) /H9268 or /H9270 Se (core)Case CoreFigure 6–19 The failure of a case-hardened part in bending or torsion.

This is, of course, true, and it is due to the roughening or pitting of the surface by the corrosive material. But the problem is not so simple as the one of ﬁnding the endurance limit of a specimen that has been corroded. The reason for this is that the corrosion and the stressing occur at the same time. Basically, this means that in time any part will fail when subjected to repeated stressing in a corrosive atmosphere. There is no fatigue limit. Thus the designer’s problem is to attempt to minimize the fac- tors that affect the fatigue life; these are: •Mean or static stress •Alternating stress •Electrolyte concentration •Dissolved oxygen in electrolyte •Material properties and composition •Temperature •Cyclic frequency •Fluid ﬂow rate around specimen •Local crevices Electrolytic Plating Metallic coatings, such as chromium plating, nickel plating, or cadmium plating, reduce the endurance limit by as much as 50 percent. In some cases the reduction by coatings has been so severe that it has been necessary to eliminate the plating process. Zinc plating does not affect the fatigue strength. Anodic oxidation of light alloys reduces bending endurance limits by as much as 39 percent but has no effect on the torsional endurance limit. Metal Spraying Metal spraying results in surface imperfections that can initiate cracks. Limited tests show reductions of 14 percent in the fatigue strength. Cyclic Frequency If, for any reason, the fatigue process becomes time-dependent, then it also becomes frequency-dependent. Under normal conditions, fatigue failure is independent of fre- quency. But when corrosion or high temperatures, or both, are encountered, the cyclic rate becomes important. The slower the frequency and the higher the temperature, the higher the crack propagation rate and the shorter the life at a given stress level. Frettage Corrosion The phenomenon of frettage corrosion is the result of microscopic motions of tightly ﬁtting parts or structures. Bolted joints, bearing-race ﬁts, wheel hubs, and any set of tightly ﬁtted parts are examples. The process involves surface discoloration, pitting, and eventual fatigue. The frettage factor kfdepends upon the material of the mating pairs and ranges from 0.24 to 0.90.bud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 11/30/2009 4:23 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Fatigue Failure Resulting from Variable Loading 295 6–10 Stress Concentration and Notch Sensitivity In Sec. 3–13 it was pointed out that the existence of irregularities or discontinuities, such as holes, grooves, or notches, in a part increases the theoretical stresses signiﬁ- cantly in the immediate vicinity of the discontinuity. Equation (3–48) deﬁned a stress- concentration factor Kt(orKts), which is used with the nominal stress to obtain the maximum resulting stress due to the irregularity or defect. It turns out that some mate- rials are not fully sensitive to the presence of notches and hence, for these, a reduced value of Ktcan be used. For these materials, the effective maximum stress in fatigue is, σmax=Kfσ0 or τmax=Kfsτ0 (6–30) where Kfis a reduced value of Ktand σ0is the nominal stress. The factor Kfis com- monly called a fatigue stress-concentration factor, and hence the subscript f. So it is convenient to think of Kfas a stress-concentration factor reduced from Ktbecause of lessened sensitivity to notches. The resulting factor is deﬁned by the equation Kf=maximum stress in notched specimen stress in notch-free specimen(a) Notch sensitivity q is deﬁned by the equation q=Kf−1 Kt−1or qshear=Kfs−1 Kts−1(6–31) where qis usually between zero and unity. Equation (6–31) shows that if q=0,then Kf=1,and the material has no sensitivity to notches at all. On the other hand, if q=1,then Kf=Kt, and the material has full notch sensitivity. In analysis or design work, ﬁnd Ktﬁrst, from the geometry of the part. Then specify the material, ﬁnd q, and solve for Kffrom the equation Kf=1+q(Kt−1) or Kfs=1+qshear(Kts−1) (6–32) Notch sensitivities for speciﬁc materials are obtained experimentally. Published experimental values are limited, but some values are available for steels and aluminum.

In using these charts it is well to know that the actual test results from which the curves were derived exhibit a large amount of scatter. Because of this scatter it is always safe to use Kf=Ktif there is any doubt about the true value of q. Also, note that qis not far from unity for large notch radii. Figure 6–20 has as its basis the Neuber equation, which is given by Kf=1+Kt−1 1+√a/r(6–33) where √ais deﬁned as the Neuber constant and is a material constant. Equating Eqs. (6–31) and (6–33) yields the notch sensitivity equation q=1 1+√a√r(6–34) correlating with Figs. 6–20 and 6–21 as Bending or axial:√a=0.246−3.08(10−3)Sut+1.51(10−5)S2 ut−2.67(10−8)S3 ut (6–35 a) Torsion:√a=0.190−2.51(10−3)Sut+1.35(10−5)S2 ut−2.67(10−8)S3 ut(6–35 b) where the equations apply to steel and Sutis in kpsi. Equation (6–34) used in conjunction with Eq. pair (6–35) is equivalent to Figs. (6–20) and (6–21). As with the graphs, the results from the curve ﬁt equations provide only approximations to the experimental data. The notch sensitivity of cast irons is very low, varying from 0 to about 0.20, depending upon the tensile strength. To be on the conservative side, it is recommended that the value q=0.20be used for all grades of cast iron.

For simple loading, inﬁ- nite life problems, it makes no difference whether Seis reduced by dividing it by Kfor the nominal stress is multiplied by Kf. However, for ﬁnite life, since the S-Ndiagram is nonlinear, the two approaches yield differing results. There is no clear evidence pointing to which method is better. Furthermore, in Sec. 6–14, when we consider com- bining loads, there generally are multiple fatigue stress-concentration factors occurring at a point (e.g. Kffor bending and Kfsfor torsion). Here, it is only practical to modify the nominal stresses. To be consistent in this text, we will exclusively use the fatigue stress-concentration factor as a multiplier of the nominal stress.

Consider the shaft undergoes a fully reversing nominal stress in the ﬁl- let of (σrev)nom=260 MPa. Estimate the number of cycles to failure.

Using ASTM “minimum” strengths, estimate the life of the part. Solution From Fig. 6–22 bwe learn that failure will probably occur at Brather than at Cor at the point of maximum moment. Point Bhas a smaller cross section, a higher bending moment, and a higher stress-concentration factor than C, and the location of maximum moment has a larger size and no stress-concentration factor. We shall solve the problem by ﬁrst estimating the strength at point B, since the strength will be different elsewhere, and comparing this strength with the stress at the same point.

However, other patterns, some quite irreg- ular, do occur. It has been found that in periodic patterns exhibiting a single maxi- mum and a single minimum of force, the shape of the wave is not important, but the peaks on both the high side (maximum) and the low side (minimum) are important. Thus Fmaxand Fminin a cycle of force can be used to characterize the force pattern. It is also true that ranging above and below some baseline can be equally effective in characterizing the force pattern. If the largest force is Fmaxand the smallest force is Fmin, then a steady component and an alternating component can be constructed as follows: Fm=Fmax+Fmin 2Fa=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleFmax−Fmin 2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle where Fmis the midrange steady component of force, and Fais the amplitude of the alternating component of force.bud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 11/30/2009 4:23 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Fatigue Failure Resulting from Variable Loading 301 Figure 6–23 illustrates some of the various stress-time traces that occur. The com- ponents of stress, some of which are shown in Fig. 6–23 d, are σmin=minimum stress σm=midrange component σmax=maximum stress σr=range of stress σa=amplitude component σs=static or steady stress The steady, or static, stress is notthe same as the midrange stress; in fact, it may have any value between σminand σmax. The steady stress exists because of a ﬁxed load or pre- load applied to the part, and it is usually independent of the varying portion of the load. A helical compression spring, for example, is always loaded into a space shorter than the free length of the spring. The stress created by this initial compression is called the steady, or static, component of the stress. It is not the same as the midrange stress. We shall have occasion to apply the subscripts of these components to shear stresses as well as normal stresses.

(6–36), the stress ratio R=σmin σmax(6–37) and the amplitude ratio A=σa σm(6–38) are also deﬁned and used in connection with ﬂuctuating stresses. Equations (6–36) utilize symbols σaand σmas the stress components at the loca- tion under scrutiny. This means, in the absence of a notch, σaand σmare equal to the nominal stresses σaoand σmoinduced by loads Faand Fm, respectively; in the presence of a notch they are Kfσaoand Kfσmo, respectively, as long as the material remains without plastic strain. In other words, the fatigue stress-concentration factor Kfis applied to both components. When the steady stress component is high enough to induce localized notch yield- ing, the designer has a problem. The ﬁrst-cycle local yielding produces plastic strain and strain-strengthening. This is occurring at the location where fatigue crack nucle- ation and growth are most likely. The material properties ( Syand Sut) are new and difﬁcult to quantify. The prudent engineer controls the concept, material and condition of use, and geometry so that no plastic strain occurs. There are discussions concerning possible ways of quantifying what is occurring under localized and general yielding in the presence of a notch, referred to as the nominal mean stress method, residual stress method, and the like.20The nominal mean stress method (set σa=Kfσaoand σm=σmo) gives roughly comparable results to the residual stress method, but both are approximations . There is the method of Dowling21for ductile materials, which, for materials with a pronounced yield point and approximated by an elastic–perfectly plastic behavior model, quantitatively expresses the steady stress component stress-concentration factor Kfmas Kfm=Kf Kf|σmax,o|<Sy Kfm=Sy−Kfσao |σmo|Kf|σmax,o|>Sy Kfm=0 Kf|σmax,o−σmin,o|>2Sy(6–39) For the purposes of this book, for ductile materials in fatigue, •Avoid localized plastic strain at a notch. Set σa=Kfσa,oand σm=Kfσmo. •When plastic strain at a notch cannot be avoided, use Eqs. (6–39); or conservatively, set σa=Kfσaoand use Kfm=1, that is, σm=σmo. 20R. C.

Three methods of plotting the results of such tests are in general use and are shown in Figs. 6–24, 6–25, and 6–26. The modiﬁed Goodman diagram of Fig. 6–24 has the midrange stress plotted along the abscissa and all other components of stress plotted on the ordinate, with tension in the positive direction. The endurance limit, fatigue strength, or ﬁnite-life strength, whichever applies, is plotted on the ordinate above and below the origin. The midrange- stress line is a 45◦line from the origin to the tensile strength of the part. The modiﬁed Goodman diagram consists of the lines constructed to Se(or Sf) above and below the origin. Note that the yield strength is also plotted on both axes, because yielding would be the criterion of failure if σmaxexceeded Sy. Another way to display test results is shown in Fig. 6–25. Here the abscissa repre- sents the ratio of the midrange strength Smto the ultimate strength, with tension plot- ted to the right and compression to the left. The ordinate is the ratio of the alternating strength to the endurance limit. The line BCthen represents the modiﬁed Goodman criterion of failure. Note that the existence of midrange stress in the compressive region has little effect on the endurance limit. The very clever diagram of Fig. 6–26 is unique in that it displays four of the stress components as well as the two stress ratios. A curve representing the endurance limit for values of Rbeginning at R=−1and ending with R=1begins at Seon the σaaxis and ends at Suton the σmaxis.

Any stress state, such as the one at A, can be described by the min- imum and maximum components, or by the midrange and alternating components.

Neither a fatigue diagram nor any other failure criteria need be developed. In Fig. 6–27, the tensile side of Fig. 6–25 has been redrawn in terms of strengths, instead of strength ratios, with the same modiﬁed Goodman criterion together with four additional criteria of failure. Such diagrams are often constructed for analysis and design purposes; they are easy to use and the results can be scaled off directly. The early viewpoint expressed on a σm,σadiagram was that there existed a locus which divided safe from unsafe combinations of σmand σa. Ensuing proposals included the parabola of Gerber (1874), the Goodman (1890)22(straight) line, and the Soderberg (1930) (straight) line. As more data were generated it became clear that a fatigue criterion, rather than being a “fence,” was more like a zone or band wherein the probability of fail- ure could be estimated. We include the failure criterion of Goodman because •It is a straight line and the algebra is linear and easy. •It is easily graphed, every time for every problem. •It reveals subtleties of insight into fatigue problems. •Answers can be scaled from the diagrams as a check on the algebra. We also caution that it is deterministic and the phenomenon is not. It is biased and we cannot quantify the bias. It is not conservative. It is a stepping-stone to understanding; it is history; and to read the work of other engineers and to have meaningful oral exchanges with them, it is necessary that you understand the Goodman approach should it arise. Either the fatigue limit Seor the ﬁnite-life strength Sfis plotted on the ordinate of Fig. 6–27. These values will have already been corrected using the Marin factors of Eq. (6–18). Note that the yield strength Syis plotted on the ordinate too. This serves as a reminder that ﬁrst-cycle yielding rather than fatigue might be the criterion of failure. The midrange-stress axis of Fig. 6–27 has the yield strength Syand the tensile strength Sutplotted along it. Figure 6–27 Fatigue diagram showing various criteria of failure. For each criterion, points on or “above” the respective line indicate failure. Some point A on the Goodman line, for example, gives the strength Sm as the limiting value of σm corresponding to the strength Sa, which, paired with σm, is the limiting value of σa.

The diagram shows that only the Soderberg criterion guards against any yielding, but is biased low. Considering the modiﬁed Goodman line as a criterion, point Arepresents a limit- ing point with an alternating strength Saand midrange strength Sm. The slope of the load line shown is deﬁned as r=Sa/Sm. The criterion equation for the Soderberg line is Sa Se+Sm Sy=1 (6–40) Similarly, we ﬁnd the modiﬁed Goodman relation to be Sa Se+Sm Sut=1 (6–41) Examination of Fig. 6–25 shows that both a parabola and an ellipse have a better opportunity to pass among the midrange tension data and to permit quantiﬁcation of the probability of failure. The Gerber failure criterion is written as Sa Se+/parenleftbiggSm Sut/parenrightbigg2 =1 (6–42) and the ASME-elliptic is written as /parenleftbiggSa Se/parenrightbigg2 +/parenleftbiggSm Sy/parenrightbigg2 =1 (6–43) The Langer first-cycle-yielding criterion is used in connection with the fatigue curve: Sa+Sm=Sy (6–44) The stresses nσaand nσmcan replace Saand Sm, where nis the design factor or factor of safety. Then, Eq. (6–40), the Soderberg line, becomes Soderbergσa Se+σm Sy=1 n(6–45) Equation (6–41), the modiﬁed Goodman line, becomes mod-Goodmanσa Se+σm Sut=1 n(6–46) Equation (6–42), the Gerber line, becomes Gerbernσa Se+/parenleftbiggnσm Sut/parenrightbigg2 =1 (6–47) Equation (6–43), the ASME-elliptic line, becomes ASME-elliptic/parenleftbiggnσa Se/parenrightbigg2 +/parenleftbiggnσm Sy/parenrightbigg2 =1 (6–48) We will emphasize the Gerber and ASME-elliptic for fatigue failure criterion and the Langer for ﬁrst-cycle yielding. However, conservative designers often use the modiﬁed Goodman criterion, so we will continue to include it in our discussions.

The ﬁrst row of each table corresponds to the fatigue criterion, the second row is the static Langer criterion, and the third row corresponds to the intersection of the static and fatiguebud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 12/02/2009 6:49 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:308 Mechanical Engineering Design criteria. The ﬁrst column gives the intersecting equations and the second column the intersection coordinates. There are two ways to proceed with a typical analysis. One method is to assume that fatigue occurs first and use one of Eqs. (6–45) to (6–48) to determine nor size, depending on the task. Most often fatigue is the governing failure mode. Then follow with a static check. If static failure governs then the analysis is repeated using Eq. (6–49). Alternatively, one could use the tables. Determine the load line and establish which criterion the load line intersects ﬁrst and use the corresponding equations in the tables. Some examples will help solidify the ideas just discussed.

The follower range of motion is 2 in and ﬁxed, so the alternating component of force, bending moment, and stress is ﬁxed, too. The spring is preloaded to adjust to various cam speeds. The preload must be increased to prevent follower ﬂoat or jump. For lower speeds the preload should be decreased to obtain longer life of cam and follower surfaces. The spring is a steel cantilever 32 in long, 2 in wide, and 1 4in thick, as seen in Fig. 6–30 a. The spring strengths are Sut=150kpsi, Sy=127kpsi, and Se= 28kpsi fully corrected.

(6–46), the fatigue factor of safety based on inﬁnite life is nf=1 σa Se+σm Sut=1 40 40+20 80=0.8 This indicates a ﬁnite life is predicted. The S-Ndiagram is only applicable for completely reversed stresses. To estimate the ﬁnite life for a ﬂuctuating stress, we will obtain an equivalent completely reversed stress that is expected to be as damaging as the ﬂuctuat- ing stress. A commonly used approach is to assume that since the modiﬁed Goodman line represents all stress situations with a constant life of 106cycles, other constant-life lines can be generated by passing a line through ( Sut, 0) and a ﬂuctuating stress point (σm,σa). The point where this line intersects the σaaxis represents a completely reversed stress (since at this point σm=0), which predicts the same life as the ﬂuctuating stress.bud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 12/02/2009 6:49 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:314 Mechanical Engineering Design This completely reversed stress can be obtained by replacing Sewith σrevin Eq.

Brittle materials are more sensitive to midrange stress, being lowered, but compressive midrange stresses are beneﬁcial. •Not enough work has been done on brittle fatigue to discover insightful generalities, so we stay in the ﬁrst and a bit of the second quadrant. The most likely domain of designer use is in the range from −Sut≤σm≤Sut. The locus in the ﬁrst quadrant is Goodman, Smith-Dolan, or something in between.

Smith’s ﬁrst result, based on 72 tests, shows that the existence of a torsional steady-stress component not more than the torsional yield strength has no effect on the torsional endurance limit, provided the material is ductile, polished, notch-free, and cylindrical . Smith’s second result applies to materials with stress concentration, notches, or surface imperfections. In this case, he ﬁnds that the torsional fatigue limit decreases monotonically with torsional steady stress. Since the great majority of parts will have surfaces that are less than perfect, this result indicates Gerber, ASME-elliptic, and other approximations are useful. Joerres of Associated Spring-Barnes Group, conﬁrms Smith’s results and recommends the use of the modiﬁed Goodman relation for pulsat- ing torsion. In constructing the Goodman diagram, Joerres uses Ssu=0.67Sut (6–54) Also, from Chap. 5, Ssy=0.577Sytfrom distortion-energy theory, and the mean load factor kcis given by Eq. (6–26), or 0.577. This is discussed further in Chap. 10. 6–14 Combinations of Loading Modes It may be helpful to think of fatigue problems as being in three categories: •Completely reversing simple loads •Fluctuating simple loads •Combinations of loading modes The simplest category is that of a completely reversed single stress which is han- dled with the S-Ndiagram, relating the alternating stress to a life. Only one type of loading is allowed here, and the midrange stress must be zero. The next category incor- porates general ﬂuctuating loads, using a criterion to relate midrange and alternating stresses (modiﬁed Goodman, Gerber, ASME-elliptic, or Soderberg). Again, only one type of loading is allowed at a time. The third category, which we will develop in this section, involves cases where there are combinations of different types of loading, such as combined bending, torsion, and axial. In Sec. 6–9 we learned that a load factor kcis used to obtain the endurance limit, and hence the result is dependent on whether the loading is axial, bending, or torsion. In this section we want to answer the question, “How do we proceed when the loading is a mixture of, say, axial, bending, and torsional loads?” This type of loading introduces a few complications in that there may now exist combined normal and shear stresses, each with alternating and midrange values, and several of the factors used in determin- ing the endurance limit depend on the type of loading. There may also be multiple stress-concentration factors, one for each mode of loading. The problem of how to deal with combined stresses was encountered when developing static failure theories. The distortion energy failure theory proved to be a satisfactory method of combining the 23James O. Smith, “The Effect of Range of Stress on the Fatigue Strength of Metals,” Univ. of Ill. Eng. Exp. Sta. Bull . 334, 1942.bud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 11/30/2009 4:23 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:318 Mechanical Engineering Design multiple stresses on a stress element of a ductile material into a single equivalent von Mises stress. The same approach will be used here. The ﬁrst step is to generate twostress elements—one for the alternating stresses and one for the midrange stresses. Apply the appropriate fatigue stress-concentration factors to each of the stresses; i.e., apply (Kf)bending for the bending stresses, (Kfs)torsion for the torsional stresses, and (Kf)axialfor the axial stresses. Next, calculate an equivalent von Mises stress for each of these two stress elements, σ/prime aand σ/prime m. Finally, select a fatigue failure criterion (modiﬁed Goodman, Gerber, ASME-elliptic, or Soderberg) to complete the fatigue analysis. For the endurance limit, Se, use the endurance limit modiﬁers, ka,kb, and kc, for bending. The torsional load factor, kc=0.59should not be applied as it is already accounted for in the von Mises stress calculation (see footnote 17 on p. 290). The load factor for the axial load can be accounted for by dividing the alternating axial stress by the axial load factor of 0.85. For example, consider the common case of a shaft with bending stresses, torsional shear stresses, and axial stresses. For this case, the von Mises stress is of the form σ/prime=/parenleftbig σx2+3τxy2/parenrightbig1/2. Considering that the bending, torsional, and axial stresses have alternating and midrange components, the von Mises stresses for the two stress elements can be written as σ/prime a=/braceleftBigg/bracketleftbigg (Kf)bending (σa)bending +(Kf)axial(σa)axial 0.85/bracketrightbigg2 +3/bracketleftbig (Kfs)torsion (τa)torsion/bracketrightbig2/bracerightBigg1/2 (6–55) σ/prime m=/braceleftBig/bracketleftbig (Kf)bending (σm)bending +(Kf)axial(σm)axial/bracketrightbig2+3/bracketleftbig (Kfs)torsion (τm)torsion/bracketrightbig2/bracerightBig1/2 (6–56) For ﬁrst-cycle localized yielding, the maximum von Mises stress is calculated. This would be done by ﬁrst adding the axial and bending alternating and midrange stresses to obtain σmaxand adding the alternating and midrange shear stresses to obtain τmax. Then substitute σmaxand τmaxinto the equation for the von Mises stress. A simpler and more con- servative method is to add Eq. (6–55) and Eq. (6–56). That is, let σ/prime max.=σ/prime a+σ/prime m. If the stress components are not in phase but have the same frequency, the maxima can be found by expressing each component in trigonometric terms, using phase angles, and then ﬁnding the sum. If two or more stress components have differing frequencies, the problem is difﬁcult; one solution is to assume that the two (or more) components often reach an in-phase condition, so that their magnitudes are additive. EXAMPLE 6–14 A rotating shaft is made of 42- ×4-mm AISI 1018 cold-drawn steel tubing and has a 6-mm-diameter hole drilled transversely through it. Estimate the factor of safety guard- ing against fatigue and static failures using the Gerber and Langer failure criteria for the following loading conditions: (a) The shaft is subjected to a completely reversed torque of 120 N ·m in phase with a completely reversed bending moment of 150 N ·m. (b) The shaft is subjected to a pulsating torque ﬂuctuating from 20 to 160 N ·m and a steady bending moment of 150 N ·m. Solution Here we follow the procedure of estimating the strengths and then the stresses, followed by relating the two.bud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 12/7/09 7:26PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Fatigue Failure Resulting from Variable Loading 319 From Table A–20 we ﬁnd the minimum strengths to be Sut=440MPa and Sy= 370MPa.

Using a/D= 6/42=0.143 andd/D=34/42=0.810, and using linear interpolation, we obtain A=0.798 and Kt=2.366 for bending; and A=0.89and Kts=1.75for torsion.

What stresses are signiﬁcant, what counts as a cycle, and what is the measure of damage incurred? Consider a fully reversed cycle with stresses varying 60, 80, 40, and 60 kpsi and a second fully reversed cycle −40, −60, −20, and −40kpsi as depicted in Fig. 6–33 a. First, it is clear that to impose the pattern of stress in Fig. 6–33 aon a part it is necessary that the time trace look like the solid lines plus the dashed lines in Fig. 6–33 a. Figure 6–33 bmoves the snapshot to exist beginning with 80 kpsi and ending with 80 kpsi. Acknowledging the existence of a single stress-time trace is to discover a “hidden” cycle shown as the dashed line in Fig. 6–33 b. If there are 100 applications of the all-positive stress cycle, then 100 applications of the all-negative stress cycle, the 100 50 0 –50100 50 0 –50 (a) (b)Figure 6–33 Variable stress diagram prepared for assessing cumulative damage.bud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 11/30/2009 4:23 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:322 Mechanical Engineering Design hidden cycle is applied but once. If the all-positive stress cycle is applied alternately with the all-negative stress cycle, the hidden cycle is applied 100 times. To ensure that the hidden cycle is not lost, begin on the snapshot with the largest (or smallest) stress and add previous history to the right side, as was done in Fig. 6–33 b. Characterization of a cycle takes on a max–min–same max (or min–max–same min) form. We identify the hidden cycle ﬁrst by moving along the dashed-line trace in Fig. 6–33 bidentifying a cycle with an 80-kpsi max, a 60-kpsi min, and returning to 80 kpsi. Mentally deleting the used part of the trace (the dashed line) leaves a 40, 60, 40 cycle and a −40, −20, −40cycle. Since failure loci are expressed in terms of stress amplitude component σaand steady component σm, we use Eq. (6–36) to construct the table below: The most damaging cycle is number 1. It could have been lost. Methods for counting cycles include: •Number of tensile peaks to failure. •All maxima above the waveform mean, all minima below. •The global maxima between crossings above the mean and the global minima between crossings below the mean. •All positive slope crossings of levels above the mean, and all negative slope cross- ings of levels below the mean. •A modiﬁcation of the preceding method with only one count made between succes- sive crossings of a level associated with each counting level. •Each local max–min excursion is counted as a half-cycle, and the associated ampli- tude is half-range. •The preceding method plus consideration of the local mean. •Rain-ﬂow counting technique. The method used here amounts to a variation of the rain-ﬂow counting technique . The Palmgren-Miner24cycle-ratio summation rule, also called Miner’s rule, is written /summationdisplayni Ni=c (6–57) where niis the number of cycles at stress level σiand Niis the number of cycles to fail- ure at stress level σi.

The log S–log Ndiagram for this material is shown in Fig. 6–34 by the heavy solid line. From Eqs. (6–14) and (6–15), p. 285, we ﬁnd that a =129.6 kpsi and b=−0.085 091. Now apply, say, a reversed stress σ1=60kpsi for n1=3000 cycles. Since σ1>S/prime e,0, the endurance limit will be damaged, and we wish to ﬁnd the new endurance limit S/prime e,1of the damaged material using the Miner rule. The equation of the virgin material failure line in Fig. 6–34 in the 103to 106cycle range is Sf=aNb=129.6N−0.085 091 The cycles to failure at stress level σ1=60kpsi are N1=/parenleftbiggσ1 129.6/parenrightbigg−1/0.085 091 =/parenleftbigg60 129.6/parenrightbigg−1/0.085 091 =8520 cycles 72 60 40 38.6 103104105106 6 5 4 34.9 4.8 4.7 4.6 4.5Log Sf Sf kpsi N Log N/H926810.9Sut n1 = 3(103) n2 = 0.648(106)Sf,0 Sf,2S'e,0 S'e,1Sf,1 N1 = 8.52(103) N1 – n1 = 5.52(103)Figure 6–34 Use of the Miner rule to predict the endurance limit of a material that has been overstressed for a ﬁnite number of cycles.bud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 12/02/2009 7:23 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Fatigue Failure Resulting from Variable Loading 325 Figure 6–34 shows that the material has a life N1=8520 cycles at 60 kpsi, and conse- quently, after the application of σ1for 3000 cycles, there are N1−n1=5520 cycles of life remaining at σ1. This locates the ﬁnite-life strength Sf,1of the damaged material, as shown in Fig. 6–34. To get a second point, we ask the question: With n1and N1given, how many cycles of stress σ2=S/prime e,0can be applied before the damaged material fails? This corresponds to n2cycles of stress reversal, and hence, from Eq. (6–58), we have n1 N1+n2 N2=1 (a) Solving for n2gives n2=(N1−n1)N2 N1(b) Then n2=/bracketleftbig 8.52/parenleftbig 103/parenrightbig −3/parenleftbig 103/parenrightbig/bracketrightbig 106 8.52/parenleftbig 103/parenrightbig=0.648/parenleftbig 106/parenrightbig cycles This corresponds to the ﬁnite-life strength Sf,2in Fig. 6–34. A line through Sf,1and Sf,2 is the log S–log Ndiagram of the damaged material according to the Miner rule. Two points, ( N1−n1, σ1) and ( n2, σ2), determine the new equation for the line, Sf=a/primeNb/prime. Thus, σ1=a/prime(N1−n1)b/prime, and σ2=a/primenb 2/prime. Dividing the two equations, taking the loga- rithm of the results, and solving for b/primegives b/prime=log(σ1/σ2) log/parenleftbiggN1−n1 n2/parenrightbigg Substituting n2from Eq. ( b) and simplifying gives b/prime=log(σ1/σ2) log(N1/N2) For the undamaged material, N1=(σ1/a)1/band N2=(σ2/a)1/b, then b/prime=log(σ1/σ2) log/bracketleftbig (σ1/a)1/b/(σ2/a)1/b/bracketrightbig=log(σ1/σ2) (1/b)log(σ1/σ2)=b This means that the damaged material line has the same slope as the virgin material line, and the two lines are parallel. The value of a/primeis then found from a/prime=Sf/Nb. For the case we are illustrating, a/prime=60/[5.52(10)3]−0.085 091=124.898kpsi, and thus the new endurance limit is S/prime e,1=a/primeNb e=124.898[(10)6]−0.085 091=38.6kpsi. Though the Miner rule is quite generally used, it fails in two ways to agree with experiment. First, note that this theory states that the static strength Sutis damaged, that is, decreased, because of the application of σ1; see Fig. 6–34 at N=103cycles. Experiments fail to verify this prediction. The Miner rule, as given by Eq. (6–58), does not account for the order in which the stresses are applied, and hence ignores any stresses less than S/prime e,0. But it can be seen in Fig. 6–34 that a stress σ3in the range S/prime e,1<σ 3<S/prime e,0would cause damage if applied after the endurance limit had been damaged by the application of σ1. Manson’s25 approach overcomes both of the deﬁciencies noted for the Palmgren- Miner method; historically it is a much more recent approach, and it is just as easy to 25S. S. Manson, A. J. Nachtigall, C. R. Ensign, and J. C. Fresche, “Further Investigation of a Relation for Cumulative Fatigue Damage in Bending,” Trans. ASME, J. Eng. Ind., ser.

Except for a slight change, we shall use and recommend the Manson method in this book. Manson plotted the S–log Ndiagram instead of a log S–log Nplot as is recommended here. Manson also resorted to experiment to find the point of conver- gence of the S–log Nlines corresponding to the static strength, instead of arbitrarily selecting the intersection of N=103cycles with S=0.9Sutas is done here. Of course, it is always better to use experiment, but our purpose in this book has been to use the simple test data to learn as much as possible about fatigue failure. The method of Manson, as presented here, consists in having all log S–log Nlines, that is, lines for both the damaged and the virgin material, converge to the same point, 0.9Sutat 103cycles. In addition, the log S–log Nlines must be constructed in the same historical order in which the stresses occur. The data from the preceding example are used for illustrative purposes. The results are shown in Fig. 6–35. Note that the strength Sf,1corresponding to N1−n1=5.52(103)cycles is found in the same manner as before. Through this point and through 0.9Sutat 103cycles, draw the heavy dashed line to meet N=106 cycles and deﬁne the endurance limit S/prime e,1of the damaged material. Again, with two points on the line, b/prime=[log (72 /60)]/log [(103)/5.52 (103)]=− 0.106 722, and a/prime=60/[5.52 (103)]−0.106 722=150.487 kpsi. In this case, the new endurance limit is S/prime e,1=a/primeNb e/prime=150.487 (106)−0.106 722=34.4 kpsi, which is somewhat less than that found by the Miner method. It is now easy to see from Fig. 6–35 that a reversed stress σ=36kpsi, say, would not harm the endurance limit of the virgin material, no matter how many cycles it might be applied. However, if σ=36kpsi should be applied after the material was damaged by σ1=60kpsi, then additional damage would be done. Both these rules involve a number of computations, which are repeated every time damage is estimated. For complicated stress-time traces, this might be every cycle. Clearly a computer program is useful to perform the tasks, including scanning the trace and identifying the cycles.72 60 40 103104105106 6 5 4 34.9 4.8 4.7 4.6 4.5Log Sf Sf kpsi N Log N/H926810.9Sut n1 = 3(103)Sf,0 S'e,0 S'e,1Sf,1 N1 = 8.52(103) N1 – n1 = 5.52(103) 34.4Figure 6–35 Use of the Manson method to predict the endurance limit of a material that has been overstressed for a ﬁnite number of cycles.bud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 12/02/2009 7:26 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Fatigue Failure Resulting from Variable Loading 327 Collins said it well: “In spite of all the problems cited, the Palmgren linear damage rule is frequently used because of its simplicity and the experimental fact that other more complex damage theories do not always yield a signiﬁcant improvement in fail- ure prediction reliability.”26 6–16 Surface Fatigue Strength The surface fatigue mechanism is not deﬁnitively understood. The contact-affected zone, in the absence of surface shearing tractions, entertains compressive principal stresses. Rotary fatigue has its cracks grown at or near the surface in the presence of tensile stresses that are associated with crack propagation, to catastrophic failure. There are shear stresses in the zone, which are largest just below the surface. Cracks seem to grow from this stratum until small pieces of material are expelled, leaving pits on the sur- face. Because engineers had to design durable machinery before the surface fatigue phe- nomenon was understood in detail, they had taken the posture of conducting tests, observing pits on the surface, and declaring failure at an arbitrary projected area of hole, and they related this to the Hertzian contact pressure. This compressive stress did not produce the failure directly, but whatever the failure mechanism, whatever the stress type that was instrumental in the failure, the contact stress was an index to its magnitude. Buckingham27conducted a number of tests relating the fatigue at 108cycles to endurance strength (Hertzian contact pressure). While there is evidence of an endurance limit at about 3(107)cycles for cast materials, hardened steel rollers showed no endurance limit up to 4(108)cycles. Subsequent testing on hard steel shows no endurance limit. Hardened steel exhibits such high fatigue strengths that its use in resisting surface fatigue is widespread. Our studies thus far have dealt with the failure of a machine element by yielding, by fracture, and by fatigue. The endurance limit obtained by the rotating-beam test is frequently called the ﬂexural endurance limit, because it is a test of a rotating beam. In this section we shall study a property of mating materials called the surface endurance shear . The design engineer must frequently solve problems in which two machine ele- ments mate with one another by rolling, sliding, or a combination of rolling and sliding contact. Obvious examples of such combinations are the mating teeth of a pair of gears, a cam and follower, a wheel and rail, and a chain and sprocket. A knowledge of the sur- face strength of materials is necessary if the designer is to create machines having a long and satisfactory life. When two surfaces roll or roll and slide against one another with sufﬁcient force, a pitting failure will occur after a certain number of cycles of operation. Authorities are not in complete agreement on the exact mechanism of the pitting; although the subject is quite complicated, they do agree that the Hertz stresses, the number of cycles, the sur- face ﬁnish, the hardness, the degree of lubrication, and the temperature all inﬂuence the strength. In Sec. 3–19 it was learned that, when two surfaces are pressed together, a maximum shear stress is developed slightly below the contacting surface. It is postulated by some authorities that a surface fatigue failure is initiated by this maximum shear stress and then is propagated rapidly to the surface. The lubricant then enters the crack that is formed and, under pressure, eventually wedges the chip loose. 26J. A.

Buckingham and, later, Talbourdet gathered large numbers of data from many tests so that considerab le design information is now available. To make the results useful for designers, Buckingham deﬁned a load-stress factor, also called a wear factor, which is derived from the Hertz equations. Equations (3–73) and (3–74), p. 124, for contacting cylinders are found to be b=/radicalBigg 2F πl/parenleftbig 1−ν2 1/parenrightbig /E1+/parenleftbig 1−ν2 2/parenrightbig /E2 (1/d1)+(1/d2)(6–59) pmax=2F πbl(6–60) where b=half width of rectangular contact area F=contact force l=length of cylinders ν=Poisson’s ratio E=modulus of elasticity d=cylinder diameter It is more convenient to use the cylinder radius, so let 2r=d. If we then designate the length of the cylinders as w(for width of gear, bearing, cam, etc.) instead of land remove the square root sign, Eq. (6–59) becomes b2=4F πw/parenleftbig 1−ν2 1/parenrightbig /E1+/parenleftbig 1−ν2 2/parenrightbig /E2 1/r1+1/r2(6–61) We can deﬁne a surface endurance strength SCusing pmax=2F πbw(6–62) as SC=2F πbw(6–63) which may also be called contact strength, the contact fatigue strength, or the Hertzian endurance strength . The strength is the contacting pressure which, after a speciﬁed number of cycles, will cause failure of the surface. Such failures are often called wear because they occur over a very long time. They should not be confused with abrasive wear, however. By squaring Eq. (6–63), substituting b2from Eq. (6–61), and rearrang- ing, we obtain F w/parenleftbigg1 r1+1 r2/parenrightbigg =πS2 C/bracketleftbigg1−ν2 1 E1+1−ν2 2 E2/bracketrightbigg =K1 (6–64) The left expression consists of parameters a designer may seek to control independently.

In gear studies a similar Kfactor is used: Kg=K1 4sinφ (6–65) where φis the tooth pressure angle, and the term [(1−ν2 1)/E1+(1−ν2 2)/E2]is deﬁned as 1/(πC2 P), so that SC=CP/radicalBigg F w/parenleftbigg1 r1+1 r2/parenrightbigg (6–66) Buckingham and others reported K1for 108cycles and nothing else. This gives only one point on the SCNcurve. For cast metals this may be sufﬁcient, but for wrought steels, heat- treated, some idea of the slope is useful in meeting design goals of other than 108cycles. Experiments show that K1versus N, Kgversus N, and SCversus Ndata are recti- ﬁed by log-log transformation. This suggests that K1=α1Nβ1Kg=aNbSC=αNβ The three exponents are given by β1=log(K1/K2) log(N1/N2)b=log(Kg1/Kg2) log(N1/N2)β=log(SC1/SC2) log(N1/N2)(6–67) Data on induction-hardened steel on steel give (SC)107=271 kpsi and (SC)108= 239 kpsi , so β, from Eq. (6–67), is β=log(271/239) log(107/108)=−0.055 It may be of interest that the American Gear Manufacturers Association (AGMA) uses β/H11005/H11002 0.056 between 104<N<1010if the designer has no data to the contrary beyond 107cycles.

So far, each factor has been treated in a deterministic manner, and if not obvious, these factors are subject to vari- ability and control the overall reliability of the results. When reliability is important, then fatigue testing must certainly be undertaken. There is no other way. Consequently, the methods of stochastic analysis presented here and in other sections of this book constitute guidelines that enable the designer to obtain a good understanding of the various issues involved and help in the development of a safe and reliable design. In this section, key stochastic modiﬁcations to the deterministic features and equa- tions described in earlier sections are provided in the same order of presentation. Endurance Limit To begin, a method for estimating endurance limits, the tensile strength correlation method, is presented. The ratio /H9278=S/prime e/¯Sutis called the fatigue ratio .29For ferrous metals, most of which exhibit an endurance limit, the endurance limit is used as a numerator. For materials that do not show an endurance limit, an endurance strength at a speciﬁed number of cycles to failure is used and noted. Gough30reported the sto- chastic nature of the fatigue ratio /H9278for several classes of metals, and this is shown in Fig. 6–36. The ﬁrst item to note is that the coefﬁcient of variation is of the order 0.10 to 0.15, and the distribution varies for classes of metals. The second item to note is that Gough’s data include materials of no interest to engineers. In the absence of testing, engineers use the correlation that /H9278represents to estimate the endurance limit S/prime efrom the mean ultimate strength ¯Sut. Gough’s data are for ensembles of metals, some chosen for metallurgical interest, and include materials that are not commonly selected for machine parts. Mischke31 analyzed data for 133 common steels and treatments in varying diameters in rotating bending,32and the result was /H9278=0.445d−0.107LN(1,0.138) where dis the specimen diameter in inches and LN(1,0.138)is a unit lognormal vari- ate with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation (and coefﬁcient of variation) of 0.138. For the standard R. R. Moore specimen, /H92780.30=0.445(0.30)−0.107LN(1,0.138)=0.506LN(1,0.138)330 Mechanical Engineering Design 28Review Chap. 20 before reading this section. 29From this point, since we will be dealing with statistical distributions in terms of means, standard deviations, etc. A key quantity, the ultimate strength, will here be presented by its mean value, ¯Sut. This means that certain terms that were deﬁned earlier in terms of the minimum value of Sutwill change slightly. 30In J. A. Pope, Metal Fatigue, Chapman and Hall, London, 1959. 31Charles R.

Equations (6–70) represent the state of information before an engineer has chosen a material. In choosing, the designer has made a random choice from the ensemble of possibilities, and the statistics can give the odds of disappointment. If the testing is lim- ited to ﬁnding an estimate of the ultimate tensile strength mean ¯Sutwith the chosen material, Eqs. (6–70) are directly helpful. If there is to be rotary-beam fatigue testing, then statistical information on the endurance limit is gathered and there is no need for the correlation above.

The stochastic equivalent is q=Kf−1 Kt−1(6–76) where Ktis the theoretical (or geometric) stress-concentration factor, a deterministic quantity. A study of lines 3 and 4 of Table 20–6, will reveal that adding a scalar to (or subtracting one from) a variate xwill affect only the mean. Also, multiplying (or divid- ing) by a scalar affects both the mean and standard deviation.

The reduction in the probability of failure is (0.000 001 71 −0.000 006 35 )/0.000 006 35 =−0.73, a reduction of 73 percent. We are analyzing an existing design, so in part ( a) the factor of safety was ¯n=¯S/¯σ=31.4/10.56=2.97. In part ( b) ¯n=28.4/10.56=2.69,adecrease . This example gives you the opportunity to see the role of the design factor. Given knowledge of ¯S,CS,¯σ,Cσ, and reliability (through z), the mean factor of safety (as a design factor) separates ¯Sand¯σso that the reliability goal is achieved. Knowing ¯nalone says nothing about the probability of failure . Looking at ¯n=2.97and ¯n=2.69says nothing about the respective probabilities of failure. The tests did not reduce ¯Sesigniﬁcantly, but reduced the variation CSsuch that the reliability was increased . When a mean design factor (or mean factor of safety) defined as ¯Se/¯σis said to be silent on matters of frequency of failures, it means that a scalar factor of safety by itself does not offer any information about probability of failure. Nevertheless, some engineers let the factor of safety speak up, and they can be wrong in their conclusions.338 Mechanical Engineering Design As revealing as Ex. 6–19 is concerning the meaning (and lack of meaning) of a design factor or factor of safety, let us remember that the rotary testing associated with part ( b) changed nothing about the part, but only our knowledge about the part. The mean endurance limit was 40 kpsi all the time, and our adequacy assessment had to move with what was known. Fluctuating Stresses Deterministic failure curves that lie among the data are candidates for regression mod- els. Included among these are the Gerber and ASME-elliptic for ductile materials, and, for brittle materials, Smith-Dolan models, which use mean values in their presentation. Just as the deterministic failure curves are located by endurance strength and ultimate tensile (or yield) strength, so too are stochastic failure curves located by Seand by Sut or Sy. Figure 6–32, p. 320, shows a parabolic Gerber mean curve. We also need to establish a contour located one standard deviation from the mean. Since stochasticbud29281_ch06_265-357.qxd 11/30/2009 4:24 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Fatigue Failure Resulting from Variable Loading 339 curves are most likely to be used with a radial load line we will use the equation given in Table 6–7, p. 307, expressed in terms of the strength means as ¯Sa=r2¯S2 ut 2¯Se⎡ ⎣−1+/radicalBigg 1+/parenleftbigg2¯Se r¯Sut/parenrightbigg2⎤ ⎦ (6–80) Because of the positive correlation between Seand Sut, we increment ¯Seby CSe¯Se, ¯Sut by CSut¯Sut, and ¯Saby CSa¯Sa, substitute into Eq.

The problem distribution of Sewas compounded of historical experience with S/prime eand the uncertainty manifestations due to features requiring Marin considerations. The Gerber “failure zone” displays this. The interference with load-induced stress predicts the risk of failure. If additional infor- mation is known (R. R. Moore testing, with or without Marin features), the stochastic Gerber can accommodate to the information. Usually, the accommodation to additional test information is movement and contraction of the failure zone. In its own way the sto- chastic failure model accomplishes more precisely what the deterministic models and conservative postures intend. Additionally, stochastic models can estimate the probability of failure, something a deterministic approach cannot address. The Design Factor in Fatigue The designer, in envisioning how to execute the geometry of a part subject to the imposed constraints, can begin making a priori decisions without realizing the impact on the design task.

EXAMPLE 6–21 A strap to be made from a cold-drawn steel strip workpiece is to carry a fully reversed axial load F=LN(1000,120)lbf as shown in Fig. 6–39. Consideration of adjacent parts established the geometry as shown in the ﬁgure, except for the thickness t. Make a decision as to the magnitude of the design factor if the reliability goal is to be 0.999 95, then make a decision as to the workpiece thickness t. Solution Let us take each a priori decision and note the consequence: These eight a priori decisions have quantiﬁed the mean design factor as ¯n=2.65.

The 1 2-in thickness attains and, in the rounding to available nominal size, exceeds the reliability goal. The example demonstrates that, for a given reliability goal, the fatigue design factor that facilitates its attainment is decided by the variabilities of the situation. Furthermore, the necessary design factor is not a constant independent of the way the concept unfolds. Rather, it is a function of a number of seemingly unrelated a priori decisions that are made in giving deﬁnition to the concept. The involvement of stochastic methodology can be limited to deﬁning the necessary design factor. In particular, in the example, the design factor is not a function of the design variable t; rather, tfollows from the design factor. 6–18 Road Maps and Important Design Equations for the Stress-Life Method As stated in Sec. 6–15, there are three categories of fatigue problems. The important procedures and equations for deterministic stress-life problems are presented here.

It provides the axis of rotation, or oscillation, of elements such as gears, pulleys, ﬂywheels, cranks, sprockets, and the like and controls the geometry of their motion. An axle is a nonrotating member that carries no torque and is used to support rotating wheels, pulleys, and the like. The automotive axle is not a true axle; the term is a carryover from the horse-and-buggy era, when the wheels rotated on nonrotating members. A nonrotating axle can readily be designed and analyzed as a static beam, and will not warrant the special attention given in this chapter to the rotating shafts which are subject to fatigue loading. There is really nothing unique about a shaft that requires any special treatment beyond the basic methods already developed in previous chapters. However, because of the ubiquity of the shaft in so many machine design applications, there is some advantage in giving the shaft and its design a closer inspection. A complete shaft design has much interdependence on the design of the components. The design of the machine itself will dictate that certain gears, pulleys, bearings, and other elements will have at least been partially analyzed and their size and spacing tentatively determined. Chapter 18 provides a complete case study of a power transmission, focusing on the overall design process. In this chapter, details of the shaft itself will be examined, including the following: •Material selection •Geometric layout •Stress and strength Static strength Fatigue strength •Deﬂection and rigidity Bending deﬂection Torsional deﬂection Slope at bearings and shaft-supported elements Shear deﬂection due to transverse loading of short shafts •Vibration due to natural frequency In deciding on an approach to shaft sizing, it is necessary to realize that a stress analy- sis at a speciﬁc point on a shaft can be made using only the shaft geometry in the vicinity of that point. Thus the geometry of the entire shaft is not needed. In design it is usually possible to locate the critical areas, size these to meet the strength requirements, and then size the rest of the shaft to meet the requirements of the shaft-supported elements. The deﬂection and slope analyses cannot be made until the geometry of the entire shaft has been deﬁned. Thus deﬂection is a function of the geometry everywhere , whereas the stress at a section of interest is a function of local geometry . For this rea- son, shaft design allows a consideration of stress ﬁrst. Then, after tentative values for the shaft dimensions have been established, the determination of the deﬂections and slopes can be made. 7–2 Shaft Materials Deﬂection is not affected by strength, but rather by stiffness as represented by the mod- ulus of elasticity, which is essentially constant for all steels. For that reason, rigidity cannot be controlled by material decisions, but only by geometric decisions.bud29281_ch07_358-408.qxd 12/8/09 12:52PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Shafts and Shaft Components 361 Necessary strength to resist loading stresses affects the choice of materials and their treatments. Many shafts are made from low carbon, cold-drawn or hot-rolled steel, such as ANSI 1020-1050 steels. Signiﬁcant strengthening from heat treatment and high alloy content are often not warranted. Fatigue failure is reduced moderately by increase in strength, and then only to a certain level before adverse effects in endurance limit and notch sensitivity begin to counteract the beneﬁts of higher strength. A good practice is to start with an inex- pensive, low or medium carbon steel for the ﬁrst time through the design calculations. If strength considerations turn out to dominate over deﬂection, then a higher strength material should be tried, allowing the shaft sizes to be reduced until excess deﬂection becomes an issue. The cost of the material and its processing must be weighed against the need for smaller shaft diameters. When warranted, typical alloy steels for heat treat- ment include ANSI 1340-50, 3140-50, 4140, 4340, 5140, and 8650. Shafts usually don’t need to be surface hardened unless they serve as the actual journal of a bearing surface. Typical material choices for surface hardening include carburizing grades of ANSI 1020, 4320, 4820, and 8620. Cold drawn steel is usually used for diameters under about 3 inches. The nom- inal diameter of the bar can be left unmachined in areas that do not require fitting of components. Hot rolled steel should be machined all over. For large shafts requiring much material removal, the residual stresses may tend to cause warping. If con- centricity is important, it may be necessary to rough machine, then heat treat to remove residual stresses and increase the strength, then finish machine to the final dimensions. In approaching material selection, the amount to be produced is a salient factor. For low production, turning is the usual primary shaping process. An economic viewpoint may require removing the least material. High production may permit a volume- conservative shaping method (hot or cold forming, casting), and minimum material in the shaft can become a design goal. Cast iron may be speciﬁed if the production quan- tity is high, and the gears are to be integrally cast with the shaft. Properties of the shaft locally depend on its history—cold work, cold forming, rolling of ﬁllet features, heat treatment, including quenching medium, agitation, and tempering regimen.1 Stainless steel may be appropriate for some environments. 7–3 Shaft Layout The general layout of a shaft to accommodate shaft elements, e.g., gears, bearings, and pulleys, must be speciﬁed early in the design process in order to perform a free body force analysis and to obtain shear-moment diagrams. The geometry of a shaft is gener- ally that of a stepped cylinder. The use of shaft shoulders is an excellent means of axially locating the shaft elements and to carry any thrust loads. Figure 7–1 shows an example of a stepped shaft supporting the gear of a worm-gear speed reducer. Each shoulder in the shaft serves a speciﬁc purpose, which you should attempt to determine by observation. 1See Joseph E. Shigley, Charles R. Mischke, and Thomas H. Brown, Jr. (eds-in-chief), Standard Handbook of Machine Design , 3rd ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 2004.

If there is no existing design to use as a starter, then the determination of the shaft layout may have many solutions. This problem is illustrated by the two examples of Fig. 7–2. In Fig. 7–2 aa geared countershaft is to be supported by two bearings. In Fig. 7–2 ca fanshaft is to be conﬁgured. The solutions shown in Fig. 7–2 band 7–2 dare not neces- sarily the best ones, but they do illustrate how the shaft-mounted devices are ﬁxed and located in the axial direction, and how provision is made for torque transfer from one element to another. There are no absolute rules for specifying the general layout, but the following guidelines may be helpful.Figure 7–1 A vertical worm-gear speed reducer. (Courtesy of the Cleveland Gear Company.) Figure 7–2 (a) Choose a shaft conﬁguration to support and locate the two gears and two bearings. ( b) Solution uses an integral pinion, three shaft shoulders, key and keyway, and sleeve.

In general, it is best to support load-carrying components between bearings, such as in Fig. 7–2 a,rather than cantilevered outboard of the bear- ings, such as in Fig. 7–2 c.Pulleys and sprockets often need to be mounted outboard for ease of installation of the belt or chain. The length of the cantilever should be kept short to minimize the deﬂection. Only two bearings should be used in most cases. For extremely long shafts carrying several load-bearing components, it may be necessary to provide more than two bearing supports. In this case, particular care must be given to the alignment of the bearings. Shafts should be kept short to minimize bending moments and deﬂections. Some axial space between components is desirable to allow for lubricant ﬂow and to provide access space for disassembly of components with a puller. Load bearing components should be placed near the bearings, again to minimize the bending moment at the loca- tions that will likely have stress concentrations, and to minimize the deﬂection at the load-carrying components. The components must be accurately located on the shaft to line up with other mating components, and provision must be made to securely hold the components in position. The primary means of locating the components is to position them against a shoulder of the shaft. A shoulder also provides a solid support to minimize deﬂection and vibration of the component. Sometimes when the magnitudes of the forces are reasonably low, shoulders can be constructed with retaining rings in grooves, sleeves between components, or clamp-on collars. In cases where axial loads are very small, it may be feasible to do without the shoulders entirely, and rely on press ﬁts, pins, or col- lars with setscrews to maintain an axial location. See Fig. 7–2 band 7–2 dfor examples of some of these means of axial location. Supporting Axial Loads In cases where axial loads are not trivial, it is necessary to provide a means to transfer the axial loads into the shaft, then through a bearing to the ground. This will be partic- ularly necessary with helical or bevel gears, or tapered roller bearings, as each of these produces axial force components. Often, the same means of providing axial location, e.g., shoulders, retaining rings, and pins, will be used to also transmit the axial load into the shaft. It is generally best to have only one bearing carry the axial load, to allow greater tolerances on shaft length dimensions, and to prevent binding if the shaft expands due to temperature changes. This is particularly important for long shafts. Figures 7–3 and 7–4 show examples of shafts with only one bearing carrying the axial load against a shoulder, while the other bearing is simply press-fit onto the shaft with no shoulder. Providing for Torque Transmission Most shafts serve to transmit torque from an input gear or pulley, through the shaft, to an output gear or pulley. Of course, the shaft itself must be sized to support the torsional stress and torsional deﬂection. It is also necessary to provide a means of transmitting the torque between the shaft and the gears. Common torque-transfer elements are: •Keys •Splines •Setscrewsbud29281_ch07_358-408.qxd 12/8/09 12:52PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:364 Mechanical Engineering Design •Pins •Press or shrink ﬁts •Tapered ﬁts In addition to transmitting the torque, many of these devices are designed to fail if the torque exceeds acceptable operating limits, protecting more expensive components. Details regarding hardware components such as keys, pins , and setscrews are addressed in detail in Sec. 7–7. One of the most effective and economical means of transmitting moderate to high levels of torque is through a key that ﬁts in a groove in the shaft and gear. Keyed components generally have a slip ﬁt onto the shaft, so assem- bly and disassembly is easy. The key provides for positive angular orientation of the component, which is useful in cases where phase angle timing is important.Figure 7–3 Tapered roller bearings used in a mowing machine spindle. This design represents good practice for the situation in which one or more torque- transfer elements must be mounted outboard. (Source: Redrawn from material furnished by The Timken Company.)

Splines are generally much more expensive to manufacture than keys, and are usually not necessary for simple torque transmission. They are typically used to transfer high torques. One feature of a spline is that it can be made with a reasonably loose slip ﬁt to allow for large axial motion between the shaft and component while still transmitting torque. This is useful for connecting two shafts where relative motion between them is common, such as in connecting a power takeoff (PTO) shaft of a tractor to an implement. SAE and ANSI publish standards for splines. Stress-concentration factors are greatest where the spline ends and blends into the shaft, but are generally quite moderate. For cases of low torque transmission, various means of transmitting torque are available. These include pins, setscrews in hubs, tapered ﬁts, and press ﬁts. Press and shrink ﬁts for securing hubs to shafts are used both for torque transfer and for preserving axial location. The resulting stress-concentration factor is usually quite small. See Sec. 7–8 for guidelines regarding appropriate sizing and tolerancing to transmit torque with press and shrink ﬁts. A similar method is to use a split hub with screws to clamp the hub to the shaft. This method allows for disassembly and lateral adjustments. Another similar method uses a two-part hub consisting of a split inner member that ﬁts into a tapered hole. The assembly is then tightened to the shaft with screws, which forces the inner part into the wheel and clamps the whole assembly against the shaft. Tapered ﬁts between the shaft and the shaft-mounted device, such as a wheel, are often used on the overhanging end of a shaft. Screw threads at the shaft end then permit the use of a nut to lock the wheel tightly to the shaft. This approach is useful because it can be disassembled, but it does not provide good axial location of the wheel on the shaft. At the early stages of the shaft layout, the important thing is to select an appro- priate means of transmitting torque, and to determine how it affects the overall shaft layout. It is necessary to know where the shaft discontinuities, such as keyways, holes, and splines, will be in order to determine critical locations for analysis. Assembly and Disassembly Consideration should be given to the method of assembling the components onto the shaft, and the shaft assembly into the frame. This generally requires the largest diame- ter in the center of the shaft, with progressively smaller diameters towards the ends to allow components to be slid on from the ends. If a shoulder is needed on both sides of a component, one of them must be created by such means as a retaining ring or by a sleeve between two components. The gearbox itself will need means to physically posi- tion the shaft into its bearings, and the bearings into the frame. This is typically accom- plished by providing access through the housing to the bearing at one end of the shaft. See Figs. 7–5 through 7–8 for examples. Figure 7–5 Arrangement showing bearing inner rings press-ﬁtted to shaft while outer rings ﬂoat in the housing. The axial clearance should be sufﬁcient only to allow for machinery vibrations. Note the labyrinth seal on the right.bud29281_ch07_358-408.qxd 12/8/09 12:52PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:366 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 7–6 Similar to the arrangement of Fig. 7–5 except that the outer bearing rings are preloaded. Figure 7–7 In this arrangement the inner ring of the left-hand bearing is locked to the shaft between a nut and a shaft shoulder. The locknut and washer are AFBMA standard. The snap ring in the outer race is used to positively locate the shaft assembly in the axial direction. Note the ﬂoating right-hand bearing and the grinding runout grooves in the shaft. When components are to be press-ﬁt to the shaft, the shaft should be designed so that it is not necessary to press the component down a long length of shaft. This may require an extra change in diameter, but it will reduce manufacturing and assembly cost by only requiring the close tolerance for a short length. Consideration should also be given to the necessity of disassembling the compo- nents from the shaft. This requires consideration of issues such as accessibility of retaining rings, space for pullers to access bearings, openings in the housing to allow pressing the shaft or bearings out, etc. 7–4 Shaft Design for Stress Critical Locations It is not necessary to evaluate the stresses in a shaft at every point; a few potentially critical locations will sufﬁce. Critical locations will usually be on the outer surface, at axial locations where the bending moment is large, where the torque is present, and where stress concentrations exist. By direct comparison of various points along the shaft, a few critical locations can be identiﬁed upon which to base the design. An assessment of typical stress situations will help.Figure 7–8 This arrangement is similar to Fig. 7–7 in that the left-hand bearing positions the entire shaft assembly. In this case the inner ring is secured to the shaft using a snap ring. Note the use of a shield to prevent dirt generated from within the machine from entering the bearing.bud29281_ch07_358-408.qxd 12/8/09 12:52PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Shafts and Shaft Components 367 Most shafts will transmit torque through a portion of the shaft. Typically the torque comes into the shaft at one gear and leaves the shaft at another gear. A free body dia- gram of the shaft will allow the torque at any section to be determined. The torque is often relatively constant at steady state operation. The shear stress due to the torsion will be greatest on outer surfaces. The bending moments on a shaft can be determined by shear and bending moment diagrams. Since most shaft problems incorporate gears or pulleys that introduce forces in two planes, the shear and bending moment diagrams will generally be needed in two planes. Resultant moments are obtained by summing moments as vectors at points of interest along the shaft. The phase angle of the moments is not important since the shaft rotates. A steady bending moment will produce a completely reversed moment on a rotating shaft, as a speciﬁc stress element will alternate from compression to tension in every revolution of the shaft. The normal stress due to bending moments will be greatest on the outer surfaces. In situations where a bearing is located at the end of the shaft, stresses near the bearing are often not critical since the bending moment is small. Axial stresses on shafts due to the axial components transmitted through helical gears or tapered roller bearings will almost always be negligibly small compared to the bending moment stress. They are often also constant, so they contribute little to fatigue. Consequently, it is usually acceptable to neglect the axial stresses induced by the gears and bearings when bending is present in a shaft. If an axial load is applied to the shaft in some other way, it is not safe to assume it is negligible without check- ing magnitudes. Shaft Stresses Bending, torsion, and axial stresses may be present in both midrange and alternating components. For analysis, it is simple enough to combine the different types of stresses into alternating and midrange von Mises stresses, as shown in Sec. 6–14, p. 317. It is sometimes convenient to customize the equations speciﬁcally for shaft applica- tions. Axial loads are usually comparatively very small at critical locations where bending and torsion dominate, so they will be left out of the following equations. The ﬂuctuating stresses due to bending and torsion are given by σa=KfMac Iσm=KfMmc I(7–1) τa=KfsTac Jτm=KfsTmc J(7–2) where Mmand Maare the midrange and alternating bending moments, Tmand Taare the midrange and alternating torques, and KfandKfsare the fatigue stress-concentration factors for bending and torsion, respectively.

These equivalent alternating and midrange stresses can be evaluated using an appropriate failure curve on the modiﬁed Goodman diagram (See Sec. 6–12, p. 303, and Fig. 6–27). For example, the fatigue failure criteria for the modiﬁed Goodman line as expressed previously in Eq. (6–46) is 1 n=σ/prime a Se+σ/prime m Sut Substitution of σ/prime aand σ/prime mfrom Eqs.

(7–5) and (7–6) into any of the failure criteria expressed by Eqs. (6–45) through (6–48), p. 306. The resulting equations for several of the commonly used failure curves are summarized below. The names given to each set of equations identifies the significant failure theory, followed by a fatigue failure locus name. For example, DE-Gerber indicates the stresses are com- bined using the distortion energy (DE) theory, and the Gerber criteria is used for the fatigue failure.

Equations (7–7) through (7–14) can be sim- pliﬁed by setting MmandTaequal to 0, which simply drops out some of the terms. Note that in an analysis situation in which the diameter is known and the factor of safety is desired, as an alternative to using the specialized equations above, it is always still valid to calculate the alternating and mid-range stresses using Eqs. (7–5) and (7–6), and substitute them into one of the equations for the failure criteria, Eqs. (6–45) through (6–48), and solve directly for n. In a design situation, however, having the equations pre-solved for diameter is quite helpful. It is always necessary to consider the possibility of static failure in the ﬁrst load cycle. The Soderberg criteria inherently guards against yielding, as can be seen by noting that its failure curve is conservatively within the yield (Langer) line on Fig. 6–27, p. 305. The ASME Elliptic also takes yielding into account, but is not entirely conservativebud29281_ch07_358-408.qxd 12/9/09 4:29PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:370 Mechanical Engineering Design through out its entire range. This is evident by noting that it crosses the yield line in Fig. 6–27. The Gerber and modiﬁed Goodman criteria do not guard against yielding, requiring a separate check for yielding. A von Mises maximum stress is calculated for this purpose. σ/prime max=/bracketleftbig (σm+σa)2+3(τm+τa)2/bracketrightbig1/2 =/bracketleftBigg/parenleftbigg32Kf(Mm+Ma) πd3/parenrightbigg2 +3/parenleftbigg16Kfs(Tm+Ta) πd3/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg1/2 (7–15) To check for yielding, this von Mises maximum stress is compared to the yield strength, as usual. ny=Sy σ/primemax(7–16) For a quick, conservative check, an estimate for σ/prime maxcan be obtained by simply adding σ/prime aand σ/prime m. (σ/prime a+σ/prime m) will always be greater than or equal to σ/prime max, and will therefore be conservative. EXAMPLE 7–1 At a machined shaft shoulder the small diameter dis 1.100 in, the large diameter Dis 1.65 in, and the ﬁllet radius is 0.11 in. The bending moment is 1260 lbf ·in and the steady torsion moment is 1100 lbf ·in. The heat-treated steel shaft has an ultimate strength of Sut=105 kpsi and a yield strength of Sy=82kpsi.

Estimating Stress Concentrations The stress analysis process for fatigue is highly dependent on stress concentrations. Stress concentrations for shoulders and keyways are dependent on size speciﬁcations that are not known the ﬁrst time through the process. Fortunately, since these elements are usually of standard proportions, it is possible to estimate the stress-concentration factors for initial design of the shaft. These stress concentrations will be ﬁne-tuned in successive iterations, once the details are known. Shoulders for bearing and gear support should match the catalog recommendation for the speciﬁc bearing or gear. A look through bearing catalogs shows that a typical bearing calls for the ratio of D/dto be between 1.2 and 1.5. For a ﬁrst approximation, the worst case of 1.5 can be assumed. Similarly, the ﬁllet radius at the shoulder needs to be sized to avoid interference with the ﬁllet radius of the mating component. There is a signiﬁcant variation in typical bearings in the ratio of ﬁllet radius versus bore diameter, with r/dtypically ranging from around 0.02 to 0.06. A quick look at the stress con- centration charts (Figures A–15–8 and A–15–9) shows that the stress concentrations for bending and torsion increase signiﬁcantly in this range. For example, with D/d=1.5 for bending, Kt=2.7at r/d=0.02, and reduces to Kt=2.1at r/d=0.05, and further down to Kt=1.7at r/d=0.1. This indicates that this is an area where some attention to detail could make a signiﬁcant difference. Fortunately, in most cases the shear and bending moment diagrams show that bending moments are quite low near the bearings, since the bending moments from the ground reaction forces are small. In cases where the shoulder at the bearing is found to be critical, the designer should plan to select a bearing with generous ﬁllet radius, or consider providing for a larger ﬁllet radius on the shaft by relieving it into the base of the shoulder as shown in Fig. 7–9 a.This effectively creates a dead zone in the shoulder area that does not Sharp radius Bearing ShaftLarge radius undercut Stress flow (a)Shoulder relief groove (b)Large radius relief groove (c) Figure 7–9 Techniques for reducing stress concentration at a shoulder supporting a bearing with a sharp radius.

A shoulder relief groove as shown in Fig. 7–9 bcan accomplish a similar purpose. Another option is to cut a large-radius relief groove into the small diameter of the shaft, as shown in Fig. 7–9 c. This has the disadvantage of reducing the cross-sectional area, but is often used in cases where it is useful to provide a relief groove before the shoulder to prevent the grinding or turning operation from having to go all the way to the shoulder. For the standard shoulder fillet, for estimating Ktvalues for the first iteration, an r/dratio should be selected so Ktvalues can be obtained. For the worst end of the spectrum, with r/d=0.02and D/d=1.5,Ktvalues from the stress concentration charts for shoulders indicate 2.7 for bending, 2.2 for torsion, and 3.0 for axial. A keyway will produce a stress concentration near a critical point where the load- transmitting component is located. The stress concentration in an end-milled keyseat is a function of the ratio of the radius rat the bottom of the groove and the shaft diameter d.For early stages of the design process, it is possible to estimate the stress concentration for keyways regardless of the actual shaft dimensions by assuming a typical ratio of r/d=0.02. This gives Kt=2.14for bending and Kts=3.0for torsion, assuming the key is in place. Figures A–15–16 and A–15–17 give values for stress concentrations for ﬂat- bottomed grooves such as used for retaining rings. By examining typical retaining ring speciﬁcations in vendor catalogs, it can be seen that the groove width is typically slightly greater than the groove depth, and the radius at the bottom of the groove is around 1/10 of the groove width. From Figs. A–15–16 and A–15–17, stress-concentration factors for typical retaining ring dimensions are around 5 for bending and axial, and 3 for torsion. Fortunately, the small radius will often lead to a smaller notch sensitivity, reducing Kf. Table 7–1 summarizes some typical stress-concentration factors for the ﬁrst itera- tion in the design of a shaft. Similar estimates can be made for other features. The point is to notice that stress concentrations are essentially normalized so that they are depen- dent on ratios of geometry features, not on the speciﬁc dimensions. Consequently, by estimating the appropriate ratios, the ﬁrst iteration values for stress concentrations can be obtained. These values can be used for initial design, then actual values inserted once diameters have been determined. Table 7–1 First Iteration Estimates for Stress-Concentration Factors KtandKts. Warning: These factors are only estimates for use when actual dimensions are not yet determined. Do notuse these once actual dimensions are available.

See Chap. 18 for the full context. A double reduction gearbox design has developed to the point that the general layout and axial dimensions of the countershaft carrying two spur gears has been proposed, as shown in Fig. 7–10. The gears and bearings are located and supported by shoulders, and held in place by retaining rings. The gears transmit torque through keys. Gears have been specified as shown, allowing the tangential and radial forces transmitted through the gears to the shaft to be determined as follows.

However, unless weight is an issue, there is little advantage to requiring more material removal. Also, the extra rigidity may be needed to keep deflections small.bud29281_ch07_358-408.qxd 12/8/09 12:52PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Shafts and Shaft Components 379 7–5 Deﬂection Considerations Deﬂection analysis at even a single point of interest requires complete geometry infor- mation for the entire shaft. For this reason, it is desirable to design the dimensions at critical locations to handle the stresses, and ﬁll in reasonable estimates for all other dimensions, before performing a deﬂection analysis. Deﬂection of the shaft, both lin- ear and angular, should be checked at gears and bearings. Allowable deﬂections will depend on many factors, and bearing and gear catalogs should be used for guidance on allowable misalignment for speciﬁc bearings and gears. As a rough guideline, typ- ical ranges for maximum slopes and transverse deﬂections of the shaft centerline are given in Table 7–2. The allowable transverse deﬂections for spur gears are dependent on the size of the teeth, as represented by the diametral pitch P/H11005number of teeth/pitch diameter. In Sec. 4–4 several beam deﬂection methods are described. For shafts, where the deﬂections may be sought at a number of different points, integration using either singularity functions or numerical integration is practical. In a stepped shaft, the cross- sectional properties change along the shaft at each step, increasing the complexity of integration, since both Mand Ivary. Fortunately, only the gross geometric dimensions need to be included, as the local factors such as ﬁllets, grooves, and keyways do not have much impact on deﬂection. Example 4–7 demonstrates the use of singularity func- tions for a stepped shaft. Many shafts will include forces in multiple planes, requiring either a three-dimensional analysis, or the use of superposition to obtain deﬂections in two planes which can then be summed as vectors. A deﬂection analysis is straightforward, but it is lengthy and tedious to carry out manually, particularly for multiple points of interest. Consequently, practically all shaft deﬂection analysis will be evaluated with the assistance of software. Any general- purpose ﬁnite-element software can readily handle a shaft problem (see Chap. 19). This is practical if the designer is already familiar with using the software and with how to properly model the shaft. Special-purpose software solutions for 3-D shaft analysis are available, but somewhat expensive if only used occasionally. Software requiring very little training is readily available for planar beam analysis, and can be downloaded from the internet. Example 7–3 demonstrates how to incorporate such a program for a shaft with forces in multiple planes.Slopes Tapered roller 0.0005 –0.0012 rad Cylindrical roller 0.0008 –0.0012 rad Deep-groove ball 0.001 –0.003 rad Spherical ball 0.026 –0.052 rad Self-align ball 0.026 –0.052 rad Uncrowned spur gear <0.0005 rad Transverse Deﬂections Spur gears with P<10 teeth/in 0.010 in Spur gears with 11<P<19 0.005 in Spur gears with 20<P<50 0.003 inTable 7–2 Typical Maximum Ranges for Slopes and Transverse Deﬂectionsbud29281_ch07_358-408.qxd 12/9/09 4:29PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:380 Mechanical Engineering Design Beam length: 11.5 in Deflectioninxy plane Slopedeg Momentlbf-in ShearlbfBeam length: 11.5 in Deflectioninxz plane Slopedeg Momentlbf-in Shearlbf Figure 7–11 Shear, moment, slope, and deﬂection plots from two planes. (Source : Beam 2D Stress Analysis, Orand Systems, Inc.)EXAMPLE 7–3 This example problem is part of a larger case study. See Chap. 18 for the full context. In Ex. 7–2, a preliminary shaft geometry was obtained on the basis of design for stress. The resulting shaft is shown in Fig. 7–10, with proposed diameters of D1=D7=1in D2=D6=1.4in D3=D5=1.625in D4=2.0in Check that the deflections and slopes at the gears and bearings are acceptable. If necessary, propose changes in the geometry to resolve any problems. Solution A simple planar beam analysis program will be used. By modeling the shaft twice, with loads in two orthogonal planes, and combining the results, the shaft deflec- tions can readily be obtained. For both planes, the material is selected (steel with E=30Mpsi), the shaft lengths and diameters are entered, and the bearing loca- tions are specified. Local details like grooves and keyways are ignored, as they will have insignificant effect on the deflections. Then the tangential gear forces are entered in the horizontal xzplane model, and the radial gear forces are entered in the vertical xyplane model. The software can calculate the bearing reaction forces, and numerically integrate to generate plots for shear, moment, slope, and deflection, as shown in Fig. 7–11.bud29281_ch07_358-408.qxd 12/8/09 12:52PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Shafts and Shaft Components 381 The deflections and slopes at points of interest are obtained from the plots, and combined with orthogonal vector addition, that is, δ=/radicalBig δ2xz+δ2xy. Results are shown in Table 7–3. Whether these values are acceptable will depend on the specific bearings and gears selected, as well as the level of performance expected. According to the guidelines in Table 7–2, all of the bearing slopes are well below typical limits for ball bearings. The right bearing slope is within the typical range for cylindrical bearings. Since the load on the right bearing is relatively high, a cylindrical bearing might be used. This constraint should be checked against the specific bearing specifications once the bearing is selected. The gear slopes and deflections more than satisfy the limits recommended in Table 7–2. It is recommended to proceed with the design, with an awareness that changes that reduce rigidity should warrant another deflection check.Point of Interest xzPlane xy Plane Total Left bearing slope 0.02263 deg 0.01770 deg 0.02872 deg 0.000501 rad Right bearing slope 0.05711 deg 0.02599 deg 0.06274 deg 0.001095 rad Left gear slope 0.02067 deg 0.01162 deg 0.02371 deg 0.000414 rad Right gear slope 0.02155 deg 0.01149 deg 0.02442 deg 0.000426 rad Left gear deﬂection 0.0007568 in 0.0005153 in 0.0009155 in Right gear deﬂection 0.0015870 in 0.0007535 in 0.0017567 in Table 7–3 Slope and Deﬂection Values at Key Locations Once deﬂections at various points have been determined, if any value is larger than the allowable deﬂection at that point, since Iis proportional to d4, a new diameter can be found from dnew=dold/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglendyold yall/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1/4 (7–17) where yallis the allowable deﬂection at that station and ndis the design factor. Similarly, if any slope is larger than the allowable slope θall, a new diameter can be found from dnew=dold/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglend(dy/dx)old (slope) all/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1/4 (7–18) where (slope) allis the allowable slope. As a result of these calculations, determine the largest dnew/doldratio, then multiply alldiameters by this ratio. The tight constraint will be just tight, and all others will be loose. Don’t be too concerned about end journal sizes, as their inﬂuence is usually negligible. The beauty of the method is that the deﬂections need to be completed just once and constraints can be rendered loose but for one, with diameters all identiﬁed without reworking every deﬂection.bud29281_ch07_358-408.qxd 12/9/09 4:29PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:382 Mechanical Engineering Design 2C.R.

Bruce Hopkins, Design Analysis of Shafts and Beams, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1970, pp. 93–99.The transverse shear Vat a section of a beam in ﬂexure imposes a shearing deﬂec- tion, which is superposed on the bending deﬂection. Usually such shearing deﬂection is less than 1 percent of the transverse bending deﬂection, and it is seldom evaluated. However, when the shaft length-to-diameter ratio is less than 10, the shear component of transverse deﬂection merits attention. There are many short shafts. A tabular method is explained in detail elsewhere2, including examples. For right-circular cylindrical shafts in torsion the angular deﬂection θis given in Eq. (4–5). For a stepped shaft with individual cylinder length liand torque Ti, the angular deﬂection can be estimated from θ=/summationdisplay θi=/summationdisplay Tili GiJi(7–19) or, for a constant torque throughout homogeneous material, from θ=T G/summationdisplayli Ji(7–20) This should be treated only as an estimate, since experimental evidence shows that the actual θis larger than given by Eqs. (7–19) and (7–20).3EXAMPLE 7–4 For the shaft in Ex. 7–3, it was noted that the slope at the right bearing is near the limit for a cylindrical roller bearing. Determine an appropriate increase in diameters to bring this slope down to 0.0005 rad. Solution Applying Eq. (7–17) to the deﬂection at the right bearing gives dnew=dold/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglendslope old slope all/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1/4 =1.0/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(1)(0.001095) (0.0005)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1/4 =1.216 in Multiplying all diameters by the ratio dnew dold=1.216 1.0=1.216 gives a new set of diameters, D1=D7=1.216in D2=D6=1.702in D3=D5=1.976in D4=2.432in Repeating the beam deﬂection analysis of Ex. 7–3 with these new diameters produces a slope at the right bearing of 0.0005 in, with all other deﬂections less than their previ- ous values.bud29281_ch07_358-408.qxd 12/8/09 12:52PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:If torsional stiffness is defined as ki=Ti/θiand, since θi=Ti/kiand θ=/summationtextθi=/summationtext(Ti/ki), for constant torque θ=T/summationtext(1/ki), it follows that the torsional stiffness of the shaft kin terms of segment stiffnesses is 1 k=/summationdisplay1 ki(7–21) 7–6 Critical Speeds for Shafts When a shaft is turning, eccentricity causes a centrifugal force deﬂection, which is resisted by the shaft’s ﬂexural rigidity EI. As long as deﬂections are small, no harm is done. Another potential problem, however, is called critical speeds: at certain speeds the shaft is unstable, with deﬂections increasing without upper bound. It is fortunate that although the dynamic deﬂection shape is unknown, using a static deﬂection curve gives an excellent estimate of the lowest critical speed. Such a curve meets the bound- ary condition of the differential equation (zero moment and deﬂection at both bearings) and the shaft energy is not particularly sensitive to the exact shape of the deﬂection curve. Designers seek ﬁrst critical speeds at least twice the operating speed. The shaft, because of its own mass, has a critical speed. The ensemble of attach- ments to a shaft likewise has a critical speed that is much lower than the shaft’s intrin- sic critical speed. Estimating these critical speeds (and harmonics) is a task of the designer. When geometry is simple, as in a shaft of uniform diameter, simply supported, the task is easy. It can be expressed4as ω1=/parenleftbiggπ l/parenrightbigg2/radicalbigg EI m=/parenleftbiggπ l/parenrightbigg2/radicalBigg gEI Aγ(7–22) where mis the mass per unit length, Athe cross-sectional area, and γthe speciﬁc weight.

Rayleigh’s equation overestimates the critical speed. To counter the increasing complexity of detail, we adopt a useful viewpoint. Inasmuch as the shaft is an elastic body, we can use inﬂuence coefﬁcients . An inﬂuence coefﬁcient is the transverse deﬂection at location ion a shaft due to a unit load at loca- tion jon the shaft.

The resistance to axial motion of the collar or hub relative to the shaft is called holding power . This holding power, which is really a force resistance, is due to frictional resistance of the contact- ing portions of the collar and shaft as well as any slight penetration of the setscrew into the shaft.bud29281_ch07_358-408.qxd 12/8/09 12:52PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Figure 7–15 shows the point types available with socket setscrews.

Typical factors of safety are 1.5 to 2.0 for static loads and 4 to 8 for various dynamic loads. Setscrews should have a length of about half of the shaft diameter. Note that this practice also provides a rough rule for the radial thickness of a hub or collar. Keys and Pins Keys and pins are used on shafts to secure rotating elements, such as gears, pulleys, or other wheels. Keys are used to enable the transmission of torque from the shaft to the shaft-supported element. Pins are used for axial positioning and for the transfer of torque or thrust or both. Figure 7–16 shows a variety of keys and pins. Pins are useful when the principal loading is shear and when both torsion and thrust are present. Taper pins are sized according to the diameter at the large end. Some of the most useful sizes of these are listed in Table 7–5. The diameter at the small end is d=D−0.0208 L (7–35) where d/H11005diameter at small end, in D/H11005diameter at large end, in L/H11005length, in390 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 7–16 (a) Square key; ( b) round key; (cand d) round pins; ( e) taper pin; ( f) split tubular spring pin.

A large vari- ety of these are listed in manufacturers’ catalogs.7 The square key, shown in Fig. 7–16 a, is also available in rectangular sizes. Standard sizes of these, together with the range of applicable shaft diameters, are listed in Table 7–6. The shaft diameter determines standard sizes for width, height, and key depth. The designer chooses an appropriate key length to carry the torsional load. Failure of the key can be by direct shear, or by bearing stress. Example 7–6 demonstrates the process to size the length of a key. The maximum length of a key is limited by the hub length of the attached element, and should generally not exceed about 1.5 times the shaft diameter to avoid excessive twisting with the angular deﬂection of the shaft. Multiple keys may be used as necessary to carry greater loads, typically oriented at 90° from one another. Excessive safety factors should be avoided in key design, since it is desirable in an over- load situation for the key to fail, rather than more costly components. Stock key material is typically made from low carbon cold-rolled steel, and is manufactured such that its dimensions never exceed the nominal dimension. This allows standard cutter sizes to be used for the keyseats. A setscrew is sometimes used along with a key to hold the hub axially, and to minimize rotational backlash when the shaft rotates in both directions.Table 7–6 Inch Dimensions for Some Standard Square- and Rectangular-Key Applications Source: Joseph E.

This also gives the advantage that the hub position can be adjusted for the best axial location. The head makes removal possible without access to the other end, but the projection may be hazardous. The Woodruff key, shown in Fig. 7–17 b, is of general usefulness, especially when a wheel is to be positioned against a shaft shoulder, since the keyslot need not be machined into the shoulder stress concentration region. The use of the Woodruff key also yields bet- ter concentricity after assembly of the wheel and shaft. This is especially important at high speeds, as, for example, with a turbine wheel and shaft. Woodruff keys are particularly use- ful in smaller shafts where their deeper penetration helps prevent key rolling. Dimensions for some standard Woodruff key sizes can be found in Table 7–7, and Table 7–8 gives the shaft diameters for which the different keyseat widths are suitable. Pilkey8gives values for stress concentrations in an end-milled keyseat, as a func- tion of the ratio of the radius rat the bottom of the groove and the shaft diameter d. For ﬁllets cut by standard milling-machine cutters, with a ratio of r/d=0.02, Peterson’s charts give Kt=2.14for bending and Kts=2.62for torsion without the key in place, or Kts=3.0for torsion with the key in place. The stress concentration at the end of the keyseat can be reduced somewhat by using a sled-runner keyseat, eliminating the abrupt end to the keyseat, as shown in Fig. 7–17. It does, however, still have the sharp radius in the bottom of the groove on the sides. The sled-runner key- seat can only be used when deﬁnite longitudinal key positioning is not necessary. It is also not as suitable near a shoulder. Keeping the end of a keyseat at least a distance392 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 7–17 (a) Gib-head key; (b) Woodruff key.

As shown in Fig. 7–18, a groove is cut in the shaft or bore to receive the spring retainer. For sizes, dimensions, and axial load ratings, the manufacturers’ catalogs should be consulted. Appendix Tables A–15–16 and A–15–17 give values for stress-concentration fac- tors for ﬂat-bottomed grooves in shafts, suitable for retaining rings. For the rings to seat nicely in the bottom of the groove, and support axial loads against the sides of the groove, the radius in the bottom of the groove must be reasonably sharp, typically about one-tenth of the groove width. This causes comparatively high values for stress- concentration factors, around 5 for bending and axial, and 3 for torsion. Care should be taken in using retaining rings, particularly in locations with high bending stresses.394 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 7–19t bF F ra 9Ibid, p. 381.EXAMPLE 7–6 A UNS G10350 steel shaft, heat-treated to a minimum yield strength of 75 kpsi, has a diameter of 17 16in. The shaft rotates at 600 rev/min and transmits 40 hp through a gear. Select an appropriate key for the gear. Solution A 3 8-in square key is selected, UNS G10200 cold-drawn steel being used. The design will be based on a yield strength of 65 kpsi. A factor of safety of 2.80 will be employed in the absence of exact information about the nature of the load.

Preferred Metric Limits and Fits, ANSI B4.2-1978.7–8 Limits and Fits The designer is free to adopt any geometry of ﬁt for shafts and holes that will ensure the intended function. There is sufﬁcient accumulated experience with commonly recurring situations to make standards useful. There are two standards for limits and ﬁts in the United States, one based on inch units and the other based on metric units.10These differ in nomenclature, deﬁnitions, and organization. No point would be served by separately studying each of the two systems. The metric version is the newer of the two and is well organized, and so here we present only the metric version but include a set of inch con- versions to enable the same system to be used with either system of units. In using the standard, c apital letters always refer to the hole; lowercase letters are used for the shaft . The deﬁnitions illustrated in Fig. 7–20 are explained as follows: •Basic size is the size to which limits or deviations are assigned and is the same for both members of the ﬁt. •Deviation is the algebraic difference between a size and the corresponding basic size. •Upper deviation is the algebraic difference between the maximum limit and the corresponding basic size. •Lower deviation is the algebraic difference between the minimum limit and the corresponding basic size. •Fundamental deviation is either the upper or the lower deviation, depending on which is closer to the basic size. •Tolerance is the difference between the maximum and minimum size limits of a part. •International tolerance grade numbers (IT) designate groups of tolerances such that the tolerances for a particular IT number have the same relative level of accuracy but vary depending on the basic size. •Hole basis represents a system of ﬁts corresponding to a basic hole size. The funda- mental deviation is H.bud29281_ch07_358-408.qxd 12/8/09 12:52PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:•Shaft basis represents a system of ﬁts corresponding to a basic shaft size. The fundamental deviation is h. The shaft-basis system is not included here. The magnitude of the tolerance zone is the variation in part size and is the same for both the internal and the external dimensions. The tolerance zones are speciﬁed in international tolerance grade numbers, called IT numbers. The smaller grade numbers specify a smaller tolerance zone. These range from IT0 to IT16, but only grades IT6 to IT11 are needed for the preferred ﬁts. These are listed in Tables A–11 to A–14 for basic sizes up to 16 in or 400 mm. The standard uses tolerance position letters, with capital letters for internal dimensions (holes) and lowercase letters for external dimensions (shafts). As shown in Fig. 7–20, the fundamental deviation locates the tolerance zone relative to the basic size. Table 7–9 shows how the letters are combined with the tolerance grades to estab- lish a preferred ﬁt. The ISO symbol for the hole for a sliding ﬁt with a basic size of 32 mm is 32H7. Inch units are not a part of the standard. However, the designation (13 8in) H7 includes the same information and is recommended for use here. In both cases, the capital letter H establishes the fundamental deviation and the number 7 deﬁnes a tolerance grade of IT7. For the sliding ﬁt, the corresponding shaft dimensions are deﬁned by the symbol 32g6 [( 13 8in)g6]. The fundamental deviations for shafts are given in Tables A–11 and A–13.

Solution From Table 7–9, the ISO symbol is 34H11/c11. From Table A–11, we ﬁnd that toler- ance grade IT11 is 0.160 mm. The symbol 34H11/c11 therefore says that /Delta1D=/Delta1d= 0.160mm. Using Eq. (7–36) for the hole, we get Answer Dmax=D+/Delta1D=34+0.160=34.160 mm Answer Dmin=D=34.000 mm The shaft is designated as a 34c11 shaft. From Table A–12, the fundamental deviation is δF=−0.120mm. Using Eq. (7–37), we get for the shaft dimensions Answer dmax=d+δF=34+(−0.120)=33.880 mm Answer dmin=d+δF−/Delta1d=34+(−0.120)−0.160=33.720 mm398 Mechanical Engineering Design EXAMPLE 7–8 Find the hole and shaft limits for a medium drive ﬁt using a basic hole size of 2 in. Solution The symbol for the ﬁt, from Table 7–8, in inch units is (2 in)H7/s6. For the hole, we use Table A–13 and ﬁnd the IT7 grade to be /Delta1D=0.0010 in. Thus, from Eq. (7–36), Answer Dmax=D+/Delta1D=2+0.0010=2.0010 in Answer Dmin=D=2.0000 in The IT6 tolerance for the shaft is /Delta1d=0.0006 in. Also, from Table A–14, the fundamental deviation is δF=0.0017 in. Using Eq. (7–38), we get for the shaft that Answer dmin=d+δF=2+0.0017=2.0017 in Answer dmax=d+δF+/Delta1d=2+0.0017+0.0006=2.0023 in Stress and Torque Capacity in Interference Fits Interference ﬁts between a shaft and its components can sometimes be used effectively to minimize the need for shoulders and keyways. The stresses due to an interference ﬁt can be obtained by treating the shaft as a cylinder with a uniform external pressure, and the hub as a hollow cylinder with a uniform internal pressure. Stress equations for these situations were developed in Sec. 3–16, and will be converted here from radius terms into diameter terms to match the terminology of this section. bud29281_ch07_358-408.qxd 12/8/09 12:52PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:The pressure pgenerated at the interface of the interference ﬁt, from Eq.

The term δis the diametral interference between the shaft and hub, that is, the differ- ence between the shaft outside diameter and the hub inside diameter. δ=dshaft−dhub (7–41) Since there will be tolerances on both diameters, the maximum and minimum pres- sures can be found by applying the maximum and minimum interferences. Adopting the notation from Fig. 7–20, we write δmin=dmin−Dmax (7–42) δmax=dmax−Dmin (7–43) where the diameter terms are deﬁned in Eqs. (7–36) and (7–38). The maximum inter- ference should be used in Eq. (7–39) or (7–40) to determine the maximum pressure to check for excessive stress. From Eqs. (3–58) and (3–59), with radii converted to diameters, the tangential stresses at the interface of the shaft and hub are σt,shaft=− pd2+d2 i d2−d2 i(7–44) σt,hub=pd2 o+d2 d2o−d2(7–45) The radial stresses at the interface are simply σr,shaft=− p (7–46) σr,hub=− p (7–47) The tangential and radial stresses are orthogonal, and should be combined using a failure theory to compare with the yield strength. If either the shaft or hub yields during assembly, the full pressure will not be achieved, diminishing the torque that can be trans- mitted. The interaction of the stresses due to the interference ﬁt with the other stresses in the shaft due to shaft loading is not trivial. Finite-element analysis of the interface would be appropriate when warranted. A stress element on the surface of a rotating shaft will experience a completely reversed bending stress in the longitudinal direction, as well as the steady compressive stresses in the tangential and radial directions. This is a three- dimensional stress element. Shear stress due to torsion in shaft may also be present. Since the stresses due to the press ﬁt are compressive, the fatigue situation is usually actually improved. For this reason, it may be acceptable to simplify the shaft analysis by ignoringShafts and Shaft Components 399bud29281_ch07_358-408.qxd 12/8/09 12:52PM ntt 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:the steady compressive stresses due to the press ﬁt. There is, however, a stress concen- tration effect in the shaft bending stress near the ends of the hub, due to the sudden change from compressed to uncompressed material. The design of the hub geometry, and there- fore its uniformity and rigidity, can have a signiﬁcant effect on the speciﬁc value of the stress-concentration factor, making it difﬁcult to report generalized values. For ﬁrst esti- mates, values are typically not greater than 2. The amount of torque that can be transmitted through an interference ﬁt can be esti- mated with a simple friction analysis at the interface. The friction force is the product of the coefﬁcient of friction fand the normal force acting at the interface. The normal force can be represented by the product of the pressure pand the surface area Aof inter- face. Therefore, the friction force Ffis Ff=fN=f(pA)=f[p2π(d/2)l]=πfp ld (7–48) where lis the length of the hub. This friction force is acting with a moment arm of d/2 to provide the torque capacity of the joint, so T=Ffd/2=πfp ld(d/2) T=(π/2)fp ld2(7–49) The minimum interference, from Eq. (7–42), should be used to determine the min- imum pressure to check for the maximum amount of torque that the joint should be designed to transmit without slipping.

The ﬁgure shows the shaft, the gear, and the bear- ings. The shaft has been giving trouble—in fact, two of them have already failed—and the down time on the machine is so expensive that you ha ve decided to redesign the shaft yourself rather than order replacements.

It is the basis of power screws, which change angular motion to linear motion to transmit power or to develop large forces (presses, jacks, etc.), and threaded fas- teners, an important element in nonpermanent joints. This book presupposes a knowledge of the elementary methods of fastening. Typ- ical methods of fastening or joining parts use such devices as bolts, nuts, cap screws, setscrews, rivets, spring retainers, locking devices, pins, keys, welds, and adhesives. Studies in engineering graphics and in metal processes often include instruction on var- ious joining methods, and the curiosity of any person interested in mechanical engi- neering naturally results in the acquisition of a good background knowledge of fasten- ing methods. Contrary to ﬁrst impressions, the subject is one of the most interesting in the entire ﬁeld of mechanical design. One of the key targets of current design for manufacture is to reduce the number of fasteners. However, there will always be a need for fasteners to facilitate disas- sembly for whatever purposes. For example, jumbo jets such as Boeing’s 747 require as many as 2.5 million fasteners, some of which cost several dollars apiece. To keep costs down, aircraft manufacturers, and their subcontractors, constantly review new fastener designs, installation techniques, and tooling. The number of innovations in the fastener ﬁeld over any period you might care to mention has been tremendous. An overwhelming variety of fasteners are available for the designer’s selection. Serious designers generally keep speciﬁc notebooks on fasteners alone. Methods of joining parts are extremely important in the engineering of a quality design, and it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of the per- formance of fasteners and joints under all conditions of use and design. 8–1 Thread Standards and Deﬁnitions The terminology of screw threads, illustrated in Fig. 8–1, is explained as follows: The pitch is the distance between adjacent thread forms measured parallel to the thread axis. The pitch in U.S. units is the reciprocal of the number of thread forms per inch N. The major diameter d is the largest diameter of a screw thread. The minor ( or root) diameter dris the smallest diameter of a screw thread. The pitch diameter dpis a theoretical diameter between the major and minor diameters. The lead l , not shown, is the distance the nut moves parallel to the screw axis when the nut is given one turn. For a single thread, as in Fig. 8–1, the lead is the same as the pitch. A multiple-threaded product is one having two or more threads cut beside each other (imagine two or more strings wound side by side around a pencil). Standard- ized products such as screws, bolts, and nuts all have single threads; a double-threaded screw has a lead equal to twice the pitch, a triple-threaded screw has a lead equal to 3 times the pitch, and so on. All threads are made according to the right-hand rule unless otherwise noted. That is, if the bolt is turned clockwise, the bolt advances toward the nut. The American National (Uniﬁed) thread standard has been approved in this coun- try and in Great Britain for use on all standard threaded products. The thread angle is 60◦and the crests of the thread may be either ﬂat or rounded. Figure 8–2 shows the thread geometry of the metric M and MJ proﬁles. The M proﬁle replaces the inch class and is the basic ISO 68 proﬁle with 60◦symmetricbud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Screws, Fasteners, and the Design of Nonpermanent Joints 411 Major diameter Pitch diameter Minor diameter Pitch p 45° chamfe r Thread angle 2 αRoot CrestFigure 8–1 Terminology of screw threads.

The MJ proﬁle has a rounded ﬁllet at the root of the external thread and a larger minor diameter of both the internal and external threads. This proﬁle is espe- cially useful where high fatigue strength is required. Tables 8–1 and 8–2 will be useful in specifying and designing threaded parts. Note that the thread size is speciﬁed by giving the pitch pfor metric sizes and by giving the number of threads per inch Nfor the Uniﬁed sizes. The screw sizes in Table 8–2 with diameter under 1 4in are numbered or gauge sizes. The second column in Table 8–2 shows that a No. 8 screw has a nominal major diameter of 0.1640 in. A great many tensile tests of threaded rods have shown that an unthreaded rod having a diameter equal to the mean of the pitch diameter and minor diameter will have the same tensile strength as the threaded rod. The area of this unthreaded rod is called the tensile-stress area Atof the threaded rod; values of Atare listed in both tables. Two major Uniﬁed thread series are in common use: UN and UNR. The differ- ence between these is simply that a root radius must be used in the UNR series. Because of reduced thread stress-concentration factors, UNR series threads have improved fatigue strengths. Uniﬁed threads are speciﬁed by stating the nominal major diameter, the number of threads per inch, and the thread series, for example,5 8in-18 UNRF or 0.625in-18 UNRF. Metric threads are speciﬁed by writing the diameter and pitch in millimeters, in that order. Thus, M12 ×1.75 is a thread having a nominal major diameter of 12 mm and a pitch of 1.75 mm. Note that the letter M, which precedes the diameter, is the clue to the metric designation.bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:412 Mechanical Engineering Design NominalCoarse-Pitch Series Fine-Pitch Series Major Tensile- Minor- Tensile- Minor- Diameter Pitch Stress Diameter Pitch Stress Diameter dp Area AtArea Ar p Area AtArea Ar mm mm mm2mm2mm mm2mm2 1.6 0.35 1.27 1.07 2 0.40 2.07 1.79 2.5 0.45 3.39 2.98 3 0.5 5.03 4.47 3.5 0.6 6.78 6.00 4 0.7 8.78 7.75 5 0.8 14.2 12.7 6 1 20.1 17.9 8 1.25 36.6 32.8 1 39.2 36.0 10 1.5 58.0 52.3 1.25 61.2 56.3 12 1.75 84.3 76.3 1.25 92.1 86.0 14 2 115 104 1.5 125 116 16 2 157 144 1.5 167 157 20 2.5 245 225 1.5 272 259 24 3 353 324 2 384 365 30 3.5 561 519 2 621 596 36 4 817 759 2 915 884 42 4.5 1120 1050 2 1260 1230 48 5 1470 1380 2 1670 1630 56 5.5 2030 1910 2 2300 2250 64 6 2680 2520 2 3030 2980 72 6 3460 3280 2 3860 3800 80 6 4340 4140 1.5 4850 4800 90 6 5590 5360 2 6100 6020 100 6 6990 6740 2 7560 7470 110 2 9180 9080 *The equations and data used to develop this table have been obtained from ANSI B1.1-1974 and B18.3.1-1978.

Table 8–3 lists the pre- ferred pitches for inch-series Acme threads. However, other pitches can be and often are used, since the need for a standard for such threads is not great. Modiﬁcations are frequently made to both Acme and square threads. For instance, the square thread is sometimes modiﬁed by cutting the space between the teeth so as to have an included thread angle of 10 to 15◦. This is not difﬁcult, since these threads are usually cut with a single-point tool anyhow; the modiﬁcation retains most of the high efﬁciency inherent in square threads and makes the cutting simpler.

Familiar applications include the lead screws of lathes, and the screws for vises, presses, and jacks. An application of power screws to a power-driven jack is shown in Fig. 8–4. You should be able to identify the worm, the worm gear, the screw, and the nut.

In Fig. 8–5 a square-threaded power screw with single thread having a mean diameter dm, a pitch p, a lead angle λ, and a helix angle ψis loaded by the axial compressive force F. We wish to ﬁnd an expression for the torque required to raise this load, and another expression for the torque required to lower the load. First, imagine that a single thread of the screw is unrolled or developed (Fig. 8–6) for exactly a single turn. Then one edge of the thread will form the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose base is the circumference of the mean-thread-diameter circle and whose height is the lead. The angle λ, in Figs. 8–5 and 8–6, is the lead angle of the thread. We represent the summation of all the axial forces acting upon the normal thread area by F. To raise the load, a force PRacts to the right (Fig. 8–6 a), and to lower the load, PLacts to the left (Fig. 8–6 b). The friction force is the product of the coefﬁcient of friction f with the normal force N, and acts to oppose the motion. The system is in equilibrium under the action of these forces, and hence, for raising the load, we have /summationdisplay Fx=PR−Nsinλ−fNcosλ=0 (a)/summationdisplay Fy=− F−fNsinλ+Ncosλ=0 In a similar manner, for lowering the load, we have /summationdisplay Fx=− PL−Nsinλ+fNcosλ=0 (b)/summationdisplay Fy=− F+fNsinλ+Ncosλ=0bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:416 Mechanical Engineering Design Since we are not interested in the normal force N, we eliminate it from each of these sets of equations and solve the result for P. For raising the load, this gives PR=F(sinλ+fcosλ) cosλ−fsinλ(c) and for lowering the load, PL=F(fcosλ−sinλ) cosλ+fsinλ(d) Next, divide the numerator and the denominator of these equations by cosλand use the relation tanλ=l/πdm(Fig. 8–6). We then have, respectively, PR=F[(l/πdm)+f] 1−(fl/πdm)(e) PL=F[f−(l/πdm)] 1+(fl/πdm)(f) Finally, noting that the torque is the product of the force Pand the mean radius dm/2, for raising the load we can write TR=Fdm 2/parenleftbiggl+πfdm πdm−fl/parenrightbigg (8–1) where TRis the torque required for two purposes: to overcome thread friction and to raise the load. The torque required to lower the load, from Eq. ( f), is found to be TL=Fdm 2/parenleftbiggπfdm−l πdm+fl/parenrightbigg (8–2) This is the torque required to overcome a part of the friction in lowering the load. It may turn out, in speciﬁc instances where the lead is large or the friction is low, that the load will lower itself by causing the screw to spin without any external effort. In such cases, the torque TLfrom Eq. (8–2) will be negative or zero. When a positive torque is obtained from this equation, the screw is said to be self-locking . Thus the condition for self-locking is πfdm>l Now divide both sides of this inequality by πdm. Recognizing that l/πdm=tanλ, we get f>tanλ (8–3) This relation states that self-locking is obtained whenever the coefﬁcient of thread friction is equal to or greater than the tangent of the thread lead angle. An expression for efﬁciency is also useful in the evaluation of power screws. If we let f=0in Eq. (8–1), we obtain T0=Fl 2π(g)bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Screws, Fasteners, and the Design of Nonpermanent Joints 417 Thread angleColla r NutF cos /H9251 F⁄2 (b) (a)F⁄2F 2/H9251 =/H9251 F⁄2 F⁄2dc Figure 8–7 (a) Normal thread force is increased because of angle α; (b) thrust collar has frictional diameter dc.which, since thread friction has been eliminated, is the torque required only to raise the load. The efﬁciency is therefore e=T0 TR=Fl 2πTR(8–4) The preceding equations have been developed for square threads where the nor- mal thread loads are parallel to the axis of the screw. In the case of Acme or other threads, the normal thread load is inclined to the axis because of the thread angle 2α and the lead angle λ. Since lead angles are small, this inclination can be neglected and only the effect of the thread angle (Fig. 8–7 a) considered. The effect of the angle αis to increase the frictional force by the wedging action of the threads. Therefore the frictional terms in Eq. (8–1) must be divided by cosα. For raising the load, or for tightening a screw or bolt, this yields TR=Fdm 2/parenleftbiggl+πfdmsecα πdm−flsecα/parenrightbigg (8–5) In using Eq. (8–5), remember that it is an approximation because the effect of the lead angle has been neglected. For power screws, the Acme thread is not as efﬁcient as the square thread, because of the additional friction due to the wedging action, but it is often preferred because it is easier to machine and permits the use of a split nut, which can be adjusted to take up for wear. Usually a third component of torque must be applied in power-screw applications. When the screw is loaded axially, a thrust or collar bearing must be employed between the rotating and stationary members in order to carry the axial component. Figure 8–7 b shows a typical thrust collar in which the load is assumed to be concentrated at the mean collar diameter dc. If fcis the coefﬁcient of collar friction, the torque required is Tc=Ffcdc 2(8–6) For large collars, the torque should probably be computed in a manner similar to that employed for disk clutches. Nominal body stresses in power screws can be related to thread parameters as follows. The maximum nominal shear stress τin torsion of the screw body can be expressed as τ=16T πd3r(8–7)bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:418 Mechanical Engineering Design dm FfF y x FTp/2p/2Figure 8–8 Geometry of square thread useful in ﬁnding bending and transverse shear stresses at the thread root.The axial stress σin the body of the screw due to load Fis σ=F A=4F πd2r(8–8) in the absence of column action.

(5–14) of Sec. 5–5. The screw-thread form is complicated from an analysis viewpoint. Remember the origin of the tensile-stress area At, which comes from experiment. A power screw lift- ing a load is in compression and its thread pitch is shortened by elastic deformation. Its engaging nut is in tension and its thread pitch is lengthened . The engaged threads cannot share the load equally. Some experiments show that the ﬁrst engaged thread carries 0.38 of the load, the second 0.25, the third 0.18, and the seventh is free of load. In estimating thread stresses by the equations above, substituting 0.38Ffor Fand set- ting ntto 1 will give the largest level of stresses in the thread-nut combination. EXAMPLE 8–1 A square-thread power screw has a major diameter of 32 mm and a pitch of 4 mm with double threads, and it is to be used in an application similar to that in Fig. 8–4.

Table 8–6 shows coefﬁcients of starting and running friction for common material pairs. 8–3 Threaded Fasteners As you study the sections on threaded fasteners and their use, be alert to the stochastic and deterministic viewpoints. In most cases the threat is from overproof loading of fasteners, and this is best addressed by statistical methods. The threat from fatigue is lower, and deterministic methods can be adequate. Figure 8–9 is a drawing of a standard hexagon-head bolt. Points of stress con- centration are at the ﬁllet, at the start of the threads (runout), and at the thread-root ﬁllet in the plane of the nut when it is present. See Table A–29 for dimensions. The diameter of the washer face is the same as the width across the ﬂats of the hexagon. The thread length of inch-series bolts, where dis the nominal diameter, is LT=/braceleftBigg 2d+1 4in L≤6i n 2d+1 2in L>6i n(8–13) and for metric bolts is LT=⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩2d+6 2d+12 125 < 2d+25L≤125 d≤48 L≤200 L>200(8–14) where the dimensions are in millimeters. The ideal bolt length is one in which only one or two threads project from the nut after it is tightened. Bolt holes may have burrs or sharp edges after drilling. These could bite into the ﬁllet and increase stress con- centration. Therefore, washers must always be used under the bolt head to prevent this. They should be of hardened steel and loaded onto the bolt so that the rounded edge of the stamped hole faces the washer face of the bolt. Sometimes it is necessary to use washers under the nut too. The purpose of a bolt is to clamp two or more parts together. The clamping load stretches or elongates the bolt; the load is obtained by twisting the nut until the boltScrewNut Material Material Steel Bronze Brass Cast Iron Steel, dry 0.15–0.25 0.15–0.23 0.15–0.19 0.15–0.25 Steel, machine oil 0.11–0.17 0.10–0.16 0.10–0.15 0.11–0.17 Bronze 0.08–0.12 0.04–0.06 — 0.06–0.09Table 8–5 Coefﬁcients of Friction f for Threaded Pairs Source: H.

This illustration uses one of the conventional methods of representing threads. has elongated almost to the elastic limit. If the nut does not loosen, this bolt tension remains as the preload or clamping force. When tightening, the mechanic should, if possible, hold the bolt head stationary and twist the nut; in this way the bolt shank will not feel the thread-friction torque. The head of a hexagon-head cap screw is slightly thinner than that of a hexagon- head bolt. Dimensions of hexagon-head cap screws are listed in Table A–30. Hexagon-head cap screws are used in the same applications as bolts and also in appli- cations in which one of the clamped members is threaded. Three other common cap- screw head styles are shown in Fig. 8–10. A variety of machine-screw head styles are shown in Fig. 8–11. Inch-series machine screws are generally available in sizes from No. 0 to about 3 8in. Several styles of hexagonal nuts are illustrated in Fig. 8–12; their dimensions are given in Table A–31. The material of the nut must be selected carefully to match that of the bolt. During tightening, the ﬁrst thread of the nut tends to take the entire load; but yielding occurs, with some strengthening due to the cold work that takes place, and the load is eventually divided over about three nut threads. For this reason you should never reuse nuts; in fact, it can be dangerous to do so.1 64H Approx. in 30°RWbud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:424 Mechanical Engineering Design A HD L (a) Round headA D LH A(b) Flat head A HD L (c) Fillister headD LH (d) Oval head A HD L (e) Truss head W HD L (g) Hex head (trimmed) 80 to 82 ° 80 to 82 ° RA D L (f) Binding head5° ±3° W HD L (h) Hex head (upset)Figure 8–11 Types of heads used on machine screws. 30/H11034 30/H11034Approx. inW H (a)( b)( c)( d)( e)30/H11034H H 30/H11034HApprox. in1 641 64Figure 8–12 Hexagonal nuts: ( a) end view, general; ( b) washer-faced regular nut; ( c) regular nut chamfered on both sides; (d) jam nut with washer face; (e) jam nut chamfered on both sides. 8–4 Joints—Fastener Stiffness When a connection is desired that can be disassembled without destructive methods and that is strong enough to resist external tensile loads, moment loads, and shear loads, or a combination of these, then the simple bolted joint using hardened-steel washers is a good solution. Such a joint can also be dangerous unless it is properly designed and assembled by a trained mechanic.bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Screws, Fasteners, and the Design of Nonpermanent Joints 425 P P P PlFigure 8–13 A bolted connection loaded in tension by the forces P.

Note the use of an O-ring seal. lis the effective grip of the connection (see Table 8–7). A section through a tension-loaded bolted joint is illustrated in Fig. 8–13. Notice the clearance space provided by the bolt holes. Notice, too, how the bolt threads extend into the body of the connection. As noted previously, the purpose of the bolt is to clamp the two, or more, parts together. Twisting the nut stretches the bolt to produce the clamping force. This clamping force is called the pretension orbolt preload . It exists in the connection after the nut has been properly tightened no matter whether the external tensile load Pis exerted or not. Of course, since the members are being clamped together, the clamping force that produces tension in the bolt induces compression in the members. Figure 8–14 shows another tension-loaded connection. This joint uses cap screws threaded into one of the members. An alternative approach to this problem (of not using a nut) would be to use studs. A stud is a rod threaded on both ends. The stud is screwed into the lower member ﬁrst; then the top member is positioned and fastened down with hardened washers and nuts. The studs are regarded as permanent, and so the joint can be disassembled merely by removing the nut and washer. Thus the threaded part of the lower member is not damaged by reusing the threads. The spring rate is a limit as expressed in Eq. (4–1). For an elastic member such as a bolt, as we learned in Eq. (4–2), it is the ratio between the force applied to the member and the deﬂection produced by that force. We can use Eq. (4–4) and the results of Prob. 4–1 to ﬁnd the stiffness constant of a fastener in any bolted connection. The grip lof a connection is the total thickness of the clamped material. In Fig. 8–13 the grip is the sum of the thicknesses of both members and both washers. In Fig. 8–14 the effective grip is given in Table 8–7. The stiffness of the portion of a bolt or screw within the clamped zone will gen- erally consist of two parts, that of the unthreaded shank portion and that of thebud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/19/2009 11:34 am pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:426 Mechanical Engineering Design l LldLTh t t2 t1ld d lLT LtltH lt (a) (b)d Given fastener diameter d and pitch pin mm or number of threads per inch Washer thickness: tfrom Table A–32 or A–33 Nut thickness [Fig. ( a) only]: Hfrom Table A–31 Grip length: For Fig. ( a): l/H11005thickness of all material squeezed between face of bolt and face of nut For Fig. ( b): l=/braceleftbiggh+t2/2,t2<d h+d/2,t2≥d Fastener length (round up using Table A–17*): For Fig. ( a): L>l+H For Fig. ( b): L>h+1.5d Threaded length LT: Inch series: LT=/braceleftBigg 2d+1 4in, L≤6i n 2d+1 2in, L>6i n Metric series: LT=⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩2d+6m m, 2d+12 mm , 2d+25 mm ,L≤125 mm ,d≤48 mm 125<L≤200 mm L>200 mm Length of unthreaded portion in grip: ld=L−LT Length of threaded portion in grip: lt=l−ld Area of unthreaded portion: Ad=πd2/4 Area of threaded portion: Atfrom Table 8–1 or 8–2 Fastener stiffness: kb=AdAtE Adlt+AtldTable 8–7 Suggested Procedure for Finding Fastener Stiffness *Bolts and cap screws may not be available in all the preferred lengths listed in Table A–17.

Thus the stiffness constant of the bolt is equivalent to the stiffnesses of two springs in series. Using the results of Prob. 4–1, we ﬁnd 1 k=1 k1+1 k2or k=k1k2 k1+k2(8–15) for two springs in series. From Eq. (4–4), the spring rates of the threaded and unthreaded portions of the bolt in the clamped zone are, respectively, kt=AtE ltkd=AdE ld(8–16) where At=tensile-stress area (Tables 8–1, 8–2) lt=length of threaded portion of grip Ad=major-diameter area of fastener ld=length of unthreaded portion in grip Substituting these stiffnesses in Eq. (8–15) gives kb=AdAtE Adlt+Atld(8–17) where kbis the estimated effective stiffness of the bolt or cap screw in the clamped zone. For short fasteners, the one in Fig. 8–14, for example, the unthreaded area is small and so the ﬁrst of the expressions in Eq. (8–16) can be used to ﬁnd kb. For long fasteners, the threaded area is relatively small, and so the second expression in Eq. (8–16) can be used. Table 8–7 is useful. 8–5 Joints—Member Stiffness In the previous section, we determined the stiffness of the fastener in the clamped zone. In this section, we wish to study the stiffnesses of the members in the clamped zone. Both of these stiffnesses must be known in order to learn what happens when the assembled connection is subjected to an external tensile loading. There may be more than two members included in the grip of the fastener. All together these act like compressive springs in series, and hence the total spring rate of the members is 1 km=1 k1+1 k2+1 k3+···+1 ki(8–18) If one of the members is a soft gasket, its stiffness relative to the other members is usually so small that for all practical purposes the others can be neglected and only the gasket stiffness used. If there is no gasket, the stiffness of the members is rather difﬁcult to obtain, except by experimentation, because the compression region spreads out between the bolt head and the nut and hence the area is not uniform. There are, however, some cases in which this area can be determined. Ito2has used ultrasonic techniques to determine the pressure distribution at the mem- ber interface. The results show that the pressure stays high out to about 1.5 bolt radii. 2Y . Ito, J. Toyoda, and S. Nagata, “Interface Pressure Distribution in a Bolt-Flange Assembly,” ASME paper no. 77-WA/DE-11, 1977.bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:428 Mechanical Engineering Design The pressure, however, falls off farther away from the bolt. Thus Ito suggests the use of Rotscher’s pressure-cone method for stiffness calculations with a variable cone angle. This method is quite complicated, and so here we choose to use a simpler approach using a ﬁxed cone angle. Figure 8–15 illustrates the general cone geometry using a half-apex angle α. An angle α=45◦has been used, but Little3reports that this overestimates the clamping stiffness. When loading is restricted to a washer-face annulus (hardened steel, cast iron, or aluminum), the proper apex angle is smaller. Osgood4reports a range of 25◦≤α≤33◦for most combinations. In this book we shall use α=30◦except in cases in which the material is insufﬁcient to allow the frusta to exist.

Then individual stiffnesses are assembled to obtain kmusing Eq. (8–18). If the members of the joint have the same Young’s modulus Ewith symmetrical frusta back to back, then they act as two identical springs in series. From Eq. (8–18) we learn that km=k/2. Using the grip as l=2tand dwas the diameter of the washer face, from Eq. (8–19) we ﬁnd the spring rate of the members to be km=πEdtanα 2l n(ltanα+dw−d)(dw+d) (ltanα+dw+d)(dw−d)(8–21) The diameter of the washer face is about 50 percent greater than the fastener diame- ter for standard hexagon-head bolts and cap screws. Thus we can simplify Eq. (8–21) by letting dw=1.5d. If we also use α=30◦, then Eq.

Wileman, Choudury, and Green5conducted a ﬁnite element study of this problem. The results, which are depicted in Fig. 8–16, agree with the α=30◦recommendation, coinciding exactly at the aspect ratio d/l=0.4. Addition- ally, they offered an exponential curve-ﬁt of the form km Ed=Aexp(Bd/l) (8–23) with constants AandBdeﬁned in Table 8–8. Equation (8–23) offers a simple calcu- lation for member stiffness km. However, it is very important to note that the entire joint must be made up of the same material . For departure from these conditions, Eq. (8–20) remains the basis for approaching the problem.bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:430 Mechanical Engineering Design Material Poisson Elastic Modulus Used Ratio GPa Mpsi AB Steel 0.291 207 30.0 0.787 15 0.628 73 Aluminum 0.334 71 10.3 0.796 70 0.638 16 Copper 0.326 119 17.3 0.795 68 0.635 53 Gray cast iron 0.211 100 14.5 0.778 71 0.616 16 General expression 0.789 52 0.629 14Table 8–8 Stiffness Parameters of Various Member Materials† †Source: J.

The proof load is the maximum load (force) that a bolt can withstand without acquiring a permanent set. The proof strength is the quotient of the proof load and the tensile-stress area. The proof strength thus corresponds roughly to the proportional limit and corresponds to 0.0001-in permanent set in the fastener (ﬁrst measurable deviation from elastic behavior). Tables 8–9, 8–10, and 8–11 provide minimum strength speciﬁcations for steel bolts. The values of the mean proof strength, the mean tensile strength, and the corresponding standard deviations are not part of the speciﬁcation codes, so it is the designer’s responsibility to obtain these values, perhaps by laboratory testing, if designing to a reliability speciﬁcation. The SAE speciﬁcations are found in Table 8–9. The bolt grades are numbered according to the tensile strengths, with decimals used for variations at the same strength level. Bolts and screws are available in all grades listed. Studs are available in grades 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 8.1. Grade 8.1 is not listed. ASTM speciﬁcations are listed in Table 8–10. ASTM threads are shorter because ASTM deals mostly with structures; structural connections are generally loaded in shear, and the decreased thread length provides more shank area. Speciﬁcations for metric fasteners are given in Table 8–11. It is worth noting that all speciﬁcation-grade bolts made in this country bear a man- ufacturer’s mark or logo, in addition to the grade marking, on the bolt head. Such marks conﬁrm that the bolt meets or exceeds speciﬁcations. If such marks are missing, the bolt may be imported; for imported bolts there is no obligation to meet speciﬁcations. Bolts in fatigue axial loading fail at the ﬁllet under the head, at the thread runout, and at the ﬁrst thread engaged in the nut. If the bolt has a standard shoulder under the head, it has a value of Kffrom 2.1 to 2.3, and this shoulder ﬁllet is protectedbud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Screws, Fasteners, and the Design of Nonpermanent Joints 433 Table 8–9 SAE Speciﬁcations for Steel Bolts Size Minimum Minimum Minimum SAE Range Proof Tensile Yield Grade Inclusive, Strength,* Strength,* Strength,* No. in kpsi kpsi kpsi Material Head Marking 11 4–11 233 60 36 Low or medium carbon 21 4–3 455 74 57 Low or medium carbon 7 8–11 233 60 36 41 4–11 265 115 100 Medium carbon, cold-drawn 51 4–1 85 120 92 Medium carbon, Q&T 11 8–11 274 105 81 5.21 4–1 85 120 92 Low-carbon martensite, Q&T 71 4–11 2105 133 115 Medium-carbon alloy, Q&T 81 4–11 2120 150 130 Medium-carbon alloy, Q&T 8.2 1 4–1 120 150 130 Low-carbon martensite, Q&T *Minimum strengths are strengths exceeded by 99 percent of fasteners. from scratching or scoring by a washer. If the thread runout has a 15◦or less half-cone angle, the stress is higher at the ﬁrst engaged thread in the nut. Bolts are sized by examining the loading at the plane of the washer face of the nut. This is the weakest part of the bolt if and only if the conditions above are satisﬁed (washer protection of the shoulder ﬁllet and thread runout ≤15◦). Inattention to this requirement has led to a record of 15 percent fastener fatigue failure under the head, 20 percent at thread runout, and 65 percent where the designer is focusing attention. It does little good to concentrate on the plane of the nut washer face if it is not the weakest location. Nuts are graded so that they can be mated with their corresponding grade of bolt. The purpose of the nut is to have its threads deﬂect to distribute the load of the bolt more evenly to the nut. The nut’s properties are controlled in order to accomplish this. The grade of the nut should be the grade of the bolt.bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:434 Mechanical Engineering Design Table 8–10 ASTM Speciﬁcations for Steel Bolts ASTM Size Minimum Minimum Minimum Desig- Range, Proof Tensile Yield nation Inclusive, Strength,* Strength,* Strength,* No. in kpsi kpsi kpsi Material Head Marking A3071 4–11 233 60 36 Low carbon A325,1 2–1 85 120 92 Medium carbon, Q&T type 111 8–11 274 105 81 A325,1 2–1 85 120 92 Low-carbon, martensite, type 2 11 8–11 274 105 81Q&T A325,1 2–1 85 120 92 Weathering steel, type 311 8–11 274 105 81Q&T A354,1 4–21 2105 125 109 Alloy steel, Q&T grade BC23 4–4 95 115 99 A354,1 4–4 120 150 130 Alloy steel, Q&T grade BD A4491 4–1 85 120 92 Medium-carbon, Q&T 11 8–11 274 105 81 13 4–3 55 90 58 A490,1 2–11 2120 150 130 Alloy steel, Q&T type 1 A490, 1 2–11 2120 150 130 Weathering steel, type 3 Q&T *Minimum strengths are strengths exceeded by 99 percent of fasteners.A325 A325 A325 BC A490 A490bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Screws, Fasteners, and the Design of Nonpermanent Joints 435 Minimum Minimum Minimum Size Proof Tensile Yield Property Range, Strength,†Strength,†Strength,† Class Inclusive MPa MPa MPa Material Head Marking 4.6 M5–M36 225 400 240 Low or medium carbon 4.8 M1.6–M16 310 420 340 Low or medium carbon 5.8 M5–M24 380 520 420 Low or medium carbon 8.8 M16–M36 600 830 660 Medium carbon, Q&T 9.8 M1.6–M16 650 900 720 Medium carbon, Q&T 10.9 M5–M36 830 1040 940 Low-carbon martensite, Q&T 12.9 M1.6–M36 970 1220 1100 Alloy, Q&T *The thread length for bolts and cap screws is LT=⎧ ⎨ ⎩2d+6 2d+12 2d+25L≤125 125<L≤200 L>200 where Lis the bolt length.

It is to be assumed, of course, that the clamping force, which we will call the preload Fi, has been correctly applied by tightening the nut before P is applied. The nomenclature used is: Fi=preload Ptotal=Total external tensile load applied to the jointbud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:436 Mechanical Engineering Design P=external tensile load per bolt Pb=portion of Ptaken by bolt Pm=portion of Ptaken by members Fb=Pb+Fi=resultant bolt load Fm=Pm−Fi=resultant load on members C=fraction of external load Pcarried by bolt 1−C=fraction of external load Pcarried by members N=Number of bolts in the joint If Nbolts equally share the total external load, then P=Ptotal/N (a) The load Pis tension, and it causes the connection to stretch, or elongate, through some distance δ. We can relate this elongation to the stiffnesses by recalling that kis the force divided by the deﬂection. Thus δ=Pb kband δ=Pm km(b) or Pm=Pbkm kb(c) Since P=Pb+Pm, we have Pb=kbP kb+km=CP (d) and Pm=P−Pb=(1−C)P (e) where C=kb kb+km(f) is called the stiffness constant of the joint . The resultant bolt load is Fb=Pb+Fi=CP+Fi Fm<0 (8–24) and the resultant load on the connected members is Fm=Pm−Fi=(1−C)P−Fi Fm<0 (8–25) Of course, these results are valid only as long as some clamping load remains in the members; this is indicated by the qualiﬁer in the equations. Table 8–12 is included to provide some information on the relative values of the stiffnesses encountered. The grip contains only two members, both of steel, and nobud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Screws, Fasteners, and the Design of Nonpermanent Joints 437 washers. The ratios Cand 1−Care the coefﬁcients of Pin Eqs. (8–24) and (8–25), respectively. They describe the proportion of the external load taken by the bolt and by the members, respectively. In all cases, the members take over 80 percent of the external load. Think how important this is when fatigue loading is present. Note also that making the grip longer causes the members to take an even greater percentage of the external load. 8–8 Relating Bolt Torque to Bolt Tension Having learned that a high preload is very desirable in important bolted connections, we must next consider means of ensuring that the preload is actually developed when the parts are assembled. If the overall length of the bolt can actually be measured with a micrometer when it is assembled, the bolt elongation due to the preload Fican be computed using the formula δ=Fil/(AE). Then the nut is simply tightened until the bolt elongates through the distance δ. This ensures that the desired preload has been attained. The elongation of a screw cannot usually be measured, because the threaded end is often in a blind hole. It is also impractical in many cases to measure bolt elongation. In such cases the wrench torque required to develop the speciﬁed preload must be estimated. Then torque wrenching, pneumatic-impact wrenching, or the turn-of-the-nut method may be used. The torque wrench has a built-in dial that indicates the proper torque. With impact wrenching, the air pressure is adjusted so that the wrench stalls when the proper torque is obtained, or in some wrenches, the air automatically shuts off at the desired torque. The turn-of-the-nut method requires that we ﬁrst deﬁne the meaning of snug-tight. The snug-tight condition is the tightness attained by a few impacts of an impact wrench, or the full effort of a person using an ordinary wrench. When the snug-tight condition is attained, all additional turning develops useful tension in the bolt. The turn-of-the-nut method requires that you compute the fractional number of turns nec- essary to develop the required preload from the snug-tight condition. For example, for heavy hexagonal structural bolts, the turn-of-the-nut speciﬁcation states that the nut should be turned a minimum of 180◦from the snug-tight condition under optimum conditions. Note that this is also about the correct rotation for the wheel nuts of a pas- senger car. Problems 8–15 to 8–17 illustrate the method further. Although the coefﬁcients of friction may vary widely, we can obtain a good estimate of the torque required to produce a given preload by combining Eqs.

(8–26) is that K.=0.20for f=fc=0.15no matter what size bolts are employed and no matter whether the threads are coarse or ﬁne. Blake and Kurtz have published results of numerous tests of the torquing of bolts.6 By subjecting their data to a statistical analysis, we can learn something about the distribution of the torque coefﬁcients and the resulting preload. Blake and Kurtz deter- mined the preload in quantities of unlubricated and lubricated bolts of size 1 2in-20 UNF when torqued to 800 lbf ·in. This corresponds roughly to an M12 ×1.25 bolt torqued to 90 N ·m. The statistical analyses of these two groups of bolts, converted to SI units, are displayed in Tables 8–13 and 8–14. We ﬁrst note that both groups have about the same mean preload, 34 kN. The unlubricated bolts have a standard deviation of 4.9 kN and a COV of about 0.15. The lubricated bolts have a standard deviation of 3 kN and a COV of about 0.9. The means obtained from the two samples are nearly identical, approximately 34 kN; using Eq. (8–27), we ﬁnd, for both samples, K=0.208. Bowman Distribution, a large manufacturer of fasteners, recommends the values shown in Table 8–15. In this book we shall use these values and use K=0.2when the bolt condition is not stated. 6J. C. Blake and H. J.

The tensile stress in the bolt can be found as in Ex. 8–3 as σb=Fb At=CP+Fi At(a) Thus, the yielding factor of safety guarding against the static stress exceeding the proof strength is np=Sp σb=Sp (CP+Fi)/At(b) or np=SpAt CP+Fi(8–28) Since it is common to load a bolt close to the proof strength, the yielding factor of safety is often not much greater than unity. Another indicator of yielding that is some- times used is a load factor, which is applied only to the load Pas a guard against overloading. Applying such a load factor to the load Pin Eq. ( a), and equating it to the proof strength gives Cn LP+Fi At=Sp (c) Solving for the load factor gives nL=SpAt−Fi CP(8–29) It is also essential for a safe joint that the external load be smaller than that needed to cause the joint to separate. If separation does occur, t hen the entire external loadbud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Screws, Fasteners, and the Design of Nonpermanent Joints 441 will be imposed on the bolt. Let P0be the value of the external load that would cause joint separation. At separation, Fm=0in Eq. (8–25), and so (1−C)P0−Fi=0 (d) Let the factor of safety against joint separation be n0=P0 P(e) Substituting P0=n0Pin Eq. ( d), we ﬁnd n0=Fi P(1−C)(8–30) as a load factor guarding against joint separation. Figure 8–18 is the stress-strain diagram of a good-quality bolt material. Notice that there is no clearly deﬁned yield point and that the diagram progresses smoothly up to fracture, which corresponds to the tensile strength. This means that no matter how much preload is given the bolt, it will retain its load-carrying capacity. This is what keeps the bolt tight and determines the joint strength. The pretension is the “muscle” of the joint, and its magnitude is determined by the bolt strength. If the full bolt strength is not used in developing the pretension, then money is wasted and the joint is weaker. Good-quality bolts can be preloaded into the plastic range to develop more strength. Some of the bolt torque used in tightening produces torsion, which increases the principal tensile stress. However, this torsion is held only by the friction of the bolt head and nut; in time it relaxes and lowers the bolt tension slightly. Thus, as a rule, a bolt will either fracture during tightening, or not at all. Above all, do not rely too much on wrench torque; it is not a good indicator of preload. Actual bolt elongation should be used whenever possible—especially with fatigue loading. In fact, if high reliability is a requirement of the design, then preload should always be determined by bolt elongation. Russell, Burdsall & Ward Inc.

Solution (a) The grip is l=1.50in. From Table A–31, the nut thickness is 35 64in. Adding two threads beyond the nut of 2 11in gives a bolt length of L=35 64+1.50+2 11=2.229 in From Table A–17 the next fraction size bolt is L=21 4in. From Eq. (8–13), the thread length is LT=2(0.625)+0.25=1.50in. Thus, the length of the unthreaded portion(85 kpsi up to a diameter of 1 in).7Bowman8recommends a preload of 75 percent of proof load, which is about the same as the RB&W recommendations for reused bolts. In view of these guidelines, it is recommended for both static and fatigue loading that the following be used for preload: Fi=/braceleftbigg0.75Fp for nonpermanent connections, reused fasteners 0.90Fp for permanent connections(8–31) where Fpis the proof load, obtained from the equation Fp=AtSp (8–32) Here Spis the proof strength obtained from Tables 8–9 to 8–11. For other materials, an approximate value is Sp=0.85Sy. Be very careful not to use a soft material in a threaded fastener. For high-strength steel bolts used as structural steel connectors, if advanced tightening methods are used, tighten to yield. You can see that the RB&W recommendations on preload are in line with what we have encountered in this chapter. The purposes of development were to give the reader the perspective to appreciate Eqs. (8–31) and a methodology with which to handle cases more speciﬁcally than the recommendations.bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Screws, Fasteners, and the Design of Nonpermanent Joints 443 in the grip is ld=2.25−1.50=0.75in.

Thus, for Nbolts, p=−Fm Ag/N(a) With a load factor n, Eq. (8–25) can be written as Fm=(1−C)nP−Fi (b) Substituting this into Eq. ( a) gives the gasket pressure as p=[Fi−nP(1−C)]N Ag(8–33) In full-gasketed joints uniformity of pressure on the gasket is important. To main- tain adequate uniformity of pressure adjacent bolts should not be placed more than six nominal diameters apart on the bolt circle. To maintain wrench clearance, bolts should be placed at least three diameters apart. A rough rule for bolt spacing around a bolt circle is 3≤πDb Nd≤6 (8–34) where Dbis the diameter of the bolt circle and Nis the number of bolts. 8–11 Fatigue Loading of Tension Joints Tension-loaded bolted joints subjected to fatigue action can be analyzed directly by the methods of Chap. 6. Table 8–16 lists average fatigue stress-concentration factors for the ﬁllet under the bolt head and also at the beginning of the threads on the bolt shank. These are already corrected for notch sensitivity and for surface finish. Designers should be aware that situations may arise in which it would be advisable to investigate these factors more closely, since they are only average values. In fact, Peterson9observes that the distribution of typical bolt failures is about 15 percent under the head, 20 percent at the end of the thread, and 65 percent in the thread at the nut face. Use of rolled threads is the predominant method of thread-forming in screw fas- teners, where Table 8–16 applies. In thread-rolling, the amount of cold work and strain- strengthening is unknown to the designer; therefore, fully corrected (including Kf) axial endurance strength is reported in Table 8–17. For cut threads, the methods of Chap. 6 are useful. Anticipate that the endurance strengths will be considerably lower. 9W. D.

The Goodman failure line is also shown in Fig. 8–20. The fatigue factor of safety can be found by intersecting the load line and the Goodman line to ﬁnd the intersection point ( Sm, Sa). The load line is given by Load line: Sa=σa σm−σi(Sm−σi) (a) The Goodman line, rearranging Eq. (6–40), p. 306, is Goodman line: Sa=Se−Se SutSm (b) Equating Eqs.

( c) into Eq. (8–37) gives nf=Se(Sut−σi) Sutσa+Se(σm−σi)(8–38) The same approach can be used for the other failure curves, though the algebra is a bit more tedious to put in equation form such as Eq. (8–38). An easier approach would be to solve in stages numerically, ﬁrst Sm, then Sa, and ﬁnally nf. Often, the type of fatigue loading encountered in the analysis of bolted joints is one in which the externally applied load ﬂuctuates between zero and some maximum force P. This would be the situation in a pressure cylinder, for example, where a pressure either exists or does not exist. For such cases, Eqs. (8–35) and (8–36) can be simpliﬁed by setting Pmax=Pand Pmin=0, resulting in σa=CP 2At(8–39) σm=CP 2At+Fi At(8–40) Note that Eq. (8–40) can be viewed as the sum of the alternating stress and the pre- load stress. If the preload is considered to be constant, the load line relationship between the alternating and midrange stresses can be treated as σm=σa+σi (8–41) This load line has a slope of unity, and is a special case of the load line shown in Fig. 8–20. With the simpliﬁcations in the algebra, we can now proceed as before to obtain the fatigue factor of safety using each of the typical failure criteria, duplicated here from Eqs. (6–40), (6–41), and (6–42).Se Sa /H9268aLoad lineAlternating stress /H9268a Steady stress /H9268mB A Fi /H9268m/H9268i = AtDC Sm SutFigure 8–20 Designer’s fatigue diagram showing a Goodman failure line and a commonly used load line for a constant preload and a ﬂuctuating load.bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Screws, Fasteners, and the Design of Nonpermanent Joints 447 Goodman: Sa Se+Sm Sut=1 (8–42) Gerber: Sa Se+/parenleftbiggSm Sut/parenrightbigg2 =1 (8–43) ASME-elliptic: /parenleftbiggSa Se/parenrightbigg2 +/parenleftbiggSm Sp/parenrightbigg2 =1 (8–44) Now if we intersect Eq.

(8–45) to (8–47) are only applicable for repeated loads. Be sure to use Kffor both σaand σm. Otherwise, the slope of the load line will not remain 1 to 1. If desired, σafrom Eq. (8–39) and σi=Fi/Atcan be directly substituted into any of Eqs. (8–45) to (8–47). If we do so for the Goodman criteria in Eq. (8–45), we obtain nf=2Se(SutAt−Fi) CP(Sut+Se)(8–48) when preload Fiis present. With no preload, C=1, Fi=0, and Eq. (8–48) becomes nf0=2SeSutAt P(Sut+Se)(8–49) Preload is beneficial for resisting fatigue when nf/nf0is greater than unity. For Goodman, Eqs. (8–48) and (8–49) with nf/nf0≥1puts an upper bound on the pre- load Fiof Fi≤(1−C)SutAt (8–50) If this cannot be achieved, and nfis unsatisfactory, use the Gerber or ASME-elliptic criterion to obtain a less conservative assessment. If the design is still not satisfactory, additional bolts and/or a different size bolt may be called for.bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:448 Mechanical Engineering Design Bolts loosen, as they are friction devices, and cyclic loading and vibration as well as other effects allow the fasteners to lose tension with time. How does one ﬁght loosening? Within strength limitations, the higher the preload the better. A rule of thumb is that pre- loads of 60 percent of proof load rarely loosen. If more is better, how much more? Well, not enough to create reused fasteners as a future threat. Alternatively, fastener-locking schemes can be employed. After solving for the fatigue factor of safety, you should also check the possibility of yielding, using the proof strength np=Sp σm+σa(8–51) which is equivalent to Eq. (8–28).

The joint is subjected to a ﬂuctu- ating force whose maximum value is 5 kip per screw. The required data are: cap screw, 5/8i n - 1 1 NC, SAE 5; hardened-steel washer, tw=1 16in thick; steel cover plate, t1= 5 8in,Es=30 Mpsi; and cast-iron base, t2=5 8in,Eci=16Mpsi. (a) Find kb, km, and Cusing the assumptions given in the caption of Fig. 8–21. (b) Find all factors of safety and explain what they mean. Solution (a) For the symbols of Figs. 8–15 and 8–21, h=t1+tw=0.6875 in, l=h+d/2= 1 in, and D2=1.5d=0.9375 in. The joint is composed of three frusta; the upper two frusta are steel and the lower one is cast iron. For the upper frustum: t=l/2=0.5in, D=0.9375 in, and E=30Mpsi. Using these values in Eq. (8–20) gives k1=46.46Mlbf/in. For the middle frustum: t=h−l/2=0.1875 in and D=0.9375+2(l−h) tan30◦=1.298in. With these and Es=30Mpsi, Eq. (8–20) gives k2=197.43Mlbf/in. The lower frustum has D=0.9375 in, t=l−h=0.3125 in, and Eci=16Mpsi. The same equation yields k3=32.39Mlbf/in. Substituting these three stiffnesses into Eq. (8–18) gives km=17.40Mlbf/in. The cap screw is short and threaded all the way. Using l=1in for the grip and At=0.226 in2from Table 8–2, we find the stiffness to be kb=AtE/l=6.78 Mlbf/in. Thus the joint constant is Answer C=kb kb+km=6.78 6.78+17.40=0.280bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Screws, Fasteners, and the Design of Nonpermanent Joints 449 (b) Equation (8–30) gives the preload as Fi=0.75Fp=0.75AtSp=0.75(0.226)(85)=14.4 kip where from Table 8–9, Sp=85kpsi for an SAE grade 5 cap screw. Using Eq. (8–28), we obtain the load factor as the yielding factor of safety is Answer np=SpAt CP+Fi=85(0.226) 0.280(5)+14.4=1.22 This is the traditional factor of safety, which compares the maximum bolt stress to the proof strength.

Point Brepresents the stress state σa,σm. Point A is the preload stress σi. Therefore the load line begins at Aand makes an angle having a unit slope. This angle is 45° only when both stress axes have the same scale. The factors of safety are found by dividing the distances AC, AD, and AEby the distance AB. Note that this is the same as dividing Safor each theory by σa. The quantities shown in the caption of Fig. 8–22 are obtained as follows: Point A σi=Fi At=14.4 0.226=63.72 kpsi Point B σa=CP 2At=0.280(5) 2(0.226)=3.10 kpsi σm=σa+σi=3.10+63.72=66.82 kpsi Point C This is the modiﬁed Goodman criteria. From Table 8–17, we ﬁnd Se=18.6kpsi. Then, using Eq. (8–45), the factor of safety is found to be Answer nf=Se(Sut−σi) σa(Sut+Se)=18.6(120−63.72) 3.10(120+18.6)=2.44 Point D This is on the proof-strength line where Sm+Sa=Sp (1) In addition, the horizontal projection of the load line ADis Sm=σi+Sa (2) Solving Eqs. (1) and (2) simultaneously results in Sa=Sp−σi 2=85−63.72 2=10.64 kpsi The factor of safety resulting from this is Answer np=Sa σa=10.64 3.10=3.43 which, of course, is identical to the result previously obtained by using Eq. (8–29). A similar analysis of a fatigue diagram could have been done using yield strength instead of proof strength. Though the two strengths are somewhat related, proof strength is a much better and more positive indicator of a fully loaded bolt than is the yield strength. It is also worth remembering that proof-strength values are speciﬁed in design codes; yield strengths are not. We found nf=2.44on the basis of fatigue and the modiﬁed Goodman line, and np=3.43on the basis of proof strength. Thus the danger of failure is by fatigue, not by overproof loading. These two factors should always be compared to determine where the greatest danger lies.bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/18/09 2:52 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Screws, Fasteners, and the Design of Nonpermanent Joints 451 Point E For the Gerber criterion, from Eq.

Figure 8–22 clearly shows the conﬂict where point Dlies between points Cand E.Again, the conservative nature of the Goodman criterion explains the discrepancy and the designer must form his or her own conclusion. 8–12 Bolted and Riveted Joints Loaded in Shear10 Riveted and bolted joints loaded in shear are treated exactly alike in design and analysis. Figure 8–23 ashows a riveted connection loaded in shear. Let us now study the various means by which this connection might fail. Figure 8–23 bshows a failure by bending of the rivet or of the riveted members. The bending moment is approximately M=Ft/2, where Fis the shearing force and tis the grip of the rivet, that is, the total thickness of the connected parts. The bend- ing stress in the members or in the rivet is, neglecting stress concentration, σ=M I/c(8–52) where I/cis the section modulus for the weakest member or for the rivet or rivets, depending upon which stress is to be found. The calculation of the bending stress in this manner is an assumption, because we do not know exactly how the load is dis- tributed to the rivet or the relative deformations of the rivet and the members. Although this equation can be used to determine the bending stress, it is seldom used in design; instead its effect is compensated for by an increase in the factor of safety. In Fig. 8–23 cfailure of the rivet by pure shear is shown; the stress in the rivet is τ=F A(8–53) where Ais the cross-sectional area of all the rivets in the group. It may be noted that it is standard practice in structural design to use the nominal diameter of the rivet rather than the diameter of the hole, even though a hot-driven rivet expands and nearly ﬁlls up the hole. 10The design of bolted and riveted connections for boilers, bridges, buildings, and other structures in which danger to human life is involved is strictly governed by various construction codes. When designing these structures, the engineer should refer to the American Institute of Steel Construction Handbook, the American Railway Engineering Association speciﬁcations, or the Boiler Construction Code of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Rupture of one of the connected members or plates by pure tension is illustrated in Fig. 8–23 d. The tensile stress is σ=F A(8–54) where Ais the net area of the plate, that is, the area reduced by an amount equal to the area of all the rivet holes. For brittle materials and static loads and for either duc- tile or brittle materials loaded in fatigue, the stress-concentration effects must be included. It is true that the use of a bolt with an initial preload and, sometimes, a rivet will place the area around the hole in compression and thus tend to nullify the effects of stress concentration, but unless deﬁnite steps are taken to ensure that the preload does not relax, it is on the conservative side to design as if the full stress-concentration effect were present. The stress-concentration effects are not considered in structural design, because the loads are static and the materials ductile. In calculating the area for Eq. (8–54), the designer should, of course, use the combination of rivet or bolt holes that gives the smallest area. Figure 8–23 eillustrates a failure by crushing of the rivet or plate. Calculation of this stress, which is usually called a bearing stress, is complicated by the distribution of the load on the cylindrical surface of the rivet. The exact values of the forces act- ing upon the rivet are unknown, and so it is customary to assume that the components of these forces are uniformly distributed over the projected contact area of the rivet. This gives for the stress σ=−F A(8–55) where the projected area for a single rivet is A=td. Here, tis the thickness of the thinnest plate and dis the rivet or bolt diameter.452 Mechanical Engineering Design (a) (e)( f)( g)(b)( c)( d)Figure 8–23 Modes of failure in shear loading of a bolted or riveted connection: ( a) shear loading; (b) bending of rivet; ( c) shear of rivet; ( d) tensile failure of members; ( e) bearing of rivet on members or bearing of members on rivet; ( f) shear tear-out; ( g) tensile tear-out.bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Edge shearing, or tearing, of the margin is shown in Fig. 8–23 fandg, respec- tively. In structural practice this failure is avoided by spacing the rivets at least 11 2 diameters away from the edge. Bolted connections usually are spaced an even greater distance than this for satisfactory appearance, and hence this type of failure may usu- ally be neglected. In a rivet joint, the rivets all share the load in shear, bearing in the rivet, bearing in the member, and shear in the rivet. Other failures are participated in by only some of the joint. In a bolted joint, shear is taken by clamping friction, and bearing does not exist. When bolt preload is lost, one bolt begins to carry the shear and bearing until yielding slowly brings other fasteners in to share the shear and bearing. Finally, all participate, and this is the basis of most bolted-joint analysis if loss of bolt pre- load is complete. The usual analysis involves •Bearing in the bolt (all bolts participate) •Bearing in members (all holes participate) •Shear of bolt (all bolts participate eventually) •Distinguishing between thread and shank shear •Edge shearing and tearing of member (edge bolts participate) •Tensile yielding of member across bolt holes •Checking member capacityScrews, Fasteners, and the Design of Nonpermanent Joints 453 EXAMPLE 8–6 Two 1- by 4-in 1018 cold-rolled steel bars are butt-spliced with two 1 2- by 4-in 1018 cold-rolled splice plates using four 3 4in-16 UNF grade 5 bolts as depicted in Fig. 8–24.

Shear Joints with Eccentric Loading In the previous example, the load distributed equally to the bolts since the load acted along a line of symmetry of the fasteners. The analysis of a shear joint undergoing eccentric loading requires locating the center of relative motion between the two mem- bers. In Fig. 8–26 let A1to A5be the respective cross-sectional areas of a group of ﬁve pins, or hot-driven rivets, or tight-ﬁtting shoulder bolts. Under this assumption the rotational pivot point lies at the centroid of the cross-sectional area pattern of the pins, rivets, or bolts. Using statics, we learn that the centroid Gis located by the coordi- nates ¯xand ¯y, where x1and yiare the distances to the ith area center: ¯x=A1x1+A2x2+A3x3+A4x4+A5x5 A1+A2+A3+A4+A5=/summationtextn 1Aixi/summationtextn 1Ai ¯y=A1y1+A2y2+A3y3+A4y4+A5y5 A1+A2+A3+A4+A5=/summationtextn 1Aiyi/summationtextn 1Ai(8–56) y y_ xx _OG A1A2 A4A3 A5Figure 8–26 Centroid of pins, rivets, or bolts.bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:456 Mechanical Engineering Design In many instances the centroid can be located by symmetry. An example of eccentric loading of fasteners is shown in Fig. 8–27. This is a portion of a machine frame containing a beam subjected to the action of a bending load. In this case, the beam is fastened to vertical members at the ends with spe- cially prepared load-sharing bolts. You will recognize the schematic representation in Fig. 8–27 bas a statically indeterminate beam with both ends ﬁxed and with moment and shear reactions at each end. For convenience, the centers of the bolts at the left end of the beam are drawn to a larger scale in Fig. 8–27 c. Point Orepresents the centroid of the group, and it is assumed in this example that all the bolts are of the same diameter. Note that the forces shown in Fig. 8–27 care the resultant forces acting on the pins with a net force and moment equal and opposite to the reaction loads V1and M1acting at O. The total load taken by each bolt will be calculated in three steps. In the ﬁrst step the shear V1is divided equally among the bolts so that each bolt takes F/prime=V1/n, where nrefers to the number of bolts in the group and the force F/primeis called the direct load, or primary shear . It is noted that an equal distribution of the direct load to the bolts assumes an absolutely rigid member. The arrangement of the bolts or the shape and size of the members sometimes justiﬁes the use of another assumption as to the division of the load. The direct loads F/prime nare shown as vectors on the loading diagram (Fig. 8–27 c). The moment load, or secondary shear, is the additional load on each bolt due to the moment M1. If rA, rB, rC, etc., are the radial distances from the centroid to the center of each bolt, the moment and moment loads are related as follows: M1=F/prime/prime ArA+F/prime/prime BrB+F/prime/prime CrC+··· (a) where the F/prime/primeare the moment loads. The force taken by each bolt depends upon its radial distance from the centroid; that is, the bolt farthest from the centroid takes the greatest load, while the nearest bolt takes the smallest. We can therefore write F/prime/prime A rA=F/prime/prime B rB=F/prime/prime C rC(b)w lbf⁄in (a) (c)(b) F' F"F"F' F"F' F' F"rB rDB A D COO BeamV1 V2M2 M1w lbf⁄in O rA rCA BB A C CD D+Figure 8–27 (a) Beam bolted at both ends with distributed load; ( b) free- body diagram of beam; (c) enlarged view of bolt group centered at Oshowing primary and secondary resultant shear forces.bud29281_ch08_409-474.qxd 12/16/2009 7:11 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Screws, Fasteners, and the Design of Nonpermanent Joints 457 where again, the diameters of the bolts are assumed equal. If not, then one replaces F/prime/primein Eq. ( b) with the shear stresses τ/prime/prime=4F/prime/prime/πd2for each bolt. Solving Eqs. ( a) and ( b) simultaneously, we obtain F/prime/prime n=M1rn r2 A+r2 B+r2 C+···(8–57) where the subscript nrefers to the particular bolt whose load is to be found. These moment loads are also shown as vectors on the loading diagram. In the third step the direct and moment loads are added vectorially to obtain the resultant load on each bolt. Since all the bolts or rivets are usually the same size, only that bolt having the maximum load need be considered. When the maximum load is found, the strength may be determined by using the various methods already described.

The magnitudes are found by measurement (or analysis) to be Answer FA=FB=21.0k N Answer FC=FD=14.8k N (b) Bolts Aand Bare critical because they carry the largest shear load. Does this shear act on the threaded portion of the bolt, or on the unthreaded portion? The bolt length will be 25 mm plus the height of the nut plus about 2 mm for a washer. Table A–31 gives the nut height as 14.8 mm. Including two threads beyond the nut, this adds up to a length of 43.8 mm, and so a bolt 46 mm long will be needed. From Eq. (8–14) we compute the thread length as LT=38mm. Thus the unthreaded portion of the bolt is46−38=8mm long. This is less than the 15 mm for the plate in Fig. 8–28, and so the bolt will tend to shear across its minor diameter.

(b) View the largest load as the intensity F/prime b,maxmultiplied by the arc length associated with each bolt and ﬁnd the largest bolt load. (c) Express the load on any bolt as F=Fmaxsinθ, sum the moments due to all the bolts, and estimate the largest bolt load. Compare the results of these three approaches to decide how to attack such problems in the future.Originating Problem Problem Number Number 8–41 8–33 8–42 8–34 8–43 8–35 8–44 8–36 8–46 The ﬁgure shows a cast-iron bearing block that is to be bolted to a steel ceiling joist and is to support a gravity load of 18 kN.

For many situations, such an assumption may lead to an unsafe design. Consider the yoke bracket of Prob. 8–61, for example. Suppose this bracket is bolted to a wide-ﬂange column with the centerline through the two bolts in the ver- tical direction. A vertical load through the yoke-pin hole at distance Bfrom the column ﬂange would place a shear load on the bolts as well as a tensile load. The tensile load comes about because the bracket tends to pry itself about the bottom corner, much like a claw hammer, exert- ing a large tensile load on the upper bolt. In addition, it is almost certain that both the spac- ing of the bolt holes and their diameters will be slightly different on the column ﬂange from what they are on the yoke bracket. Thus, unless yielding occurs, only one of the bolts will take the shear load. The designer has no way of knowing which bolt this will be. In this problem the bracket is 8 in long, A=1 2in, B=3in, C=6in, and the col- umn flange is 1 2in thick. The bolts are 1 2-in UNC SAE grade 4. The nuts are tightened to 75 percent of proof load. The vertical yoke-pin load is 2500 lbf. If the upper bolt takes all the shear load as well as the tensile load, how closely does the bolt stress approach the proof strength? 8–73 The bearing of Prob. 8–46 is bolted to a vertical surface and supports a horizontal shaft. The bolts used have coarse threads and are M20 ISO 5.8. The joint constant is C=0.25, and the dimensions are A=20mm, B=50mm, and C=160mm. The bearing base is 240 mm long. The bearing load is 14 kN. If the bolts are tightened to 75 percent of proof load, will the bolt stress exceed the proof strength? Use worst-case loading, as discussed in Prob. 8–72. 8–74 A split-ring clamp-type shaft collar such as is described in Prob. 5–67 must resist an axial load of 1000 lbf.

What wrench torque should be used if a lubricated screw is used? 8–75 A vertical channel 152 ×76 (see Table A–7) has a cantilever beam bolted to it as shown.

Whenever parts have to be assembled or fabricated, there is usu- ally good cause for considering one of these processes in preliminary design work. Particularly when sections to be joined are thin, one of these methods may lead to sig- niﬁcant savings. The elimination of individual fasteners, with their holes and assembly costs, is an important factor. Also, some of the methods allow rapid machine assembly, furthering their attractiveness. Riveted permanent joints were common as the means of fastening rolled steel shapes to one another to form a permanent joint. The childhood fascination of seeing a cherry-red hot rivet thrown with tongs across a building skeleton to be unerringly caught by a person with a conical bucket, to be hammered pneumatically into its ﬁnal shape, is all but gone. Two developments relegated riveting to lesser prominence. The ﬁrst was the development of high-strength steel bolts whose preload could be controlled. The second was the improvement of welding, competing both in cost and in latitude of possible form. 9–1 Welding Symbols A weldment is fabricated by welding together a collection of metal shapes, cut to par- ticular conﬁgurations. During welding, the several parts are held securely together, often by clamping or jigging. The welds must be precisely speciﬁed on working drawings, and this is done by using the welding symbol, shown in Fig. 9–1, as stan- dardized by the American Welding Society (AWS). The arrow of this symbol points to the joint to be welded. The body of the symbol contains as many of the following ele- ments as are deemed necessary: •Reference line •Arrow F A R S L – P (N)T Field weld symbol Weld all around symbol Number of spot or projection weldsGroove angle; included angle of countersink for plug welds Length of weld Pitch (center-to-center spacing) of welds Arrow connecting reference line to arrow side of joint, to grooved member, or both Basic weld symbol or detail referenceTail (may be omitted when reference is not used)Specification; process; or other referenceFinish symbol Contour symbol Root opening; depth of filling for plug and slot welds Size; size or strength for resistance welds Reference line (Both sides) Arrow sideOther sideFigure 9–1 The AWS standard welding symbol showing the location of the symbol elements.bud29281_ch09_475-516.qxd 12/16/2009 7:12 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Welding, Bonding, and the Design of Permanent Joints 477 Type of weld Bead FilletPlug or slot Square V Bevel U JGrooveFigure 9–2 Arc- and gas-weld symbols.•Basic weld symbols as in Fig. 9–2 •Dimensions and other data •Supplementary symbols •Finish symbols •Tail •Speciﬁcation or process The arrow side of a joint is the line, side, area, or near member to which the arrow points. The side opposite the arrow side is the other side . Figures 9–3 to 9–6 illustrate the types of welds used most frequently by designers. For general machine elements most welds are ﬁllet welds, though butt welds are used a great deal in designing pressure vessels. Of course, the parts to be joined must be arranged so that there is sufﬁcient clearance for the welding operation. If unusual joints are required because of insufﬁcient clearance or because of the section shape, the design may be a poor one and the designer should begin again and endeavor to synthe- size another solution. Since heat is used in the welding operation, there are metallurgical changes in the parent metal in the vicinity of the weld. Also, residual stresses may be introduced because of clamping or holding or, sometimes, because of the order of welding. Usually these (b) (a)5 60–20060 200 Figure 9–3 Fillet welds.

When the parts to be welded are thick, a preheating will also be of beneﬁt. If the reliability of the component is to be quite high, a testing program should be established to learn what changes or additions to the operations are necessary to ensure the best quality. 9–2 Butt and Fillet Welds Figure 9–7 ashows a single V-groove weld loaded by the tensile force F.

The corresponding values of τand σare τ=1.196F/(hl)and σ=0.623F/(hl). The maximum shear stress can be found by differentiating Eq. ( d) with respect to θand equating to zero. The stationary point occurs at θ=67.5◦with a corresponding τmax=1.207F/(hl)and σ=0.5F/(hl). There are some experimental and analytical results that are helpful in evaluating Eqs. ( d) through ( f) and consequences. A model of the transverse ﬁllet weld of Fig. 9–8 is easily constructed for photoelastic purposes and has the advantage of a balanced loading condition. Norris constructed such a model and reported the stress distribution along the sides ABand BCof the weld.1An approximate graph of the results he obtained is shown as Fig. 9–10 a. Note that stress concentration exists at Aand Bon the horizontal leg and at Bon the vertical leg. Norris states that he could not determine the stresses at Aand Bwith any certainty. Salakian2presents data for the stress distribution across the throat of a ﬁllet weld (Fig. 9–10 b). This graph is of particular interest because we have just learned that it is the throat stresses that are used in design. Again, the ﬁgure shows stress concentration at point B. Note that Fig. 9–10 aapplies either to the weld metal or to the parent metal, and that Fig. 9–10 bapplies only to the weld metal. Equations ( a) through ( f) and their consequences seem familiar, and we can become comfortable with them. The net result of photoelastic and ﬁnite element analysis of trans- verse ﬁllet weld geometry is more like that shown in Fig. 9–10 than those given by mechanics of materials or elasticity methods. The most important concept here is that we have no analytical approach that predicts the existing stresses . The geometry of the ﬁllet is crude by machinery standards, and even if it were ideal, the macrogeometry is too abrupt and complex for our methods. There are also subtle bending stresses due to eccentricities. Still, in the absence of robust analysis, weldments must be speciﬁed and the resulting joints must be safe. The approach has been to use a simple and conservative model, veriﬁed by testing as conservative. The approach has been to •Consider the external loading to be carried by shear forces on the throat area of the weld. By ignoring the normal stress on the throat, the shearing stresses are inﬂated sufﬁciently to render the model conservative.bud29281_ch09_475-516.qxd 12/16/2009 7:12 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Welding, Bonding, and the Design of Permanent Joints 481 + + −ABDC /H9270/H9270 /H9268 (a)( b)+ 0DB/H92681 /H92682 /H9268/H9270maxFigure 9–10 Stress distribution in ﬁllet welds: ( a) stress distribution on the legs as reported by Norris; (b) distribution of principal stresses and maximum shear stress as reported by Salakian. l 2FF FhFigure 9–11 Parallel ﬁllet welds. •Use distortion energy for signiﬁcant stresses. •Circumscribe typical cases by code. For this model, the basis for weld analysis or design employs τ=F 0.707hl=1.414F hl(9–3) which assumes the entire force Fis accounted for by a shear stress in the minimum throat area. Note that this inﬂates the maximum estimated shear stress by a factor of 1.414/1.207=1.17. Further, consider the parallel ﬁllet welds shown in Fig. 9–11 where, as in Fig. 9–8, each weld transmits a force F. However, in the case of Fig. 9–11, the maximum shear stress isat the minimum throat area and corresponds to Eq. (9–3). Under circumstances of combined loading we •Examine primary shear stresses due to external forces. •Examine secondary shear stresses due to torsional and bending moments. •Estimate the strength(s) of the parent metal(s). •Estimate the strength of deposited weld metal. •Estimate permissible load(s) for parent metal(s). •Estimate permissible load for deposited weld metal.bud29281_ch09_475-516.qxd 12/16/2009 7:12 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:482 Mechanical Engineering Design 9–3 Stresses in Welded Joints in Torsion Figure 9–12 illustrates a cantilever of length lwelded to a column by two ﬁllet welds. The reaction at the support of a cantilever always consists of a shear force Vand a moment M. The shear force produces a primary shear in the welds of magnitude τ/prime=V A(9–4) where Ais the throat area of all the welds. The moment at the support produces secondary shear or torsion of the welds, and this stress is given by the equation τ/prime/prime=Mr J(9–5) where ris the distance from the centroid of the weld group to the point in the weld of interest and Jis the second polar moment of area of the weld group about the centroid of the group. When the sizes of the welds are known, these equations can be solved and the results combined to obtain the maximum shear stress. Note that ris usually the farthest distance from the centroid of the weld group. Figure 9–13 shows two welds in a group. The rectangles represent the throat areas of the welds. Weld 1 has a throat thickness t1=0.707h1, and weld 2 has a throat thick- ness t2=0.707h2. Note that h1and h2are the respective weld sizes. The throat area of both welds together is A=A1+A2=t1d+t2b (a) This is the area that is to be used in Eq. (9–4). The xaxis in Fig. 9–13 passes through the centroid G1of weld 1. The second moment of area about this axis is Ix=t1d3 12 Similarly, the second moment of area about an axis through G1parallel to the yaxis is Iy=dt3 1 12 F lOrorO′ /H9270′/H9270′′ /H9270Figure 9–12 This is a moment connection; such a connection produces torsion in the welds.

(9–5). The distance rmust be measured from G and the moment Mcomputed about G. The reverse procedure is that in which the allowable shear stress is given and we wish to ﬁnd the weld size. The usual procedure is to estimate a probable weld size and then to use iteration. Observe in Eqs. ( b) and ( c) the quantities t3 1and t3 2, respectively, which are the cubes of the weld thicknesses. These quantities are small and can be neglected. This leaves the terms t1d3/12and t2b3/12, which make JG1and JG2linear in the weld width. Setting the weld thicknesses t1and t2 to unity leads to the idea of treating each ﬁllet weld as a line. The resulting second moment of area is then a unit second polar moment of area . The advantage of treating the weld size as a line is that the value of Juis the same regardless of the weld size. Since the throat width of a ﬁllet weld is 0.707h, the relationship between Jand the unit value is J=0.707hJu (9–6)bud29281_ch09_475-516.qxd 12/16/2009 7:12 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:484 Mechanical Engineering Design in which Juis found by conventional methods for an area having unit width.

The shear force produces a primary shear in the welds of magnitude τ/prime=V A(a) where Ais the total throat area. The moment Minduces a horizontal shear stress component in the welds. Treating the two welds of Fig. 9–17 bas lines we ﬁnd the unit second moment of area to be Iu=bd2 2(b) The second moment of area I, based on weld throat area, is I=0.707hIu=0.707hbd2 2(c) The nominal throat shear stress is now found to be τ/prime/prime=Mc I=Md/2 0.707hbd2/2=1.414M bdh(d) The model gives the coefﬁcient of 1.414, in contrast to the predictions of Sec. 9–2 of 1.197 from distortion energy, or 1.207 from maximum shear. The conservatism of the model’s 1.414 is not that it is simply larger than either 1.196 or 1.207, but the tests carried out to validate the model show that it is large enough. The second moment of area in Eq. ( d) is based on the distance dbetween the two welds. If this moment is found by treating the two welds as having rectangular foot- prints, the distance between the weld throat centroids is approximately (d+h). This would produce a slightly larger second moment of area, and result in a smaller level of stress. This method of treating welds as a line does not interfere with the conser- vatism of the model. It also makes Table 9–2 possible with all the conveniences that ensue. The vertical (primary) shear of Eq. ( a) and the horizontal (secondary) shear of Eq.

The properties of electrodes vary considerably, but Table 9–3 lists the minimum properties for some electrode classes. It is preferable, in designing welded components, to select a steel that will result in a fast, economical weld even though this may require a sacriﬁce of other qualities such as machinability. Under the proper conditions, all steels can be welded, but best results will be obtained if steels having a UNS speciﬁcation between G10140 and G10230 are chosen. All these steels have a tensile strength in the hot-rolled condition in the range of 60 to 70 kpsi. The designer can choose factors of safety or permissible working stresses with more conﬁdence if he or she is aware of the values of those used by others. One of the best stan- dards to use is the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) code for building construction.4The permissible stresses are now based on the yield strength of the mate- rial instead of the ultimate strength, and the code permits the use of a variety of ASTM structural steels having yield strengths varying from 33 to 50 kpsi. Provided the loading is the same, the code permits the same stress in the weld metal as in the parent metal. For these ASTM steels, Sy=0.5Su. Table 9–4 lists the formulas speciﬁed by the code for calculating these permissible stresses for various loading conditions. The factors of safety implied by this code are easily calculated. For tension, n=1/0.60=1.67. For shear, n=0.577/0.40=1.44, using the distortion-energy theory as the criterion of failure. It is important to observe that the electrode material is often the strongest material present. If a bar of AISI 1010 steel is welded to one of 1018 steel, the weld metal is actually a mixture of the electrode material and the 1010 and 1018 steels.

Finally, remembering that the weld metal is usu- ally the strongest, do check the stresses in the parent metals. The AISC code, as well as the AWS code, for bridges includes permissible stresses when fatigue loading is present. The designer will have no difﬁculty in using these codes, but their empirical nature tends to obscure the fact that they have been estab- lished by means of the same knowledge of fatigue failure already discussed in Chap. 6. Of course, for structures covered by these codes, the actual stresses cannot exceed the permissible stresses; otherwise the designer is legally liable. But in general, codes tend to conceal the actual margin of safety involved. The fatigue stress-concentration factors listed in Table 9–5 are suggested for use. These factors should be used for the parent metal as well as for the weld metal. Table 9–6 gives steady-load information and minimum ﬁllet sizes.

E. Shigley and C. R. Mischke, Mechanical Engineering Design, 6th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 2001, Sec. 9–11. This section was prepared with the assistance of Professor David A. Dillard, Professor of Engineering Science and Mechanics and Director of the Center for Adhesive and Sealant Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia, and with the encouragement and technical support of the Bonding Systems Division of 3M, Saint Paul, Minnesota.9–8 Resistance Welding The heating and consequent welding that occur when an electric current is passed through several parts that are pressed together is called resistance welding . Spot weld- ingand seam welding are forms of resistance welding most often used. The advantages of resistance welding over other forms are the speed, the accurate regulation of time and heat, the uniformity of the weld, and the mechanical properties that result. In addition the process is easy to automate, and ﬁller metal and ﬂuxes are not needed. The spot- and seam-welding processes are illustrated schematically in Fig. 9–23. Seam welding is actually a series of overlapping spot welds, since the current is applied in pulses as the work moves between the rotating electrodes. Failure of a resistance weld occurs either by shearing of the weld or by tearing of the metal around the weld. Because of the possibility of tearing, it is good practice to avoid loading a resistance-welded joint in tension. Thus, for the most part, design so that the spot or seam is loaded in pure shear. The shear stress is then simply the load divided by the area of the spot. Because the thinner sheet of the pair being welded may tear, the strength of spot welds is often speciﬁed by stating the load per spot based on the thickness of the thinnest sheet. Such strengths are best obtained by experiment. Somewhat larger factors of safety should be used when parts are fastened by spot welding rather than by bolts or rivets, to account for the metallurgical changes in the materials due to the welding. 9–9 Adhesive Bonding5 The use of polymeric adhesives to join components for structural, semistructural, and non- structural applications has expanded greatly in recent years as a result of the unique advan- tages adhesives may offer for certain assembly processes and the development of new adhesives with improved robustness and environmental acceptability. The increasing complexity of modern assembled structures and the diverse types of materials used have led to many joining applications that would not be possible with more conventional join- ing techniques. Adhesives are also being used either in conjunction with or to replacebud29281_ch09_475-516.qxd 12/16/2009 7:13 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Welding, Bonding, and the Design of Permanent Joints 499 6From E. M. Petrie, Handbook of Adhesives and Sealants, 2nd ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 2007.mechanical f asteners and welds. Reduced weight, sealing capabilities, and reduced part count and assembly time, as well as improved fatigue and corrosion resistance, all combine to provide the designer with opportunities for customized assembly. The worldwide size of the adhesive and sealant industry is approximately 40 billion Euro dollars, and the United States market is about 12 billion US dollars.6At the current exchange rates, the global market is therefore approximately $57 billon. Figure 9–24 illustrates the numerous places where adhesives are used on a modern automobile. Indeed, the fabrication of many modern vehicles, devices, and structures is dependent on adhesives. In well-designed joints and with proper processing procedures, use of adhesives can result in signiﬁcant reductions in weight. Eliminating mechanical fasteners eliminates the weight of the fasteners, and also may permit the use of thinner-gauge materials because stress concentrations associated with the holes are eliminated. The capability of polymeric adhesives to dissipate energy can signiﬁcantly reduce noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH), crucial in modern automobile performance. Adhesives can be used to assemble heat-sensitive materials or components that might be damaged by drilling holes for mechanical fasteners. They can be used to join dissimilar materials or thin-gauge stock that cannot be joined through other means. Types of Adhesive There are numerous adhesive types for various applications. They may be classiﬁed in a variety of ways depending on their chemistry (e.g., epoxies, polyurethanes, poly- imides), their form (e.g., paste, liquid, ﬁlm, pellets, tape), their type (e.g., hot melt, reactive hot melt, thermosetting, pressure sensitive, contact), or their load-carrying capability (structural, semistructural, or nonstructural). Structural adhesives are relatively strong adhesives that are normally used well below their glass transition temperature; common examples include epoxies and certain acrylics. Such adhesives can carry signiﬁcant stresses, and they lend themselves to struc- tural applications. For many engineering applications, semistructural applications (where104 1391221 815 8 21 9 36 13 1 1511 147Exterior Trim Sound InsulationBrake/ TransmissionWheel HousingBody-in-WhiteInterior Trim Bumper AssemblyEngine CompartmentHem FlangeWindshield/ Windows Exterior Body Panels Light AssembliesAntiflutter Panel ReinforcementsPaint Shop 4 10 10 Figure 9–24 Diagram of an automobile body showing at least 15 locations at which adhesives and sealants could be used or are being used. Particular note should be made of the windshield (8), which is considered a load-bearing structure in modern automobiles and is adhesively bonded. Also attention should be paid to hem ﬂange bonding (1), in which adhesives are used to bond and seal. Adhesives are used to bond friction surfaces in brakes and clutches (10). Antiﬂutter adhesive bonding (2) helps control deformation of hood and trunk lids under wind shear. Thread-sealing adhesives are used in engine applications (12). (From A. V .

These include contact adhesives, where a solution or emulsion containing an elastomeric adhesive is coated onto both adherends, the solvent is allowed to evaporate, and then the two adherends are brought into contact. Examples include rubber cement and adhesives used to bond lami- nates to countertops. Pressure-sensitive adhesives are very low modulus elastomers that deform easily under small pressures, permitting them to wet surfaces. When the substrate and adhesive are brought into intimate contact, van der Waals forces are sufﬁcient to main- tain the contact and provide relatively durable bonds. Pressure-sensitive adhesives are nor- mally purchased as tapes or labels for nonstructural applications, although there are also double-sided foam tapes that can be used in semistructural applications. As the name implies, hot melts become liquid when heated, wetting the surfaces and then cooling into a solid polymer. These materials are increasingly applied in a wide array of engineering applications by more sophisticated versions of the glue guns in popular use. Anaerobic adhesives cure within narrow spaces deprived of oxygen; such materials have been widely used in mechanical engineering applications to lock bolts or bearings in place. Cure in other adhesives may be induced by exposure to ultraviolet light or electron beams, or it may be catalyzed by certain materials that are ubiquitous on many surfaces, such as water.

Bonds are typically much stronger when loaded in shear rather than in tension across the bond plate. Lap-shear joints represent an important family of joints, both for test specimens to evaluate adhesive properties and for actual incorporation into practical designs. Generic types of lap joints that commonly arise are illustrated in Fig. 9–25. The simplest analysis of lap joints suggests the applied load is uniformly dis- tributed over the bond area. Lap joint test results, such as those obtained following the ASTM D1002 for single-lap joints, report the “apparent shear strength” as the breaking load divided by the bond area. Although this simple analysis can be ade- quate for stiff adherends bonded with a soft adhesive over a relatively short bond length, significant peaks in shear stress occur except for the most flexible adhesives. In an effort to point out the problems associated with such practice, ASTM D4896 outlines some of the concerns associated with taking this simplistic view of stresses within lap joints. In 1938, O. V olkersen presented an analysis of the lap joint, known as the shear- lag model . It provides valuable insights into the shear-stress distributions in a host of lap joints. Bending induced in the single-lap joint due to eccentricity signiﬁcantly complicates the analysis, so here we will consider a symmetric double-lap joint to(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (g) (h)(f)Figure 9–25 Common types of lap joints used in mechanical design: (a) single lap; ( b) double lap; (c) scarf; ( d) bevel; ( e) step; (f) butt strap; ( g) double butt strap; ( h) tubular lap.

The large stresses present for the combined-load case could result in local yielding of a ductile adhesive or failure of a more brittle one. The signiﬁcance of the thermal stresses serves as a caution against joining dissimilar adherends when large temperature changes are involved. Note also that the average shear stress due to the load isbud29281_ch09_475-516.qxd 12/16/2009 7:13 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:504 Mechanical Engineering Design Although design considerations for single-lap joints are beyond the scope of this chapter, one should note that the load eccentricity is an important aspect in the stress state of single-lap joints. Adherend bending can result in shear stresses that may be as much as double those given for the double-lap conﬁguration (for a given total bond area). In addition, peel stresses can be quite large and often account for joint failure. Finally, plastic bending of the adherends can lead to high strains, which less ductile adhesives cannot withstand, leading to bond failure as well. Bending stresses in the adherends at the end of the overlap can be four times greater than the average stress within the adherend; thus, they must be considered in the design. Figure 9–28 shows the shear and peel stresses present in a typical single-lap joint that corresponds to the ASTM D1002 test specimen. Note that the shear stresses are signiﬁcantly larger than predicted by the V olkersen analysis, a result of the increased adhesive strains associated with adherend bending. Joint Design Some basic guidelines that should be used in adhesive joint design include: •Design to place bondline in shear, not peel. Beware of peel stresses focused at bond terminations. When necessary, reduce peel stresses through tapering the adherend ends, increasing bond area where peel stresses occur, or utilizing rivets at bond termi- nations where peel stresses can initiate failures. •Where possible, use adhesives with adequate ductility. The ability of an adhesive to yield reduces the stress concentrations associated with the ends of joints and increases the toughness to resist debond propagation. •Recognize environmental limitations of adhesives and surface preparation methods. Exposure to water, solvents, and other diluents can signiﬁcantly degrade adhesive performance in some situations, through displacing the adhesive from the surface or degrading the polymer. Certain adhesives may be susceptible to environmental stress cracking in the presence of certain solvents. Exposure to ultraviolet light can also degrade adhesives.10002000 −2000−100030004000 0.2 0.4 −0.4Shear stress /H9270 (psi) Combined Thermal Load induced x (in) −0.2Figure 9–27 Plot for Ex. 9–7. τavg=P/(2bl)=1000 psi.

A missing rivet or bolt is often easy to detect, but debonds or unsatisfactory adhesive bonds are not readily apparent. •Allow for sufﬁcient bond area so that the joint can tolerate some debonding before going critical. This increases the likelihood that debonds can be detected. Having some regions of the overall bond at relatively low stress levels can signiﬁcantly improve durability and reliability. •Where possible, bond to multiple surfaces to offer support to loads in any direction. Bonding an attachment to a single surface can place peel stresses on the bond, whereas bonding to several adjacent planes tends to permit arbitrary loads to be carried pre- dominantly in shear. •Adhesives can be used in conjunction with spot welding. The process is known as weld bonding . The spot welds serve to ﬁxture the bond until it is cured.

In doing so solicit the force F, the clearance a, and the largest allowable shear stress. Then, as part of an iterative loop, solicit the dimensions band dof the rectangle. These can be your design variables. Output all the parameters after the leg size has been determined by computation. In effect this will be your adequacy assessment when you stop iterating. Include the ﬁgure of merit Ju/(hl)in the output. The fom and the leg size hwith avail- able width will give you a useful insight into the nature of this class of welds. Use your program to verify your solutions to Prob. 9–37. 9–39 Fillet welds in joints resisting bending are interesting in that they can be simpler than those resist- ing torsion. From Prob. 9–33 you learned that your objective is to place weld metal as far away from the weld-bead centroid as you can, but distributed in an orientation parallel to the x axis. Furthermore, placement on the top and bottom of the built-in end of a cantilever with rectangu- lar cross section results in parallel weld beads, each element of which is in the ideal position. The object of this problem is to study the full weld bead and the interrupted weld-bead pattern. Consider the case of Fig. 9–17, p. 487, with F=10kips, the beam length is 10 in, b=8in, and d=8in. For the second case, for the interrupted weld consider a centered gap of b1=2in exist- ing in the top and bottom welds. Study the two cases with τall=12.8kpsi. What do you notice about τ,σ, and τmax? Compare the fom/prime. 9–40 For a rectangular weld-bead track resisting bending, develop the necessary equations to treat cases of vertical welds, horizontal welds, and weld-all-around patterns with depth dand width b and allowing central gaps in parallel beads of length b1and d1. Do this by superposition of par- allel tracks, vertical tracks subtracting out the gaps. Then put the two together for a rectangular weld bead with central gaps of length b1and d1.

Either or both of these can be your design variables. Program to ﬁnd the leg size corresponding to a shear-stress level at the maximum allowable at a corner. Output all your parameters including the ﬁgure of merit. Use the program to check any previous problems to which it is applicable. Play with it in a “what if” mode and learn from the trends in your parameters. 9–42 When comparing two different weldment patterns it is useful to observe the resistance to bend- ing or torsion and the volume of weld metal deposited. Measure of effectiveness, deﬁned as sec- ond moment of area divided by weld-metal volume, is useful. If a 3-in by 6-in section of a can- tilever carries a static bending moment of 100 kip ·in in the weldment plane, with an allowable shear stress of 12 kpsi realized, compare horizontal weldments with vertical weldments.

Flexibility is sometimes needed and is often provided by metal bodies with cleverly controlled geometry. These bodies can exhibit ﬂexibility to the degree the designer seeks. Such ﬂexibility can be linear or nonlinear in relating deﬂection to load. These devices allow controlled application of force or torque; the storing and release of energy can be another purpose. Flexibility allows temporary distortion for access and the immediate restoration of function. Because of machinery’s value to designers, springs have been intensively studied; moreover, they are mass-produced (and therefore low cost), and ingenious conﬁgura- tions have been found for a variety of desired applications. In this chapter we will discuss the more frequently used types of springs, their necessary parametric rela- tionships, and their design. In general, springs may be classiﬁed as wire springs, ﬂat springs, or special- shaped springs, and there are variations within these divisions. Wire springs include helical springs of round or square wire, made to resist and deﬂect under tensile, com- pressive, or torsional loads. Flat springs include cantilever and elliptical types, wound motor- or clock-type power springs, and ﬂat spring washers, usually called Belleville springs. 10–1 Stresses in Helical Springs Figure 10–1 ashows a round-wire helical compression spring loaded by the axial force F. We designate Das the mean coil diameter anddas the wire diameter . Now imagine that the spring is cut at some point (Fig. 10–1 b), a portion of it removed, and the effect of the removed portion replaced by the net internal reactions. Then, as shown in the ﬁgure, from equilibrium the cut portion would contain a direct shear force Fand a tor- sion T=FD/2. The maximum stress in the wire may be computed by superposition of the direct shear stress given by Eq. (3–23), p. 89, with V=Fand the torsional shear stress given by Eq. (3–37), p. 101. The result is τmax=Tr J+F A(a) dF F FFT = FD/H208622 D (a)(b)Figure 10–1 (a) Axially loaded helical spring; ( b) free-body diagram showing that the wire is subjected to a direct shear and a torsional shear.bud29281_ch10_517-568.qxd 12/16/2009 7:14 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Mechanical Springs 519 2Cyril Samónov, “Some Aspects of Design of Helical Compression Springs,” Int.

Substitution of τmax=τ, T=FD/2, r=d/2, J= πd4/32, and A=πd2/4gives τ=8FD πd3+4F πd2(b) Now we deﬁne the spring index C=D d(10–1) which is a measure of coil curvature. The preferred value of Cranges from 4 to 12.1 With this relation, Eq. ( b) can be rearranged to give τ=Ks8FD πd3(10–2) where Ksis a shear stress -correction factor and is deﬁned by the equation Ks=2C+1 2C(10–3) The use of square or rectangular wire is not recommended for springs unless space limitations make it necessary. Springs of special wire shapes are not made in large quantities, unlike those of round wire; they have not had the beneﬁt of reﬁning development and hence may not be as strong as springs made from round wire. When space is severely limited, the use of nested round-wire springs should always be con- sidered. They may have an economical advantage over the special-section springs, as well as a strength advantage. 10–2 The Curvature Effect Equation (10–2) is based on the wire being straight. However, the curvature of the wire increases the stress on the inside of the spring but decreases it only slightly on the out- side. This curvature stress is primarily important in fatigue because the loads are lower and there is no opportunity for localized yielding. For static loading, these stresses can normally be neglected because of strain-strengthening with the ﬁrst application of load. Unfortunately, it is necessary to ﬁnd the curvature factor in a roundabout way. The reason for this is that the published equations also include the effect of the direct shear stress. Suppose Ksin Eq. (10–2) is replaced by another Kfactor, which corrects for both curvature and direct shear. Then this factor is given by either of the equations KW=4C−1 4C−4+0.615 C(10–4) KB=4C+2 4C−3(10–5) The ﬁrst of these is called the Wahl factor, and the second, the Bergsträsser factor.2 Since the results of these two equations differ by the order of 1 percent, Eq. (10–6) is preferred. The curvature correction factor can now be obtained by canceling out the 1Design Handbook: Engineering Guide to Spring Design , Associated Spring-Barnes Group Inc., Bristol, CT, 1987.bud29281_ch10_517-568.qxd 12/16/2009 7:14 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:520 Mechanical Engineering Design 3For a thorough discussion and development of these relations, see Cyril Samónov, “Computer-Aided Design of Helical Compression Springs,” ASME paper No. 80-DET-69, 1980.effect of the direct shear. Thus, using Eq. (10–5) with Eq. (10–3), the curvature cor- rection factor is found to be Kc=KB Ks=2C(4C+2) (4C−3)(2C+1)(10–6) Now, Ks, KBor KW, and Kcare simply stress-correction factors applied multiplica- tively to Tr/Jat the critical location to estimate a particular stress. There is nostress- concentration factor. In this book we will use τ=KB8FD πd3(10–7) to predict the largest shear stress. 10–3 Deﬂection of Helical Springs The deﬂection-force relations are quite easily obtained by using Castigliano’s theorem. The total strain energy for a helical spring is composed of a torsional component and a shear component. From Eqs. (4–18) and (4–20), p. 162, the strain energy is U=T2l 2GJ+F2l 2AG(a) Substituting T=FD/2, l=πDN, J=πd4/32, and A=πd2/4results in U=4F2D3N d4G+2F2DN d2G(b) where N=Na=number of active coils. Then using Castigliano’s theorem, Eq. (4–26), p. 165, to ﬁnd total deﬂection ygives y=∂U ∂F=8FD3N d4G+4FDN d2G(c) Since C=D/d, Eq. ( c) can be rearranged to yield y=8FD3N d4G/parenleftbigg 1+1 2C2/parenrightbigg .=8FD3N d4G(10–8) The spring rate, also called the scale of the spring, is k=F/y, and so k.=d4G 8D3N(10–9) 10–4 Compression Springs The four types of ends generally used for compression springs are illustrated in Fig. 10–2. A spring with plain ends has a noninterrupted helicoid; the ends are the same as if a long spring had been cut into sections. A spring with plain ends that are squared or closed is obtained by deforming the ends to a zero-degree helix angle. Springs should always be both squared and ground for important applications, because a better transfer of the load is obtained. Table 10–1 shows how the type of end used affects the number of coils and the spring length.3Note that the digits 0, 1, 2, and 3 appearing in Table 10–1 are oftenbud29281_ch10_517-568.qxd 12/16/2009 7:14 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Mechanical Springs 521 (a) Plain end, right hand (c) Squared and ground end, left hand (b) Squared or closed end, right hand(d) Plain end, ground, left hand+ + + +Figure 10–2 Types of ends for compression springs: ( a) both ends plain; (b) both ends squared; ( c) both ends squared and ground; (d) both ends plain and ground.

Forys, “Accurate Spring Heights,” Machine Design, vol. 56, no. 2, January 26, 1984.used without question. Some of these need closer scrutiny as they may not be integers. This depends on how a springmaker forms the ends. Forys4pointed out that squared and ground ends give a solid length Lsof Ls=(Nt−a)d where avaries, with an average of 0.75, so the entry dN tin Table 10–1 may be over- stated. The way to check these variations is to take springs from a particular spring- maker, close them solid, and measure the solid height. Another way is to look at the spring and count the wire diameters in the solid stack. Set removal orpresetting is a process used in the manufacture of compression springs to induce useful residual stresses. It is done by making the spring longer than needed and then compressing it to its solid height. This operation setsthe spring to the required ﬁnal free length and, since the torsional yield strength has been exceeded, induces residual stresses opposite in direction to those induced in service. Springs to be preset should be designed so that 10 to 30 percent of the initial free length is removed during the operation. If the stress at the solid height is greater than 1.3 times the torsional yield strength, distortion may occur. If this stress is much less than 1.1 times, it is difﬁcult to control the resulting free length. Set removal increases the strength of the spring and so is especially useful when the spring is used for energy-storage purposes. However, set removal should not be used when springs are subject to fatigue.bud29281_ch10_517-568.qxd 12/16/2009 7:14 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:522 Mechanical Engineering Design 5Cyril Samónov “Computer-Aided Design,” op. cit. 6A.

Similarly, compression coil springs may buckle when the deﬂection becomes too large.

This depends upon how the ends of the spring are supported. Table 10–2 gives values of αfor usual end conditions. Note how closely these resemble the end conditions for columns.

In general, pre- hardened wire should not be used if D/d<4or if d>1 4in. Winding of the spring induces residual stresses through bending, but these are normal to the direction of the torsional working stresses in a coil spring. Quite frequently in spring manufacture, they are relieved, after winding, by a mild thermal treatment. A great variety of spring materials are available to the designer, including plain carbon steels, alloy steels, and corrosion-resisting steels, as well as nonferrous materi- als such as phosphor bronze, spring brass, beryllium copper, and various nickel alloys. Descriptions of the most commonly used steels will be found in Table 10–3. The UNS steels listed in Appendix A should be used in designing hot-worked, heavy-coil springs, as well as ﬂat springs, leaf springs, and torsion bars. Spring materials may be compared by an examination of their tensile strengths; these vary so much with wire size that they cannot be speciﬁed until the wire size is known. The material and its processing also, of course, have an effect on tensile strength. It turns out that the graph of tensile strength versus wire diameter is almost a straight line for some materials when plotted on log-log paper. Writing the equation of this line as Sut=A dm(10–14) furnishes a good means of estimating minimum tensile strengths when the intercept A and the slope mof the line are known. Values of these constants have been worked out from recent data and are given for strengths in units of kpsi and MPa in Table 10–4. In Eq. (10–14) when dis measured in millimeters, then Ais in MPa·mmmand when dis measured in inches, then Ais in kpsi·inm. Although the torsional yield strength is needed to design the spring and to analyze the performance, spring materials customarily are tested only for tensile strength— perhaps because it is such an easy and economical test to make. A very rough estimate of the torsional yield strength can be obtained by assuming that the tensile yield strength is between 60 and 90 percent of the tensile strength. Then the distortion-energy theory can be employed to obtain the torsional yield strength ( Sys=0.577Sy). This approach results in the range 0.35Sut≤Ssy≤0.52Sut (10–15) for steels. For wires listed in Table 10–5, the maximum allowable shear stress in a spring can be seen in column 3. Music wire and hard-drawn steel spring wire have a low end of range Ssy=0.45Sut. Valve spring wire, Cr-Va, Cr-Si, and other (not shown) hard- ened and tempered carbon and low-alloy steel wires as a group have Ssy≥0.50Sut. Many nonferrous materials (not shown) as a group have Ssy≥0.35Sut.

Do not use above 120°C (250°F) or at subzero temperatures. This general-purpose spring steel is used for many types of coil springs where the cost of music wire is prohibitive and in sizes larger than available in music wire. Not for shock or impact loading. Available in diameters 3 to 12 mm (0.125 to 0.5000 in), but larger and smaller sizes may be obtained. Not for use above 180°C (350°F) or at subzero temperatures. This is the cheapest general-purpose spring steel and should be used only where life, accuracy, and deﬂection are not too important. Available in diameters 0.8 to 12 mm (0.031 to 0.500 in). Not for use above 120°C (250°F) or at subzero temperatures. This is the most popular alloy spring steel for conditions involving higher stresses than can be used with the high-carbon steels and for use where fatigue resistance and long endurance are needed. Also good for shock and impact loads. Widely used for aircraft-engine valve springs and for temperatures to 220°C (425°F). Available in annealed or pretempered sizes 0.8 to 12 mm (0.031 to 0.500 in) in diameter. This alloy is an excellent material for highly stressed springs that require long life and are subjected to shock loading. Rockwell hardnesses of C50 to C53 are quite common, and the material may be used up to 250°C (475°F). Available from 0.8 to 12 mm (0.031 to 0.500 in) in diameter.Table 10–3 High-Carbon and Alloy Spring Steels Source: From Harold C. R.

For speciﬁc materials for which you have torsional yield information use this table as a guide. Joerres provides set-removal information in Table 10–6, that Ssy≥0.65Sutincreases strength through cold work, but at the cost of an additional operation by the springmaker. Sometimes the additional operation can be done by the manufacturer during assembly. Some correlations with carbon steel springs show that the tensile yield strength of spring wire in torsion can be estimated from 0.75Sut. The corresponding estimate of the yield strength in shear based on distortion energy theory is Ssy=0.577(0.75)Sut=0.433Sut.=0.45Sut. Samónov discusses the problem of allowable stress and shows that Ssy=τall=0.56Sut (10–16) for high-tensile spring steels, which is close to the value given by Joerres for hard- ened alloy steels. He points out that this value of allowable stress is speciﬁed by Draft Standard 2089 of the German Federal Republic when Eq. (10–2) is used without stress- correction factor. 8Robert E.

However, the forming of the ends will control how close αis to 0.5. This has to be investigated and an inside rod or exterior tube or hole may be needed. (h) Finally, from Table 10–1, the pitch of the body coil is Answer p=L0−3d Na=2.06−3(0.037) 10.5=0.186 in 10–7 Helical Compression Spring Design for Static Service The preferred range of spring index is 4≤C≤12, with the lower indexes being more difﬁcult to form (because of the danger of surface cracking) and springs with higher indexes tending to tangle often enough to require individual packing. This can be the ﬁrst item of the design assessment. The recommended range of active turns is 3≤Na≤15. To maintain linearity when a spring is about to close, it is necessary to avoid the gradual touching of coils (due to nonperfect pitch). A helical coil spring force-deﬂection charac- teristic is ideally linear. Practically, it is nearly so, but not at each end of the force-deﬂection curve. The spring force is not reproducible for very small deﬂections, and near closure, nonlinear behavior begins as the number of active turns diminishes as coils begin to touch. The designer conﬁnes the spring’s operating point to the central 75 percent of the curve between no load, F=0, and closure, F=Fs. Thus, the maximum operating force should be limited to Fmax≤7 8Fs. Deﬁning the fractional overrun to closure as ξ, where Fs=(1+ξ)Fmax (10–17) it follows that Fs=(1+ξ)Fmax=(1+ξ)/parenleftbigg7 8/parenrightbigg Fs From the outer equality ξ=1/7=0.143.=0.15. Thus, it is recommended that ξ≥0.15. In addition to the relationships and material properties for springs, we now have some recommended design conditions to follow, namely: 4≤C≤12 (10–18) 3≤Na≤15 (10–19) ξ≥0.15 (10–20) ns≥1.2 (10–21) where nsis the factor of safety at closure (solid height). When considering designing a spring for high volume production, the ﬁgure of merit can be the cost of the wire from which the spring is wound. The fom would be proportional to the relative material cost, weight density, and volume: fom=−(relative material cost )γπ2d2NtD 4(10–22) For comparisons between steels, the speciﬁc weight γcan be omitted. Spring design is an open-ended process. There are many decisions to be made, and many possible solution paths as well as solutions. In the past, charts, nomographs, and “spring design slide rules” were used by many to simplify the spring design prob- lem. Today, the computer enables the designer to create programs in many different formats—direct programming, spreadsheet, MATLAB, etc. Commercial programs arebud29281_ch10_517-568.qxd 12/16/2009 7:14 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Mechanical Springs 529 9For example, see Advanced Spring Design, a program developed jointly between the Spring Manufacturers Institute (SMI), www.smihq.org, and Universal Technical Systems, Inc. (UTS), www.uts.com.also available.9There are almost as many ways to create a spring-design program as there are programmers. Here, we will suggest one possible design approach. Design Strategy Make the a priori decisions, with hard-drawn steel wire the ﬁrst choice (relative mate- rial cost is 1.0). Choose a wire size d. With all decisions made, generate a column of parameters: d, D, C, OD or ID, Na, Ls, L0, (L0)cr, ns, and fom. By incrementing wire sizes available, we can scan the table of parameters and apply the design rec- ommendations by inspection. After wire sizes are eliminated, choose the spring design with the highest ﬁgure of merit. This will give the optimal design despite the presence of a discrete design variable dand aggregation of equality and inequality constraints. The column vector of information can be generated by using the ﬂowchart displayed in Fig. 10–3.

Had the spring been in a hole or over a rod, the helix diameter would be chosen without reference to (ns)d. The result is that there are only two springs in the feasible domain, one with a wire diameter of 0.080 in and the other with a wire diameter of 0.085. The ﬁgure of merit decides and the decision is the design with 0.080 in wire diameter. Having designed a spring, will we have it made to our speciﬁcations? Not neces- sarily. There are vendors who stock literally thousands of music wire compression springs. By browsing their catalogs, we will usually ﬁnd several that are close. Max- imum deﬂection and maximum load are listed in the display of characteristics. Check to see if this allows soliding without damage. Often it does not. Spring rates may only be close. At the very least this situation allows a small number of springs to be ordered “off the shelf” for testing. The decision often hinges on the economics of special order versus the acceptability of a close match. Spring design is not a closed-form approach and requires iteration. Example 10–2 provided an iterative approach to spring design for static service by ﬁrst selecting the wire diameter. The diameter selection can be rather arbitrary. In the next example, we will ﬁrst select a value for the spring index C, which is within the recommended range. EXAMPLE 10–3 Design a compression spring with plain ends using hard-drawn wire. The deﬂection is to be 2.25 in when the force is 18 lbf and to close solid when the force is 24 lbf. Upon closure, use a design factor of 1.2 guarding against yielding. Select the small- est gauge W&M (Washburn & Moen) wire. Solution Instead of starting with a trial wire diameter, we will start with an acceptable spring index for Cafter some preliminaries. From Eq. (10–14) and Table 10–6 the shear strength, in kpsi, is Ssy=0.45Sut=0.45/parenleftbiggA dm/parenrightbigg (1) The shear stress is given by Eq.

(5) gives d=/parenleftbigg 0.1631.135(10) 140/parenrightbigg1/(2−0.190) =0.09160 in From Table A–28, a 12-gauge W&M wire, d=0.1055 in, is selected. Checking the resulting factor of safety, from Eq.

If we had selected the 13-gauge wire, d=0.091 5 in, the factor of safety would be n=1.198,which rounds to 1.2. Taking a little liberty here we will select the W&M 13-gauge wire. To continue with the design, the spring rate is k=F y=18 2.25=8 lbf/in From Eq. (10–9) solving for the active number of coils Na=d4G 8kD3=dG 8kC3=0.091 5(11.5)106 8(8)103=16.4 turns This exceeds the recommended range of 3≤Na≤15.To decrease Na, increase C. Repeating the process with C=12gives KB=1.111and d=0.1001 in. Selecting a 12-gauge W&M wire, d=0.1055 in. From Eq. (6), this gives n=1.32, which is acceptable. The number of active coils is Na=dG 8kC3=0.105 5(11.5)106 8(8)123=10.97=11 turns which is acceptable. From Table 10–1, for plain ends, the total number of coils is Nt=Na=11turns. The deﬂection from free length to solid length of the spring is given by ys=Fmax k=24 8=3i n From Table 10–1, the solid length is Ls=d(Nt+1)=0.105 5(11+1)=1.266 inbud29281_ch10_517-568.qxd 12/16/2009 7:14 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:534 Mechanical Engineering Design The free length of the spring is then L0=Ls+ys=1.266+3=4.266 in The mean coil diameter of the spring is D=Cd=12(0.105 5)=1.266 in and the outside coil diameter of the spring is OD =D+d=1.266+0.105 5 = 1.372 in. To avoid buckling, Eq. (10–13) gives α< 2.63D L0=2.631.266 4.266=0.780 From Table 10–2, the spring is stable provided it is supported between either ﬁxed- ﬁxed or ﬁxed-hinged ends. The ﬁnal results are: Answer W&M wire size: 12 gauge, d=0.1055 in Outside coil diameter: OD =1.372in Total number of coils: Nt=11turns with plain ends Free length: L0=4.266in 10–8 Critical Frequency of Helical Springs If a wave is created by a disturbance at one end of a swimming pool, this wave will travel down the length of the pool, be reﬂected back at the far end, and continue in this back-and-forth motion until it is ﬁnally damped out. The same effect occurs in helical springs, and it is called spring surge . If one end of a compression spring is held against a ﬂat surface and the other end is disturbed, a compression wave is created that travels back and forth from one end to the other exactly like the swimming-pool wave. Spring manufacturers have taken slow-motion movies of automotive valve-spring surge. These pictures show a very violent surging, with the spring actually jumping out of contact with the end plates. Figure 10–4 is a photograph of a failure caused by such surging. When helical springs are used in applications requiring a rapid reciprocating motion, the designer must be certain that the physical dimensions of the spring are not such as to create a natural vibratory frequency close to the frequency of the applied force; otherwise, resonance may occur, resulting in damaging stresses, since the internal damping of spring materials is quite low. The governing equation for the translational vibration of a spring is the wave equation ∂2u ∂x2=W kgl2∂2u ∂t2(10–24) where k=spring rate g=acceleration due to gravity l=length of spring W=weight of spring x=coordinate along length of spring u=motion of any particle at distance xbud29281_ch10_517-568.qxd 12/16/2009 7:14 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Mechanical Springs 535 10J. C. Wolford and G. M. Smith, “Surge of Helical Springs,” Mech. Eng. News, vol. 13, no. 1, February 1976, pp. 4–9.The solution to this equation is harmonic and depends on the given physical prop- erties as well as the end conditions of the spring. The harmonic, natural, frequencies for a spring placed between two ﬂat and parallel plates, in radians per second, are ω=mπ/radicalbigg kg Wm=1,2,3,... where the fundamental frequency is found for m=1, the second harmonic for m=2, and so on. We are usually interested in the frequency in cycles per second; since ω= 2πf, we have, for the fundamental frequency in hertz, f=1 2/radicalbigg kg W(10–25) assuming the spring ends are always in contact with the plates. Wolford and Smith10show that the frequency is f=1 4/radicalbigg kg W(10–26) where the spring has one end against a ﬂat plate and the other end free. They also point out that Eq. (10–25) applies when one end is against a ﬂat plate and the other end is driven with a sine-wave motion. The weight of the active part of a helical spring is W=ALγ=πd2 4(πDN a)(γ)=π2d2DN aγ 4(10–27) where γis the speciﬁc weight. Figure 10–4 Valve-spring failure in an overrevved engine.

If the frequency is not high enough, the spring should be redesigned to increase kor decrease W. 10–9 Fatigue Loading of Helical Compression Springs Springs are almost always subject to fatigue loading. In many instances the number of cycles of required life may be small, say, several thousand for a padlock spring or a toggle-switch spring. But the valve spring of an automotive engine must sustain mil- lions of cycles of operation without failure; so it must be designed for inﬁnite life. To improve the fatigue strength of dynamically loaded springs, shot peening can be used. It can increase the torsional fatigue strength by 20 percent or more. Shot size is about 1 64in, so spring coil wire diameter and pitch must allow for complete cov- erage of the spring surface. The best data on the torsional endurance limits of spring steels are those reported by Zimmerli.11He discovered the surprising fact that size, material, and tensile strength have no effect on the endurance limits (inﬁnite life only) of spring steels in sizes under 3 8in (10 mm). We have already observed that endurance limits tend to level out at high ten- sile strengths (Fig. 6–17), p. 283, but the reason for this is not clear. Zimmerli suggests that it may be because the original surfaces are alike or because plastic ﬂow during test- ing makes them the same. Unpeened springs were tested from a minimum torsional stress of 20 kpsi to a maximum of 90 kpsi and peened springs in the range 20 kpsi to 135 kpsi. The corresponding endurance strength components for inﬁnite life were found to be Unpeened: Ssa=35 kpsi (241 MPa ) Ssm=55 kpsi (379 MPa ) (10–28) Peened: Ssa=57.5 kpsi (398 MPa ) Ssm=77.5 kpsi (534 MPa ) (10–29) For example, given an unpeened spring with Ssu=211.5kpsi, the Gerber ordinate inter- cept for shear, from Eq. (6–42), p. 306, is Sse=Ssa 1−/parenleftbiggSsm Ssu/parenrightbigg2=35 1−/parenleftbigg55 211.5/parenrightbigg2=37.5 kpsi For the Goodman failure criterion, the intercept would be 47.3 kpsi. Each possible wire size would change these numbers, since Ssuwould change. An extended study12of available literature regarding torsional fatigue found that for polished, notch-free, cylindrical specimens subjected to torsional shear stress, the maximum alternating stress that may be imposed without causing failure is constant and independent of the mean stress in the cycle provided that the maximum stress range does not equal or exceed the torsional yield strength of the metal. With notches and abrupt section changes this consistency is not found. Springs are free of notches and surfaces are often very smooth. This failure criterion is known as the Sines failure criterion in torsional fatigue. 11F. P.

We shall continue to employ Eq. (6–54), p. 317, which is Ssu=0.67Sut (10–30) In the case of shafts and many other machine members, fatigue loading in the form of completely reversed stresses is quite ordinary. Helical springs, on the other hand, are never used as both compression and extension springs. In fact, they are usually assembled with a preload so that the working load is additional. Thus the stress-time diagram of Fig. 6–23 d, p. 301, expresses the usual condition for helical springs. The worst condition, then, would occur when there is no preload, that is, when τmin=0. Now, we deﬁne Fa=Fmax−Fmin 2(10–31 a) Fm=Fmax+Fmin 2(10–31 b) where the subscripts have the same meaning as those of Fig. 6–23 dwhen applied to the axial spring force F. Then the shear stress amplitude is τa=KB8FaD πd3(10–32) where KBis the Bergsträsser factor, obtained from Eq. (10–5), and corrects for both direct shear and the curvature effect. As noted in Sec. 10–2, the Wahl factor KWcan be used instead, if desired. The midrange shear stress is given by the equation τm=KB8FmD πd3(10–33) EXAMPLE 10–4 An as-wound helical compression spring, made of music wire, has a wire size of 0.092 in, an outside coil diameter of 9 16in, a free length of 43 8in, 21 active coils, and both ends squared and ground. The spring is unpeened. This spring is to be assembled with a preload of 5 lbf and will operate with a maximum load of 35 lbf during use.

We used three approaches to estimate the fatigue factor of safety in Ex. 10–4. The results, in order of smallest to largest, were 1.18 (Sines), 1.21 (Gerber), and 1.23 (Goodman). Although the results were very close to one another, using the Zimmerli data as we have, the Sines criterion will always be the most conservative and the Goodman the least. If we perform a fatigue analysis using strength properties as was done in Chap. 6, different results would be obtained, but here the Goodman criterion would be more conservative than the Gerber criterion. Be prepared to see designers or design software using any one of these techniques. This is why we cover them. Which criterion is correct? Remember, we are performing estimates and only testing will reveal the truth— statistically . 10–10 Helical Compression Spring Design for Fatigue Loading Let us begin with the statement of a problem. In order to compare a static spring to a dynamic spring, we shall design the spring in Ex. 10–2 for dynamic service. EXAMPLE 10–5 A music wire helical compression spring with infinite life is needed to resist a dynamic load that varies from 5 to 20 lbf at 5 Hz while the end deﬂection varies from 1 2to 2 in. Because of assembly considerations, the solid height cannot exceed 1 in and the free length cannot be more than 4 in. The springmaker has the following wire sizes in stock: 0.069, 0.071, 0.080, 0.085, 0.090, 0.095, 0.105, and 0.112 in.bud29281_ch10_517-568.qxd 12/16/2009 7:14 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:540 Mechanical Engineering Design Solution The a priori decisions are: •Material and condition: for music wire, A=201 kpsi ·inm, m=0.145, G= 11.75(106)psi; relative cost is 2.6 •Surface treatment: unpeened •End treatment: squared and ground •Robust linearity: ξ=0.15 •Set: use in as-wound condition •Fatigue-safe: nf=1.5using the Sines-Zimmerli fatigue-failure criterion •Function: Fmin=5lbf,Fmax=20lbf,ymin=0.5in,ymax=2in, spring operates free (no rod or hole) •Decision variable: wire size d The ﬁgure of merit will be the volume of wire to wind the spring, Eq.

Repeat the process using the other available wire sizes and develop the following table: The problem-speciﬁc inequality constraints are Ls≤1i n L0≤4i n fn≥5(20)=100 Hz The general constraints are 3≤Na≤15 4≤C≤12 (L0)cr>L0 We see that none of the diameters satisfy the given constraints. The 0.105-in-diameter wire is the closest to satisfying all requirements. The value of C/H1100512.14 is not a serious deviation and can be tolerated. However, the tight constraint on Lsneeds to be addressed. If the assembly conditions can be relaxed to accept a solid height of 1.116 in, we have a solution. If not, the only other possibility is to use the 0.112-in diameter and accept a value C/H1100514, individually package the springs, and possibly reconsider supporting the spring in service. 10–11 Extension Springs Extension springs differ from compression springs in that they carry tensile loading, they require some means of transferring the load from the support to the body of the spring, and the spring body is wound with an initial tension. The load transfer can be done with a threaded plug or a swivel hook; both of these add to the cost of the ﬁn- ished product, and so one of the methods shown in Fig. 10–5 is usually employed. Stresses in the body of the extension spring are handled the same as compres- sion springs.

(10–9) is Na=Nb+G E(10–40) where Gand Eare the shear and tensile moduli of elasticity, respectively (see Prob. 10–38). The initial tension in an extension spring is created in the winding process by twisting the wire as it is wound onto the mandrel. When the spring is completed and removed from the mandrel, the initial tension is locked in because the spring cannot get any shorter. The amount of initial tension that a springmaker can routinely incor- porate is as shown in Fig. 10–7 c.

The end hooks are usually the weakest part, with bending usually controlling. We should also appreciate that a fatigue failure separates the extension spring under load. Flying fragments, lost load, and machine shutdown are threats to personal safety as well as machine function. For these reasons higher design factors are used in extension-spring design than in the design of compression springs. In Ex. 10–7 we estimated the endurance limit for the hook in bending using the Zimmerli data, which are based on torsion in compression springs and the distortion theory. An alternative method is to use Table 10–8, which is based on a stress-ratio ofR=τmin/τmax=0. For this case, τa=τm=τmax/2.

It is usually close-wound, as is a helical coil extension spring, but with negligible initial tension. There are single-bodied and double-bodied types as depicted in Fig. 10–8. As shown in the ﬁgure, torsion springs have ends conﬁgured to apply torsion to the coil body in a convenient manner, with short hook, hinged straight offset, straight torsion, and special ends. The ends ultimately connect a force at a distance from the coil axis to apply a torque. The most frequently encountered (and least expensive) end is the straight torsion end. If intercoil friction is to be avoided completely, the spring can be wound with a pitch that just separates the body coils. Helical coil torsion springs are usually used with a rod or arbor for reactive support when ends cannot be built in, to maintain alignment, and to provide buckling resistance if necessary. The wire in a torsion spring is in bending, in contrast to the torsion encountered in helical coil compression and extension springs. The springs are designed to wind tighter in service. As the applied torque increases, the inside diameter of the coil decreases. Care must be taken so that the coils do not interfere with the pin, rod, or arbor. The bending mode in the coil might seem to invite square- or rectangular-cross- section wire, but cost, range of materials, and availability discourage its use.bud29281_ch10_517-568.qxd 12/16/2009 7:14 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Mechanical Springs 551 Torsion springs are familiar in clothespins, window shades, and animal traps, where they may be seen around the house, and out of sight in counterbalance mech- anisms, ratchets, and a variety of other machine components. There are many stock springs that can be purchased off-the-shelf from a vendor. This selection can add economy of scale to small projects, avoiding the cost of custom design and small- run manufacture. Describing the End Location In specifying a torsion spring, the ends must be located relative to each other. Commer- cial tolerances on these relative positions are listed in Table 10–9. The simplest scheme for expressing the initial unloaded location of one end with respect to the other is in terms of an angle βdeﬁning the partial turn present in the coil body as Np=β/360°, as shown in Fig. 10–9. For analysis purposes the nomenclature of Fig. 10–9 can be used. Commu- nication with a springmaker is often in terms of the back-angle α. The number of body turns Nbis the number of turns in the free spring body by count. The body-turn count is related to the initial position angle βby Nb=integer +β 360◦=integer +NpFigure 10–8 Torsion springs. (Courtesy of Associated Spring.)

The above equation means that Nbtakes on noninteger, discrete values such as 5.3, 6.3, 7.3,..., with successive differences of 1 as possibilities in designing a speciﬁc spring. This consideration will be discussed later. Bending Stress A torsion spring has bending induced in the coils, rather than torsion. This means that residual stresses built in during winding are in the same direction but of opposite sign to the working stresses that occur during use. The strain-strengthening locks in resid- ual stresses opposing working stresses provided the load is always applied in the wind- ing sense. Torsion springs can operate at bending stresses exceeding the yield strength of the wire from which it was wound. The bending stress can be obtained from curved-beam theory expressed in the form σ=KMc I where Kis a stress-correction factor. The value of Kdepends on the shape of the wire cross section and whether the stress sought is at the inner or outer ﬁber. Wahl analytically determined the values of Kto be, for round wire, Ki=4C2−C−1 4C(C−1)Ko=4C2+C−1 4C(C+1)(10–43) where Cis the spring index and the subscripts iandorefer to the inner and outer ﬁbers, respectively. In view of the fact that Kois always less than unity, we shall use Kito estimate the stresses. When the bending moment is M=Frand the section modulus I/c=d3/32, we express the bending equation as σ=Ki32Fr πd3(10–44) which gives the bending stress for a round-wire torsion spring. Deﬂection and Spring Rate For torsion springs, angular deﬂection can be expressed in radians or revolutions (turns). If a term contains revolution units the term will be expressed with a prime sign. The spring rate k/primeis expressed in units of torque/revolution ( lbf·in/rev or N·mm/r ev) and moment is proportional to angle θ/primeexpressed in turns rather than radians. The spring rate, if linear, can be expressed as k/prime=M1 θ/prime 1=M2 θ/prime 2=M2−M1 θ/prime 2−θ/prime 1(10–45) where the moment Mcan be expressed as Flor Fr.Figure 10–9 The free-end location angle is β.

When the load is applied to a torsion spring, the spring winds up, causing a decrease in the inside diameter of the coil body. It is necessary to ensure that the inside diameter of the coil never becomes equal to or less than the diameter of the pin, in which case loss of spring function would ensue. The helix diameter of the coil D/primebecomes D/prime=NbD Nb+θ/primec(10–53) where θ/prime cis the angular deﬂection of the body of the coil in number of turns, given by θ/prime c=10.8MDN b d4E(10–54) The new inside diameter D/prime i=D/prime−dmakes the diametral clearance /Delta1between the body coil and the pin of diameter Dpequal to /Delta1=D/prime−d−Dp=NbD Nb+θ/primec−d−Dp (10–55) Equation (10–55) solved for Nbis Nb=θ/prime c(/Delta1+d+Dp) D−/Delta1−d−Dp(10–56) which gives the number of body turns corresponding to a speciﬁed diametral clear- ance of the arbor. This angle may not be in agreement with the necessary partial-turn remainder. Thus the diametral clearance may be exceeded but not equaled.

Although the mathematical treatment is beyond the scope of this book, you should at least become familiar with the remarkable characteristics of these springs. Aside from the obvious advantage that a Belleville spring occupies only a small space, variation in the h/tratio will produce a wide variety of load-deﬂection curve shapes, as illustrated in Fig. 10–11. For example, using an h/tratio of 2.83 or larger gives an S curve that might be useful for snap-acting mechanisms. A reduction of the ratio to a value between 1.41 and 2.1 causes the central portion of the curve to become horizontal, which means that the load is constant over a considerable deﬂection range. A higher load for a given deﬂection may be obtained by nesting, that is, by stack- ing the springs in parallel. On the other hand, stacking in series provides a larger deﬂection for the same load, but in this case there is danger of instability.bud29281_ch10_517-568.qxd 12/16/2009 7:14 pm pinnacle 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:558 Mechanical Engineering Design 10–14 Miscellaneous Springs The extension spring shown in Fig. 10–12 is made of slightly curved strip steel, not ﬂat, so that the force required to uncoil it remains constant; thus it is called a constant- force spring . This is equivalent to a zero spring rate. Such springs can also be man- ufactured having either a positive or a negative spring rate. A volute spring, shown in Fig. 10–13 a, is a wide, thin strip, or “ﬂat,” of mater- ial wound on the ﬂat so that the coils ﬁt inside one another. Since the coils do not stack, the solid height of the spring is the width of the strip. A variable-spring scale, in a compression volute spring, is obtained by permitting the coils to contact the sup- port. Thus, as the deﬂection increases, the number of active coils decreases. The volute spring has another important advantage that cannot be obtained with round-wire springs: if the coils are wound so as to contact or slide on one another during action, the sliding friction will serve to damp out vibrations or other unwanted transient disturbances. A conical spring, as the name implies, is a coil spring wound in the shape of a cone (see Prob. 10–28). Most conical springs are compression springs and are wound with round wire. But a volute spring is a conical spring too. Probably the principal advantage of this type of spring is that it can be wound so that the solid height is only a single wire diameter. Flat stock is used for a great variety of springs, such as clock springs, power springs, torsion springs, cantilever springs, and hair springs; frequently it is specially shaped to create certain spring actions for fuse clips, relay springs, spring washers, snap rings, and retainers. In designing many springs of ﬂat stock or strip material, it is often economical and of value to proportion the material so as to obtain a constant stress throughout the spring material. A uniform-section cantilever spring has a stress σ=M I/c=Fx I/c(a)Figure 10–11 Load-deﬂection curves for Belleville springs.

But there is no reason why I/cneed be a constant. For example, one might design such a spring as that shown in Fig. 10–13 b, in which the thickness his constant but the width bis per- mitted to vary.

To demonstrate this, assume that deﬂection of the triangular ﬂat spring is primarily due to bending and we can neglect the transverse shear force.13The bending moment as a function of xis M=− Fxand the beam width at xcan be expressedFigure 10–13 (a) A volute spring; ( b) a ﬂat triangular spring.lF hx bo bF (a)( b)Figure 10–12 Constant-force spring.

This is also true for most of the miscellaneous springs mentioned in this section, and you should now experience no difﬁculty in reading and understanding the literature of such springs. 10–15 Summary In this chapter we have considered helical coil springs in considerable detail in order to show the importance of viewpoint in approaching engineering problems, their analysis, and design. For compression springs undergoing static and fatigue loads, the complete design process was presented. This was not done for extension and torsion springs, as the process is the same, although the governing conditions are not. The governing conditions, however, were provided and extension to the design process from what was provided for the compression spring should be straightforward. Prob- lems are provided at the end of the chapter, and it is hoped that the reader will develop additional, similar, problems to tackle. Stochastic considerations are notably missing in this chapter. The complexity and nuances of the deterministic approach alone are enough to handle in a ﬁrst presenta- tion of spring design. Springmakers offer a vast array of information concerning tol- erances on springs.14This, together with the material in Chaps. 5, 6, and 20, should provide the reader with ample ability to advance and incorporate statistical analyses in their design evaluations. As spring problems become more computationally involved, programmable cal- culators and computers must be used. Spreadsheet programming is very popular for repetitive calculations. As mentioned earlier, commercial programs are available. With these programs, backsolving can be performed; that is, when the ﬁnal objective criteria are entered, the program determines the input values.

Hint: Using Castigliano’s theorem, determine the deﬂection due to bending of an end hook alone as if the hook were ﬁxed at the end connecting it to the body of the spring. Consider the wire diameter dsmall as compared to the mean radius of the hook, R=D/2. Add the deﬂections of the end hooks to the deﬂection of the main body to deter- mine the ﬁnal spring constant, then equate it to Eq.

It is formed by winding A227 hard-drawn steel wire around a mandrel to obtain 21 2turns when the grip is in the closed position. After winding, the wire is cut to leave the two legs as handles. The plastic handles are then molded on, the grip is squeezed together, and a wire clip is placed around the legs to obtain initial “tension” and to space the handles for the best initial gripping position. The clip is formed like a ﬁgure 8 to prevent it from com- ing off. When the grip is in the closed position, the stress in the spring should not exceed the permissible stress.

In a rolling bearing the starting friction is about twice the running friction, but still it is negligible in comparison with the starting friction of a sleeve bearing. Load, speed, and the operating viscosity of the lubricant do affect the frictional characteristics of a rolling bearing. It is probably a mistake to describe a rolling bearing as “antifriction,” but the term is used generally throughout the industry. From the mechanical designer’s standpoint, the study of antifriction bearings differs in several respects when compared with the study of other topics because the bearings they specify have already been designed. The specialist in antifriction-bearing design is confronted with the problem of designing a group of elements that compose a rolling bearing: these elements must be designed to ﬁt into a space whose dimen- sions are speciﬁed; they must be designed to receive a load having certain character- istics; and ﬁnally, these elements must be designed to have a satisfactory life when operated under the speciﬁed conditions. Bearing specialists must therefore consider such matters as fatigue loading, friction, heat, corrosion resistance, kinematic prob- lems, material properties, lubrication, machining tolerances, assembly, use, and cost. From a consideration of all these factors, bearing specialists arrive at a compromise that, in their judgment, is a good solution to the problem as stated. We begin with an overview of bearing types; then we note that bearing life cannot be described in deterministic form. We introduce the invariant, the statistical distribution of life, which is strongly Weibullian.1There are some useful deterministic equations addressing load versus life at constant reliability, and we introduce the catalog rating at rating life. The reliability-life relationship involves Weibullian statistics. The load-life-reliability relationship, combines statistical and deterministic relationships giving the designer a way to move from the desired load and life to the catalog rating in oneequation. Ball bearings also resist thrust, and a unit of thrust does different damage per rev- olution than a unit of radial load, so we must ﬁnd the equivalent pure radial load that does the same damage as the existing radial and thrust loads. Next, variable loading, stepwise and continuous, is approached, and the equivalent pure radial load doing the same damage is quantiﬁed. Oscillatory loading is mentioned. With this preparation we have the tools to consider the selection of ball and cylin- drical roller bearings. The question of misalignment is quantitatively approached. Tapered roller bearings have some complications, and our experience so far con- tributes to understanding them. Having the tools to ﬁnd the proper catalog ratings, we make decisions (selec- tions), we perform a design assessment, and the bearing reliability is quantiﬁed. Lubri- cation and mounting conclude our introduction. Vendors’ manuals should be consulted for speciﬁc details relating to bearings of their manufacture. 11–1 Bearing Types Bearings are manufactured to take pure radial loads, pure thrust loads, or a combination of the two kinds of loads. The nomenclature of a ball bearing is illustrated in Fig. 11–1, which also shows the four essential parts of a bearing. These are the outer ring, the inner ring, the balls or rolling elements, and the separator. In low-priced bearings, the 1To completely understand the statistical elements of this chapter, the reader is urged to review Chap. 20, Secs. 20–1 through 20–3.bud29281_ch11_569-616.qxd 12/16/09 9:02 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Rolling-Contact Bearings 571 Figure 11–1 Nomenclature of a ball bearing. (General Motors Corp. Used with permission, GM Media Archives.) separator is sometimes omitted, but it has the important function of separating the elements so that rubbing contact will not occur. In this section we include a selection from the many types of standardized bear- ings that are manufactured. Most bearing manufacturers provide engineering manuals and brochures containing lavish descriptions of the various types available. In the small space available here, only a meager outline of some of the most common types can be given. So you should include a survey of bearing manufacturers’ literature in your stud- ies of this section. Some of the various types of standardized bearings that are manufactured are shown in Fig. 11–2. The single-row deep-groove bearing will take radial load as well as some thrust load. The balls are inserted into the grooves by moving the inner ring+ (a) Deep groove(b) Filling notch(c) Angular contact(d) Shielded (f) External self-aligning(g) Double row(h) Self-aligning(i) Thrust(j) Self-aligning thrust+ + + ++ + ++(e) Sealed+Figure 11–2 Various types of ball bearings.bud29281_ch11_569-616.qxd 12/16/09 9:02 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:572 Mechanical Engineering Design (a) (d)( e)( f)(b)( c)Figure 11–3 Types of roller bearings: (a) straight roller; ( b) spherical roller, thrust; ( c) tapered roller, thrust; ( d) needle; ( e) tapered roller; ( f) steep-angle tapered roller.

The use of a ﬁlling notch (Fig. 11–2 b) in the inner and outer rings enables a greater number of balls to be inserted, thus increasing the load capacity. The thrust capacity is decreased, however, because of the bumping of the balls against the edge of the notch when thrust loads are present. The angular-contact bearing (Fig. 11–2 c) provides a greater thrust capacity. All these bearings may be obtained with shields on one or both sides. The shields are not a complete closure but do offer a measure of protection against dirt. A vari- ety of bearings are manufactured with seals on one or both sides. When the seals are on both sides, the bearings are lubricated at the factory. Although a sealed bearing is supposed to be lubricated for life, a method of relubrication is sometimes provided. Single-row bearings will withstand a small amount of shaft misalignment of deﬂec- tion, but where this is severe, self-aligning bearings may be used. Double-row bear- ings are made in a variety of types and sizes to carry heavier radial and thrust loads. Sometimes two single-row bearings are used together for the same reason, although a double-row bearing will generally require fewer parts and occupy less space. The one- way ball thrust bearings (Fig. 11–2 i) are made in many types and sizes. Some of the large variety of standard roller bearings available are illustrated in Fig. 11–3. Straight roller bearings (Fig. 11–3 a) will carry a greater radial load than ball bearings of the same size because of the greater contact area. However, they have the disadvantage of requiring almost perfect geometry of the raceways and rollers. A slight misalignment will cause the rollers to skew and get out of line. For this reason, the retainer must be heavy. Straight roller bearings will not, of course, take thrust loads. Helical rollers are made by winding rectangular material into rollers, after which they are hardened and ground. Because of the inherent ﬂexibility, they will take con- siderable misalignment. If necessary, the shaft and housing can be used for raceways instead of separate inner and outer races. This is especially important if radial space is limited.bud29281_ch11_569-616.qxd 12/16/09 9:02 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Rolling-Contact Bearings 573 The spherical-roller thrust bearing (Fig. 11–3 b) is useful where heavy loads and misalignment occur. The spherical elements have the advantage of increasing their contact area as the load is increased. Needle bearings (Fig. 11–3 d) are very useful where radial space is limited. They have a high load capacity when separators are used, but may be obtained without sep- arators. They are furnished both with and without races. Tapered roller bearings (Fig. 11–3 e, f) combine the advantages of ball and straight roller bearings, since they can take either radial or thrust loads or any com- bination of the two, and in addition, they have the high load-carrying capacity of straight roller bearings. The tapered roller bearing is designed so that all elements in the roller surface and the raceways intersect at a common point on the bearing axis. The bearings described here represent only a small portion of the many available for selection. Many special-purpose bearings are manufactured, and bearings are also made for particular classes of machinery. Typical of these are: •Instrument bearings, which are high-precision and are available in stainless steel and high-temperature materials •Nonprecision bearings, usually made with no separator and sometimes having split or stamped sheet-metal races •Ball bushings, which permit either rotation or sliding motion or both •Bearings with ﬂexible rollers 11–2 Bearing Life When the ball or roller of rolling-contact bearings rolls, contact stresses occur on the inner ring, the rolling element, and on the outer ring. Because the curvature of the contacting elements in the axial direction is different from that in the radial direction, the equations for these stresses are more involved than in the Hertz equations pre- sented in Chap. 3. If a bearing is clean and properly lubricated, is mounted and sealed against the entrance of dust and dirt, is maintained in this condition, and is operated at reasonable temperatures, then metal fatigue will be the only cause of failure. Inasmuch as metal fatigue implies many millions of stress applications successfully endured, we need a quantitative life measure. Common life measures are •Number of revolutions of the inner ring (outer ring stationary) until the ﬁrst tangible evidence of fatigue •Number of hours of use at a standard angular speed until the ﬁrst tangible evidence of fatigue The commonly used term is bearing life, which is applied to either of the measures just mentioned. It is important to realize, as in all fatigue, life as deﬁned above is a sto- chastic variable and, as such, has both a distribution and associated statistical parame- ters. The life measure of an individual bearing is deﬁned as the total number of revo- lutions (or hours at a constant speed) of bearing operation until the failure criterion is developed. Under ideal conditions, the fatigue failure consists of spalling of the load- carrying surfaces. The American Bearing Manufacturers Association (ABMA) standard states that the failure criterion is the ﬁrst evidence of fatigue. The fatigue criterion used by the Timken Company laboratories is the spalling or pitting of an area of 0.01 in2. Timken also observes that the useful life of the bearing may extend considerably beyond this point. This is an operational deﬁnition of fatigue failure in rolling bearings.bud29281_ch11_569-616.qxd 12/17/09 8:46 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:574 Mechanical Engineering Design log Llog F 0Figure 11–4 Typical bearing load-life log-log curve.The rating life is a term sanctioned by the ABMA and used by most manufactur- ers. The rating life of a group of nominally identical ball or roller bearings is deﬁned as the number of revolutions (or hours at a constant speed) that 90 percent of a group of bearings will achieve or exceed before the failure criterion develops. The terms minimum life,L10life,and B10lifeare also used as synonyms for rating life. The rating life is the 10th percentile location of the bearing group’s revolutions-to-failure distribution. Median life is the 50th percentile life of a group of bearings. The term average lifehas been used as a synonym for median life, contributing to confusion. When many groups of bearings are tested, the median life is between 4 and 5 times the L10life. Each bearing manufacturer will choose a speciﬁc rating life for which load ratings of its bearings are reported. The most commonly used rating life is 106revolutions. The Timken Company is a well-known exception, rating its bearings at 3 000 hours at 500 rev/min, which is 90(106) revolutions. These levels of rating life are actually quite low for today’s bearings, but since rating life is an arbitrary reference point, the traditional values have generally been maintained. 11–3 Bearing Load Life at Rated Reliability When nominally identical groups are tested to the life-failure criterion at different loads, the data are plotted on a graph as depicted in Fig. 11–4 using a log-log trans- formation. To establish a single point, load F1and the rating life of group one (L10)1 are the coordinates that are logarithmically transformed. The reliability associated with this point, and all other points, is 0.90. Thus we gain a glimpse of the load-life func- tion at 0.90 reliability. Using a regression equation of the form FL1/a=constant (11–1) the result of many tests for various kinds of bearings result in •a=3for ball bearings •a=10/3for roller bearings (cylindrical and tapered roller) A catalog load rating is deﬁned as the radial load that causes 10 percent of a group of bearings to fail at the bearing manufacturer’s rating life. We shall denote the catalog load rating as C10. The catalog load rating is often referred to as a Basic Dynamic Load Rating, or sometimes just Basic Load Rating, if the manufacturer’s rating life is 106rev- olutions. The radial load that would be necessary to cause failure at such a low life would be unrealistically high. Consequently, the Basic Load Rating should be viewed as a reference value, and not as an actual load to be achieved by a bearing.bud29281_ch11_569-616.qxd 12/16/09 9:02 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Rolling-Contact Bearings 575 In selecting a bearing for a given application, it is necessary to relate the desired load and life requirements to the published catalog load rating corresponding to the catalog rating life. From Eq. (11–1) we can write F1L1/a 1=F2L1/a 2(11–2) where the subscripts 1 and 2 can refer to any set of load and life conditions. Letting F1and L1correlate with the catalog load rating and rating life, and F2and L2corre- late with desired load and life for the application, we can express Eq. (11–2) as FRL1/a R=FDL1/a D(a) where the units of LRand LDare revolutions, and the subscripts Rand Dstand for Rated and Desired. It is sometimes convenient to express the life in hours at a given speed. Accord- ingly, any life Lin revolutions can be expressed as L=60/L1n (b) where /L1is in hours, nis in rev/min, and 60 min/h is the appropriate conversion factor. Incorporating Eq. ( b) into Eq. ( a), FR(/L1RnR60)1/a=FD(/L1DnD60)1/a(c) catalog rating, lbf or kN desired speed, rev/min rating life in hours desired life, hours rating speed, rev/min desired radial load, lbf or kN Solving Eq. ( c) for FR, and noting that it is simply an alternate notation for the cat- alog load rating C10, we obtain an expression for a catalog load rating as a function of the desired load, desired life, and catalog rating life. C10=FR=FD/parenleftbiggLD LR/parenrightbigg1/a =FD/parenleftbigg/L1DnD60 /L1RnR60/parenrightbigg1/a (11–3) It is sometimes convenient to deﬁne xD=LD/LRas a dimensionless multiple of rating life. EXAMPLE 11–1 Consider SKF, which rates its bearings for 1 million revolutions. If you desire a life of 5000 h at 1725 rev/min with a load of 400 lbf with a reliability of 90 percent, for which catalog rating would you search in an SKF catalog?

Candidates for a distributional curve ﬁt include lognormal and Weibull. The Weibull is by far the most popular, largely because of its ability to adjust to varying amounts of skewness. If the life measure is expressed in dimensionless form as x=L/L10, then the reliability can be expressed as [see Eq. (20–24), p. 990] R=exp/bracketleftBigg −/parenleftbiggx−x0 θ−x0/parenrightbiggb/bracketrightBigg (11–4) where R=reliability x=life measure dimensionless variate, L/L10 x0=guaranteed, or “minimum,’’ value of the variate θ=characteristic parameter corresponding to the 63.2121 percentile value of the variate b=shape parameter that controls the skewness Because there are three distributional parameters, x0, θ, and b, the Weibull has a robust ability to conform to a data string. Also, in Eq. (11–4) an explicit expression for the cumulative distribution function is possible: F=1−R=1−exp/bracketleftBigg −/parenleftbiggx−x0 θ−x0/parenrightbiggb/bracketrightBigg (11–5) EXAMPLE 11–2 Construct the distributional properties of a 02-30 millimeter deep-groove ball bearing if the Weibull parameters are x0=0.02, (θ−x0)=4.439, and b=1.483. Find the mean, median, 10th percentile life, standard deviation, and coefﬁcient of variation. Solution From Eq.

The desired load is not the manufacturer’s test load or catalog entry. The desired speed is different from the vendor’s test speed, and the reliability expectation is typically much higher than the 0.90 accompanying the catalog entry. Figure 11–5 shows the situation. The catalog information is plotted as point A, whose coordinates are (the logs of) C10and x10=L10/L10=1, a point on the 0.90 reliability contour. The design point is at D, with the coordinates (the logs of) FD and xD, a point that is on the R=RDreliability contour. The designer must move from point Dto point Avia point Bas follows.

Typical load application fac- tors for certain types of applications will be discussed shortly. Eq. (11–6) can be simpliﬁed slightly for calculator entry by noting that ln1 RD=ln1 1−pf=ln(1+pf+···).=pf=1−RD where pfis the probability for failure. Equation (11–6) can be written as C10.=afFD/bracketleftbiggxD x0+(θ−x0)(1−RD)1/b/bracketrightbigg1/a R≥0.90 (11–7) Either Eq. (11–6) or Eq. (11–7) may be used to convert from a design situation with a desired load, life, and reliability to a catalog load rating based on a rating life at 90 percent reliability. Note that when RD=0.90, the denominator is equal to one, and the equation reduces to Eq. (11–3). The Weibull parameters are usually provided in the manufacturer’s catalog. Typical values are given on p. 608 at the beginning of the end-of-chapter problems. EXAMPLE 11–3 The design load on a ball bearing is 413 lbf and an application factor of 1.2 is appro- priate. The speed of the shaft is to be 300 rev/min, the life to be 30 kh with a reliability of 0.99. What is the C10catalog entry to be sought (or exceeded) when searching for a deep-groove bearing in a manufacturer’s catalog on the basis of 106revolutions for rat- ing life? The Weibull parameters are x0=0.02,(θ−x0)=4.439, and b=1.483. Solution xD=LD LR=60/L1DnD L10=60(30 000 )300 106=540 Thus, the design life is 540 times the L10life. For a ball bearing, a=3.

Often these bearings are different. If the bear- ing reliability of the shaft with its pair of bearings is to be R, then Ris related to the individual bearing reliabilities RAand RBby R=RARB First, we observe that if the product RARBequals R, then, in general, RAand RBare both greater than R. Since the failure of either or both of the bearings results in the shutdown of the shaft, then Aor Bor both can create a failure. Second, in sizing bear- ings one can begin by making RAand RBequal to the square root of the reliability goal, √ R. In Ex. 11–3, if the bearing was one of a pair, the reliability goal would be√ 0.99, or 0.995. The bearings selected are discrete in their reliability property in your problem, so the selection procedure “rounds up,” and the overall reliability exceeds the goal R. Third, it may be possible, if RA>√ R, to round down on Byet have the product RARBstill exceed the goal R. 11–6 Combined Radial and Thrust Loading A ball bearing is capable of resisting radial loading and a thrust loading. Furthermore, these can be combined. Consider Faand Frto be the axial thrust and radial loads, respectively, and Feto be the equivalent radial load that does the same damage as the combined radial and thrust loads together. A rotation factor Vis deﬁned such thatV=1when the inner ring rotates and V=1.2when the outer ring rotates. Two dimensionless groups can now be formed: Fe/VF rand Fa/VF r. When these two dimensionless groups are plotted as in Fig. 11–6, the data fall in a gentle curve that is well approximated by two straight-line segments. The abscissa eis deﬁned by the intersection of the two lines.

It is common to express Eqs. (11–8 a) and (11–8 b) as a single equation, Fe=XiVF r+YiFa (11–9) where i=1when Fa/VF r≤eand i=2when Fa/VF r>e. The Xand Yfactors depend upon the geometry and construction of the speciﬁc bearing. Table 11–1 lists representative values of X1, Y1, X2, and Y2as a function of e, which in turn is a func- tion of Fa/C0, where C0is the basic static load rating. The basic static load rating is the load that will produce a total permanent deformation in the raceway and rolling element at any contact point of 0.0001 times the diameter of the rolling element. The basic static load rating is typically tabulated, along with the basic dynamic load rat- ing C10, in bearing manufacturers’ publications. See Table 11–2, for example. In these equations, the rotation factor Vis intended to correct for the rotating- ring conditions. The factor of 1.2 for outer-ring rotation is simply an acknowledgment that the fatigue life is reduced under these conditions. Self-aligning bearings are an exception: they have V=1for rotation of either ring. Since straight or cylindrical roller bearings will take no axial load, or very little, the Yfactor is always zero. The ABMA has established standard boundary dimensions for bearings, which deﬁne the bearing bore, the outside diameter (OD), the width, and the ﬁllet sizes on the shaft and housing shoulders. The basic plan covers all ball and straight roller bear- ings in the metric sizes. The plan is quite ﬂexible in that, for a given bore, there is an assortment of widths and outside diameters. Furthermore, the outside diameters selected are such that, for a particular outside diameter, one can usually ﬁnd a variety of bearings having different bores and widths. This basic ABMA plan is illustrated in Fig. 11–7. The bearings are identiﬁed by a two-digit number called the dimension-series code . The ﬁrst number in the code is from the width series, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The second number is from the diameter series (outside), 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Figure 11–7 shows the variety of bearings that may be obtained with a particular bore.

The same is true for a load level F2; that is, the area under the F2-L2trace is numerically equal to K. The linear damage theory says that in the case of load level F1, the area from L=0toL=LAdoes damage measured by Fa 1LA=D. Consider the piecewise continuous cycle depicted in Fig. 11–10. The loads Fei are equivalent steady radial loads for combined radial–thrust loads.

The equivalent steady load Feqwhen run for l1+l2+l3revolutions does the same damage D. Thus D=Fa eq(l1+l2+l3) (c) Equating Eqs.

Helical gears transmit components of force in the tangential, radial, and axial directions (see Chap. 13). The components of the gear force transmitted to the second shaft are shown in Fig. 11–12, at point A. The bearing reactions at Cand D, assuming simple-supports, are also shown. A ball bearing is to be selected for location Cto accept the thrust, and a cylindrical roller bearing is to be utilized at location D.

Choose a 02-25 mm series, or a 03-25 mm series cylindrical roller bearing from Table 11–3. (b) The ball bearing at Cinvolves a thrust component.

As we address the differences between tapered roller and ball and cylindrical roller bearings, note that the underlying fundamentals are the same, but that there are differences in detail. Moreover, bearing and cup combinations are not necessarily priced in propor- tion to capacity. Any catalog displays a mix of high-production, low-production, and successful special-order designs. Bearing suppliers have computer programs that will take your problem descriptions, give intermediate design assessment information, and list a number of satisfactory cup-and-cone combinations in order of decreasing cost.bud29281_ch11_569-616.qxd 12/16/09 9:02 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Rolling-Contact Bearings 591 Company sales ofﬁces provide access to comprehensive engineering services to help designers select and apply their bearings. At a large original equipment manufacturer’s plant, there may be a resident bearing company representative. Bearing suppliers provide a wealth of engineering information and detail in their cat- alogs and engineering guides, both in print and online. It is strongly recommended that the designer become familiar with the speciﬁcs of the supplier. It will usually utilize a similar approach as presented here, but may include various modifying factors for such things as temperature and lubrication. Many of the suppliers will provide online software tools to aid in bearing selection. The engineer will always beneﬁt from a general under- standing of the theory utilized in such software tools. Our goal here is to introduce the vocabulary, show congruence to fundamentals that were learned earlier, offer examples, and develop conﬁdence. Finally, problems should reinforce the learning experience. The four components of a tapered roller bearing assembly are the •Cone (inner ring) •Cup (outer ring) •Tapered rollers •Cage (spacer-retainer) The assembled bearing consists of two separable parts: (1) the cone assembly: the cone, the rollers, and the cage; and (2) the cup. Bearings can be made as single-row, two- row, four-row, and thrust-bearing assemblies. Additionally, auxiliary components such as spacers and closures can be used. Figure 11–13 shows the nomenclature of a tapered roller bearing, and the point Gthrough which radial and axial components of load act. A tapered roller bearing can carry both radial and thrust (axial) loads, or any com- bination of the two. However, even when an external thrust load is not present, the radial Cup outside diameter (OD) D Cone bore dCup back face radius r Cup back faceCup front face radius Cup front face Cage Cone front faceCone back face radius R Standout FCone front face rib Cone front face radiusCone back faceCone back face ribBearing width T Cone length BCup length C G a Roller CupConeFigure 11–13 Nomenclature of a tapered roller bearing.

(Courtesy of The Timken Company.) load will induce a thrust reaction within the bearing because of the taper. To avoid the separation of the races and the rollers, this thrust must be resisted by an equal and oppo- site force. One way of generating this force is to always use at least two tapered roller bearings on a shaft. Two bearings can be mounted with the cone backs facing each other, in a conﬁguration called direct mounting, or with the cone fronts facing each other, in what is called indirect mounting. Figure 11–14 shows a pair of tapered roller bearings mounted directly ( b) and indirectly ( a) with the bearing reaction locations A0and B0shown for the shaft. For the shaft as a beam, the span is ae, the effective spread. It is through points A0and B0that the radial loads act perpendicular to the shaft axis, and the thrust loads act along the shaft axis. The geometric spread agfor the direct mounting is greater than for the indirect mounting. With indirect mounting the bearings are closer together compared to the direct mounting; however, the system stability is the same ( aeis the same in both cases). Thus direct and indirect mounting involve space and compact- ness needed or desired, but with the same system stability. In addition to the usual ratings and geometry information, catalog data for tapered roller bearings will include the location of the effective force center. Two sample pages from a Timk en catalog are shown in Fig. 11–15. A radial load on a tapered roller bearing will induce a thrust reaction. The load zone includes about half the rollers and subtends an angle of approximately 180◦. Using the symbol Fifor the induced thrust load from a radial load with a 180◦load zone, Timken provides the equation Fi=0.47Fr K(11–15) where the Kfactor is geometry-speciﬁc, and is the ratio of the radial load rating to the thrust load rating. The Kfactor can be ﬁrst approximated with 1.5 for a radialbud29281_ch11_569-616.qxd 12/16/09 9:02 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Rolling-Contact Bearings 593 SINGLE-ROW STRAIGHT BORE TCBD Db d db Dada Rar 52.000 2.0472 52.000 2.0472 52.000 2.0472 62.000 2.4409 62.000 2.4409 50.005 1.9687 50.005 1.9687 50.005 1.9687 50.292 1.9800 50.292 1.9800 51.994 2.0470 56.896 2.2400 57.150 2.2500 58.738 2.3125 59.530 2.3437 60.325 2.3750 61.912 2.4375 62.000 2.4409 62.000 2.4409 16.250 0.6398 19.250 0.7579 22.000 0.8661 18.250 0.7185 25.250 0.9941 13.495 0.5313 13.495 0.5313 13.495 0.5313 14.224 0.5600 14.224 0.5600 15.011 0.5910 19.368 0.7625 19.431 0.7650 19.050 0.7500 23.368 0.9200 19.842 0.7812 19.050 0.7500 19.050 0.7500 19.050 0.7500 1.0 0.04 1.0 0.04 1.0 0.04 1.5 0.06 1.5 0.06 1.5 0.06 1.0 0.04 1.5 0.06 3.5 0.14 1.3 0.05 1.0 0.04 0.8 0.03 1.5 0.06 1.3 0.05 0.8 0.03 1.3 0.05 0.8 0.03 3.5 0.14 0.8 0.03 15.000 0.5906 18.000 0.7087 22.000 0.8661 17.000 0.6693 24.000 0.9449 14.260 0.5614 14.260 0.5614 14.260 0.5614 14.732 0.5800 14.732 0.5800 14.260 0.5614 19.837 0.7810 19.431 0.7650 19.355 0.7620 23.114 0.9100 17.462 0.6875 20.638 0.8125 20.638 0.8125 20.638 0.8125 30.5 1.20 34.0 1.34 34.0 1.34 32.5 1.28 35.0 1.38 31.5 1.24 30.5 1.20 31.5 1.24 36.0 1.42 31.5 1.24 30.5 1.20 30.5 1.20 36.0 1.42 32.5 1.28 36.0 1.42 32.5 1.28 32.5 1.28 38.0 1.50 32.5 1.28 29.0 1.14 31.0 1.22 30.5 1.20 30.0 1.18 31.5 1.24 29.5 1.16 29.5 1.16 29.5 1.16 29.5 1.16 29.5 1.16 29.5 1.16 30.0 1.18 33.0 1.30 30.5 1.20 32.5 1.27 30.5 1.20 31.5 1.24 31.5 1.24 31.5 1.24 1.0 0.04 1.0 0.04 1.0 0.04 1.5 0.06 1.5 0.06 1.0 0.04 1.0 0.04 1.0 0.04 1.3 0.05 1.3 0.05 1.3 0.05 1.3 0.05 1.5 0.06 1.3 0.05 1.5 0.06 1.5 0.06 2.0 0.08 1.3 0.05 1.3 0.05 13.000 0.5118 15.000 0.5906 18.000 0.7087 15.000 0.5906 20.000 0.7874 9.525 0.3750 9.525 0.3750 9.525 0.3750 10.668 0.4200 10.668 0.4200 12.700 0.5000 15.875 0.6250 14.732 0.5800 15.080 0.5937 18.288 0.7200 15.875 0.6250 14.288 0.5625 14.288 0.5625 14.288 0.562546.0 1.81 43.5 1.71 44.5 1.75 55.0 2.17 54.0 2.13 44.5 1.75 44.5 1.75 44.5 1.75 44.5 1.75 44.5 1.75 45.0 1.77 49.0 1.93 48.5 1.91 52.0 2.05 49.5 1.95 51.0 2.01 54.0 2.13 55.0 2.17 55.0 2.17 48.5 1.91 49.5 1.95 49.0 1.93 57.0 2.24 57.0 2.24 47.0 1.85 47.0 1.85 47.0 1.85 47.0 1.85 47.0 1.85 48.0 1.89 51.0 2.01 54.0 2.13 54.0 2.13 56.0 2.20 54.0 2.13 58.0 2.28 58.0 2.28 58.0 2.28 8190 1840 9520 2140 13200 2980 13000 2930 17400 3910 6990 1570 6990 1570 6990 1570 7210 1620 7210 1620 6990 1570 10900 2450 11700 2620 11600 2610 13900 3140 11000 2480 12100 2730 12100 2730 12100 2730 5260 1180 9510 2140 7960 1790 6680 1500 8930 2010 4810 1080 4810 1080 4810 1080 4620 1040 4620 1040 4810 1080 5740 1290 10900 2450 6560 1470 13000 2930 6550 1470 7280 1640 7280 1640 7280 1640 −3.6 −0.14 −3.0 −0.12 −7.6 −0.30 −5.1 −0.20 −9.7 −0.38 −2.8 −0.11 −2.8 −0.11 −2.8 −0.11 −3.3 −0.13 −3.3 −0.13 −2.8 −0.11 −6.9 −0.27 −3.0 −0.12 −5.8 −0.23 −5.1 −0.20 −5.1 −0.20 −5.8 −0.23 −5.8 −0.23 −5.8 −0.231.56 1.00 1.66 1.95 1.95 1.45 1.45 1.45 1.56 1.56 1.45 1.90 1.07 1.77 1.07 1.69 1.67 1.67 1.67 bore dD T K aN lbfN lbfoutside diameter width RB d b Db Da da1 2 rC1one- row radialthrustfac-torrating at 500 rpm for 3000 hours L 10 eff.loadcenter cone cuppart numbersmax shaft fillet radiuswidthbacking shoulder diametersbacking shoulder diametersmax hous- ing fillet radiuswidthcone cup 25.000 0.9843 25.000 0.9843 25.000 0.9843 25.000 0.9843 25.000 0.9843 25.159 0.9905 25.400 1.0000 25.400 1.0000 25.400 1.0000 25.400 1.0000 25.400 1.0000 25.400 1.0000 25.400 1.0000 25.400 1.0000 25.400 1.0000 25.400 1.0000 25.400 1.0000 25.400 1.0000 25.400 1.000030205 32205-B 33205 30305 32305 07096 07100 07100-S L44642 L44643 07100 1780 M84548 1986 M84249 15578 15101 15100 15101 30205 32205-B 33205 30305 32305 07196 07196 07196 L44610 .

After a possible bearing is identiﬁed, the exact value of Kfor each bearing can be found in the bearing catalog. A shaft supported by a pair of direct-mounted tapered roller bearings is shown in Fig. 11–16. Force vectors are shown as applied to the shaft. FrAand FrBare the radial loads carried by the bearings, applied at the effective force centers GAand GB. The induced loads FiAand FiBdue to the effect of the radial loads on the tapered bearings are also shown. Additionally, there may be an externally applied thrust load Faeon the shaft from some other source, such as the axial load on a helical gear. Since the bearings experience both radial and thrust loads, it is necessary to determine equivalent radial loads. Following the form of Eq. (11–9), where Fe=XVF r+YF a, Timken recommends using X=0.4and V=1for all cases, and using the Kfactor for the speciﬁc bearing for Y. This gives an equation of the form Fe=0.4Fr+KF a (a) The axial load Fais the net axial load carried by the bearing due to the combi- nation of the induced axial load from the other bearing and the external axial load. However, only one of the bearings will carry the net axial load, and which one it is depends on the direction the bearings are mounted, the relative magnitudes of the induced loads, the direction of the external load, and whether the shaft or the housing is the moving part. Timken handles it with a table containing each of the conﬁgurations and a sign convention on the external loads. It further requires the application to be oriented horizontally with left and right bearings that must match the left and right sign conventions. Here, we will present a method that gives equivalent results, but that is perhaps more conducive to visualizing and understanding the logic behind it. First, determine visually which bearing is being “squeezed” by the external thrust load, and label it as bearing A. Label the other bearing as bearing B. For example, in Fig. 11–16, the external thrust Faecauses the shaft to push to the left against the cone of the left bearing, squeezing it against the rollers and the cup. On the other hand, it tends to pull apart the cup from the right bearing. The left bearing is therefore labeled as bearing A. If the direction of Faewere reversed, then the right bearing would be labeled as bearing A. This approach to labeling the bearing being squeezed by theFigure 11–16 Direct-mounted tapered roller bearings, showing radial, induced thrust, and external thrust loads.

To clarify by example, consider the vertical shaft and cylinder in Fig. 11–17 with direct-mounted bearings. In Fig. 11–17 a, an external load is applied in the upward direction to a rotating shaft, compressing the top bearing, which should be labeled as bearing A. On the other hand, in Fig. 11–17 b, an upward external load is applied to a rotating outer cylinder with a stationary shaft. In this case, the lower bearing is being squeezed and should be labeled as bearing A. If there is no external thrust, then either bearing can arbitrarily be labeled as bearing A. Second, determine which bearing actually carries the net axial load. Generally, it would be expected that bearing Awould carry the axial load, since the external thrust Faeis directed toward A, along with the induced thrust FiBfrom bearing B. However, if the induced thrust FiAfrom bearing Ahappens to be larger than the combination of the external thrust and the thrust induced by bearing B, then bearing Bwill carry the net thrust load. We will use Eq. ( a) for the bearing carrying the thrust load. Timken recommends leaving the other bearing at its original radial load, rather than reducing it due to the negative net thrust load. The results are presented in equation form below, where the induced thrusts are deﬁned by Eq. (11–15).

(11–3), (11–6), or (11–7) as before. Timken uses a two-parameter Weibell model with x0=0, θ=4.48, and b=3/2. Note that since KAand KBare dependent on the speciﬁc bearing chosen, it may be necessary to iterate the process. EXAMPLE 11–8 The shaft depicted in Fig. 11–18 acarries a helical gear with a tangential force of 3980 N, a radial force of 1770 N, and a thrust force of 1690 N at the pitch cylinder with directions shown. The pitch diameter of the gear is 200 mm. The shaft runs at a speed of 800 rev/min, and the span (effective spread) between the direct-mount bearings is 150 mm. The design life is to be 5000 h and an application factor of 1 is appropriate. If the reliability of the bearing set is to be 0.99, select suitable single-row tapered- roller Timken bearings.

Note from Fig. 11–14 the effective load center is located at a=−5.8mm, that is, 5.8 mm into the cup from the back. Thus the shoulder-to-shoulder dimension should be 150−2(5.8)=138.4mm. Note that in each iteration of Eq. (11–7) to ﬁnd the catalog load rating, the bracketed portion of the equation is identical and need not be re-entered on a calculator each time. 11–10 Design Assessment for Selected Rolling-Contact Bearings In textbooks machine elements typically are treated singly. This can lead the reader to the presumption that a design assessment involves only that element, in this case a rolling-contact bearing. The immediately adjacent elements (the shaft journal and the housing bore) have immediate inﬂuence on the performance. Other elements, fur- ther removed (gears producing the bearing load), also have inﬂuence. Just as some say, “If you pull on something in the environment, you ﬁnd that it is attached to every- thing else.” This should be intuitively obvious to those involved with machinery. How, then, can one check shaft attributes that aren’t mentioned in a problem statement? Possibly, because the bearing hasn’t been designed yet (in ﬁne detail). All this points out the necessary iterative nature of designing, say, a speed reducer. If power, speed, and reduction are stipulated, then gear sets can be roughed in, their sizes, geometry, and location estimated, shaft forces and moments identified, bearings tentatively selected, seals identiﬁed; the bulk is beginning to make itself evident, the housing and lubricating scheme as well as the cooling considerations become clearer, shaft over- hangs and coupling accommodations appear. It is time to iterate, now addressing each element again, knowing much more about all of the others. When you have completed the necessary iterations, you will know what you need for the design assessment for the bearings. In the meantime you do as much of the design assessment as you can, avoiding bad selections, even if tentative. Always keep in mind that you eventually have to do it all in order to pronounce your completed design satisfactory.bud29281_ch11_569-616.qxd 12/16/09 9:02 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:600 Mechanical Engineering Design An outline of a design assessment for a rolling contact bearing includes, at a minimum, •Bearing reliability for the load imposed and life expected •Shouldering on shaft and housing satisfactory •Journal ﬁnish, diameter and tolerance compatible •Housing ﬁnish, diameter and tolerance compatible •Lubricant type according to manufacturer’s recommendations; lubricant paths and volume supplied to keep operating temperature satisfactory •Preloads, if required, are supplied Since we are focusing on rolling-contact bearings, we can address bearing reliability quantitatively, as well as shouldering.

From Table 11–2 a 02-40 mm deep- groove ball bearing would satisfy the requirement. If the bore in the application had to be 70 mm or larger (selecting a 02-70 mm deep-groove ball bearing), what is the resulting reliability?

When two bearings are made identical for simplicity, or reducing the number of spares, or other stipulation, and the loading is not the same, both can be made smaller and still meet a reliability goal. If the loading is disparate, then the more heavily loaded bearing can be chosen for a reliability goal just slightly larger than the overall goal. An additional example is useful to show what happens in cases of pure thrust loading.bud29281_ch11_569-616.qxd 12/16/09 9:02 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:602 Mechanical Engineering Design EXAMPLE 11–11 Consider a constrained housing as depicted in Fig. 11–19 with two direct-mount tapered roller bearings resisting an external thrust Faeof 8000 N.

Matters of Fit Table 11–2 (and Fig. 11–8), which shows the rating of single-row, 02-series, deep- groove and angular-contact ball bearings, includes shoulder diameters recommended for the shaft seat of the inner ring and the shoulder diameter of the outer ring, denoted dSand dH, respectively. The shaft shoulder can be greater than dSbut not enough to obstruct the annulus. It is important to maintain concentricity and perpendicularity with the shaft centerline, and to that end the shoulder diameter should equal or exceed dS. The housing shoulder diameter dHis to be equal to or less than dHto maintain concentricity and perpendicularity with the housing bore axis. Neither the shaft shoul- der nor the housing shoulder features should allow interference with the free move- ment of lubricant through the bearing annulus. In a tapered roller bearing (Fig. 11–15), the cup housing shoulder diameter should be equal to or less than Db. The shaft shoulder for the cone should be equal to or greater than db. Additionally, free lubricant ﬂow is not to be impeded by obstructing any of the annulus. In splash lubrication, common in speed reducers, the lubricant is thrown to the housing cover (ceiling) and is directed in its draining by ribs to a bear- ing. In direct mounting, a tapered roller bearing pumps oil from outboard to inboard. An oil passageway to the outboard side of the bearing needs to be provided. The oil returns to the sump as a consequence of bearing pump action. With an indirect mount, the oil is directed to the inboard annulus, the bearing pumping it to the outboard side. An oil passage from the outboard side to the sump has to be provided. 11–11 Lubrication The contacting surfaces in rolling bearings have a relative motion that is both rolling and sliding, and so it is difﬁcult to understand exactly what happens. If the relative velocity of the sliding surfaces is high enough, then the lubricant action isbud29281_ch11_569-616.qxd 12/21/09 4:57 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:604 Mechanical Engineering Design hydrodynamic (see Chap. 12). Elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHD) is the phe- nomenon that occurs when a lubricant is introduced between surfaces that are in pure rolling contact. The contact of gear teeth and that found in rolling bearings and in cam-and-follower surfaces are typical examples. When a lubricant is trapped between two surfaces in rolling contact, a tremendous increase in the pressure within the lubri- cant ﬁlm occurs. But viscosity is exponentially related to pressure, and so a very large increase in viscosity occurs in the lubricant that is trapped between the surfaces. Leibensperger2observes that the change in viscosity in and out of contact pressure is equivalent to the difference between cold asphalt and light sewing machine oil. The purposes of an antifriction-bearing lubricant may be summarized as follows: 1To provide a ﬁlm of lubricant between the sliding and rolling surfaces 2To help distribute and dissipate heat 3To prevent corrosion of the bearing surfaces 4To protect the parts from the entrance of foreign matter Either oil or grease may be employed as a lubricant. The following rules may help in deciding between them. 11–12 Mounting and Enclosure There are so many methods of mounting antifriction bearings that each new design is a real challenge to the ingenuity of the designer. The housing bore and shaft out- side diameter must be held to very close limits, which of course is expensive. There are usually one or more counterboring operations, several facing operations and drilling, tapping, and threading operations, all of which must be performed on the shaft, housing, or cover plate. Each of these operations contributes to the cost of pro- duction, so that the designer, in ferreting out a trouble-free and low-cost mounting, is faced with a difﬁcult and important problem. The various bearing manufacturers’ handbooks give many mounting details in almost every design area. In a text of this nature, however, it is possible to give only the barest details. The most frequently encountered mounting problem is that which requires one bearing at each end of a shaft. Such a design might use one ball bearing at each end, one tapered roller bearing at each end, or a ball bearing at one end and a straight roller bearing at the other. One of the bearings usually has the added function ofUse Grease When Use Oil When The temperature is not over 200°F. The speed is low. Unusual protection is required from the entrance of foreign matter. Simple bearing enclosures are desired. Operation for long periods without attention is desired.1. Speeds are high. Temperatures are high. Oiltight seals are readily employed. Bearing type is not suitable for grease lubrication. The bearing is lubricated from a central supply which is also used for other machine parts. 2R. L. Leibensperger, “When Selecting a Bearing,” Machine Design, vol. 47, no. 8, April 3, 1975, pp. 142–147.bud29281_ch11_569-616.qxd 12/16/09 9:02 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Rolling-Contact Bearings 605 positioning or axially locating the shaft. Figure 11–20 shows a very common solution to this problem. The inner rings are backed up against the shaft shoulders and are held in position by round nuts threaded onto the shaft. The outer ring of the left-hand bearing is backed up against a housing shoulder and is held in position by a device that is not shown. The outer ring of the right-hand bearing ﬂoats in the housing. There are many variations possible on the method shown in Fig. 11–20. For exam- ple, the function of the shaft shoulder may be performed by retaining rings, by the hub of a gear or pulley, or by spacing tubes or rings. The round nuts may be replaced by retaining rings or by washers locked in position by screws, cotters, or taper pins. The housing shoulder may be replaced by a retaining ring; the outer ring of the bear- ing may be grooved for a retaining ring, or a ﬂanged outer ring may be used. The force against the outer ring of the left-hand bearing is usually applied by the cover plate, but if no thrust is present, the ring may be held in place by retaining rings. Figure 11–21 shows an alternative method of mounting in which the inner races are backed up against the shaft shoulders as before but no retaining devices are required. With this method the outer races are completely retained. This eliminates the grooves or threads, which cause stress concentration on the overhanging end, but it requires accu- rate dimensions in an axial direction or the employment of adjusting means. This method has the disadvantage that if the distance between the bearings is great, the temperature rise during operation may expand the shaft enough to destroy the bearings. It is frequently necessary to use two or more bearings at one end of a shaft. For example, two bearings could be used to obtain additional rigidity or increased load capacity or to cantilever a shaft. Several two-bearing mountings are shown in Fig. 11–22. These may be used with tapered roller bearings, as shown, or with ball bearings. In either case it should be noted that the effect of the mounting is to preload the bear- ings in an axial direction.Figure 11–20 A common bearing mounting. Figure 11–21 An alternative bearing mounting to that in Fig. 11–20. bud29281_ch11_569-616.qxd 12/16/09 9:02 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:606 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 11–23 shows another two-bearing mounting. Note the use of washers against the cone backs. When maximum stiffness and resistance to shaft misalignment is desired, pairs of angular-contact ball bearings (Fig. 11–2) are often used in an arrangement called duplexing . Bearings manufactured for duplex mounting have their rings ground with an offset, so that when a pair of bearings is tightly clamped together, a preload is automatically established. As shown in Fig. 11–24, three mounting arrangements are used. The face-to-face mounting, called DF, will take heavy radial loads and thrust loads from either direction. The DB mounting (back to back) has the greatest align- ing stiffness and is also good for heavy radial loads and thrust loads from either direc- tion. The tandem arrangement, called the DT mounting, is used where the thrust is always in the same direction; since the two bearings have their thrust functions in the same direction, a preload, if required, must be obtained in some other manner. Bearings are usually mounted with the rotating ring a press ﬁt, whether it be the inner or outer ring. The stationary ring is then mounted with a push ﬁt. This permits the stationary ring to creep in its mounting slightly, bringing new portions of the ring into the load-bearing zone to equalize wear.(a)( b)Figure 11–22 Two-bearing mountings.

Figure 11–25 shows a typical bearing in which the clearance is exaggerated for clarity. Preloading of straight roller bearings may be obtained by: 1Mounting the bearing on a tapered shaft or sleeve to expand the inner ring 2Using an interference ﬁt for the outer ring 3Purchasing a bearing with the outer ring preshrunk over the rollers Ball bearings are usually preloaded by the axial load built in during assembly. However, the bearings of Fig. 11–24 aand bare preloaded in assembly because of the differences in widths of the inner and outer rings. It is always good practice to follow manufacturers’ recommendations in deter- mining preload, since too much will lead to early failure. Alignment The permissible misalignment in bearings depends on the type of bearing and the geo- metric and material properties of the speciﬁc bearing. Manufacturers’ catalogs should be referenced for detailed speciﬁcations on a given bearing. In general, cylindrical and tapered roller bearings require alignments that are closer than deep-groove ball bearings. Spherical ball bearings and self-aligning bearings are the most forgiving. Table 7–2, p. 379, gives typical maximum ranges for each type of bearing. The life of the bearing decreases signiﬁcantly when the misalignment exceeds the allowable limits. Additional protection against misalignment is obtained by providing the full shoulders (see Fig. 11–8) recommended by the manufacturer. Also, if there is any mis- alignment at all, it is good practice to provide a safety factor of around 2 to account for possible increases during assembly. Enclosures To exclude dirt and foreign matter and to retain the lubricant, the bearing mountings must include a seal. The three principal methods of sealings are the felt seal, the com- mercial seal, and the labyrinth seal (Fig. 11–26). Felt seals may be used with grease lubrication when the speeds are low. The rub- bing surfaces should have a high polish. Felt seals should be protected from dirt by placing them in machined grooves or by using metal stampings as shields. The commercial seal is an assembly consisting of the rubbing element and, gen- erally, a spring backing, which are retained in a sheet-metal jacket. These seals are usually made by press ﬁtting them into a counterbored hole in the bearing cover. Since they obtain the sealing action by rubbing, they should not be used for high speeds.Clearance Figure 11–25 Clearance in an off-the-shelf bearing, exaggerated for clarity.

It is sometimes used with ﬂingers. At least three grooves should be used, and they may be cut on either the bore or the outside diameter. The clearance may vary from 0.010 to 0.040 in, depending upon the speed and temperature. PROBLEMS Problems marked with an asterisk (*) are linked to problems in other chapters, as summarized in Table 1–1 of Sec. 1–16, p. 24. Since each bearing manufacturer makes individual decisions with respect to materials, treatments, and manufacturing processes, manufacturers’ experiences with bearing life distrib- ution differ. In solving the following problems, we will use the experience of two manufacturers, tabulated as follows: Tables 11–2 and 11–3 are based on manufacturer 2. 11–1 A certain application requires a ball bearing with the inner ring rotating, with a design life of 25 kh at a speed of 350 rev/min. The radial load is 2.5 kN and an application factor of 1.2 is appropriate. The reliability goal is 0.90. Find the multiple of rating life required, xD, and the catalog rating C10with which to enter a bearing table. Choose a 02-series deep-groove ball bearing from Table 11–2, and estimate the reliability in use. 11–2 An angular-contact, inner ring rotating, 02-series ball bearing is required for an application in which the life requirement is 40 kh at 520 rev/min. The design radial load is 725 lbf. The appli- cation factor is 1.4. The reliability goal is 0.90. Find the multiple of rating life xDrequired and the catalog rating C10with which to enter Table 11–2. Choose a bearing and estimate the exist- ing reliability in service. 11–3 The other bearing on the shaft of Prob. 11–2 is to be a 03-series cylindrical roller bearing with inner ring rotating. For a 2235-lbf radial load, ﬁnd the catalog rating C10with which to enter Table 11–3. The reliability goal is 0.90. Choose a bearing and estimate its reliability in use. 11–4 Problems 11–2 and 11–3 raise the question of the reliability of the bearing pair on the shaft. Since the combined reliabilities Ris R1R2, what is the reliability of the two bearings (proba- bility that either or both will not fail) as a result of your decisions in Probs. 11–2 and 11–3? What does this mean in setting reliability goals for each of the bearings of the pair on the shaft? 11–5 Combine Probs. 11–2 and 11–3 for an overall reliability of R=0.90. Reconsider your selec- tions, and meet this overall reliability goal. 11–6 A straight (cylindrical) roller bearing is subjected to a radial load of 20 kN. The life is to be 8000 h at a speed of 950 rev/min and exhibit a reliability of 0.95. What basic load rating should be used in selecting the bearing from a catalog of manufacturer 2? 11–7 Two ball bearings from different manufacturers are being considered for a certain application.

A lubricant is any substance that, when inserted between the moving surfaces, accomplishes these purposes. In a sleeve bearing, a shaft, or jour- nal,rotates or oscillates within a sleeve, or bushing, and the relative motion is sliding. In an antifriction bearing, the main relative motion is rolling. A follower may either roll or slide on the cam. Gear teeth mate with each other by a combination of rolling and sliding. Pistons slide within their cylinders. All these applications require lubrication to reduce friction, wear, and heating. The ﬁeld of application for journal bearings is immense. The crankshaft and connecting-rod bearings of an automotive engine must operate for thousands of miles at high temperatures and under varying load conditions. The journal bearings used in the steam turbines of power-generating stations are said to have reliabilities approaching 100 percent. At the other extreme there are thousands of applications in which the loads are light and the service relatively unimportant; a simple, easily installed bearing is required, using little or no lubrication. In such cases an antifriction bearing might be a poor answer because of the cost, the elaborate enclosures, the close tolerances, the radial space required, the high speeds, or the increased inertial effects. Instead, a nylon bearing requiring no lubrication, a powder-metallurgy bearing with the lubrication “built in,” or a bronze bearing with ring oiling, wick feeding, or solid-lubricant ﬁlm or grease lubri- cation might be a very satisfactory solution. Recent metallurgy developments in bearing materials, combined with increased knowledge of the lubrication process, now make it possible to design journal bearings with satisfactory lives and very good reliabilities. Much of the material we have studied thus far in this book has been based on fun- damental engineering studies, such as statics, dynamics, the mechanics of solids, metal processing, mathematics, and metallurgy. In the study of lubrication and journal bear- ings, additional fundamental studies, such as chemistry, ﬂuid mechanics, thermody- namics, and heat transfer, must be utilized in developing the material. While we shall not utilize all of them in the material to be included here, you can now begin to appre- ciate better how the study of mechanical engineering design is really an integration of most of your previous studies and a directing of this total background toward the resolution of a single objective. 12–1 Types of Lubrication Five distinct forms of lubrication may be identiﬁed: 1Hydrodynamic 2Hydrostatic 3Elastohydrodynamic 4Boundary 5Solid ﬁlm Hydrodynamic lubrication means that the load-carrying surfaces of the bearing are separated by a relatively thick ﬁlm of lubricant, so as to prevent metal-to-metal contact, and that the stability thus obtained can be explained by the laws of ﬂuid mechanics. Hydrodynamic lubrication does not depend upon the introduction of the lubricant under pressure, though that may occur; but it does require the existence of an adequate sup- ply at all times. The ﬁlm pressure is created by the moving surface itself pulling the lubricant into a wedge-shaped zone at a velocity sufﬁciently high to create the pressure necessary to separate the surfaces against the load on the bearing. Hydrodynamic lubri- cation is also called full-ﬁlm, or ﬂuid, lubrication .bud29281_ch12_617-672.qxd 12/16/09 9:51 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Lubrication and Journal Bearings 619 Figure 12–1 F uh yU AHydrostatic lubrication is obtained by introducing the lubricant, which is some- times air or water, into the load-bearing area at a pressure high enough to separate the surfaces with a relatively thick ﬁlm of lubricant. So, unlike hydrodynamic lubrication, this kind of lubrication does not require motion of one surface relative to another. We shall not deal with hydrostatic lubrication in this book, but the subject should be con- sidered in designing bearings where the velocities are small or zero and where the frictional resistance is to be an absolute minimum. Elastohydrodynamic lubrication is the phenomenon that occurs when a lubricant is introduced between surfaces that are in rolling contact, such as mating gears or rolling bearings. The mathematical explanation requires the Hertzian theory of contact stress and ﬂuid mechanics. Insufﬁcient surface area, a drop in the velocity of the moving surface, a lessening in the quantity of lubricant delivered to a bearing, an increase in the bearing load, or an increase in lubricant temperature resulting in a decrease in viscosity—any one of these—may prevent the buildup of a ﬁlm thick enough for full-ﬁlm lubrication. When this happens, the highest asperities may be separated by lubricant ﬁlms only several molecular dimensions in thickness. This is called boundary lubrication . The change from hydrodynamic to boundary lubrication is not at all a sudden or abrupt one. It is probable that a mixed hydrodynamic- and boundary-type lubrication occurs ﬁrst, and as the surfaces move closer together, the boundary-type lubrication becomes predominant. The viscosity of the lubricant is not of as much importance with boundary lubrication as is the chemical composition. When bearings must be operated at extreme temperatures, a solid-ﬁlm lubricant such as graphite or molybdenum disulﬁde must be used because the ordinary mineral oils are not satisfactory. Much research is currently being carried out in an effort, too, to ﬁnd composite bearing materials with low wear rates as well as small frictional coefﬁcients. 12–2 Viscosity In Fig. 12–1 let plate Abe moving with a velocity Uon a ﬁlm of lubricant of thickness h. We imagine the ﬁlm as composed of a series of horizontal layers and the force Fcausing these layers to deform or slide on one another just like a deck of cards. The layers in con- tact with the moving plate are assumed to have a velocity U; those in contact with the stationary surface are assumed to have a zero velocity. Intermediate layers have velocities that depend upon their distances yfrom the stationary surface. Newton’s viscous effect states that the shear stress in the ﬂuid is proportional to the rate of change of velocity with respect to y. Thus τ=F A=μdu dy(12–1)bud29281_ch12_617-672.qxd 12/16/09 9:51 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:620 Mechanical Engineering Design where μis the constant of proportionality and deﬁnes absolute viscosity, also called dynamic viscosity . The derivative du/dyis the rate of change of velocity with distance and may be called the rate of shear, or the velocity gradient. The viscosity μis thus a measure of the internal frictional resistance of the ﬂuid. For most lubricating ﬂuids, the rate of shear is constant, and du/dy=U/h. Thus, from Eq. (12–1), τ=F A=μU h(12–2) Fluids exhibiting this characteristic are said to be Newtonian ﬂuids. The unit of vis- cosity in the ips system is seen to be the pound-force-second per square inch; this is the same as stress or pressure multiplied by time. The ips unit is called the reyn, in honor of Sir Osborne Reynolds. The absolute viscosity is measured by the pascal-second ( Pa·s) in SI; this is the same as a Newton-second per square meter. The conversion from ips units to SI is the same as for stress. For example, multiply the absolute viscosity in reyns by 6890 to convert to units of Pa·s. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has published a list of cgs units that are not to be used in ASME documents.1This list results from a recom- mendation by the International Committee of Weights and Measures (CIPM) that the use of cgs units with special names be discouraged. Included in this list is a unit of force called the dyne (dyn), a unit of dynamic viscosity called the poise (P), and a unit of kinematic viscosity called the stoke (St). All of these units have been, and still are, used extensively in lubrication studies. The poise is the cgs unit of dynamic or absolute viscosity, and its unit is the dyne- second per square centimeter ( dyn·s/cm2). It has been customary to use the centipoise (cP) in analysis, because its value is more convenient. When the viscosity is expressed in centipoises, it is designated by Z. The conversion from cgs units to SI and ips units is as follows: μ(Pa·s)=(10)−3Z(cP) μ(reyn)=Z(cP) 6.89(10)6 μ(mPa·s)=6.89μ/prime(μreyn) In using ips units, the microreyn ( μreyn) is often more convenient. The symbol μ/primewill be used to designate viscosity in μreyn such that μ=μ/prime/(106). The ASTM standard method for determining viscosity uses an instrument called the Saybolt Universal Viscosimeter. The method consists of measuring the time in seconds for 60 mL of lubricant at a speciﬁed temperature to run through a tube 17.6 mm in diameter and 12.25 mm long. The result is called the kinematic viscosity, and in the past the unit of the square centimeter per second has been used. One square centimeter per sec- ond is deﬁned as a stoke . By the use of the Hagen-Poiseuille law, the kinematic viscosity based upon seconds Saybolt, also called Saybolt Universal viscosity (SUV) in seconds, is Zk=/parenleftbigg 0.22t−180 t/parenrightbigg (12–3) where Zkis in centistokes (cSt) and tis the number of seconds Saybolt. 1ASME Orientation and Guide for Use of Metric Units, 2nd ed., American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 1972, p. 13.bud29281_ch12_617-672.qxd 12/16/09 9:51 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Lubrication and Journal Bearings 621 Figure 12–2 A comparison of the viscosities of various ﬂuids.

Figure 12–2 shows the absolute viscosity in the ips system of a number of ﬂuids often used for lubrication purposes and their variation with temperature. 12–3 Petroff’s Equation The phenomenon of bearing friction was ﬁrst explained by Petroff on the assumption that the shaft is concentric. Though we shall seldom make use of Petroff’s method of analysis in the material to follow, it is important because it deﬁnes groups of dimen- sionless parameters and because the coefﬁcient of friction predicted by this law turns out to be quite good even when the shaft is not concentric. Let us now consider a vertical shaft rotating in a guide bearing. It is assumed that the bearing carries a very small load, that the clearance space is completely ﬁlled with oil, and that leakage is negligible (Fig. 12–3). We denote the radius of the shaft by r,bud29281_ch12_617-672.qxd 12/16/09 9:51 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:622 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 12–3 Petroff’s lightly loaded journal bearing consisting of a shaft journal and a bushing with an axial-groove internal lubricant reservoir.

If the shaft rotates at Nrev/s , then its surface velocity is U=2πrNin/s. Since the shearing stress in the lubricant is equal to the velocity gradient times the viscosity, from Eq. (12–2) we have τ=μU h=2πrμN c(a) where the radial clearance chas been substituted for the distance h. The force required to shear the ﬁlm is the stress times the area. The torque is the force times the lever arm r. Thus T=(τA)(r)=/parenleftbigg2πrμN c/parenrightbigg (2πrl)(r)=4π2r3lμN c(b) If we now designate a small force on the bearing by W, in pounds-force, then the pres- sure P, in pounds-force per square inch of projected area, is P=W/2rl. The frictional force is fW, where fis the coefﬁcient of friction, and so the frictional torque is T=fW r=(f)(2rlP)(r)=2r2flP (c) Substituting the value of the torque from Eq. ( c) in Eq. ( b) and solving for the coefﬁ- cient of friction, we ﬁnd f=2π2μN Pr c(12–6) Equation (12–6) is called Petroff’s equation and was ﬁrst published in 1883. The two quantities μN/Pandr/care very important parameters in lubrication. Substitution of the appropriate dimensions in each parameter will show that they are dimensionless. The bearing characteristic number, or the Sommerfeld number, is deﬁned by the equation S=/parenleftbiggr c/parenrightbigg2μN P(12–7) The Sommerfeld number is very important in lubrication analysis because it contains many of the parameters that are speciﬁed by the designer. Note that it is also dimen- sionless. The quantity r/cis called the radial clearance ratio . If we multiply both sidesbud29281_ch12_617-672.qxd 12/16/09 9:51 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Lubrication and Journal Bearings 623 of Eq. (12–6) by this ratio, we obtain the interesting relation fr c=2π2μN P/parenleftbiggr c/parenrightbigg2 =2π2S (12–8) 12–4 Stable Lubrication The difference between boundary and hydrodynamic lubrication can be explained by reference to Fig. 12–4. This plot of the change in the coefﬁcient of friction versus the bearing characteristic μN/Pwas obtained by the McKee brothers in an actual test of friction.2The plot is important because it deﬁnes stability of lubrication and helps us to understand hydrodynamic and boundary, or thin-ﬁlm, lubrication. Recall Petroff’s bearing model in the form of Eq. (12–6) predicts that fis pro- portional to μN/P, that is, a straight line from the origin in the ﬁrst quadrant. On the coordinates of Fig. 12–4 the locus to the right of point Cis an example. Petroff’s model presumes thick-ﬁlm lubrication, that is, no metal-to-metal contact, the surfaces being completely separated by a lubricant ﬁlm. The McKee abscissa was ZN/P(centipoise ×rev/min/psi) and the value of abscissa Bin Fig. 12–4 was 30. The corresponding μN/P(reyn ×rev/s/psi) is 0.33( 10−6). Designers keep μN/P≥1.7(10−6), which corresponds to ZN/P≥150. A design constraint to keep thick-ﬁlm lubrication is to be sure that μN P≥1.7(10−6) (a) Suppose we are operating to the right of line BAand something happens, say, an increase in lubricant temperature. This results in a lower viscosity and hence a smaller value of μN/P.The coefﬁcient of friction decreases, not as much heat is generated in shearing the lubricant, and consequently the lubricant temperature drops. Thus the region to the right of line BAdeﬁnes stable lubrication because variations are self-correcting. To the left of line BA, a decrease in viscosity would increase the friction. A temperature rise would ensue, and the viscosity would be reduced still more. The result would be compounded. Thus the region to the left of line BArepresents unstable lubrication . It is also helpful to see that a small viscosity, and hence a small μN/P,means that the lubricant ﬁlm is very thin and that there will be a greater possibility of some Figure 12–4 The variation of the coefﬁcient of friction fwith μN/H20862P.

Figure 12–5 a shows a journal that is just beginning to rotate in a clockwise direction. Under starting conditions, the bearing will be dry, or at least partly dry, and hence the journal will climb or roll up the right side of the bearing as shown in Fig. 12–5 a. Now suppose a lubricant is introduced into the top of the bearing as shown in Fig. 12–5 b. The action of the rotating journal is to pump the lubricant around the bear- ing in a clockwise direction. The lubricant is pumped into a wedge-shaped space and forces the journal over to the other side. A minimum ﬁlm thickness h0occurs, not at the bottom of the journal, but displaced clockwise from the bottom as in Fig. 12–5 b. This is explained by the fact that a ﬁlm pressure in the converging half of the ﬁlm reaches a maximum somewhere to the left of the bearing center. Figure 12–5 shows how to decide whether the journal, under hydrodynamic lubrica- tion, is eccentrically located on the right or on the left side of the bearing.Visualize the jour- nal beginning to rotate. Find the side of the bearing upon which the journal tends to roll. Then, if the lubrication is hydrodynamic, mentally place the journal on the opposite side. The nomenclature of a journal bearing is shown in Fig. 12–6. The dimension cis the radial clearance and is the difference in the radii of the bushing and journal.

The dis- tance between these centers is the eccentricity and is denoted by e. The minimum ﬁlm thickness is designated by h0, and it occurs at the line of centers. The ﬁlm thickness at any other point is designated by h. We also deﬁne an eccentricity ratio /epsilon1as /epsilon1=e c The bearing shown in the ﬁgure is known as a partial bearing . If the radius of the bushing is the same as the radius of the journal, it is known as a ﬁtted bearing . If the bushing encloses the journal, as indicated by the dashed lines, it becomes a full bearing . The angle βdescribes the angular length of a partial bearing. For example, a 120◦partial bearing has the angle βequal to 120◦. 12–6 Hydrodynamic Theory The present theory of hydrodynamic lubrication originated in the laboratory of Beauchamp Tower in the early 1880s in England. Tower had been employed to study the friction in railroad journal bearings and learn the best methods of lubricating them. It was an accident or error, during the course of this investigation, that prompted Tower to look at the problem in more detail and that resulted in a discovery that eventually led to the development of the theory. Figure 12–7 is a schematic drawing of the journal bearing that Tower investigated. It is a partial bearing, having a diameter of 4 in, a length of 6 in, and a bearing arc of 157◦, and having bath-type lubrication, as shown. The coefﬁcients of friction obtained by Tower in his investigations on this bearing were quite low, which is now not surprising. After testing this bearing, Tower later drilled a 1 2-in-diameter lubricator hole through the top. But when the apparatus was set in motion, oil ﬂowed out of this hole. In an effort to prevent this, a cork stopper was used, but this popped out, and so it was necessary to drive a wooden plug into the hole. When the wooden plug was pushed out too, Tower, at this point, undoubtedly realized that he was on the verge of discovery. A pressure gauge connected to the hole indicated a pressure of more than twice the unit bearing load. Finally, he investigated the bearing ﬁlm pressures in detail throughout the bearing width and length and reported a distribution similar to that of Fig. 12–8.3 The results obtained by Tower had such regularity that Osborne Reynolds con- cluded that there must be a deﬁnite equation relating the friction, the pressure, and the Figure 12–7 Schematic representation of the partial bearing used by Tower.

The present mathematical theory of lubrication is based upon Reynolds’ work following the experiment by Tower.4The original differential equation, developed by Reynolds, was used by him to explain Tower’s results. The solution is a challenging problem that has interested many investigators ever since then, and it is still the starting point for lubrication studies. Reynolds pictured the lubricant as adhering to both surfaces and being pulled by the moving surface into a narrowing, wedge-shaped space so as to create a ﬂuid or ﬁlm pressure of sufﬁcient intensity to support the bearing load. One of the important sim- plifying assumptions resulted from Reynolds’ realization that the ﬂuid ﬁlms were so thin in comparison with the bearing radius that the curvature could be neglected. This enabled him to replace the curved partial bearing with a ﬂat bearing, called a plane slider bearing . Other assumptions made were: 1The lubricant obeys Newton’s viscous effect, Eq. (12–1). 2The forces due to the inertia of the lubricant are neglected. 3The lubricant is assumed to be incompressible. 4The viscosity is assumed to be constant throughout the ﬁlm. 5The pressure does not vary in the axial direction. Figure 12–9 ashows a journal rotating in the clockwise direction supported by a film of lubricant of variable thickness hon a partial bearing, which is ﬁxed. We specify that the journal has a constant surface velocity U. Using Reynolds’ assumption that curvature can be neglected, we ﬁx a right-handed xyzreference system to the stationary bearing. We now make the following additional assumptions: 6The bushing and journal extend inﬁnitely in the zdirection; this means there can be no lubricant ﬂow in the zdirection. 7The ﬁlm pressure is constant in the ydirection. Thus the pressure depends only on the coordinate x. 8The velocity of any particle of lubricant in the ﬁlm depends only on the co- ordinates xand y. We now select an element of lubricant in the ﬁlm (Fig. 12–9 a) of dimensions dx, dy, and dz, and compute the forces that act on the sides of this element. As shown in Fig. 12–9 b, normal forces, due to the pressure, act upon the right and left sides of the 4Osborne Reynolds, “Theory of Lubrication, Part I,” Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.

This gives ∂u ∂y=1 μdp dxy+C1 u=1 2μdp dxy2+C1y+C2(e) Note that the act of holding xconstant means that C1and C2can be functions of x. We now assume that there is no slip between the lubricant and the boundary surfaces. This gives two sets of boundary conditions for evaluating the constants C1and C2: At y=0,u=0 At y=h,u=U(f)Figure 12–9bud29281_ch12_617-672.qxd 12/16/09 9:51 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:628 Mechanical Engineering Design Notice, in the second condition, that his a function of x.

The equation shows that the velocity distribution across the ﬁlm (from y=0to y=h) is obtained by superposing a para- bolic distribution onto a linear distribution. Figure 12–10 shows the superposition of these distributions to obtain the velocity for particular values of xanddp/dx. In general, the parabolic term may be additive or subtractive to the linear term, depending upon the sign of the pressure gradient. When the pressure is maximum, dp/dx=0and the velocity is u=U hy (g) which is a linear relation. We next deﬁne Qas the volume of lubricant ﬂowing in the xdirection per unit time. By using a width of unity in the zdirection, the volume may be obtained by the expression Q=/integraldisplayh 0ud y (h) Substituting the value of ufrom Eq.

In the ﬁrst group are those whose values either are given or are under the control of the designer. These are: 1The viscosity μ 2The load per unit of projected bearing area, P 3The speed N 4The bearing dimensions r, c, β, and l Of these four variables, the designer usually has no control over the speed, because it is speciﬁed by the overall design of the machine. Sometimes the viscosity is speciﬁed in advance, as, for example, when the oil is stored in a sump and is used for lubricating and cooling a variety of bearings. The remaining variables, and sometimes the viscosity, may be controlled by the designer and are therefore the decisions the designer makes. In other words, when these four decisions are made, the design is complete. In the second group are the dependent variables. The designer cannot control these except indirectly by changing one or more of the ﬁrst group. These are: 1The coefﬁcient of friction f 2The temperature rise /Delta1T 3The volume ﬂow rate of oil Q 4The minimum ﬁlm thickness h0 5A.

Certain limitations on their values must be imposed by the designer to ensure satisfactory performance. These limitations are speciﬁed by the char- acteristics of the bearing materials and of the lubricant. The fundamental problem in bear- ing design, therefore, is to deﬁne satisfactory limits for the second group of variables and then to decide upon values for the ﬁrst group such that these limitations are not exceeded. Signiﬁcant Angular Speed In the next section we will examine several important charts relating key variables to the Sommerfeld number. To this point we have assumed that only the journal rotates and it is the journal rotational speed that is used in the Sommerfeld number. It has been discovered that the angular speed Nthat is signiﬁcant to hydrodynamic ﬁlm bearing performance is6 N=|Nj+Nb−2Nf| (12–13) where Nj=journal angular speed, rev/s Nb=bearing angular speed, rev/s Nf=load vector angular speed, rev/s When determining the Sommerfeld number for a general bearing, use Eq. (12–13) when entering N. Figure 12–11 shows several situations for determining N. Trumpler’s Design Criteria for Journal Bearings Because the bearing assembly creates the lubricant pressure to carry a load, it reacts to loading by changing its eccentricity, which reduces the minimum ﬁlm thickness h0until the load is carried. What is the limit of smallness of h0? Close examination reveals that the moving adjacent surfaces of the journal and bushing are not smooth but consist of a series of asperities that pass one another, separated by a lubricant ﬁlm. In starting a 6Paul Robert Trumpler, Design of Film Bearings, Macmillan, New York, 1966, pp. 103–119.bud29281_ch12_617-672.qxd 12/16/09 9:51 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Lubrication and Journal Bearings 631 bearing under load from rest there is metal-to-metal contact and surface asperities are broken off, free to move and circulate with the oil. Unless a ﬁlter is provided, this debris accumulates. Such particles have to be free to tumble at the section containing the min- imum ﬁlm thickness without snagging in a togglelike conﬁguration, creating additional damage and debris. Trumpler, an accomplished bearing designer, provides a throat of at least 200 μin to pass particles from ground surfaces.7He also provides for the inﬂuence of size (tolerances tend to increase with size) by stipulating h0≥0.0002+0.000 04 din (a) where dis the journal diameter in inches. A lubricant is a mixture of hydrocarbons that reacts to increasing temperature by vaporizing the lighter components, leaving behind the heavier. This process (bearings have lots of time) slowly increases the viscosity of the remaining lubricant, which increases heat generation rate and elevates lubricant temperatures. This sets the stage for future failure. For light oils, Trumpler limits the maximum ﬁlm temperature Tmaxto Tmax≤250◦F (b) Some oils can operate at slightly higher temperatures. Always check with the lubricant manufacturer. A journal bearing often consists of a ground steel journal working against a softer, usually nonferrous, bushing. In starting under load there is metal-to-metal contact, abrasion, and the generation of wear particles, which, over time, can change the geo- metry of the bushing. The starting load divided by the projected area is limited to Wst lD≤300 psi (c) If the load on a journal bearing is suddenly increased, the increase in ﬁlm temper- ature in the annulus is immediate. Since ground vibration due to passing trucks, trains, and earth tremors is often present, Trumpler used a design factor of 2 or more on the running load, but not on the starting load of Eq. ( c): nd≥2 (d) Many of Trumpler’s designs are operating today, long after his consulting career is over; clearly they constitute good advice to the beginning designer. 12–8 The Relations of the Variables Before proceeding to the problem of design, it is necessary to establish the relationships between the variables. Albert A. Raimondi and John Boyd, of Westinghouse Research Laboratories, used an iteration technique to solve Reynolds’ equation on the digital computer.8This is the ﬁrst time such extensive data have been available for use by designers, and consequently we shall employ them in this book.9 7Op. cit., pp. 192–194. 8A.

ASLE, vol. 1, no. 1, in Lubrication Science and Technology, Pergamon, New York, 1958, pp. 159–209. 9See also the earlier companion paper, John Boyd and Albert A. Raimondi, “Applying Bearing Theory to the Analysis and Design of Journal Bearings, Part I and II,” J. Appl. Mechanics, vol. 73, 1951, pp. 298–316.bud29281_ch12_617-672.qxd 12/16/09 9:51 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:632 Mechanical Engineering Design The Raimondi and Boyd papers were published in three parts and contain 45 detailed charts and 6 tables of numerical information. In all three parts, charts are used to deﬁne the variables for length-diameter (l/d)ratios of 1:4, 1:2, and 1 and for beta angles of 60 to 360◦. Under certain conditions the solution to the Reynolds equation gives negative pressures in the diverging portion of the oil ﬁlm. Since a lubricant can- not usually support a tensile stress, Part III of the Raimondi-Boyd papers assumes that the oil ﬁlm is ruptured when the ﬁlm pressure becomes zero. Part III also contains data for the inﬁnitely long bearing; since it has no ends, this means that there is no side leak- age. The charts appearing in this book are from Part III of the papers, and are for full journal bearings (β=360◦)only. Space does not permit the inclusion of charts for par- tial bearings. This means that you must refer to the charts in the original papers when beta angles of less than 360◦are desired. The notation is very nearly the same as in this book, and so no problems should arise. Viscosity Charts (Figs. 12–12 to 12–14) One of the most important assumptions made in the Raimondi-Boyd analysis is that viscosity of the lubricant is constant as it passes through the bearing . But since work is done on the lubricant during this ﬂow, the temperature of the oil is higher when it leaves the loading zone than it was on entry. And the viscosity charts clearly indicate that the viscosity drops off signiﬁcantly with a rise in temperature. Since the analysis is based on a constant viscosity, our problem now is to determine the value of viscosity to be used in the analysis. Some of the lubricant that enters the bearing emerges as a side ﬂow, which carries away some of the heat. The balance of the lubricant ﬂows through the load-bearing zone and carries away the balance of the heat generated. In determining the viscosity to be used we shall employ a temperature that is the average of the inlet and outlet tempera- tures, or Tav=T1+/Delta1T 2(12–14) where T1is the inlet temperature and /Delta1Tis the temperature rise of the lubricant from inlet to outlet. Of course, the viscosity used in the analysis must correspond toTav. Viscosity varies considerably with temperature in a nonlinear fashion. The ordi- nates in Figs. 12–12 to 12–14 are not logarithmic, as the decades are of differing vertical length. These graphs represent the temperature versus viscosity functions for common grades of lubricating oils in both customary engineering and SI units. We have the temperature versus viscosity function only in graphical form, unless curve ﬁts are devel- oped. See Table 12–1. One of the objectives of lubrication analysis is to determine the oil outlet temper- ature when the oil and its inlet temperature are speciﬁed. This is a trial-and-error type of problem. In an analysis, the temperature rise will ﬁrst be estimated. This allows for the viscosity to be determined from the chart. With the value of the viscosity, the analysis is performed where the temperature rise is then computed. With this, a new estimate of the temperature rise is established. This process is continued until the estimated and computed temperatures agree. To illustrate, suppose we have decided to use SAE 30 oil in an application in which the oil inlet temperature is T1=180◦F. We begin by estimating that the temperature risebud29281_ch12_617-672.qxd 12/16/09 9:51 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Lubrication and Journal Bearings 633 Figure 12–12 Viscosity–temperature chart in U.S. customary units.

So we use this viscosity (in an analysis to be explained in detail later) and ﬁnd that the temperature rise is actually /Delta1T=54◦F. Thus Eq.

(Adapted from Fig. 12–12.) This corresponds to point Aon Fig. 12–12, which is above the SAE 30 line and indi- cates that the viscosity used in the analysis was too high. For a second guess, try μ=1.00μreyn. Again we run through an analysis and this time ﬁnd that /Delta1T=30◦F. This gives an average temperature of Tav=180+30 2=195◦F and locates point Bon Fig. 12–12. If points Aand Bare fairly close to each other and on opposite sides of the SAE 30 line, a straight line can be drawn between them with the intersection locating the cor- rect values of viscosity and average temperature to be used in the analysis.

These variables are Minimum ﬁlm thickness (Figs. 12–16 and 12–17) Coefﬁcient of friction (Fig. 12–18) Lubricant flow (Figs. 12–19 and 12–20) Film pressure (Figs. 12–21 and 12–22) Figure 12–15 shows the notation used for the variables. We will describe the use of these curves in a series of four examples using the same set of given parameters. Minimum Film Thickness In Fig. 12–16, the minimum ﬁlm thickness variable h0/candeccentricity ratio /epsilon1=e/c are plotted against the Sommerfeld number Swith contours for various values of l/d. The corresponding angular position of the minimum ﬁlm thickness is found in Fig. 12–17. EXAMPLE 12–1 Determine h0and eusing the following given parameters: μ=4μreyn, N=30 rev/s, W=500 lbf (bearing load), r=0.75 in, c=0.0015 in, and l=1.5 in. Solution The nominal bearing pressure (in projected area of the journal) is P=W 2rl=500 2(0.75)1.5=222 psi The Sommerfeld number is, from Eq.

The quantity h0/cis called the minimum ﬁlm thicknessbud29281_ch12_617-672.qxd 12/16/09 9:51 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:638 Mechanical Engineering Design variable . Since c=0.0015 in, the minimum ﬁlm thickness h0is h0=0.42(0.0015)=0.000 63 in We can ﬁnd the angular location φof the minimum ﬁlm thickness from the chart of Fig. 12–17. Entering with S=0.135and l/d=1gives φ=53◦. The eccentricity ratio is /epsilon1=e/c=0.58. This means the eccentricity eis e=0.58(0.0015)=0.000 87 in Note that if the journal is centered in the bushing, e=0and h0=c, correspond- ing to a very light (zero) load. Since e=0, /epsilon1=0. As the load is increased the journal displaces downward; the limiting position is reached when h0=0and e=c, that is, when the journal touches the bushing. For this condition the eccentricity ratio is unity. Since h0=c−e, dividing both sides by c, we have h0 c=1−/epsilon1 Design optima are sometimes maximum load, which is a load-carrying character- istic of the bearing, and sometimes minimum parasitic power loss or minimum coefﬁ- cient of friction . Dashed lines appear on Fig. 12–16 for maximum load and minimum coefﬁcient of friction, so you can easily favor one of maximum load or minimum coef- ﬁcient of friction, but not both. The zone between the two dashed-line contours might be considered a desirable location for a design point. Coefﬁcient of Friction The friction chart, Fig. 12–18, has the friction variable (r/c)fplotted against Sommerfeld number Swith contours for various values of the l/dratio. EXAMPLE 12–2 Using the parameters given in Ex. 12–1, determine the coefﬁcient of friction, the torque to overcome friction, and the power loss to friction.

The leakage forms a ﬁllet at the journal-bushing exter- nal junction, and it is carried by journal motion to the top of the bushing, where the internal pressure is below atmospheric pressure and the gap is much larger, to be “sucked in” and returned to the lubricant sump. That portion of side leakage that leaks away from the bearing has to be made up by adding oil to the bearing sump periodically by maintenance personnel. Film Pressure The maximum pressure developed in the ﬁlm can be estimated by ﬁnding the pressure ratio P/pmaxfrom the chart in Fig. 12–21. The locations where the terminating and maximum pressures occur, as deﬁned in Fig 12–15, are determined from Fig. 12–22.

It should be clear that we do not have journal-bearing parametric relations as equations, but in the form of charts. Moreover, the examples were simple because the steady-state equivalent viscosity was given. We will now show how the average ﬁlm temperature (and the corresponding viscosity) is found from energy considerations. Lubricant Temperature Rise The temperature of the lubricant rises until the rate at which work is done by the jour- nal on the ﬁlm through ﬂuid shear is the same as the rate at which heat is transferred to the greater surroundings. The speciﬁc arrangement of the bearing plumbing affects the quantitative relationships. See Fig. 12–23. A lubricant sump (internal or external to the bearing housing) supplies lubricant at sump temperature Tsto the bearing annulus at temperature Ts=T1. The lubricant passes once around the bushing and is delivered at a higher lubricant temperature T1+/Delta1Tto the sump. Some of the lubricant leaks out of the bearing at a mixing-cup temperature of T1+/Delta1T/2and is returned to the sump. The sump may be a keyway-like groove in the bearing cap or a larger chamber up to half the bearing circumference. It can occupy “all” of the bearing cap of a split bearing. In such a bearing the side leakage occurs from the lower portion and is sucked back in, into the ruptured ﬁlm arc. The sump could be well removed from the journal-bushing interface.0 0.01 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 2 4 6 8 100102030405060708090100 0510152025 l⁄d = ∞ 11⁄2 1⁄4 1⁄21⁄4 1 ∞ Bearing characteristic number, S = ( )2 rc/H9262N P/H9258p0 /H9258pmaxTerminating position of film /H9258p0 (deg) Position of maximum film pressure /H9258pmax (deg) Figure 12–22 Chart for ﬁnding the terminating position of the lubricant ﬁlm and the position of maximum ﬁlm pressure.

Bearings in which the warm lubricant stays within the bearing housing will now be addressed. These bearings are called self- contained bearings because the lubricant sump is within the bearing housing and the lubricant is cooled within the housing. These bearings are described as pillow-block or pedestal bearings. They ﬁnd use on fans, blowers, pumps, and motors, for example. Integral to design considerations for these bearings is dissipating heat from the bearing housing to the surroundings at the same rate that enthalpy is being generated within the ﬂuid ﬁlm. In a self-contained bearing the sump can be positioned as a keywaylike cavity in the bushing, the ends of the cavity not penetrating the end planes of the bushing. Film oil exits the annulus at about one-half of the relative peripheral speeds of the journal and bushing and slowly tumbles the sump lubricant, mixing with the sump contents. Since the ﬁlm in the top “half” of the cap has cavitated, it contributes essentially nothing to the support of the load, but it does contribute friction. Bearing caps are in use in which the “keyway” sump is expanded peripherally to encompass the top half of the bearing. This reduces friction for the same load, but the included angle βof the bearing has been reduced to 180◦. Charts for this case were included in the Raimondi and Boyd paper. The heat given up by the bearing housing may be estimated from the equation Hloss=¯hCRA(Tb−T∞) (12–17) where Hloss=heat dissipated, Btu/h ¯hCR=combined overall coefﬁcient of radiation and convection heat transfer, Btu/(h ·ft2·◦F) A=surface area of bearing housing, ft2 Tb=surface temperature of the housing, ◦F T∞=ambient temperature, ◦F The overall coefﬁcient ¯hCRdepends on the material, surface coating, geometry, even the roughness, the temperature difference between the housing and surrounding objects, and air velocity. After Karelitz,10and others, in ordinary industrial environments, the overall coefﬁcient ¯hCRcan be treated as a constant. Some representative values are ¯hCR=⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩2 Btu/(h·ft2·◦F) for still air 2.7 Btu/(h·ft2·◦F) for shaft-stirred air 5.9 Btu/(h·ft2·◦F) for air moving at 500 ft/min(12–18) An expression similar to Eq. (12–17) can be written for the temperature difference Tf−Tbbetween the lubricant ﬁlm and the housing surface. This is possible because the bushing and housing are metal and very nearly isothermal. If one deﬁnes ¯Tfas theaverage ﬁlm temperature (halfway between the lubricant inlet temperature Tsand 10G. B. Karelitz, “Heat Dissipation in Self-Contained Bearings,” Trans.

Equation ( a) may be used to estimate the bearing housing temperature. Table 12–2 provides some guidance concerning suit- able values of α. The work of Karelitz allows the broadening of the application of the charts of Raimondi and Boyd, to be applied to a variety of bearings beyond the natural circulation pillow-block bearing. Solving Eq. ( a) for Tband substituting into Eq. (12–17) gives the bearing heat loss rate to the surroundings as Hloss=¯hCRA 1+α(¯Tf−T∞) (12–19 a) and rewriting Eq. ( a) gives Tb=¯Tf+αT∞ 1+α(12–19 b) In beginning a steady-state analysis the average ﬁlm temperature is unknown, hence the viscosity of the lubricant in a self-contained bearing is unknown. Finding the equilibrium temperatures is an iterative process wherein a trial average ﬁlm temperature (and the corresponding viscosity) is used to compare the heat generation rate and the heat loss rate. An adjustment is made to bring these two heat rates into agreement. This can be done on paper with a tabular array to help adjust ¯Tfto achieve equality between heat generation and loss rates. A root-ﬁnding algorithm can be used. Even a simple one can be programmed for a digital computer. Because of the shearing action there is a uniformly distributed energy release in the lubricant that heats the lubricant as it works its way around the bearing. The tempera- ture is uniform in the radial direction but increases from the sump temperature Tsby an amount /Delta1Tduring the lubricant pass. The exiting lubricant mixes with the sump contents, being cooled to sump temperature. The lubricant in the sump is cooled because the bushing and housing metal are at a nearly uniform lower temperature because of heat losses by convection and radiation to the surroundings at ambient tem- perature T∞. In the usual conﬁgurations of such bearings, the bushing and housing metal temperature is approximately midway between the average ﬁlm temperature ¯Tf=Ts+/Delta1T/2and the ambient temperature T∞. The heat generation rate Hgen,a t steady state, is equal to the work rate from the frictional torque T. Expressing this in Btu/h requires the conversion constants 2545 Btu/(hp·h)and 1050 ( lbf·in)(rev/s)/hp results in Hgen=2545 TN/1050 . Then from Eq.

A poor selec- tion of these or inadequate control of them during manufacture or in use may result in a ﬁlm that is too thin, so that the oil ﬂow is insufﬁcient, causing the bearing to overheat and, eventually, fail. Furthermore, the radial clearance cis difﬁcult to hold accurate dur- ing manufacture, and it may increase because of wear. What is the effect of an entire range of radial clearances, expected in manufacture, and what will happen to the bear- ing performance if cincreases because of wear? Most of these questions can be answered and the design optimized by plotting curves of the performance as functions of the quantities over which the designer has control. Figure 12–25 shows the results obtained when the performance of a particular bear- ing is calculated for a whole range of radial clearances and is plotted with clearance as the independent variable. The bearing used for this graph is the one of Examples 12–1 to 12–4 with SAE 20 oil at an inlet temperature of 100◦F. The graph shows that if the clearance is too tight, the temperature will be too high and the minimum ﬁlm thick- ness too low. High temperatures may cause the bearing to fail by fatigue. If the oil ﬁlm is too thin, dirt particles may be unable to pass without scoring or may embed them- selves in the bearing. In either event, there will be excessive wear and friction, result- ing in high temperatures and possible seizing. To investigate the problem in more detail, Table 12–3 was prepared using the two types of preferred running ﬁts that seem to be most useful for journal-bearing designbud29281_ch12_617-672.qxd 12/16/09 9:51 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Lubrication and Journal Bearings 649 Table 12–3 Maximum, Minimum, and Average Clearances for 1.5-in-Diameter Journal Bearings Based on Type of FitClearance c, in Type of Fit Symbol Maximum Average Minimum Close-running H8 /f7 0.001 75 0.001 125 0.000 5 Free-running H9 /d9 0.003 95 0.002 75 0.001 55 Table 12–4 Performance of 1.5-in-Diameter Journal Bearing with Various Clearances.

The results shown in Table 12–3 were obtained by using Eqs. (7–36) and (7–37) of Sec. 7–8. Notice that there is a slight overlap, but the range of clearances for the free-running ﬁt is about twice that of the close-running ﬁt. The six clearances of Table 12–3 were used in a computer program to obtain the numerical results shown in Table 12–4. These conform to the results of Fig. 12–25, too. Both the table and the ﬁgure show that a tight clearance results in a high temperature. Figure 12–26 can be used to estimate an upper temperature limit when the characteris- tics of the application are known. It would seem that a large clearance will permit the dirt particles to pass through and also will permit a large ﬂow of oil, as indicated in Table 12–4. This lowers the tem- perature and increases the life of the bearing. However, if the clearance becomes tooFigure 12–25 A plot of some performance characteristics of the bearing of Exs. 12–1 to 12–4 for radial clearances of 0.0005 to 0.003 in.

In between these two limitations there exists a rather large range of clearances that will result in satisfactory bearing performance. When both the production tolerance and the future wear on the bearing are consid- ered, it is seen, from Fig. 12–25, that the best compromise is a clearance range slightly to the left of the top of the minimum-ﬁlm-thickness curve. In this way, future wear will move the operating point to the right and increase the ﬁlm thickness and decrease the operating temperature. 12–11 Pressure-Fed Bearings The load-carrying capacity of self-contained natural-circulating journal bearings is quite restricted. The factor limiting better performance is the heat-dissipation capability of the bearing. A ﬁrst thought of a way to increase heat dissipation is to cool the sump with an external ﬂuid such as water. The high-temperature problem is in the ﬁlm where the heat is generated but cooling is not possible in the ﬁlm until later. This does not pro- tect against exceeding the maximum allowable temperature of the lubricant. A second alternative is to reduce the temperature rise in the ﬁlm by dramatically increasing the rate of lubricant ﬂow. The lubricant itself is reducing the temperature rise. A water- cooled sump may still be in the picture. To increase lubricant ﬂow, an external pump must be used with lubricant supplied at pressures of tens of pounds per square inch gage. Because the lubricant is supplied to the bearing under pressure, such bearings are called pressure-fed bearings. To force a greater ﬂow through the bearing and thus obtain an increased cooling effect, a common practice is to use a circumferential groove at the center of the bearing, with an oil-supply hole located opposite the load-bearing zone. Such a bearing is shown in Fig. 12–27. The effect of the groove is to create two half-bearings, each having a smaller l/dratio than the original. The groove divides the pressure-distribution curve into two lobes and reduces the minimum ﬁlm thickness, but it has wide acceptance among lubrication engineers because such bearings carry more load without overheating. To set up a method of solution for oil ﬂow, we shall assume a groove ample enough that the pressure drop in the groove itself is small. Initially we will neglect eccentricity and then apply a correction factor for this condition. The oil ﬂow, then, is the amount that ﬂows out of the two halves of the bearing in the direction of the concentric shaft. If we neglect the rotation of the shaft, the ﬂow of the lubricant is caused by the supplyFigure 12–26 Temperature limits for mineral oils. The lower limit is for oils containing antioxidants and applies when oxygen supply is unlimited. The upper limit applies when insigniﬁcant oxygen is present. The life in the shaded zone depends on the amount of oxygen and catalysts present. (Source: M. J.

Since the diameter and length of a bearing depend upon the unit load, these tables will help the designer to establish a starting point in the design.

A long bearing (large l/dratio) reduces the coefﬁcient of friction and the side ﬂow of oil and therefore is desirable where thin-ﬁlm or boundary-value lubrication is present. On the other hand, where forced-feed or pos- itive lubrication is present, the l/dratio should be relatively small. The short bearing length results in a greater ﬂow of oil out of the ends, thus keeping the bearing cooler. Current practice is to use an l/dratio of about unity, in general, and then to increase this ratio if thin-ﬁlm lubrication is likely to occur and to decrease it for thick-ﬁlm lubri- cation or high temperatures. If shaft deﬂection is likely to be severe, a short bearing should be used to prevent metal-to-metal contact at the ends of the bearings. You should always consider the use of a partial bearing if high temperatures are a problem, because relieving the non-load-bearing area of a bearing can very substantially reduce the heat generated. The two conﬂicting requirements of a good bearing material are that it must have a satisfactory compressive and fatigue strength to resist the externally applied loads and that it must be soft and have a low melting point and a low modulus of elasticity. The second set of requirements is necessary to permit the material to wear or break in, since the material can then conform to slight irregularities and absorb and release foreign par- ticles. The resistance to wear and the coefﬁcient of friction are also important because all bearings must operate, at least for part of the time, with thin-ﬁlm or boundary lubrication. Additional considerations in the selection of a good bearing material are its ability to resist corrosion and, of course, the cost of producing the bearing. Some of the com- monly used materials are listed in Table 12–6, together with their composition and characteristics. Bearing life can be increased very substantially by depositing a layer of babbitt, or other white metal, in thicknesses from 0.001 to 0.014 in over steel backup material. In fact, a copper-lead layer on steel to provide strength, combined with a babbitt overlay to enhance surface conformability and corrosion resistance, makes an excellent bearing. Small bushings and thrust collars are often expected to run with thin-ﬁlm or bound- ary lubrication. When this is the case, improvements over a solid bearing material canbud29281_ch12_617-672.qxd 12/16/09 9:51 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:658 Mechanical Engineering Design be made to add signiﬁcantly to the life. A powder-metallurgy bushing is porous and per- mits the oil to penetrate into the bushing material. Sometimes such a bushing may be enclosed by oil-soaked material to provide additional storage space. Bearings are fre- quently ball-indented to provide small basins for the storage of lubricant while the jour- nal is at rest. This supplies some lubrication during starting. Another method of reducing friction is to indent the bearing wall and to ﬁll the indentations with graphite. With all these tentative decisions made, a lubricant can be selected and the hydro- dynamic analysis made as already presented. The values of the various performance parameters, if plotted as in Fig. 12–25, for example, will then indicate whether a satis- factory design has been achieved or additional iterations are necessary. 12–13 Bearing Types A bearing may be as simple as a hole machined into a cast-iron machine member. It may still be simple yet require detailed design procedures, as, for example, the two- piece grooved pressure-fed connecting-rod bearing in an automotive engine. Or it may be as elaborate as the large water-cooled, ring-oiled bearings with built-in reservoirs used on heavy machinery. Figure 12–32 shows two types of bushings. The solid bushing is made by casting, by drawing and machining, or by using a powder-metallurgy process. The lined bushing is usually a split type. In one method of manufacture the molten lining material is cast continuously on thin strip steel. The babbitted strip is then processed through presses, shavers, and broaches, resulting in a lined bushing. Any type of grooving may be cut into the bushings. Bushings are assembled as a press ﬁt and ﬁnished by boring, reaming, or burnishing. Flanged and straight two-piece bearings are shown in Fig. 12–33. These are avail- able in many sizes in both thick- and thin-wall types, with or without lining material. A locking lug positions the bearing and effectively prevents axial or rotational movement of the bearing in the housing. Some typical groove patterns are shown in Fig. 12–34. In general, the lubricant may be brought in from the end of the bushing, through the shaft, or through the bush- ing. The ﬂow may be intermittent or continuous. The preferred practice is to bring the (a) Solid bushing (b) Lined bushingFigure 12–32 Sleeve bushings.

The design and analysis of thrust bear- ings is an important application of lubrication theory, too. A detailed study of thrust bearings is not included here, because it would not contribute anything signiﬁcantly different and because of space limitations. Having studied this chapter, you should experience no difﬁculty in reading the literature on thrust bearings and applying that knowledge to actual design situations.11 Figure 12–35 shows a ﬁxed-pad thrust bearing consisting essentially of a runner slid- ing over a ﬁxed pad. The lubricant is brought into the radial grooves and pumped into the wedge-shaped space by the motion of the runner. Full-ﬁlm, or hydrodynamic, lubrication is obtained if the speed of the runner is continuous and sufﬁciently high, if the lubricant has the correct viscosity, and if it is supplied in sufﬁcient quantity. Figure 12–36 provides a picture of the pressure distribution under conditions of full-ﬁlm lubrication. We should note that bearings are frequently made with a ﬂange, as shown in Fig. 12–37. The ﬂange positions the bearing in the housing and also takes a thrust load. Even when it is grooved, however, and has adequate lubrication, such an arrangement is not theoretically a hydrodynamically lubricated thrust bearing. The reason for this is that the clearance space is not wedge-shaped but has a uniform thickness. Similar rea- soning would apply to various designs of thrust washers.(a) (e)(b) (f)(c) (g)(d) (h)Figure 12–34 Developed views of typical groove patterns.

Boundary- or thin-ﬁlm lubrication occurs in hydrodynamically lubricated bearings when they are starting or stopping, when the load increases, when the supply of lubricant decreases, or whenever other operating changes happen to occur. There are, of course, a very large number of cases in design in which boundary-lubricated bearings must be used because of the type of application or the competitive situation. The coefﬁcient of friction for boundary-lubricated surfaces may be greatly decreased by the use of animal or vegetable oils mixed with the mineral oil or grease. Fatty acids, such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, or oleic acid, or several of these, which occur in animal and vegetable fats, are called oiliness agents . These acids appear to reduce friction, either because of their strong afﬁnity for certain metallic surfaces or because they form a soap ﬁlm that binds itself to the metallic surfaces by a chemical reaction. Thus the fatty-acid molecules bind themselves to the journal and bearing sur- faces with such great strength that the metallic asperities of the rubbing metals do not weld or shear. Fatty acids will break down at temperatures of 250◦F or more, causing increased friction and wear in thin-ﬁlm-lubricated bearings. In such cases the extreme-pressure, or EP, lubricants may be mixed with the fatty-acid lubricant. These are composed of chemicals such as chlorinated esters or tricresyl phosphate, which form an organic ﬁlm between the rubbing surfaces. Though the EP lubricants make it possible to operate at higher temperatures, there is the added possibility of excessive chemical corrosion of the sliding surfaces. When a bearing operates partly under hydrodynamic conditions and partly under dry or thin-ﬁlm conditions, a mixed-ﬁlm lubrication exists. If the lubricant is supplied by hand oiling, by drop or mechanical feed, or by wick feed, for example, the bearing isU hRunner Thrust bearing padPressure distribution Figure 12–36 Pressure distribution of lubricant in a thrust bearing.

In addition to occurring with a scarcity of lubri- cant, mixed-ﬁlm conditions may be present when •The viscosity is too low. •The bearing speed is too low. •The bearing is overloaded. •The clearance is too tight. •Journal and bearing are not properly aligned. Relative motion between surfaces in contact in the presence of a lubricant is called boundary lubrication . This condition is present in hydrodynamic ﬁlm bearings during starting, stopping, overloading, or lubricant deﬁciency. Some bearings are boundary lubricated (or dry) at all times. To signal this an adjective is placed before the word “bearing.” Commonly applied adjectives (to name a few) are thin-ﬁlm, boundary fric- tion, Oilite, Oiles, and bushed-pin. The applications include situations in which thick ﬁlm will not develop and there are low journal speed, oscillating journal, padded slides, light loads, and lifetime lubrication. The characteristics include considerable friction, ability to tolerate expected wear without losing function, and light loading. Such bear- ings are limited by lubricant temperature, speed, pressure, galling, and cumulative wear. Table 12–7 gives some properties of a range of bushing materials.

Figure 13–2 Helical gears are used to transmit motion between parallel or nonparallel shafts.This chapter addresses gear geometry, the kinematic relations, and the forces transmit- ted by the four principal types of gears: spur, helical, bevel, and worm gears. The forces transmitted between meshing gears supply torsional moments to shafts for motion and power transmission and create forces and moments that affect the shaft and its bearings. The next two chapters will address stress, strength, safety, and reliability of the four types of gears. 13–1 Types of Gears Spur gears, illustrated in Fig. 13–1, have teeth parallel to the axis of rotation and are used to transmit motion from one shaft to another, parallel, shaft. Of all types, the spur gear is the simplest and, for this reason, will be used to develop the primary kinematic relationships of the tooth form. Helical gears, shown in Fig. 13–2, have teeth inclined to the axis of rotation. Helical gears can be used for the same applications as spur gears and, when so used, are not as noisy, because of the more gradual engagement of the teeth during meshing. The inclined tooth also develops thrust loads and bending couples, which are not present with spur gearing. Sometimes helical gears are used to transmit motion between nonparallel shafts. Bevel gears, shown in Fig. 13–3, have teeth formed on conical surfaces and are used mostly for transmitting motion between intersecting shafts. The ﬁgure actually illustrates straight-tooth bevel gears. Spiral bevel gears are cut so the tooth is no longer straight, but forms a circular arc. Hypoid gears are quite similar to spiral bevel gears except that the shafts are offset and nonintersecting.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Gears—General 675 Figure 13–3 Bevel gears are used to transmit rotary motion between intersecting shafts. Worms and worm gears, shown in Fig. 13–4, represent the fourth basic gear type. As shown, the worm resembles a screw. The direction of rotation of the worm gear, also called the worm wheel, depends upon the direction of rotation of the worm and upon whether the worm teeth are cut right-hand or left-hand. Worm gearsets are also made so that the teeth of one or both wrap partly around the other. Such sets are called single- enveloping and double-enveloping worm gearsets. Worm gearsets are mostly used when the speed ratios of the two shafts are quite high, say, 3 or more. 13–2 Nomenclature The terminology of spur-gear teeth is illustrated in Fig. 13–5. The pitch circle is a the- oretical circle upon which all calculations are usually based; its diameter is the pitch diameter. The pitch circles of a pair of mating gears are tangent to each other. A pinion is the smaller of two mating gears. The larger is often called the gear. The circular pitch p is the distance, measured on the pitch circle, from a point on one tooth to a corresponding point on an adjacent tooth. Thus the circular pitch is equal to the sum of the tooth thickness and the width of space.Figure 13–4 Worm gearsets are used to transmit rotary motion between nonparallel and nonintersecting shafts.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/18/09 4:07 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:676 Mechanical Engineering Design Addendum Dedendum ClearanceBottom land Fillet radius Dedendum circleClearance circleTooth thicknessFace width Width of spaceFaceTop land Addendum circle Pitch circleFlankCircular pitchFigure 13–5 Nomenclature of spur-gear teeth. The module m is the ratio of the pitch diameter to the number of teeth. The cus- tomary unit of length used is the millimeter. The module is the index of tooth size in SI. The diametral pitch P is the ratio of the number of teeth on the gear to the pitch diameter. Thus, it is the reciprocal of the module. Since diametral pitch is used only with U.S. units, it is expressed as teeth per inch. The addendum a is the radial distance between the top land and the pitch circle. The dedendum b is the radial distance from the bottom land to the pitch circle. The whole depth htis the sum of the addendum and the dedendum. The clearance circle is a circle that is tangent to the addendum circle of the mat- ing gear. The clearance c is the amount by which the dedendum in a given gear exceeds the addendum of its mating gear. The backlash is the amount by which the width of a tooth space exceeds the thickness of the engaging tooth measured on the pitch circles. You should prove for yourself the validity of the following useful relations: P=N d(13–1) m=d N(13–2) p=πd N=πm (13–3) pP=π (13–4) where P=diametral pitch, teeth per inch N=number of teeth d=pitch diameter, in m=module, mm d=pitch diameter, mm p=circular pitchbud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Gears—General 677 OBrBrA bcaAO PFigure 13–6 Cam Aand follower Bin contact. When the contacting surfaces are involute proﬁles, the ensuing conjugate action produces a constant angular-velocity ratio.13–3 Conjugate Action The following discussion assumes the teeth to be perfectly formed, perfectly smooth, and absolutely rigid. Such an assumption is, of course, unrealistic, because the applica- tion of forces will cause deﬂections. Mating gear teeth acting against each other to produce rotary motion are similar to cams. When the tooth proﬁles, or cams, are designed so as to produce a constant angular- velocity ratio during meshing, these are said to have conjugate action . In theory, at least, it is possible arbitrarily to select any proﬁle for one tooth and then to ﬁnd a proﬁle for the meshing tooth that will give conjugate action. One of these solutions is the involute proﬁle, which, with few exceptions, is in universal use for gear teeth and is the only one with which we should be concerned. When one curved surface pushes against another (Fig. 13–6), the point of contact occurs where the two surfaces are tangent to each other (point c), and the forces at any instant are directed along the common normal abto the two curves. The line ab, rep- resenting the direction of action of the forces, is called the line of action . The line of action will intersect the line of centers O-Oat some point P. The angular-velocity ratio between the two arms is inversely proportional to their radii to the point P. Circles drawn through point Pfrom each center are called pitch circles, and the radius of each circle is called the pitch radius . Point Pis called the pitch point. Figure 13–6 is useful in making another observation. A pair of gears is really pairs of cams that act through a small arc and, before running off the involute contour, are replaced by another identical pair of cams. The cams can run in either direction and are conﬁgured to transmit a constant angular-velocity ratio. If involute curves are used, the gears tolerate changes in center-to-center distance with novariation in constant angular-velocity ratio. Furthermore, the rack proﬁles are straight-ﬂanked, making pri- mary tooling simpler. To transmit motion at a constant angular-velocity ratio, the pitch point must remain ﬁxed; that is, all the lines of action for every instantaneous point of contact must pass through the same point P. In the case of the involute proﬁle, it will be shown that all points of contact occur on the same straight line ab, that all normals to the tooth proﬁles at the point of contact coincide with the line ab, and, thus, that these proﬁles transmit uniform rotary motion.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:678 Mechanical Engineering Design ++ +Base circle Pitch circle O1 O2ca P edgf bd Bbc e a AO fPitch circleGear 1 Gear 2Base circle (a)( b)Figure 13–7 (a) Generation of an involute; (b) involute action. 13–4 Involute Properties An involute curve may be generated as shown in Fig. 13–7 a. A partial ﬂange Bis attached to the cylinder A,around which is wrapped a cord def,which is held tight. Point b on the cord represents the tracing point, and as the cord is wrapped and unwrapped about the cylinder, point bwill trace out the involute curve ac.The radius of the curvature of the involute varies continuously, being zero at point aand a maximum at point c.At point bthe radius is equal to the distance be,since point bis instantaneously rotating about point e.Thus the generating line deis normal to the involute at all points of inter- section and, at the same time, is always tangent to the cylinder A.The circle on which the involute is generated is called the base circle. Let us now examine the involute proﬁle to see how it satisﬁes the requirement for the transmission of uniform motion. In Fig. 13–7 b, two gear blanks with ﬁxed centers at O1and O2are shown having base circles whose respective radii are O1aand O2b. We now imagine that a cord is wound clockwise around the base circle of gear 1, pulled tight between points aand b,and wound counterclockwise around the base circle of gear 2. If, now, the base circles are rotated in different directions so as to keep the cord tight, a point gon the cord will trace out the involutes cdon gear 1 and efon gear 2. The involutes are thus generated simultaneously by the tracing point. The tracing point, therefore, represents the point of contact, while the portion of the cord abis the gener- ating line. The point of contact moves along the generating line; the generating line does not change position, because it is always tangent to the base circles; and since the generating line is always normal to the involutes at the point of contact, the requirement for uniform motion is satisﬁed. 13–5 Fundamentals Among other things, it is necessary that you actually be able to draw the teeth on a pair of meshing gears. You should understand, however, that you are not doing this for man- ufacturing or shop purposes. Rather, we make drawings of gear teeth to obtain an under- standing of the problems involved in the meshing of the mating teeth.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Gears—General 679 OBase circle InvoluteA4 A3 A2 A1 A0B1B2B3B4Figure 13–8 Construction of an involute curve. First, it is necessary to learn how to construct an involute curve. As shown in Fig. 13–8, divide the base circle into a number of equal parts, and construct radial lines OA 0, OA 1, OA 2, etc. Beginning at A1, construct perpendiculars A1B1, A2B2, A3B3, etc. Then along A1B1lay off the distance A1A0, along A2B2lay off twice the distance A1A0, etc., producing points through which the involute curve can be constructed. To investigate the fundamentals of tooth action, let us proceed step by step through the process of constructing the teeth on a pair of gears. When two gears are in mesh, their pitch circles roll on one another without slip- ping. Designate the pitch radii as r1and r2and the angular velocities as ω1and ω2, respectively. Then the pitch-line velocity is V=|r1ω1|=|r2ω2| Thus the relation between the radii on the angular velocities is /vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleω1 ω2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=r2 r1(13–5) Suppose now we wish to design a speed reducer such that the input speed is 1800 rev/min and the output speed is 1200 rev/min. This is a ratio of 3:2; the gear pitch diam- eters would be in the same ratio, for example, a 4-in pinion driving a 6-in gear. The various dimensions found in gearing are always based on the pitch circles. Suppose we specify that an 18-tooth pinion is to mesh with a 30-tooth gear and that the diametral pitch of the gearset is to be 2 teeth per inch. Then, from Eq. (13–1), the pitch diameters of the pinion and gear are, respectively, d1=N1 P=18 2=9i n d2=N2 P=30 2=15 in The ﬁrst step in drawing teeth on a pair of mating gears is shown in Fig. 13–9. The cen- ter distance is the sum of the pitch radii, in this case 12 in. So locate the pinion and gear centers O1and O2, 12 in apart. Then construct the pitch circles of radii r1and r2. These are tangent at P, the pitch point . Next draw line ab, the common tangent, through the pitch point. We now designate gear 1 as the driver, and since it is rotating counter- clockwise, we draw a line cdthrough point Pat an angle φto the common tangent ab. The line cdhas three names, all of which are in general use. It is called the pressure line, the generating line, and the line of action . It represents the direction in which the resultant force acts between the gears. The angle φis called the pressure angle, and it usually has values of 20 or 25◦, though 141 2◦was once used.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:680 Mechanical Engineering Design OrP Pitch circle Pressure line Base circlerB/H9278 /H9278Figure 13–10 Base circle radius can be related to the pressure angle φ and the pitch circle radius by rb=rcosφ. Next, on each gear draw a circle tangent to the pressure line. These circles are the base circles . Since they are tangent to the pressure line, the pressure angle determines their size. As shown in Fig. 13–10, the radius of the base circle is rb=rcosφ (13–6) where ris the pitch radius. Now generate an involute on each base circle as previously described and as shown in Fig. 13–9. This involute is to be used for one side of a gear tooth. It is not necessary to draw another curve in the reverse direction for the other side of the tooth, because we are going to use a template which can be turned over to obtain the other side. The addendum and dedendum distances for standard interchangeable teeth are, as we shall learn later, 1/Pand 1.25/P, respectively. Therefore, for the pair of gears we are constructing, a=1 P=1 2=0.500 in b=1.25 P=1.25 2=0.625 in Using these distances, draw the addendum and dedendum circles on the pinion and on the gear as shown in Fig. 13–9. Next, using heavy drawing paper, or preferably, a sheet of 0.015- to 0.020-in clear plastic, cut a template for each involute, being careful to locate the gear centers prop- erly with respect to each involute. Figure 13–11 is a reproduction of the template used to create some of the illustrations for this book. Note that only one side of the tooth pro- ﬁle is formed on the template. To get the other side, turn the template over. For some problems you might wish to construct a template for the entire tooth.Base circle+ +Dedendum circle Pitch circle Base circle Involute Addendum circles Pitch circleb dac PO1 O2r1 r2 Dedendum circleInvolute/H92751 /H92752/H9278Figure 13–9 Circles of a gear layout. bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Gears—General 681 21 O2O1Figure 13–11 A template for drawing gear teeth.

To draw a tooth, we must know the tooth thickness. From Eq. (13–4), the circular pitch is p=π P=π 2=1.57 in Therefore, the tooth thickness is t=p 2=1.57 2=0.785 in measured on the pitch circle. Using this distance for the tooth thickness as well as the tooth space, draw as many teeth as desired, using the template, after the points have been marked on the pitch circle. In Fig. 13–12 only one tooth has been drawn on each gear. You may run into trouble in drawing these teeth if one of the base circles happens to be larger than the dedendum circle. The reason for this is that the involute begins at the base circle and is undeﬁned below this circle. So, in drawing gear teeth, we usually draw a radial line for the proﬁle below the base circle. The actual shape, however, will depend upon the kind of machine tool used to form the teeth in manufacture, that is, how the proﬁle is generated. The portion of the tooth between the clearance circle and the dedendum circle includes the ﬁllet. In this instance the clearance is c=b−a=0.625−0.500=0.125 in The construction is ﬁnished when these ﬁllets have been drawn.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:682 Mechanical Engineering Design Circular pitchBase pitch /H9278 pcpbFigure 13–13 Involute-toothed pinion and rack.Referring again to Fig. 13–12, the pinion with center at O1is the driver and turns counterclockwise. The pressure, or generating, line is the same as the cord used in Fig. 13–7 ato generate the involute, and contact occurs along this line. The initial con- tact will take place when the ﬂank of the driver comes into contact with the tip of the driven tooth. This occurs at point ain Fig. 13–12, where the addendum circle of the dri- ven gear crosses the pressure line. If we now construct tooth proﬁles through point a and draw radial lines from the intersections of these proﬁles with the pitch circles to the gear centers, we obtain the angle of approach for each gear. As the teeth go into mesh, the point of contact will slide up the side of the driving tooth so that the tip of the driver will be in contact just before contact ends. The ﬁnal point of contact will therefore be where the addendum circle of the driver crosses the pressure line. This is point bin Fig. 13–12. By drawing another set of tooth proﬁles through b, we obtain the angle of recess for each gear in a manner similar to that of ﬁnd- ing the angles of approach. The sum of the angle of approach and the angle of recess for either gear is called the angle of action. The line abis called the line of action. We may imagine a rack as a spur gear having an inﬁnitely large pitch diameter. Therefore, the rack has an inﬁnite number of teeth and a base circle which is an inﬁnite distance from the pitch point. The sides of involute teeth on a rack are straight lines making an angle to the line of centers equal to the pressure angle. Figure 13–13 shows an involute rack in mesh with a pinion. Corresponding sides on involute teeth are par- allel curves; the base pitch is the constant and fundamental distance between them along a common normal as shown in Fig. 13–13. The base pitch is related to the circu- lar pitch by the equation pb=pccosφ (13–7) where pbis the base pitch. Figure 13–14 shows a pinion in mesh with an internal, or ring, gear. Note that both of the gears now have their centers of rotation on the same side of the pitch point. Thus the positions of the addendum and dedendum circles with respect to the pitch circle are reversed; the addendum circle of the internal gear lies inside the pitch circle. Note, too, from Fig. 13–14, that the base circle of the internal gear lies inside the pitch circle near the addendum circle. Another interesting observation concerns the fact that the operating diameters of the pitch circles of a pair of meshing gears need not be the same as the respective design pitch diameters of the gears, though this is the way they have been constructed in Fig. 13–12. If we increase the center distance, we create two new operating pitch circles having larger diameters because they must be tangent to each other at the pitch point.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/18/09 9:33 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Gears—General 683 Thus the pitch circles of gears really do not come into existence until a pair of gears are brought into mesh. Changing the center distance has no effect on the base circles, because these were used to generate the tooth proﬁles. Thus the base circle is basic to a gear. Increasing the center distance increases the pressure angle and decreases the length of the line of action, but the teeth are still conjugate, the requirement for uniform motion transmis- sion is still satisﬁed, and the angular-velocity ratio has not changed. EXAMPLE 13–1 A gearset consists of a 16-tooth pinion driving a 40-tooth gear. The diametral pitch is 2, and the addendum and dedendum are 1/Pand 1.25/P, respectively. The gears are cut using a pressure angle of 20◦. (a) Compute the circular pitch, the center distance, and the radii of the base circles. (b) In mounting these gears, the center distance was incorrectly made 1 4in larger. Compute the new values of the pressure angle and the pitch-circle diameters.

We recall that tooth contact begins and ends at the intersections of the two addendum circles with the pressure line. In Fig. 13–15 initial contact occurs at aand ﬁnal contact at b. Tooth proﬁles drawn through these points intersect the pitch circle at Aand B, respectively. As shown, the dis- tance APis called the arc of approach qa, and the distance PB, the arc of recess qr. The sum of these is the arc of action qt. Now, consider a situation in which the arc of action is exactly equal to the circular pitch, that is, qt=p. This means that one tooth and its space will occupy the entire arc AB. In other words, when a tooth is just beginning contact at a, the previous tooth is simultaneously ending its contact at b. Therefore, during the tooth action from ato b, there will be exactly one pair of teeth in contact. Next, consider a situation in which the arc of action is greater than the circular pitch, but not very much greater, say, qt.=1.2p. This means that when one pair of teeth is just entering contact at a, another pair, already in contact, will not yet have reached b.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Gears—General 685 Thus, for a short period of time, there will be two teeth in contact, one in the vicinity of Aand another near B. As the meshing proceeds, the pair near Bmust cease contact, leaving only a single pair of contacting teeth, until the procedure repeats itself. Because of the nature of this tooth action, either one or two pairs of teeth in con- tact, it is convenient to deﬁne the term contact ratio mcas mc=qt p(13–8) a number that indicates the average number of pairs of teeth in contact. Note that this ratio is also equal to the length of the path of contact divided by the base pitch. Gears should not generally be designed having contact ratios less than about 1.20, because inaccuracies in mounting might reduce the contact ratio even more, increasing the pos- sibility of impact between the teeth as well as an increase in the noise level. An easier way to obtain the contact ratio is to measure the line of action abinstead of the arc distance AB. Since abin Fig. 13–15 is tangent to the base circle when extended, the base pitch pbmust be used to calculate mcinstead of the circular pitch as in Eq. (13–8). If the length of the line of action is Lab, the contact ratio is mc=Lab pcosφ(13–9) in which Eq. (13–7) was used for the base pitch. 13–7 Interference The contact of portions of tooth proﬁles that are not conjugate is called interference . Consider Fig. 13–16. Illustrated are two 16-tooth gears that have been cut to the now obsolete 141 2◦pressure angle. The driver, gear 2, turns clockwise. The initial and ﬁnal points of contact are designated Aand B, respectively, and are located on the pressure line. Now notice that the points of tangency of the pressure line with the base circles C and Dare located inside of points Aand B. Interference is present. The interference is explained as follows. Contact begins when the tip of the driven tooth contacts the ﬂank of the driving tooth. In this case the ﬂank of the driving tooth ﬁrst makes contact with the driven tooth at point A, and this occurs before the involute portion of the driving tooth comes within range. In other words, contact is occurring below the base circle of gear 2 on the noninvolute portion of the ﬂank. The actual effect is that the involute tip or face of the driven gear tends to dig out the noninvolute ﬂank of the driver. In this example the same effect occurs again as the teeth leave contact. Contact should end at point Dor before. Since it does not end until point B, the effect is for the tip of the driving tooth to dig out, or interfere with, the ﬂank of the driven tooth. When gear teeth are produced by a generation process, interference is automati- cally eliminated because the cutting tool removes the interfering portion of the ﬂank. This effect is called undercutting; if undercutting is at all pronounced, the undercut tooth is considerably weakened. Thus the effect of eliminating interference by a gener- ation process is merely to substitute another problem for the original one. The smallest number of teeth on a spur pinion and gear,1one-to-one gear ratio, which can exist without interference is NP. This number of teeth for spur gears is 1Robert Lipp, “Avoiding Tooth Interference in Gears,” Machine Design, V ol. 54, No. 1, 1982, pp. 122–124.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:686 Mechanical Engineering Design given by NP=2k 3 sin2φ/parenleftbigg 1+/radicalBig 1+3 sin2φ/parenrightbigg (13–10) where k=1for full-depth teeth, 0.8 for stub teeth and φ=pressure angle.

Realize that 12.3 teeth is possi- ble in meshing arcs, but for fully rotating gears, 13 teeth represents the least number. For a 141 2◦pressure angle, NP=23 teeth , so one can appreciate why few 141 2◦-tooth systems are used, as the higher pressure angles can produce a smaller pinion with accompanying smaller center-to-center distances. If the mating gear has more teeth than the pinion, that is, mG=NG/NP=mis more than one, then the smallest number of teeth on the pinion without interference is given by NP=2k (1+2m)sin2φ/parenleftbigg m+/radicalBig m2+(1+2m)sin2φ/parenrightbigg (13–11)Driving gear 2Driven gear 3 Base circleBase circle O2O3 /H92752/H92753 Interferen ce is on flank of driver during approa ch This portion of profile is not an invol uteThis portion of profile is not an invol ute Addendum circlesPressure line ACDBFigure 13–16 Interference in the action of gear teeth.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/18/09 9:46 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Gears—General 687 For example, if m=4,φ=20◦, NP=2(1) [1+2(4)] sin220◦/bracketleftbigg 4+/radicalBig 42+[1+2(4)] sin220◦/bracketrightbigg =15.4=16 teeth Thus a 16-tooth pinion will mesh with a 64-tooth gear without interference. The largest gear with a speciﬁed pinion that is interference-free is NG=N2 Psin2φ−4k2 4k−2NPsin2φ(13–12) For example, for a 13-tooth pinion with a pressure angle φof 20◦, NG=132sin220◦−4(1)2 4(1)−2(13)sin220◦=16.45=16 teeth For a 13-tooth spur pinion, the maximum number of gear teeth possible without inter- ference is 16. The smallest spur pinion that will operate with a rack without interference is NP=2(k) sin2φ(13–13) For a 20◦pressure angle full-depth tooth the smallest number of pinion teeth to mesh with a rack is NP=2(1) sin220◦=17.1=18 teeth Since gear-shaping tools amount to contact with a rack, and the gear-hobbing process is similar, the minimum number of teeth to prevent interference to prevent under- cutting by the hobbing process is equal to the value of NPwhen NGis inﬁnite. The importance of the problem of teeth that have been weakened by undercutting cannot be overemphasized. Of course, interference can be eliminated by using more teeth on the pinion. However, if the pinion is to transmit a given amount of power, more teeth can be used only by increasing the pitch diameter. Interference can also be reduced by using a larger pressure angle. This results in a smaller base circle, so that more of the tooth proﬁle becomes involute. The demand for smaller pinions with fewer teeth thus favors the use of a 25◦pressure angle even though the frictional forces and bearing loads are increased and the contact ratio decreased. 13–8 The Forming of Gear Teeth There are a large number of ways of forming the teeth of gears, such as sand casting, shell molding, investment casting, permanent-mold casting, die casting, and centrifugal casting . Teeth can also be formed by using the powder-metallurgy process; or, by using extrusion, a single bar of aluminum may be formed and then sliced into gears. Gears that carry large loads in comparison with their size are usually made of steel and are cut with either form cutters or generating cutters. In form cutting, the tooth space takes the exact form of the cutter. In generating, a tool having a shape different from the tooth proﬁle is moved relative to the gear blank so as to obtain the proper tooth shape. One of the newest and most promising of the methods of forming teeth is called cold form- ing,or cold rolling, in which dies are rolled against steel blanks to form the teeth. The mechanical properties of the metal are greatly improved by the rolling process, and a high-quality generated proﬁle is obtained at the same time.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:688 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 13–17 Generating a spur gear with a pinion cutter. (Courtesy of Boston Gear Works, Inc.)Gear teeth may be machined by milling, shaping, or hobbing. They may be ﬁnished by shaving, burnishing, grinding, or lapping. Gears made of thermoplastics such as nylon, polycarbonate, acetal are quite popular and are easily manufactured by injection molding . These gears are of low to moderate precision, low in cost for high production quantities, and capable of light loads, and can run without lubrication. Milling Gear teeth may be cut with a form milling cutter shaped to conform to the tooth space. With this method it is theoretically necessary to use a different cutter for each gear, because a gear having 25 teeth, for example, will have a different-shaped tooth space from one having, say, 24 teeth. Actually, the change in space is not too great, and it has been found that eight cutters may be used to cut with reasonable accuracy any gear in the range of 12 teeth to a rack. A separate set of cutters is, of course, required for each pitch. Shaping Teeth may be generated with either a pinion cutter or a rack cutter. The pinion cutter (Fig. 13–17) reciprocates along the vertical axis and is slowly fed into the gear blank to the required depth. When the pitch circles are tangent, both the cutter and the blank rotate slightly after each cutting stroke. Since each tooth of the cutter is a cutting tool, the teeth are all cut after the blank has completed one rotation. The sides of an involute rack tooth are straight. For this reason, a rack-generating tool provides an accurate method of cutting gear teeth. This is also a shaping operation and is illustrated by the drawing of Fig. 13–18. In operation, the cutter reciprocates and is ﬁrst fed into the gear blank until the pitch circles are tangent. Then, after each cutting stroke, the gear blank bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Gears—General 689 Figure 13–19 Hobbing a worm gear. (Courtesy of Boston Gear Works, Inc.) and cutter roll slightly on their pitch circles. When the blank and cutter have rolled a distance equal to the circular pitch, the cutter is returned to the starting point, and the process is continued until all the teeth have been cut. Hobbing The hobbing process is illustrated in Fig. 13–19. The hob is simply a cutting tool that is shaped like a worm. The teeth have straight sides, as in a rack, but the hob axis must be turned through the lead angle in order to cut spur-gear teeth. For this reason, the teeth generated by a hob have a slightly different shape from those generated by a rack cutter. Both the hob and the blank must be rotated at the proper angular-velocity ratio. The hob is then fed slowly across the face of the blank until all the teeth have been cut.Gear blank rotate s in thi s direction Rack cutter re ciprocates in a direction perpen dicular to thi s pageFigure 13–18 Shaping teeth with a rack.

Errors may be diminished somewhat by ﬁnishing the tooth proﬁles. The teeth may be ﬁnished, after cutting, by either shav- ing or burnishing. Several shaving machines are available that cut off a minute amount of metal, bringing the accuracy of the tooth proﬁle within the limits of 250 μin. Burnishing, like shaving, is used with gears that have been cut but not heat-treated. In burnishing, hardened gears with slightly oversize teeth are run in mesh with the gear until the surfaces become smooth. Grinding and lapping are used for hardened gear teeth after heat treatment. The grinding operation employs the generating principle and produces very accurate teeth. In lapping, the teeth of the gear and lap slide axially so that the whole surface of the teeth is abraded equally. 13–9 Straight Bevel Gears When gears are used to transmit motion between intersecting shafts, some form of bevel gear is required. A bevel gearset is shown in Fig. 13–20. Although bevel gears are usu- ally made for a shaft angle of 90◦, they may be produced for almost any angle. The teeth may be cast, milled, or generated. Only the generated teeth may be classed as accurate. The terminology of bevel gears is illustrated in Fig. 13–20. The pitch of bevel gears is measured at the large end of the tooth, and both the circular pitch and the pitch diam- eter are calculated in the same manner as for spur gears. It should be noted that the clear- ance is uniform. The pitch angles are deﬁned by the pitch cones meeting at the apex, as shown in the ﬁgure. They are related to the tooth numbers as follows: tanγ=NP NGtan/Gamma1=NG NP(13–14)bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Gears—General 691 Involute Base cylinderEdge of paper Base helix angleFigure 13–21 An involute helicoid.where the subscripts Pand Grefer to the pinion and gear, respectively, and where γand /Gamma1are, respectively, the pitch angles of the pinion and gear. Figure 13–20 shows that the shape of the teeth, when projected on the back cone, is the same as in a spur gear having a radius equal to the back-cone distance rb. This is called Tredgold’s approximation. The number of teeth in this imaginary gear is N/prime=2πrb p(13–15) where N/primeis the virtual number of teeth andpis the circular pitch measured at the large end of the teeth. Standard straight-tooth bevel gears are cut by using a 20◦pressure angle, unequal addenda and dedenda, and full-depth teeth. This increases the contact ratio, avoids undercut, and increases the strength of the pinion. 13–10 Parallel Helical Gears Helical gears, used to transmit motion between parallel shafts, are shown in Fig. 13–2. The helix angle is the same on each gear, but one gear must have a right-hand helix and the other a left-hand helix. The shape of the tooth is an involute helicoid and is illus- trated in Fig. 13–21. If a piece of paper cut in the shape of a parallelogram is wrapped around a cylinder, the angular edge of the paper becomes a helix. If we unwind this paper, each point on the angular edge generates an involute curve. This surface obtained when every point on the edge generates an involute is called an involute helicoid. The initial contact of spur-gear teeth is a line extending all the way across the face of the tooth. The initial contact of helical-gear teeth is a point that extends into a line as the teeth come into more engagement. In spur gears the line of contact is parallel to the axis of rotation; in helical gears the line is diagonal across the face of the tooth. It is this gradual engagement of the teeth and the smooth transfer of load from one tooth to another that gives helical gears the ability to transmit heavy loads at high speeds. Because of the nature of contact between helical gears, the contact ratio is of only minor importance, and it is the contact area, which is proportional to the face width of the gear, that becomes signiﬁcant. Helical gears subject the shaft bearings to both radial and thrust loads. When the thrust loads become high or are objectionable for other reasons, it may be desirable to use double helical gears. A double helical gear (herringbone) is equivalent to two helical gears of opposite hand, mounted side by side on the same shaft. They develop opposite thrust reactions and thus cancel out the thrust load. When two or more single helical gears are mounted on the same shaft, the hand of the gears should be selected so as to produce the minimum thrust load.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:692 Mechanical Engineering Design /H9278tpt/H9274/H9278n Section B–B b d /H9274pn a cepxABA B Section A–A(a) (b) (c)Figure 13–22 Nomenclature of helical gears. Figure 13–22 represents a portion of the top view of a helical rack. Lines aband cd are the centerlines of two adjacent helical teeth taken on the same pitch plane. The angle ψis the helix angle. The distance acis the transverse circular pitch ptin the plane of rotation (usually called the circular pitch ). The distance aeis the normal circular pitch pnand is related to the transverse circular pitch as follows: pn=ptcosψ (13–16) The distance adis called the axial pitch pxand is related by the expression px=pt tanψ(13–17) Since pnPn=π, the normal diametral pitch is Pn=Pt cosψ(13–18) The pressure angle φnin the normal direction is different from the pressure angle φtin the direction of rotation, because of the angularity of the teeth. These angles are related by the equation cosψ=tanφn tanφt(13–19) Figure 13–23 illustrates a cylinder cut by an oblique plane abat an angle ψto a right section. The oblique plane cuts out an arc having a radius of curvature of R. For the condition that ψ=0, the radius of curvature is R=D/2.

The radius Ris the apparent pitch radius of a helical-gear tooth when viewed in the direction of the tooth elements. A gear of the same pitch and with the radius Rwill have a greater number of teeth, because of the increased radius. In helical-gear terminology this is called the virtual number of teeth. It can be shown by analytical geometry that the virtual number of teeth is related to the actual number by the equation N/prime=N cos3ψ(13–20) where N/primeis the virtual number of teeth and Nis the actual number of teeth. It is neces- sary to know the virtual number of teeth in design for strength and also, sometimes, in cutting helical teeth. This apparently larger radius of curvature means that few teeth may be used on helical gears, because there will be less undercutting.

This increase of contact ratio, and the gradual sliding engagement of each tooth, results in quieter gears. 13–11 Worm Gears The nomenclature of a worm gearset is shown in Fig. 13–24. The worm and worm gear of a set have the same hand of helix as for crossed helical gears, but the helix angles are usually quite different. The helix angle on the worm is generally quite large, and that on the gear very small. Because of this, it is usual to specify the lead angle λon the worm and helix angle ψGon the gear; the two angles are equal for a 90◦shaft angle. The worm lead angle is the complement of the worm helix angle, as shown in Fig. 13–24. In specifying the pitch of worm gearsets, it is customary to state the axial pitch px of the worm and the transverse circular pitch pt, often simply called the circular pitch, of the mating gear. These are equal if the shaft angle is 90◦. The pitch diameter of the gear is the diameter measured on a plane containing the worm axis, as shown in Fig. 13–24; it is the same as for spur gears and is dG=NGpt π(13–25)bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:696 Mechanical Engineering Design Since it is not related to the number of teeth, the worm may have any pitch diame- ter; this diameter should, however, be the same as the pitch diameter of the hob used to cut the worm-gear teeth. Generally, the pitch diameter of the worm should be selected so as to fall into the range C0.875 3.0≤dW≤C0.875 1.7(13–26) where Cis the center distance. These proportions appear to result in optimum horse- power capacity of the gearset.

The standards were originally planned to attain interchangeability of gears of all tooth numbers, but of the same pressure angle and pitch. Table 13–1 contains the standards most used for spur gears. A 141 2◦pressure angle was once used for these but is now obsolete; the resulting gears had to be comparatively larger to avoid interference problems. Table 13–2 is particularly useful in selecting the pitch or module of a gear. Cutters are generally available for the sizes shown in this table. Table 13–3 lists the standard tooth proportions for straight bevel gears. These sizes apply to the large end of the teeth. The nomenclature is deﬁned in Fig. 13–20. Standard tooth proportions for helical gears are listed in Table 13–4.

Though there will be exceptions, the face width of helical gears should be at least 2 times the axial pitch to obtain good helical-gear action. Tooth forms for worm gearing have not been highly standardized, perhaps because there has been less need for it. The pressure angles used depend upon the lead angles and must be large enough to avoid undercutting of the worm-gear tooth on the side at which contact ends. A satisfactory tooth depth, which remains in about the right pro- portion to the lead angle, may be obtained by making the depth a proportion of the axial circular pitch. Table 13–5 summarizes what may be regarded as good practice for pres- sure angle and tooth depth. Theface width FGof the worm gear should be made equal to the length of a tangent to the worm pitch circle between its points of intersection with the addendum circle, as shown in Fig. 13–25. 13–13 Gear Trains Consider a pinion 2 driving a gear 3. The speed of the driven gear is n3=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleN2 N3n2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingled2 d3n2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(13–29) where n=revolutions or rev/min N=number of teeth d=pitch diameter Equation (13–29) applies to any gearset no matter whether the gears are spur, helical, bevel, or worm. The absolute-value signs are used to permit complete freedom in choos- ing positive and negative directions. In the case of spur and parallel helical gears, the directions ordinarily correspond to the right-hand rule and are positive for counter- clockwise rotation. Rotational directions are somewhat more difﬁcult to deduce for worm and crossed helical gearsets. Figure 13–26 will be of help in these situations. The gear train shown in Fig. 13–27 is made up of ﬁve gears. The speed of gear 6 is n6=−N2 N3N3 N4N5 N6n2 (a) Hence we notice that gear 3 is an idler, that its tooth numbers cancel in Eq. ( a), and hence that it affects only the direction of rotation of gear 6. We notice, furthermore, thatFG Figure 13–25 A graphical depiction of the face width of the worm of a worm gearset.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/18/09 4:07 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Gears—General 699 Driver (a)( b)Thrust bearing Right hand (c)( d) Left handThrust bearingDriver Driver DriverFigure 13–26 Thrust, rotation, and hand relations for crossed helical gears.

We deﬁne the train value e as e=product of driving tooth numbers product of driven tooth numbers(13–30) Note that pitch diameters can be used in Eq. (13–30) as well. When Eq. (13–30) is used for spur gears, eis positive if the last gear rotates in the same sense as the ﬁrst, and negative if the last rotates in the opposite sense. Now we can write nL=enF (13–31) where nLis the speed of the last gear in the train and nFis the speed of the ﬁrst. As a rough guideline, a train value of up to 10 to 1 can be obtained with one pair of gears. Greater ratios can be obtained in less space and with fewer dynamic problems by compounding additional pairs of gears. A two-stage compound gear train, such as shown in Fig. 13–28, can obtain a train value of up to 100 to 1. The design of gear trains to accomplish a speciﬁc train value is straightforward. Since numbers of teeth on gears must be integers, it is better to determine them ﬁrst, and then obtain pitch diameters second. Determine the number of stages necessary to obtain the overall ratio, then divide the overall ratio into portions to be accomplished in eachbud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:700 Mechanical Engineering Design stage. To minimize package size, keep the portions as evenly divided between the stages as possible. In cases where the overall train value need only be approximated, each stage can be identical. For example, in a two-stage compound gear train, assign the square root of the overall train value to each stage. If an exact train value is needed, attempt to factor the overall train value into integer components for each stage. Then assign the smallest gear(s) to the minimum number of teeth allowed for the speciﬁc ratio of each stage, in order to avoid interference (see Sec. 13–7). Finally, applying the ratio for each stage, determine the necessary number of teeth for the mating gears. Round to the nearest integer and check that the resulting overall ratio is within acceptable tolerance.Figure 13–28 A two-stage compound gear train. EXAMPLE 13–3 A gearbox is needed to provide a 30:1 ( ±1 percent) increase in speed, while minimiz- ing the overall gearbox size. Specify appropriate teeth numbers. Solution Since the ratio is greater than 10:1, but less than 100:1, a two-stage compound gear train, such as in Figure 13–28, is needed. The portion to be accomplished in each stage is √ 30=5.4772 . For this ratio, assuming a typical 20° pressure angle, the minimum number of teeth to avoid interference is 16, according to Eq. (13–11). The number of teeth necessary for the mating gears is Answer 16√ 30=87.64˙=88 From Eq. (13–30), the overall train value is e=(88/16)(88/16)=30.25 This is within the 1 percent tolerance. If a closer tolerance is desired, then increase the pinion size to the next integer and try again.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Gears—General 701 EXAMPLE 13–4 A gearbox is needed to provide an exact 30:1 increase in speed, while minimizing the overall gearbox size. Specify appropriate teeth numbers. Solution The previous example demonstrated the difﬁculty with ﬁnding integer numbers of teeth to provide an exact ratio. In order to obtain integers, factor the overall ratio into two integer stages. e=30=(6)(5) N2/N3=6 and N4/N5=5 With two equations and four unknown numbers of teeth, two free choices are avail- able. Choose N3and N5to be as small as possible without interference. Assuming a 20° pressure angle, Eq. (13–11) gives the minimum as 16. Then N2=6N3=6 (16) =96 N4=5N5=5 (16) =80 The overall train value is then exact. e=(96/16)(80 /16)=(6)(5) =30 It is sometimes desirable for the input shaft and the output shaft of a two-stage compound gear train to be in-line, as shown in Fig. 13–29. This conﬁguration is called a compound reverted gear train . This requires the distances between the shafts to be the same for both stages of the train, which adds to the complexity of the design task. The distance constraint is d2/2+d3/2=d4/2+d5/2 Figure 13–29 A compound reverted gear train. 522 3 45 43bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:702 Mechanical Engineering Design EXAMPLE 13–5 A gearbox is needed to provide an exact 30:1 increase in speed, while minimizing the overall gearbox size. The input and output shafts should be in-line. Specify appropriate teeth numbers. Solution The governing equations are N2/N3=6 N4/N5=5 N2+N3=N4+N5 With three equations and four unknown numbers of teeth, only one free choice is available. Of the two smaller gears, N3and N5, the free choice should be used to mini- mize N3since a greater gear ratio is to be achieved in this stage. To avoid interference, the minimum for N3is 16. Applying the governing equations yields N2=6N3=6(16) =96 N2+N3=96+16=112=N4+N5 Substituting N4=5N5gives 112=5N5+N5=6N5 N5=112/6=18.67 If the train value need only be approximated, then this can be rounded to the nearest integer. But for an exact solution, it is necessary to choose the initial free choice for N3such that solution of the rest of the teeth numbers results exactly in integers. This can be done by trial and error, letting N3=17, then 18, etc., until it works. Or, the problem can be normalized to quickly determine the minimum free choice. Beginning again, let the free choice be N3=1. Applying the governing equations gives N2=6N3=6(1)=6 N2+N3=6+1=7=N4+N5The diametral pitch relates the diameters and the numbers of teeth, P/H11005N/d. Replacing all the diameters gives N2/(2P)+N3/(2P)=N4/(2P)+N5/(2P) Assuming a constant diametral pitch in both stages, we have the geometry condition stated in terms of numbers of teeth: N2+N3=N4+N5 This condition must be exactly satisﬁed, in addition to the previous ratio equations, to provide for the in-line condition on the input and output shafts.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Gears—General 703 Substituting N4=5N5, we ﬁnd 7=5N5+N5=6N5 N5=7/6 This fraction could be eliminated if it were multiplied by a multiple of 6. The free choice for the smallest gear N3should be selected as a multiple of 6 that is greater than the minimum allowed to avoid interference. This would indicate that N3=18. Repeating the application of the governing equations for the ﬁnal time yields N2=6N3=6(18) =108 N2+N3=108+18=126=N4+N5 126=5N5+N5=6N5 N5=126/6=21 N4=5N5=5(21) =105 Thus, Answer N2=108 N3=18 N4=105 N5=21 Checking, we calculate e=(108/18)(105 /21)=(6)(5) =30. And checking the geometry constraint for the in-line requirement, we calculate N2+N3=N4+N5 108+18=105+21 126=126 Unusual effects can be obtained in a gear train by permitting some of the gear axes to rotate about others. Such trains are called planetary, or epicyclic, gear trains. Planetary trains always include a sun gear, a planet carrier or arm, and one or more planet gears, as shown in Fig. 13–30. Planetary gear trains are unusual mechanisms because they have two degrees of freedom; that is, for constrained motion, a planetary train must have two inputs. For example, in Fig. 13–30 these two inputs could be the motion of any two of the elements of the train. We might, say, specify that the sun gear rotates at 100 rev/min clockwise and that the ring gear rotates at 50 rev/min counter- clockwise; these are the inputs. The output would be the motion of the arm. In most planetary trains one of the elements is attached to the frame and has no motion.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:704 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 13–31 shows a planetary train composed of a sun gear 2, an arm or carrier 3, and planet gears 4 and 5. The angular velocity of gear 2 relative to the arm in rev/min is n23=n2−n3 (b) Also, the velocity of gear 5 relative to the arm is n53=n5−n3 (c) Dividing Eq. ( c) by Eq. ( b) gives n53 n23=n5−n3 n2−n3(d) Equation ( d) expresses the ratio of gear 5 to that of gear 2, and both velocities are taken relative to the arm. Now this ratio is the same and is proportional to the tooth numbers, whether the arm is rotating or not. It is the train value.

Beginning with the numeral 1 for the frame of the machine, we shall designate the input gear as gear 2, and then number the gears successively 3, 4, etc., until webud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:706 Mechanical Engineering Design arrive at the last gear in the train. Next, there may be several shafts involved, and usu- ally one or two gears are mounted on each shaft as well as other elements. We shall des- ignate the shafts, using lowercase letters of the alphabet, a, b, c, etc. With this notation we can now speak of the force exerted by gear 2 against gear 3 as F23. The force of gear 2 against a shaft ais F2a. We can also write Fa2to mean the force of a shaft aagainst gear 2. Unfortunately, it is also necessary to use super- scripts to indicate directions. The coordinate directions will usually be indicated by the x, y, and zcoordinates, and the radial and tangential directions by superscripts r and t. With this notation, Ft 43is the tangential component of the force of gear 4 acting against gear 3. Figure 13–32 ashows a pinion mounted on shaft arotating clockwise at n2rev/min and driving a gear on shaft bat n3rev/min. The reactions between the mating teeth occur along the pressure line. In Fig. 13–32 bthe pinion has been separated from the gear and the shaft, and their effects have been replaced by forces. Fa2and Ta2are the force and torque, respectively, exerted by shaft a against pinion 2. F32is the force exerted by gear 3 against the pinion. Using a similar approach, we obtain the free-body diagram of the gear shown in Fig. 13–32 c. In Fig. 13–33, the free-body diagram of the pinion has been redrawn and the forces have been resolved into tangential and radial components. We now deﬁne Wt=Ft 32(a) as the transmitted load . This tangential load is really the useful component, because the radial component Fr 32serves no useful purpose. It does not transmit power. The applied torque and the transmitted load are seen to be related by the equation T=d 2Wt (b) where we have used T=Ta2and d=d2to obtain a general relation. The power Htransmitted through a rotating gear can be obtained from the standard relationship of the product of torque Tand angular velocity /H9275.

It will often be desirable to work with the power in either horsepower or kilowatts, and appropriate conversion factors should be used. Since meshed gears are reasonably efﬁcient, with losses of less than 2 percent, the power is generally treated as constant through the mesh. Consequently, with a pair of meshed gears, Eq. (13–33) will give the same power regardless of which gear is used for dand /H9275. Gear data is often tabulated using pitch-line velocity , which is the linear velocity of a point on the gear at the radius of the pitch circle; thus V=(d/2)ω.

The teeth are cut on the 20◦full-depth system and have a module of m=2.5mm. Draw a free-body diagram of gear 3 and show all the forces that act upon it. Solution The pitch diameters of gears 2 and 3 are d2=N2m/H1100520(2.5) /H1100550 mm d3=N3m/H1100550(2.5) /H11005125 mm From Eq. (13–36) we ﬁnd the transmitted load to be Wt=60 000 H πd2n=60 000 (2.5) π(50)(1750)=0.546 kN Thus, the tangential force of gear 2 on gear 3 is Ft 23=0.546kN, as shown in Fig. 13–34 b. Therefore Fr 23=Ft 23tan 20◦=(0.546)tan 20◦=0.199 kN and so F23=Ft 23 cos 20◦=0.546 cos 20◦=0.581 kN Since gear 3 is an idler, it transmits no power (torque) to its shaft, and so the tangential reaction of gear 4 on gear 3 is also equal to Wt. Therefore Ft 43=0.546 kN Fr 43=0.199 kN F43=0.581 kN and the directions are shown in Fig. 13–34 b.

While the actual resultant occurs somewhere between the midpoint and the large end of the tooth, there is only a small error in mak- ing this assumption. For the transmitted load, this gives Wt=T rav(13–37) where Tis the torque and ravis the pitch radius at the midpoint of the tooth for the gear under consideration. The forces acting at the center of the tooth are shown in Fig. 13–35. The resultant force Whas three components: a tangential force Wt, a radial force Wr, and an axial force Wa.

From the geometry of the ﬁgure, we see thatbud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Gears—General 715 Wx=Wcosφnsinλ Wy=Wsinφn Wz=Wcosφncosλ(13–41) We now use the subscripts Wand Gto indicate forces acting against the worm and gear, respectively. We note that Wyis the separating, or radial, force for both the worm and the gear. The tangential force on the worm is Wxand is Wzon the gear, assuming a 90◦shaft angle. The axial force on the worm is Wz, and on the gear, Wx. Since the gear forces are opposite to the worm forces, we can summarize these rela- tions by writing WWt=−WGa=Wx WWr=−WGr=Wy WWa=−WGt=Wz(13–42) It is helpful in using Eq. (13–41) and also Eq. (13–42) to observe that the gear axis is parallel to the x direction and the worm axis is parallel to the z direction and that we are employing a right-handed coordinate system. In our study of spur-gear teeth we have learned that the motion of one tooth rela- tive to the mating tooth is primarily a rolling motion; in fact, when contact occurs at the pitch point, the motion is pure rolling. In contrast, the relative motion between worm and worm-gear teeth is pure sliding, and so we must expect that friction plays an impor- tant role in the performance of worm gearing. By introducing a coefﬁcient of friction f, we can develop another set of relations similar to those of Eq. (13–41). In Fig. 13–40 we see that the force Wacting normal to the worm-tooth proﬁle produces a frictional force Wf=fW, having a component fWcosλin the negative xdirection and another component fWsin λin the positive zdirection. Equation (13–41) therefore becomes Wx=W(cosφnsinλ+fcosλ) Wy=Wsinφn Wz=W(cosφncosλ−fsinλ)(13–43) fW sin /H9261 fW cos /H9261/H9261 /H9278n Wf = fW/H9261y Wy W Wx x Wz nW z/H9278t Pitch helix Pitch cylinderFigure 13–40 Drawing of the pitch cylinder of a worm, showing the forces exerted upon it by the worm gear.bud29281_ch13_673-732.qxd 12/17/09 4:54 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:716 Mechanical Engineering Design Equation (13–42), of course, still applies. Inserting −WGtfrom Eq. (13–42) for Wzin Eq. (13–43) and multiplying both sides by f, we ﬁnd the frictional force Wfto be Wf=fW=fW Gt fsinλ−cosφncosλ(13–44) A useful relation between the two tangential forces, WWtand WGt, can be obtained by equating the ﬁrst and third parts of Eqs. (13–42) and (13–43) and eliminating W. The result is WWt=WGtcosφnsinλ+fcosλ fsinλ−cosφncosλ(13–45) Efﬁciency ηcan be deﬁned by using the equation η=WWt(without friction ) WWt(with friction )(a) Substitute Eq. (13–45) with f=0in the numerator of Eq. ( a) and the same equation in the denominator. After some rearranging, you will ﬁnd the efﬁciency to be η=cosφn−ftanλ cosφn+fcotλ(13–46) Selecting a typical value of the coefﬁcient of friction, say f=0.05, and the pressure angles shown in Table 13–6, we can use Eq. (13–46) to get some useful design infor- mation. Solving this equation for helix angles from 1 to 30◦gives the interesting results shown in Table 13–6. Many experiments have shown that the coefﬁcient of friction is dependent on the relative or sliding velocity. In Fig. 13–41, VGis the pitch-line velocity of the gear and VWthe pitch-line velocity of the worm.

Now use the bolt-and-nut analogy (the worm is right- handed, as is the screw thread of a bolt), and turn the bolt clockwise with the right hand while preventing nut rotation with the left. The nut will move axially along the bolt toward your right hand. Therefore the surface of the gear (Fig. 13–43) in contact with the worm will move in the negative zdirection. Thus, the gear rotates clockwise about x, with your right thumb pointing in the negative xdirection.

Failure by bend- ing will occur when the signiﬁcant tooth stress equals or exceeds either the yield strength or the bending endurance strength. A surface failure occurs when the signiﬁcant contact stress equals or exceeds the surface endurance strength. The ﬁrst two sections present a little of the history of the analyses from which current methodology developed. The American Gear Manufacturers Association1(AGMA) has for many years been the responsible authority for the dissemination of knowledge pertaining to the design and analysis of gearing. The methods this organization presents are in general use in the United States when strength and wear are primary considerations. In view of this fact it is important that the AGMA approach to the subject be presented here. The general AGMA approach requires a great many charts and graphs—too many for a single chapter in this book. We have omitted many of these here by choosing a single pressure angle and by using only full-depth teeth. This simpliﬁcation reduces the complexity but does not prevent the development of a basic understanding of the approach. Furthermore, the simpliﬁcation makes possible a better development of the fundamentals and hence should constitute an ideal introduction to the use of the general AGMA method.2Sections 14–1 and 14–2 are elementary and serve as an examination of the foundations of the AGMA method. Table 14–1 is largely AGMA nomenclature. 14–1 The Lewis Bending Equation Wilfred Lewis introduced an equation for estimating the bending stress in gear teeth in which the tooth form entered into the formulation. The equation, announced in 1892, still remains the basis for most gear design today. To derive the basic Lewis equation, refer to Fig. 14–1 a, which shows a cantilever of cross-sectional dimensions Fand t, having a length land a load Wt, uniformly dis- tributed across the face width F. The section modulus I/cis Ft2/6, and therefore the bending stress is σ=M I/c=6Wtl Ft2(a) Gear designers denote the components of gear-tooth forces as Wt,Wr,WaorWt,Wr, Wainterchangeably. The latter notation leaves room for post-subscripts essential to free- body diagrams. For instance, for gears 2 and 3 in mesh, Wt 23is the transmitted force ofbud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/18/09 3:25 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Spur and Helical Gears 735 Symbol Name Where Found b Net width of face of narrowest member Eq.

When working with double- or triple-reduction speed reducers, this notation is compact and essential to clear thinking. Since gear-force components rarely take exponents, this causes no com- plication. Pythagorean combinations, if necessary, can be treated with parentheses or avoided by expressing the relations trigonometrically.bud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/18/09 3:25 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Spur and Helical Gears 737 Figure 14–1 lF tWtWtWr l tarf xW (a)( b) Referring now to Fig. 14–1 b, we assume that the maximum stress in a gear tooth occurs at point a. By similar triangles, you can write t/2 x=l t/2or x=t2 4l(b) By rearranging Eq. ( a), σ=6Wtl Ft2=Wt F1 t2/6l=Wt F1 t2/4l1 4 6(c) If we now substitute the value of xfrom Eq. ( b) in Eq. ( c) and multiply the numerator and denominator by the circular pitch p, we ﬁnd σ=Wtp F/parenleftbig2 3/parenrightbig xp(d) Letting y=2x/3p, we have σ=Wt Fpy(14–1) This completes the development of the original Lewis equation. The factor yis called the Lewis form factor, and it may be obtained by a graphical layout of the gear tooth or by digital computation. In using this equation, most engineers prefer to employ the diametral pitch in determining the stresses. This is done by substituting P=π/pand Y=πyin Eq. (14–1). This gives σ=WtP FY(14–2) where Y=2xP 3(14–3) The use of this equation for Ymeans that only the bending of the tooth is considered and that the compression due to the radial component of the force is neglected. Values of Yobtained from this equation are tabulated in Table 14–2.bud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/18/09 3:25 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:738 Mechanical Engineering Design Number of Number of Teeth Y Teeth Y 12 0.245 28 0.353 13 0.261 30 0.359 14 0.277 34 0.371 15 0.290 38 0.384 16 0.296 43 0.397 17 0.303 50 0.409 18 0.309 60 0.422 19 0.314 75 0.435 20 0.322 100 0.447 21 0.328 150 0.460 22 0.331 300 0.472 24 0.337 400 0.480 26 0.346 Rack 0.485Table 14–2 Values of the Lewis Form Factor Y(These Values Are for a Normal Pressure Angle of 20°, Full-Depth Teeth, and a Diametral Pitch of Unity in the Plane of Rotation) The use of Eq. (14–3) also implies that the teeth do not share the load and that the greatest force is exerted at the tip of the tooth. But we have already learned that the con- tact ratio should be somewhat greater than unity, say about 1.5, to achieve a quality gearset. If, in fact, the gears are cut with sufﬁcient accuracy, the tip-load condition is not the worst, because another pair of teeth will be in contact when this condition occurs. Examination of run-in teeth will show that the heaviest loads occur near the middle of the tooth. Therefore the maximum stress probably occurs while a single pair of teeth is carrying the full load, at a point where another pair of teeth is just on the verge of coming into contact. Dynamic Effects When a pair of gears is driven at moderate or high speed and noise is generated, it is certain that dynamic effects are present. One of the earliest efforts to account for an increase in the load due to velocity employed a number of gears of the same size, mate- rial, and strength. Several of these gears were tested to destruction by meshing and loading them at zero velocity. The remaining gears were tested to destruction at various pitch-line velocities. For example, if a pair of gears failed at 500 lbf tangential load at zero velocity and at 250 lbf at velocity V1, then a velocity factor, designated Kv, of 2 was speciﬁed for the gears at velocity V1. Then another, identical, pair of gears running at a pitch-line velocity V1could be assumed to have a load equal to twice the tangen- tial or transmitted load. Note that the deﬁnition of dynamic factor Kvhas been altered. AGMA standards ANSI/AGMA 2001-D04 and 2101-D04 contain this caution: Dynamic factor Kvhas been redeﬁned as the reciprocal of that used in previous AGMA standards. It is now greater than 1.0. In earlier AGMA standards it was less than 1.0. Care must be taken in referring to work done prior to this change in the standards.bud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/18/09 3:25 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Spur and Helical Gears 739 In the nineteenth century, Carl G. Barth ﬁrst expressed the velocity factor, and in terms of the current AGMA standards, they are represented as Kv=600+V 600(cast iron, cast proﬁle) (14–4 a) Kv=1200+V 1200(cut or milled proﬁle) (14–4 b) where Vis the pitch-line velocity in feet per minute. It is also quite probable, because of the date that the tests were made, that the tests were conducted on teeth having a cycloidal proﬁle instead of an involute proﬁle. Cycloidal teeth were in general use in the nineteenth century because they were easier to cast than involute teeth. Equation (14–4 a) is called the Barth equation . The Barth equation is often modiﬁed into Eq. (14–4 b), for cut or milled teeth. Later AGMA added Kv=50+√ V 50(hobbed or shaped proﬁle) (14–5 a) Kv=/radicalBigg 78+√ V 78(shaved or ground proﬁle) (14–5 b) In SI units, Eqs. (14–4 a) through (14–5 b) become Kv=3.05+V 3.05(cast iron, cast proﬁle) (14–6 a) Kv=6.1+V 6.1(cut or milled proﬁle) (14–6 b) Kv=3.56+√ V 3.56(hobbed or shaped proﬁle) (14–6 c) Kv=/radicalBigg 5.56+√ V 5.56(shaved or ground proﬁle) (14–6 d) where Vis in meters per second (m/s). Introducing the velocity factor into Eq. (14–2) gives σ=KvWtP FY(14–7) The metric version of this equation is σ=KvWt FmY(14–8) where the face width Fand the module mare both in millimeters (mm). Expressing the tangential component of load Wtin newtons (N) then results in stress units of megapascals (MPa). As a general rule, spur gears should have a face width Ffrom 3 to 5 times the circular pitch p. Equations (14–7) and (14–8) are important because they form the basis for the AGMA approach to the bending strength of gear teeth. They are in general use forbud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/18/09 3:25 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:740 Mechanical Engineering Design EXAMPLE 14–1 A stock spur gear is available having a diametral pitch of 8 teeth/in, a 11 2-in face, 16 teeth, and a pressure angle of 20◦with full-depth teeth. The material is AISI 1020 steel in as- rolled condition. Use a design factor of nd=3to rate the horsepower output of the gear corresponding to a speed of 1200 rev/m and moderate applications. Solution The term moderate applications seems to imply that the gear can be rated by using the yield strength as a criterion of failure. From Table A–20, we ﬁnd Sut=55kpsi and Sy=30kpsi. A design factor of 3 means that the allowable bending stress is 30/3= 10 kpsi. The pitch diameter is N/P=16/8=2in, so the pitch-line velocity is V=πdn 12=π(2)1200 12=628 ft/min The velocity factor from Eq. (14–4 b) is found to be Kv=1200+V 1200=1200+628 1200=1.52 Table 14–2 gives the form factor as Y=0.296for 16 teeth. We now arrange and sub- stitute in Eq. (14–7) as follows: Wt=FYσall KvP=1.5(0.296)10 000 1.52(8)=365 lbf The horsepower that can be transmitted is Answer hp=WtV 33 000=365(628) 33 000=6.95 hp It is important to emphasize that this is a rough estimate, and that this approach must not be used for important applications. The example is intended to help you under- stand some of the fundamentals that will be involved in the AGMA approach.estimating the capacity of gear drives when life and reliability are not important con- siderations. The equations can be useful in obtaining a preliminary estimate of gear sizes needed for various applications.

From Table 13–1, the sum of the adden- dum and dedendum is l=1 P+1.25 P=1 8+1.25 8=0.281 in The tooth thickness tin Fig. 14–1 bis given in Sec. 14–1 [Eq. ( b)] as t=(4lx)1/2 when x=3Y/(2P)from Eq. (14–3). Therefore, since from Ex. 14–1 Y=0.296and P=8, x=3Y 2P=3(0.296) 2(8)=0.0555 in then t=(4lx)1/2=[4(0.281)0.0555]1/2=0.250 in We have recognized the tooth as a cantilever beam of rectangular cross section, so the equivalent rotating-beam diameter must be obtained from Eq. (6–25): de=0.808(hb)1/2=0.808(Ft)1/2=0.808[1.5(0.250)]1/2=0.495 in Then, Eq.

With no information given concerning temperature and reliability we will set kd=ke=1. In general, a gear tooth is subjected only to one-way bending. Exceptions include idler gears and gears used in reversing mechanisms. We will account for one-way bending by establishing a miscellaneous-effects Marin factor kf. For one-way bending the steady and alternating stress components are σa=σm= σ/2where σis the largest repeatedly applied bending stress as given in Eq. (14–7). If a material exhibited a Goodman failure locus, Sa S/primee+Sm Sut=1 Since Saand Smare equal for one-way bending, we substitute Safor Smand solve the preceding equation for Sa, giving Sa=S/prime eSut S/primee+Sut Now replace Sawith σ/2, and in the denominator replace S/prime ewith 0.5Sutto obtain σ=2S/prime eSut 0.5Sut+Sut=2S/prime e 0.5+1=1.33S/prime e Now kf=σ/S/prime e=1.33S/prime e/S/prime e=1.33.

It is left as an exercise for the reader to compare Kffrom Eq. (14–9) with the results of using the approxima- tion of Fig. A–15–6 in Ex. 14–2. 14–2 Surface Durability In this section we are interested in the failure of the surfaces of gear teeth, which is generally called wear .Pitting, as explained in Sec. 6–16, is a surface fatigue failure due to many repetitions of high contact stresses. Other surface failures are scoring, which is a lubri- cation failure, and abrasion, which is wear due to the presence of foreign material. To obtain an expression for the surface-contact stress, we shall employ the Hertz theory. In Eq. (3–74) it was shown that the contact stress between two cylinders may be computed from the equation pmax=2F πbl(a) where pmax=largest surface pressure F=force pressing the two cylinders together l=length of cylinders and half-width bis obtained from Eq.

To adapt these relations to the notation used in gearing, we replace Fby Wt/cosφ, dby 2r, and lby the face width F. With these changes, we can substitute the value of bbud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/18/09 3:25 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:744 Mechanical Engineering Design as given by Eq. (14–10) in Eq. ( a).

By accounting for load sharing in the value of Wtused, Eq. (14–11) can be solved for the Hertzian stress for any or all points from the beginning to the end of tooth contact. Of course, pure rolling exists only at the pitch point. Elsewhere the motion is a mixture of rolling and sliding. Equation (14–11) does not account for any sliding action in the evaluation of stress. We note that AGMA uses μfor Poisson’s ratio instead of νas is used here. We have already noted that the ﬁrst evidence of wear occurs near the pitch line. The radii of curvature of the tooth proﬁles at the pitch point are r1=dPsinφ 2r2=dGsinφ 2(14–12) where φis the pressure angle and dPand dGare the pitch diameters of the pinion and gear, respectively. Note, in Eq. (14–11), that the denominator of the second group of terms contains four elastic constants, two for the pinion and two for the gear. As a simple means of com- bining and tabulating the results for various combinations of pinion and gear materials, AGMA deﬁnes an elastic coefﬁcient Cpby the equation Cp=⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎣1 π/parenleftbigg1−ν2 P EP+1−ν2 G EG/parenrightbigg⎤ ⎥⎥⎥⎦1/2 (14–13) With this simpliﬁcation, and the addition of a velocity factor Kv, Eq. (14–11) can be written as σC=−Cp/bracketleftbiggKvWt Fcosφ/parenleftbigg1 r1+1 r2/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg1/2 (14–14) where the sign is negative because σCis a compressive stress. EXAMPLE 14–3 The pinion of Examples 14–1 and 14–2 is to be mated with a 50-tooth gear manufac- tured of ASTM No. 50 cast iron. Using the tangential load of 382 lbf, estimate the factor of safety of the drive based on the possibility of a surface fatigue failure. Solution From Table A–5 we ﬁnd the elastic constants to be EP=30Mpsi, νP=0.292,EG= 14.5Mpsi,νG=0.211. We substitute these in Eq. (14–13) to get the elastic coefﬁcient as Cp=⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎩1 π/bracketleftbigg1−(0.292)2 30(106)+1−(0.211)2 14.5(106)/bracketrightbigg⎫ ⎪⎪⎪⎬ ⎪⎪⎪⎭1/2 =1817bud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/18/09 3:25 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Spur and Helical Gears 745 From Example 14–1, the pinion pitch diameter is dP=2in. The value for the gear is dG=50/8=6.25in. Then Eq. (14–12) is used to obtain the radii of curvature at the pitch points. Thus r1=2 sin 20◦ 2=0.342 in r2=6.25 sin 20◦ 2=1.069 in The face width is given as F=1.5in. Use Kv=1.52from Example 14–1. Substituting all these values in Eq. (14–14) with φ=20◦gives the contact stress as σC=−1817/bracketleftbigg1.52(380) 1.5 cos 20◦/parenleftbigg1 0.342+1 1.069/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg1/2 =−72 400 psi The surface endurance strength of cast iron can be estimated from SC=0.32HBkpsi for 108cycles, where SCis in kpsi. Table A–24 gives HB=262for ASTM No. 50 cast iron. Therefore SC=0.32(262)=83.8kpsi. Contact stress is not linear with transmit- ted load [see Eq. (14–14)]. If the factor of safety is deﬁned as the loss-of-function load divided by the imposed load, then the ratio of loads is the ratio of stresses squared. In other words, n=loss-of-function load imposed load=S2 C σ2 C=/parenleftbigg83.8 72.4/parenrightbigg2 =1.34 One is free to deﬁne factor of safety as SC/σC. Awkwardness comes when one compares the factor of safety in bending fatigue with the factor of safety in surface fatigue for a particular gear. Suppose the factor of safety of this gear in bending fatigue is 1.20 and the factor of safety in surface fatigue is 1.34 as above. The threat, since 1.34 is greater than 1.20, is in bending fatigue since both numbers are based on load ratios. If the fac- tor of safety in surface fatigue is based on SC/σC=√ 1.34=1.16, then 1.20 is greater than 1.16, but the threat is not from surface fatigue. The surface fatigue factor of safety can be deﬁned either way. One way has the burden of requiring a squared number before numbers that instinctively seem comparable can be compared. In addition to the dynamic factor Kvalready introduced, there are transmitted load excursions, nonuniform distribution of the transmitted load over the tooth contact, and the inﬂuence of rim thickness on bending stress. Tabulated strength values can be means, ASTM minimums, or of unknown heritage. In surface fatigue there are no endurance lim- its. Endurance strengths have to be qualiﬁed as to corresponding cycle count, and the slope of the S-Ncurve needs to be known. In bending fatigue there is a deﬁnite change in slope of the S-Ncurve near 106cycles, but some evidence indicates that an endurance limit does not exist. Gearing experience leads to cycle counts of 1011or more. Evidence of dimin- ishing endurance strengths in bending have been included in AGMA methodology. 14–3 AGMA Stress Equations Two fundamental stress equations are used in the AGMA methodology, one for bend- ing stress and another for pitting resistance (contact stress). In AGMA terminology, these are called stress numbers, as contrasted with actual applied stresses, and arebud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/18/09 3:25 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:746 Mechanical Engineering Design designated by a lowercase letter sinstead of the Greek lower case σwe have used in this book (and shall continue to use).

It will be less confusing here if we con- tinue the practice in this book of using the uppercase letter Sto designate strength and the lowercase Greek letters σandτfor stress. To make it perfectly clear we shall use the term gear strength as a replacement for the phrase allowable stress numbers as used by AGMA. Following this convention, values for gear bending strength, designated here as St, are to be found in Figs. 14–2, 14–3, and 14–4, and in Tables 14–3 and 14–4. Since gear strengths are not identiﬁed with other strengths such as Sut, Se, or Syas used elsewhere in this book, their use should be restricted to gear problems. In this approach the strengths are modiﬁed by various factors that produce limiting values of the bending stress and the contact stress.

The factors in this section, too, will be evaluated in subsequent sections. When two-way (reversed) loading occurs, as with idler gears, AGMA recommends using 70 percent of Stvalues.

The AGMA factors5Iand Jare intended to accom- plish the same purpose in a more involved manner. The determination of Iand Jdepends upon the face-contact ratio mF.

Low-contact-ratio (LCR) helical gears having a small helix angle or a thin face width, or both, have face-contact ratios less than unity ( mF≤1), and will not be con- sidered here. Such gears have a noise level not too different from that for spur gears. Consequently we shall consider here only spur gears with mF=0and conventional helical gears with mF>1. Bending-Strength Geometry Factor J(YJ) The AGMA factor Jemploys a modiﬁed value of the Lewis form factor, also denoted byY; a fatigue stress-concentration factor Kf; and a tooth load-sharing ratio mN. The resulting equation for Jfor spur and helical gears is J=Y KfmN(14–20) It is important to note that the form factor Yin Eq. (14–20) is notthe Lewis factor at all. The value of Yhere is obtained from calculations within AGMA 908-B89, and is often based on the highest point of single-tooth contact.bud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/18/09 3:25 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Spur and Helical Gears 753 12 15 17 20 24 30 35 40 45 50 60 80 125 275 ∞0.200.250.300.35 0.200.250.300.350.400.450.500.550.60 Generating rack 1 pitch0.35 rTAddendum 1.000 2.400 Whole depth 20°Pinion addendum 1.000 Gear addendum 1.000 0.400.450.500.550.60 1000 170 85 50 35 25 17 Number of teeth in mating gear Load applied at highest point of single-tooth contact Load applied at tip of tooth Number of teeth for which geometry factor is desiredGeometry factor JThe factor Kfin Eq. (14–20) is called a stress-correction factor by AGMA. It is based on a formula deduced from a photoelastic investigation of stress concentration in gear teeth over 50 years ago. The load-sharing ratio mNis equal to the face width divided by the minimum total length of the lines of contact. This factor depends on the transverse contact ratio mp, the face-contact ratio mF, the effects of any proﬁle modiﬁcations, and the tooth deﬂec- tion. For spur gears, mN=1.0. For helical gears having a face-contact ratio mF>2.0, a conservative approximation is given by the equation mN=pN 0.95Z(14–21) where pNis the normal base pitch and Zis the length of the line of action in the trans- verse plane (distance Labin Fig. 13–15). Use Fig. 14–6 to obtain the geometry factor Jfor spur gears having a 20◦pressure angle and full-depth teeth. Use Figs. 14–7 and 14–8 for helical gears having a 20◦normal pressure angle and face-contact ratios of mF=2or greater. For other gears, consult the AGMA standard.

ANSI/AGMA 2001-D04, adopted in 2004, replaced Qvwith Avand incorporated ANSI/AGMA 2015-1-A01. Avranges from 6 to 12, with lower numbers representing greater accuracy. The Qvapproach was maintained as an alternate approach, and resulting Kvvalues are comparable.Certain precautions must be taken in using Eq. (14–25). The tooth proﬁles are not con- jugate below the base circle, and consequently, if either one or the other of the ﬁrst two terms in brackets is larger than the third term, then it should be replaced by the third term. In addition, the effective outside radius is sometimes less than r+a, owing to removal of burrs or rounding of the tips of the teeth. When this is the case, always use the effective outside radius instead of r+a. 14–6 The Elastic Coefﬁcient Cp(ZE) Values of Cpmay be computed directly from Eq. (14–13) or obtained from Table 14–8. 14–7 Dynamic Factor Kv As noted earlier, dynamic factors are used to account for inaccuracies in the manufac- ture and meshing of gear teeth in action. Transmission error is deﬁned as the departure from uniform angular velocity of the gear pair. Some of the effects that produce trans- mission error are: •Inaccuracies produced in the generation of the tooth proﬁle; these include errors in tooth spacing, proﬁle lead, and runout •Vibration of the tooth during meshing due to the tooth stiffness •Magnitude of the pitch-line velocity •Dynamic unbalance of the rotating members •Wear and permanent deformation of contacting portions of the teeth •Gearshaft misalignment and the linear and angular deﬂection of the shaft •Tooth friction In an attempt to account for these effects, AGMA has deﬁned a set of quality num- bers.7These numbers deﬁne the tolerances for gears of various sizes manufactured to a speciﬁed accuracy. Quality numbers 3 to 7 will include most commercial-quality gears. Quality numbers 8 to 12 are of precision quality. The AGMA transmission accuracy- level number Qvcould be taken as the same as the quality number. The following equa- tions for the dynamic factor are based on these Qvnumbers: Kv=⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩/parenleftBigg A+√ V A/parenrightBiggB Vin ft/min /parenleftBigg A+√ 200V A/parenrightBiggB Vin m/s(14–27) where A=50+56(1−B) B=0.25(12−Qv)2/3(14–28) and the maximum velocity, representing the end point of the Qvcurve, is given by (Vt)max=⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩[A+(Qv−3)]2ft/min [A+(Qv−3)]2 200m/s(14–29)bud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/18/09 3:25 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Table 14–8 Elastic Coefﬁcient Cp(ZE), √psi(√ MPa)Source: AGMA 218.01 Gear Material and Modulus of Elasticity EG, lbf/in2(MPa)* Malleable Nodular Cast Aluminum Tin Pinion Modulus of Steel Iron Iron Iron Bronze Bronze Pinion Elasticity Ep 30 /H1154710625 /H1154710624 /H1154710622 /H1154710617.5 /H1154710616 /H11547106 Material psi (MPa)* (2 /H11547105) (1.7 /H11547105) (1.7 /H11547105) (1.5 /H11547105) (1.2 /H11547105) (1.1 /H11547105) Steel 30 ×1062300 2180 2160 2100 1950 1900 (2 ×105) (191) (181) (179) (174) (162) (158) Malleable iron 25 ×1062180 2090 2070 2020 1900 1850 (1.7 ×105) (181) (174) (172) (168) (158) (154) Nodular iron 24 ×1062160 2070 2050 2000 1880 1830 (1.7 ×105) (179) (172) (170) (166) (156) (152) Cast iron 22 ×1062100 2020 2000 1960 1850 1800 (1.5 ×105) (174) (168) (166) (163) (154) (149) Aluminum bronze 17.5 ×1061950 1900 1880 1850 1750 1700 (1.2 ×105) (162) (158) (156) (154) (145) (141) Tin bronze 16 ×1061900 1850 1830 1800 1700 1650 (1.1 ×105) (158) (154) (152) (149) (141) (137) Poisson’s ratio /H110050.30. ∗When more exact values for modulus of elasticity are obtained from roller contact tests, they may be used. 757bud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/21/09 5:13 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:758 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 14–9 Dynamic factor Kv.

Examples include variations in torque from the mean value due to ﬁring of cylin- ders in an internal combustion engine or reaction to torque variations in a piston pump drive. There are other similar factors such as application factor or service factor. These factors are established after considerable ﬁeld experience in a particular application.8 14–9 Surface Condition Factor Cf(ZR) The surface condition factor Cfor ZRis used only in the pitting resistance equation, Eq. (14–16). It depends on •Surface ﬁnish as affected by, but not limited to, cutting, shaving, lapping, grinding, shotpeening •Residual stress •Plastic effects (work hardening) Standard surface conditions for gear teeth have not yet been established. When a detri- mental surface ﬁnish effect is known to exist, AGMA speciﬁes a value of Cfgreater than unity. 8An extensive list of service factors appears in Howard B. Schwerdlin, “Couplings,” Chap. 16 in Joseph E. Shigley, Charles R. Mischke, and Thomas H. Brown, Jr. (eds.), Standard Handbook of Machine Design, 3rd ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 2004.bud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/18/09 3:25 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Spur and Helical Gears 759 14–10 Size Factor Ks The size factor reﬂects nonuniformity of material properties due to size. It depends upon •Tooth size •Diameter of part •Ratio of tooth size to diameter of part •Face width •Area of stress pattern •Ratio of case depth to tooth size •Hardenability and heat treatment Standard size factors for gear teeth have not yet been established for cases where there is a detrimental size effect. In such cases AGMA recommends a size factor greater than unity. If there is no detrimental size effect, use unity. AGMA has identified and provided a symbol for size factor. Also, AGMA suggests Ks=1, which makes Ksa placeholder in Eqs. (14–15) and (14–16) until more information is gathered. Following the standard in this manner is a failure to apply all of your knowledge. From Table 13–1, l=a+b=2.25/P. The tooth thick- ness tin Fig. 14–6 is given in Sec. 14–1, Eq.

You may set Ks=1, or you may elect to use the preceding Eq. ( a). This is a point to discuss with your instructor. We will use Eq. ( a) to remind you that you have a choice. If Ksin Eq. ( a) is less than 1, use Ks=1. 14–11 Load-Distribution Factor Km(KH) The load-distribution factor modiﬁed the stress equations to reﬂect nonuniform distribu- tion of load across the line of contact. The ideal is to locate the gear “midspan” between two bearings at the zero slope place when the load is applied. However, this is not always possible. The following procedure is applicable to •Net face width to pinion pitch diameter ratio F/d≤2 •Gear elements mounted between the bearings •Face widths up to 40 in •Contact, when loaded, across the full width of the narrowest member The load-distribution factor under these conditions is currently given by the face load distribution factor, Cmf, where Km=Cmf=1+Cmc(CpfCpm+CmaCe) (14–30)bud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/18/09 3:25 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:760 Mechanical Engineering Design 760 Mechanical Engineering Design where Cmc=/braceleftbigg1 for uncrowned teeth 0.8 for crowned teeth(14–31) Cpf=⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩F 10d−0.025 F≤1i n F 10d−0.0375+0.0125 F 1<F≤17 in F 10d−0.1109+0.0207 F−0.000 228 F217<F≤40 in(14–32) Note that for values of F/(10d)<0.05, F/(10d)=0.05is used.

If both the pinion and the gear are through-hardened, then a uniform surface strength can be obtained by making the pinion harder than the gear. A similar effect can be obtained when a surface-hardened pinion is mated with a through- hardened gear. The hardness-ratio factor CHis used only for the gear . Its purpose is to adjust the surface strengths for this effect. The values of CHare obtained from the equation CH=1.0+A/prime(mG−1.0) (14–36) where A/prime=8.98(10−3)/parenleftbiggHBP HBG/parenrightbigg −8.29(10−3)1.2≤HBP HBG≤1.7 The terms HBPand HBGare the Brinell hardness (10-mm ball at 3000-kg load) of the pinion and gear, respectively. The term mGis the speed ratio and is given by Eq. (14–22). See Fig. 14–12 for a graph of Eq. (14–36). For HBP HBG<1.2,A/prime=0 HBP HBG>1.7,A/prime=0.006 98 When surface-hardened pinions with hardnesses of 48 Rockwell C scale (Rockwell C48) or harder are run with through-hardened gears (180–400 Brinell), a work harden- ing occurs.

The purpose of the load cycle factors YNand ZN is to modify the gear strength for lives other than 107cycles. Values for these factors are given in Figs. 14–14 and 14–15. Note that for 107cycles YN=ZN=1on each graph. Note also that the equations for YNand ZNchange on either side of 107cycles. For life goals slightly higher than 107cycles, the mating gear may be experiencing fewer than 107cycles and the equations for (YN)Pand (YN)Gcan be different.

The deﬁnition of SF, from Eq. (14–17), is SF=StYN/(KTKR) σ=fully corrected bending strength bending stress(14–41) where σis estimated from Eq. (14–15). It is a strength-over-stress deﬁnition in a case where the stress is linear with the transmitted load. The deﬁnition of SH, from Eq. (14–18), is SH=ScZNCH/(KTKR) σc=fully corrected contact strength contact stress(14–42) when σcis estimated from Eq. (14–16). This, too, is a strength-over-stress deﬁnition but in a case where the stress is notlinear with the transmitted load Wt. While the deﬁnition of SHdoes not interfere with its intended function, a caution is required when comparing SFwith SHin an analysis in order to ascertain the nature and severity of the threat to loss of function. To render SHlinear with the transmitted load, Wtit could have been deﬁned as SH=/parenleftbiggfully corrected contact strength contact stress imposed/parenrightbigg2 (14–43) with the exponent 2 for linear or helical contact, or an exponent of 3 for crowned teeth (spherical contact). With the definition, Eq. (14–42), compare SFwith S2 H (orS3 Hfor crowned teeth) when trying to identify the threat to loss of function with confidence. The role of the overload factor Kois to include predictable excursions of load beyond Wtbased on experience. A safety factor is intended to account for unquantiﬁable ele- ments in addition to Ko. When designing a gear mesh, the quantity SFbecomes a design factor (SF)dwithin the meanings used in this book. The quantity SFevaluated as part of a design assessment is a factor of safety. This applies equally well to the quantity SH. 14–18 Analysis Description of the procedure based on the AGMA standard is highly detailed. The best review is a “road map” for bending fatigue and contact-stress fatigue. Figure 14–17 identiﬁes the bending stress equation, the endurance strength in bending equation, and the factor of safety SF. Figure 14–18 displays the contact-stress equation, the contact fatigue endurance strength equation, and the factor of safety SH. When analyzing a gear problem, this ﬁgure is a useful reference. The following example of a gear mesh analysis is intended to make all the details presented concerning the AGMA method more familiar.bud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/18/09 3:25 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:766 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 14–17 Roadmap of gear bending equations based on AGMA standards.

The diametral pitch is 10 teeth/in, the face width 1.5 in, and the quality standard is No. 6. The gears are straddle-mounted with bearings immediately adjacent. The pinion is a grade 1 steel with a hardness of 240 Brinell tooth surface and through-hardened core. The gear is steel, through-hardened also, grade 1 material, with a Brinell hardness of 200, tooth surface and core. Poisson’s ratio is 0.30, JP=0.30, JG=0.40, and Young’s modulus is 30(106)psi. The loading is smooth because of motor and load. Assume a pinion life of 108cycles and a reliability of 0.90, and use YN=1.3558 N−0.0178, ZN=1.4488 N−0.023. The tooth proﬁle is uncrowned.

The load cycle factors given in the problem state- ment, with N(pinion) =108cycles and N(gear) =108/mG=108/3.059cycles, are (YN)P=1.3558(108)−0.0178=0.977 (YN)G=1.3558(108/3.059)−0.0178=0.996 From Table 14.10, with a reliability of 0.9, KR=0.85.From Fig. 14–18, the tempera- ture and surface condition factors are KT=1andCf=1.

From Table 14–3, for grade 1 steel with HBP=240and HBG=200, we use Fig. 14–2, which gives (St)P=77.3(240)+12 800 =31 350 psi (St)G=77.3(200)+12 800 =28 260 psi Similarly, from Table 14–6, we use Fig. 14–5, which gives (Sc)P=322(240)+29 100 =106 400 psi (Sc)G=322(200)+29 100 =93 500 psi From Fig. 14–15, (ZN)P=1.4488(108)−0.023=0.948 (ZN)G=1.4488(108/3.059)−0.023=0.973 For the hardness ratio factor CH, the hardness ratio is HBP/HBG=240/200=1.2. Then, from Sec. 14–12, A/prime=8.98(10−3)(HBP/HBG)−8.29(10−3) =8.98(10−3)(1.2)−8.29(10−3)=0.002 49 Thus, from Eq.

For the gear, we compare ( SF)Gwith (SH)2 G, or 6.96 with 1.522=2.31, so the threat in the gear is also from wear. There are perspectives to be gained from Ex. 14–4. First, the pinion is overly strong in bending compared to wear. The performance in wear can be improved by surface- hardening techniques, such as ﬂame or induction hardening, nitriding, or carburizing and case hardening, as well as shot peening. This in turn permits the gearset to be madebud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/18/09 3:25 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Spur and Helical Gears 771 Spur and Helical Gears 771 smaller. Second, in bending, the gear is stronger than the pinion, indicating that both the gear core hardness and tooth size could be reduced; that is, we may increase Pand reduce diameter of the gears, or perhaps allow a cheaper material. Third, in wear, surface strength equations have the ratio (ZN)/KR. The values of (ZN)Pand (ZN)Gare affected by gear ratio mG. The designer can control strength by specifying surface hardness. This point will be elaborated later. Having followed a spur-gear analysis in detail in Ex. 14–4, it is timely to analyze a helical gearset under similar circumstances to observe similarities and differences. EXAMPLE 14–5 A 17-tooth 20◦normal pitch-angle helical pinion with a right-hand helix angle of 30◦ rotates at 1800 rev/min when transmitting 4 hp to a 52-tooth helical gear. The normal diametral pitch is 10 teeth/in, the face width is 1.5 in, and the set has a quality number of 6. The gears are straddle-mounted with bearings immediately adjacent. The pinion and gear are made from a through-hardened steel with surface and core hardnesses of 240 Brinell on the pinion and surface and core hardnesses of 200 Brinell on the gear. The transmission is smooth, connecting an electric motor and a centrifugal pump. Assume a pinion life of 108cycles and a reliability of 0.9 and use the upper curves in Figs. 14–14 and 14–15. (a) Find the factors of safety of the gears in bending. (b) Find the factors of safety of the gears in wear. (c) By examining the factors of safety identify the threat to each gear and to the mesh. Solution All of the parameters in this example are the same as in Ex. 14–4 with the exception that we are using helical gears. Thus, several terms will be the same as Ex. 14–4. The reader should verify that the following terms remain unchanged: Ko=1,YP=0.303,YG=0.412, mG=3.059,(Ks)P=1.043,(Ks)G=1.052,(YN)P=0.977,(YN)G=0.996, KR=0.85, KT=1,Cf=1,Cp=2300√psi,(St)P=31 350 psi,(St)G=28 260 psi, (Sc)P= 106 380 psi,(Sc)G=93 500 psi,(ZN)P=0.948,(ZN)G=0.973, and CH=1.005. For helical gears, the transverse diametral pitch, given by Eq. (13–18), is Pt=Pncosψ=10 cos 30◦=8.660 teeth/in Thus, the pitch diameters are dP=NP/Pt=17/8.660=1.963in and dG=52/8.660= 6.005in.

For the gear we compare SFwith S2 H, or 11.9 with 2.222=4.93, so the threat is also from wear in the gear. For the meshing gearset wear controls. It is worthwhile to compare Ex. 14–4 with Ex. 14–5. The spur and helical gearsets were placed in nearly identical circumstances. The helical gear teeth are of greater length because of the helix and identical face widths. The pitch diameters of the helical gears are larger. The Jfactors and the Ifactor are larger, thereby reducing stresses. The result is larger factors of safety. In the design phase the gearsets in Ex. 14–4 and Ex. 14–5 can be made smaller with control of materials and relative hardnesses.bud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/18/09 3:25 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:774 Mechanical Engineering Design 774 Mechanical Engineering Design Now that examples have given the AGMA parameters substance, it is time to exam- ine some desirable (and necessary) relationships between material properties of spur gears in mesh.

The steps, after the a priori decisions have been made are •Choose a diametral pitch. •Examine implications on face width, pitch diameters, and material properties. If not satisfactory, return to pitch decision for change. •Choose a pinion material and examine core and case hardness requirements. If not satisfactory, return to pitch decision and iterate until no decisions are changed. •Choose a gear material and examine core and case hardness requirements. If not satisfactory, return to pitch decision and iterate until no decisions are changed. With these plan steps in mind, we can consider them in more detail. First select a trial diametral pitch. Pinion bending: •Select a median face width for this pitch, 4π/P •Find the range of necessary ultimate strengths •Choose a material and a core hardness •Find face width to meet factor of safety in bending •Choose face width •Check factor of safety in bending Gear bending: •Find necessary companion core hardness •Choose a material and core hardness •Check factor of safety in bending Pinion wear: •Find necessary Scand attendant case hardness •Choose a case hardness •Check factor of safety in wear Gear wear: •Find companion case hardness •Choose a case hardness •Check factor of safety in wear Completing this set of steps will yield a satisfactory design. Additional designs with diametral pitches adjacent to the ﬁrst satisfactory design will produce several among which to choose. A ﬁgure of merit is necessary in order to choose the best. Unfortunately, a ﬁgure of merit in gear design is complex in an academic environment because material and processing cost vary. The possibility of using a process depends on the manufacturing facility if gears are made in house. After examining Ex. 14–4 and Ex. 14–5 and seeing the wide range of factors of safety, one might entertain the notion of setting all factors of safety equal.9In steel 9In designing gears it makes sense to deﬁne the factor of safety in wear as (S)2 Hfor uncrowned teeth, so that there is no mix-up. ANSI, in the preface to ANSI/AGMA 2001-D04 and 2101-D04, states “the use is com- pletely voluntary ...does not preclude anyone from using ...procedures ...not conforming to the standards.”bud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/21/09 5:13 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Spur and Helical Gears 777 Spur and Helical Gears 777 gears, wear is usually controlling and (SH)Pand(SH)Gcan be brought close to equal- ity. The use of softer cores can bring down (SF)Pand(SF)G, but there is value in keep- ing them higher. A tooth broken by bending fatigue not only can destroy the gear set, but can bend shafts, damage bearings, and produce inertial stresses up- and downstream in the power train, causing damage elsewhere if the gear box locks. EXAMPLE 14–8 Design a 4:1 spur-gear reduction for a 100-hp, three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor running at 1120 rev/min. The load is smooth, providing a reliability of 0.95 at 109revolutions of the pinion. Gearing space is meager. Use Nitralloy 135M, grade 1 mate- rial to keep the gear size small. The gears are heat-treated ﬁrst then nitrided.

Van Gerpen, C. K. Reece, and J. K. Jensen, Computer Aided Design of Custom Gears, Van Gerpen–Reece Engineering, Cedar Falls, Iowa, 1996.This design example showed a satisfactory design for a four-pitch spur-gear mesh. Material could be changed, as could pitch. There are a number of other satisfactory designs, thus a ﬁgure of merit is needed to identify the best. One can appreciate that gear design was one of the early applications of the digital computer to mechanical engineering. A design program should be interactive, present- ing results of calculations, pausing for a decision by the designer, and showing the con- sequences of the decision, with a loop back to change a decision for the better. The program can be structured in totem-pole fashion, with the most inﬂuential decision at the top, then tumbling down, decision after decision, ending with the ability to change the current decision or to begin again. Such a program would make a ﬁne class project. Troubleshooting the coding will reinforce your knowledge, adding ﬂexibility as well as bells and whistles in subsequent terms. Standard gears may not be the most economical design that meets the functional requirements, because no application is standard in all respects.10Methods of design- ing custom gears are well understood and frequently used in mobile equipment to provide good weight-to-performance index. The required calculations including opti- mizations are within the capability of a personal computer. PROBLEMS Problems marked with an asterisk (*) are linked to problems in other chapters, as summarized in Table 1–1 of Sec. 1–16, p. 24. Because gearing problems can be difﬁcult, the problems are presented by section. Section 14–1 14–1 A steel spur pinion has a pitch of 6 teeth/in, 22 full-depth teeth, and a 20◦pressure angle. The pinion runs at a speed of 1200 rev/min and transmits 15 hp to a 60-tooth gear.

Determine a suitable face width based on an allowable bending stress of 150 MPa. 14–6 A20◦full-depth steel spur pinion has 20 teeth and a module of 2 mm and is to transmit 0.5 kW at a speed of 200 rev/min. Find an appropriate face width if the bending stress is not to exceed 75 MPa. 14–7 A20◦full-depth steel spur pinion has a diametral pitch of 5 teeth/in and 24 teeth and transmits 6 hp at a speed of 50 rev/min. Find an appropriate face width if the allowable bending stress is 20 kpsi. 14–8 A steel spur pinion is to transmit 20 hp at a speed of 400 rev/min. The pinion is cut on the 20◦ full-depth system and has a diametral pitch of 4 teeth/in and 16 teeth. Find a suitable face width based on an allowable stress of 12 kpsi. 14–9 A 20◦full-depth steel spur pinion with 18 teeth is to transmit 2.5 hp at a speed of 600 rev/min. Determine appropriate values for the face width and diametral pitch based on an allowable bend- ing stress of 10 kpsi. 14–10 A 20◦full-depth steel spur pinion is to transmit 1.5 kW hp at a speed of 900 rev/min. If the pin- ion has 18 teeth, determine suitable values for the module and face width. The bending stress should not exceed 75 MPa. Section 14–2 14–11 A speed reducer has 20◦full-depth teeth and consists of a 20-tooth steel spur pinion driving a 50-tooth cast-iron gear. The horsepower transmitted is 12 at a pinion speed of 1200 rev/min. For a diametral pitch of 8 teeth/in and a face width of 1.5 in, ﬁnd the contact stress. 14–12 A gear drive consists of a 16-tooth 20◦steel spur pinion and a 48-tooth cast-iron gear having a pitch of 12 teeth/in. For a power input of 1.5 hp at a pinion speed of 700 rev/min, select a face width based on an allowable contact stress of 100 kpsi. 14–13 A gearset has a module of 5 mm, a 20◦pressure angle, and a 24-tooth cast-iron spur pinion driving a 48-tooth cast-iron gear. The pinion is to rotate at 50 rev/min. What horsepower input can be used with this gearset if the contact stress is limited to 690 MPa and F=60mm? 14–14 A 20◦20-tooth cast-iron spur pinion having a module of 4 mm drives a 32-tooth cast-iron gear. Find the contact stress if the pinion speed is 1000 rev/min, the face width is 50 mm, and 10 kW of power is transmitted. 14–15 A steel spur pinion and gear have a diametral pitch of 12 teeth/in, milled teeth, 17 and 30 teeth, respectively, a 20◦pressure angle, and a pinion speed of 525 rev/min. The tooth properties are Sut=76kpsi, Sy=42kpsi and the Brinell hardness is 149. For a design factor of 2.25, a face width of 7 8in, what is the power rating of the gearset? 14–16 A milled-teeth steel pinion and gear pair have Sut=113kpsi, Sy=86kpsi and a hardness at the involute surface of 262 Brinell. The diametral pitch is 3 teeth/in, the face width is 2.5 in, and the pinion speed is 870 rev/min. The tooth counts are 20 and 100. For a design factor of 1.5, rate the gearset for power considering both bending and wear. 14–17 A 20◦full-depth steel spur pinion rotates at 1145 rev/min. It has a module of 6 mm, a face width of 75 mm, and 16 milled teeth. The ultimate tensile strength at the involute is 900 MPa exhibit- ing a Brinell hardness of 260. The gear is steel with 30 teeth and has identical material strengths. For a design factor of 1.3 ﬁnd the power rating of the gearset based on the pinion and the gear resisting bending and wear fatigue.bud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/21/09 5:14 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:782 Mechanical Engineering Design 782 Mechanical Engineering Design 14–18 A steel spur pinion has a pitch of 6 teeth/in, 17 full-depth milled teeth, and a pressure angle of 20◦. The pinion has an ultimate tensile strength at the involute surface of 116 kpsi, a Brinell hardness of 232, and a yield strength of 90 kpsi. Its shaft speed is 1120 rev/min, its face width is 2 in, and its mating gear has 51 teeth. Rate the pinion for power transmission if the design factor is 2. (a) Pinion bending fatigue imposes what power limitation? (b) Pinion surface fatigue imposes what power limitation? The gear has identical strengths to the pinion with regard to material properties. (c) Consider power limitations due to gear bending and wear. (d) Rate the gearset. Section 14–3 to 14–19 14–19 A commercial enclosed gear drive consists of a 20◦spur pinion having 16 teeth driving a 48-tooth gear. The pinion speed is 300 rev/min, the face width 2 in, and the diametral pitch 6 teeth/in. The gears are grade 1 steel, through-hardened at 200 Brinell, made to No. 6 quality standards, uncrowned, and are to be accurately and rigidly mounted. Assume a pinion life of 108cycles and a reliability of 0.90. Determine the AGMA bending and contact stresses and the corresponding factors of safety if 5 hp is to be transmitted. 14–20 A 20◦spur pinion with 20 teeth and a module of 2.5 mm transmits 120 W to a 36-tooth gear. The pinion speed is 100 rev/min, and the gears are grade 1, 18-mm face width, through-hardened steel at 200 Brinell, uncrowned, manufactured to a No. 6 quality standard, and considered to be of open gearing quality installation. Find the AGMA bending and contact stresses and the corre- sponding factors of safety for a pinion life of 108cycles and a reliability of 0.95. 14–21 Repeat Prob. 14–19 using helical gears each with a 20◦normal pitch angle and a helix angle of30◦and a normal diametral pitch of 6 teeth/in. 14–22 A spur gearset has 17 teeth on the pinion and 51 teeth on the gear. The pressure angle is 20◦and the overload factor Ko=1. The diametral pitch is 6 teeth/in and the face width is 2 in. The pin- ion speed is 1120 rev/min and its cycle life is to be 108revolutions at a reliability R=0.99. The quality number is 5. The material is a through-hardened steel, grade 1, with Brinell hardnesses of 232 core and case of both gears. For a design factor of 2, rate the gearset for these conditions using the AGMA method. 14–23 In Sec. 14–10, Eq. ( a) is given for Ksbased on the procedure in Ex. 14–2. Derive this equation. 14–24 A speed-reducer has 20◦full-depth teeth, and the single-reduction spur-gear gearset has 22 and 60 teeth. The diametral pitch is 4 teeth/in and the face width is 31 4in. The pinion shaft speed is 1145 rev/min. The life goal of 5-year 24-hour-per-day service is about 3(109)pinion revolutions. The absolute value of the pitch variation is such that the transmission accuracy level number is 6. The materials are 4340 through-hardened grade 1 steels, heat-treated to 250 Brinell, core and case, both gears. The load is moderate shock and the power is smooth. For a reliability of 0.99, rate the speed reducer for power. 14–25 The speed reducer of Prob. 14–24 is to be used for an application requiring 40 hp at 1145 rev/min. Estimate the stresses of pinion bending, gear bending, pinion wear, and gear wear and the attendant AGMA factors of safety (SF)P, (SF)G, (SH)P, and (SH)G. For the reducer, what is the factor of safety for unquantiﬁable exingencies in Wt? What mode of failure is the most threatening? 14–26 The gearset of Prob. 14–24 needs improvement of wear capacity. Toward this end the gears are nitrided so that the grade 1 materials have hardnesses as follows: The pinion core is 250 and thebud29281_ch14_733-784.qxd 12/18/09 3:25 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:pinion case hardness is 390 Brinell, and the gear core hardness is 250 core and 390 case. Estimate the power rating for the new gearset. 14–27 The gearset of Prob. 14–24 has had its gear speciﬁcation changed to 9310 for carburizing and surface hardening with the result that the pinion Brinell hardnesses are 285 core and 580–600 case, and the gear hardnesses are 285 core and 580–600 case. Estimate the power rating for the new gearset. 14–28 The gearset of Prob. 14–27 is going to be upgraded in material to a quality of grade 2 (9310) steel. Estimate the power rating for the new gearset. 14–29 Matters of scale always improve insight and perspective. Reduce the physical size of the gearset in Prob. 14–24 by one-half and note the result on the estimates of transmitted load Wtand power. 14–30 AGMA procedures with cast-iron gear pairs differ from those with steels because life predictions are difﬁcult; consequently (YN)P, (YN)G, (ZN)P, and (ZN)Gare set to unity. The consequence of this is that the fatigue strengths of the pinion and gear materials are the same. The reliability is 0.99 and the life is 107revolution of the pinion (KR=1). For longer lives the reducer is der- ated in power. For the pinion and gear set of Prob. 14–24, use grade 40 cast iron for both gears (HB=201Brinell). Rate the reducer for power with SFand SHequal to unity. 14–31 Spur-gear teeth have rolling and slipping contact (often about 8 percent slip). Spur gears tested to wear failure are reported at 108cycles as Buckingham’s surface fatigue load-stress factor K. This factor is related to Hertzian contact strength SCby SC=/radicalBigg 1.4K (1/E1+1/E2)sinφ where φis the normal pressure angle. Cast iron grade 20 gears with φ=141 2◦and 20◦pressure angle exhibit a minimum Kof 81 and 112 psi, respectively. How does this compare with SC= 0.32HBkpsi? 14–32 You’ve probably noticed that although the AGMA method is based on two equations, the details of assembling all the factors is computationally intensive. To reduce error and omissions, a com- puter program would be useful. Write a program to perform a power rating of an existing gearset, then use Prob. 14–24, 14–26, 14–27, 14–28, and 14–29 to test your program by comparing the results to your longhand solutions. 14–33 In Ex. 14–5 use nitrided grade 1 steel (4140) which produces Brinell hardnesses of 250 core and 500 at the surface (case). Use the upper fatigue curves on Figs. 14–14 and 14–15. Estimate the power capacity of the mesh with factors of safety of SF=SH=1. 14–34 In Ex. 14–5 use carburized and case-hardened gears of grade 1. Carburizing and case-hardening can produce a 550 Brinell case. The core hardnesses are 200 Brinell. Estimate the power capacity of the mesh with factors of safety of SF=SH=1, using the lower fatigue curves in Figs. 14–14 and 14–15. 14–35 In Ex. 14–5, use carburized and case-hardened gears of grade 2 steel. The core hardnesses are 200, and surface hardnesses are 600 Brinell. Use the lower fatigue curves of Figs. 14–14 and 14–15. Estimate the power capacity of the mesh using SF=SH=1. Compare the power capacity with the results of Prob. 14–34. 14–36* The countershaft in Prob. 3–72, p. 138, is part of a speed reducing compound gear train using 20◦ spur gears. A gear on the input shaft drives gear A.Gear Bdrives a gear on the output shaft. The input shaft runs at 2400 rev/min.

All gears are to be of the same material. Since gear Bis the smallest gear, trans- mitting the largest load, it will likely be critical, so a preliminary analysis is to be performed on it. Use a diametral pitch of 2 teeth/in, a face-width of 4 times the circular pitch, a Grade 2 steel through-hardened to a Brinell hardness of 300, and a desired life of 15 kh with a 95 percent reliability. Determine factors of safety for bending and wear. 14–37* The countershaft in Prob. 3–73, p. 138, is part of a speed reducing compound gear train using 20◦ spur gears. A gear on the input shaft drives gear Awith a 2 to 1 speed reduction. Gear Bdrives a gear on the output shaft with a 5 to 1 speed reduction. The input shaft runs at 1800 rev/min. All gears are to be of the same material. Since gear Bis the smallest gear, transmitting the largest load, it will likely be critical, so a preliminary analysis is to be performed on it.

Chapter 14 was an introduction to the AGMA methods for spur and helical gears. AGMA has estab- lished similar methods for other types of gearing, which all follow the same general approach. 15–1 Bevel Gearing—General Bevel gears may be classiﬁed as follows: •Straight bevel gears •Spiral bevel gears •Zerol bevel gears •Hypoid gears •Spiroid gears A straight bevel gear was illustrated in Fig. 13–35. These gears are usually used for pitch-line velocities up to 1000 ft/min (5 m/s) when the noise level is not an important consideration. They are available in many stock sizes and are less expensive to produce than other bevel gears, especially in small quantities. A spiral bevel gear is shown in Fig. 15–1; the deﬁnition of the spiral angle is illus- trated in Fig. 15–2. These gears are recommended for higher speeds and where the noise level is an important consideration. Spiral bevel gears are the bevel counterpart of the helical gear; it can be seen in Fig. 15–1 that the pitch surfaces and the nature of con- tact are the same as for straight bevel gears except for the differences brought about by the spiral-shaped teeth. The Zerol bevel gear is a patented gear having curved teeth but with a zero spiral angle. The axial thrust loads permissible for Zerol bevel gears are not as large as those for the spiral bevel gear, and so they are often used instead of straight bevel gears. The Zerol bevel gear is generated by the same tool used for regular spiral bevel gears. For design purposes, use the same procedure as for straight bevel gears and then simply substitute a Zerol bevel gear. Figure 15–1 Spiral bevel gears.

Figure 15–3 Hypoid gears. (Courtesy of Gleason Works, Rochester, N.Y.) It is frequently desirable, as in the case of automotive differential applications, to have gearing similar to bevel gears but with the shafts offset. Such gears are called hypoid gears, because their pitch surfaces are hyperboloids of revolution. The tooth action between such gears is a combination of rolling and sliding along a straight line and has much in common with that of worm gears. Figure 15–3 shows a pair of hypoid gears in mesh. Figure 15–4 is included to assist in the classiﬁcation of spiral bevel gearing. It is seen that the hypoid gear has a relatively small shaft offset. For larger offsets, the pinion begins to resemble a tapered worm and the set is then called spiroid gearing .bud29281_ch15_785-824.qxd 12/18/09 5:49 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:788 Mechanical Engineering Design Worm Spiroid Hypoid Spiral bevelRing gearFigure 15–4 Comparison of intersecting- and offset-shaft bevel-type gearings. (From Gear Handbook by Darle W. Dudley, 1962, pp. 2–24.) 15–2 Bevel-Gear Stresses and Strengths In a typical bevel-gear mounting, Fig. 13–36, for example, one of the gears is often mounted outboard of the bearings. This means that the shaft deﬂections can be more pronounced and can have a greater effect on the nature of the tooth contact. Another dif- ﬁculty that occurs in predicting the stress in bevel-gear teeth is the fact that the teeth are tapered. Thus, to achieve perfect line contact passing through the cone center, the teeth ought to bend more at the large end than at the small end. To obtain this condition requires that the load be proportionately greater at the large end. Because of this vary- ing load across the face of the tooth, it is desirable to have a fairly short face width. Because of the complexity of bevel, spiral bevel, Zerol bevel, hypoid, and spiroid gears, as well as the limitations of space, only a portion of the applicable standards that refer to straight-bevel gears is presented here.1Table 15–1 gives the symbols used in ANSI/AGMA 2003-B97.

allowance for any externally applied loads in excess of the nominal transmitted load.

Safety Factors SHand SF The factors of safety SHand SFas deﬁned in 2003-B97 are adjustments to strength, not load, and consequently cannot be used as is to assess (by comparison) whether the threat is from wear fatigue or bending fatigue. Since Wtis the same for the pinion and gear, the comparison of √SHto SFallows direct comparison. Dynamic Factor Kv In 2003-C87 AGMA changed the deﬁnition of Kvto its reciprocal but used the same symbol. Other standards have yet to follow this move.

The standard does not mention speciﬁc steel but mentions the hardness attainable by heat treatments such as through-hardening, carburizing and case-hardening, ﬂame- hardening, and nitriding. Through-hardening results depend on size (diametral pitch). Through-hardened materials and the corresponding Rockwell C-scale hardness at the 90 percent martensite shown in parentheses following include 1045 (50), 1060 (54), 1335 (46), 2340 (49), 3140 (49), 4047 (52), 4130 (44), 4140 (49), 4340 (49), 5145 (51), E52100 (60), 6150 (53), 8640 (50), and 9840 (49). For carburized case-hard materials the approximate core hardnesses are 1015 (22), 1025 (37), 1118 (33), 1320 (35), 2317 (30), 4320 (35), 4620 (35), 4820 (35), 6120 (35), 8620 (35), and E9310 (30).

For through- hardened gears, 2003-B97 is silent on KLand CL, and Figs. 15–8 and 15–9 should prudently be considered as approximate. 15–4 Straight-Bevel Gear Analysis EXAMPLE 15–1 A pair of identical straight-tooth miter gears listed in a catalog has a diametral pitch of 5 at the large end, 25 teeth, a 1.10-in face width, and a 20◦normal pressure angle; the gears are grade 1 steel through-hardened with a core and case hardness of 180 Brinell. The gears are uncrowned and intended for general industrial use. They have a quality number of Qv=7. It is likely that the application intended will require outboard mounting of the gears. Use a safety factor of 1, a 107cycle life, and a 0.99 reliability. (a) For a speed of 600 rev/min ﬁnd the power rating of this gearset based on AGMA bending strength. (b) For the same conditions as in part ( a) ﬁnd the power rating of this gearset based on AGMA wear strength. (c) For a reliability of 0.995, a gear life of 109revolutions, and a safety factor of SF=SH=1.5, ﬁnd the power rating for this gearset using AGMA strengths.

The Jfactor for the gear can be smaller than for the pinion. Bending strength is not linear with face width, because added material is placed at the small end of the teeth. Consequently, face width is roughly prescribed as F=min(0.3A0,10/Pd) (15–24) where A0is the cone distance (see Fig. 13–20), given by A0=dP 2 sinγ=dG 2 sin/Gamma1(15–25) EXAMPLE 15–2 Design a straight-bevel gear mesh for shaft centerlines that intersect perpendicularly, to deliver 6.85 hp at 900 rev/min with a gear ratio of 3:1, temperature of 300◦F, normal pressure angle of 20◦, using a design factor of 2. The load is uniform-uniform. Although the minimum number of teeth on the pinion is 13, which will mesh with 31 or more teeth without interference, use a pinion of 20 teeth. The material is to be AGMA grade 1 and the teeth are to be crowned. The reliability goal is 0.995 with a pinion life of 109 revolutions.

We also note that three of the ratios are comparable. Our goal would be to make changes in the design decisions that drive the factors closer to 2. The next step would be to adjust the design variables. It is obvious that an iterative process is involved. We need a ﬁgure of merit to order the designs. A computer program clearly is desirable.bud29281_ch15_785-824.qxd 12/18/09 5:49 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Bevel and Worm Gears 809 /H9278n 14.5° 20° 25° Quantity Symbol NW/H113492 NW/H113492 NW/H110222 Addendum a 0.3183 px 0.3183 px 0.286 px Dedendum b 0.3683 px 0.3683 px 0.349 px Whole depth ht 0.6866 px 0.6866 px 0.635 px *The table entries are for a tangential diametral pitch of the gear of Pt=1.Table 15–8 Cylindrical Worm Dimensions Common to Both Worm and Gear*15–6 Worm Gearing—AGMA Equation Since they are essentially nonenveloping worm gears, the crossed helical gears, shown in Fig. 15–16, can be considered with other worm gearing. Because the teeth of worm gears have point contact changing to line contact as the gears are used, worm gears are said to “wear in,” whereas other types “wear out.” Crossed helical gears, and worm gears too, usually have a 90◦shaft angle, though this need not be so. The relation between the shaft and helix angles is /summationdisplay =ψP±ψG (15–26) where/summationtextis the shaft angle. The plus sign is used when both helix angles are of the same hand, and the minus sign when they are of opposite hand. The subscript Pin Eq. (15–26) refers to the pinion (worm); the subscript Wis used for this same purpose. The subscript Grefers to the gear, also called gear wheel, worm wheel, or simply the wheel . Table 15–8 gives cylindrical worm dimensions common to worm and gear. Section 13–11 introduced worm gears, and Sec. 13–17 developed the force analy- sis and efﬁciency of worm gearing to which we will refer. Here our interest is in strength and durability.

Cooling, for the beneﬁt of the lubricant, becomes a design constraint some- times resulting in what appears to be an oversize gear case in light of its contents. If the heat can be dissipated by natural cooling, or simply with a fan on the wormshaft, simplicity persists. Water coils within the gear case or lubricant outpumping to an exter- nal cooler is the next level of complexity. For this reason, gear-case area is a design decision. To reduce cooling load, use multiple-thread worms. Also keep the worm pitch dia- meter as small as possible. Multiple-thread worms can remove the self-locking feature of many worm-gear drives. When the worm drives the gearset, the mechanical efﬁciency eWis given by eW=cosφn−ftanλ cosφn+fcotλ(15–54) With the gear driving the gearset, the mechanical efﬁciency eGis given by eG=cosφn−fcotλ cosφn+ftanλ(15–55) To ensure that the worm gear will drive the worm, fstat<cosφntanλ (15–56) where values of fstatcan be found in ANSI/AGMA 6034-B92. To prevent the worm gear from driving the worm, refer to clause 9 of 6034-B92 for a discussion of self- locking in the static condition. It is important to have a way to relate the tangential component of the gear force Wt Gto the tangential component of the worm force Wt W, which includes the role of friction and the angularities of φnand λ. Refer to Eq. (13–45) solved for Wt W: Wt W=Wt Gcosφnsinλ+fcosλ cosφncosλ−fsinλ(15–57) In the absence of friction Wt W=Wt Gtanλ The mechanical efﬁciency of most gearing is very high, which allows power in and power out to be used almost interchangeably. Worm gearsets have such poor efﬁcien- cies that we work with, and speak of, output power. The magnitude of the gear trans- mitted force Wt Gcan be related to the output horsepower H0, the application factor Ka, the efﬁciency e, and design factor ndby Wt G=33 000 ndH0Ka VGe(15–58) We use Eq.

The use of Eq. (15–28) together with the factors Cs, Cm, and Cv, with an alloy steel case-hardened worm together with customary nonferrous worm-wheel materials, will result in lives in excess of 25 000 h. The worm-gear materials in the experience base are principally bronzes: •Tin- and nickel-bronzes (chilled-casting produces hardest surfaces) •Lead-bronze (high-speed applications) •Aluminum- and silicon-bronze (heavy load, slow-speed application) The factor Csfor bronze in the spectrum sand-cast, chilled-cast, and centrifugally cast increases in the same order. Standardization of tooth systems is not as far along as it is in other types of gear- ing. For the designer this represents freedom of action, but acquisition of tooling for tooth-forming is more of a problem for in-house manufacturing. When using a subcon- tractor the designer must be aware of what the supplier is capable of providing with on- hand tooling. Axial pitches for the worm are usually integers, and quotients of integers are common. Typical pitches are1 4,5 16,3 8,1 2,3 4,1 ,5 4,6 4,7 4, and 2, but others are possible. Table 15–8 shows dimensions common to both worm gear and cylindrical worm for proportions often used. Teeth frequently are stubbed when lead angles are 30◦or larger. Worm-gear design is constrained by available tooling, space restrictions, shaft center- to-center distances, gear ratios needed, and the designer’s experience. ANSI/AGMA 6022-C93, Design Manual for Cylindrical Wormgearing offers the following guidance. Normal pressure angles are chosen from 14.5◦, 17.5◦,2 0◦, 22.5◦,2 5◦, 27.5◦, and 30◦. The recommended minimum number of gear teeth is given in Table 15–10. The normal range of the number of threads on the worm is 1 through 10. Mean worm pitch diameter is usually chosen in the range given by Eq. (15–27). A design decision is the axial pitch of the worm. Since acceptable proportions are couched in terms of the center-to-center distance, which is not yet known, one chooses a trial axial pitch px.

PROBLEMS 15–1 An uncrowned straight-bevel pinion has 20 teeth, a diametral pitch of 6 teeth/in, and a transmis- sion accuracy number of 6. Both the pinion and gear are made of through-hardened steel with a Brinell hardness of 300. The driven gear has 60 teeth.

The driven gear has 60 teeth. Both are made of No. 30 cast iron. The shaft angle is 90◦. The face width is 1.25 in, the pinion speed is 900 rev/min, and the normal pressure angle is 20◦. The pinion is mounted outboard of its bearings; the bearings of the gear straddle it. What is the power rating based on AGMA bending strength? (For cast iron gearsets reliability information has not yet been developed. We say the life is greater than 107revolutions; set KL=1,CL=1, CR=1,KR=1; and apply a factor of safety.

For the solutions to Probs. 15–3 and 15–4, what is the power rating of the gearset? 15–5 An uncrowned straight-bevel pinion has 22 teeth, a module of 4 mm, and a transmission accuracy number of 5. The pinion and the gear are made of through-hardened steel, both having core and case hardnesses of 180 Brinell. The pinion drives the 24-tooth bevel gear. The shaft angle is 90◦, the pinion speed is 1800 rev/min, the face width is 25 mm, and the normal pressure angle is 20◦. Both gears have an outboard mounting. Find the power rating based on AGMA pitting resistance if the life goal is 109revolutions of the pinion at 0.999 reliability. 15–6 For the gearset and conditions of Prob. 15–5, ﬁnd the power rating for AGMA bending strength. 15–7 In straight-bevel gearing, there are some analogs to Eqs.

This gear pair has a 20◦normal pressure angle, a face width of 0.71 in, and a diametral pitch of 10 teeth/in and is through-hardened to 300 BHN. Assume the gears are for general industrial use, are generated to a transmission accuracy number of 5, and are uncrowned. Given these data, what do you think about the stated catalog power rating? 15–11 Apply the relations of Prob. 15–7 to Ex. 15–1 and ﬁnd the Brinell case hardness of the gears for equal allowable load Wtin bending and wear. Check your work by reworking Ex. 15–1 to see if you are correct. How would you go about the heat treatment of the gears? 15–12 Your experience with Ex. 15–1 and problems based on it will enable you to write an interactive computer program for power rating of through-hardened steel gears. Test your understanding of bevel-gear analysis by noting the ease with which the coding develops. The hardness protocol developed in Prob. 15–7 can be incorporated at the end of your code, ﬁrst to display it, then as an option to loop back and see the consequences of it. 15–13 Use your experience with Prob. 15–11 and Ex. 15–2 to design an interactive computer-aided design program for straight-steel bevel gears, implementing the ANSI/AGMA 2003-B97 standard. It will be helpful to follow the decision set in Sec. 15–5, allowing the return to earlier decisions for revision as the consequences of earlier decisions develop. 15–14 A single-threaded steel worm rotates at 1725 rev/min, meshing with a 56-tooth worm gear trans- mitting 1 hp to the output shaft. The pitch diameter of the worm is 1.50. The tangential diametral pitch of the gear is 8 teeth per inch and the normal pressure angle is 20◦. The ambient temperature is 70◦F, the application factor is 1.25, the design factor is 1, the gear face is 0.5 in, the lateral case area is 850 in2, and the gear is sand-cast bronze. (a) Determine and evaluate the geometric properties of the gears. (b) Determine the transmitted gear forces and the mesh efﬁciency. (c) Is the mesh sufﬁcient to handle the loading? (d) Estimate the lubricant sump temperature. As in Ex. 15–4, design a cylindrical worm-gear mesh to connect a squirrel-cage induction motor to a liquid agitator. The motor speed is 1125 rev/min, and the velocity ratio is to be 10:1. The output power requirement is 25 hp. The shaft axes are 90◦to each other. An overload factor Ko(see Table 15–2) makes allowance for external dynamic excursions of load from the nominal or average load Wt.F o r this service Ko=1.25is appropriate. Additionally, a design factor ndof 1.1 is to be included to address other unquantiﬁable risks.

Because of this similarity of function, clutches, brakes, couplings, and ﬂywheels are treated together in this book. A simpliﬁed dynamic representation of a friction clutch or brake is shown in Fig. 16–1 a. Two inertias, I1and I2,traveling at the respective angular velocities ω1and ω2,one of which may be zero in the case of brakes, are to be brought to the same speed by engaging the clutch or brake. Slippage occurs because the two elements are running at different speeds and energy is dissipated during actuation, resulting in a temperature rise. In analyzing the performance of these devices we shall be interested in: 1The actuating force 2The torque transmitted 3The energy loss 4The temperature rise The torque transmitted is related to the actuating force, the coefﬁcient of friction, and the geometry of the clutch or brake. This is a problem in statics, which will have to be studied separately for each geometric conﬁguration. However, temperature rise is related to energy loss and can be studied without regard to the type of brake or clutch, because the geometry of interest is that of the heat-dissipating surfaces. The various types of devices to be studied may be classiﬁed as follows: 1Rim types with internal expanding shoes 2Rim types with external contracting shoes 3Band types 4Disk or axial types 5Cone types 6Miscellaneous types A ﬂywheel is an inertial energy-storage device. It absorbs mechanical energy by increasing its angular velocity and delivers energy by decreasing its velocity. Figure 16–1 b is a mathematical representation of a ﬂywheel.An input torque Ti,corresponding to a coor- dinate θi,will cause the ﬂywheel speed to increase. And a load or output torque To,with coordinate θo,will absorb energy from the ﬂywheel and cause it to slow down. We shall be interested in designing ﬂywheels so as to obtain a speciﬁed amount of speed regulation. /H92751 I1I2/H92752Clutch or brake Ti, /H9258i To, /H9258o I, /H9258 (b)(a)Figure 16–1 (a) Dynamic representation of a clutch or brake; (b) mathematical representation of a ﬂywheel.bud29281_ch16_825-878.qxd 12/18/09 8:19 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Clutches, Brakes, Couplings, and Flywheels 827 16–1 Static Analysis of Clutches and Brakes Many types of clutches and brakes can be analyzed by following a general procedure. The procedure entails the following tasks: •Estimate, model, or measure the pressure distribution on the friction surfaces. •Find a relationship between the largest pressure and the pressure at any point. •Use the conditions of static equilibrium to ﬁnd the braking force or torque and the support reactions. Let us apply these tasks to the doorstop depicted in Fig. 16–2 a. The stop is hinged at pinA. A normal pressure distribution p(u) is shown under the friction pad as a function of position u, taken from the right edge of the pad.

If the doorstop rotates /Delta1φ counterclockwise, the right and left edges of the pad will deform down y1andy2, respec- tively (Fig. 16–2 b). From similar triangles, y1/(r1/Delta1φ)=c/r1and y2/(r2/Delta1φ)= (c+w1)/r2. Thus, y1=c/Delta1φand y2=(c+w1)/Delta1φ . This means that yis directlybud29281_ch16_825-878.qxd 12/18/09 8:19 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Clutches, Brakes, Couplings, and Flywheels 831 proportional to the horizontal distance from the pivot point A; that is, y=C1v, where C1is a constant (see Fig. 16–2 b). Assuming the pressure is directly proportional to deformation, then p(v)=C2v, where C2is a constant. In terms of u, the pressure is p(u)=C2(c+u)=C2(1.6+u). Eq.

The presumption that the pressure was uniform in part a(because the pad was small, or because the arithmetic would be easier?) underestimated the peak pressure. Modeling the pad as a one-dimensional springset is better, but the pad is really a three-dimensional continuum. A theory of elasticity approach or a ﬁnite element modeling may be overkill, given uncertainties inherent in this problem, but it still represents better modeling.

(Courtesy of the Hilliard Corporation.) 16–2 Internal Expanding Rim Clutches and Brakes The internal-shoe rim clutch shown in Fig. 16–3 consists essentially of three elements: the mating frictional surface, the means of transmitting the torque to and from the surfaces, and the actuating mechanism. Depending upon the operating mechanism, such clutches are further classiﬁed as expanding-ring, centrifugal, magnetic, hydraulic, and pneumatic . The expanding-ring clutch is often used in textile machinery, excavators, and machine tools where the clutch may be located within the driving pulley. Expanding- ring clutches beneﬁt from centrifugal effects; transmit high torque, even at low speeds; and require both positive engagement and ample release force. The centrifugal clutch is used mostly for automatic operation. If no spring is used, the torque transmitted is proportional to the square of the speed. This is particularly useful for electric-motor drives where, during starting, the driven machine comes up to speed without shock. Springs can also be used to prevent engagement until a certain motor speed is reached, but some shock may occur. Magnetic clutches are particularly useful for automatic and remote-control systems. Such clutches are also useful in drives subject to complex load cycles (see Sec. 11–7). Hydraulic and pneumatic clutches are also useful in drives having complex load- ing cycles and in automatic machinery, or in robots. Here the ﬂuid ﬂow can be con- trolled remotely using solenoid valves. These clutches are also available as disk, cone, and multiple-plate clutches. In braking systems, the internal-shoe or drum brake is used mostly for automotive applications. To analyze an internal-shoe device, refer to Fig. 16–4, which shows a shoe pivoted at point A, with the actuating force acting at the other end of the shoe. Since the shoe is long, we cannot make the assumption that the distribution of normal forces is uniform. The mechanical arrangement permits no pressure to be applied at the heel, and we will therefore assume the pressure at this point to be zero. It is the usual practice to omit the friction material for a short distance away from the heel (point A). This eliminates interference, and the material would contribute little to the performance anyway, as will be shown. In some designs the hinge pin is made movable to provide additional heel pressure. This gives the effect of a ﬂoating shoe.bud29281_ch16_825-878.qxd 12/18/09 8:19 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Clutches, Brakes, Couplings, and Flywheels 833 Figure 16–4 Internal friction shoe geometry. ray AF x/H92582d/H9258r d/H9258 /H9258Rim rotation (Floating shoes will not be treated in this book, although their design follows the same general principles.) Let us consider the pressure pacting upon an element of area of the frictional material located at an angle θfrom the hinge pin (Fig. 16–4). We designate the maximum pressure palocated at an angle θafrom the hinge pin. To ﬁnd the pressure distribution on the periphery of the internal shoe, consider point Bon the shoe (Fig. 16–5). As in Ex. 16–1, if the shoe deforms by an inﬁnitesimal rotation /Delta1φabout the pivot point A, deformation per- pendicular to ABis h/Delta1φ. From the isosceles triangle AOB , h=2rsin(θ/2), so h/Delta1φ=2r/Delta1φsin(θ/2) The deformation perpendicular to the rim is h/Delta1φcos(θ/2), which is h/Delta1φcos(θ/2)=2r/Delta1φsin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)=r/Delta1φsinθ Thus, the deformation, and consequently the pressure, is proportional to sin θ.

Since limitations on friction materials are expressed in terms of the largest allowable pressure on the lining, the designer wants to think in terms of paand not about the amplitude of the sinusoidal distribution that addresses locations off the shoe. When θ=0, Eq. (16–1) shows that the pressure is zero. The frictional material located at the heel therefore contributes very little to the braking action and might as well be omitted. A good design would concentrate as much frictional material as pos- sible in the neighborhood of the point of maximum pressure. Such a design is shown in Fig. 16–7. In this ﬁgure the frictional material begins at an angle θ1, measured from the hinge pin A, and ends at an angle θ2. Any arrangement such as this will give a good distribution of the frictional material. Proceeding now (Fig. 16–7), the hinge-pin reactions are Rxand Ry. The actuating force Fhas components Fxand Fyand operates at distance cfrom the hinge pin. At any angle θfrom the hinge pin there acts a differential normal force dNwhose magnitude is dN=pbr dθ (b)Figure 16–6 Deﬁning the angle θaat which the maximum pressure pa occurs when ( a) shoe exists in zone θ1≤θ2≤π/2and (b) shoe exists in zone θ1≤π/2≤θ2./H92581 π /H92582 /H92581 π /H92582/H9258a /H9258ap p/H9258 /H9258 (b)(a) Figure 16–7 Forces on the shoe.

Substituting the value of the pressure from Eq. (16–1), the normal force is dN=pabrsinθdθ sinθa(c) The normal force dNhas horizontal and vertical components dNcosθand dNsinθ, as shown in the ﬁgure. The frictional force fd N has horizontal and vertical compo- nents whose magnitudes are fd N sinθand fd N cosθ, respectively. By applying the conditions of static equilibrium, we may ﬁnd the actuating force F, the torque T, and the pin reactions Rxand Ry. We shall ﬁnd the actuating force F, using the condition that the summation of the moments about the hinge pin is zero. The frictional forces have a moment arm about the pin of r−acosθ. The moment Mfof these frictional forces is Mf=/integraldisplay fd N(r−acosθ)=fpabr sinθa/integraldisplayθ2 θ1sinθ(r−acosθ)dθ (16–2) which is obtained by substituting the value of dNfrom Eq. ( c). It is convenient to integrate Eq. (16–2) for each problem, and we shall therefore retain it in this form. The moment arm of the normal force dNabout the pin is asin θ. Designating the moment of the normal forces by MNand summing these about the hinge pin give MN=/integraldisplay dN(asinθ)=pabra sinθa/integraldisplayθ2 θ1sin2θdθ (16–3) The actuating force Fmust balance these moments. Thus F=MN−Mf c(16–4) We see here that a condition for zero actuating force exists. In other words, if we make MN=Mf, self-locking is obtained, and no actuating force is required. This furnishes us with a method for obtaining the dimensions for some self-energizing action. Thus the dimension ain Fig. 16–7 must be such that MN>Mf (16–5) The torque Tapplied to the drum by the brake shoe is the sum of the frictional forces fd N times the radius of the drum: T=/integraldisplay frdN =fpabr2 sinθa/integraldisplayθ2 θ1sinθdθ =fpabr2(cosθ1−cosθ2) sinθa(16–6) The hinge-pin reactions are found by taking a summation of the horizontal and vertical forces.

Thus, for counterclockwise rotation the actuating force is F=MN+Mf c(16–7) and since both moments have the same sense, the self-energizing effect is lost. Also, for counterclockwise rotation the signs of the frictional terms in the equations for the pin reactions change, and Eqs.

( f) and ( g) become Rx=pabr sinθa(A+fB)−Fx Ry=pabr sinθa(B−fA)−Fy(16–10) In using these equations, the reference system always has its origin at the center of the drum. The positive xaxis is taken through the hinge pin. The positive yaxis is always in the direction of the shoe, even if this should result in a left-handed system. The following assumptions are implied by the preceding analysis: 1The pressure at any point on the shoe is assumed to be proportional to the distance from the hinge pin, being zero at the heel. This should be considered from the standpoint that pressures speciﬁed by manufacturers are averages rather than maxima.bud29281_ch16_825-878.qxd 12/18/09 8:19 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Clutches, Brakes, Couplings, and Flywheels 837 Figure 16–8 Brake with internal expanding shoes; dimensions in millimeters.FF 10062 62 112 50 50150 Rotation 24°126°30°2The effect of centrifugal force has been neglected. In the case of brakes, the shoes are not rotating, and no centrifugal force exists. In clutch design, the effect of this force must be considered in writing the equations of static equilibrium. 3The shoe is assumed to be rigid. Since this cannot be true, some deﬂection will occur, depending upon the load, pressure, and stiffness of the shoe. The resulting pressure distribution may be different from that which has been assumed. 4The entire analysis has been based upon a coefﬁcient of friction that does not vary with pressure. Actually, the coefﬁcient may vary with a number of conditions, including temperature, wear, and environment.

(Courtesy of Twin Disc Clutch Company.) This example dramatically shows the beneﬁt to be gained by arranging the shoes to be self-energizing. If the left-hand shoe were turned over so as to place the hinge pin at the top, it could apply the same torque as the right-hand shoe. This would make the capacity of the brake (2)(366)=732N ·m instead of the present 528 N ·m, a 30 per- cent improvement. In addition, some of the friction material at the heel could be elim- inated without seriously affecting the capacity, because of the low pressure in this area. This change might actually improve the overall design because the additional rim expo- sure would improve the heat-dissipation capacity. 16–3 External Contracting Rim Clutches and Brakes The patented clutch-brake of Fig. 16–10 has external contracting friction elements, but the actuating mechanism is pneumatic. Here we shall study only pivoted external shoe brakes and clutches, though the methods presented can easily be adapted to the clutch- brake of Fig. 16–10. Operating mechanisms can be classiﬁed as: 1Solenoids 2Levers, linkages, or toggle devices 3Linkages with spring loading 4Hydraulic and pneumatic devices The static analysis required for these devices has already been covered in Sec. 3–1. The methods there apply to any mechanism system, including all those used in brakes and clutches. It is not necessary to repeat the material in Chap. 3 that applies directly to such mechanisms. Omitting the operating mechanisms from consideration allows us to con- centrate on brake and clutch performance without the extraneous inﬂuences introduced by the need to analyze the statics of the control mechanisms. The notation for external contracting shoes is shown in Fig. 16–11.

Thus Eq. (16–11) for the actuating force becomes F=MN−Mf c(16–13) and self-energization exists for counterclockwise rotation. The horizontal and vertical reactions are found, in the same manner as before, to be Rx=pabr sinθa(A−fB)−Fx Ry=pabr sinθa(−fA−B)+Fy(16–14) It should be noted that, when external contracting designs are used as clutches, the effect of centrifugal force is to decrease the normal force. Thus, as the speed increases, a larger value of the actuating force Fis required. A special case arises when the pivot is symmetrically located and also placed so that the moment of the friction forces about the pivot is zero. The geometry of such a brake will be similar to that of Fig. 16–12 a. To get a pressure-distribution relation, we note that lining wear is such as to retain the cylindrical shape, much as a milling machine cutter feeding in the xdirection would do to the shoe held in a vise. See Fig. 16–12 b. This means the abscissa component of wear is w0for all positions θ. If wear in the radial direction is expressed as w(θ) , then w(θ)=w0cosθ Using Eq.

Then, denoting Pas p(θ)above and solving for p(θ)gives p(θ)=w(θ) KVt=w0cosθ KVt Since all elemental surface areas of the friction material see the same rubbing speed for the same duration, w0/(KVt)is a constant and p(θ)=(constant) cos θ=pacosθ (c) where pais the maximum value of p(θ). Proceeding to the force analysis, we observe from Fig. 16–12 athat dN=pbr dθ (d) or dN=pabrcosθdθ (e) The distance ato the pivot is chosen by ﬁnding where the moment of the frictional forces Mfis zero. First, this ensures that reaction Ryis at the correct location to establish symmetrical wear. Second, a cosinusoidal pressure distribution is sustained, preserving our predictive ability. Symmetry means θ1=θ2, so Mf=2/integraldisplayθ2 0(fd N)(acosθ−r)=0 Substituting Eq. ( e) gives 2fpabr/integraldisplayθ2 0(acos2θ−rcosθ)dθ=0 from which a=4rsinθ2 2θ2+sin 2θ2(16–15) The distance adepends on the pressure distribution. Mislocating the pivot makes Mf zero about a different location, so the brake lining adjusts its local contact pressure, through wear, to compensate. The result is unsymmetrical wear, retiring the shoe lin- ing, hence the shoe, sooner. With the pivot located according to Eq. (16–15), the moment about the pin is zero, and the horizontal and vertical reactions are Rx=2/integraldisplayθ2 0dNcosθ=pabr 2(2θ2+sin 2θ2) (16–16) where, because of symmetry,/integraldisplay fd N sinθ=0 Also, Ry=2/integraldisplayθ2 0fd N cosθ=pabr f 2(2θ2+sin 2θ2) (16–17)bud29281_ch16_825-878.qxd 12/18/09 8:19 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:844 Mechanical Engineering Design where /integraldisplay dNsinθ=0 also because of symmetry.

The analysis follows the notation of Fig. 16–13. Because of friction and the rotation of the drum, the actuating force P2is less than the pin reaction P1. Any element of the band, of angular length dθ, will be in equili- brium under the action of the forces shown in the ﬁgure.

One of the earliest of these is the cone clutch, which is simple in construction and quite powerful. However, except for relatively simple installations, it has been largely displaced by the disk clutch employing one or more disks as the operating members. Advantages of the disk clutch include the freedom from centrifugal effects, the large frictional area that can be installed in a small space, the more effective heat-dissipation surfaces, and the favorable pressure distribution. Figure 16–14 shows a Figure 16–14 Cross-sectional view of a single-plate clutch; A, driver; B, driven plate (keyed to driven shaft); C, actuator.

It is especially useful for rapid cycling. (Courtesy of Twin Disc Clutch Company.) Figure 16–16 Disk friction member. Ddrdr F single-plate disk clutch; a multiple-disk clutch-brake is shown in Fig. 16–15. Let us now determine the capacity of such a clutch or brake in terms of the material and geometry. Figure 16–16 shows a friction disk having an outside diameter Dand an inside diam- eter d. We are interested in obtaining the axial force Fnecessary to produce a certain torque Tand pressure p. Two methods of solving the problem, depending upon the con- struction of the clutch, are in general use. If the disks are rigid, then the greatest amount of wear will at ﬁrst occur in the outer areas, since the work of friction is greater in those areas. After a certain amount of wear has taken place, the pressure distribution will change so as to permit the wear to be uniform. This is the basis of the ﬁrst method of solution. Another method of construction employs springs to obtain a uniform pressure over the area. It is this assumption of uniform pressure that is used in the second method of solution. Uniform Wear After initial wear has taken place and the disks have worn down to a point where uniform wear is established, the axial wear can be expressed by Eq. (12–27), p. 663, as w=f1f2KPVtbud29281_ch16_825-878.qxd 12/18/09 8:19 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Clutches, Brakes, Couplings, and Flywheels 847 in which only Pand Vvary from place to place in the rubbing surfaces. By deﬁnition uniform wear is constant from place to place; therefore, PV=(constant) =C1 prω=C2 pr=C3=pmaxri=pari=pad 2(a) We can take an expression from Eq. ( a), which is the condition for having the same amount of work done at radius ras is done at radius d/2. Referring to Fig. 16–16, we have an element of area of radius rand thickness dr. The area of this element is 2πrd r, so that the normal force acting upon this element is dF=2πpr dr . We can ﬁnd the total normal force by letting rvary from d/2toD/2and integrating. Thus, with prconstant, F=/integraldisplayD/2 d/22πpr dr=πpad/integraldisplayD/2 d/2dr=πpad 2(D−d) (16–23) The torque is found by integrating the product of the frictional force and the radius: T=/integraldisplayD/2 d/22πfp r2dr=πfpad/integraldisplayD/2 d/2rd r=πfpad 8(D2−d2) (16–24) By substituting the value of Ffrom Eq. (16–23) we may obtain a more convenient expression for the torque. Thus T=Ff 4(D+d) (16–25) In use, Eq. (16–23) gives the actuating force for the selected maximum pressure pa. This equation holds for any number of friction pairs or surfaces. Equation (16–25), however, gives the torque capacity for only a single friction surface. Uniform Pressure When uniform pressure can be assumed over the area of the disk, the actuating force F is simply the product of the pressure and the area. This gives F=πpa 4(D2−d2) (16–26) As before, the torque is found by integrating the product of the frictional force and the radius: T=2πfp/integraldisplayD/2 d/2r2dr=πfp 12(D3−d3) (16–27) Since p=pa, from Eq. (16–26) we can rewrite Eq. (16–27) as T=Ff 3D3−d3 D2−d2(16–28) It should be noted for both equations that the torque is for a single pair of mating surfaces. This value must therefore be multiplied by the number of pairs of surfaces in contact.bud29281_ch16_825-878.qxd 12/18/09 8:19 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:848 Mechanical Engineering Design Let us express Eq. (16–25) for torque during uniform wear as T fF D=1+d/D 4(b) and Eq. (16–28) for torque during uniform pressure (new clutch) as T fF D=1 31−(d/D)3 1−(d/D)2(c) and plot these in Fig. 16–17. What we see is a dimensionless presentation of Eqs. ( b) and ( c) which reduces the number of variables from ﬁve ( T,f,F,D, and d) to three (T/FD,f, and d/D) which are dimensionless. This is the method of Buckingham. The dimensionless groups (called pi terms) are π1=T FDπ2=fπ3=d D This allows a ﬁve-dimensional space to be reduced to a three-dimensional space. Further, because of the “multiplicative” relation between fand Tin Eqs. ( b) and ( c), it is possible to plot π1/π2versus π3in a two-dimensional space (the plane of a sheet of paper) to view all cases over the domain of existence of Eqs. ( b) and ( c) and to compare, without risk of oversight! By examining Fig. 16–17 we can conclude that a new clutch, Eq. ( b), always transmits more torque than an old clutch, Eq. ( c). Furthermore, since clutches of this type are proportioned to make the diameter ratio d/Dfall in the range 0.6≤d/D≤1, the largest discrepancy between Eq. ( b) and Eq. ( c) will be T fF D=1+0.6 4=0.400 (old clutch, uniform wear) T fF D=1 31−0.63 1−0.62=0.4083 (new clutch, uniform pressure) so the proportional error is (0.4083−0.400)/0.400=0.021, or about 2 percent. Given the uncertainties in the actual coefﬁcient of friction and the certainty that new clutches get old, there is little reason to use anything but Eqs. (16–23), (16–24), and (16–25).Figure 16–17 Dimensionless plot of Eqs.

The analysis of the preceding section applies to disk brakes too. We have seen that rim or drum brakes can be designed for self-energization. While this feature is important in reducing the braking effort required, it also has a disadvan- tage. When drum brakes are used as vehicle brakes, only a slight change in the coefﬁcient of friction will cause a large change in the pedal force required for braking. A not unusual 30 percent reduction in the coefﬁcient of friction due to a temperature change or moisture, for example, can result in a 50 percent change in the pedal force required to obtain the same braking torque obtainable prior to the change. The disk brake has no self- energization, and hence is not so susceptible to changes in the coefﬁcient of friction. Another type of disk brake is the ﬂoating caliper brake, shown in Fig. 16–18. The caliper supports a single ﬂoating piston actuated by hydraulic pressure. The action is much like that of a screw clamp, with the piston replacing the function of the screw. The ﬂoating action also compensates for wear and ensures a fairly constant pressure over the area of the friction pads. The seal and boot of Fig. 16–18 are designed to obtain clearance by backing off from the piston when the piston is released. Caliper brakes (named for the nature of the actuating linkage) and disk brakes (named for the shape of the unlined surface) press friction material against the face(s)bud29281_ch16_825-878.qxd 12/18/09 8:19 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:850 Mechanical Engineering Design of a rotating disk.

And the wedging effect lessens rapidly when larger cone angles are used. Depending upon the characteristics of the friction materials, a good com- promise can usually be found using cone angles between 10 and 15◦. To ﬁnd a relation between the operating force Fand the torque transmitted, desig- nate the dimensions of the friction cone as shown in Figure 16–22. As in the case of the axial clutch, we can obtain one set of relations for a uniform-wear and another set for a uniform-pressure assumption. Uniform Wear The pressure relation is the same as for the axial clutch: p=pad 2r(a) Next, referring to Fig. 16–22, we see that we have an element of area dAof radius r and width dr/sinα. Thus dA=(2πrdr)/sinα. As shown in Fig. 16–22, the operatingbud29281_ch16_825-878.qxd 12/18/09 8:19 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Clutches, Brakes, Couplings, and Flywheels 855 force will be the integral of the axial component of the differential force pdA .

This energy appears in the brake in the form of heat. In the same way, when the members of a machine that are ini- tially at rest are brought up to speed, slipping must occur in the clutch until the driven members have the same speed as the driver. Kinetic energy is absorbed during slippage of either a clutch or a brake, and this energy appears as heat. We have seen how the torque capacity of a clutch or brake depends upon the co- efﬁcient of friction of the material and upon a safe normal pressure. However, the char- acter of the load may be such that, if this torque value is permitted, the clutch or brake may be destroyed by its own generated heat. The capacity of a clutch is therefore limited by two factors, the characteristics of the material and the ability of the clutch to dissipate heat. In this section we shall consider the amount of heat generated by a clutching or braking operation. If the heat is generated faster than it is dissipated, we have a temperature-rise problem; that is the subject of the next section. To get a clear picture of what happens during a simple clutching or braking opera- tion, refer to Fig. 16–1 a, which is a mathematical model of a two-inertia system con- nected by a clutch. As shown, inertias I1and I2have initial angular velocities of ω1and ω2, respectively. During the clutch operation both angular velocities change and even- tually become equal. We assume that the two shafts are rigid and that the clutch torque is constant. Writing the equation of motion for inertia 1 gives I1¨θ1=−T (a) where ¨θ1is the angular acceleration of I1and Tis the clutch torque. A similar equation for I2is I2¨θ2=T (b) We can determine the instantaneous angular velocities ˙θ1and ˙θ2of I1and I2after any period of time thas elapsed by integrating Eqs. ( a) and ( b). The results are ˙θ1=−T I1t+ω1 (c) ˙θ2=T I2t+ω2 (d) where ˙θ1=ω1and ˙θ2=ω2at t=0. The difference in the velocities, sometimes called the relative velocity, is ˙θ=˙θ1−˙θ2=−T I1t+ω1−/parenleftbiggT I2t+ω2/parenrightbigg =ω1−ω2−T/parenleftbiggI1+I2 I1I2/parenrightbigg t(16–50) The clutching operation is completed at the instant in which the two angular velocities ˙θ1and ˙θ2become equal. Let the time required for the entire operation be t1. Then ˙θ=0 when ˙θ1=˙θ2, and so Eq. (16–50) gives the time as t1=I1I2(ω1−ω2) T(I1+I2)(16–51)bud29281_ch16_825-878.qxd 12/18/09 8:19 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Clutches, Brakes, Couplings, and Flywheels 857 This equation shows that the time required for the engagement operation is directly proportional to the velocity difference and inversely proportional to the torque. We have assumed the clutch torque to be constant. Therefore, using Eq. (16–50), we ﬁnd the rate of energy-dissipation during the clutching operation to be u=T˙θ=T/bracketleftbigg ω1−ω2−T/parenleftbiggI1+I2 I1I2/parenrightbigg t/bracketrightbigg (e) This equation shows that the energy-dissipation rate is greatest at the start, when t=0. The total energy dissipated during the clutching operation or braking cycle is obtained by integrating Eq. ( e) from t=0to t=t1. The result is found to be E=/integraldisplayt1 0ud t=T/integraldisplayt1 0/bracketleftbigg ω1−ω2−T/parenleftbiggI1+I2 I1I2/parenrightbigg t/bracketrightbigg dt =I1I2(ω1−ω2)2 2(I1+I2)(16–52) where Eq. (16–51) was employed. Note that the energy dissipated is proportional to the velocity difference squared and is independent of the clutch torque. Note that Ein Eq. (16–52) is the energy lost or dissipated; this is the energy that is absorbed by the clutch or brake. If the inertias are expressed in U.S. customary units (lbf·in ·s2), then the energy absorbed by the clutch assembly is in in ·lbf. Using these units, the heat generated in Btu is H=E 9336(16–53) In SI, the inertias are expressed in kilogram-meter2units, and the energy dissipated is expressed in joules. 16–9 Temperature Rise The temperature rise of the clutch or brake assembly can be approximated by the classic expression /Delta1T=H CpW(16–54) where /Delta1T=temperature rise, °F Cp=speciﬁc heat capacity, Btu/(lb m·◦F); use 0.12 for steel or cast iron W=mass of clutch or brake parts, lbm A similar equation can be written for SI units.

However, there are so many variables involved that it wouldbud29281_ch16_825-878.qxd 12/18/09 8:19 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:858 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 16–23 The effect of clutching or braking operations on temperature.

For this reason such analyses are most useful, for repetitive cycling, in pinpointing those design parameters that have the greatest effect on performance. If an object is at initial temperature T1in an environment of temperature T∞, then Newton’s cooling model is expressed as T−T∞ T1−T∞=exp/parenleftbigg −¯hCRA WC pt/parenrightbigg (16–56) where T=temperature at time t, °F T1=initial temperature, °F T∞=environmental temperature, °F ¯hCR=overall coefﬁcient of heat transfer, Btu/(in2·s ·◦F) A=lateral surface area, in2 W=mass of the object, lbm Cp=speciﬁc heat capacity of the object, Btu/(lbm ·◦F) Figure 16–23 shows an application of Eq. (16–56). The curve ABC is the expo- nential decline of temperature given by Eq. (16–56). At time tBa second application of the brake occurs. The temperature quickly rises to temperature T2, and a new cool- ing curve is started. For repetitive brake applications, subsequent temperature peaks T3,T4,..., occur until the brake is able to dissipate by cooling between operations an amount of heat equal to the energy absorbed in the application. If this is a production situation with brake applications every t1seconds, then a steady state develops in which all the peaks Tmaxand all the valleys Tminare repetitive. The heat-dissipation capacity of disk brakes has to be planned to avoid reaching the temperatures of disk and pad that are detrimental to the parts. When a disk brake has a rhythm such as discussed above, then the rate of heat transfer is described by another Newtonian equation: Hloss=¯hCRA(T−T∞)=(hr+fvhc)A(T−T∞) (16–57)bud29281_ch16_825-878.qxd 12/18/09 8:19 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Clutches, Brakes, Couplings, and Flywheels 859 Figure 16–24 (a) Heat-transfer coefﬁcient in still air.

The ventilation of the brake provides a mean air speed of 25 ft/s. The equivalent rotary inertia of the machine as seen from the brake shaft is 289 lbm ·in·s.

Selection involves a consideration of the many characteristics as well as the standard sizes available. The woven-cotton lining is produced as a fabric belt that is impregnated with resins and polymerized. It is used mostly in heavy machinery and is usually supplied in rolls up to 50 ft in length. Thicknesses available range from 1 8to 1 in, in widths up to about 12 in. A woven-asbestos lining is made in a similar manner to the cotton lining and may also contain metal particles. It is not quite as ﬂexible as the cotton lining and comes in a smaller range of sizes. Along with the cotton lining, the asbestos lining was widely used as a brake material in heavy machinery. Molded-asbestos linings contain asbestos ﬁber and friction modiﬁers; a thermoset polymer is used, with heat, to form a rigid or semirigid molding. The principal use was in drum brakes. Molded-asbestos pads are similar to molded linings but have no ﬂexibility; they were used for both clutches and brakes. Sintered-metal pads are made of a mixture of copper and/or iron particles with friction modiﬁers, molded under high pressure and then heated to a high temperature to fuse the material. These pads are used in both brakes and clutches for heavy-duty applications. Cermet pads are similar to the sintered-metal pads and have a substantial ceramic content. Table 16–4 lists properties of typical brake linings. The linings may consist of a mixture of ﬁbers to provide strength and ability to withstand high temperatures, various friction particles to obtain a degree of wear resistance as well as a higher coefﬁcient of friction, and bonding materials. Table 16–5 includes a wider variety of clutch friction materials, together with some of their properties. Some of these materials may be run wet by allowing them to dip in oil or to be sprayed by oil. This reduces the coefﬁcient of friction somewhat but carries away more heat and permits higher pressures to be used.bud29281_ch16_825-878.qxd 12/18/09 8:19 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:864 Mechanical Engineering Design Friction Coefﬁcient Max.

These clutches have the following characteristics: 1They do not slip. 2No heat is generated. 3They cannot be engaged at high speeds. 4Sometimes they cannot be engaged when both shafts are at rest. 5Engagement at any speed is accompanied by shock. The greatest differences among the various types of positive clutches are concerned with the design of the jaws. To provide a longer period of time for shift action during engagement, the jaws may be ratchet-shaped, spiral-shaped, or gear-tooth-shaped. Sometimes a great many teeth or jaws are used, and they may be cut either circumferen- tially, so that they engage by cylindrical mating, or on the faces of the mating elements. Although positive clutches are not used to the extent of the frictional-contact types, they do have important applications where synchronous operation is required, as, for example, in power presses or rolling-mill screw-downs. Devices such as linear drives or motor-operated screwdrivers must run to a deﬁnite limit and then come to a stop. An overload-release type of clutch is required for these applications. Figure 16–25 bis a schematic drawing illustrating the principle of opera- tion of such a clutch. These clutches are usually spring-loaded so as to release at abud29281_ch16_825-878.qxd 12/18/09 8:19 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Clutches, Brakes, Couplings, and Flywheels 865 Figure 16–26 Shaft couplings.

The clicking sound which is heard when the overload point is reached is considered to be a desirable signal. Both fatigue and shock loads must be considered in obtaining the stresses and deﬂections of the various portions of positive clutches. In addition, wear must generally be considered. The application of the fundamentals discussed in Parts 1 and 2 is usually sufﬁcient for the complete design of these devices. An overrunning clutch or coupling permits the driven member of a machine to “freewheel” or “overrun” because the driver is stopped or because another source of power increases the speed of the driven mechanism. The construction uses rollers or balls mounted between an outer sleeve and an inner member having cam ﬂats machined around the periphery. Driving action is obtained by wedging the rollers between the sleeve and the cam ﬂats. This clutch is therefore equivalent to a pawl and ratchet with an inﬁnite number of teeth. There are many varieties of overrunning clutches available, and they are built in capacities up to hundreds of horsepower. Since no slippage is involved, the only power loss is that due to bearing friction and windage. The shaft couplings shown in Fig. 16–26 are representative of the selection avail- able in catalogs.Figure 16–25 (a) Square-jaw clutch; (b) overload release clutch using a detent.

Note that both Tiand Tomay depend for their values on the angular displacements θiand θoas well as their angular velocities ωiand ωo. In many cases the torque characteristic depends upon only one of these. Thus, the torque delivered by an induction motor depends upon the speed of the motor. In fact, motor man- ufacturers publish charts detailing the torque-speed characteristics of their various motors. When the input and output torque functions are given, Eq. ( a) can be solved for the motion of the ﬂywheel using well-known techniques for solving linear and nonlinear differential equations. We can dispense with this here by assuming a rigid shaft, giving θi=θ=θoand ωi=ω=ωo. Thus, Eq. ( a) becomes I¨θ=Ti(θ,ω) −To(θ,ω) (b) When the two torque functions are known and the starting values of the displacement θ and velocity ωare given, Eq. ( b) can be solved for θ, ω, and ¨θas functions of time. However, we are not really interested in the instantaneous values of these terms at all. Primarily we want to know the overall performance of the ﬂywheel. What should its moment of inertia be? How do we match the power source to the load? And what are the resulting performance characteristics of the system that we have selected? To gain insight into the problem, a hypothetical situation is diagrammed in Fig. 16–27. An input power source subjects a ﬂywheel to a constant torque Tiwhile the shaft rotates from θ1to θ2. This is a positive torque and is plotted upward. Equation ( b) indicates that a positive acceleration ¨θwill be the result, and so the shaft velocity increases from ω1to ω2. As shown, the shaft now rotates from θ2to θ3with zero torque and hence, from Eq. ( b), with zero acceleration. Therefore ω3=ω2. From θ3to θ4a load, or output torque, of con- stant magnitude is applied, causing the shaft to slow down from ω3to ω4. Note that the out- put torque is plotted in the negative direction in accordance with Eq. ( b). The work input to the ﬂywheel is the area of the rectangle between θ1and θ2, or Ui=Ti(θ2−θ1) (c)bud29281_ch16_825-878.qxd 12/18/09 8:19 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Clutches, Brakes, Couplings, and Flywheels 867 Figure 16–28 Relation between torque and crank angle for a one-cylinder, four-stroke–cycle internal combustion engine. 180 ° 360 ° 540 ° 720 °Crank torque T Crank angle /H9258TmThe work output of the ﬂywheel is the area of the rectangle from θ3to θ4, or Uo=To(θ4−θ3) (d) If Uois greater than Ui, the load uses more energy than has been delivered to the ﬂy- wheel and so ω4will be less than ω1. If Uo=Ui, ω4will be equal to ω1because the gains and losses are equal; we are assuming no friction losses. And ﬁnally, ω4will be greater than ω1if Ui>Uo. We can also write these relations in terms of kinetic energy. At θ=θ1the ﬂywheel has a velocity of ω1rad/s, and so its kinetic energy is E1=1 2Iω2 1 (e) At θ=θ2the velocity is ω2, and so E2=1 2Iω2 2 (f) Thus the change in kinetic energy is E2−E1=1 2I/parenleftbig ω2 2−ω2 1/parenrightbig (16–61) Many of the torque displacement functions encountered in practical engineering situations are so complicated that they must be integrated by numerical methods. Fig- ure 16–28, for example, is a typical plot of the engine torque for one cycle of motion of a single-cylinder internal combustion engine. Since a part of the torque curve is nega- tive, the ﬂywheel must return part of the energy back to the engine. Integrating this curve from θ=0to 4πand dividing the result by 4πyields the mean torque Tmavail- able to drive a load during the cycle. It is convenient to deﬁne a coefﬁcient of speed ﬂuctuation as Cs=ω2−ω1 ω(16–62)bud29281_ch16_825-878.qxd 12/18/09 8:19 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:868 Mechanical Engineering Design θθθθ deg lbf •in deg lbf •in deg lbf •in deg lbf •in 0 0 195 −107 375 −85 555 −107 15 2800 210 −206 390 −125 570 −206 30 2090 225 −260 405 −89 585 −292 45 2430 240 −323 420 8 600 −355 60 2160 255 −310 435 126 615 −371 75 1840 270 −242 450 242 630 −362 90 1590 285 −126 465 310 645 −312 105 1210 300 −8 480 323 660 −272 120 1066 315 89 495 280 675 −274 135 803 330 125 510 206 690 −548 150 532 345 85 525 107 705 −760 165 184 360 0 540 0 720 0 180 0Table 16–6 Plotting Data for Fig. 16–29where ωis the nominal angular velocity, given by ω=ω2+ω1 2(16–63) Equation (16–61) can be factored to give E2−E1=I 2(ω2−ω1)(ω 2+ω1) Since ω2−ω1=Csωand ω2+ω1=2ω, we have E2−E1=CsIω2(16–64) Equation (16–64) can be used to obtain an appropriate ﬂywheel inertia corresponding to the energy change E2−E1.

Punch-press torque demand often takes the form of a severe impulse and the run- ning friction of the drive train. The motor overcomes the minor task of overcoming fric- tion while attending to the major task of restoring the ﬂywheel’s angular speed. The situation can be idealized as shown in Fig. 16–29. Neglecting the running friction, Euler’s equation can be written as T(θ1−0)=1 2I/parenleftbig ω2 1−ω2 2/parenrightbig =E2−E1 where the only signiﬁcant inertia is that of the ﬂywheel. Punch presses can have the motor and ﬂywheel on one shaft, then, through a gear reduction, drive a slider-crank mechanism that carries the punching tool.

Use Cs=0.30. 16–26 When a motor armature inertia, a pinion inertia, and a motor torque reside on a motor shaft, and a gear inertia, a load inertia, and a load torque exist on a second shaft, it is useful to reﬂect all the torques and inertias to one shaft, say, the armature shaft. We need some rules to make such reﬂec- tion easy. Consider the pinion and gear as disks of pitch radius. A torque on a second shaft is reﬂected to the motor shaft as the load torque divided by the negative of the stepdown ratio. An inertia on a second shaft is reﬂected to the motor shaft as its inertia divided by the stepdown ratio squared. The inertia of a disk gear on a second shaft in mesh with a disk pinion on the motor shaft is reﬂected to the pinion shaft as the pinion inertia multiplied by the stepdown ratio squared.

It often happens that these elements can be used as a replacement for gears, shafts, bear- ings, and other relatively rigid power-transmission devices. In many cases their use sim- pliﬁes the design of a machine and substantially reduces the cost. In addition, since these elements are elastic and usually quite long, they play an important part in absorbing shock loads and in damping out and isolating the effects of vibration. This is an important advantage as far as machine life is concerned. Most ﬂexible elements do not have an inﬁnite life. When they are used, it is important to establish an inspection schedule to guard against wear, aging, and loss of elasticity. The elements should be replaced at the ﬁrst sign of deterioration. 17–1 Belts The four principal types of belts are shown, with some of their characteristics, in Table 17–1. Crowned pulleys are used for ﬂat belts, and grooved pulleys, or sheaves, for round and V belts. Timing belts require toothed wheels, or sprockets . In all cases, the pulley axes must be separated by a certain minimum distance, depending upon the belt type and size, to operate properly. Other characteristics of belts are: •They may be used for long center distances. •Except for timing belts, there is some slip and creep, and so the angular-velocity ratio between the driving and driven shafts is neither constant nor exactly equal to the ratio of the pulley diameters. •In some cases an idler or tension pulley can be used to avoid adjustments in center distance that are ordinarily necessitated by age or the installation of new belts. Figure 17–1 illustrates the geometry of open and closed ﬂat-belt drives. For a ﬂat belt with this drive the belt tension is such that the sag or droop is visible in Fig. 17–2 a, when the belt is running. Although the top is preferred for the loose side of the belt, for other belt types either the top or the bottom may be used, because their installed tension is usually greater. Two types of reversing drives are shown in Fig. 17–2. Notice that both sides of the belt contact the pulleys in Figs. 17–2 band 17–2 c, and so these drives cannot be used with V belts or timing belts. ct=0.03 to 0 .20 in 0.75 to 5 mm c b=0.31 to 0 .91 in 8t o1 9m mbud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/28/09 1:10 PM Page 880Flexible Mechanical Elements 881 /H9258d /H9258 /H9258/H9258D dsin–1 2CD – d 2CD + d2CD – d 2CD – d 2CD + d2CD + d2CD – dsin–1 /H9258d = /H9266 – 2 sin–1 /H9258D = /H9266 + 2 sin–1 L =1 2 sin–1sin–14C2 – (D – d)2 D DC Cd 4C2 – (D + d)24C2 – (D – d)2 +( D/H9258D + d/H9258d) /H9258 = /H9266 + 2 sin–1 L =1 24C2 – (D + d)2 +( D + d)/H9258(a) (b)1 2 1 2Figure 17–1 Flat-belt geometry.

The shafts need not be at right angles as in this case. Note the top view of the drive in Fig. 17–3. The pul- leys must be positioned so that the belt leaves each pulley in the midplane of the other pulley face. Other arrangements may require guide pulleys to achieve this condition. Another advantage of ﬂat belts is shown in Fig. 17–4, where clutching action is obtained by shifting the belt from a loose to a tight or driven pulley. Figure 17–5 shows two variable-speed drives. The drive in Fig. 17–5 ais commonly used only for ﬂat belts. The drive of Fig. 17–5 bcan also be used for V belts and round belts by using grooved sheaves. Flat belts are made of urethane and also of rubber-impregnated fabric reinforced with steel wire or nylon cords to take the tension load. One or both surfaces may have a friction surface coating. Flat belts are quiet, they are efﬁcient at high speeds, and they can transmit large amounts of power over long center distances. Usually, ﬂat belting is purchased by the roll and cut and the ends are joined by using special kits furnished by the manufacturer. Two or more ﬂat belts running side by side, instead of a single wide belt, are often used to form a conveying system. A V belt is made of fabric and cord, usually cotton, rayon, or nylon, and impreg- nated with rubber. In contrast with ﬂat belts, V belts are used with similar sheaves and at shorter center distances. V belts are slightly less efﬁcient than ﬂat belts, but a num- ber of them can be used on a single sheave, thus making a multiple drive. V belts are made only in certain lengths and have no joints. Timing belts are made of rubberized fabric and steel wire and have teeth that ﬁt into grooves cut on the periphery of the sprockets. The timing belt does not stretch or slip and consequently transmits power at a constant angular-velocity ratio. The fact that the belt is toothed provides several advantages over ordinary belting. One of these is that no initial tension is necessary, so that ﬁxed-center drives may be used. Another isbud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/21/09 8:46 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Flexible Mechanical Elements 883 the elimination of the restriction on speeds; the teeth make it possible to run at nearly any speed, slow or fast. Disadvantages are the ﬁrst cost of the belt, the necessity of grooving the sprockets, and the attendant dynamic ﬂuctuations caused at the belt-tooth meshing frequency. 17–2 Flat- and Round-Belt Drives Modern ﬂat-belt drives consist of a strong elastic core surrounded by an elastomer; these drives have distinct advantages over gear drives or V-belt drives. A ﬂat-belt drive has an efﬁciency of about 98 percent, which is about the same as for a gear drive. On the other hand, the efﬁciency of a V-belt drive ranges from about 70 to 96 percent.1Flat-belt drives produce very little noise and absorb more torsional vibration from the system than either V-belt or gear drives. When an open-belt drive (Fig. 17–1 a) is used, the contact angles are found to be θd=π−2 sin−1D−d 2C θD=π+2 sin−1D−d 2C(17–1) where D=diameter of large pulley d=diameter of small pulley C=center distance θ=angle of contact The length of the belt is found by summing the two arc lengths with twice the distance between the beginning and end of contact. The result is L=[4C2−(D−d)2]1/2+1 2(DθD+dθd) (17–2) A similar set of equations can be derived for the crossed belt of Fig. 17–2 b. For this belt, the angle of wrap is the same for both pulleys and is θ=π+2 sin−1D+d 2C(17–3) The belt length for crossed belts is found to be L=[4C2−(D+d)2]1/2+1 2(D+d)θ (17–4) Firbank2explains ﬂat-belt-drive theory in the following way. A change in belt ten- sion due to friction forces between the belt and pulley will cause the belt to elongate or contract and move relative to the surface of the pulley. This motion is caused by elastic creep and is associated with sliding friction as opposed to static friction. The action at the driving pulley, through that portion of the angle of contact that is actually transmit- ting power, is such that the belt moves more slowly than the surface speed of the pulley because of the elastic creep. The angle of contact is made up of the effective arc, 1A. W. Wallin, “Efﬁciency of Synchronous Belts and V-Belts,” Proc. Nat. Conf.

For the driving pulley the belt ﬁrst contacts the pulley with a tight-side tension F1and a velocity V1, which is the same as the surface velocity of the pulley. The belt then passes through the idle arc with no change in F1or V1. Then creep or sliding contact begins, and the belt tension changes in accordance with the friction forces. At the end of the effective arc the belt leaves the pulley with a loose-side tension F2and a reduced speed V2. Firbank has used this theory to express the mechanics of ﬂat-belt drives in mathe- matical form and has veriﬁed the results by experiment. His observations include the ﬁnd- ing that substantially more power is transmitted by static friction than sliding friction. He also found that the coefﬁcient of friction for a belt having a nylon core and leather surface was typically 0.7, but that it could be raised to 0.9 by employing special surface ﬁnishes. Our model will assume that the friction force on the belt is proportional to the nor- mal pressure along the arc of contact. We seek ﬁrst a relationship between the tight side tension and slack side tension, similar to that of band brakes but incorporating the con- sequences of movement, that is, centrifugal tension in the belt. In Fig. 17–6 we see a free body of a small segment of the belt. The differential force dSis due to centrifugal force, dNis the normal force between the belt and pulley, and fd N is the shearing traction due to friction at the point of slip. The belt width is band the thickness is t. The belt mass per unit length is m. The centrifugal force dScan be expressed as dS=(mr dθ)rω2=mr2ω2dθ=mV2dθ=Fcdθ (a) where Vis the belt speed.

Assuming θstarts at the loose side, the boundary con- dition that Fat θ=0equals F2gives A=F2−mr2ω2. The solution is F=(F2−mr2ω2)exp(fθ)+mr2ω2(17–5) At the end of the angle of wrap φ, the tight side, F|θ=φ=F1=(F2−mr2ω2)exp(fφ)+mr2ω2(17–6)bud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/22/09 5:09 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Flexible Mechanical Elements 885 Now we can write F1−mr2ω2 F2−mr2ω2=F1−Fc F2−Fc=exp(fφ) (17–7) where, from Eq.

If Fiequals zero, then Tequals zero: no initial tension, no torque transmitted. The torque is in proportion to the initial tension. This means that if there is to be a satisfactory ﬂat-belt drive, the initial tension must be (1) provided, (2) sustained, (3) in the proper amount, and (4) maintained by routine inspection. From Eq.

(17–9), (17–10), and (17–11) reveal how belting works. We plot Eqs. (17–10) and (17–11) as shown in Fig. 17–8 against Fias abscissa. The initial tension needs to be sufﬁcient so that the difference between the F1and F2curve is 2T/d. With no torque transmitted, the least possible belt tension is F1=F2=Fc. The transmitted horsepower is given by H=(F1−F2)V 33 000(j) Manufacturers provide speciﬁcations for their belts that include allowable tension Fa (or stress σall), the tension being expressed in units of force per unit width. Belt life is usually several years. The severity of ﬂexing at the pulley and its effect on life is reﬂected in a pulley correction factor Cp. Speed in excess of 600 ft/min and its effect on life is reﬂected in a velocity correction factor Cv. For polyamide and urethane belts use Cv=1. For leather belts see Fig. 17–9. A service factor Ksis used for excursions of Figure 17–9 Velocity correction factor Cv for leather belts for various thicknesses.

These sources use a variety of charts, nomographs, and tables to enable someone who knows nothing about belting to apply them. Little, if any, computation is needed for such a person to obtain valid results. Since a basic understanding of the process, in many cases, is lacking, there is no way this person can vary the steps in the process to obtain a better design. Incorporating the available belt-drive data into a form that provides a good under- standing of belt mechanics involves certain adjustments in the data. Because of this, the results from the analysis presented here will not correspond exactly with those of the sources from which they were obtained. A moderate variety of belt materials, with some of their properties, are listed in Table 17–2. These are sufﬁcient for solving a large variety of design and analysis prob- lems. The design equation to be used is Eq. ( j). The values given in Table 17–2 for the allowable belt tension are based on a belt speed of 600 ft/min. For higher speeds, use Fig. 17–9 to obtain Cvvalues for leather belts. For polyamide and urethane belts, use Cv=1.0. The service factors Ksfor V-belt drives, given in Table 17–15 in Sec. 17–3, are also recommended here for ﬂat- and round-belt drives. Minimum pulley sizes for the various belts are listed in Tables 17–2 and 17–3. The pulley correction factor accounts for the amount of bending or ﬂexing of the belt and how this affects the life of the belt. For this reason it is dependent on the size and mate- rial of the belt used. See Table 17–4. Use Cp=1.0for urethane belts. Flat-belt pulleys should be crowned to keep belts from running off the pulleys. If only one pulley is crowned, it should be the larger one. Both pulleys must be crowned when- ever the pulley axes are not in a horizontal position. Use Table 17–5 for the crown height.bud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/21/09 8:46 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Minimum Allowable Tension Pulley per Unit Width Speciﬁc Size, Diameter, at 600 ft/min, Weight, Coefﬁcient Material Speciﬁcation in in lbf/in lbf/in3of Friction Leather 1 ply t/H11005 11 643 30 0.035–0.045 0.4 t/H11005 13 6431 233 0.035–0.045 0.4 2 ply t/H11005 18 6441 241 0.035–0.045 0.4 t/H11005 20 646a50 0.035–0.045 0.4 t/H11005 23 649a60 0.035–0.045 0.4 PolyamidebF–0ct/H11005 0.03 0.60 10 0.035 0.5 F–1ct/H11005 0.05 1.0 35 0.035 0.5 F–2ct/H11005 0.07 2.4 60 0.051 0.5 A–2ct/H11005 0.11 2.4 60 0.037 0.8 A–3ct/H11005 0.13 4.3 100 0.042 0.8 A–4ct/H11005 0.20 9.5 175 0.039 0.8 A–5ct/H11005 0.25 13.5 275 0.039 0.8 Urethanedw=0.50 t/H11005 0.062 See 5.2e0.038–0.045 0.7 w=0.75 t/H11005 0.078 Table 9.8e0.038–0.045 0.7 w=1.25 t/H11005 0.090 17–3 18.9e0.038–0.045 0.7 Round d/H11005 1 4See 8.3e0.038–0.045 0.7 d/H11005 3 8Table 18.6e0.038–0.045 0.7 d/H11005 1 217–3 33.0e0.038–0.045 0.7 d/H11005 3 474.3e0.038–0.045 0.7 aAdd 2 in to pulley size for belts 8 in wide or more. bSource: Habasit Engineering Manual, Habasit Belting, Inc., Chamblee (Atlanta), Ga. cFriction cover of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber on both sides. dSource: Eagle Belting Co., Des Plaines, Ill. eAt 6% elongation; 12% is maximum allowable value.Table 17–2 Properties of Some Flat- and Round-Belt Materials.

There are ways of controlling initial tension. One way is to place the motor and drive pulley on a pivoted mounting plate so that the weight of the motor, pulley, and mounting plate and a share of the belt weight induces the correct initial tension and maintains it. A second way is use of a spring-loaded idler pulley, adjusted to the same task. Both of these methods accommodate to temporary or permanent belt stretch. See Fig. 17–11. Because ﬂat belts were used for long center-to-center distances, the weight of the belt itself can provide the initial tension. The static belt deﬂects to an approximate cate- nary curve, and the dip from a straight belt can be measured against a stretched music wire. This provides a way of measuring and adjusting the dip. From catenary theory the dip is related to the initial tension by dip=12(C/12)2w 8Fi=C2w 96Fi(17–13) where dip=dip, in C=center-to-center distance, in w=weight per foot of the belt, lbf/ft Fi=initial tension, lbf In Ex. 17–1 the dip corresponding to a 270.6-lbf initial tension is dip=(962)0.393 96(270.6)=0.14 in W Slack side Tight sideF2 F1 W Fi FiC dip(a) (b) (c)Figure 17–11 Belt-tensioning schemes.

EXAMPLE 17–2 Design a ﬂat-belt drive to connect horizontal shafts on 16-ft centers. The velocity ratio is to be 2.25:1. The angular speed of the small driving pulley is 860 rev/min, and the nominal power transmission is to be 60 hp under very light shock.

Flat Metal Belts Thin ﬂat metal belts with their attendant strength and geometric stability could not be fabricated until laser welding and thin rolling technology made possible belts as thin as 0.002 in and as narrow as 0.026 in. The introduction of perforations allows no-slip applications. Thin metal belts exhibit •High strength-to-weight ratio •Dimensional stability •Accurate timing •Usefulness to temperatures up to 700°F •Good electrical and thermal conduction properties In addition, stainless steel alloys offer “inert,” nonabsorbent belts suitable to hos- tile (corrosive) environments, and can be made sterile for food and pharmaceutical applications. Thin metal belts can be classiﬁed as friction drives, timing or positioning drives, or tape drives. Among friction drives are plain, metal-coated, and perforated belts. Crowned pulleys are used to compensate for tracking errors. Figure 17–13 shows a thin ﬂat metal belt with the tight tension F1and the slack side tension F2revealed. The relationship between F1and F2and the driving torque T is the same as in Eq. ( h). Equations (17–9), (17–10), and (17–11) also apply. The largest allowable tension, as in Eq. (17–12), is posed in terms of stress in metal belts. A bend- ing stress is created by making the belt conform to the pulley, and its tensile magnitude σbis given by σb=Et (1−ν2)D=E (1−ν2)(D/t)(17–14)bud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/22/09 5:10 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:896 Mechanical Engineering Design Belt Passes 625 ≥106 400 0.500 ·106 333 0.165 ·106 200 0.085 ·106 *Data courtesy of Belt Technologies, Agawam, Mass.Table 17–6 Belt Life for Stainless Steel Friction Drives*Figure 17–13 Metal-belt tensions and torques.

During a belt pass both levels of stress appear. Although the belts are of simple geometry, the method of Marin is not used because the condition of the butt weldment (to form the loop) is not accurately known, and the testing of coupons is difﬁcult. The belts are run to failure on two equal-sized pulleys. Information concerning fatigue life, as shown in Table 17–6, is obtainable. Tables 17–7 and 17–8 give additional information. Table 17–6 shows metal belt life expectancies for a stainless steel belt. From Eq.

To specify a V belt, give the belt-section letter, followed by the inside circumfer- ence in inches (standard circumferences are listed in Table 17–10). For example, B75 is a B-section belt having an inside circumference of 75 in. Calculations involving the belt length are usually based on the pitch length. For any given belt section, the pitch length is obtained by adding a quantity to the inside cir- cumference (Tables 17–10 and 17–11). For example, a B75 belt has a pitch length of 76.8 in. Similarly, calculations of the velocity ratios are made using the pitch diameters of the sheaves, and for this reason the stated diameters are usually understood to be the pitch diameters even though they are not always so speciﬁed. The groove angle of a sheave is made somewhat smaller than the belt-section angle. This causes the belt to wedge itself into the groove, thus increasing friction. The exact value of this angle depends on the belt section, the sheave diameter, and the angle of contact. If it is made too much smaller than the belt, the force required to pull the belt out of the groove as the belt leaves the pulley will be excessive. Optimum values are given in the commercial literature.bud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/25/2009 7:30 am pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:900 Mechanical Engineering Design The minimum sheave diameters have been listed in Table 17–9. For best results, a V belt should be run quite fast: 4000 ft/min is a good speed. Trouble may be encoun- tered if the belt runs much faster than 5000 ft/min or much slower than 1000 ft/min.

In the case of ﬂat belts, there is virtually no limit to the center-to-center distance. Long center-to-center distances are not recommended for V belts because the excessive vibration of the slack side will shorten the belt life materially. In general, the center- to-center distance should be no greater than 3 times the sum of the sheave diameters and no less than the diameter of the larger sheave. Link-type V belts have less vibration, because of better balance, and hence may be used with longer center-to- center distances. The basis for power ratings of V belts depends somewhat on the manufacturer; it is not often mentioned quantitatively in vendors’ literature but is available from ven- dors. The basis may be a number of hours, 24 000, for example, or a life of 108or 109 belt passes. Since the number of belts must be an integer, an undersized belt set that is augmented by one belt can be substantially oversized. Table 17–12 gives power ratings of standard V belts. The rating, whether in terms of hours or belt passes, is for a belt running on equal- diameter sheaves (180◦of wrap), of moderate length, and transmitting a steady load. Deviations from these laboratory test conditions are acknowledged by multiplicative adjustments. If the tabulated power of a belt for a C-section belt is 9.46 hp for a 12-in- diameter sheave at a peripheral speed of 3000 ft/min (Table 17–12), then, when the belt is used under other conditions, the tabulated value Htabis adjusted as follows: Ha=K1K2Htab (17–17) where Ha=allowable power, per belt K1=angle-of-wrap correction factor, Table 17–13 K2=belt length correction factor, Table 17–14 The allowable power can be near to Htab, depending upon circumstances. In a V belt the effective coefﬁcient of friction f/primeis f/sin(φ/2), which amounts to an augmentation by a factor of about 3 due to the grooves. The effective coefﬁcient of friction f/primeis sometimes tabulated against sheave groove angles of 30◦, 34◦, and 38◦, the tabulated values being 0.50, 0.45, and 0.40, respectively, revealing a belt material- on-metal coefﬁcient of friction of 0.13 for each case. The Gates Rubber Company declares its effective coefﬁcient of friction to be 0.5123 for grooves. Thus F1−Fc F2−Fc=exp(0.5123φ) (17–18) The design power is given by Hd=HnomKsnd (17–19) where Hnomis the nominal power, Ksis the service factor given in Table 17–15, and ndis the design factor. The number of belts, Nb, is usually the next higher integer to Hd/Ha.bud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/21/09 8:46 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Flexible Mechanical Elements 901 Belt Sheave PitchBelt Speed, ft/min Section Diameter, in 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 A 2.6 0.47 0.62 0.53 0.15 3.0 0.66 1.01 1.12 0.93 0.38 3.4 0.81 1.31 1.57 1.53 1.12 3.8 0.93 1.55 1.92 2.00 1.71 4.2 1.03 1.74 2.20 2.38 2.19 4.6 1.11 1.89 2.44 2.69 2.58 5.0 and up 1.17 2.03 2.64 2.96 2.89 B 4.2 1.07 1.58 1.68 1.26 0.22 4.6 1.27 1.99 2.29 2.08 1.24 5.0 1.44 2.33 2.80 2.76 2.10 5.4 1.59 2.62 3.24 3.34 2.82 5.8 1.72 2.87 3.61 3.85 3.45 6.2 1.82 3.09 3.94 4.28 4.00 6.6 1.92 3.29 4.23 4.67 4.48 7.0 and up 2.01 3.46 4.49 5.01 4.90 C 6.0 1.84 2.66 2.72 1.87 7.0 2.48 3.94 4.64 4.44 3.12 8.0 2.96 4.90 6.09 6.36 5.52 9.0 3.34 5.65 7.21 7.86 7.39 10.0 3.64 6.25 8.11 9.06 8.89 11.0 3.88 6.74 8.84 10.0 10.1 12.0 and up 4.09 7.15 9.46 10.9 11.1 D 10.0 4.14 6.13 6.55 5.09 1.35 11.0 5.00 7.83 9.11 8.50 5.62 12.0 5.71 9.26 11.2 11.4 9.18 13.0 6.31 10.5 13.0 13.8 12.2 14.0 6.82 11.5 14.6 15.8 14.8 15.0 7.27 12.4 15.9 17.6 17.0 16.0 7.66 13.2 17.1 19.2 19.0 17.0 and up 8.01 13.9 18.1 20.6 20.7 E 16.0 8.68 14.0 17.5 18.1 15.3 18.0 9.92 16.7 21.2 23.0 21.5 20.0 10.9 18.7 24.2 26.9 26.4 22.0 11.7 20.3 26.6 30.2 30.5 24.0 12.4 21.6 28.6 32.9 33.8 26.0 13.0 22.8 30.3 35.1 36.7 28.0 and up 13.4 23.7 31.8 37.1 39.1Table 17–12 Horsepower Ratings of Standard V Belts That is, Nb≥Hd HaNb=1,2,3,...

It has teeth that ﬁt into grooves cut on the periphery of the pulleys (Fig. 17–15). A timing belt does not stretch appreciably or slip and conse- quently transmits power at a constant angular-velocity ratio. No initial tension is needed.bud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/21/09 8:46 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Flexible Mechanical Elements 907 Such belts can operate over a very wide range of speeds, have efﬁciencies in the range of 97 to 99 percent, require no lubrication, and are quieter than chain drives. There is no chordal-speed variation, as in chain drives (see Sec. 17–5), and so they are an attrac- tive solution for precision-drive requirements. The steel wire, the tension member of a timing belt, is located at the belt pitch line (Fig. 17–15). Thus the pitch length is the same regardless of the thickness of the backing. The ﬁve standard inch-series pitches available are listed in Table 17–18 with their letter designations. Standard pitch lengths are available in sizes from 6 to 180 in. Pulleys come in sizes from 0.60 in pitch diameter up to 35.8 in and with groove num- bers from 10 to 120. The design and selection process for timing belts is so similar to that for V belts that the process will not be presented here. As in the case of other belt drives, the manufac- turers will provide an ample supply of information and details on sizes and strengths. 17–5 Roller Chain Basic features of chain drives include a constant ratio, since no slippage or creep is involved; long life; and the ability to drive a number of shafts from a single source of power. Roller chains have been standardized as to sizes by the ANSI. Figure 17–16 shows the nomenclature. The pitch is the linear distance between the centers of the rollers. The width is the space between the inner link plates. These chains are manufactured in sin- gle, double, triple, and quadruple strands. The dimensions of standard sizes are listed in Table 17–19.Service Designation Pitch p, in Extra light XL1 5 Light L3 8 Heavy H1 2 Extra heavy XH7 8 Double extra heavy XXH 11 4Table 17–18 Standard Pitches of Timing Belts Roller diameter Width Pitch pStrand spacingFigure 17–16 Portion of a double-strand roller chain.bud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/21/09 8:46 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:908 Mechanical Engineering Design Minimum Average Multiple- ANSI Tensile Weight, Roller Strand Chain Pitch, Width, Strength, lbf/ft Diameter, Spacing, Number in (mm) in (mm) lbf (N) (N/m) in (mm) in (mm) 25 0.250 0.125 780 0.09 0.130 0.252 (6.35) (3.18) (3 470) (1.31) (3.30) (6.40) 35 0.375 0.188 1 760 0.21 0.200 0.399 (9.52) (4.76) (7 830) (3.06) (5.08) (10.13) 41 0.500 0.25 1 500 0.25 0.306 — (12.70) (6.35) (6 670) (3.65) (7.77) — 40 0.500 0.312 3 130 0.42 0.312 0.566 (12.70) (7.94) (13 920) (6.13) (7.92) (14.38) 50 0.625 0.375 4 880 0.69 0.400 0.713 (15.88) (9.52) (21 700) (10.1) (10.16) (18.11) 60 0.750 0.500 7 030 1.00 0.469 0.897 (19.05) (12.7) (31 300) (14.6) (11.91) (22.78) 80 1.000 0.625 12 500 1.71 0.625 1.153 (25.40) (15.88) (55 600) (25.0) (15.87) (29.29) 100 1.250 0.750 19 500 2.58 0.750 1.409 (31.75) (19.05) (86 700) (37.7) (19.05) (35.76) 120 1.500 1.000 28 000 3.87 0.875 1.789 (38.10) (25.40) (124 500) (56.5) (22.22) (45.44) 140 1.750 1.000 38 000 4.95 1.000 1.924 (44.45) (25.40) (169 000) (72.2) (25.40) (48.87) 160 2.000 1.250 50 000 6.61 1.125 2.305 (50.80) (31.75) (222 000) (96.5) (28.57) (58.55) 180 2.250 1.406 63 000 9.06 1.406 2.592 (57.15) (35.71) (280 000) (132.2) (35.71) (65.84) 200 2.500 1.500 78 000 10.96 1.562 2.817 (63.50) (38.10) (347 000) (159.9) (39.67) (71.55) 240 3.00 1.875 112 000 16.4 1.875 3.458 (76.70) (47.63) (498 000) (239) (47.62) (87.83)Table 17–19 Dimensions of American Standard Roller Chains—Single Strand Source: Compiled from ANSI B29.1-1975. Figure 17–17 shows a sprocket driving a chain and rotating in a counterclockwise direction. Denoting the chain pitch by p, the pitch angle by γ, and the pitch diameter of the sprocket by D, from the trigonometry of the ﬁgure we see sinγ 2=p/2 D/2or D=p sin(γ/2)(a) Since γ=360◦/N, where Nis the number of sprocket teeth, Eq. ( a) can be written D=p sin(180◦/N)(17–29) The angle γ/2, through which the link swings as it enters contact, is called the angle of articulation . It can be seen that the magnitude of this angle is a function of the number of teeth. Rotation of the link through this angle causes impact between thebud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/21/09 8:46 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Flexible Mechanical Elements 909 p A Be /H9253 D/H9253⁄2 VariableFigure 17–17 Engagement of a chain and sprocket. rollers and the sprocket teeth and also wear in the chain joint. Since the life of a prop- erly selected drive is a function of the wear and the surface fatigue strength of the rollers, it is important to reduce the angle of articulation as much as possible. The number of sprocket teeth also affects the velocity ratio during the rotation through the pitch angle γ. At the position shown in Fig. 17–17, the chain ABis tangent to the pitch circle of the sprocket. However, when the sprocket has turned an angle of γ/2, the chain line ABmoves closer to the center of rotation of the sprocket. This means that the chain line ABis moving up and down, and that the lever arm varies with rotation through the pitch angle, all resulting in an uneven chain exit velocity. You can think of the sprocket as a polygon in which the exit velocity of the chain depends upon whether the exit is from a corner, or from a ﬂat of the polygon. Of course, the same effect occurs when the chain ﬁrst enters into engagement with the sprocket. The chain velocity Vis deﬁned as the number of feet coming off the sprocket per unit time. Thus the chain velocity in feet per minute is V=Npn 12(17–30) where N=number of sprocket teeth p=chain pitch, in n=sprocket speed, rev/min The maximum exit velocity of the chain is vmax=πDn 12=πnp 12 sin(γ/2)(b) where Eq. ( a) has been substituted for the pitch diameter D. The minimum exit velocity occurs at a diameter d, smaller than D. Using the geometry of Fig. 17–17, we ﬁnd d=Dcosγ 2(c) Thus the minimum exit velocity is vmin=πdn 12=πnp 12cos(γ/2) sin(γ/2)(d)bud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/21/09 8:46 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:910 Mechanical Engineering Design Now substituting γ/2=180◦/Nand employing Eqs. (17–30), ( b), and ( d), we ﬁnd the speed variation to be /Delta1V V=vmax−vmin V=π N/bracketleftbigg1 sin(180◦/N)−1 tan(180◦/N)/bracketrightbigg (17–31) This is called the chordal speed variation and is plotted in Fig. 17–18. When chain drives are used to synchronize precision components or processes, due consideration must be given to these variations. For example, if a chain drive synchronized the cut- ting of photographic ﬁlm with the forward drive of the ﬁlm, the lengths of the cut sheets of ﬁlm might vary too much because of this chordal speed variation. Such variations can also cause vibrations within the system. Although a large number of teeth is considered desirable for the driving sprocket, in the usual case it is advantageous to obtain as small a sprocket as possible, and this requires one with a small number of teeth. For smooth operation at moderate and high speeds it is considered good practice to use a driving sprocket with at least 17 teeth; 19 or 21 will, of course, give a better life expectancy with less chain noise. Where space limitations are severe or for very slow speeds, smaller tooth numbers may be used by sacriﬁcing the life expectancy of the chain. Driven sprockets are not made in standard sizes over 120 teeth, because the pitch elongation will eventually cause the chain to “ride” high long before the chain is worn out. The most successful drives have velocity ratios up to 6:1, but higher ratios may be used at the sacriﬁce of chain life. Roller chains seldom fail because they lack tensile strength; they more often fail because they have been subjected to a great many hours of service. Actual failure may be due either to wear of the rollers on the pins or to fatigue of the surfaces of the rollers. Roller-chain manufacturers have compiled tables that give the horsepower capacity cor- responding to a life expectancy of 15 kh for various sprocket speeds. These capacities are tabulated in Table 17–20 for 17-tooth sprockets. Table 17–21 displays available tooth counts on sprockets of one supplier. Table 17–22 lists the tooth correction factors for other than 17 teeth. Table 17–23 shows the multiple-strand factors K2.

Given the poor operating conditions, life will be much shorter. Lubrication of roller chains is essential in order to obtain a long and trouble-free life. Either a drip feed or a shallow bath in the lubricant is satisfactory. A medium or light mineral oil, without additives, should be used. Except for unusual conditions, heavy oils and greases are not recommended, because they are too viscous to enter the small clearances in the chain parts.bud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/21/09 8:46 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:916 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 17–19 Types of wire rope; both lays are available in either right or left hand. (a) Regular lay (b) Lang lay(c) Section of 6 × 7 rope17–6 Wire Rope Wire rope is made with two types of winding, as shown in Fig. 17–19. The regular lay, which is the accepted standard, has the wire twisted in one direction to form the strands, and the strands twisted in the opposite direction to form the rope. In the completed rope the visible wires are approximately parallel to the axis of the rope. Regular-lay ropes do not kink or untwist and are easy to handle. Lang-lay ropes have the wires in the strand and the strands in the rope twisted in the same direction, and hence the outer wires run diagonally across the axis of the rope. Lang-lay ropes are more resistant to abrasive wear and failure due to fatigue than are regular-lay ropes, but they are more likely to kink and untwist. Standard ropes are made with a hemp core, which supports and lubricates the strands. When the rope is subjected to heat, either a steel center or a wire-strand center must be used. Wire rope is designated as, for example, a 11 8-in 6×7haulage rope. The ﬁrst ﬁgure is the diameter of the rope (Fig. 17–19 c). The second and third ﬁgures are the number of strands and the number of wires in each strand, respectively. Table 17–24 lists some of the various ropes that are available, together with their characteristics and properties. The area of the metal in standard hoisting and haulage rope is Am=0.38d2. When a wire rope passes around a sheave, there is a certain amount of readjustment of the elements. Each of the wires and strands must slide on several others, and pre- sumably some individual bending takes place. It is probable that in this complex action there exists some stress concentration. The stress in one of the wires of a rope passing around a sheave may be calculated as follows. From solid mechanics, we have M=EI ρand M=σI c(a) where the quantities have their usual meaning. Eliminating Mand solving for the stress gives σ=Ec ρ(b) For the radius of curvature ρ, we can substitute the sheave radius D/2. Also, c=dw/2, where dwis the wire diameter. These substitutions give σ=Erdw D(c) where Eris the modulus of elasticity of the rope , not the wire. To understand this equa- tion, observe that the individual wire makes a corkscrew ﬁgure in space and if you pull on it to determine Eit will stretch or give more than its native Ewould suggest.

Eis still the modulus of elasticity of the wire, but in its peculiar conﬁguration as part of the rope, its modulus is smaller. For this reason we say that Erin Eq. ( c) is the modulus of elasticity of the rope, not the wire, recognizing that one can quibble over the name used. Equation ( c) gives the tensile stress σin the outer wires. The sheave diameter is represented by D. This equation reveals the importance of using a large-diameter sheave. The suggested minimum sheave diameters in Table 17–24 are based on a D/dw ratio of 400. If possible, the sheaves should be designed for a larger ratio. For elevators and mine hoists, D/dwis usually taken from 800 to 1000. If the ratio is less than 200, heavy loads will often cause a permanent set in the rope. A wire rope tension giving the same tensile stress as the sheave bending is called the equivalent bending load Fb, given by Fb=σAm=ErdwAm D(17–41) A wire rope may fail because the static load exceeds the ultimate strength of the rope. Failure of this nature is generally not the fault of the designer, but rather that of the operator in permitting the rope to be subjected to loads for which it was not designed.bud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/21/09 8:46 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:918 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 17–20 Percent strength loss due to different D/dratios; derived from standard test data for 6×19 and 6 ×17 class ropes.

This load is composed of the following items: •The known or dead weight •Additional loads caused by sudden stops or starts •Shock loads •Sheave-bearing friction When these loads are summed, the total can be compared with the ultimate strength of the rope to ﬁnd a factor of safety. However, the ultimate strength used in this determi- nation must be reduced by the strength loss that occurs when the rope passes over a curved surface such as a stationary sheave or a pin; see Fig. 17–20. For an average operation, use a factor of safety of 5. Factors of safety up to 8 or 9 are used if there is danger to human life and for very critical situations.

Here, the factor of safety is deﬁned as n=Fu Ft where Fuis the ultimate wire load and Ftis the largest working tension. Once you have made a tentative selection of a rope based upon static strength, the next consideration is to ensure that the wear life of the rope and the sheave or sheaves meets certain requirements. When a loaded rope is bent over a sheave, the rope stretches like a spring, rubs against the sheave, and causes wear of both the rope and the sheave. The amount of wear that occurs depends upon the pressure of the rope in the sheave groove. This pressure is called the bearing pressure; a good estimate of its magnitude is given by p=2F dD(17–42) where F=tensile force on rope d=rope diameter D=sheave diameter The allowable pressures given in Table 17–26 are to be used only as a rough guide; they may not prevent a fatigue failure or severe wear. They are presented here because they represent past practice and furnish a starting point in design. A fatigue diagram not unlike an S-Ndiagram can be obtained for wire rope. Such a diagram is shown in Fig. 17–21. Here the ordinate is the pressure-strength ratio p/Su, and Suis the ultimate tensile strength of the wire. The abscissa is the number of bends that occur in the total life of the rope. The curve implies that a wire rope has a fatigue limit; but this is not true at all. A wire rope that is used over sheaves will eventually failbud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/21/09 8:46 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:920 Mechanical Engineering Design Figure 17–21 Experimentally determined relation between the fatigue life of wire rope and the sheave pressure. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 101234567 6 × 37 6 × 19 6 × 126 × 24 Number of bends to failure, in millionsPressure-strength ratio, 1000 p⁄Su in fatigue or in wear. However, the graph does show that the rope will have a long life if the ratio p/Suis less than 0.001. Substitution of this ratio in Eq. (17–42) gives Su=2000 F dD(17–43) where Suis the ultimate strength of the wire, not the rope, and the units of Suare related to the units of F. This interesting equation contains the wire strength, the load, the rope diameter, and the sheave diameter—all four variables in a single equation! Dividing both sides of Eq. (17–42) by the ultimate strength of the wires Suand solving for Fgives Ff=(p/Su)SudD 2(17–44) where Ffis interpreted as the allowable fatigue tension as the wire is ﬂexed a number of times corresponding to p/Suselected from Fig. 17–21 for a particular rope and life expectancy. The factor of safety can be deﬁned in fatigue as nf=Ff−Fb Ft(17–45) where Ffis the rope tension strength under ﬂexing and Ftis the tension at the place where the rope is ﬂexing. Unfortunately, the designer often has vendor information that tabulates ultimate rope tension and gives no ultimate-strength Suinformation concerning the wires from which the rope is made. Some guidance in strength of individual wires is Improved plow steel (monitor) 240<Su<280 kpsi Plow steel 210<Su<240 kpsi Mild plow steel 180<Su<210 kpsi In wire-rope usage, the factor of safety has been deﬁned in static loading as n= Fu/Ftorn=(Fu−Fb)/Ft, where Fbis the rope tension that would induce the same outer-wire stress as that given by Eq. ( c). The factor of safety in fatigue loading can be deﬁned as in Eq. (17–45), or by using a static analysis and compensating with a large fac- tor of safety applicable to static loading, as in Table 17–25. When using factors of safety expressed in codes, standards, corporate design manuals, or wire-rope manufacturers’bud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/21/09 8:46 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Flexible Mechanical Elements 921 recommendations or from the literature, be sure to ascertain upon which basis the fac- tor of safety is to be evaluated, and proceed accordingly. If the rope is made of plow steel, the wires are probably hard-drawn AISI 1070 or 1080 carbon steel. Referring to Table 10–3, we see that this lies somewhere between hard-drawn spring wire and music wire. But the constants mand Aneeded to solve Eq. (10–14), p. 523, for Suare lacking. Practicing engineers who desire to solve Eq. (17–43) should determine the wire strength Sufor the rope under consideration by unraveling enough wire to test for the Brinell hardness. Then Sucan be found using Eq. (2–17), p. 40. Fatigue failure in wire rope is not sudden, as in solid bodies, but progressive, and shows as the breaking of an outside wire. This means that the beginning of fatigue can be detected by periodic routine inspection. Figure 17–22 is another graph showing the gain in life to be obtained by using large D/dratios. In view of the fact that the life of wire rope used over sheaves is only ﬁnite, it is extremely important that the designer specify and insist that periodic inspection, lubrication, and maintenance procedures be carried out during the life of the rope. Table 17–27 gives useful properties of some wire ropes. For a mine-hoist problem we can develop working equations from the preceding presentation.

Note that for each m the factor of safety exhibits a maximum. Predictably the largest factor of safety increases with m. If the required factor of safety were to be 6, only three or four ropes could meet the requirement. The sizes are different: 5 8-in ropes with three ropes or 3 8-in ropes with four ropes. The costs include not only the wires, but the grooved winch drums. 17–7 Flexible Shafts One of the greatest limitations of the solid shaft is that it cannot transmit motion or power around corners. It is therefore necessary to resort to belts, chains, or gears, together with bearings and the supporting framework associated with them. The ﬂexible shaft may often be an economical solution to the problem of transmitting motion around corners. In addition to the elimination of costly parts, its use may reduce noise considerably. There are two main types of ﬂexible shafts: the power-drive shaft for the transmis- sion of power in a single direction, and the remote-control or manual-control shaft for the transmission of motion in either direction. The construction of a ﬂexible shaft is shown in Fig. 17–24. The cable is made by winding several layers of wire around a central core. For the power-drive shaft, rotation should be in a direction such that the outer layer is wound up. Remote-control cables Figure 17–24 Flexible shaft: ( a) construction details; ( b) a variety of conﬁgurations. (Courtesy of S. S. White Technologies, Inc.) Mandrel (a) (b)First Layer (4 Wires)Last Layer (7 Wires)bud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/21/09 8:46 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Flexible Mechanical Elements 925 have a different lay of the wires forming the cable, with more wires in each layer, so that the torsional deﬂection is approximately the same for either direction of rotation. Flexible shafts are rated by specifying the torque corresponding to various radii of curvature of the casing. A 15-in radius of curvature, for example, will give from 2 to 5 times more torque capacity than a 7-in radius. When ﬂexible shafts are used in a drive in which gears are also used, the gears should be placed so that the ﬂexible shaft runs at as high a speed as possible. This permits the transmission of the maximum amount of horsepower. PROBLEMS 17–1 A 6-in-wide polyamide F-1 ﬂat belt is used to connect a 2-in-diameter pulley to drive a larger pulley with an angular velocity ratio of 0.5. The center-to-center distance is 9 ft.

Examine Fig. 17–7 and develop an expression for the load the belt places on the pulley, and then apply it to Ex. 17–2. 17–8 Example 17–2 resulted in selection of a 10-in-wide A-3 polyamide ﬂat belt.

Pulley Ais driven by a vertical belt from the motor pulley. A belt from pulley Bdrives a machine tool at an angle of 70◦from the vertical and at a center-to-center distance of 9 ft. Another belt from pulley Cdrives a grinder at a center-to-center distance of 11 ft. Pulley Chas a double width to permit belt shifting as shown in Fig. 17–4. The belt from pulley D drives a dust-extractor fan whose axis is located horizontally 8 ft from the axis of the lineshaft. Additional data are The power requirements, listed above, account for the overall efﬁciencies of the equipment. The two line-shaft bearings are mounted on hangers suspended from two overhead wide-ﬂange beams. Select the belt types and sizes for each of the four drives. Make provision for replacing belts from time to time because of wear or permanent stretch. 17–10 Two shafts 20 ft apart, with axes in the same horizontal plane, are to be connected with a ﬂat belt in which the driving pulley, powered by a six-pole squirrel-cage induction motor with a 100 brake hp rating at 1140 rev/min, drives the second shaft at half its angular speed. The driven shaft drives light-shock machinery loads. Select a ﬂat belt.bud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/21/09 8:46 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Flexible Mechanical Elements 927 17–11 The mechanical efﬁciency of a ﬂat-belt drive is approximately 98 percent. Because of its high value, the efﬁciency is often neglected. If a designer should choose to include it, where would he or she insert it in the ﬂat-belt protocol? 17–12 In metal belts, the centrifugal tension Fcis ignored as negligible. Convince yourself that this is a reasonable problem simpliﬁcation. 17–13 A designer has to select a metal-belt drive to transmit a power of Hnomunder circumstances where a service factor of Ksand a design factor of ndare appropriate. The design goal becomes Hd=HnomKsnd. Use Eq.

The circumstances are such that a service factor of 1.2 and a design factor of 1.05 are appropriate. The life goal is 106belt passes, f=0.35,and the environmental considerations require a stainless steel belt. 17–15 A beryllium-copper metal ﬂat belt with Sf=56.67kpsi is to transmit 5 hp at 1125 rev/min with a life goal of 106belt passes between two shafts 20 in apart whose centerlines are in a horizontal plane. The coefﬁcient of friction between belt and pulley is 0.32. The conditions are such that a service factor of 1.25 and a design factor of 1.1 are appropriate. The driven shaft rotates at one- third the motor-pulley speed. Specify your belt, pulley sizes, and initial tension at installation. 17–16 For the conditions of Prob. 17–15 use a 1095 plain carbon-steel heat-treated belt. Conditions at the driving pulley hub require a pulley outside diameter of 3 in or more. Specify your belt, pulley sizes, and initial tension at installation. 17–17 A single V belt is to be selected to deliver engine power to the wheel-drive transmission of a riding tractor. A 5-hp single-cylinder engine is used. At most, 60 percent of this power is transmitted to the belt. The driving sheave has a diameter of 6.2 in, the driven, 12.0 in. The belt selected should be as close to a 92-in pitch length as possible. The engine speed is governor-controlled to a maximum of 3100 rev/min. Select a satisfactory belt and assess the factor of safety and the belt life in passes. 17–18 Two B85 V belts are used in a drive composed of a 5.4-in driving sheave, rotating at 1200 rev/min, and a 16-in driven sheave. Find the power capacity of the drive based on a service factor of 1.25, and ﬁnd the center-to-center distance. 17–19 A 60-hp four-cylinder internal combustion engine is used to drive a brick-making machine under a schedule of two shifts per day. The drive consists of two 26-in sheaves spaced about 12 ft apart, with a sheave speed of 400 rev/min. Select a V-belt arrangement. Find the factor of safety, and estimate the life in passes and hours. 17–20 A reciprocating air compressor has a 5-ft-diameter ﬂywheel 14 in wide, and it operates at 170 rev/min. An eight-pole squirrel-cage induction motor has nameplate data 50 bhp at 875 rev/min. (a) Design a V-belt drive. (b) Can cutting the V-belt grooves in the ﬂywheel be avoided by using a V-ﬂat drive? 17–21 The geometric implications of a V-ﬂat drive are interesting.

Select a V-belt drive for this application and specify standard V belts, sheave sizes, and the resulting center-to-center distance. The motor size limits the center distance to at least 22 in. 17–23 The standard roller-chain number indicates the chain pitch in inches, construction proportions, series, and number of strands as follows: 100H-2 two strands heavy series standard proportions pitch is 10/8 in This convention makes the pitch directly readable from the chain number.

A service factor Ksof 1.5 and a design factor of 1.1 are appropriate. The pump speed is 140 rev/min. Select a suitable chain and sprocket sizes. 17–28 A centrifugal pump is driven by a 50-hp synchronous motor at a speed of 1800 rev/min. The pump is to operate at 900 rev/min.

Computer Programs In approaching the ensuing computer problems, the following suggestions may be helpful: •Decide whether an analysis program or a design program would be more useful. In problems as simple as these, you will ﬁnd the programs similar. For maximum instructional beneﬁt, try the design problem. •Creating a design program without a ﬁgure of merit precludes ranking alternative designs but does not hinder the attainment of satisfactory designs. Your instructor can provide the class design library with commercial catalogs, which not only have price information but deﬁne available sizes.bud29281_ch17_879-932.qxd 12/21/09 8:46 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:930 Mechanical Engineering Design •Quantitative understanding and logic of interrelations are required for programming. Difﬁculty in programming is a signal to you and your instructor to increase your understand- ing. The following programs can be accomplished in 100 to 500 lines of code. •Make programs interactive and user-friendly. •Let the computer do what it can do best; the user should do what a human can do best. •Assume the user has a copy of the text and can respond to prompts for information. •If interpolating in a table is in order, solicit table entries in the neighborhood, and let the computer crunch the numbers. •In decision steps, allow the user to make the necessary decision, even if it is undesirable.

An efﬁcient means of trans- mitting power is through rotary motion of a shaft that is supported by bearings. Gears, belt pulleys, or chain sprockets may be incorporated to provide for torque and speed changes between shafts. Most shafts are cylindrical (solid or hollow), and include stepped diame- ters with shoulders to accommodate the positioning and support of bearings, gears, etc. The design of a system to transmit power requires attention to the design and selec- tion of individual components (gears, bearings, shaft, etc.). However, as is often the case in design, these components are not independent. For example, in order to design the shaft for stress and deﬂection, it is necessary to know the applied forces. If the forces are transmitted through gears, it is necessary to know the gear speciﬁcations in order to determine the forces that will be transmitted to the shaft. But stock gears come with cer- tain bore sizes, requiring knowledge of the necessary shaft diameter. It is no surprise that the design process is interdependent and iterative, but where should a designer start? The nature of machine design textbooks is to focus on each component separately. This chapter will focus on an overview of a power transmission system design, demonstrating how to incorporate the details of each component into an overall design process. A typical two-stage gear reduction such as shown in Fig. 18–1 will be assumed for this discussion. The design sequence is similar for variations of this particular transmission system. The following outline will help clarify a logical design sequence. Discussion of how each part of the outline affects the overall design process will be given in sequence in this chapter. Details on the speciﬁcs for designing and selecting major components are covered in separate chapters, particularly Chap. 7 on shaft design, Chap. 11 on bear- ing selection, and Chaps. 13 and 14 on gear speciﬁcation. A complete case study is pre- sented as a speciﬁc vehicle to demonstrate the process. 32 5 4Y2 5 3 4Figure 18–1 A compound reverted gear train. CASE STUDY PART 1 PROBLEM SPECIFICATION Section 1–17, p. 24, presents the background for this case study involving a speed reducer. A two-stage, compound reverted gear train such as shown in Fig. 18–1 will be designed. In this chapter, the design of the intermediate shaft and its components is presented, taking into account the other shafts as necessary.bud29281_ch18_933-951.qxd 12/22/09 5:17 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Power Transmission Case Study 935 18–1 Design Sequence for Power Transmission There is not a precise sequence of steps for any design process. By nature, design is an iterative process in which it is necessary to make some tentative choices, and to build a skeleton of a design, and to determine which parts of the design are critical. However, much time can be saved by understanding the dependencies between the parts of the problem, allowing the designer to know what parts will be affected by any given change. In this section, only an outline is presented, with a short explanation of each step. Further details will be discussed in the following sections. •Power and torque requirements. Power considerations should be addressed ﬁrst, as this will determine the overall sizing needs for the entire system. Any necessary speed or torque ratio from input to output must be determined before addressing gear/pulley sizing. •Gear speciﬁcation. Necessary gear ratios and torque transmission issues can now be addressed with selection of appropriate gears. Note that a full force analysis of the shafts is not yet needed, as only the transmitted loads are required to specify the gears. •Shaft layout. The general layout of the shaft, including axial location of gears and bearings must now be speciﬁed. Decisions on how to transmit the torque from the gears to the shaft need to be made (keys, splines, etc.), as well as how to hold gears and bearings in place (retaining rings, press ﬁts, nuts, etc.). However, it is not neces- sary at this point to size these elements, since their standard sizes allow estimation of stress-concentration factors. •Force analysis. Once the gear/pulley diameters are known, and the axial locations of the gears and bearings are known, the free-body, shear force, and bending moment diagrams for the shafts can be produced. Forces at the bearings can be determined. •Shaft material selection. Since fatigue design depends so heavily on the material choice, it is usually easier to make a reasonable material selection ﬁrst, then check for satisfactory results. •Shaft design for stress (fatigue and static). At this point, a stress design of the shaft should look very similar to a typical design problem from the shaft chapter (Chap. 7). Shear force and bending moment diagrams are known, critical locations can be pre- dicted, approximate stress concentrations can be used, and estimates for shaft diame- ters can be determined.A subset of the pertinent design specifications that will be needed for this part of the design are given here. Power to be delivered: 20 hp Input speed: 1750 rpm Output speed: 82–88 rev/min Usually low shock levels, occasional moderate shock Input and output shafts extend 4 in outside gearbox Maximum gearbox size: 14-in /H1154714-in base, 22-in height Output shaft and input shaft in-line Gear and bearing life /H1102212 000 hours; infinite shaft lifebud29281_ch18_933-951.qxd 12/21/09 9:57 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:936 Mechanical Engineering Design •Shaft design for deflection. Since deflection analysis is dependent on the entire shaft geometry, it is saved until this point. With all shaft geometry now estimated, the critical deflections at the bearing and gear locations can be checked by analysis. •Bearing selection. Speciﬁc bearings from a catalog may now be chosen to match the estimated shaft diameters. The diameters can be adjusted slightly as necessary to match the catalog speciﬁcations. •Key and retaining ring selection. With shaft diameters settling in to stable values, appropriate keys and retaining rings can be speciﬁed in standard sizes. This should make little change in the overall design if reasonable stress-concentration factors were assumed in previous steps. •Final analysis. Once everything has been speciﬁed, iterated, and adjusted as neces- sary for any speciﬁc part of the task, a complete analysis from start to ﬁnish will pro- vide a ﬁnal check and speciﬁc safety factors for the actual system. 18–2 Power and Torque Requirements Power transmission systems will typically be speciﬁed by a power capacity, for example, a 40-horsepower gearbox. This rating speciﬁes the combination of torque and speed that the unit can endure. Remember that, in the ideal case, power in equals power out, so that we can refer to the power being the same throughout the system. In reality, there are small losses due to factors like friction in the bearings and gears. In many transmission systems, the losses in the rolling bearings will be negligible. Gears have a reasonably high efﬁciency, with about 1 to 2 percent power loss in a pair of meshed gears. Thus, in the double-reduction gearbox in Fig. 18–1, with two pairs of meshed gears the output power is likely to be about 2 to 4 percent less than the input power. Since this is a small loss, it is common to speak of simply the power of the system, rather than input power and output power. Flat belts and timing belts have efﬁciencies typically in the mid to upper 90 percent range. V belts and worm gears have efﬁciencies that may dip much lower, requiring a distinction between the necessary input power to obtain a desired output power. Torque, on the other hand, is typically not constant throughout a transmission system. Remember that power equals the product of torque and speed. Since power in /H11005 power out, we know that for a gear train H=Tiωi=Toωo (18–1) With a constant power, a gear ratio to decrease the angular velocity will simulta- neously increase torque. The gear ratio, or train value, for the gear train is e=ωo/ωi=Ti/To (18–2) A typical power transmission design problem will specify the desired power capac- ity, along with either the input and output angular velocities, or the input and output torques. There will usually be a tolerance speciﬁed for the output values. After the spe- ciﬁc gears are speciﬁed, the actual output values can be determined. 18–3 Gear Speciﬁcation With the gear train value known, the next step is to determine appropriate gears. As a rough guideline, a train value of up to 10 to 1 can be obtained with one pair of gears. Greater ratios can be obtained by compounding additional pairs of gears (See Sec. 13–13, p. 698). The compound reverted gear train in Fig. 18–1 can obtain a train value of up to 100 to 1.bud29281_ch18_933-951.qxd 12/21/09 9:57 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Power Transmission Case Study 937 Since numbers of teeth on gears must be integers, it is best to design with teeth num- bers rather than diameters. See Ex. 13–3, 13–4, and 13–5, pp. 700–702, for details on designing appropriate numbers of teeth to satisfy the gear train value and any necessary geometry condition, such as in-line condition of input and output shaft. Care should be taken at this point to ﬁnd the best combination of teeth numbers to minimize the overall package size. If the train value only needs to be approximate, use this ﬂexibility to try dif- ferent options of teeth numbers to minimize the package size. A difference of one tooth on the smallest gear can result in a signiﬁcant increase in size of the overall package. If designing for large production quantities, gears can be purchased in large enough quantities that it is not necessary to worry about preferred sizes. For small lot production, consideration should be given to the tradeoffs between smaller gearbox size and extra cost for odd gear sizes that are difﬁcult to purchase off the shelf. If stock gears are to be used, their availability in prescribed numbers of teeth with anticipated diametral pitch should be checked at this time. If necessary, iterate the design for numbers of teeth that are available. CASE STUDY PART 2 SPEED, TORQUE, AND GEAR RATIOS Continue the case study by determining appropriate tooth counts to reduce the input speed of ωi=1750 rev/min to an output speed within the range 82 rev/min /H11021 ωo/H11021 88 rev/min Once final tooth counts are specified, determine values of (a) Speeds for the intermediate and output shafts (b) Torques for the input, intermediate and output shafts, to transmit 20 hp.

For example, from Fig. 18–1, the overall height of the gearbox is Y=d3+d2/2+d5/2+2/P+clearances +wall thicknesses where the 2/ Pterm accounts for the addendum height of the teeth on gears 2 and 5 that extend beyond the pitch diameters. Substituting di=Ni/Pgives Y=N3/P+N2/(2P)+N5/(2P)+2/P+clearances +wall thicknesses Solving this for P, we ﬁnd P=(N3+N2/2+N5/2+2)/(Y−clearances −wall thicknesses )(18–3)bud29281_ch18_933-951.qxd 12/21/09 9:57 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Power Transmission Case Study 939 This is the minimum value that can be used for diametral pitch, and therefore the max- imum tooth size, to stay within the overall gearbox constraint. It should be rounded up to the next standard diametral pitch, which reduces the maximum tooth size. The AGMA approach, as described in Chap. 14, for both bending and contact stress should be applied next to determine suitable gear parameters. The primary design parameters to be speciﬁed by the designer include material, diametral pitch, and face width. A recommended procedure is to start with an estimated diametral pitch. This allows determination of gear diameters (d=N/P), pitch-line velocities [Eq. (13–34), p. 707], and transmitted loads [Eq. (13–35) or (13–36), p. 707]. Typical spur gears are available with face widths from 3 to 5 times the circular pitch p.Using an average of 4, a ﬁrst estimate can be made for face width F=4p=4π/P. Alternatively, the designer can simply perform a quick search of on-line gear catalogs to ﬁnd available face widths for the diametral pitch and number of teeth. Next, the AGMA equations in Chap. 14 can be used to determine appropriate mate- rial choices to provide desired safety factors. It is generally most efﬁcient to attempt to analyze the most critical gear ﬁrst, as it will determine the limiting values of diametral pitch and material strength. Usually, the critical gear will be the smaller gear, on the high-torque (low-speed) end of the gearbox. If the required material strengths are too high, such that they are either too expensive or not available, iteration with a smaller diametral pitch (larger tooth) will help. Of course, this will increase the overall gearbox size. Often the excessive stress will be in one of the small gears. Rather than increase the tooth size for all gears, it is sometimes better to reconsider the design of tooth counts, shifting more of the gear ratio to the pair of gears with less stress, and less ratio to the pair of gears with the excessive stress. This will allow the offending gear to have more teeth and therefore larger diameter, decreasing its stress. If contact stress turns out to be more limiting than bending stress, consider gear materials that have been heat treated or case hardened to increase the surface strength. Adjustments can be made to the diametral pitch if necessary to achieve a good balance of size, material, and cost. If the stresses are all much lower than the material strengths, a larger diametral pitch is in order, which will reduce the size of the gears and the gearbox. Everything up to this point should be iterated until acceptable results are obtained, as this portion of the design process can usually be accomplished independently from the next stages of the process. The designer should be satisﬁed with the gear selection before proceeding to the shaft. Selection of speciﬁc gears from catalogs at this point will be helpful in later stages, particularly in knowing overall width, bore size, recom- mended shoulder support, and maximum ﬁllet radius.

If there is no existing design to use as a starter, then the deter- mination of the shaft layout may have many solutions. Section 7–3, p. 361, discusses the issues involved in shaft layout. In this section the focus will be on how the decisions relate to the overall process. A free-body force analysis can be performed without knowing shaft diameters, but can not be performed without knowing axial distances between gears and bearings. It is extremely important to keep axial distances small. Even small forces can create large bending moments if the moment arms are large. Also, recall that beam deﬂection equa- tions typically include length terms raised to the third power. It is worth examining the entirety of the gearbox at this time, to determine what factors drive the length of the shaft and the placement of the components. A rough sketch, such as shown in Fig. 18–2, is sufﬁcient for this purpose.bud29281_ch18_933-951.qxd 12/21/09 9:57 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:944 Mechanical Engineering Design CASE STUDY PART 4 SHAFT LAYOUT Continue the case study by preparing a sketch of the gearbox sufficient to determine the axial dimensions. In particular, estimate the overall length, and the distance between the gears of the intermediate shaft, in order to fit with the mounting requirements of the other shafts. Solution Fig. 18–2 shows the rough sketch. It includes all three shafts, with consideration of how the bearings are to mount in the case. The gear widths are known at this point. Bearing widths are guessed, allowing a little more space for larger bearings on the intermediate shaft where bending moments will be greater. Small changes in bearing widths will have minimal effect on the force analysis, since the location of the ground reaction force will change very little. The 4-in distance between the two gears on the countershaft is dictated by the requirements of the input and output shafts, including the space for the case to mount the bearings. Small allotments are given for the retaining rings, and for space behind the bearings. Adding it all up gives the intermediate shaft length as 11.5 in. Figure 18–2 Sketch for shaft layout. Dimensions are in inches.1 21 23 43 4 4 2 1 3 411 23 41 1 41 411 2bud29281_ch18_933-951.qxd 12/21/09 9:57 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Power Transmission Case Study 945 Wider face widths on gears require more shaft length. Originally, gears with hubs were considered for this design to allow the use of set screws instead of high-stress- concentration retaining rings. However, the extra hub lengths added several inches to the shaft lengths and the gearbox housing. Several points are worth noting in the layout in Fig. 18–2. The gears and bearings are positioned against shoulders, with retaining rings to hold them in position. While it is desirable to place gears near the bearings, a little extra space is provided between them to accommodate any housing that extends behind the bearing, and to allow for a bearing puller to have space to access the back of the bearing. The extra change in diameter between the bearings and the gears allows the shoulder height for the bearing and the bore size for the gear to be different. This diameter can have loose tolerances and large ﬁllet radius. Each bearing is restrained axially on its shaft, but only one bearing on each shaft is axially fixed in the housing, allowing for slight axial thermal expansion of the shafts. 18–5 Force Analysis Once the gear diameters are known, and the axial locations of the components are set, the free-body diagrams and shear force and bending moment diagrams for the shafts can be produced. With the known transmitted loads, determine the radial and axial loads transmitted through the gears (see Secs. 13–14 through 13–17, pp. 705–714). From summation of forces and moments on each shaft, ground reaction forces at the bearings can be determined. For shafts with gears and pulleys, the forces and moments will usually have components in two planes along the s haft. For rotating shafts, usu- ally only the resultant magnitude is needed, so force components at bearings are summed as vectors. Shear force and bending moment diagrams are usually obtained in two planes, then summed as vectors at any point of interest. A torque diagram should also be generated to clearly visualize the transfer of torque from an input component, through the shaft, and to an output component. See the beginning of Ex. 7–2, p. 374, for the force analysis portion of the case study for the intermediate shaft. The bending moment is largest at gear 4. This is predictable, since gear 4 is smaller, and must transmit the same torque that entered the shaft through the much larger gear 3. While the force analysis is not difﬁcult to perform manually, if beam software is to be used for the deﬂection analysis, it will necessarily calculate reaction forces, along with shear force and bending moment diagrams in the process of calculating deﬂec- tions. The designer can enter guessed values for diameters into the software at this point, just to get the force information, and later enter actual diameters to the same model to determine deﬂections. 18–6 Shaft Material Selection A trial material for the shaft can be selected at any point before the stress design of the shaft, and can be modiﬁed as necessary during the stress design process. Section 7–2, p. 360, provides details for decisions regarding material selection. For the case study, an inexpensive steel, 1020 CD, is initially selected. After the stress analysis, a slightly higher strength 1050 CD is chosen to reduce the critical stresses without further increasing the shaft diameters.bud29281_ch18_933-951.qxd 12/21/09 9:57 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:946 Mechanical Engineering Design 18–7 Shaft Design for Stress The critical shaft diameters are to be determined by stress analysis at critical locations. Section 7–4, p. 366, provides a detailed examination of the issues involved in shaft design for stress. CASE STUDY PART 5 DESIGN FOR STRESS Proceed with the next phase of the case study design, in which appropriate diam- eters for each section of the shaft are estimated, based on providing sufficient fatigue and static stress capacity for infinite life of the shaft, with minimum safety factor of 1.5. Solution The solution to this phase of the design is presented in Ex. 7–2, p. 374. Since the bending moment is highest at gear 4, potentially critical stress points are at its shoulder, keyway, and retaining ring groove. It turns out that the keyway is the critical location. It seems that shoulders often get the most attention. This example demonstrates the danger of neglecting other stress concentration sources, such as keyways. The material choice was changed in the course of this phase, choosing to pay for a higher strength to limit the shaft diameter to 2 in. If the shaft were to get much bigger, the small gear would not be able to provide an adequate bore size. If it becomes neces- sary to increase the shaft diameter any more, the gearing speciﬁcation will need to be redesigned. 18–8 Shaft Design for Deﬂection Section 7–5, p. 379, provides a detailed discussion of deﬂection considerations for shafts. Typically, a deﬂection problem in a shaft will not cause catastrophic failure of the shaft, but will lead to excess noise and vibration, and premature failure of the gears or bearings. CASE STUDY PART 6 DEFLECTION CHECK Proceed with the next phase of the case study by checking that deflections and slopes at the gears and bearings on the intermediate shaft are within acceptable ranges. Solution The solution to this phase of the design is presented in Ex. 7–3, p. 380.bud29281_ch18_933-951.qxd 12/22/09 4:35 PM epg 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Power Transmission Case Study 947 It turns out that in this problem all the deﬂections are within recommended limits for bearings and gears. This is not always the case, and it would be a poor choice to neg- lect the deﬂection analysis. In a ﬁrst iteration of this case study, with longer shafts due to using gears with hubs, the deﬂections were more critical than the stresses. 18–9 Bearing Selection Bearing selection is straightforward now that the bearing reaction forces and the approximate bore diameters are known. See Chap. 11 for general details on bearing selection. Rolling-contact bearings are available with a wide range of load capacities and dimensions, so it is usually not a problem to ﬁnd a suitable bearing that is close to the estimated bore diameter and width. CASE STUDY PART 7 BEARING SELECTION Continue the case study by selecting appropriate bearings for the intermediate shaft, with a reliability of 99 percent. The problem specifies a design life of 12 000 h. The intermediate shaft speed is 389 rev/min. The estimated bore size is 1 in, and the estimated bearing width is 1 in. Solution From the free-body diagram (see Ex. 7–2, p. 374), RAz=115.0 lbf RAy=356.7 lbf RA=375 lbf RBz=1776.0 lbf RBy=725.3 lbf RB=1918 lbf At the shaft speed of 389 rev/min, the design life of 12 000 h correlates to a bearing life of LD=(12 000 h )(60 min /h)(389 rev /min)=2.8×108rev. Start with bearing B since it has the higher loads and will likely raise any lurking problems. From Eq. (11–7), p. 578, assuming a ball bearing with a=3 and L=2.8×106rev, FRB=1918/bracketleftBigg 2.8×108/106 0.02+4.439(1−0.99)1/1.483/bracketrightBigg1/3 =20 820 lbf A check on the Internet for available bearings (www.globalspec.com is one good starting place) shows that this load is relatively high for a ball bearing with bore size in the neighborhood of 1 in. Try a cylindrical roller bearing. Recalculating FRB with the exponent a=3/10for roller bearings, we obtain FRB=16 400 lbf Cylindrical roller bearings are available from several sources in this range. A spe- cific one is chosen from SKF, a common supplier of bearings, with the following specifications: Cylindrical roller bearing at right end of shaft C=18 658 lbf, ID=1.181 1 in, OD=2.834 6 in, W=1.063in Shoulder diameter =1.45 in to 1.53 in, and maximum ﬁllet radius =0.043 inbud29281_ch18_933-951.qxd 12/21/09 9:57 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:For bearing A, again assuming a ball bearing, FRA=375/bracketleftbigg2.8×108/106 0.02+4.439(1−0.99)1/1.483/bracketrightbigg1/3 =407 lbf A specific ball bearing is chosen from the SKF Internet catalog.

The gears are to be custom bored and keyed to the required specifications. Previously obtained information includes the following: Transmitted torque: T=3240 lbf-in Bore diameters: d3=d4=1.625in Gear hub lengths: l3=1.5in, l4=2.0inAt this point, the actual bearing dimensions can be checked against the initial assumptions. For bearing Bthe bore diameter of 1.1811 in is slightly larger than the original 1.0 in. There is no reason for this to be a problem as long as there is room for the shoulder diameter. The original estimate for shoulder support diameters was 1.4 in. As long as this diameter is less than 1.625 in, the next step of the shaft, there should not be any problem. In the case study, the recommended shoulder support diameters are within the acceptable range. The original estimates for stress concentration at the bear- ing shoulder assumed a ﬁllet radius such that r/d=0.02. The actual bearings selected have ratios of 0.036 and 0.080. This allows the ﬁllet radii to be increased from the orig- inal design, decreasing the stress-concentration factors. The bearing widths are close to the original estimates. Slight adjustments should be made to the shaft dimensions to match the bearings. No redesign should be necessary. 18–10 Key and Retaining Ring Selection The sizing and selection of keys is discussed in Sec. 7–7, p. 388, with an example in Ex. 7–6, p. 394. The cross-sectional size of the key will be dictated to correlate with the shaft size (see Tables 7–6 and 7–8, pp. 391, 393), and must certainly match an integral keyway in the gear bore. The design decision includes the length of the key, and if nec- essary an upgrade in material choice. The key could fail by shearing across the key, or by crushing due to bearing stress. For a square key, it turns out that checking only the crushing failure is adequate, since the shear- ing failure will be less critical according to the distortion energy failure theory, and equal according to the maximum shear stress failure theory. Check Ex. 7–6 to investigate why.bud29281_ch18_933-951.qxd 12/21/09 9:57 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Power Transmission Case Study 949 Retaining ring selection is simply a matter of checking catalog speciﬁcations. The retaining rings are listed for nominal shaft diameter, and are available with different axial load capacities. Once selected, the designer should make note of the depth of the groove, the width of the groove, and the ﬁllet radius in the bottom of the groove. The catalog speciﬁcation for the retaining ring also includes an edge margin, which is the min- imum distance to the next smaller diameter change. This is to ensure support for the axial load carried by the ring. It is important to ch eck stress-concentration factors with actual dimensions, as these factors can be rather large. In the case study, a speciﬁc retaining ring was already chosen during the stress analysis (see Ex. 7–2, p. 374) at the potentially critical location of gear 4. The other locations for retaining rings were not at points of high stress, so it is not necessary to worry about the stress concentration due to the retaining rings in these locations. Speciﬁc retaining rings should be selected at this time to complete the dimensional speciﬁcations of the shaft. For the case study, retaining rings speciﬁcations are entered into globalspec, and speciﬁc rings are selected from Truarc Co., with the following speciﬁcations:Solution From Table 7–6, p. 391, for a shaft diameter of 1.625 in, choose a square key with side dimension t=3 8in. Choose 1020 CD material, with Sy=57kpsi. The force on the key at the surface of the shaft is F=T r=3240 1.625/2=3988 lbf Checking for failure by crushing, we find the area of one-half the face of the key is used. n=Sy σ=Sy F/(tl/2) Solving for lgives l=2Fn tSy=2(3988)(2) (0.375)(57000)=0.75 in Since both gears have the same bore diameter and transmit the same torque, the same key specification can be used for both.

Final details include deter- mining dimensions and tolerances for appropriate ﬁts with the gears and bearings. See Section 7–8, p. 395, for details on obtaining speciﬁc ﬁts. Any small changes from the nominal diameters already speciﬁed will have negligible effect on the stress and deﬂec- tion analysis. However, for manufacturing and assembly purposes, the designer should not overlook the tolerance speciﬁcation. Improper ﬁts can lead to failure of the design. The ﬁnal drawing for the intermediate shaft is shown in Fig. 18–3. For documentation purposes, and for a check on the design work, the design process should conclude with a complete analysis of the ﬁnal design. Remember that analysis is much more straightforward than design, so the investment of time for the ﬁnal analysis will be relatively small. PROBLEMS 18–1 For the case study problem, design the input shaft, including complete speciﬁcation of the gear, bearings, key, retaining rings, and shaft. 18–2 For the case study problem, design the output shaft, including complete speciﬁcation of the gear, bearings, key, retaining rings, and shaft. 18–3 For the case study problem, use helical gears and design the intermediate shaft.

Actual com- ponents, however, are rarely so simple, and the designer is forced to less effective approximations of closed-form solutions, experimentation, or numerical methods. There are a great many numerical techniques used in engineering applications for which the digital computer is very useful. In mechanical design, where computer-aided design (CAD) software is heavily employed, the analysis method that integrates well with CAD is ﬁnite-element analysis (FEA). The mathematical theory and applications of the method are vast. There is also a number of commercial FEA software packages that are available, such as ANSYS, NASTRAN, Algor, etc. The purpose of this chapter is only to expose the reader to some of the fundamen- tal aspects of FEA, and therefore the coverage is extremely introductory in nature. For further detail, the reader is urged to consult the many references cited at the end of this chapter. Figure 19–1 shows a ﬁnite-element model of a connecting rod that was developed to study the effects of dynamic elastohydrodynamic lubrication on bearing and structural performance.1 There are a multitude of FEA applications such as static and dynamic, linear and nonlinear, stress and deﬂection analysis; free and forced vibrations; heat transfer (which can be combined with stress and deﬂection analysis to provide thermally induced stresses and deﬂections); elastic instability (buckling); acoustics; electrostatics and 1S.

For purposes of this chapter, we will limit ourselves to basic mechan- ics analyses. An actual mechanical component is a continuous elastic structure (continuum). FEA divides (discretizes) the structure into small but ﬁnite, well-deﬁned, elastic sub- structures (elements). By using polynomial functions, together with matrix operations, the continuous elastic behavior of each element is developed in terms of the element’s material and geometric properties. Loads can be applied within the element (gravity, dynamic, thermal, etc.), on the surface of the element, or at the nodes of the element. The element’s nodes are the fundamental governing entities of the element, as it is the node where the element connects to other elements, where elastic properties of the element are eventually established, where boundary conditions are assigned, and where forces (con- tact or body) are ultimately applied. A node possesses degrees of freedom (dof’s). Degrees of freedom are the independent translational and rotational motions that can exist at a node. At most, a node can pos sess three translational and three rotational degrees of free- dom. Once each element within a structure is deﬁned locally in matrix form, the ele- ments are then globally assembled (attached) through their common nodes (dof’s) into an overall system matrix. Applied loads and boundary conditions are then speciﬁed and through matrix operations the values of all unknown displacement degrees of freedom are determined. Once this is done, it is a simple matter to use these displacements to determine strains and stresses through the constitutive equations of elasticity. 19–1 The Finite-Element Method The modern development of the ﬁnite-element method began in the 1940s in the ﬁeld of structural mechanics with the work of Hrennikoff,2McHenry,3and Newmark,4who used a lattice of line elements (rods and beams) for the solution of stresses in con- tinuous solids. In 1943, from a 1941 lecture, Courant5suggested piecewise polynomial interpolation over triangular subregions as a method to model torsional problems. With the advent of digital computers in the 1950s it became practical for engineers to write and solve the stiffness equations in matrix form.6,7,8A classic paper by Turner, Clough, Martin, and Topp published in 1956 presented the matrix stiffness equations for the 2A.

The major advances in computer technology include the rapidly expanding computer hardware capabilities, efﬁcient and accurate matrix solver routines, and computer graphics for ease in the visual preprocessing stages of model building, including automatic adaptive mesh generation, and in the postprocessing stages of revie wing the solution results. A great abundance of literature has been presented on the subject, including many textbooks. A partial list of some textbooks, introductory and more comprehensiv e, is given at the end of this chapter. Since the ﬁnite-element method is a numerical technique that discretizes the domain of a continuous structure, errors are inevitable. These errors are: 1Computational errors. These are due to round-off errors from the computer ﬂoating-point calculations and the formulations of the numerical integration schemes that are employed. Most commercial ﬁnite-element codes concentrate on reducing these errors, and consequently the analyst generally is concerned with discretization factors. 2Discretization errors. The geometry and the displacement distribution of a true structure continuously vary. Using a ﬁnite number of elements to model the struc- ture introduces errors in matching geometry and the displacement distribution due to the inherent mathematical limitations of the elements. For an example of discretization errors, consider the constant thickness, thin plate structure shown in Fig. 19–2 a. Figure 19–2 bshows a finite-element model (a)(b) Figure 19–2 Structural problem.

This element type has a flaw that creates two basic problems. The element has straight sides that remain straight after deformation. The strains throughout the plane stress triangular element are constant. The ﬁrst problem, a geometric one, is the mod- eling of curved edges. Note that the surface of the model with a large curvature appears poorly modeled, whereas the surface of the hole seems to be reasonably modeled. The second problem, which is much more severe, is that the strains in various regions of the actual structure are changing rapidly, and the constant strain element will provide only an approximation of the average strain at the center of the element. So, in a nutshell, the results predicted by this model will be extremely poor. The results can be improved by significantly increasing the number of elements (increased mesh density). Alternatively, using a better element, such as an eight- node quadrilateral, which is more suited to the application, will provide the improved results. Because of higher-order interpolation functions, the eight-node quadrilateral element can model curved edges and provide for a higher-order function for the strain distribution. In Fig. 19–2 b, the triangular elements are shaded and the nodes of the elements are represented by the black dots. Forces and constraints can be placed only at the nodes. The nodes of a simplex triangular plane stress elements have only two degrees of free- dom, translation in the plane. Thus, the solid black, simple support triangles on the left edge represent the ﬁxed support of the model. Also, the distributed load can be applied only to three nodes as shown. The modeled load has to be statically consistent with the actual load. 19–2 Element Geometries Many geometric shapes of elements are used in finite-element analysis for specific applications. The various elements used in a general-purpose commercial FEM soft- ware code constitute what is referred to as the element library of the code. Elements can be placed in the following categories: line elements ,surface elements , solid ele- ments , and special-purpose elements .

Not all elements support all degrees of freedom. For example, the 3-D truss element sup- ports only three translational degrees of freedom at each node. Connecting elements with differing dof’s generally requires some manual modification. For example, con- sider connecting a truss element to a frame element. The frame element supports all six dof’s at each node. A truss member, when connected to it, can rotate freely at the connection. 19–3 The Finite-Element Solution Process We will describe the ﬁnite-element solution process on a very simple one-dimensional problem, using the linear truss element. A truss element is a bar loaded in tension or compression and is of constant cross-sectional area A, length l, and elastic modulus E. The basic truss element has two nodes, and for a one-dimensional problem, each node will have only one degree of freedom. A truss element can be modeled as a simple linear spring with a spring rate, given by Eq. (4–4) as k=AE l(19–1) Consider a spring element ( e) of spring rate ke, with nodes iand j, as shown in Fig. 19–3. Nodes and elements will be numbered. So, to avoid confusion as to what a number corresponds to, elements will be numbered within parentheses. Assuming all forces fand displacements udirected toward the right as positive, the forces at each node can be written as fi,e=ke/parenleftbig ui−uj/parenrightbig =keui−keuj fj,e=ke/parenleftbig uj−ui/parenrightbig =−keui+keuj(19–2) The two equations can be written in matrix form as /braceleftbigg fi,e fi,e/bracerightbigg =/bracketleftbigg ke−ke −ke ke/bracketrightbigg/braceleftbigg ui uj/bracerightbigg (19–3) Next, consider a two-spring system as shown in Fig. 19–4 a. Here we have num- bered the nodes and elements. We have also labeled the forces at each node. However, these forces are the total external forces at each node, F1, F2, and F3. If we draw separate free-body diagrams we will expose the internal forces as shown in Fig. 19–4 b. fi,eike ui ujj fj,e (e)bud29281_ch19_952-976.qxd 12/22/2009 1:03 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Using Eq.

For example, in Fig. 19–4 a, the displacement of node 1 at the wall is zero, so F1is the unknown reaction force (note, up to this point, we have not applied a static solution of the system). If we do not know the displacement of a node, then we know the force. For example, in Fig. 19–4 a, the displacements at nodes 2 and 3 are unknown, and the forces F2and F3are to be speciﬁed. To see how the remainder of the solution process can be implemented, let us consider the following example.960 Mechanical Engineering Design f1,1 u1k1 f2,1 f2,2 u2k2 f3,2 u3 u223F1k1F2 k2 F3 u3 u212 3 (1)(2) (2)(a) (b)1 2 (1) Figure 19–4 A two-element spring system.

The mesh density increases as more elements are placed within a given region. Mesh refinement is when the mesh is modified from one analysis of a model to the next analysis to yield improved results. Results generally improve when the mesh density is increased in areas of high stress gradients and/or when geometric transition zones are meshed smoothly. Generally, but not always, the FEA results converge toward the exact results as the mesh is continuously refined. To assess improvement, in regions where high stress gradients appear, the structure can be remeshed with a higher mesh density at this location. If there is a minimal change in the maximum stress value, it is reasonable to presume that the solution has converged. There are three basic ways to generate an element mesh, manually, semiautomatically, or fully automated. 1Manual mesh generation. This is how the element mesh was created in the early days of the finite-element method. This is a very labor intensive method of creating the mesh, and except for some quick modifications of a model is it rarely done. Note: Care must be exercised in editing an input text file. Withbud29281_ch19_952-976.qxd 12/23/09 5:42 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:some FEA software, other files such as the preprocessor binary graphics file may not change. Consequently, the files may no longer be compatible with each other. 2Semiautomatic mesh generation. Over the years, computer algorithms have been developed that enable the modeler to automatically mesh regions of the structure that he or she has divided up, using well-deﬁned boundaries. Since the modeler has to define these regions, the technique is deemed semiauto- matic . The development of the many computer algorithms for mesh generation emanates from the field of computer graphics. If the reader desires more infor- mation on this subject, a review the literature available from this field is recommended. 3Fully automated mesh generation. Many software vendors have concentrated their efforts on developing fully automatic mesh generation, and in some instances, automatic self-adaptive mesh refinement. The obvious goal is to significantly reduce the modeler's preprocessing time and effort to arrive at a final well-constructed FEA mesh. Once the complete boundary of the structure is defined, without subdivisions as in semiautomatic mesh generation and with a minimum of user intervention, various schemes are available to discretize the region with one element type . For plane elastic problems the boundary is defined by a series of internal and external geometric lines and the element type to be automeshed would be the plane elastic element. For thin-walled structures, the geometry would be defined by three-dimensional surface repre- sentations and the automeshed element type would be the three-dimensional plate element. For solid structures, the boundary could be constructed by using constructive solid geometry (CSG ) or boundary representation (B-rep ) tech- niques. The finite-element types for automeshing would be the brick and/or tetrahedron. Automatic self-adaptive mesh refinement programs estimate the error of the FEA solution. On the basis of the error, the mesh is automatically revised and rean- alyzed. The process is repeated until some convergence or termination criterion is satisfied. Returning to the thin-plate model of Fig. 19–2, the boundaries of the structure are constructed as shown in Fig. 19–6 a. The boundaries were then automeshed as shown in Fig. 19–6 b, where 294 elements and 344 nodes were generated. Note the uniformity of the element generation at the boundaries. The finite-element solver then generated the deflections and von Mises stresses shown in Fig. 19–6 c. The maximum von Mises stress at the location shown is 4110.4 psi. The model was then automeshed with an increased mesh density as shown in Fig. 19–6 d, where the model has 1008 elements and 1096 nodes. The results are shown in Fig. 19–6 ewhere the maximum von Mises stress is found to be 4184.9 psi, which is only 1.8 percent higher. In all likelihood, the solution has nearly converged. Note: The stress contours of Figs. 19–6 cand eare better visualized in color. When stress concentrations are present, it is necessary to have a very ﬁne mesh at the stres s-concentration region in order to get realistic results. What is important is that the mesh density needs to be increased only in the region around the stress concentration and that the transition mesh from the rest of the structure to the stress- concentration region be gradual. An abrupt mesh transition, in itself, will have the same effect as a stress concent ration. Stress concentration will be discussed further in Sec. 19–7, Modeling Techniques.Finite-Element Analysis 963bud29281_ch19_952-976.qxd 12/22/2009 1:03 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:964 Mechanical Engineering Design 4110.4 psi 4184.9 psi(a) (b)( c) (e) (d)Von Mises 4184.9 3588.2 2991.6 2394.9 1798.2 1201.6 604.91 8.2392Von Mises 4110.4 3524.8 2939.2 2353.6 1768.1 1182.5 596.91 11.341 Figure 19–6 Automatic meshing the thin-plate model of Fig. 19–2.

However, element loads are eventually applied to the nodes by using equiv- alent nodal loads. One aspect of load application is related to Saint-Venant’s princi- ple. If one is not concerned about the stresses near points of load application, it isbud29281_ch19_952-976.qxd 12/22/2009 1:03 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:not necessary to attempt to distribute the loading very precisely. The net force and/or moment can be applied to a single node, provided the element supports the dof asso- ciated with the force and/or moment at the node. However, the analyst should not be surprised, or concerned, when reviewing the results and the stresses in the vicinity of the load application point are found to be very large. Concentrated moments can be applied to the nodes of beam and most plate elements. However, concentrated moments cannot be applied to truss, two-dimensional plane elastic, axisymmetric, or brick elements. They do not support rotational degrees of freedom. A pure moment can be applied to these elements only by using forces in the form of a couple. From the mechanics of statics, a couple can be generated by using two or more forces act- ing in a plane where the net force from the forces is zero. The net moment from the forces is a vector perpendicular to the plane and is the summation of the moments from the forces taken about any common point. Element loads include static loads due to gravity (weight), thermal effects, surface loads such as uniform and hydrostatic pressure, and dynamic loads due to constant acceleration and steady-state rotation (centrifugal acceleration). As stated earlier, ele- ment loads are converted by the software to equivalent nodal loads and in the end are treated as concentrated loads applied to nodes. For gravity loading, the gravity constant in appropriate units and the direction of gravity must be supplied by the modeler. If the model length and force units are inches and lbf, g=386.1 ips2. If the model length and force units are meters and Newtons, g=9.81 m/s2. The gravity direction is normally toward the center of the earth. For thermal loading, the thermal expansion coefﬁcient /H9251must be given for each material, as well as the initial temperature of the structure, and the ﬁnal nodal temper- atures. Most software packages have the capability of ﬁrst performing a ﬁnite-element heat transfer analysis on the structure to determine the ﬁnal nodal temperatures. The temperature results are written to a ﬁle, which can be transferred to the static stress analysis. Here the heat transfer model should have the same nodes and element type the static stress analysis model has. Surface loading can generally be applied to most elements. For example, uniform or linear transverse line loads (force/length) can be speciﬁed on beams. Uniform and linear pressure can normally be applied on the edges of two-dimensional plane and axisymmetric elements. Lateral pressure can be applied on plate elements, and pressure can be applied on the surface of solid brick elements. Each software package has its unique manner in which to specify these surface loads, usually in a combination of text and graphic modes. 19–6 Boundary Conditions The simulation of boundary conditions and other forms of constraint is probably the single most difficult part of the accurate modeling of a structure for a finite- element analysis. In specifying constraints, it is relatively easy to make mistakes of omission or misrepresentation. It may be necessary for the analyst to test different approaches to model esoteric constraints such as bolted joints, welds, etc., which are not as simple as the idealized pinned or fixed joints. Testing should be confined to simple problems and not to a large, complex structure. Sometimes, when the exact nature of a boundary condition is uncertain, only limits of behavior may be possible. For example, we have modeled shafts with bearings as being simply sup- ported. It is more likely that the support is something between simply supported andFinite-Element Analysis 965bud29281_ch19_952-976.qxd 12/22/2009 1:03 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:fixed, and we could analyze both constraints to establish the limits. However, by assuming simply supported, the results of the solution are conservative for stress and deflections. That is, the solution would predict stresses and deflections larger than the actual. For another example, consider beam 16 in Table A–9. The horizontal beam is uniformly loaded and is fixed at both ends. Although not explicitly stated, tables such as these assume that the beams are not restrained in the horizontal direction. That is, it is assumed that the beam can slide horizontally in the supports. If the ends were completely or partially restrained, a beam-column solution would be neces- sary.12With a finite-element analysis, a special element, a beam with stiffening, could be used. Multipoint constraint equations are quite often used to model boundary conditions or rigid connections between elastic members. When used in the latter form, the equa- tions are acting as elements and are thus referred to as rigid elements. Rigid elements can rotate or translate only rigidly. Boundary elements are used to force speciﬁc nonzero displacements on a structure. Boundary elements can also be useful in modeling boundary conditions that are askew from the global coordinate system. 19–7 Modeling Techniques With today’s CAD packages and automatic mesh generators, it is an easy task to cre- ate a solid model and mesh the volume with finite elements. With today’s comput- ing speeds and with gobs of computer memory, it is very easy to create a model with extremely large numbers of elements and nodes. The finite-element modeling tech- niques of the past now seem passé and unnecessary. However, much unnecessary time can be spent on a very complex model when a much simpler model will do. The complex model may not even provide an accurate solution, whereas a simpler one will. What is important is what solution the analyst is looking for: deflections, stresses, or both? For example, consider the steel step-shaft of Ex. 4–7, repeated here as Fig. 19–7 a. Let the fillets at the steps have a radius of 0.02 in. If only deflections and slopes were sought at the steps, a highly meshed solid model would not yield much more than the simple five-element beam model, shown in Fig. 19–7 b, would. The fillets at the steps, which could not be modeled easily with beam elements, would not contribute much to a difference in results between the two models. Nodes are necessary wherever boundary conditions, applied forces, and changes in cross section and/or material occur. The displacement results for the FEA model are shown in Fig. 19–7 c. The FE model of Fig. 19–7 bis not capable of providing the stress at the ﬁllet of the step at D. Here, a full-blown solid model would have to be developed and meshed, using solid elements with a high mesh density at the ﬁllet as shown in Fig. 19–8 a. Here, the steps at the bearing supports are not modeled, as we are concerned only with the stress concentration at x=8.5in. The brick and tetrahedron elements do not support rotational966 Mechanical Engineering Design 12See R. B. Budynas, Advanced Strength and Applied Stress Analysis , 2nd ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1999, pp. 471 –482.bud29281_ch19_952-976.qxd 12/22/2009 1:03 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:degrees of freedom. To model the simply supported boundary condition at the left end, nodes along the zaxis were constrained from translating in the xand ydirections. Nodes along the yaxis were constrained from translating in the zdirection. Nodes on the right end on an axis parallel with the zaxis through the center of the shaft were constrained from translating in the ydirection, and nodes on an axis parallel with the yaxis through the center of the shaft were constrained from translating in the zdirection. This ensures no rigid-body translation or rotation and no overconstraint at the ends. The maximum tensile stress at the ﬁllet at the beam bottom is found to be σmax=23.9kpsi. Performing an analytical check at the step yields D/d=1.75/1.5=1.167, and r/d=0.02/1.5=0.0133 . Figure A–15–9 is not very accurate for these values.Finite-Element Analysis 967 y x 0.5 8 8.5 2019.5ABDCE F 1 (1) (2) ( 3) (4) ( 5)2 34 56R2 R11.000 dia1.500 dia1.750 dia 1.000 dia600 lbf (a) Dimensions in in ches (b) Figure 19–7 (a) Steel step shaft of Ex. 4–7; ( b) ﬁnite-element model using ﬁve beam elements; ( c) displacement results for FEA model.Node xy z /H9258x /H9258y /H9258z No. Translation Translation Translation Rotation (deg) Rotation (deg) Rotation (deg) 1 0.0000 E +00 0 .0000 E +00 0 .0000 E +00 0 .0000 E +00 0 .0000 E +00 −9.7930 E −02 2 0.0000 E +00 −8.4951 E −04 0 .0000 E +00 0 .0000 E +00 0 .0000 E +00 −9.6179 E −02 3 0.0000 E +00 −9.3649 E −03 0 .0000 E +00 0 .0000 E +00 0 .0000 E +00 −7.9874 E −03 4 0.0000 E +00 −9.3870 E −03 0 .0000 E +00 0 .0000 E +00 0 .0000 E +00 2 .8492 E −03 5 0.0000 E +00 −6.0507 E −04 0 .0000 E +00 0 .0000 E +00 0 .0000 E +00 6 .8558 E −02 6 0.0000 E +00 0 .0000 E +00 0 .0000 E +00 0 .0000 E +00 0 .0000 E +00 6 .9725 E −02 (c)Displacements/rotations (degrees) of nodesbud29281_ch19_952-976.qxd 12/23/09 5:04 PM epg Disk1:Desktop Folder:TEMPWORK:Don't-Delete Jobs:MHDQ196/Budynas:Resorting to another source,13the stress-concentration factor is found to be Kt=3.00.

This is 4.6 percent higher in magnitude than the /H110020.00938 in deﬂection for the three-element beam model,. For slopes, the brick ele- ment does not support rotational degrees of freedom, so the rotation at the ends has to be computed from the displacements of adjacent nodes at the ends. This results in the slopes at the ends of θA=−0.103◦and θF=0.0732◦; these are 6.7 and 6.6 percent higher in magnitude than the three-element beam model, respectively. However, the point of this exercise is, if deﬂections were the only result desired, which model would you use? There are countless modeling situations which could be examined. The reader is urged to read the literature, and peruse the tutorials available from the software vendors.14 19–8 Thermal Stresses A heat transfer analysis can be performed on a structural component including the effects of heat conduction, convection, and/or radiation. After the heat transfer analysis is completed, the same model can be used to determine the resulting thermal stresses. For sake of a simple illustration, we will model a 10 in×4i n, 0.25-in-thick steel plate with a centered 1.0-in-diameter hole. The plate is supported as shown in Fig. 19–9 a, and the temperatures of the ends are maintained at temperatures of 100◦Fand 0◦F. Other than at the walls, all surfaces are thermally insulated. Before placing the plate between the walls, the initial temperature of the plate was 0◦F. The thermal coefficient of expansion for steel is αs=6.5×10−6◦F−1. The plate was meshed with 1312 two-dimensional elements, with the mesh refined along the border of the hole. Figure 19–9 bshows the temperature contours of the steady-state temperature distribution obtained by the FEA. Using the same elements for a linear stress analysis, where the temperatures were transferred from the heat transfer analy- sis, Fig. 19–9 cshows the resulting stress contours. As expected, the maximum com- pressive stresses occurred at the top and bottom of the hole; with a magnitude of 31.9 kpsi. 19–9 Critical Buckling Load Finite elements can be used to predict the critical buckling load for a thin-walled struc- ture. An example was shown in Fig. 4–25 (p. 190). Another example can be seen in Fig. 19–10 a, which is a thin-walled aluminum beverage can. A speciﬁc pressure was applied to the top surface. The bottom of the can was constrained in translation verti- cally, the center node of the bottom of the can was constrained in translation in all three directions, and one outer node on the can bottom was constrained in translation tangentially. This prevents rigid-body motion, and provides vertical support for the bottom of the can with unconstrained motion of the bottom of the can horizontally. The ﬁnite element software returns a value of the load multiplier, which, when multiplied with the total applied force, indicates the critical buckling load.

The buckling mode shape for the buckled beverage can is shown in Fig. 19–10 b. 19–10 Vibration Analysis The design engineer may be concerned as to how a component behaves relative to dynamic input, which results in vibration. For vibration, most ﬁnite element packages start with a modal analysis of the component. This provides the natural frequencies and mode shapes that the component naturally vibrates at. These are called the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the component. Next, this solution can be transferred (much the same as for thermal stresses) to solvers for forced vibration analyses, such as frequency response, transient impact, or random vibration, to see how the component’s modes behave to dynamic input. The mode shape analysis is primarily based on stiffness and the resulting deﬂections. Thus, similar to static stress analysis, simpler models will suf- ﬁce. However, if, when solving forced response problems, stresses are desired, a more detailed model is necessary (similar to the shaft illustration given in Sec. 19–7). A modal analysis of the beam model without the bearing steps was performed for a 20-element beam model,15and the 56 384-element brick and tetrahedron model.Finite-Element Analysis 971 (a) (b) Figure 19–10 (a) Thin-walled aluminum beverage container loaded vertically downward on the top surface; ( b) isometric view of the buckled can (deﬂections greatly exaggerated). 15For static deﬂection analysis, only three beam elements were necessary. However, because of mass distribution for the dynamics problem, more beam elements are necessary.bud29281_ch19_952-976.qxd 12/22/2009 1:03 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:Needless to say, the beam model took less than 9 seconds to solve, whereas the solid model took considerably longer. The ﬁrst (fundamental) vibration mode was bending and is shown in Fig. 19–11 for both models, together with the respective frequencies. The difference between the frequencies is about 1.9 percent. Further note that the mode shape is just that, a shape. The actual magnitudes of the deﬂections are unknown, only their relative values are known. Thus, any scale factor can be used to exaggerate the view of the deﬂection shape. The convergence of the 20-element model was checked by doubling the number of elements. This resulted in no change. Figure 19–12 provides the frequencies and shapes for the second mode.16Here, the difference between the models is 3.6 percent. As stated earlier, once the mode shapes are obtained, the response of the structure to various dynamic loadings, such as harmonic, transient, or random input, can be obtained. This is accomplished by using the mode shapes together with modal super- position. The method is called modal analysis .17 19–11 Summary As stated in Sec. 1–4, the mechanical design engineer has many powerful computa- tional tools available today. Finite-element analysis is one of the most important and is easily integrated into the computer-aided engineering environment.

Since the beam and the bearing supports (boundary conditions) are axisymmetric, the bending modes are the same in all transverse planes. So, the second mode shown in Fig. 19–12 is the next unrepeated mode. 17See S. S.

Several types of analysis have been described in this chapter, using some fairly sim- ple illustrative problems. The purpose of this chapter, however, was to discuss some basic considerations of FEA element conﬁgurations, parameters, modeling consider- ations, and solvers, and not to necessarily describe complex geometric situations. Finite-element theory and applications is a vast subject, and will take years of expe- rience before one becomes knowledgeable and skilled with the technique. There are many sources of information on the topic in various textbooks; FEA software suppliers (such as ANSYS, MSC/NASTRAN, and Algor) provide case studies, user’s guides, user’s group newsletters, tutorials, etc.; and the Internet provides many sources.

Using the plane-stress two- dimensional element, utilizing symmetry, create a quarter model meshing elements in the radial and tangential directions. The elements for each cylinder should be assigned their unique mater- ial properties. The interface between the two cylinders should have common nodes. To simulate the press ﬁt, the inner cylinder will be forced to expand thermally. Assign a coefﬁcient of expan- sion and temperature increase, αand /Delta1T, respectively, for the inner cylinder. Do this according to the relation δ=α/Delta1Tb, where δand bare the radial interference and the outer radius of the inner member, respectively. Nodes along the straight edges of the quarter model should be ﬁxed in the tangential directions, and free to deﬂect in the radial direction.Finite-Element Analysis 975bud29281_ch19_952-976.qxd 12/22/2009 1:03 pm pinnacle s-171:Desktop Folder:Temp Work:Don't Delete (Jobs):MHDQ196/Budynas:This page intentionally left blank 20Statistical Considerations Chapter Outline 20–1 Random Variables 978 20–2 Arithmetic Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation 980 20–3 Probability Distributions 985 20–4 Propagation of Error 992 20–5 Linear Regression 994 977bud29281_ch20_0977-1002.qxd 12/22/09 2:55 PM epg 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:978 Mechanical Engineering Design Statistics in mechanical design provides a method of dealing with characteristics whose values are variable. Products manufactured in large quantities—automobiles, watches, lawnmowers, washing machines, for example—have a life that is variable. One auto- mobile may have so many defects that it must be repaired repeatedly during the ﬁrst few months of operation while another may operate satisfactorily for years, requiring only minor maintenance. Methods of quality control are deeply rooted in the use of statistics, and engineer- ing designers need a knowledge of statistics to conform to quality-control standards. The variability inherent in limits and ﬁts, in stress and strength, in bearing clearances, and in a multitude of other characteristics must be described numerically for proper control. It is not satisfactory to say that a product is expected to have a long and troublefree life. We must express such things as product life and product reliability in numerical form in order to achieve a speciﬁc quality goal. As noted in Sec. 1–10, uncer- tainties abound and require quantitative treatment. The algebra of real numbers, by itself, is not well-suited to describing the presence of variation. It is clear that consistencies in nature are stable, not in magnitude, but in the pat- tern of variation . Evidence gathered from nature by measurement is a mixture of sys- tematic and random effects. It is the role of statistics to separate these, and, through the sensitive use of data, illuminate the obscure. Some students will start this book after completing a formal course in statistics while others may have had brief encounters with statistics in their engineering courses. This contrast in background, together with space and time constraints, makes it very dif- ﬁcult to present an extensive integration of statistics with mechanical engineering design at this stage. Beyond ﬁrst courses in mechanical design and engineering statistics, the student can begin to meaningfully integrate the two in a second course in design. The intent of this chapter is to introduce some statistical concepts associated with basic reliability goals. 20–1 Random Variables Consider an experiment to measure strength in a collection of 20 tensile-test specimens that have been machined from a like number of samples selected at random from a car- load shipment of, say, UNS G10200 cold-drawn steel. It is reasonable to expect that there will be differences in the ultimate tensile strengths Sutof each of the individual test specimens. Such differences may occur because of differences in the sizes of the specimens, in the strength of the material itself, or both. Such an experiment is called a random experiment, because the specimens are selected at random. The strength Sut determined by this experiment is called a random, or a stochastic, variable. So a ran- dom variable is a variable quantity, such as strength, size, or weight, whose value depends on the outcome of a random experiment. Let us deﬁne a random variable x as the sum of the numbers obtained when two dice are tossed. Either die can display any number from 1 to 6. Figure 20–1 displays all possible outcomes in what is called the sample space. Note that x has a speciﬁc value Figure 20–1 Sample space showing all possible outcomes of the toss of two dice.1,1 1,2 1,3 1,4 1,5 1,6 2,1 2,2 2,3 2,4 2,5 2,6 3,1 3,2 3,3 3,4 3,5 3,6 4,1 4,2 4,3 4,4 4,5 4,6 5,1 5,2 5,3 5,4 5,5 5,6 6,1 6,2 6,3 6,4 6,5 6,6bud29281_ch20_0977-1002.qxd 12/22/09 2:55 PM epg 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Statistical Considerations 979 for each possible outcome—for example, the event 5, 4; x=5+4=9. It is useful to form a table showing the values of x and the corresponding values of the probability of x, called p=f(x). This is easily done from Fig. 20–1 merely by adding each outcome, determining how many times a speciﬁc value of xarises, and dividing by the total num- ber of possible outcomes. The results are shown in Table 20–1. Any table like this, list- ing all possible values of a random variable and with the corresponding probabilities, is called a probability distribution . The values of Table 20–1 are plotted in graphical form in Fig. 20–2. Here it is clear that the probability is a function of x. This probability function p=f(x)is often called the frequency function or, sometimes, the probability density function (PDF). The prob- ability that x is less than or equal to a certain value xican be obtained from the proba- bility function by summing the probability of all x’s up to and including xi. If we do this with Table 20–1, letting xiequal 2, then 3, and so on, up to 12, we get Table 20–2, which is called a cumulative probability distribution . The function F(x)in Table 20–2 is called a cumulative density function (CDF) of x. In terms of f(x)it may be expressed mathematically in the general form F(xi)=/summationdisplay xj≤xif(xj) (20–1) The cumulative distribution may also be plotted as a graph (Fig. 20–3). The variable x of this example is called a discrete random variable, because x has only discrete values. A continuous random variable is one that can take on any value in a speciﬁed interval; for such variables, graphs like Figs. 20–2 and 20–3 would be plotted as continuous curves. For a continuous probability density function F(x), the probability of obtaining an observation equal to or less than xis given by F(x)=/integraldisplayx −∞f(x)dx (20–2)Table 20–1 A Probability Distributionx 23456789 1 0 1 1 1 2 f(x)1 362 363 364 365 366 365 364 363 362 361 36 p = f(x) x6 36 5 36 4 36 3 36 2 36 1 36 0 0123456789 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3Figure 20–2 Frequency distribution.

(20–2) gives dF(x) dx=f(x) (20–4) 20–2 Arithmetic Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation In studying the variations in the mechanical properties and characteristics of mechani- cal elements, we shall generally be dealing with a ﬁnite number of elements. The total number of elements, called the population, may in some cases be quite large. In such cases it is usually impractical to measure the characteristics of each member of the pop- ulation, because this involves destructive testing in some cases, and so we select a small part of the group, called a sample, for these determinations. Thus the population is the entire group, and the sample is a part of the population. The arithmetic mean of a sample, called the sample mean, consisting of N elements, is deﬁned by the equation ¯x=x1+x2+x3+···+ xN N=1 NN/summationdisplay i=1xi (20–5) Besides the arithmetic mean, it is useful to have another kind of measure that will tell us something about the spread, or dispersion, of the distribution. For any random variable x, the deviation of the ith observation from the mean is xi−¯x.But since the sum of the deviations so deﬁned is always zero, we square them, and deﬁne sample variance as s2 x=(x1−¯x)2+(x2−¯x)2+···+ (xN−¯x)2 N−1=1 N−1N/summationdisplay i=1(xi−¯x)2(20–6)F(x) x36 36 27 36 18 36 9 36 0 0123456789 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3Figure 20–3 Cumulative frequency distribution.bud29281_ch20_0977-1002.qxd 12/22/09 2:55 PM epg 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Statistical Considerations 981 The sample standard deviation, deﬁned as the square root of the sample variance, is sx=/radicaltp/radicalvertex/radicalvertex/radicalbt1 N−1N/summationdisplay i=1(xi−¯x)2(20–7) Equation (20–7) is not well-suited for use in a calculator.

It should be observed that some authors deﬁne the variance and the standard devi- ation by using N instead of N−1in the denominator. For large values of N, there is very little difference. For small values, the denominator N−1actually gives a better estimate of the variance of the population from which the sample is taken. Equations (20–5) to (20–8) apply speciﬁcally to the sample of a population. When an entire population is considered, the same equations apply, but ¯xand sxare replaced with the symbols μxand, ˆσxrespectively. The circumﬂex accent mark ˆ, or “hat,” is used to avoid confusion with normal stress. For the population variance and standard deviation, N weighting is used in the denominators instead of N−1. Sometimes we are going to be dealing with the standard deviation of the strength of an element. So you must be careful not to be confused by the notation. Note that we are using the capital letter S for strength and the lowercase letter s for standard devia- tionas shown in the caption of the histogram in Fig. 20–4. Figure 20–4 is called a discrete frequency histogram, which gives the number of occurrences, or class frequency fi, within a given range.

The same convention is widely used for random variables that can be characterized by specifying a mean and a standard deviation. We shall there- fore use boldface characters to designate random variables as well as vectors. No confusion between the two is likely to arise. The terms stochastic variable and variate are also used to mean a random variable. A deterministic quantity is something that has a single speciﬁc value. The mean value of a population is a deterministic quantity, and so is its standard deviation. A stochastic variable can be partially described by the mean and the standard deviation, or by the mean and the coefﬁcient of variation deﬁned by Cx=sx ¯x(20–12) Thus the variate xfor the sample can be expressed in the following two ways: x=X(¯x,sx)=¯xX(1,Cx) (20–13) where Xrepresents a variate probability distribution function. Note that the determin- istic quantities ¯x,sx, and Cxare all in normal italic font.75 80 85 Tensile strength Su, kpsi (a)90 95050100Number of tests, N 40 45 50 Yield strength Sy, kpsi (b)55 60050100150Number of tests, NFigure 20–4 Distribution of tensile properties of hot-rolled UNS G10350 steel, as rolled.

The descriptive statistics developed, whether from ungrouped or grouped data, describe the ultimate tensile strength Sutof the material from which we will form parts. Such description is not possible with a single number. In fact, sometimes two or three numbers plus identiﬁcation or, at least, a robust approximation of the distribution are needed. As you look at the data in Ex. 20–1, consider the answers to these questions: •Can we characterize the ultimate tensile strength by the mean, ¯Sut? •Can we take the lowest ultimate tensile strength of 62.8 kpsi as a minimum? If we do, we will encounter some lesser ultimate strengths, because some of 100 specimens will be lower. •Can we ﬁnd the distribution of the ultimate tensile strength of the 1030 stock in Ex. 20–1? Yes, but it will take more specimens and require plotting on coordinates that rectify the data string.bud29281_ch20_0977-1002.qxd 12/22/09 2:55 PM epg 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Statistical Considerations 985 20–3 Probability Distributions There are a number of standard discrete and continuous probability distributions that are commonly applicable to engineering problems. In this section, we will discuss four important continuous probability distributions; the Gaussian, or normal, distribution; the lognormal distribution; the uniform distribution; and the Weibull distribution . The Gaussian (Normal) Distribution When Gauss asked the question, What distribution is the most likely parent to a set of data?, the answer was the distribution that bears his name. The Gaussian, or normal, distribution is an important one whose probability density function is expressed in terms of its mean μxand its standard deviation ˆσxas f(x)=1 ˆσx√ 2πexp/bracketleftBigg −1 2/parenleftbiggx−μx ˆσx/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg (20–14) With the notation described in Sec. 20–2, the normally distributed variate xcan be expressed as x=N(μx,ˆσx)=μxN(1,Cx) (20–15) where Nrepresents the normal distribution function given by Eq. (20–14). Since Eq. (20–14) is a probability density function, the area under it, as required, is unity. Plots of Eq. (20–14) are shown in Fig. 20–5 for small and large standard devi- ations. The bell-shaped curve is taller and narrower for small values of ˆσand shorter and broader for large values of ˆσ. Integration of Eq. (20–14) to ﬁnd the cumulative den- sity function F(x)is not possible in closed form, but must be accomplished numeri- cally. To avoid the need for many tables for different values of μand ˆσ, the deviation from the mean is expressed in units of standard deviation by the transform z=x−μx ˆσx(20–16) The integral of the transform is tabulated in Table A–10 and sketched in Fig. 20–6. The value of the normal cumulative density function is used so often, and manipulated in so f(x) x/H9262 (a)f(x) x/H9262 (b)Figure 20–5 The shape of the normal distribution curve: ( a) small ˆσ; (b) large ˆσ. f(z) zz/H9251/H9021(z/H9251) 0/H9251Figure 20–6 The standard normal distribution.bud29281_ch20_0977-1002.qxd 12/22/09 2:55 PM epg 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:986 Mechanical Engineering Design many equations, that it has its own particular symbol, /Phi1(z).

EXAMPLE 20–3 In a shipment of 250 connecting rods, the mean tensile strength is found to be 45 kpsi and the standard deviation 5 kpsi. (a) Assuming a normal distribution, how many rods can be expected to have a strength less than 39.5 kpsi? (b) How many are expected to have a strength between 39.5 and 59.5 kpsi? Solution (a) Substituting in Eq. (20–16) gives the standardized zvariable as z39.5=x−μx ˆσx=S−¯S ˆσS=39.5−45 5=−1.10 The probability that the strength is less than 39.5 kpsi can be designated as F(z)= /Phi1(−1.10). Using Table A–10, and referring to Fig. 20–7, we ﬁnd /Phi1(z39.5)=0.1357 . So the number of rods having a strength less than 39.5 kpsi is, f(z) z z59.5 z39.50 +2.9 –1.1 –Figure 20–7 Answer N/Phi1(z39.5)=250(0.1357)=33.9≈34 because /Phi1(z39.5)represents the proportion of the population N having a strength less than 39.5 kpsi. (b) Corresponding to S=59.5kpsi, we have z59.5=59.5−45 5=2.90 Referring again to Fig. 20–7, we see that the probability that the strength is less than 59.5 kpsi is F(z)=/Phi1(z59.5). Since the zvariable is positive, we need to ﬁnd the value complementary to unity. Thus, from Table A–10, /Phi1(2.90)=1−/Phi1(−2.90)=1−0.001 87 =0.998 13 The probability that the strength lies between 39.5 and 59.5 kpsi is the area between the ordinates at z39.5and z59.5in Fig. 20–7. This probability is found to be p=/Phi1(z59.5)−/Phi1(z39.5)=/Phi1(2.90)−/Phi1(−1.10) =0.998 13 −0.1357=0.862 43 Therefore the number of rods expected to have strengths between 39.5 and 59.5 kpsi is Answer Np=250(0.862)=215.5≈216bud29281_ch20_0977-1002.qxd 12/22/09 2:55 PM epg 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Statistical Considerations 987 The Lognormal Distribution Sometimes random variables have the following two characteristics: •The distribution is asymmetrical about the mean. •The variables have only positive values. Such characteristics rule out the use of the normal distribution. There are several other distributions that are potentially useful in such situations, one of them being the log- normal (written as a single word) distribution. Especially when life is involved, such as fatigue life under stress or the wear life of rolling bearings, the lognormal distribution may be a very appropriate one to use. The lognormal distribution is one in which the logarithms of the variate have a nor- mal distribution. Thus the variate itself is said to be lognormally distributed. Let this variate be expressed as x=LN(μx,ˆσx) (a) Equation ( a) states that the random variable xis distributed lognormally ( not a loga- rithm ) and that its mean value is μxand its standard deviation is ˆσx. Now use the transformation y=lnx (b) Since, by deﬁnition, yhas a normal distribution, we can write y=N(μy,ˆσy) (c) This equation states that the random variable yis normally distributed, its mean value is μy, and its standard deviation is ˆσy. It is convenient to think of Eq. ( a) as designating the parent, or principal, distribu- tion while Eq. ( b) represents the companion, or subsidiary, distribution. The probability density function (PDF) for xcan be derived from that for y; see Eq. (20–14), and substitute y for x in that equation. Thus the PDF for the companion distribution is found to be f(x)=⎧ ⎨ ⎩1 xˆσy√ 2πexp/bracketleftBigg −1 2/parenleftbigglnx−μy ˆσy/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg forx>0 0 for x≤0(20–17) The companion mean μyand standard deviation ˆσyin Eq.

As seen in Fig. 20–8, both normal and lognormal densities ﬁt well. The Uniform Distribution The uniform distribution is a closed-interval distribution that arises when the chance of an observation is the same as the chance for any other observation. If ais the lower bound and bis the upper bound, then the probability density function (PDF) for the uni- form distribution is f(x)=/braceleftbigg1/(b−a) a≤x≤b 0 a>x>b(20–20)bud29281_ch20_0977-1002.qxd 12/22/09 2:55 PM epg 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:990 Mechanical Engineering Design The cumulative density function (CDF), the integral of f(x),is thus linear in the range a≤x≤bgiven by F(x)=/braceleftBigg0 x<a (x−a)/(b−a) a≤x≤b 1 x>b(20–21) The mean and standard deviation are given by μx=a+b 2(20–22) ˆσx=b−a 2√ 3(20–23) The uniform distribution arises, among other places in manufacturing, where a part is mass-produced in an automatic operation and the dimension gradually changes through tool wear and increased tool forces between setups. If nis the part sequence or processing number, and nfis the sequence number of the ﬁnal-produced part before another setup, then the dimension xgraphs linearly when plotted against the sequence number n. If the last proof part made during the setup has a dimension xi, and the ﬁnal part produced has the dimension xf, the magnitude of the dimension at sequence num- ber nis given by x=xi+(xf−xi)n nf=xi+(xf−xi)F(x) (a) since n/nfis a good approximation to the CDF. Solving Eq. ( a) for F(x)gives F(x)=x−xi xf−xi(b) Compare this equation with the middle form of Eq. (20–21). The Weibull Distribution The Weibull distribution does not arise from classical statistics and is usually not included in elementary statistics textbooks. It is far more likely to be discussed and used in works dealing with experimental results, particularly reliability. It is a chameleon dis- tribution, asymmetrical, with different values for the mean and the median. It contains within it a good approximation of the normal distribution as well as an exact represen- tation of the exponential distribution. Most reliability information comes from labora- tory and ﬁeld service data, and because of its ﬂexibility, the Weibull distribution is widely used. The expression for reliability is the value of the cumulative density function com- plementary to unity. For the Weibull this value is both explicit and simple. The reliability given by the three-parameter Weibull distribution is R(x)=exp/bracketleftBigg −/parenleftbiggx−x0 θ−x0/parenrightbiggb/bracketrightBigg x≥x0≥0 (20–24) where the three parameters are x0=minimum, guaranteed, value of x θ=a characteristic or scale value (θ≥x0) b=a shape parameter ( b>0)bud29281_ch20_0977-1002.qxd 12/22/09 2:55 PM epg 203:MHDQ196:bud29281:0073529281:bud29281_pagefiles:Statistical Considerations 991 xx0b = 1.5Frequency f(x) b = 8b < 1Figure 20–9 The density function of the Weibull distribution showing the effect of skewness of the shape parameter b. 1To estimate the Weibull parameters from data, see J.

The shape parameter b controls the skewness of the distribution. Figure 20–9 shows that large b’s skew the distribution to the right and small b’s skew it to the left. In the range 3.3<b<3.5, approximate symmetry is obtained along with a good approximation to the normal distribution. When b=1, the distribution is exponential.

Here, the variate xis put in dimensionless form as x=L/L10where Lis bearing life, in say, number of cycles; and L10is the manufacturer’s rated life of the bearing where 10 percent of the bearings have failed (90 percent reliability).

Then Eq. ( a) is written as /H9268=F A(b) and we see that the stress /H9268is also a random variable. When Eq. ( b) is solved, the errors inherent in Fand in Aare said to be propagated to the stress variate /H9268. It is not hard to think of many other relations where this will occur.

The results shown can easily be combined to form other functions. An unanswered question here is what is the distribution that results from the vari- ous operations?

The process is called linear regression when the best-ﬁtting straight line is to be found. The meaning of the word best is open to argument, because there can be many meanings. The usual method, and the one employed here, regards a line as “best” if it minimizes the squares of the deviations of the data points from the line. Figure 20–10 shows a set of data points approximated by the line AB.

Consider a set of Ndata points (xi,yi). In general, the best-ﬁt line will not intersect a data point. Thus, we can write yi=mxi+b+/epsilon1i (b) where /epsilon1i=yi−yis the deviation between the data point and the line. The sum of the squares of the deviations is given by3 E=/summationdisplay /epsilon12 i=/summationdisplay (yi−mxi−b)2(c) Minimizing E, the sum of the squared errors, expecting a stationary point minimum, requires ∂E/∂m=0and ∂E/∂b=0. This results in two simultaneous equations for the slope and yintercept denoted as ˆmand ˆb, respectively. Solving these equations results in ˆm=N/summationtextxiyi−/summationtextxi/summationtextyi N/summationtextx2 i−/parenleftbig/summationtextxi/parenrightbig2=/summationtextxiyi−N¯x¯y/summationtextx2 i−N¯x2(20–32) ˆb=/summationtextyi−ˆm/summationtextxi N=¯y−ˆm¯x (20–33) Once you have established a slope and an intercept, the next point of interest is to discover how well x and y correlate with each other. If the data points are scattered all over the xy plane, there is obviously no correlation. But if all the data points coincide with the regression line, then there is perfect correlation. Most statistical data will be in between these extremes. A correlation coefﬁcient r , having the range −1≤r≤+1, has been devised to answer this question. The formula is r=ˆmsx sy(20–34) where sxand syare the standard deviations of the xcoordinates and ycoordinates of the data, respectively. If r=0, there is no correlation; if r=±1, there is perfect correla- tion. A positive or negative r indicates that the regression line has a positive or negative slope, respectively.

What are the mean, the standard deviation, and the coefﬁcient of variation of the corresponding strain /H9280. 20–13 In Hooke’s law for uniaxial stress, /H9268/H11005 /H9280E, the strain is given as /H9280∼(0.0005, 0 .000 034) and Young’s modulus as E∼(29.5,0.885)Mpsi.
