We hope you beneﬁt from the time and effort it has taken putting it together and that you think it was a worthwhile undertaking. It all started as a discussion at aconference in Portugal when we realized that we were putting together bookswith similar aims and objectives. Since we are friends as well as colleagues, itseemed sensible that we join forces rather than compete; sharing the load andplaying to each other’s strengths undoubtedly means a better all-round effort andresult. We wrote this book because we have all been working in the ﬁeld of AM for many years. Although none of us like to be called “old,” we do seem to have 60 years of experience, collectively, and have each established reputations as educators and researchers in this ﬁeld. We have each seen the technologiesdescribed in this book take shape and develop into serious commercial tools, withtens of thousands of users and many millions of parts being made by AM machineseach year. AM is now being incorporated into curricula in many schools,polytechnics, and universities around the world. More and more students arebecoming aware of these technologies and yet, as we saw it, there was no singletext adequate for such curricula. We believe that the ﬁrst edition of this book provided such a text, and based upon the updated information in this 2nd edition, we hope we’ve improved upon that start. Additive Manufacturing is deﬁned by a range of technologies that are capable of translating virtual solid model data into physical models in a quick and easyprocess. The data are broken down into a series of 2D cross-sections of a ﬁnitethickness. These cross-sections are fed into AM machines so that they can becombined, adding them together in a layer-by-layer sequence to form the physicalpart. The geometry of the part is therefore clearly reproduced in the AM machinewithout having to adjust for manufacturing processes, like attention to tooling, undercuts, draft angles, or other features. We can say therefore that the AM machine is a What You See Is What You Build (WYSIWYB) process that isparticularly valuable the more complex the geometry is. This basic principle drivesnearly all AM machines, with variations in each technology in terms of thetechniques used for creating layers and in bonding them together. Further variations vinclude speed, layer thickness, range of materials, accuracy, and of course cost. With so many variables, it is clear to see why this book must be so long anddetailed. Having said that, we still feel there is much more we could have written about. The ﬁrst three chapters of this book provide a basic overview of AM processes. Without fully describing each technology, we provide an appreciation for why AMis so important to many branches of industry. We outline the rapid development ofthis technology from humble beginnings that showed promise but still requiringmuch development, to one that is now maturing and showing real beneﬁt to productdevelopment organizations. In reading these chapters, we hope you can learn thebasics of how AM works. The next nine chapters (Chaps. 4–12) take each group of technologies in turn and describe them in detail. The fundamentals of each technology are dealt with interms of the basic process, whether it involves photopolymer curing, sintering,melting, etc., so that the reader can appreciate what is needed in order to under-stand, develop, and optimize each technology. Most technologies discussed in thisbook have been commercialized by at least one company; and these machines aredescribed along with discussion on how to get the best out of them. The last chapterin this group focused on inexpensive processes and machines, which overlaps some of the material in earlier chapters, but we felt that the exponentially increasing interest in these low-cost machines justiﬁed the special treatment. The ﬁnal chapters deal with how to apply AM technology in different settings. Firstly, we look at selection methods for sorting through the many optionsconcerning the type of machine you should buy in relation to your applicationand provide guidelines on how to select the right technology for your purpose.Since all AM machines depend on input from 3D CAD software, we go on todiscuss how this process takes place. We follow this with a discussion of post- processing methods and technologies so that if your selected machine and material cannot produce exactly what you want, you have the means for improving the part’sproperties and appearance. A chapter on software issues in AM completes thisgroup of chapters. AM technologies have improved to the extent that many manufacturers are using AM machine output for end-product use. Called Direct Digital Manufacturing, thisopens the door to many exciting and novel applications considered impossible,infeasible, or uneconomic in the past. We can now consider the possibility of mass customization, where a product can be produced according to the tastes of an individual consumer but at a cost-effective price. Then, we look at how the use ofthis technology has affected the design process considering how we might improveour designs because of the WYSIWYB approach. This moves us on nicely to thesubjects of applications of AM, including tooling and products in the medical,aerospace, and automotive industries. We complete the book with a chapter on thebusiness, or enterprise-level, aspects of AM, investigating how these systemsvi Prefaceenable creative businesses and entrepreneurs to invent new products, and where AM will likely develop in the future. This book is primarily aimed at students and educators studying Additive Manufacturing, either as a self-contained course or as a module within a larger course on manufacturing technology. There is sufﬁcient depth for an undergraduateor graduate-level course, with many references to point the student further along thepath. Each chapter also has a number of exercise questions designed to test thereader’s knowledge and to expand their thinking. A companion instructor’s guide isbeing developed as part of the 2nd edition to include additional exercises and theirsolutions, to aid educators. Researchers into AM may also ﬁnd this text useful inhelping them understand the state of the art and the opportunities for further research. We have made a wide range of changes in moving from the ﬁrst edition, completed in 2009, to this new edition. As well as bringing everything as up todate as is possible in this rapidly changing ﬁeld, we have added in a number of newsections and chapters. The chapter on medical applications has been extended toinclude discussion on automotive and aerospace. There is a new chapter on rapidtooling as well as one that discusses the recent movements in the low-cost AMsector. We have inserted a range of recent technological innovations, including discussion on the new Additive Manufacturing File Format as well as other inclusions surrounding the standardization of AM with ASTM and ISO. We havealso updated the terminology in the text to conform to terminology developed bythe ASTM F42 committee, which has also been adopted as an ISO internationalstandard. In this 2nd edition we have edited the text to, as much as possible, removereferences to company-speciﬁc technologies and instead focus more on technolog-ical principles and general understanding. We split the original chapter on printingprocesses into two chapters on material jetting and on binder jetting to reﬂect the standard terminology and the evolution of these processes in different directions. As a result of these many additions and changes, we feel that this edition is nowsigniﬁcantly more comprehensive than the ﬁrst one. Although we have worked hard to make this book as comprehensive as possible, we recognize that a book about such rapidly changing technology will not be up-to-date for very long. With this in mind, and to help educators and students betterutilize this book, we will update our course website at http://www.springer.com/ 978-1-4419-1119-3 , with additional homework exercises and other aids for educators. If you have comments, questions, or suggestions for improvement, they are welcome. We anticipate updating this book in the future, and we lookforward to hearing how you have used these materials and how we might improvethis book.Preface viiAs mentioned earlier, each author is an established expert in Additive Manufacturing with many years of research experience. In addition, in manyways, this book is only possible due to the many students and colleagues with whom we have collaborated over the years.

prototyping. The term rapid prototyping (RP) is used in a variety of industriesto describe a process for rapidly creating a system or part representation beforeﬁnal release or commercialization. In other words, the emphasis is on creatingsomething quickly and that the output is a prototype or basis model from which further models and eventually the ﬁnal product will be derived. Management consultants and software engineers both use the term rapid prototyping todescribe a process of developing business and software solutions in a piecewisefashion that allows clients and other stakeholders to test ideas and providefeedback during the development process. In a product development context,the term rapid prototyping was used widely to describe technologies whichcreated physical prototypes directly from digital data. This text is about theselatter technologies, ﬁrst developed for prototyping, but now used for many more purposes. 1.1 What Is Additive Manufacturing? Additive manufacturing is the formalized term for what used to be called rapidprototyping and what is popularly called 3D Printing. The term rapid prototyping (RP) is used in a variety of industries to describe a process for rapidly creating asystem or part representation before ﬁnal release or commercialization. In otherwords, the emphasis is on creating something quickly and that the output is aprototype or basis model from which further models and eventually the ﬁnalproduct will be derived. Management consultants and software engineers bothalso use the term rapid prototyping to describe a process of developing businessand software solutions in a piecewise fashion that allows clients and other stakeholders to test ideas and provide feedback during the development process. In a product development context, the term rapid prototyping was used widely to #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_11describe technologies which created physical prototypes directly from digital model data. This text is about these latter technologies, ﬁrst developed forprototyping, but now used for many more purposes. Users of RP technology have come to realize that this term is inadequate and in particular does not effectively describe more recent applications of the technology.Improvements in the quality of the output from these machines have meant thatthere is often a much closer link to the ﬁnal product. Many parts are in fact nowdirectly manufactured in these machines, so it is not possible for us to label them as“prototypes.” The term rapid prototyping also overlooks the basic principle of thesetechnologies in that they all fabricate parts using an additive approach. A recentlyformed Technical Committee within ASTM International agreed that new termi- nology should be adopted. While this is still under debate, recently adopted ASTM consensus standards now use the term additive manufacturing [ 1]. Referred to in short as AM, the basic principle of this technology is that a model, initially generated using a three-dimensional Computer-Aided Design (3D CAD)system, can be fabricated directly without the need for process planning. Althoughthis is not in reality as simple as it ﬁrst sounds, AM technology certainly signiﬁ-cantly simpliﬁes the process of producing complex 3D objects directly from CADdata. Other manufacturing processes require a careful and detailed analysis of the part geometry to determine things like the order in which different features can be fabricated, what tools and processes must be used, and what additional ﬁxtures maybe required to complete the part. In contrast, AM needs only some basic dimen-sional details and a small amount of understanding as to how the AM machineworks and the materials that are used to build the part. The key to how AM works is that parts are made by adding material in layers; each layer is a thin cross-section of the part derived from the original CAD data.Obviously in the physical world, each layer must have a ﬁnite thickness to it and so the resulting part will be an approximation of the original data, as illustrated by Fig.1.1. The thinner each layer is, the closer the ﬁnal part will be to the original. All commercialized AM machines to date use a layer-based approach, and the majorways that they differ are in the materials that can be used, how the layers arecreated, and how the layers are bonded to each other. Such differences willdetermine factors like the accuracy of the ﬁnal part plus its material propertiesand mechanical properties. They will also determine factors like how quickly thepart can be made, how much post-processing is required, the size of the AM machine used, and the overall cost of the machine and process. This chapter will introduce the basic concepts of additive manufacturing and describe a generic AM process from design to application. It will go on to discussthe implications of AM on design and manufacturing and attempt to help inunderstanding how it has changed the entire product development process. SinceAM is an increasingly important tool for product development, the chapter endswith a discussion of some related tools in the product development process.2 1 Introduction and Basic Principles1.2 What Are AM Parts Used for? Throughout this book you will ﬁnd a wide variety of applications for AM. You will also realize that the number of applications is increasing as the processes developand improve. Initially, AM was used speciﬁcally to create visualization models forproducts as they were being developed. It is widely known that models can be muchmore helpful than drawings or renderings in fully understanding the intent of thedesigner when presenting the conceptual design. While drawings are quicker and easier to create, models are nearly always required in the end to fully validate the design. Following this initial purpose of simple model making, AM technology has developed over time as materials, accuracy, and the overall quality of the outputimproved. Models were quickly employed to supply information about what isknown as the “3 Fs” of Form, Fit, and Function. The initial models were used tohelp fully appreciate the shape and general purpose of a design (Form). Improvedaccuracy in the process meant that components were capable of being built to the tolerances required for assembly purposes (Fit). Improved material properties meant that parts could be properly handled so that they could be assessed accordingto how they would eventually work (Function). Fig. 1.1 CAD image of a teacup with further images showing the effects of building using different layer thicknesses1.2 What Are AM Parts Used for? 3To say that AM technology is only useful for making models, though, would be inaccurate and undervaluing the technology. AM, when used in conjunction withother technologies to form process chains, can be used to signiﬁcantly shorten product development times and costs. More recently, some of these technologies have been developed to the extent that the output is suitable for end use. Thisexplains why the terminology has essentially evolved from rapid prototyping toadditive manufacturing. Furthermore, use of high-power laser technology hasmeant that parts can now also be directly made in a variety of metals, thus extendingthe application range even further. 1.3 The Generic AM Process AM involves a number of steps that move from the virtual CAD description to thephysical resultant part. Different products will involve AM in different ways and to different degrees. Small, relatively simple products may only make use of AM for visualization models, while larger, more complex products with greater engineeringcontent may involve AM during numerous stages and iterations throughout thedevelopment process. Furthermore, early stages of the product development pro-cess may only require rough parts, with AM being used because of the speed atwhich they can be fabricated. At later stages of the process, parts may requirecareful cleaning and post-processing (including sanding, surface preparation, andpainting) before they are used, with AM being useful here because of the complex- ity of form that can be created without having to consider tooling. Later on, we will investigate thoroughly the different stages of the AM process, but to summarize,most AM processes involve, to some degree at least, the following eight steps(as illustrated in Fig. 1.2). 1.3.1 Step 1: CAD All AM parts must start from a software model that fully describes the external geometry. This can involve the use of almost any professional CAD solid modelingsoftware, but the output must be a 3D solid or surface representation. Reverse engineering equipment (e.g., laser and optical scanning) can also be used to create this representation. 1.3.2 Step 2: Conversion to STL Nearly every AM machine accepts the STL ﬁle format, which has become a defacto standard, and nowadays nearly every CAD system can output such a ﬁleformat. This ﬁle describes the external closed surfaces of the original CAD modeland forms the basis for calculation of the slices.4 1 Introduction and Basic Principles1.3.3 Step 3: Transfer to AM Machine and STL File Manipulation The STL ﬁle describing the part must be transferred to the AM machine. Here, there may be some general manipulation of the ﬁle so that it is the correct size, position,and orientation for building. 1.3.4 Step 4: Machine Setup The AM machine must be properly set up prior to the build process. Such settingswould relate to the build parameters like the material constraints, energy source,layer thickness, timings, etc. 1.3.5 Step 5: Build Building the part is mainly an automated process and the machine can largely carryon without supervision. Only superﬁcial monitoring of the machine needs to takeplace at this time to ensure no errors have taken place like running out of material,power or software glitches, etc. Fig. 1.2 Generic process of CAD to part, showing all eight stages1.3 The Generic AM Process 51.3.6 Step 6: Removal Once the AM machine has completed the build, the parts must be removed. This may require interaction with the machine, which may have safety interlocks to ensure for example that the operating temperatures are sufﬁciently low or that there are no actively moving parts. 1.3.7 Step 7: Post-processing Once removed from the machine, parts may require an amount of additionalcleaning up before they are ready for use. Parts may be weak at this stage or theymay have supporting features that must be removed. This therefore often requires time and careful, experienced manual manipulation. 1.3.8 Step 8: Application Parts may now be ready to be used. However, they may also require additional treatment before they are acceptable for use. For example, they may requirepriming and painting to give an acceptable surface texture and ﬁnish. Treatments may be laborious and lengthy if the ﬁnishing requirements are very demanding. They may also be required to be assembled together with other mechanical orelectronic components to form a ﬁnal model or product. While the numerous stages in the AM process have now been discussed, it is important to realize that many AM machines require careful maintenance. ManyAM machines use fragile laser or printer technology that must be carefully moni-tored and that should preferably not be used in a dirty or noisy environment. Whilemachines are generally designed to operate unattended, it is important to include regular checks in the maintenance schedule, and that different technologies require different levels of maintenance. It is also important to note that AM processes falloutside of most materials and process standards; explaining the recent interest in theASTM F42 Technical Committee on Additive Manufacturing Technologies, whichis working to address and overcome this problem [ 1]. However, many machine vendors recommend and provide test patterns that can be used periodically toconﬁrm that the machines are operating within acceptable limits. In addition to the machinery, materials may also require careful handling. The raw materials used in some AM processes have limited shelf-life and may also be required to be kept in conditions that prevent them from unwanted chemicalreactions. Exposure to moisture, excess light, and other contaminants should alsobe avoided. Most processes use materials that can be reused for more than onebuild. However, it may be that reuse could degrade the properties if performedmany times over, and therefore a procedure for maintaining consistent materialquality through recycling should also be observed.6 1 Introduction and Basic Principles1.4 Why Use the Term Additive Manufacturing? By now, you should realize that the technology we are referring to is primarily the use of additive processes, combining materials layer by layer. The term additivemanufacturing, or AM, seems to describe this quite well, but there are many other terms which are in use. This section discusses other terms that have been used to describe this technology as a way of explaining the overall purpose and beneﬁts ofthe technology for product development. 1.4.1 Automated Fabrication (Autofab) This term was popularized by Marshall Burns in his book of the same name, which was one of the ﬁrst texts to cover this technology in the early 1990s [ 2]. The emphasis here is on the use of automation to manufacture products, thus implyingthe simpliﬁcation or removal of manual tasks from the process. Computers andmicrocontrollers are used to control the actuators and to monitor the systemvariables. This term can also be used to describe other forms of Computer Numeri-cal Controlled (CNC) machining centers since there is no direct reference as to howparts are built or the number of stages it would take to build them, although Burnsdoes primarily focus on the technologies also covered by this book. Some key technologies are however omitted since they arose after the book was written. 1.4.2 Freeform Fabrication or Solid Freeform Fabrication The emphasis here is in the capability of the processes to fabricate complex geometric shapes. Sometimes the advantage of these technologies is described interms of providing “complexity for free,” implying that it doesn’t particularlymatter what the shape of the input object actually is. A simple cube or cylinder would take almost as much time and effort to fabricate within the machine as a complex anatomical structure with the same enclosing volume. The reference to“Freeform” relates to the independence of form from the manufacturing process.This is very different from most conventional manufacturing processes that becomemuch more involved as the geometric complexity increases. 1.4.3 Additive Manufacturing or Layer-Based Manufacturing These descriptions relate to the way the processes fabricate parts by adding materialin layers. This is in contrast to machining technology that removes, or subtractsmaterial from a block of raw material. It should be noted that some of the processesare not purely additive, in that they may add material at one point but also usesubtractive processes at some stage as well. Currently, every commercial processworks in a layer-wise fashion. However, there is nothing to suggest that this is an1.4 Why Use the Term Additive Manufacturing? 7essential approach to use and that future systems may add material in other ways and yet still come under a broad classiﬁcation that is appropriate to this text. Aslight variation on this, Additive Fabrication, is a term that was popularized by Terry Wohlers, a well-known industry consultant in this ﬁeld and who compiles a widely regarded annual industry report on the state of this industry [ 3]. However, many professionals prefer the term “manufacturing” to “fabrication” since “fabri-cation” has some negative connotations that infer the part may still be a “prototype”rather than a ﬁnished article. Additionally, in some regions of the world the termfabrication is associated with sheet metal bending and related processes, and thusprofessionals from these regions often object to the use of the word fabrication forthis industry. Additive manufacturing is, therefore, starting to become widely used, and has also been adopted by Wohlers in his most recent publications and presentations. 1.4.4 Stereolithography or 3D Printing These two terms were initially used to describe speciﬁc machines.Stereolithography (SL) was termed by the US company 3D Systems [ 4,5] and 3D Printing (3DP) was widely used by researchers at MIT [ 6] who invented an ink-jet printing-based technology. Both terms allude to the use of 2D processes (lithography and printing) and extending them into the third dimension. Since most people are very familiar with printing technology, the idea of printing a physicalthree-dimensional object should make sense. Many consider that eventually theterm 3D Printing will become the most commonly used wording to describe AMtechnologies. Recent media interest in the technology has proven this to be true andthe general public is much more likely to know the term 3D Printing than any otherterm mentioned in this book. 1.4.5 Rapid Prototyping Rapid prototyping was termed because of the process this technology was designedto enhance or replace. Manufacturers and product developers used to ﬁndprototyping a complex, tedious, and expensive process that often impeded thedevelopmental and creative phases during the introduction of a new product. RPwas found to signiﬁcantly speed up this process and thus the term was adopted.However, users and developers of this technology now realize that AM technologycan be used for much more than just prototyping. Signiﬁcant improvements in accuracy and material properties have seen this technology catapulted into testing, tooling, manufacturing, and other realms that areoutside the “prototyping” deﬁnition. However, it can also be seen that most of theother terms described above are also ﬂawed in some way. One possibility is thatmany will continue to use the term RP without speciﬁcally restricting it to themanufacture of prototypes, much in the way that IBM makes things other than8 1 Introduction and Basic Principlesbusiness machines and that 3M manufactures products outside of the mining industry. It will be interesting to watch how terminology develops in the future. Where possible, we have used additive manufacturing or its abbreviation AM throughout this book as the generic term for the suite of technologies covered by this book. It should be noted that, in the literature, most of the terms introducedabove are interchangeable; but different terminology may emphasize the approachused in a particular instance. Thus, both in this book and while searching for orreading other literature, the reader must consider the context to best understandwhat each of these terms means. 1.5 The Benefits of AM Many people have described this technology as revolutionizing product develop-ment and manufacturing. Some have even gone on to say that manufacturing, as we know it today, may not exist if we follow AM to its ultimate conclusion and that we are experiencing a new industrial revolution. AM is now frequently referred to asone of a series of disruptive technologies that are changing the way we designproducts and set up new businesses. We might, therefore, like to ask “why is this thecase?” What is it about AM that enthuses and inspires some to make these kinds ofstatements? First, let’s consider the “rapid” character of this technology. The speed advan- tage is not just in terms of the time it takes to build parts. The speeding up of the whole product development process relies much on the fact that we are using computers throughout. Since 3D CAD is being used as the starting point and thetransfer to AM is relatively seamless, there is much less concern over data conver-sion or interpretation of the design intent. Just as 3D CAD is becoming What YouSee Is What You Get (WYSIWYG), so it is the same with AM and we might just aseasily say that What You See Is What You Build (WYSIWYB). The seamlessness can also be seen in terms of the reduction in process steps. Regardless of the complexity of parts to be built, building within an AM machine is generally performed in a single step. Most other manufacturing processes would require multiple and iterative stages to be carried out. As you include more featuresin a design, the number of these stages may increase dramatically. Even a relativelysimple change in the design may result in a signiﬁcant increase in the time requiredto build using conventional methods. AM can, therefore, be seen as a way to moreeffectively predict the amount of time to fabricate models, regardless of whatchanges may be implemented during this formative stage of the productdevelopment. Similarly, the number of processes and resources required can be signiﬁcantly reduced when using AM. If a skilled craftsman was requested to build a prototypeaccording to a set of CAD drawings, he may ﬁnd that he must manufacture the partin a number of stages. This may be because he must employ a variety of construc-tion methods, ranging from hand carving, through molding and forming techniques,to CNC machining. Hand carving and similar operations are tedious, difﬁcult, and1.5 The Benefits of AM 9prone to error. Molding technology can be messy and obviously requires the building of one or more molds. CNC machining requires careful planning and asequential approach that may also require construction of ﬁxtures before the part itself can be made. All this of course presupposes that these technologies are within the repertoire of the craftsman and readily available. AM can be used to remove or at least simplify many of these multistage processes. With the addition of some supporting technologies like silicone-rubbermolding, drills, polishers, grinders, etc. it can be possible to manufacture a vastrange of different parts with different characteristics. Workshops which adopt AMtechnology can be much cleaner, more streamlined, and more versatile than before. 1.6 Distinction Between AM and CNC Machining As mentioned in the discussion on Automated Fabrication, AM shares some of itsDNA with CNC machining technology. CNC is also a computer-based technologythat is used to manufacture products. CNC differs mainly in that it is primarily asubtractive rather than additive process, requiring a block of material that must be atleast as big as the part that is to be made. This section discusses a range of topicswhere comparisons between CNC machining and AM can be made. The purpose isnot really to inﬂuence choice of one technology over another rather than to establish how they may be implemented for different stages in the product development process, or for different types of product. 1.6.1 Material AM technology was originally developed around polymeric materials, waxes, andpaper laminates. Subsequently, there has been introduction of composites, metals,and ceramics. CNC machining can be used for soft materials, like medium-density ﬁberboard (MDF), machinable foams, machinable waxes, and even some polymers. However, use of CNC to shape softer materials is focused on preparing these partsfor use in a multistage process like casting. When using CNC machining to makeﬁnal products, it works particularly well for hard, relatively brittle materials likesteels and other metal alloys to produce high accuracy parts with well-deﬁnedproperties. Some AM parts, in contrast, may have voids or anisotropy that are afunction of part orientation, process parameters or how the design was input to themachine, whereas CNC parts will normally be more homogeneous and predictable in quality. 1.6.2 Speed High-speed CNC machining can generally remove material much faster than AM machines can add a similar volume of material. However, this is only part of the10 1 Introduction and Basic Principlespicture, as AM technology can be used to produce a part in a single stage. CNC machines require considerable setup and process planning, particularly as partsbecome more complex in their geometry. Speed must therefore be considered in terms of the whole process rather than just the physical interaction of the part material. CNC is likely to be a multistage manufacturing process, requiringrepositioning or relocation of parts within one machine or use of more than onemachine. To make a part in an AM machine, it may only take a few hours; and infact multiple parts are often batched together inside a single AM build. Finishingmay take a few days if the requirement is for high quality. Using CNC machining,even 5-axis high-speed machining, this same process may take weeks with consid-erably more uncertainty over the completion time. 1.6.3 Complexity As mentioned above, the higher the geometric complexity, the greater the advan-tage AM has over CNC. If CNC is being used to create a part directly in a singlepiece, then there may be some geometric features that cannot be fabricated. Since amachining tool must be carried in a spindle, there may be certain accessibilityconstraints or clashes preventing the tool from being located on the machiningsurface of a part. AM processes are not constrained in the same way and undercuts and internal features can be easily built without speciﬁc process planning. Certain parts cannot be fabricated by CNC unless they are broken up into components andreassembled at a later stage. Consider, for example, the possibility of machining aship inside a bottle. How would you machine the ship while it is still inside thebottle? Most likely you would machine both elements separately and work out away to combine them together as an assembly and/or joining process. With AM youcan build the ship and the bottle all at once. An expert in machining must thereforeanalyze each part prior to it being built to ensure that it indeed can be built and to determine what methods need to be used. While it is still possible that some parts cannot be built with AM, the likelihood is much lower and there are generally waysin which this may be overcome without too much difﬁculty. 1.6.4 Accuracy AM machines generally operate with a resolution of a few tens of microns. It iscommon for AM machines to also have different resolution along different orthog-onal axes. Typically, the vertical build axis corresponds to layer thickness and this would be of a lower resolution compared with the two axes in the build plane. Accuracy in the build plane is determined by the positioning of the build mecha-nism, which will normally involve gearboxes and motors of some kind. Thismechanism may also determine the minimum feature size as well. For example,SL uses a laser as part of the build mechanism that will normally be positionedusing galvanometric mirror drives. The resolution of the galvanometers would1.6 Distinction Between AM and CNC Machining 11determine the overall dimensions of parts built, while the diameter of the laser beam would determine the minimum wall thickness. The accuracy of CNC machines onthe other hand is mainly determined by a similar positioning resolution along all three orthogonal axes and by the diameter of the rotary cutting tools. There are factors that are deﬁned by the tool geometry, like the radius of internal corners, butwall thickness can be thinner than the tool diameter since it is a subtractive process.In both cases very ﬁne detail will also be a function of the desired geometry andproperties of the build material. 1.6.5 Geometry AM machines essentially break up a complex, 3D problem into a series of simple2D cross-sections with a nominal thickness. In this way, the connection of surfacesin 3D is removed and continuity is determined by how close the proximity of onecross-section is with an adjacent one. Since this cannot be easily done in CNC,machining of surfaces must normally be generated in 3D space. With simplegeometries, like cylinders, cuboids, cones, etc., this is a relatively easy processdeﬁned by joining points along a path; these points being quite far apart and the toolorientation being ﬁxed. In cases of freeform surfaces, these points can become very close together with many changes in orientation. Such geometry can become extremely difﬁcult to produce with CNC, even with 5-axis interpolated control orgreater. Undercuts, enclosures, sharp internal corners, and other features can all failif these features are beyond a certain limit. Consider, for example, the featuresrepresented in the part in Fig. 1.3. Many of them would be very difﬁcult to machine without manipulation of the part at various stages. 1.6.6 Programming Determining the program sequence for a CNC machine can be very involved,including tool selection, machine speed settings, approach position and angle, etc.Many AM machines also have options that must be selected, but the range,complexity, and implications surrounding their choice are minimal in comparison.The worst that is likely to happen in most AM machines is that the part will not bebuilt very well if the programming is not done properly. Incorrect programming of aCNC machine could result in severe damage to the machine and may even be a human safety risk. 1.7 Example AM Parts Figure 1.4shows a montage of parts fabricated using some of the common AM processes. Part a. was fabricated using a stereolithography machine and depicts asimpliﬁed fuselage for an unmanned aerial vehicle where the skin is reinforced with12 1 Introduction and Basic Principlesa conformal lattice structure (see Chap. 4for more information about the process). A more complete description of this part is included in the Design for AdditiveManufacturing chapter. Parts b. and c. were fabricated using material jetting(Chap. 7). Part b. demonstrates the capability of depositing multiple materials simultaneously, where one set of nozzles deposited the clear material, while another The cavity here may be too deep to machine The undercut here cannot be performed without more than 3 axis machining Base cannot be machined since machine must hold using a fixtureSharp internal features cannot be machined without a tool radius Fig. 1.3 Features that represent problems using CNC machining Fig. 1.4 Montage of AM parts1.7 Example AM Parts 13set deposited the black material for the lines and the Objet name. Part c. is a section of chain. Both parts b. and c. have working revolute joints that were fabricated usingclearances for the joints and dissolvable support structure. Part d. is a metal part that was fabricated in a metal powder bed fusion machine using an electron beam as its energy source (Chap. 5). The part is a model of a facial implant. Part e. was fabricated in an Mcor Technologies sheet lamination machine that has ink-jetprinting capability for the multiple colors (Chap. 9). Parts f. and g. were fabricated using material extrusion (Chap. 6). Part f. is a ratchet mechanism that was fabricated in a single build in an industrial machine. Again, the working mechanism is achievedthrough proper joint designs and dissolvable support structure. Part g. was fabricatedin a low-cost, personal machine (that one of the authors has at home). Parts h. and i. were fabricated using polymer powder bed fusion. Part h. is the well-known “brain gear” model of a three-dimensional gear train. When one gear is rotated, all othergears rotate as well. Since parts fabricated in polymer PBF do not need supports,working revolute and gear joints can be created by managing clearances andremoving the loose powder from the joint regions. Part i. is another conformal latticestructure showing the shape complexity capability of AM technologies. 1.8 Other Related Technologies The most common input method for AM technology is to accept a ﬁle convertedinto the STL ﬁle format originally built within a conventional 3D CAD system.There are, however, other ways in which the STL ﬁles can be generated and othertechnologies that can be used in conjunction with AM technology. This section will describe a few of these. 1.8.1 Reverse Engineering Technology More and more models are being built from data generated using reverse engineer- ing (RE) 3D imaging equipment and software. In this context, RE is the process ofcapturing geometric data from another object. These data are usually initiallyavailable in what is termed “point cloud” form, meaning an unconnected set ofpoints representing the object surfaces. These points need to be connected togetherusing RE software like Geomagic [ 7], which may also be used to combine point clouds from different scans and to perform other functions like hole-ﬁlling and smoothing. In many cases, the data will not be entirely complete. Samples may, for example, need to be placed in a holding ﬁxture and thus the surfaces adjacent to thisﬁxture may not be scanned. In addition, some surfaces may obscure others, likewith deep crevices and internal features; so that the representation may not turn outexactly how the object is in reality. Recently there have been huge improvements inscanning technology. An adapted handphone using its inbuilt camera can nowproduce a high-quality 3D scan for just a few hundred dollars that even just a few14 1 Introduction and Basic Principlesyears ago would have required an expensive laser-scanning or stereoscopic camera system costing $100,000 or more. Engineered objects would normally be scanned using laser-scanning or touch- probe technology. Objects that have complex internal features or anatomical models may make use of Computerized Tomography (CT), which was initiallydeveloped for medical imaging but is also available for scanning industriallyproduced objects. This technique essentially works in a similar way to AM, byscanning layer by layer and using software to join these layers and identify thesurface boundaries. Boundaries from adjacent layers are then connected together toform surfaces. The advantage of CT technology is that internal features can also begenerated. High-energy X-rays are used in industrial technology to create high- resolution images of around 1 μm. Another approach that can help digitize objects is the Capture Geometry Inside [ 8] technology that also works very much like a reverse of AM technology, where 2D imaging is used to capture cross-sections of apart as it is machined away layer by layer. Obviously this is a destructive approachto geometry capture so it cannot be used for every type of product. AM can be used to reproduce the articles that were scanned, which essentially would form a kind of 3D facsimile (3D Fax) process. More likely, however, the datawill be modiﬁed and/or combined with other data to form complex, freeform artifacts that are taking advantage of the “complexity for free” feature of the technology. An example may be where individual patient data are combined withan engineering design to form a customized medical implant. This is something thatwill be discussed in much more detail later on in this book. 1.8.2 Computer-Aided Engineering 3D CAD is an extremely valuable resource for product design and development.One major beneﬁt to using software-based design is the ability to implement changeeasily and cheaply. If we are able to keep the design primarily in a software formatfor a larger proportion of the product development cycle, we can ensure that any design changes are performed virtually on the software description rather than physically on the product itself. The more we know about how the product isgoing to perform before it is built, the more effective that product is going to be. This is also the most cost-effective way to deal with product development. Ifproblems are only noticed after parts are physically manufactured, this can be verycostly. 3D CAD can make use of AM to help visualize and perform basic tests oncandidate designs prior to full-scale commitment to manufacturing. However, themore complex and performance-related the design, the less likely we are to gain sufﬁcient insight using these methods. However, 3D CAD is also commonly linked to other software packages, often using techniques like ﬁnite element method(FEM) to calculate the mechanical properties of a design, collectively known asComputer-Aided Engineering (CAE) software. Forces, dynamics, stresses, ﬂow,and other properties can be calculated to determine how well a design will performunder certain conditions. While such software cannot easily predict the exact1.8 Other Related Technologies 15behavior of a part, for analysis of critical parts a combination of CAE, backed up with AM-based experimental analysis, may be a useful solution. Further, with theadvent of Direct Digital Manufacture, where AM can be used to directly produce ﬁnal products, there is an increasing need for CAE tools to evaluate how these parts would perform prior to AM so that we can build these products right ﬁrst time as aform of Design for Additive Manufacturing (D for AM). 1.8.3 Haptic-Based CAD 3D CAD systems are generally built on the principle that models are constructedfrom basic geometric shapes that are then combined in different ways to make morecomplex forms. This works very well for the engineered products we are familiar with, but may not be so effective for more unusual designs. Many consumer products are developed from ideas generated by artists and designers rather thanengineers. We also note that AM has provided a mechanism for greater freedom ofexpression. AM is in fact now becoming a popular tool for artists and sculptors,like, for example, Bathsheba Grossman [ 9] who takes advantage of the geometric freedom to create visually exciting sculptures. One problem we face today is thatsome computer-based design tools constrain or restrict the creative processes andthat there is scope for a CAD system that provides greater freedom. Haptic-based CAD modeling systems like the experimental system shown in Fig. 1.5[10], work in a similar way to the commercially available Freeform [ 11] modeling system to provide a design environment that is more intuitive than other standard CADsystems. They often use a robotic haptic feedback device called the Phantom to Fig. 1.5 Freeform modeling system16 1 Introduction and Basic Principlesprovide force feedback relating to the virtual modeling environment. An object can be seen on-screen, but also felt in 3D space using the Phantom. The modelingenvironment includes what is known as Virtual Clay that deforms under force applied using the haptic cursor. This provides a mechanism for direct interaction with the modeling material, much like how a sculptor interacts with actual clay. Theresults using this system are generally much more organic and freeform surfacesthat can be incorporated into product designs by using additional engineering CADtools. As consumers become more demanding and discerning we can see that CADtools for non-engineers like designers, sculptors, and even members of the generalpublic are likely to become much more commonplace. 1.9 About this Book There have been a number of texts describing additive manufacturing processes,either as dedicated books or as sections in other books. So far, however, there have been no texts dedicated to teaching this technology in a comprehensive way within a university setting. Recently, universities have been incorporating additivemanufacturing into various curricula. This has varied from segments of singlemodules to complete postgraduate courses. This text is aimed at supporting thesecurricula with a comprehensive coverage of as many aspects of this technology aspossible. The authors of this text have all been involved in setting up programs intheir home universities and have written this book because they feel that there areno books to date that cover the required material in sufﬁcient breadth and depth. Furthermore, with the increasing interest in 3D Printing, we believe that this text can also provide a comprehensive understanding of the technologies involved.Despite the increased popularity, it is clear that there is a signiﬁcant lack of basicunderstanding by many of the breadth that AM has to offer. Early chapters in this book discuss general aspects of AM, followed by chapters which focus on speciﬁc AM technologies. The ﬁnal chapters focus more on genericprocesses and applications. It is anticipated that the reader will be familiar with 3Dsolid modeling CAD technology and have at least a small amount of knowledge about product design, development, and manufacturing. The majority of readers would be expected to have an engineering or design background, more speciﬁcallyproduct design, or mechanical, materials or manufacturing engineering. Since AMtechnology also involves signiﬁcant electronic and information technologycomponents, readers with a background in computer applications and mechatronicsmay also ﬁnd this text beneﬁcial. 1.10 Exercises Find three other deﬁnitions for rapid prototyping other than that of additive manufacturing as covered by this book.1.10 Exercises 172.

For example it would not be possible for AM to exist were it notfor innovations in areas like 3D graphics and Computer-Aided Design software.This chapter highlights some of the key moments that catalogue the developmentof Additive Manufacturing technology. It will describe how the different technologies converged to a state where they could be integrated into AM machines. It will also discuss milestone AM technologies and how they havecontributed to increase the range of AM applications. Furthermore, we willdiscuss how the application of Additive Manufacturing has evolved to includegreater functionality and embrace a wider range of applications beyond theinitial intention of just prototyping. 2.1 Introduction Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology came about as a result of developmentsin a variety of different technology sectors. Like with many manufacturingtechnologies, improvements in computing power and reduction in mass storagecosts paved the way for processing the large amounts of data typical of modern 3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models within reasonable time frames. Nowadays, we have become quite accustomed to having powerful computers and other com-plex automated machines around us and sometimes it may be difﬁcult for us toimagine how the pioneers struggled to develop the ﬁrst AM machines. This chapter highlights some of the key moments that catalogue the develop- ment of Additive Manufacturing technology. It will describe how the differenttechnologies converged to a state where they could be integrated into AMmachines. It will also discuss milestone AM technologies. Furthermore, we will discuss how the application of Additive Manufacturing has evolved to include #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_219greater functionality and embrace a wider range of applications beyond the initial intention of just prototyping. 2.2 Computers Like many other technologies, AM came about as a result of the invention of the computer. However, there was little indication that the ﬁrst computers built in the 1940s (like the Zuse Z3 [ 1], ENIAC [ 2] and EDSAC [ 3] computers) would change lives in the way that they so obviously have. Inventions like the thermionic valve,transistor, and microchip made it possible for computers to become faster, smaller,and cheaper with greater functionality. This development has been so quick thateven Bill Gates of Microsoft was caught off-guard when he thought in 1981 that640 kb of memory would be sufﬁcient for any Windows-based computer. In 1989,he admitted his error when addressing the University of Waterloo Computer Science Club [ 4]. Similarly in 1977, Ken Olsen of Digital Electronics Corp. (DEC) stated that there would never be any reason for people to have computersin their homes when he addressed the World Future Society in Boston [ 5]. That remarkable misjudgment may have caused Olsen to lose his job not longafterwards. One key to the development of computers as serviceable tools lies in their ability to perform tasks in real-time. In the early days, serious computational tasks tookmany hours or even days to prepare, run, and complete. This served as a hindrance to everyday computer use and it is only since it was shown that tasks can be completed in real-time that computers have been accepted as everyday items ratherthan just for academics or big business. This has included the ability to displayresults not just numerically but graphically as well. For this we owe a debt of thanksat least in part to the gaming industry, which has pioneered many developments ingraphics technology with the aim to display more detailed and more “realistic”images to enhance the gaming experience. AM takes full advantage of many of the important features of computer technol- ogy, both directly (in the AM machines themselves) and indirectly (within the supporting technology), including: –Processing power: Part data ﬁles can be very large and require a reasonable amount of processing power to manipulate while setting up the machine andwhen slicing the data before building. Earlier machines would have had difﬁ-culty handling large CAD data ﬁles. –Graphics capability: AM machine operation does not require a big graphics engine except to see the ﬁle while positioning within the virtual machine space. However, all machines beneﬁt from a good graphical user interface (GUI) thatcan make the machine easier to set up, operate, and maintain. –Machine control: AM technology requires precise positioning of equipment in a similar way to a Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machining center, oreven a high-end photocopy machine or laser printer. Such equipment requires20 2 Development of Additive Manufacturing Technologycontrollers that take information from sensors for determining status and actuators for positioning and other output functions. Computation is generallyrequired in order to determine the control requirements. Conducting these control tasks even in real-time does not normally require signiﬁcant amounts of processing power by today’s standards. Dedicated functions like positioningof motors, lenses, etc. would normally require individual controller modules. Acomputer would be used to oversee the communication to and from thesecontrollers and pass data related to the part build function. –Networking: Nearly every computer these days has a method for communicating with other computers around the world. Files for building would normally bedesigned on another computer to that running the AM machine. Earlier systems would have required the ﬁles to be loaded from disk or tape. Nowadays almost all ﬁles will be sent using an Ethernet connection, often via the Internet. –Integration: As is indicated by the variety of functions, the computer forms a central component that ties different processes together. The purpose of thecomputer would be to communicate with other parts of the system, to processdata, and to send that data from one part of the system to the other. Figure 2.1 shows how the above mentioned technologies are integrated to form an AMmachine.

Workstations that generally ran the graphics and input/output functions were connected to these computers. The computer then ran the complex calculations for manipulating the models. This was a costly solution based around the fact that the processor and memory components were very expensiveelements. With the reduction in the cost of these components, Personal Computers(PCs) became viable solutions. Earlier PCs were not powerful enough to replace thecomplex functions that workstation-based computers could perform, but the speedydevelopment of PCs soon overcame all but the most computationally expensiverequirements. Without computers there would be no capability to display 3D graphic images. Without 3D graphics, there would be no CAD. Without this ability to represent objects digitally in 3D, we would have a limited desire to use machines to fabricateanything but the simplest shapes. It is safe to say, therefore, that without thecomputers we have today, we would not have seen Additive Manufacturingdevelop. 2.3 Computer-Aided Design Technology Today, every engineering student must learn how to use computers for many oftheir tasks, including the development of new designs. CAD technologies areavailable for assisting in the design of large buildings and of nano-scalemicroprocessors. CAD technology holds within it the knowledge associated witha particular type of product, including geometric, electrical, thermal, dynamic, andstatic behavior. CAD systems may contain rules associated with such behaviors thatallow the user to focus on design and functionality without worrying too much whether a product can or cannot work. CAD also allows the user to focus on small features of a large product, maintaining data integrity and ordering it to understandhow subsystems integrate with the remainder. Additive Manufacturing technology primarily makes use of the output from mechanical engineering, 3D Solid Modeling CAD software. It is important tounderstand that this is only a branch of a much larger set of CAD systems and,therefore, not all CAD systems will produce output suitable for layer-based AMtechnology. Currently, AM technology focuses on reproducing geometric form and so the better CAD systems to use are those that produce such forms in the most precise and effective way. Early CAD systems were extremely limited by the display technology. The ﬁrst display systems had little or no capacity to produce anything other than alphanu-meric text output. Some early computers had specialized graphic output devicesthat displayed graphics separate from the text commands used to drive them. Evenso, the geometric forms were shown primarily in a vector form, displaying wire-frame output. As well as the heavy demand on the computing power required to display the graphics for such systems, this was because most displays were22 2 Development of Additive Manufacturing Technologymonochrome, making it very difﬁcult to show 3D geometric forms on screen without lighting and shading effects. CAD would not have developed so quickly if it were not for the demands set by Computer-Aided Manufacture (CAM). CAM represents a channel for converting the virtual models developed in CAD into the physical products that we use in oureveryday lives. It is doubtful that without the demands associated with this conver-sion from virtual to real that CAD would have developed so far or so quickly. This,in turn, was fuelled and driven by the developments in associated technologies, likeprocessor, memory, and display technologies. CAM systems produce the code fornumerically controlled (NC) machinery, essentially combining coordinate datawith commands to select and actuate the cutting tools. Early NC technologies would take CAM data relating to the location of machined features, like holes, slots, pockets, etc. These features would then be fabricated by machining from astock material. As NC machines proved their value in their precise, automatedfunctionality, the sophistication of the features increased. This has now extended tothe ability to machine highly complex, freeform surfaces. However, there are twokey limitations to all NC machining: – Almost every part must be made in stages, often requiring multiple passes for material removal and setups. – All machining is performed from an approach direction (sometimes referred to as 2.5D rather than fully 3D manufacture). This requires that the stock materialbe held in a particular orientation and that not all the material can be accessibleat any one stage in the process. NC machining, therefore, only requires surface modeling software. All early CAM systems were based on surface modeling CAD. AM technology was the ﬁrst automated computer-aided manufacturing process that truly required 3D solid modeling CAD. It was necessary to have a fully enclosed surface to generate thedriving coordinates for AM. This can be achieved using surface modeling systems,but because surfaces are described by boundary curves it is often difﬁcult toprecisely and seamlessly connect these together. Even if the gaps are imperceptible,the resulting models may be difﬁcult to build using AM. At the very least, anyinaccuracies in the 3D model would be passed on to the AM part that wasconstructed. Early AM applications often displayed difﬁculties because of associated problems with surface modeling software. Since it is important for AM systems to have accurate models that are fully enclosed, the preference is for solid modeling CAD. Solid modeling CAD ensuresthat all models made have a volume and, therefore, by deﬁnition are fully enclosedsurfaces. While surface modeling can be used in part construction, we cannotalways be sure that the ﬁnal model is faithfully represented as a solid. Such modelsare generally necessary for Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) tools like FiniteElement Analysis (FEA), but are also very important for other CAM processes. Most CAD systems can now quite readily run on PCs. This is generally a result of the improvements in computer technology mentioned earlier, but is also a result2.3 Computer-Aided Design Technology 23in improvements in the way CAD data is presented, manipulated, and stored. Most CAD systems these days utilize Non-Uniform Rational Basis-Splines, or NURBS[6]. NURBS are an excellent way of precisely deﬁning the curves and surfaces that correspond to the outer shell of a CAD model. Since model deﬁnitions can include free form surfaces as well as simple geometric shapes, the representation mustaccommodate this and splines are complex enough to represent such shapes withoutmaking the ﬁles too large and unwieldy. They are also easy to manipulate to modifythe resulting shape. CAD technology has rapidly improved along the following lines: –Realism: With lighting and shading effects, ray tracing and other photorealistic imaging techniques, it is becoming possible to generate images of the CAD models that are difﬁcult to distinguish from actual photographs. In some ways,this reduces the requirements on AM models for visualization purposes. –Usability and user interface: Early CAD software required the input of text- based instructions through a dialog box. Development of Windows-based GUIshas led to graphics-based dialogs and even direct manipulation of models withinvirtual 3D environments. Instructions are issued through the use of drop-downmenu systems and context-related commands. To suit different user preferences and styles, it is often possible to execute the same instruction in different ways. Keyboards are still necessary for input of speciﬁc measurements, but the usabil-ity of CAD systems has improved dramatically. There is still some way to go tomake CAD systems available to those without engineering knowledge or with-out training, however. –Engineering content: Since CAD is almost an essential part of a modern engineer’s training, it is vital that the software includes as much engineeringcontent as possible. With solid modeling CAD it is possible to calculate the volumes and masses of models, investigate ﬁts and clearances according to tolerance variations, and to export ﬁles with mesh data for FEA. FEA is ofteneven possible without having to leave the CAD system. –Speed: As mentioned previously, the use of NURBS assists in optimizing CAD data manipulation. CAD systems are constantly being optimized in variousways, mainly by exploiting the hardware developments of computers. –Accuracy: If high tolerances are expected for a design then it is important that calculations are precise. High precision can make heavy demands on processing time and memory. –Complexity: All of the above characteristics can lead to extremely complex systems. It is a challenge to software vendors to incorporate these featureswithout making them unwieldy and unworkable. –Usability: Recent developments in CAD technology have focused on making the systems available to a wider range of users. In particular the aim has been toallow untrained users to be able to design complex geometry parts for them-selves. There are now 3D solid modeling CAD systems that run entirely within a web browser with similar capabilities of workstation systems of only 10 years ago.24 2 Development of Additive Manufacturing TechnologyMany CAD software vendors are focusing on producing highly integrated design environments that allow designers to work as teams and to share designs across different platforms and for different departments. Industrial designers must work with sales and marketing, engineering designers, analysts, manufacturing engineers, and many other branches of an organization to bring a design to fruition as a product. Such branches may even be in different regions of the world and may be part of the same organization or acting as subcontractors. The Internet must therefore also be integrated with these software systems, with appropriate measures for fast and accurate transmission and protection of intellectual property. It is quite possible to directly manipulate the CAD ﬁle to generate the slice data that will drive an AM machine, and this is commonly referred to as direct slicing [7]. However, this would mean every CAD system must have a direct slicing algorithm that would have to be compatible with all the different types of AM technology. Alternatively, each AM system vendor would have to write a routine for every CAD system. Both of these approaches are impractical. The solution is to use a generic format that is speciﬁc to the technology. This generic format was developed by 3D Systems, USA, who was the ﬁrst company to commercialize AM technology and called the ﬁle format “STL” after their stereolithography technol- ogy (an example of which is shown in Fig. 2.2). The STL ﬁle format was made public domain to allow all CAD vendors to access it easily and hopefully integrate it into their systems. This strategy has been successful and STL is now a standard output for nearly all solid modeling CAD systems and has also been adopted by AM system vendors [ 8]. STL uses triangles to describe the surfaces to be built. Each triangle is described as three points and a facet normal vector indicating the outward side of the triangle, in a manner similar to the following: facet normal /C04.470293E /C002 7.003503E /C001/C07.123981E-01 outer loop vertex/C02.812284E + 00 2.298693E + 01 0.000000E + 00 vertex/C02.812284E + 00 2.296699E + 01 /C01.960784E /C002 vertex/C03.124760E + 00 2.296699E + 01 0.000000E + 00 endloop endfacet Fig. 2.2 A CAD model on the leftconverted into STL format on the right2.3 Computer-Aided Design Technology 25The demands on CAD technology in the future are set to change with respect to AM. As we move toward more and more functionality in the parts produced by AM,we must understand that the CAD system must include rules associated with AM. To date, the focus has been on the external geometry. In the future, we may need to know rules associated with how the AM systems function so that the outputcan be optimized. 2.4 Other Associated Technologies Aside from computer technology there are a number of other technologies that havedeveloped along with AM that are worthy of note here since they have served tocontribute to further improvement of AM systems. 2.4.1 Lasers Many of the earliest AM systems were based on laser technology. The reasons arethat lasers provide a high intensity and highly collimated beam of energy that can bemoved very quickly in a controlled manner with the use of directional mirrors.Since AM requires the material in each layer to be solidiﬁed or joined in a selectivemanner, lasers are ideal candidates for use, provided the laser energy is compatible with the material transformation mechanisms. There are two kinds of laser processing used in AM; curing and heating. With photopolymer resins the require-ment is for laser energy of a speciﬁc frequency that will cause the liquid resin tosolidify, or “cure.” Usually this laser is in the ultraviolet range but other frequenciescan be used. For heating, the requirement is for the laser to carry sufﬁcient thermalenergy to cut through a layer of solid material, to cause powder to melt, or to causesheets of material to fuse. For powder processes, for example, the key is to melt thematerial in a controlled fashion without creating too great a build-up of heat, so that when the laser energy is removed, the molten material rapidly solidiﬁes again. For cutting, the intention is to separate a region of material from another in the form oflaser cutting. Earlier AM machines used tube lasers to provide the required energybut many manufacturers have more recently switched to solid-state technology,which provides greater efﬁciency, lifetime, and reliability. 2.4.2 Printing Technologies Ink-jet or droplet printing technology has rapidly developed in recent years.Improvements in resolution and reduction in costs has meant that high-resolutionprinting, often with multiple colors, is available as part of our everyday lives. Suchimprovement in resolution has also been supported by improvement in materialhandling capacity and reliability. Initially, colored inks were low in viscosity andfed into the print heads at ambient temperatures. Now it is possible to generate26 2 Development of Additive Manufacturing Technologymuch higher pressures within the droplet formation chamber so that materials with much higher viscosity and even molten materials can be printed. This means thatdroplet deposition can now be used to print photocurable and molten resins as wellas binders for powder systems. Since print heads are relatively compact deviceswith all the droplet control technology highly integrated into these heads (like the one shown in Fig. 2.3), it is possible to produce low-cost, high-resolution, high- throughput AM technology. In the same way that other AM technologies haveapplied the mass-produced laser technology, other technologies have piggy-backedupon the larger printing industry. 2.4.3 Programmable Logic Controllers The input CAD models for AM are large data ﬁles generated using standardcomputer technology. Once they are on the AM machine, however, these ﬁles arereduced to a series of process stages that require sensor input and signaling ofactuators. This is process and machine control that often is best carried out usingmicrocontroller systems rather than microprocessor systems. Industrial microcon- troller systems form the basis of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), which are used to reliably control industrial processes. Designing and building industrialmachinery, like AM machines, is much easier using building blocks based aroundmodern PLCs for coordinating and controlling the various steps in the machineprocess. 2.4.4 Materials Earlier AM technologies were built around materials that were already availableand that had been developed to suit other processes. However, the AM processes are Jetting Head Fullcure M (Model Material) Fullcure S (Support Material) Build TrayX axis Y axis UV Light Z axis Fig. 2.3 Printer technology used on an AM machine (photo courtesy of Stratasys)2.4 Other Associated Technologies 27somewhat unique and these original materials were far from ideal for these new applications. For example, the early photocurable resins resulted in models thatwere brittle and that warped easily. Powders used in laser-based powder bed fusion processes degraded quickly within the machine and many of the materials used resulted in parts that were quite weak. As we came to understand the technologybetter, materials were developed speciﬁcally to suit AM processes. Materials havebeen tuned to suit more closely the operating parameters of the different processesand to provide better output parts. As a result, parts are now much more accurate,stronger, and longer lasting and it is even possible to process metals with some AMtechnologies. In turn, these new materials have resulted in the processes being tunedto produce higher temperature materials, smaller feature sizes, and faster throughput. 2.4.5 Computer Numerically Controlled Machining One of the reasons AM technology was originally developed was because CNC technology was not able to produce satisfactory output within the required timeframes. CNC machining was slow, cumbersome, and difﬁcult to operate. AMtechnology on the other hand was quite easy to set up with quick results, but hadpoor accuracy and limited material capability. As improvements in AM technologies came about, vendors of CNC machining technology realized that there was now growing competition. CNC machining has dramatically improved,just as AM technologies have matured. It could be argued that high-speed CNCwould have developed anyway, but some have argued that the perceived threat fromAM technology caused CNC machining vendors to rethink how their machineswere made. The development of hybrid prototyping technologies, such as SpacePuzzle Molding that use both high-speed machining and additive techniques formaking large, complex and durable molds and components, as shown in Fig. 2.4 [9], illustrate how the two can be used interchangeably to take advantage of the beneﬁts of both technologies. For geometries that can be machined using a singleset-up orientation, CNC machining is often the fastest, most cost-effective method.For parts with complex geometries or parts which require a large proportion of theoverall material volume to be machined away as scrap, AM can be used to morequickly and economically produce the part than when using CNC. 2.5 The Use of Layers A key enabling principle of AM part manufacture is the use of layers as ﬁnite 2Dcross-sections of the 3D model. Almost every AM technology builds parts usinglayers of material added together; and certainly all commercial systems work thatway, primarily due to the simpliﬁcation of building 3D objects. Using 2Drepresentations to represent cross-sections of a more complex 3D feature hasbeen common in many applications outside AM. The most obvious example of28 2 Development of Additive Manufacturing Technologythis is how cartographers use a line of constant height to represent hills and other geographical reliefs. These contour lines, or iso-heights, can be used as plates that can be stacked to form representations of geographical regions. The gaps between these 2D cross-sections cannot be precisely represented and are therefore approximated, or interpolated, in the form of continuity curves connecting these layers. Such techniques can also be used to provide a 3D representation of other physical properties, like isobars or isotherms on weather maps. Architects have also used such methods to represent landscapes of actual or planned areas, like that used by an architect ﬁrm in Fig. 2.5[10]. The concept is particularly logical to manufacturers of buildings who also use an additive Fig. 2.4 Space puzzle molding, where molds are constructed in segments for fast and easy fabrication and assembly (photo courtesy of Protoform, Germany) Fig. 2.5 An architectural landscape model, illustrating the use of layers (photo courtesy of LiD)2.5 The Use of Layers 29approach, albeit not using layers. Consider how the pyramids in Egypt and in South America were created. Notwithstanding how they were fabricated, it’s clear thatthey were created using a layered approach, adding material as they went. 2.6 Classification of AM Processes There are numerous ways to classify AM technologies. A popular approach is toclassify according to baseline technology, like whether the process uses lasers,printer technology, extrusion technology, etc. [ 11,12]. Another approach is to collect processes together according to the type of raw material input [ 13]. The problem with these classiﬁcation methods is that some processes get lumpedtogether in what seems to be odd combinations (like Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) being grouped together with 3D Printing) or that some processes that may appear to produce similar results end up being separated (like Stereolithographyand material jetting with photopolymers). It is probably inappropriate, therefore, touse a single classiﬁcation approach. An excellent and comprehensive classiﬁcation method is described by Pham [14], which uses a two-dimensional classiﬁcation method as shown in Fig. 2.6. The ﬁrst dimension relates to the method by which the layers are constructed. Earliertechnologies used a single point source to draw across the surface of the base material. Later systems increased the number of sources to increase the throughput, which was made possible with the use of droplet deposition technology, forexample, which can be constructed into a one dimensional array of deposition 1D Channel 2x1D Channels 2D Channel Array of 1D Channels SLA (3D Sys)Dual beam SLA (3D Sys)Objet DPSEnvisiontech MicroTEC 3D Printing ThermoJetLST (EOS) Solido PLT (KIRA)FDM, SolidscapeSLS (3D Sys), LST (EOS), LENS Phenix, SDMLiquid PolymerDiscrete ParticlesMolten Mat.Solid SheetsX X XYX1Y1 X2Y2 Y Fig. 2.6 Layered manufacturing (LM) processes as classiﬁed by Pham (note that this diagram has been amended to include some recent AM technologies)30 2 Development of Additive Manufacturing Technologyheads. Further throughput improvements are possible with the use of 2D array technology using the likes of Digital Micro-mirror Devices (DMDs) and high-resolution display technology, capable of exposing an entire surface in a single pass. However, just using this classiﬁcation results in the previously mentioned anomalies where numerous dissimilar processes are grouped together. This issolved by introducing a second dimension of raw material to the classiﬁcation.Pham uses four separate material classiﬁcations; liquid polymer, discrete particles,molten material, and laminated sheets. Some more exotic systems mentioned in thisbook may not ﬁt directly into this classiﬁcation. An example is the possibledeposition of composite material using an extrusion-based technology. This ﬁtswell as a 1D channel but the material is not explicitly listed, although it could be argued that the composite is extruded as a molten material. Furthermore, future systems may be developed that use 3D holography to project and fabricate completeobjects in a single pass. As with many classiﬁcations, there can sometimes beprocesses or systems that lie outside them. If there are sufﬁcient systems to warrantan extension to this classiﬁcation, then it should not be a problem. It should be noted that, in particular 1D and 2 /C21D channel systems combine both vector- and raster-based scanning methods. Often, the outline of a layer istraced ﬁrst before being ﬁlled in with regular or irregular scanning patterns. The outline is generally referred to as vector scanned while the ﬁll pattern can often be generalized as a raster pattern. The array methods tend not to separate the outlineand the ﬁll. Most AM technology started using a 1D channel approach, although one of the earliest and now obsolete technologies, Solid Ground Curing from Cubital, usedliquid photopolymers and essentially (although perhaps arguably) a 2D channelmethod. As technology developed, so more of the boxes in the classiﬁcation arraybegan to be ﬁlled. The empty boxes in this array may serve as a guide to researchers and developers for further technological advances. Most of the 1D array methods use at least 2 /C21D lines. This is similar to conventional 2D printing where each line deposits a different material in different locations within a layer. The recent Connexprocess using the Polyjet technology from Stratasys is a good example of this whereit is now possible to create parts with different material properties in a single stepusing this approach. Color 3D Printing is possible using multiple 1D arrays with inkor separately colored material in each. Note however that the part coloration in thesheet laminating Mcor process [ 15] is separated from the layer formation process, which is why it is deﬁned as a 1D channel approach. 2.6.1 Liquid Polymer Systems As can be seen from Fig. 2.5liquid polymers appear to be a popular material. The ﬁrst commercial system was the 3D Systems Stereolithography process based onliquid photopolymers. A large portion of systems in use today are, in fact, not justliquid polymer systems but more speciﬁcally liquid photopolymer systems. How-ever, this classiﬁcation should not be restricted to just photopolymers, since a2.6 Classification of AM Processes 31number of experimental systems are using hydrogels that would also ﬁt into this category. Furthermore, the Fab@home system developed at Cornell University inthe USA and the open source RepRap systems originating from Bath University in the UK also use liquid polymers with curing techniques other than UV or other wavelength optical curing methods [ 16,17]. Using this material and a 1D channel or 2 /C21D channel scanning method, the best option is to use a laser like in the Stereolithography process. Droplet depositionof polymers using an array of 1D channels can simplify the curing process to aﬂoodlight (for photopolymers) or similar method. This approach is used withmachines made by the Israeli company Objet (now part of Stratasys) who usesprinter technology to print ﬁne droplets of photopolymer “ink” [ 18]. One unique feature of the Objet system is the ability to vary the material properties within a single part. Parts can for example have soft-feel, rubber-like features combinedwith more solid resins to achieve a result similar to an overmolding effect. Controlling the area to be exposed using DMDs or other high-resolution display technology obviates the need for any scanning at all, thus increasing throughput andreducing the number of moving parts. DMDs are generally applied to micron-scaleadditive approaches, like those used by Microtec in Germany [ 19]. For normal- scale systems Envisiontec uses high-resolution DMD displays to cure photopoly- mer resin in their low-cost AM machines. The 3D Systems V-Flash process is also a variation on this approach, exposing thin sheets of polymer spread onto a buildsurface. 2.6.2 Discrete Particle Systems Discrete particles are normally powders that are generally graded into a relativelyuniform particle size and shape and narrow size distribution. The ﬁner the particlesthe better, but there will be problems if the dimensions get too small in terms ofcontrolling the distribution and dispersion. Again, the conventional 1D channelapproach is to use a laser, this time to produce thermal energy in a controlled manner and, therefore, raise the temperature sufﬁciently to melt the powder. Polymer powders must therefore exhibit thermoplastic behavior so that they canbe melted and re-melted to permit bonding of one layer to another. There are a widevariety of such systems that generally differ in terms of the material that can beprocessed. The two main polymer-based systems commercially available are theSLS technology marketed by 3D Systems [ 20] and the EOSint processes developed by the German company EOS [ 21]. Application of printer technology to powder beds resulted in the (original) 3D Printing (3DP) process. This technique was developed by researchers at MIT in the USA [ 22]. Droplet printing technology is used to print a binder, or glue, onto a powder bed. The glue sticks the powder particles together to form a 3D structure.This basic technique has been developed for different applications dependent on thetype of powder and binder combination. The most successful approaches uselow-cost, starch- and plaster-based powders with inexpensive glues, as32 2 Development of Additive Manufacturing Technologycommercialized by ZCorp, USA [ 23], which is now part of 3D Systems. Ceramic powders and appropriate binders as similarly used in the Direct Shell ProductionCasting (DSPC) process used by Soligen [ 24] as part of a service to create shells for casting of metal parts. Alternatively, if the binder were to contain an amount of drug, 3DP can be used to create controlled delivery-rate drugs like in the processdeveloped by the US company Therics. Neither of these last two processes hasproven to be as successful as that licensed by ZCorp/3D Systems. One particularadvantage of the former ZCorp technology is that the binders can be jetted frommultinozzle print heads. Binders coming from different nozzles can be differentand, therefore, subtle variations can be incorporated into the resulting part. Themost obvious of these is the color that can be incorporated into parts. 2.6.3 Molten Material Systems Molten material systems are characterized by a pre-heating chamber that raises thematerial temperature to melting point so that it can ﬂow through a delivery system.The most well-known method for doing this is the Fused Deposition Modeling(FDM) material extrusion technology developed by the US company Stratasys[25]. This approach extrudes the material through a nozzle in a controlled manner. Two extrusion heads are often used so that support structures can be fabricated froma different material to facilitate part cleanup and removal. It should be noted thatthere are now a huge number of variants of this technology due to the lapse of key FDM patents, with the number of companies making these perhaps even into three ﬁgures. This competition has driven the price of these machines down to such alevel that individual buyers can afford to have their own machines at home. Printer technology has also been adapted to suit this material delivery approach. One technique, developed initially as the Sanders prototyping machine, that laterbecame Solidscape, USA [ 26] and which is now part of Stratasys, is a 1D channel system. A single jet piezoelectric deposition head lays down wax material. Anotherhead lays down a second wax material with a lower melting temperature that is used for support structures. The droplets from these print heads are very small so the resulting parts are ﬁne in detail. To further maintain the part precision, a planarcutting process is used to level each layer once the printing has been completed.Supports are removed by inserting the complete part into a temperature-controlledbath that melts the support material away, leaving the part material intact. The useof wax along with the precision of Solidscape machines makes this approach idealfor precision casting applications like jewelry, medical devices, and dental castings.Few machines are sold outside of these niche areas. The 1D channel approach, however, is very slow in comparison with other methods and applying a parallel element does signiﬁcantly improve throughput.The Thermojet technology from 3D Systems also deposits a wax material throughdroplet-based printing heads. The use of parallel print heads as an array of 1Dchannels effectively multiplies the deposition rate. The Thermojet approach, how-ever, is not widely used because wax materials are difﬁcult and fragile when2.6 Classification of AM Processes 33handled. Thermojet machines are no longer being made, although existing machines are commonly used for investment casting patterns. 2.6.4 Solid Sheet Systems One of the earliest AM technologies was the Laminated Object Manufacturing(LOM) system from Helisys, USA. This technology used a laser to cut out proﬁlesfrom sheet paper, supplied from a continuous roll, which formed the layers of theﬁnal part. Layers were bonded together using a heat-activated resin that was coatedon one surface of the paper. Once all the layers were bonded together the result wasvery much like a wooden block. A hatch pattern cut into the excess material allowedthe user to separate away waste material and reveal the part. A similar approach was used by the Japanese company Kira, in their Solid Center machine [ 27], and by the Israeli company Solidimension with their Solido machine. The major difference is that both these machines cut out the part proﬁleusing a blade similar to those found in vinyl sign-making machines, driven using a2D plotter drive. The Kira machine used a heat-activated adhesive applied usinglaser printing technology to bond the paper layers together. Both the Solido andKira machines have been discontinued for reasons like poor reliability materialwastage and the need for excessive amounts of manual post-processing. Recently, however, Mcor Technologies have produced a modern version of this technology, using low-cost color printing to make it possible to laminate color parts in a singleprocess [ 28]. 2.6.5 New AM Classification Schemes In this book, we use a version of Pham’s classiﬁcation introduced in Fig. 2.6. Instead of using the 1D and 2 /C21D channel terminology, we will typically use the terminology “point” or “point-wise” systems. For arrays of 1D channels, such as when using ink-jet print heads, we refer to this as “line” processing. 2D Channel technologies will be referred to as “layer” processing. Last, although no currentcommercialized processes are capable of this, holographic-like techniques areconsidered “volume” processing. The technology-speciﬁc descriptions starting in Chap. 4are based, in part, upon a separation of technologies into groups where processes which use a common typeof machine architecture and similar materials transformation physics are groupedtogether. This grouping is a reﬁnement of an approach introduced by Stucker and Janaki Ram in the CRC Materials Processing Handbook [ 29]. In this grouping scheme, for example, processes which use a common machine architecture devel-oped for stacking layers of powdered material and a materials transformationmechanism using heat to fuse those powders together are all discussed in thePowder Bed Fusion chapter. These are grouped together even though these pro-cesses encompass polymer, metal, ceramic, and composite materials, multiple types34 2 Development of Additive Manufacturing Technologyof energy sources (e.g., lasers, and infrared heaters), and point-wise and layer processing approaches. Using this classiﬁcation scheme, all AM processes fallinto one of seven categories. An understanding of these seven categories should enable a person familiar with the concepts introduced in this book to quickly grasp and understand an unfamiliar AM process by comparing its similarities, beneﬁts,drawbacks, and processing characteristics to the other processes in the groupinginto which it falls. This classiﬁcation scheme from the ﬁrst edition of this textbook had an impor- tant impact on the development and adoption of ASTM/ISO standard terminology.The authors were involved in these consensus standards activities and we haveagreed to adopt the modiﬁed terminology from ASTM F42 and ISO TC 261 in the second edition. Of course, in the future, we will continue to support the ASTM/ISO standardization efforts and keep the textbook up to date. The seven process categories are presented here. Chapters 4–10cover each one in detail: Vat photopolymerization: processes that utilize a liquid photopolymer that is contained in a vat and processed by selectively delivering energy to cure speciﬁcregions of a part cross-section. Powder bed fusion: processes that utilize a container ﬁlled with powder that is processed selectively using an energy source, most commonly a scanning laseror electron beam. Material extrusion: processes that deposit a material by extruding it through a nozzle, typically while scanning the nozzle in a pattern that produces a partcross-section. Material jetting: ink-jet printing processes.• Binder jetting: processes where a binder is printed into a powder bed in order to form part cross-sections. Sheet lamination: processes that deposit a layer of material at a time, where the material is in sheet form. Directed energy deposition: processes that simultaneously deposit a material (usually powder or wire) and provide energy to process that material through asingle deposition device. 2.7 Metal Systems One of the most important recent developments in AM has been the proliferation ofdirect metal processes. Machines like the EOSint-M [ 21] and Laser-Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) have been around for a number of years [ 30,31]. Recent additions from other companies and improvements in laser technology, machine accuracy,speed, and cost have opened up this market. Most direct metal systems work using a point-wise method and nearly all of them utilize metal powders as input. The main exception to this approach is thesheet lamination processes, particularly the Ultrasonic Consolidation process from2.7 Metal Systems 35the Solidica, USA, which uses sheet metal laminates that are ultrasonically welded together [ 32]. Of the powder systems, almost every newer machine uses a powder spreading approach similar to the SLS process, followed by melting using an energy beam. This energy is normally a high-power laser, except in the case of the Electron Beam Melting (EBM) process by the Swedish company Arcam [ 33]. Another approach is the LENS powder delivery system used by Optomec [ 31]. This machine employs powder delivery through a nozzle placed above the part. The powder ismelted where the material converges with the laser and the substrate. This approachallows the process to be used to add material to an existing part, which means it canbe used for repair of expensive metal components that may have been damaged,like chipped turbine blades and injection mold tool inserts. 2.8 Hybrid Systems Some of the machines described above are, in fact, hybrid additive/subtractiveprocesses rather than purely additive. Including a subtractive component can assistin making the process more precise. An example is the use of planar milling at theend of each additive layer in the Sanders and Objet machines. This stage makes for a smooth planar surface onto which the next layer can be added, negating cumula- tive effects from errors in droplet deposition height. It should be noted that when subtractive methods are used, waste will be generated. Machining processes require removal of material that in general cannoteasily be recycled. Similarly, many additive processes require the use of supportstructures and these too must be removed or “subtracted.” It can be said that with the Objet process, for instance, the additive element is dominant and that the subtractive component is important but relatively insigniﬁ- cant. There have been a number of attempts to merge subtractive and additive technologies together where the subtractive component is the dominant element.An excellent example of this is the Stratoconception approach [ 34], where the original CAD models are divided into thick machinable layers. Once these layersare machined, they are bonded together to form the complete solid part. Thisapproach works very well for very large parts that may have features that wouldbe difﬁcult to machine using a multi-axis machining center due to the accessibilityof the tool. This approach can be applied to foam and wood-based materials or to metals. For structural components it is important to consider the bonding methods. For high strength metal parts diffusion bonding may be an alternative. A lower cost solution that works in a similar way is Subtractive RP (SRP) from Roland [ 35], who is also famous for plotter technology. SRP makes use of Roland desktop milling machines to machine sheets of material that can be sandwichedtogether, similar to Stratoconception. The key is to use the exterior material as aframe that can be used to register each slice to others and to hold the part in place.With this method not all the material is machined away and a web of connecting spars are used to maintain this registration.36 2 Development of Additive Manufacturing TechnologyAnother variation of this method that was never commercialized was Shaped Deposition Manufacturing (SDM), developed mainly at Stanford and Carnegie-Mellon Universities in the USA [ 36]. With SDM, the geometry of the part is devolved into a sequence of easier to manufacture parts that can in some way be combined together. A decision is made concerning whether each subpart should bemanufactured using additive or subtractive technology dependent on such factors asthe accuracy, material, geometrical features, functional requirements, etc. Further-more, parts can be made from multiple materials, combined together using a varietyof processes, including the use of plastics, metals and even ceramics. Some of thematerials can also be used in a sacriﬁcial way to create cavities and clearances.Additionally, the “layers” are not necessarily planar, nor constant in thickness. Such a system would be unwieldy and difﬁcult to realize commercially, but the ideas generated during this research have inﬂuenced many studies and systems thereafter. In this book, for technologies where both additive and subtractive approaches are used, these technologies are discussed in the chapter where their additiveapproach best ﬁts. 2.9 Milestones in AM Development We can look at the historical development of AM in a variety of different ways. Theorigins may be difﬁcult to properly deﬁne and there was certainly quite a lot ofactivity in the 1950s and 1960s, but development of the associated technology(computers, lasers, controllers, etc.) caught up with the concept in the early 1980s.Interestingly, parallel patents were ﬁled in 1984 in Japan (Murutani), France (Andreet al.) and in the USA (Masters in July and Hull in August). All of these patentsdescribed a similar concept of fabricating a 3D object by selectively adding material layer by layer. While earlier work in Japan is quite well-documented, proving that this concept could be realized, it was the patent by Charles Hull that isgenerally recognized as the most inﬂuential since it gave rise to 3D Systems. Thiswas the ﬁrst company to commercialize AM technology with the Stereolithographyapparatus (Fig. 2.7). Further patents came along in 1986, resulting in three more companies, Helisys (Laminated Object Manufacture or LOM), Cubital (with Solid Ground Curing,SGC), and DTM with their SLS process. It is interesting to note neither Helisys nor Cubital exist anymore, and only SLS remains as a commercial process with DTM merging with 3D Systems in 2001. In 1989, Scott Crump patented the FDMprocess, forming the Stratasys Company. Also in 1989 a group from MIT patentedthe 3D Printing (3DP) process. These processes from 1989 are heavily used today,with FDM variants currently being the most successful. Rather than forming acompany, the MIT group licensed the 3DP technology to a number of differentcompanies, who applied it in different ways to form the basis for differentapplications of their AM technology. The most successful of these was ZCorp, which focused mainly on low-cost technology.2.9 Milestones in AM Development 37Ink-jet technology has become employed to deposit droplets of material directly onto a substrate, where that material hardens and becomes the part itself rather than just as a binder. Sanders developed this process in 1994 and the Objet Company also used this technique to print photocurable resins in droplet form in 2001. There have been numerous failures and successes in AM history, with the previous paragraphs mentioning only a small number. However, it is interesting to note that some technology may have failed because of poor business models or by poor timing rather than having a poor process. Helisys appears to have failed with their LOM machine, but there have been at least ﬁve variants from Singapore, China, Japan, Israel, and Ireland. The most recent Mcor process laminates colored sheets together rather than the monochrome paper sheets used in the original LOM machine. Perhaps this is a better application and perhaps the technology is in a better position to become successful now compared with the original machines that are over 20 years old. Another example may be the defunct Ballistic Particle Manufacturing process, which used a 5-axis mechanism to direct wax droplets onto a substrate. Although no company currently uses such an approach for polymers, similar 5-axis deposition schemes are being used for depositing metal and composites. Another important trend that is impacting the development of AM technology is the expiration of many of the foundational patents for key AM processes. Already, we are seeing an explosion of material extrusion vendors and systems since the ﬁrst FDM patents expired in the early 2010s. Patents in the stereolithography, laser sintering, and LOM areas are expiring (or have already expired) and may lead to a proliferation of technologies, processes, machines, and companies. Fig. 2.7 The ﬁrst AM technology from Hull, who founded 3D systems (photo courtesy of 3D Systems)38 2 Development of Additive Manufacturing Technology2.10 AM Around the World As was already mentioned, early patents were ﬁled in Europe (France), USA, and Asia (Japan) almost simultaneously. In early years, most pioneering and commer-cially successful systems came out of the USA. Companies like Stratasys, 3D Systems, and ZCorp have spearheaded the way forward. These companies have generally strengthened over the years, but most new companies have come fromoutside the USA. In Europe, the primary company with a world-wide impact in AM is EOS, Germany. EOS stopped making SL machines following settlement of disputeswith 3D Systems but continues to make powder bed fusion systems which uselasers to melt polymers, binder-coated sand, and metals. Companies from France,The Netherlands, Sweden, and other parts of Europe are smaller, but are competi- tive in their respective marketplaces. Examples of these companies include Phenix [37] (now part of 3D Systems), Arcam, Strataconception, and Materialise. The last of these, Materialise from Belgium [ 38], has seen considerable success in develop- ing software tools to support AM technology. In the early 1980s and 1990s, a number of Japanese companies focused on AM technology. This included startup companies like Autostrade (which no longerappears to be operating). Large companies like Sony and Kira, who establishedsubsidiaries to build AM technology, also became involved. Much of the Japanese technology was based around the photopolymer curing processes. With 3D Systems dominant in much of the rest of the world, these Japanese companies struggled toﬁnd market and many of them failed to become commercially viable, even thoughtheir technology showed some initial promise. Some of this demise may haveresulted in the unusually slow uptake of CAD technology within Japanese industryin general. Although the Japanese company CMET [ 39] still seems to be doing quite well, you will likely ﬁnd more non-Japanese made machines in Japan thanhome-grown ones. There is some indication however that this is starting to change. AM technology has also been developed in other parts of Asia, most notably in Korea and China. Korean AM companies are relatively new and it remains to beseen whether they will make an impact. There are, however, quite a few Chinesemanufacturers who have been active for a number of years. Patent conﬂicts with theearlier USA, Japanese, and European designs have meant that not many of thesemachines can be found outside of China. Earlier Chinese machines were alsothought to be of questionable quality, but more recent machines have markedlyimproved performance (like the machine shown in Fig. 2.8). Chinese machines primarily reﬂect the SL, FDM, and SLS technologies found elsewhere in the world. A particular country of interest in terms of AM technology development is Israel. One of the earliest AM machines was developed by the Israeli companyCubital. Although this technology was not a commercial success, in spite of earlyinstallations around the world, they demonstrated a number of innovations notfound in other machines, including layer processing through a mask, removablesecondary support materials and milling after each layer to maintain a constantlayer thickness. Some of the concepts used in Cubital can be found in Sanders2.10 AM Around the World 39machines as well as machines from another Israeli company, Objet. Although one of the newer companies, Objet (now Stratasys) is successfully using droplet depo- sition technology to deposit photocurable resins. 2.11 The Future? Rapid Prototyping Develops into Direct Digital Manufacturing How might the future of AM look? The ability to “grow” parts may form the core to the answer to that question. The true beneﬁt behind AM is the fact that we do not really need to design the part according to how it is to be manufactured. We would prefer to design the part to perform a particular function. Avoiding the need to consider how the part can be manufactured certainly simpliﬁes the process of design and allows the designer to focus more on the intended application. The design ﬂexibility of AM is making this more and more possible. An example of geometric ﬂexibility is customization of a product. If a product is speciﬁcally designed to suit the needs of a unique individual then it can truly be said to be customized. Imagine being able to modify your mobile phone so that it ﬁts snugly into your hand based on the dimensions gathered directly from your hand. Imagine a hearing aid that can ﬁt precisely inside your ear because it was made from an impression of your ear canal (like those shown in Fig. 2.9). Such things are possible using AM because it has the capacity to make one-off parts, directly from digital models that may not only include geometric features but may also include biometric data gathered from a speciﬁc individual. With improvements in AM technology the speed, quality, accuracy, and material properties have all developed to the extent that parts can be made for ﬁnal use and not just for prototyping. The terms Rapid Manufacturing and Direct Digital Fig. 2.8 AM technology from Beijing Yinhua Co. Ltd., China40 2 Development of Additive Manufacturing TechnologyManufacturing (RM and DDM) have gained popularity to represent the use of AM to produce parts which will be used as an end-product. Certainly we will continue to use this technology for prototyping for years to come, but we are already entering a time when it is commonplace to manufacture products in low volumes or unique products using AM. Eventually we may see these machines being used as home fabrication devices. 2.12 Exercises (a) Based upon an Internet search, describe the Solid Ground Curing process developed by Cubital. (b) Solid Ground Curing has been described as a 2D channel (layer) technique. Could it also be described in another category? Why? Make a list of the different metal AM technologies that are currently available on the market today. How can you distinguish between the different systems? What different materials can be processed in these machines? NC machining is often referred to as a 2.5D process. What does this mean? Why might it not be regarded as fully 3D? Provide three instances where a layer-based approach has been used in fabrica- tion, other than AM. Find ﬁve countries where AM technology has been developed commercially and describe the machines. Consider what a fabrication system in the home might look like, with the ability to manufacture many of the products around the house. How do you think this could be implemented?

Easy-to-use “personal” 3D printing machines emphasize the simplicity of this task sequence. These desktop-sized machines are characterized by their low cost, simplicity of use, andability to be placed in a home or ofﬁce environment. The larger and more “indus-trial” AM machines are more capable of being tuned to suit different userrequirements and therefore require more expertise to operate, but with a widervariety of possible results and effects that may be put to good use by an experiencedoperator. Such machines also usually require more careful installation in industrialenvironments. This chapter will take the reader through the different stages of the process that were described in Chap. 1. Where possible, the different steps in the process will be described with reference to different processes and machines. The objective is toallow the reader to understand how these machines may differ and also to see howeach task works and how it may be exploited to the beneﬁt of higher quality results.As mentioned before, we will refer to eight key steps in the process sequence:  Conceptualization and CAD  Conversion to STL/AMF  Transfer and manipulation of STL/AMF ﬁle on AM machine Machine setup Build Part removal and cleanup Post-processing of part Application There are other ways to breakdown this process ﬂow, depending on your perspective and equipment familiarity. For example, if you are a designer, you #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_343may see more stages in the early product design aspects. Model makers may see more steps in the post-build part of the process. Different AM technologies handlethis process sequence differently, so this chapter will also discuss how choice of machine affects the generic process. The use of AM in place of conventional manufacturing processes, such as machining and injection molding, enables designers to ignore some of theconstraints of conventional manufacturing. However, conventional manufacturingwill remain core to how many products are manufactured. Thus, we must alsounderstand how conventional technologies, such as machining, integrate withAM. This may be particularly relevant to the increasingly popular metal AMprocesses. Thus, we will discuss how to deal with metal systems in detail. 3.2 The Eight Steps in Additive Manufacture The above-mentioned sequence of steps is generally appropriate to all AMtechnologies. There will be some variations dependent on which technology isbeing used and also on the design of the particular part. Some steps can be quiteinvolved for some machines but may be trivial for others. 3.2.1 Step 1: Conceptualization and CAD The ﬁrst step in any product development process is to come up with an idea forhow the product will look and function. Conceptualization can take many forms,from textual and narrative descriptions to sketches and representative models. IfAM is to be used, the product description must be in a digital form that allows aphysical model to be made. It may be that AM technology will be used to prototypeand not build the ﬁnal product, but in either case, there are many stages in a productdevelopment process where digital models are required. AM technology would not exist if it were not for 3D CAD. Only after we gained the ability to represent solid objects in computers were we able to develop technol- ogy to physically reproduce such objects. Initially, this was the principlesurrounding CNC machining technology in general. AM can thus be described asa direct or streamlined Computer Aided Design to Computer Aided Manufacturing(CAD/CAM) process. Unlike most other CAD/CAM technologies, there is little orno intervention between the design and manufacturing stages for AM. The generic AM process must therefore start with 3D CAD information, as shown in Fig. 3.1. There may be a variety of ways for how the 3D source data can be created. This model description could be generated by a design expert via a user- interface, by software as part of an automated optimization algorithm, by 3Dscanning of an existing physical part, or some combination of all of these. Most3D CAD systems are solid modeling systems with surface modeling components;solid models are often constructed by combining surfaces together or by addingthickness to a surface. In the past, 3D CAD modeling software had difﬁculty44 3 Generalized Additive Manufacturing Process Chaincreating fully enclosed solid models, and often models would appear to the casual observer to be enclosed but in fact were not mathematically closed. Such models could result in unpredictable output from AM machines, with different AMtechnologies treating gaps in different ways. Most modern solid modeling CAD tools can now create ﬁles without gaps (e.g., “water tight”), resulting in geometrically unambiguous representations of a part.Most CAD packages treat surfaces as construction tools that are used to act on solidmodels, and this has the effect of maintaining the integrity of the solid data.Provided it can ﬁt inside the machine, typically any CAD model can be made using AM technology without too many difﬁculties. However, there still remain some older or poorly developed 3D CAD software that may result in solids that arenot fully enclosed and produce unreliable AM output. Problems of this manner arenormally detected once the CAD model has been converted into the STL format forbuilding using AM technology. 3.2.2 Step 2: Conversion to STL/AMF Nearly every AM technology uses the STL ﬁle format. The term STL was derivedfrom STereoLithograhy, which was the ﬁrst commercial AM technology from 3D Fig. 3.1 The eight stages of the AM process3.2 The Eight Steps in Additive Manufacture 45Systems in the 1990s. Considered a de facto standard, STL is a simple way of describing a CAD model in terms of its geometry alone. It works by removing anyconstruction data, modeling history, etc., and approximating the surfaces of the model with a series of triangular facets. The minimum size of these triangles can be set within most CAD software and the objective is to ensure the models created donot show any obvious triangles on the surface. The triangle size is in fact calculatedin terms of the minimum distance between the plane represented by the triangle andthe surface it is supposed to represent. In other words, a basic rule of thumb is toensure that the minimum triangle offset is smaller than the resolution of the AMmachine. The process of converting to STL is automatic within most CAD systems,but there is a possibility of errors occurring during this phase. There have therefore been a number of software tools developed to detect such errors and to rectify them if possible. STL ﬁles are an unordered collection of triangle vertices and surface normal vectors. As such, an STL ﬁle has no units, color, material, or other featureinformation. These limitations of an STL ﬁle have led to the recent adoption of anew “AMF” ﬁle format. This format is now an international ASTM/ISO standardformat which extends the STL format to include dimensions, color, material, andmany other useful features. As of the writing of this book, several major CAD companies and AM hardware vendors had publically announced that they will be supporting AMF in their next generation software. Thus, although the term STL isused throughout the remainder of this textbook, the AMF ﬁle could be simplysubstituted wherever STL appears, as the AMF format has all of the beneﬁts of theSTL ﬁle format with many fewer limitations. STL ﬁle repair software, like the MAGICS software from the Belgian company Materialise [ 1], is used when there are problems with the STL ﬁle that may prevent the part from being built correctly. With complex geometries, it may be difﬁcult for a human to detect such problems when inspecting the CAD or the subsequently generated STL data. If the errors are small then they may even go unnoticed untilafter the part has been built. Such software may therefore be applied as a checkingstage to ensure that there are no problems with the STL ﬁle data before the build isperformed. Since STL is essentially a surface description, the corresponding triangles in the ﬁles must be pointing in the correct direction; in other words, the surface normalvector associated with the triangle must indicate which side of the triangle is outside vs. inside the part. The cross-section that corresponds to the part layers of a region near an inverted normal vector may therefore be the inversion of what is desired.Additionally, complex and highly discontinuous geometry may result in trianglevertices that do not align correctly. This may result in gaps in the surface. VariousAM technologies may react to these problems in different ways. Some machinesmay process the STL data in such a way that the gaps are bridged. This bridge maynot represent the desired surface, however, and it may be possible that additional,unwanted material may be included in the part. While most errors can be detected and rectiﬁed automatically, there may also be a requirement for manual intervention. Software should therefore highlight the46 3 Generalized Additive Manufacturing Process Chainproblem, indicating what is thought to be inverted triangles for instance. Since geometries can become very complex, it may be difﬁcult for the software toestablish whether the result is in fact an error or something that was part of the original design intent. 3.2.3 Step 3: Transfer to AM Machine and STL File Manipulation Once the STL ﬁle has been created and repaired, it can be sent directly to the target AM machine. Ideally, it should be possible to press a “print” button and themachine should build the part straight away. This is not usually the case howeverand there may be a number of actions required prior to building the part. The ﬁrst task would be to verify that the part is correct. AM system software normally has a visualization tool that allows the user to view and manipulate thepart. The user may wish to reposition the part or even change the orientation toallow it to be built at a speciﬁc location within the machine. It is quite common to build more than one part in an AM machine at a time. This may be multiples of the same part (thus requiring a copy function) or completely different STL ﬁles. STLﬁles can be linearly scaled quite easily. Some applications may require the AM partto be slightly larger or slightly smaller than the original to account for processshrinkage or coatings; and so scaling may be required prior to building.Applications may also require that the part be identiﬁed in some way and somesoftware tools have been developed to add text and simple features to STLformatted data for this purpose. This would be done in the form of adding 3D embossed characters. More unusual cases may even require segmentation of STL ﬁles (e.g., for parts that may be too large) or even merging of multiple STL ﬁles. Itshould be noted that not all AM machines will have all the functions mentionedhere, but numerous STL ﬁle manipulation software tools are available for purchaseor, in some cases, for free download to perform these functions prior to sending theﬁle to a machine. 3.2.4 Step 4: Machine Setup All AM machines will have at least some setup parameters that are speciﬁc to thatmachine or process. Some machines are only designed to run a few speciﬁcmaterials and give the user few options to vary layer thickness or other build parameters. These types of machines will have very few setup changes to make from build to build. Other machines are designed to run with a variety of materialsand may also have some parameters that require optimization to suit the type of partthat is to be built, or permit parts to be built quicker but with poorer resolution. Suchmachines can have numerous setup options available. It is common in the morecomplex cases to have default settings or save ﬁles from previously deﬁned setupsto help speed up the machine setup process and to prevent mistakes being made.3.2 The Eight Steps in Additive Manufacture 47Normally, an incorrect setup procedure will still result in a part being built. The ﬁnal quality of that part may, however, be unacceptable. In addition to setting up machine software parameters, most machines must be physically prepared for a build. The operator must check to make sure sufﬁcient build material is loaded into the machine to complete the build. For machines whichuse powder, the powder is often sifted and subsequently loaded and leveled in themachine as part of the setup operation. For processes which utilize a build plate, theplate must be inserted and leveled with respect to the machine axes. Some of thesemachine setup operations are automated as part of the start-up of a build, but formost machines these operations are done manually by a trained operator. 3.2.5 Step 5: Build Although beneﬁtting from the assistance of computers, the ﬁrst few stages of theAM process are semiautomated tasks that may require considerable manual control,interaction, and decision making. Once these steps are completed, the processswitches to the computer-controlled building phase. This is where the previouslymentioned layer-based manufacturing takes place. All AM machines will have asimilar sequence of layering, including a height adjustable platform or depositionhead, material deposition/spreading mechanisms, and layer cross-section forma- tion. Some machines will combine the material deposition and layer formation simultaneously while others will separate them. As long as no errors are detectedduring the build, AM machines will repeat the layering process until the build iscomplete. 3.2.6 Step 6: Removal and Cleanup Ideally, the output from the AM machine should be ready for use with minimalmanual intervention. While sometimes this may be the case, more often than not, parts will require a signiﬁcant amount of post-processing before they are ready for use. In all cases, the part must be either separated from a build platform on whichthe part was produced or removed from excess build material surrounding the part.Some AM processes use additional material other than that used to make the partitself (secondary support materials). Later chapters describe how various AMprocesses need these support structures to help keep the part from collapsing orwarping during the build process. At this stage, it is not necessary to understandexactly how support structures work, but it is necessary to know that they need to be dealt with. While some processes have been developed to produce easy-to-remove supports, there is often a signiﬁcant amount of manual work required at this stage.For metal supports, a wire EDM machine, bandsaw, and/or milling equipment maybe required to remove the part from the baseplate and the supports from the part.There is a degree of operator skill required in part removal, since mishandling ofparts and poor technique can result in damage to the part. Different AM parts have48 3 Generalized Additive Manufacturing Process Chaindifferent cleanup requirements, but sufﬁce it to say that all processes have some requirement at this stage. The cleanup stage may also be considered as the initialpart of the post-processing stage. 3.2.7 Step 7: Post-Processing Post-processing refers to the (usually manual) stages of ﬁnishing the parts forapplication purposes. This may involve abrasive ﬁnishing, like polishing andsandpapering, or application of coatings. This stage in the process is very applica- tion speciﬁc. Some applications may only require a minimum of post-processing. Other applications may require very careful handling of the parts to maintain goodprecision and ﬁnish. Some post-processing may involve chemical or thermaltreatment of the part to achieve ﬁnal part properties. Different AM processeshave different results in terms of accuracy, and thus machining to ﬁnal dimensionsmay be required. Some processes produce relatively fragile components that mayrequire the use of inﬁltration and/or surface coatings to strengthen the ﬁnal part. Asalready stated, this is often a manually intensive task due to the complexity of most AM parts. However, some of the tasks can beneﬁt from the use of power tools, CNC milling, and additional equipment, like polishing tubs or drying and baking ovens. 3.2.8 Step 8: Application Following post-processing, parts are ready for use. It should be noted that, although parts may be made from similar materials to those available from other manufacturing processes (like molding and casting), parts may not behaveaccording to standard material speciﬁcations. Some AM processes inherently createparts with small voids trapped inside them, which could be the source for partfailure under mechanical stress. In addition, some processes may cause the materialto degrade during build or for materials not to bond, link, or crystallize in anoptimum way. In almost every case, the properties are anisotropic (differentproperties in different direction). For most metal AM processes, rapid cooling results in different microstructures than those from conventional manufacturing. As a result, AM produced parts behave differently than parts made using a moreconventional manufacturing approach. This behavior may be better or worse for aparticular application, and thus a designer should be aware of these differences andtake them into account during the design stage. AM materials and processes areimproving rapidly, and thus designers must be aware of recent advancements inmaterials and processes to best determine how to use AM for their needs.3.2 The Eight Steps in Additive Manufacture 493.3 Variations from One AM Machine to Another The above generic process steps can be applied to every commercial AM technol- ogy. As has been noted, different technologies may require more or less attentionfor a number of these stages. Here we discuss the implications of these variations, not only from process to process but also in some cases within a speciﬁc technology. The nominal layer thickness for most machines is around 0.1 mm. However, it should be noted that this is just a rule of thumb. For example, the layer thickness forsome material extrusion machines is 0.254 mm, whereas layer thicknesses between0.05 and 0.1 mm are commonly used for vat photopolymerization processes, andsmall intricate parts made for investment casting using material jetting technologymay have layer thicknesses of 0.01 mm. Many technologies have the capacity to vary the layer thickness. The reasoning is that thicker layer parts are quicker to build but are less precise. This may not be a problem for some applications where itmay be more important to make the parts as quickly as possible. Fine detail in a design may cause problems with some AM technologies, such as wall thickness, particularly if there is no choice but to build the part vertically. Thisis because even though positioning within the machine may be very precise, there isa ﬁnite dimension to the droplet size, laser diameter, or extrusion head thatessentially deﬁnes the ﬁnest detail or thinnest wall that can be fabricated. There are other factors that may not only affect the choice of process but also inﬂuence some of the steps in the process chain. In particular, the use of differentmaterials even within the same process may affect the time, resources, and skillrequired to carry out a stage. For example, the use of water soluble supports inmaterial extrusion processes may require specialist equipment but will also providebetter ﬁnish to parts with less hand ﬁnishing required than when using conventionalsupports. Alternatively, some polymers require special attention, like the use(or avoidance) of particular solvents or inﬁltration compounds. A number of processes beneﬁt from application of sealants or even inﬁltration of liquid polymers. These materials must be compatible with the part material both chemi-cally and mechanically. Post-processing that involves heat must include awarenessof the heat resistance or melting temperature of the materials involved. Abrasive ormachining-based processing must also require knowledge of the mechanicalproperties of the materials involved. If considerable ﬁnishing is required, it mayalso be necessary to include an allowance in the part geometry, perhaps by usingscaling of the STL ﬁle or offsetting of the part’s surfaces, so that the part does not become worn away too much. Variations between AM technologies will become clariﬁed further in the fol- lowing chapters, but a general understanding can be achieved by consideringwhether the build material is processed as a powder, molten material, solid sheet,vat of liquid photopolymer, or ink-jet deposited photopolymer.50 3 Generalized Additive Manufacturing Process Chain3.3.1 Photopolymer-Based Systems It is quite easy to set up systems which utilize photopolymers as the build material. Photopolymer-based systems, however, require ﬁles to be created which represent the support structures. All liquid vat systems must use supports from essentially the same material as that used for the part. For material jetting systems it is possible touse a secondary support material from parallel ink-jet print heads so that thesupports will come off easier. An advantage of photopolymer systems is thataccuracy is generally very good, with thin layers and ﬁne precision where requiredcompared with other systems. Photopolymers have historically had poor materialproperties when compared with many other AM materials, however newer resinshave been developed that offer improved temperature resistance, strength, and ductility. The main drawback of photopolymer materials is that degradation can occur quite rapidly if UV protective coatings are not applied. 3.3.2 Powder-Based Systems There is no need to use supports for powder systems which deposit a bed of powderlayer-by-layer (with the exception of supports for metal systems, as addressedbelow). Thus, powder bed-based systems are among the easiest to set up for asimple build. Parts made using binder jetting into a powder bed can be colored byusing colored binder material. If color is used then coding the ﬁle may take a longertime, as standard STL data does not include color. There are, however, other ﬁleformats based around VRML that allow colored geometries to be built, in addition to AMF. Powder bed fusion processes have a signiﬁcant amount of unused powder in every build that has been subjected to some level of thermal history. This thermalhistory may cause changes in the powder. Thus, a well-designed recycling strategybased upon one of several proven methods can help ensure that the material beingused is within appropriate limits to guarantee good builds [ 2]. It is also important to understand the way powders behave inside a machine. For example, some machines use powder feed chambers at either side of the buildplatform. The powder at the top of these chambers is likely to be less dense than the powder at the bottom, which will have been compressed under the weight of the powder on top. This in turn may affect the amount of material deposited at eachlayer and density of the ﬁnal part built in the machine. For very tall builds, this maybe a particular problem that can be solved by carefully compacting the powder inthe feed chambers before starting the machine and also by adjusting temperaturesand powder feed settings during the build. 3.3.3 Molten Material Systems Systems which melt and deposit material in a molten state require supportstructures. For droplet-based systems like with the Thermojet process these3.3 Variations from One AM Machine to Another 51supports are automatically generated; but with material extrusion processes or directed energy deposition systems supports can either be generated automaticallyor the user can use some ﬂexibility to change how supports are made. With water soluble supports it is not too important where the supports go, but with breakaway support systems made from the same material as the build material, it is worthwhileto check where the supports go, as surface damage to the part will occur to someextent where these supports were attached before breaking them away. Also, ﬁllpatterns for material extrusion may require some attention, based upon the designintent. Parts can be easily made using default settings, but there may be somebeneﬁt in changing aspects of the build sequence if a part or region of a part requiresspeciﬁc characteristics. For example, there are typically small voids in FDM parts that can be minimized by increasing the amount of material extruded in a particular region. This will minimize voids, but at the expenses of part accuracy. Althoughwax parts made using material jetting are good for reproducing ﬁne features, theyare difﬁcult to handle because of their low strength and brittleness. ABS parts madeusing material extrusion, on the other hand, are among the strongest AM polymerparts available, but when they are desired as a functional end-use part, this maymean they need substantial ﬁnishing compared with other processes as they exhibitlower accuracy than some other AM technologies. 3.3.4 Solid Sheets With sheet lamination methods where the sheets are ﬁrst placed and then cut, thereis no need for supports. Instead, there is a need to process the waste material in sucha way that it can be removed from the part. This is generally a straightforward automated process but there may be a need for close attention to ﬁne detail within a part. Cleaning up the parts can be the most laborious process and there is a generalneed to know exactly what the ﬁnal part is supposed to look like so that damage isnot caused to the part during the waste removal stage. The paper-based systemsexperienced problems with handling should they not be carefully and comprehen-sively ﬁnished using sealants and coatings. For polymer sheet lamination, the partsare typically not as sensitive to damage. For metal sheet lamination processes,typically the sheets are cut ﬁrst and then stacked to form the 3D shape, and thus support removal becomes unnecessary. 3.4 Metal Systems As previously mentioned, operation of metal-based AM systems is conceptually similar to polymer systems. However, the following points are worth considering.52 3 Generalized Additive Manufacturing Process Chain3.4.1 The Use of Substrates Most metal systems make use of a base platform or substrate onto which parts are built and from which they must be removed using machining, wire cutting, or a similar method. The need to attach the parts to a base platform is mainly because of the high-temperature gradients between the temporarily molten material and itssurroundings, resulting in large residual stress. If the material was not rigidlyattached to a solid platform then there would be a tendency for the part to warpas it cools, which means further layers of powder could not be spread evenly overtop. Therefore, even though these processes may build within a powder bed, there isstill a need for supports. 3.4.2 Energy Density The energy density required to melt metals is obviously much higher than formelting polymers. The high temperatures achieved during metal melting mayrequire more stringent heat shielding, insulation, temperature control, and atmo-spheric control than for polymer systems. 3.4.3 Weight Metal powder systems may process lightweight titanium powders but they alsoprocess high-density tool steels. The powder handling technology must be capableof withstanding the mass of these materials. This means that power requirements for positioning and handling equipment must be quite substantial or gear ratios must be high (and corresponding travel speeds lower) to deal with these tasks. 3.4.4 Accuracy Metal powder systems are generally at least as accurate as corresponding polymer powder systems. Surface ﬁnish is characteristically grainy but part density and part accuracy are very good. Surface roughness is on the order of a few tens to a fewhundreds of microns depending on the process, and can be likened in generalappearance to precision casting technology. For metal parts, this is often notsatisfactory and at least some shot-peening is required to smooth the surface. Keymating features on metal parts often require surface machining or grinding. The partdensity will be high (generally over 99 %), although some voids may still be seen.3.4 Metal Systems 533.4.5 Speed Since there are heavy requirements on the amount of energy to melt the powder particles and to handle the powders within the machine, the build speed of metal systems is generally slower than a comparable polymer system. Laser powers are usually just a few 100 W (polymer systems start at around 50 W of laser power).This means that the laser scanning speed is lower than for polymer systems, toensure enough energy is delivered to the powder. 3.5 Maintenance of Equipment While numerous stages in the AM process have been discussed, it is important torealize that many machines require careful maintenance. Some machines usesensitive laser or printer technology that must be carefully monitored and thatshould preferably not be used in a dirty or noisy (both electrical noise and mechani-cal vibration) environment. Similarly, many of the feed materials require careful handling and should be used in low humidity conditions. While machines are designed to operate unattended, it is important to include regular checks in themaintenance schedule. Many machine vendors recommend and provide testpatterns that should be used periodically to conﬁrm that the machines are operatingwithin acceptable limits. Laser-based systems are generally expensive because of the cost of the laser and scanner system. Furthermore, maintenance of a laser can be very expensive,particularly for lasers with limited lifetimes. Printheads are also components that have ﬁnite lifetimes for material jetting and binder jetting systems. The ﬁne nozzle dimensions and the use of relatively high viscosity ﬂuids mean they are prone toclogging and contamination effects. Replacement costs are, however, generallyquite low. 3.6 Materials Handling Issues In addition to the machinery, AM materials often require careful handling. The rawmaterials used in some AM processes have limited shelf-life and must also be keptin conditions that prevent them from chemical reaction or degradation. Exposure tomoisture and to excess light should be avoided. Most processes use materials thatcan be used for more than one build. However, it may be that this could degrade thematerial if used many times over and therefore a procedure for maintaining consistent material quality through recycling should also be observed. While there are some health concerns with extended exposure to some photo- polymer resins, most AM polymer raw materials are safe to handle. Powdermaterials may in general be medically inert, but excess amounts of powder canmake the workplace slippery, contaminate mechanisms, and create a breathinghazard. In addition, reactive powders can be a ﬁre hazard. These issues may54 3 Generalized Additive Manufacturing Process Chaincause problems if machines are to be used in a design center environment rather than in a workshop. AM system vendors have spent considerable effort to simplifyand facilitate material handling. Loading new materials is often a procedure that can be done ofﬂine or with minimal changeover time so that machines can run continuously. Software systems are often tuned to the materials so that they canrecognize different materials and adjust build parameters accordingly. Many materials are carefully tuned to work with a speciﬁc AM technology. There are often warranty issues surrounding the use of third party materials thatusers should be aware of. For example, some polymer laser sintering powders mayhave additives that prevent degradation due to oxidation since they are kept atelevated temperatures for long periods of time. Also, material extrusion ﬁlaments need a very tight diametric tolerance not normally available from conventional extruders. Since a material extrusion drive pushes the ﬁlament through the machine,variations in diameter may cause slippage. Furthermore, build parameters aredesigned around the standard materials used. Since there are huge numbers ofmaterial formulations, changing one material for another, even though they appearto be the same, may require careful build setup and process parameter optimization. Some machines allow the user to recycle some or all of the material used in a machine but not consumed during the build of a prior part. This is particularly true with the powder-based systems. Also photopolymer resins can be reused. However, there may be artifacts and other contaminants in the recycled materials and it isimportant to carefully inspect, sift, or sieve the material before returning it to themachine. Many laser sintering builds have been spoiled, for example, by hairs thathave come off a paintbrush used to clean the parts from a previous build. 3.7 Design for AM Designers and operators should consider a number of build-related factors whenconsidering the setup of an AM machine, including the following sections. This is abrief introduction, but more information can be found in Chap. 17. 3.7.1 Part Orientation If a cylinder was built on its end, then it would consist of a series of circular layers built on top of each other. Although layer edges may not be precisely vertical for all AM processes, the result would normally be a very well-deﬁned cylinder with a relatively smooth edge. The same cylinder built on its side will have distinct layerstair-step patterning on the sides. This will result in less accurate reproduction of theoriginal CAD data with a poorer aesthetic appearance. Additionally, as the layeringprocess for most AM machines takes additional time, a long cylinder built verticallywill take more time to build than if it is laid horizontally. For material extrusionprocesses, however, the time to build a part is solely a factor of the total build3.7 Design for AM 55volume (including supports) and thus a cylinder should always be built vertically if possible. Orientation of the part within the machine can affect part accuracy. Since many parts will have complex features along multiple axes, there may not be an ideal orientation for a particular part. Furthermore, it may be more important to maintainthe geometry of some features when compared with others, so correct orientationmay be a judgment call. This judgment may also be in contrast with other factorslike the time it takes to build a part (e.g., taller builds take longer than shorter onesso high aspect ratio parts may be better built lying down), whether a certainorientation will generate more supports, or whether certain surfaces should bebuilt face-up to ensure good surface ﬁnish in areas that are not in contact with support structures. In general upward-facing features in AM have the best quality. The reason for this depends upon the process. For instance, upward-facing features are not incontact with the supports required for many processes. For powder beds, theupward-facing features are smooth since they solidify against air, whereasdownward-facing and sideways-facing features solidify against powder and thushave a powdery texture. For extrusion processes, upward-facing surfaces aresmoothed by the extrusion tip. Thus, this upward-facing feature quality rule is one of the few rules-of-thumb that are generically applicable to every AM process. 3.7.2 Removal of Supports For those technologies that require supports, it is a good idea to try and minimize the amount. Wherever the supports meet the part there will be small marks and reducing the amount of supports would reduce the amount of part cleanup and post- process ﬁnishing. However, as mentioned above, some surfaces may not be asimportant as others and so positioning of the part must be weighed against therelative importance of an affected surface. In addition, removal of too manysupports may mean that the part becomes detached from the baseplate and willmove around during subsequent layering. If distortion causes a part to extend in thez direction enough that it hits the layering mechanism (such as a powder-spreadingblade) then the build will fail. Parts that require supports may also require planning for their removal. Supports may be located in difﬁcult-to-reach regions within the part. For example, a hollowcylinder with end caps built vertically will require supports for the top surface.However, if there is no access hole then these supports cannot be removed.Inclusion of access holes (which could be plugged later) is a possible solution tothis, as may be breaking up the part so the supports can be removed beforereassembly. Similarly, parts made using vat photopolymerization processes mayrequire drain holes for any trapped liquid resin.56 3 Generalized Additive Manufacturing Process Chain3.7.3 Hollowing Out Parts Parts that have thick walls may be designed to include hollow features if this does not reduce the part’s functionality. The main beneﬁts of doing this are the reduced build time, the reduced cost from the use of less material, and the reduced mass in the ﬁnal component. As mentioned previously, some liquid-based resin systemswould require drain holes to remove excess resin from inside the part, and the sameis true for powder. A honeycomb- or truss-like internal structure can assist inproviding support and strength within a part, while reducing its overall mass andvolume. All of these approaches must be balanced against the additional time that itwould take to design such a part. However, there are software systems that wouldallow this to be done automatically for certain types of parts. 3.7.4 Inclusion of Undercuts and Other Manufacturing Constraining Features AM models can be used at various stages of the product development process. When evaluating initial designs, focus may be on the aesthetics or ultimate func-tionality of the part. Consideration of how to include manufacturing-relatedfeatures would have lower priority at this stage. Conventional manufacturingwould require considerable planning to ensure that a part is fabricated correctly.Undercuts, draft angles, holes, pockets, etc. must be created in a speciﬁc order whenusing multiple-stage conventional processes. While this can be ignored whendesigning the part for AM, it is important not to forget them if AM is being used just as a prototype process. AM can be used in the design process to help determine where and what type of rib, boss, and other strengthening approaches should beused on the ﬁnal part. If the ﬁnal part is to be injection molded, the AM part can beused to determine the best location for the parting lines in the mold. 3.7.5 Interlocking Features AM machines have a ﬁnite build volume and large parts may not be capable ofbeing built inside them. A solution may be to break the design up into segments thatcan ﬁt into the machine and manually assemble them together later. The designermust therefore consider the best way to break up the parts. The regions where thebreaks are made can be designed in such a way as to facilitate reassembly.Techniques can include incorporation of interlocking features and maximizing surface area so that adhesives can be most effective. Such regions should also be in easy-to-reach but difﬁcult-to-observe locations. This approach of breaking parts up may be helpful even when they can still ﬁt inside the machine. Consider the design shown in Fig. 3.2. If it was built as a single part, it would take a long time and may require a signiﬁcant amount of supports(as shown in the left-hand ﬁgure). If the part were built as two separate pieces the3.7 Design for AM 57resulting height would be signiﬁcantly reduced and there would be few supports. The part could be glued together later. This glued region may be slightly weakened, but the individual segments may be stronger. Since the example has a thin wall section, the top of the upright band shown in the left side of the ﬁgure will exhibit stair-stepping and may also be weaker than the rest of the part, whereas the part build lying down would typically be stronger. For the bonded region, it is possible to include large overlapping regions that will enable more effective bonding. 3.7.6 Reduction of Part Count in an Assembly There are numerous sections in this book that discuss the use of AM for direct manufacture of parts for end-use applications. The AM process is therefore toward the end of the product development process and the design does not need to consider alternative manufacturing processes. This in turn means that if part assembly can be simpliﬁed using AM, then this should be done. For example, it is possible to build fully assembled hinge structures by providing clearance around the moving features. In addition, complex assemblies made up of multiple injection molded parts, for instance, could be built as a single component. Thus, when producing components with AM, designers should always look for ways to consol- idate multiple parts into a single part and to include additional part complexity where it can improve system performance. Several of the parts in Fig. 1.4provide good examples of these concepts. 3.7.7 Identification Markings/Numbers Although AM parts are often unique, it may be difﬁcult for a company to keep track of them when they are possibly building hundreds of parts per week. It is a straightforward process to include identifying features on the parts. This can be Fig. 3.2 The build on the left(shown with support materials within the arch) can be broken into the two parts on the right , which may be stronger and can be glued together later. Note the reduction in the amount of supports and the reduced build height58 3 Generalized Additive Manufacturing Process Chaindone when designing the CAD model but that may not be possible since the models may come from a third party. There are a number of software systems that providetools for labeling parts by embossing alphanumeric characters onto them as 3D models. In addition, some service providers build all the parts ordered by a particular customer (or small parts which might otherwise get lost) within a meshbox so that they are easy to ﬁnd and identify during part cleanup. 3.8 Application Areas That Don’t Involve Conventional CAD Modeling Additive manufacturing technology opens up opportunities for many applications that do not take the standard product development route. The capability ofintegrating AM with customizing data or data from unusual sources makes forrapid response and an economical solution. The following sections are examples where nonstandard approaches are applicable. 3.8.1 Medical Modeling AM is increasingly used to make parts based on an individual person’s medical data. Such data are based on 3D scanning obtained from systems like ComputerizedTomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), 3D ultrasound, etc. Thesedatasets often need considerable processing to extract the relevant sections before itcan be built as a model or further incorporated into a product design. There are afew software systems that can process medical data in a suitable way, and a range of applications have emerged. For example, Materialise [ 1] developed software used in the production of hearing aids. AM technology helps in customizing thesehearing aids from data that are collected from the ear canals of individual patients. 3.8.2 Reverse Engineering Data Medical data from patients is just one application that beneﬁts from being able tocollect and process complex surface information. For nonmedical data collection,the more common approach is to use laser scanning technology. Such technologyhas the ability to faithfully collect surface data from many types of surfaces that aredifﬁcult to model because they cannot be easily deﬁned geometrically. Similar to medical data, although the models can just be reproduced within the AM machine (like a kind of 3D copy machine), the typical intent is to merge this data into productdesign. Interestingly, laser scanners for reverse engineering and inspection run thegamut from very expensive, very high-quality systems (e.g., from Leica andSteinbichler) to mid-range systems (from Faro and Creaform) to MicrosoftKinect™controllers.3.8 Application Areas That Don’t Involve Conventional CAD Modeling 593.8.3 Architectural Modeling Architectural models are usually created to emphasize certain features within a building design and so designs are modiﬁed to show textures, colors, and shapes that may not be exact reproductions of the ﬁnal design. Therefore, architectural packages may require features that are tuned to the AM technology. 3.9 Further Discussion AM technologies are beginning to move beyond a common set of basic processsteps. In the future we will likely see more processes using variations of the conventional AM approach, and combinations of AM with conventional manufacturing operations. Some technologies are being developed to processregions rather than layers of a part. As a result, more intelligent and complexsoftware systems will be required to effectively deal with segmentation. We can expect processes to become more complex within a single machine. We already see numerous additive processes combined with subtractive elements. Astechnology develops further, we may see commercialization of hybrid technologiesthat include additive, subtractive, and even robotic handling phases in a complex coordinated and controlled fashion. This will require much more attention to software descriptions, but may also lead to highly optimized parts with multiplefunctionality and vastly improved quality with very little manual interventionduring the actual build process. Another trend we are likely to see is the development of customized AM systems. Presently, AM machines are designed to produce as wide a variety ofpossible part geometries with as wide a range of materials as possible. Reduction ofthese variables may result in machines that are designed only to build a subset of parts or materials very efﬁciently or inexpensively. This has already started with the proliferation of “personal” versus “industrial” material extrusion systems. In addi-tion, many machines are being targeted for the dental or hearing aid markets, andsystem manufacturers have redesigned their basic machine architectures and/orsoftware tools to enable rapid setup, building, and post-processing of patient-speciﬁc small parts. Software is increasingly being optimized speciﬁcally for AM processing. Spe- cial software has been designed to increase the efﬁciency of hearing aid design and manufacture. There is also special software designed to convert the designs of World of Warcraft models into “FigurePrints” (see Fig. 3.3) as well as specially designed post-processing techniques [ 3]. As Direct Digital Manufacturing becomes more common, we will see the need to develop standardized software processesbased around AM, so that we can better control, track, regulate, and predict themanufacturing process.60 3 Generalized Additive Manufacturing Process Chain3.9.1 Exercises Investigate some of the web sites associated with different AM technologies. Find out information on how to handle the processes and resulting parts according to the eight stages mentioned in this chapter. What are four different tasks that you would need to carry out using a vat photopolymerization process that you wouldn’t have to do using a binder jetting technology and vice versa?

Most photopolymers react to radia-tion in the ultraviolet (UV) range of wavelengths, but some visible light systemsare used as well. Upon irradiation, these materials undergo a chemical reactionto become solid. This reaction is called photopolymerization, and is typically complex, involving many chemical participants. Photopolymers were developed in the late 1960s and soon became widely applied in several commercial areas, most notably the coating and printingindustry. Many of the glossy coatings on paper and cardboard, for example,are photopolymers. Additionally, photo-curable resins are used in dentistry, suchas for sealing the top surfaces of teeth to ﬁll in deep grooves and prevent cavities.In these applications, coatings are cured by radiation that blankets the resinwithout the need for patterning either the material or the radiation. This changed with the introduction of stereolithography, the ﬁrst vat photopolymerization process. 4.1 Introduction Photopolymerization processes make use of liquid, radiation-curable resins, orphotopolymers, as their primary materials. Most photopolymers react to radiationin the ultraviolet (UV) range of wavelengths, but some visible light systems areused as well. Upon irradiation, these materials undergo a chemical reaction tobecome solid. This reaction is called photopolymerization, and is typically com-plex, involving many chemical participants. Photopolymers were developed in the late 1960s and soon became widely applied in several commercial areas, most notably the coating and printing industry. Many of the glossy coatings on paper and cardboard, for example, are photopolymers. Additionally, photo-curable resins are used in dentistry, such as #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_463for sealing the top surfaces of teeth to ﬁll in deep grooves and prevent cavities. In these applications, coatings are cured by radiation that blankets the resin withoutthe need for patterning either the material or the radiation. This changed with the introduction of stereolithography. In the mid-1980s, Charles (Chuck) Hull was experimenting with UV-curable materials by exposing them to a scanning laser, similar to the system found in laserprinters. He discovered that solid polymer patterns could be produced. By curingone layer over a previous layer, he could fabricate a solid 3D part. This was thebeginning of stereolithography (SL) technology. The company 3D Systems wascreated shortly thereafter to market SL machines as “rapid prototyping” machinesto the product development industry. Since then, a wide variety of SL-related processes and technologies has been developed. The term “vat photopoly- merization” is a general term that encompasses SL and these related processes.SL will be used to refer speciﬁcally to macroscale, laser scan vat photopoly-merization; otherwise, the term vat polymerization will be used and will beabbreviated as VP. Various types of radiation may be used to cure commercial photopolymers, including gamma rays, X-rays, electron beams, UV, and in some cases visiblelight. In VP systems, UV and visible light radiation are used most commonly. In the microelectronics industry, photomask materials are often photopolymers and are typically irradiated using far UV and electron beams. In contrast, the ﬁeld ofdentistry uses visible light predominantly. Two primary conﬁgurations were developed for photopolymerization processes in a vat, plus one additional conﬁguration that has seen some research interest.Although photopolymers are also used in some ink-jet printing processes, thismethod of line-wise processing is not covered in this chapter, as the basicprocessing steps are more similar to the printing processes covered in Chap. 7. The conﬁgurations discussed in this chapter include: •Vector scan , or point-wise, approaches typical of commercial SL machines •Mask projection , or layer-wise, approaches, that irradiate entire layers at one time, and •Two-photon approaches that are essentially high-resolution point-by-point approaches These three conﬁgurations are shown schematically in Fig. 4.1. Note that in the vector scan and two-photon approaches, scanning laser beams are needed, while themask projection approach utilizes a large radiation beam that is patterned byanother device, in this case a Digital Micromirror Device ™(DMD). In the two-photon case, photopolymerization occurs at the intersection of two scanninglaser beams, although other conﬁgurations use a single laser and differentphotoinitiator chemistries. Another distinction is the need to recoat, or apply anew layer of resin, in the vector scan and mask projection approaches, while in the two-photon approach, the part is fabricated below the resin surface, making64 4 Vat Photopolymerization Processesrecoating unnecessary. Approaches that avoid recoating are faster and less complicated. In this chapter, we ﬁrst introduce photopolymer materials, then present the vector scan SL machines, technologies, and processes. Mask projection approachesare presented and contrasted with the vector scan approach. Additionalconﬁgurations, along with their applications, are presented at the end of the chapter.Advantages, disadvantages, and uniquenesses of each approach and technology arehighlighted. 4.2 Vat Photopolymerization Materials Some background of UV photopolymers will be presented in this section that iscommon to all conﬁgurations of photopolymerization processes. Two subsectionson reaction rates and characterization methods conclude this section. Much of thismaterial is from the Jacobs book [ 1] and from a Master’s thesis from the early 2000s [ 2].

In addition to the applications mentioned in Sect. 4.1, they are used as photoresists in the microelec- tronics industry. This application has had a major impact on the development of epoxy-based photopolymers. Photoresists are essentially one-layer SL, but withcritical requirements on accuracy and feature resolution. Various types of radiation may be used to cure commercial photopolymers, including gamma rays, X-rays, electron beams, UV, and in some cases visiblelight, although UV and electron beam are the most prevalent. In AM, many of theseradiation sources have been utilized in research, however only UV and visible lightsystems are utilized in commercial systems. In SL systems, for example, UV radiation is used exclusively although, in principle, other types could be used. In the SLA-250 from 3D Systems, a helium–cadmium (HeCd) laser is used with awavelength of 325 nm. In contrast, the solid-state lasers used in the other SL modelsare Nd-YVO In mask projection DMD-based systems, UV and visible light radiation are used. Thermoplastic polymers that are typically injection molded have a linear or branched molecular structure that allows them to melt and solidify repeatedly. Incontrast, VP photopolymers are cross-linked and, as a result, do not melt and exhibit much less creep and stress relaxation. Figure 4.2shows the three polymer structures mentioned [ 3]. The ﬁrst US patents describing SL resins were published in 1989 and 1990 [ 4, 5]. These resins were prepared from acrylates, which had high reactivity but typically produced weak parts due to the inaccuracy caused by shrinkage andcurling. The acrylate-based resins typically could only be cured to 46 % completionwhen the image was transferred through the laser [ 6]. When a fresh coating was put on the exposed layer, some radiation went through the new coating and initiated new photochemical reactions in the layer that was already partially cured. This layer was less susceptible to oxygen inhibition after it had been coated. Theadditional cross-linking on this layer caused extra shrinkage, which increasedstresses in the layer, and caused curling that was observed either during or afterthe part fabrication process [ 7]. The ﬁrst patents that prepared an epoxide composition for SL resins appeared in 1988 [ 8,9] (Japanese). The epoxy resins produced more accurate, harder, and stronger parts than the acrylate resins. While the polymerization of acrylate compositions leads to 5–20 % shrinkage, the ring-opening polymerization of epoxy compositions only leads to a shrinkage of 1–2 % [ 10]. This low level of shrinkage associated with epoxy chemistry contributes to excellent adhesion andreduced tendency for ﬂexible substrates to curl during cure. Furthermore, thepolymerization of the epoxy-based resins is not inhibited by atmospheric oxygen.This enables low-photoinitiator concentrations, giving lower residual odor thanacrylic formulations [ 11]. However, the epoxy resins have disadvantages of slow photospeed and brittle- ness of the cured parts. The addition of some acrylate to epoxy resins is required to66 4 Vat Photopolymerization Processesrapidly build part strength so that they will have enough integrity to be handled without distortion during fabrication. The acrylates are also useful to reduce thebrittleness of the epoxy parts [ 7]. Another disadvantage of epoxy resins is their sensitivity to humidity, which can inhibit polymerization [ 11]. As a result, most SL resins commercially available today are epoxides with some acrylate content. It is necessary to have both materials present in the same formula-tion to combine the advantages of both curing types. The improvement in accuracyresulting from the use of hybrid resins has given SL a tremendous boost. 4.2.2 Overview of Photopolymer Chemistry VP photopolymers are composed of several types of ingredients: photoinitiators,reactive diluents, ﬂexibilizers, stabilizers, and liquid monomers. Broadly speaking,when UV radiation impinges on VP resin, the photoinitiators undergo a chemicaltransformation and become “reactive” with the liquid monomers. A “reactive”photoinitiator reacts with a monomer molecule to start a polymer chain. Subsequentreactions occur to build polymer chains and then to cross-link—creation of strongcovalent bonds between polymer chains. Polymerization is the term used to describe the process of linking small molecules (monomers) into larger molecules (polymers) composed of many monomer units [ 1]. Two main types of photopoly- mer chemistry are commercially evident:linear branched cross-linkeda b cFig. 4.2 Schematics of polymer types4.2 Vat Photopolymerization Materials 67• Free-radical photopolymerization—acrylate Cationic photopolymerization—epoxy and vinylether The molecular structures of these types of photopolymers are shown in Fig. 4.5. Symbols C and H denote carbon and hydrogen atoms, respectively, while R denotesa molecular group which typically consists of one or more vinyl groups. A vinylgroup is a molecular structure with a carbon–carbon double bond. It is these vinylgroups in the R structures that enable photopolymers to become cross-linked. Free-radical photopolymerization was the ﬁrst type that was commercially developed. Such SL resins were acrylates. Acrylates form long polymer chainsonce the photoinitiator becomes “reactive,” building the molecule linearly by adding monomer segments. Cross-linking typically happens after the polymer chains grow enough so that they become close to one another. Acrylatephotopolymers exhibit high photospeed (react quickly when exposed to UV radia-tion), but have a number of disadvantages including signiﬁcant shrinkage and atendency to warp and curl. As a result, they are rarely used now without epoxy orother photopolymer elements. The most common cationic photopolymers are epoxies, although vinylethers are also commercially available. Epoxy monomers have rings, as shown in Fig. 4.3. When reacted, these rings open, resulting in sites for other chemical bonds. Ring- opening is known to impart minimal volume change on reaction, because thenumber and types of chemical bonds are essentially identical before and afterreaction [ 12]. As a result, epoxy SL resins typically have much smaller shrinkages and much less tendency to warp and curl. Almost all commercially available SLresins have signiﬁcant amounts of epoxies. Polymerization of VP monomers is an exothermic reaction, with heats of reaction around 85 kJ/mol for an example acrylate monomer. Despite high heats of reaction, a catalyst is necessary to initiate the reaction. As described earlier, a photoinitiator acts as the catalyst. Schematically, the free radical-initiated polymerization process can be illustrated as shown in Fig. 4.4[1]. On average, for every two photons (from the laser), one radical will be produced. That radical can easily lead to the polymeriza-tion of over 1,000 monomers, as shown in the intermediate steps of the process,called propagation. In general, longer polymer molecules are preferred, yieldinghigher molecular weights. This indicates a more complete reaction. In Fig. 4.4, the P–Iterm indicates a photoinitiator, the /C0I ●symbol is a free radical, and Min a monomer. Polymerization terminates from one of three causes, recombination, dispropor- tionation, or occlusion. Recombination occurs when two polymer chains merge byjoining two radicals. Disproportionation involves essentially the cancelation of oneradical by another, without joining. Occlusion occurs when free radicals become“trapped” within a solidiﬁed polymer, meaning that reaction sites remain available,but are prevented from reacting with other monomers or polymers by the limited mobility within the polymer network. These occluded sites will most certainly react eventually, but not with another polymer chain or monomer. Instead, they will react68 4 Vat Photopolymerization Processeswith oxygen or another reactive species that diffuses into the occluded region. This may be a cause of aging or other changes in mechanical properties of cured parts,which should be a topic of future research. Cationic photopolymerization shares the same broad structure as free-radical polymerization, where a photoinitiator generates a cation as a result of laser energy,the cation reacts with a monomer, propagation occurs to generate a polymer, and atermination process completes the reaction. A typical catalyst for a cationic poly- merization is a Lewis Acid, such as BF 3[13]. Initially, cationic photopoly- merization received little attention, but that has changed during the 1990s due toadvances in the microelectronics industry, as well as interest in SL technology.

Most of the monomers are multifunctional monomers (MFM) orpolyol polyacrylates which give a cross-linking polymerization. The main chemicalfamilies of oligomers are polyester acrylate (PEA), epoxy acrylates (EA), urethaneacrylates (UA), amino acrylates (used as photoaccelerator in the photoinitiatorsystem), and cycloaliphatic epoxies [ 11]. Resin suppliers create ready-to-use formulations by mixing the oligomers and monomers with a photoinitiator, as well as other materials to affect reaction rates and part properties. In practice, photosensitizers are often used in combination with the photoinitiator to shift the absorption towards longer wavelengths. In addition,supporting materials may be mixed with the initiator to achieve improved solubilityin the formulation. Furthermore, mixtures of different types of photoinitiators mayalso be employed for a given application. Thus, photoinitiating systems are, inpractice, often highly elaborate mixtures of various compounds which provideoptimum performance for speciﬁc applications [ 10]. Other additives facilitate the application process and achieve products of good properties. A reactive diluent, for example, is usually added to adjust the viscosity of the mixtures to an acceptable level for application [ 14]; it also participates in the polymerization reaction. 4.2.3.1 Photoinitiator System The role of the photoinitiator is to convert the physical energy of the incident lightinto chemical energy in the form of reactive intermediates. The photoinitiator mustexhibit a strong absorption at the laser emission wavelength, and undergo a fastphotolysis to generate the initiating species with a great quantum yield [ 15]. The reactive intermediates are either radicals capable of adding to vinylic or acrylicdouble bonds, thereby initiating radical polymerization, or reactive cationic specieswhich can initiate polymerization reactions among epoxy molecules [ 10]. The free-radical polymerization process was outlined in Fig. 4.4, with the formation of free radicals as the ﬁrst step. In the typical case in VP, radical photoinitiator systems include compounds that undergo unimolecular bond cleav-age upon irradiation. This class includes aromatic carbonyl compounds that areknown to undergo a homolytic C–C bond scission upon UV exposure [ 16]. The benzoyl radical is the major initiating species, while the other fragment may, insome cases, also contribute to the initiation. The most efﬁcient photoinitiatorsinclude benzoin ether derivatives, benzyl ketals, hydroxyalkylphenones, α-amino70 4 Vat Photopolymerization Processesketones, and acylphosphine oxides [ 16,17]. The Irgacure family of radical photoinitiators from Ciba Specialty Chemicals is commonly used in VP. While photoinitiated free-radical polymerizations have been investigated for more than 60 years, the corresponding photoinduced cationic polymerizations have received much less attention. The main reason for the slow development inthis area was the lack of suitable photoinitiators capable of efﬁciently inducingcationic polymerization [ 18]. Beginning in 1965, with the earliest work on diazo- nium salt initiators, this situation has markedly changed. The discovery in the 1970sof onium salts or organometallic compounds with excellent photoresponse and highefﬁciency has initiated the very rapid and promising development of cationicphotopolymerization, and made possible the concurrent radical and cationic reac- tion in hybrid systems [ 19]. Excellent reviews have been published in this ﬁeld [ 10, 18,20–23]. The most important cationic photoinitiators are the onium salts, partic- ularly the triarylsulfonium and diaryliodonium salts. Examples of the cationicphotoinitiator are triaryl sulfonium hexaﬂuorophosphate solutions in propylenecarbonate such as Degacure KI 85 (Degussa), SP-55 (Asahi Denka), Sarcat KI-85(Sartomer), and 53,113-8 (Aldrich), or mixtures of sulfonium salts such as SR-1010(Sartomer, currently unavailable), UVI 6976 (B-V), and UVI 6992 (B-VI) (Dow). Initiation of cationic polymerization takes place from not only the primary products of the photolysis of triarylsulfonium salts but also from secondary products of the reaction of those reactive species with solvents, monomers, oreven other photolysis species. Probably the most ubiquitous species present is theprotonic acid derived from the anion of the original salt. Undoubtedly, the largestportion of the initiating activity in cationic polymerization by photolysis oftriarylsulfonium salts is due to protonic acids [ 18]. 4.2.3.2 Monomer Formulations The monomer formulations presented here are from a set of patents from the mid- to late-1990s. Both di-functional and higher functionality monomers are used typi-cally in VP resins. Poly(meth)acrylates may be tri-, pentafunctional monomeric oroligomeric aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic (meth)acrylates, or polyfunctionalurethane (meth)acrylates [ 24–27]. One speciﬁc compound in the Huntsman SL-7510 resin includes the dipentaerythritol monohydroxy penta(meth)acrylates[26], such as Dipentaerythritol Pentaacrylate (SR-399, Sartomer). The cationically curable epoxy resins may have an aliphatic, aromatic, cycloali- phatic, araliphatic, or heterocyclic structure; they on average possess more than oneepoxide group (oxirane ring) in the molecule and comprise epoxide groups as sidegroups, or those groups form part of an alicyclic or heterocyclic ring system.Examples of epoxy resins of this type are also given by these patents such aspolyglycidyl esters or ethers, poly(N or S-glycidyl) compounds, and epoxidecompounds in which the epoxide groups form part of an alicyclic or heterocyclicring system. One speciﬁc composition includes at least 50 % by weight of a cycloaliphatic diepoxide [ 26] such as bis(2,3-epoxycyclopentyl) ether (formula A-I), 3,4-epoxycyclohexyl-methyl 3,4-epoxycyclohexanecarboxylate (A-II),4.2 Vat Photopolymerization Materials 71dicyclopentadiene diepoxide (A-III), and bis-(3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl) adipate (A-IV). Additional insight into compositions can be gained by investigating the patent literature further. 4.2.3.3 Interpenetrating Polymer Network Formation As described earlier, acrylates polymerize radically, while epoxides cationicallypolymerize to form their respective polymer networks. In the presence of each other during the curing process, an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) is ﬁnallyobtained [ 28,29]. An IPN can be deﬁned as a combination of two polymers in network form, at least one of which is synthesized and/or cross-linked in theimmediate presence of the other [ 30]. It is therefore a special class of polymer blends in which both polymers generally are in network form [ 30–32], and which is originally generated by the concurrent reactions instead of by a simple mechanicalmixing process. In addition, it is a polymer blend rather than a copolymer that is generated from the hybrid curing [ 33], which indicates that acrylate and epoxy monomers undergo independent polymerization instead of copolymerization. How-ever, in special cases, copolymerization can occur, thus leading to a chemicalbonding of the two networks [ 34]. It is likely that in typical SL resins, the acrylate and epoxide react independently. Interestingly, however, these two monomers deﬁnitely affect each other physicallyduring the curing process. The reaction of acrylate will enhance the photospeed andreduce the energy requirement of the epoxy reaction. Also, the presence of acrylate monomer may decrease the inhibitory effect of humidity on the epoxy polymeriza- tion. On the other hand, the epoxy monomer acts as a plasticizer during the earlypolymerization of the acrylate monomer where the acrylate forms a network whilethe epoxy is still at liquid stage [ 31]. This plasticizing effect, by increasing molecular mobility, favors the chain propagation reaction [ 35]. As a result, the acrylate polymerizes more extensively in the presence of epoxy than in the neatacrylate monomer. Furthermore, the reduced sensitivity of acrylate to oxygen in thehybrid system than in the neat composition may be due to the simultaneous polymerization of the epoxide which makes the viscosity rise, thus slowing down the diffusion of atmospheric oxygen into the coating [ 31]. In addition, it has been shown [ 31] that the acrylate/epoxide hybrid system requires a shorter exposure to be cured than either of the two monomers takenseparately. It might be due to the plasticizing effect of epoxy monomer and thecontribution of acrylate monomer to the photospeed of the epoxy polymerization.The two monomers beneﬁt from each other by a synergistic effect. It should be noted that if the concentration of the radical photoinitiator was decreased so that the two polymer networks were generated simultaneously, the plasticizing effect of the epoxy monomer would become less pronounced. As aresult, it would be more difﬁcult to achieve complete polymerization of the acrylatemonomer and thus require longer exposure time. Although the acrylate/epoxy hybrid system proceeds via a heterogeneous mech- anism, the resultant product (IPN) seems to be a uniphase component [ 36]. The72 4 Vat Photopolymerization Processesproperties appear to be extended rather than compromised [ 31,34]. The optimal properties of IPNs for speciﬁc applications can be obtained by selecting twoappropriate components and adjusting their proportions [ 34]. For example, increas- ing the acrylate content increases the cure speed but decreases the adhesion characteristics, while increasing the epoxy content reduces the shrinkage of curingand improves the adhesion, but decreases the cure speed [ 36]. 4.3 Reaction Rates As is evident, the photopolymerization reaction in VP resins is very complex. To date, no one has published an analytical photopolymerization model that describes reaction results and reaction rates. However, qualitative understanding of reactionrates is straightforward for simple formulations. Broadly speaking, reaction ratesfor photopolymers are controlled by concentrations of photoinitiators [I] andmonomers [M]. The rate of polymerization is the rate of monomer consumption,which can be shown as [ 3]: R p¼/C0dM½/C138=dtαM½/C138 kI½/C138ðÞ1=2ð4:1Þ where k¼constant that is a function of radical generation efﬁciency, rate of radical initiation, and rate of radical termination. Hence, the polymerization rate is propor- tional to the concentration of monomer, but is only proportional to the square rootof initiator concentration. Using similar reasoning, it can be shown that the average molecular weight of polymers is the ratio of the rate of propagation and the rate of initiation. Thisaverage weight is called the kinetic average chain length, v o, and is given in ( 4.2): vo¼Rp=RiαM½/C138=I½/C1381=2ð4:2Þ where Riis the rate of initiation of macromonomers. Equations ( 4.1) and ( 4.2) have important consequences for the VP process. The higher the rate of polymerization, the faster parts can be built. Since VP resins arepredominantly composed of monomers, the monomer concentration cannot bechanged much. Hence, the only other direct method for controlling the polymeriza-tion rate and the kinetic average chain length is through the concentration ofinitiator. However, ( 4.1) and ( 4.2) indicate a trade-off between these characteristics. Doubling the initiator concentration only increases the polymerization rate by afactor of 1.4, but reduces the molecular weight of resulting polymers by the same amount. Strictly speaking, this analysis is more appropriate for acrylate resins, since epoxies continue to react after laser exposure, so ( 4.2) does not apply well for epoxies. However, reaction of epoxies is still limited, so it can be concluded that atrade-off does exist between polymerization rate and molecular weight for epoxyresins.4.3 Reaction Rates 734.4 Laser Scan Vat Photopolymerization Laser scan VP creates solid parts by selectively solidifying a liquid photopolymer resin using an UV laser. As with many other AM processes, the physical parts aremanufactured by fabricating cross-sectional contours, or slices, one on top of another. These slices are created by tracing 2D contours of a CAD model in a vat of photopolymer resin with a laser. The part being built rests on a platform that isdipped into the vat of resin, as shown schematically in Fig. 4.1a. After each slice is created, the platform is lowered, the surface of the vat is recoated, then the laserstarts to trace the next slice of the CAD model, building the prototype from thebottom up. A more complete description of the SL process may be found in[12]. The creation of the part requires a number of key steps: input data, part preparation, layer preparation, and ﬁnally laser scanning of the two-dimensional cross-sectional slices. The input data consist of an STL ﬁle created from a CAD ﬁle or reverse engineering data. Part preparation is the phase at which the operatorspeciﬁes support structures, to hold each cross section in place while the part builds,and provides values for machine parameters. These parameters control how theprototype is fabricated in the VP machine. Layer preparation is the phase in whichthe STL model is divided into a series of slices, as deﬁned by the part preparationphase, and translated by software algorithms into a machine language. This infor-mation is then used to drive the SL machine and fabricate the prototype. The laser scanning of the part is the phase that actually solidiﬁes each slice in the VP machine. After building the part, the part must be cleaned, post-cured, and ﬁnished. During the cleaning and ﬁnishing phase, the VP machine operator may removesupport structures. During ﬁnishing, the operator may spend considerable timesanding and ﬁling the part to provide the desired surface ﬁnishes. 4.5 Photopolymerization Process Modeling Background on SL materials and energy sources enables us to investigate the curingprocess of photopolymers in SL machines. We will begin with an investigation intothe fundamental interactions of laser energy with photopolymer resins. Through theapplication of the Beer–Lambert law, the theoretical relationship between resincharacteristics and exposure can be developed, which can be used to specify laserscan speeds. This understanding can then be applied to investigate mechanicalproperties of cured resins. From here, we will brieﬂy investigate the ranges ofsize scales and time scales of relevance to the SL process. Much of this section is adapted from [ 1].

However, it is also important to consider the width ofthe cured line as well as its proﬁle. The shape of the cured line depends on resin characteristics, laser energy characteristics, and the scan speed. We will investigate the relationships among all of these factors in this subsection. The ﬁrst concept of interest here is irradiance , the radiant power of the laser per unit area, H(x,y,z). As the laser scans a line, the radiant power is distributed over a ﬁnite area (beam spots are not inﬁnitesimal). Figure 4.5shows a laser scanning a line along the x-axis at a speed V s[1]. Consider the z-axis oriented perpendicular to the resin surface and into the resin, and consider the origin such that the point ofinterest, p 0, has an xcoordinate of 0. The irradiance at any point x,y,zin the resin is related to the irradiance at the surface, assuming that the resin absorbs radiation according to the Beer–Lambert Law. The general form of the irradiance equationfor a Gaussian laser beam is given here as ( 4.3). Hx;y;zðÞ ¼ Hx;y;0ðÞ e /C0z=Dpð4:3Þ From this relationship, we can understand the meaning of the penetration depth, Dp. Setting z¼Dp, we get that the irradiance at a depth Dpis about 37 % (e/C01¼0.36788) of the irradiance at the resin surface. Thus, Dpis the depth into the resin at which the irradiance is 37 % of the irradiance at the surface. Further-more, since we are assuming the Beer–Lambert Law holds, D pis only a function of the resin. Without loss of generality, we will assume that the laser scans along the x-axis from the origin to point b. Then, the irradiance at coordinate xalong the scan line is given by4.5 Photopolymerization Process Modeling 75Hx;y;0ðÞ ¼ Hx;yðÞ ¼ H0e/C02x2=W2 0e/C02y2=W2 0 ð4:4Þ where H0¼H(0,0) when x¼0, and W0is the 1/e2Gaussian half-width of the beam spot.

The maximum irradiance, H0, occurs at the center of the beam spot ( x¼0).H0 can be determined by integrating the irradiance function over the area covered by the beam at any particular point in time. Changing from Cartesian to polar coordinates, the integral can be set equal to the laser power, PL, as shown in ( 4.5).

Exposure is the energy per unitarea; when exposure at a point in the resin vat exceeds a critical value, called E c,w e assume that resin cures. Exposure can be determined at point pby appropriately integrating ( 4.7) along the scan line, from time 0 to time tb, when the laser reaches point b.Vs r zpp’ yxWoFig. 4.5 Scan line of Gaussian laser76 4 Vat Photopolymerization ProcessesEy;0ðÞ ¼Zt¼tb t¼0HxtðÞ,0½/C138 dt ð4:8Þ It is far more convenient to integrate over distance than over time.

This behavior localizes the exposure within a narrow range around the scan vector. This makes sense since the laser beam is small and weexpect that the energy received from the laser drops off quickly outside of its radius.

As we will see, thecross-sectional shape of a cured line becomes a parabola. Starting with ( 4.12), the locus of points in the resin that is just at its gel point, where E¼E c, is denoted by y* and z*.

First, line width is proportional to the beam spot size. Second, if a greater cure depth is desired, line width must increase, all else remaining the same. This becomes very important when performing line width compensation during process planning. The ﬁnal concept to be presented in this subsection is fundamental to commer- cial SL. It is the working curve , which relates exposure to cure depth, and includes the two key resin constants, DpandEc. At the resin surface and in the center of the scan line: E0;0ðÞ /C17 Emax¼ﬃﬃﬃ 2 πr PL W0Vsð4:18Þ which is most of the expression within the logarithm term in ( 4.16). Substituting (4.18) into ( 4.16) yields the working curve equation: Cd¼DPlnEmax Ec/C18/C19 ð4:19Þ In summary, a laser of power PLscans across the resin surface at some speed Vs solidifying resin to a depth Cd, the cure depth, assuming that the total energy incident along the scan vector exceeds a critical value called the critical exposure,E c. If the laser scans too quickly, no polymerization reaction takes place; i.e., exposure Eis less than Ec.Ecis assumed to be a characteristic quantity of a particular resin. An example working curve is shown in Fig. 4.7, where measured cure depths at a given exposure are indicated by “*.” The working curve equation, ( 4.19), has several major properties [ 1]:ZXY CdLwFig. 4.6 Cured line showing parabolic shape, cure depth, and line width4.5 Photopolymerization Process Modeling 791. The cure depth is proportional to the natural logarithm of the maximum exposure on the centerline of a scanned laser beam. A semilog plot of Cdvs.Emaxshould be a straight line. This plot is known as the working curve for a given resin. The slope of the working curve is precisely Dpat the laser wavelength being used to generate the working curve. The x-axis intercept of the working curve is Ec, the critical exposure of the resin at that wavelength. Theoretically, the cure depth is 0 at Ec, but this does indicate the gel point of the resin. Since Dpand Ecare purely resin parameters, the slope and intercept of the working curve are independent of laser power. In practice, various Emaxvalues can be generated easily by varying the laser scan speed, as indicated by ( 4.19). 4.5.3 Photospeed Photospeed is typically used as an intuitive approximation of SL photosensitivity. But it is useful in that it relates to the speed at which the laser can be scanned acrossthe polymer surface to give a speciﬁed cure depth. The faster the laser can bescanned to give a desired cure depth, the higher the photospeed.

In particular, photospeed is indicated by the resin constants Ec and Dp, where higher levels of Dpand lower values of Ecindicate higher photospeed. To determine scan velocity for a desired cure depth, it is straightforward to solve (4.16) for Vs. Recall that at the maximum cure depth, the exposure received equals the cure threshold, Ec. Scan velocity is given by ( 4.20). Vs¼ﬃﬃﬃ 2 πr PL W0Ece/C0Cd=DPð4:20Þ This discussion can be related back to the working curve. Both EcandDpmust be determined experimentally. 3D Systems has developed a procedure called theWINDOWPANE procedure for ﬁnding E candDpvalues [ 41]. The cure depth, Cd, can be measured directly from specimens built on an SL machine that are one layerthickness in depth. The WINDOWPANE procedure uses a speciﬁc part shape, but the principle is simply to build a part with different amounts of laser exposure in different places in the part. By measuring the part thickness, C d, and correlating that with the exposure values, a “working curve” can easily be plotted. Note that ( 4.19) is log-linear. Hence, Cdis plotted linearly vs. the logarithm of exposure to generate a working curve. So how is exposure varied? Exposure is varied by simply using different scan velocities in different regions of the WINDOWPANE part. The different scanvelocities will result in different cure depths. In practice, ( 4.20) is very useful since we want to directly control cure depth, and want to determine how fast to scan the laser to give that cure depth. Of course, for the WINDOWPANE experi-ment, it is more useful to use ( 4.16)o r( 4.19). 4.5.4 Time Scales It is interesting to investigate the time scales at which SL operates. On the short end of the time scale, the time it takes for a photon of laser light to traverse aphotopolymer layer is about a picosecond (10 –12s). Photon absorption by the photoinitiator and the generation of free radicals or cations occur at about thesame time frame. A measure of photopolymer reaction speed is the kinetic reactionrates, t k, which are typically several microseconds. The time it takes for the laser to scan past a particular point on the resin surface is related to the size of the laser beam. We will call this time the characteristic exposure time, te. Values of teare typically 50–2,000 μs, depending on the scan speed (500–5,000 mm/s). Laser exposure continues long after the onset of poly-merization. Continued exposure generates more free radicals or cations and, pre-sumably, generates these at points deeper in the photopolymer. During and after thelaser beam traverses the point of interest, cross-linking occurs in the photopolymer.4.5 Photopolymerization Process Modeling 81The onset of measurable shrinkage, ts,o, lags exposure by several orders of magnitude. This appears to be due to the rate of cross-linking, but for the epoxy-based resins, may have more complicated characteristics. Time at corresponding completion of shrinkage is denoted t s,c. For the acrylate-based resins of the early 1990s, times for the onset and completion of shrinkage were typically 0.4–1 and 4–10 s, respectively. Recall that epoxies can take hours or days to polymerize. Sinceshrinkage lags exposure, this is clearly a phenomenon that complicates the VPprocess. Shrinkage leads directly to accuracy problems, including deviation fromnominal dimensions, warpage, and curl. The ﬁnal time dimension is that of scan time for a layer, denoted t d, which typically spans 10–300 s. The time scales can be summarized as tt/C28tk/C28te/C28ts,o<ts,c/C28td ð4:21Þ As a result, characteristic times for the VP process span about 14 orders of magnitude. 4.6 Vector Scan VP Machines At present (2014), 3D Systems is the predominant manufacturer of laser scanningVP machines in the world, although several other companies in Japan and else-where in Asia also market VP machines. Fockele & Schwarze in Germany produces a micro-VP technology, although they only sell design and manufacturing services. Several Japanese companies produce or produced machines, including DenkenEngineering, CMET (Mitsubishi), Sony, Meiko Corp., Mitsui Zosen, and TeijinSeiki (license from Dupont). Formlabs is a start-up company, funded in part by aKickstarter campaign, markets a small, high-resolution SL machine. A schematic of a typical VP machine was illustrated in Fig. 4.1a, which shows the main subsystems, including the laser and optics, the platform and elevator, thevat and resin-handling subsystem, and the recoater. The machine subsystem hierar- chy is given in Fig. 4.8. Note that the ﬁve main subsystems are: recoating system, platform system, vat system, laser and optics system, and control system. Typically, recoating is done using a shallow dip and recoater blade sweeping. Recoating issues are discussed in [ 37]. The process can be described as follows: After a layer has been cured, the platform dips down by a layer thickness. The recoater blade slides over the whole build depositing a new layer of resin and smoothing the surface of the vat. A common recoater blade type is the zephyr blade, which is a hollow blade that is ﬁlled with resin. A vacuum system pulls resin into the blade from the vat. As theblade translates over the vat to perform recoating, resin is deposited in regionswhere the previous part cross section was built. When the blade encounters a regionin the vat without resin, the resin falls into this region since its weight is stronger82 4 Vat Photopolymerization Processesthan the vacuum force. Blade alignment is critical to avoid “blade crashes,” when the blade hits the part being built and often delaminates the previous layer. Theblade gap (distance between the bottom of the blade and the resin surface) and speed are important variables under user control. The platform system consists of a build platform that supports the part being built and an elevator that lowers and raises the platform. The elevator is driven by alead-screw. The vat system is simply the vat that holds the resin, combined with alevel adjustment device, and usually an automated reﬁll capability. The optics system includes a laser, focusing and adjustment optics, and two galvanometers that scan the laser beam across the surface of the vat. Modern VPmachines have solid-state lasers that have more stable characteristics than their predecessors, various gas lasers. SL machines from 3D Systems have Nd-YVO 4 lasers that output radiation at about 1,062 nm wavelength (near infrared). Addi- tional optical devices triple the frequency to 354 nm, in the UV range. These lasershave relatively low power, in the range of 0.1–1 W, compared with lasers used inother AM and material processing applications. The control system consists of three main subsystems. First, a process controller controls the sequence of machine operations. Typically, this involves executing thesequence of operations that are described in the build ﬁle that was prepared for a speciﬁc part or set of parts. Commands are sent to the various subsystems to actuate the recoating blade, to adjust resin level or changing the vat height, or to activate thebeam controller. Sensors are used to detect resin height and to detect forces on therecoater blade to detect blade crashes. Second, the beam controller converts opera-tion descriptions into actions that adjust beam spot size, focus depth, and scanspeed, with some sensors providing feedback. Third, the environment controlleradjusts resin vat temperature and, depending on machine model, adjusts environ-ment temperature and humidity. Two of the main advantages of VP technology over other AM technologies are part accuracy and surface ﬁnish, in combination with moderate mechanicalproperties. These characteristics led to the widespread usage of VP parts as form,SL Machine Lenses ScanningTemperature SensorsBeam SensorsRecoating System Blade Elevator Resin Level AdjustmentResin DeliveryVatBeam GenerationEnvironment ControlBeam ControlProcess ControlPlatform SystemVat System Drive SystemLaser & Optics SystemControl System Fig. 4.8 Subsystems for SL technology4.6 Vector Scan VP Machines 83ﬁt, and, to a lesser extent, functional prototypes. Typical dimensional accuracies for VP machines are often quoted as a ratio of an error per unit length. For example,accuracy of an SLA-250 is typically quoted as 0.002 in./in. [ 38]. Modern VP machines are somewhat more accurate. Surface ﬁnish of SL parts ranges from submicron Ra for upfacing surfaces to over 100 μm Ra for surfaces at slanted angles [ 39]. The current commercial VP product line from 3D Systems consists of two families of models: the SLA Viper Si2, and the iPro SLA Centers (iPro 9000XL,iPro 9000, and iPro 8000). Some of these machines are summarized in Table 4.1 [40]. Both the Viper Si2 and the iPro models have dual laser spot size capabilities. In the Viper Si2, a “high-resolution” mode is available that provides a spot size of about 80 μm in diameter, useful for building small parts with ﬁne features. In the iPro machines, in contrast, the machine automatically switches between the “nor-mal” beam of 0.13 mm diameter for borders and ﬁlls and the “wide” beam of0.76 mm diameter for hatch vectors (ﬁlling in large areas). The wide beam enablesmuch faster builds. The iPro line replaces other machines, including the popularSLA-3500, SLA-5000, and SLA-7000 machines, as well as the SLA Viper Pro.Additionally, the SLA-250 was a very popular model that was discontinued in 2001with the introduction of the Viper Si2 model. 4.7 Scan Patterns 4.7.1 Layer-Based Build Phenomena and Errors Several phenomena should be noted since they are common to all radiation andlayer-based AM processes. The most obvious phenomenon is discretization, e.g., astack of layers causes “stair steps” on slanted or curved surfaces. So, the layer-wisenature of most AM processes causes edges of layers to be visible. Conventionally,commercial AM processes build parts in a “material safe” mode, meaning that thestair steps are on the outside of the CAD part surfaces. Technicians can sand or ﬁnish parts; the material they remove is outside of the desired part geometry. Other discretization examples are the set of laser scans or the pixels of a DMD. In mostprocesses, individual laser scans or pixels are not visible on part surfaces, but inother processes such as material extrusion, the individual ﬁlaments can benoticeable. As a laser scans a cross section, or a lamp illuminates a layer, the material solidiﬁes and, as a result, shrinks. When resins photopolymerize, they shrink sincethe volume occupied by monomer molecules is larger than that of reacted polymer. Similarly, after powder melts, it cools and freezes, which reduces the volume of the material. When the current layer is processed, its shrinkage pulls on the previouslayers, causing stresses to build up in the part. Typically, those stresses remain andare called residual stresses. Also, those stresses can cause part edges to curlupwards. Other warpage or part deformations can occur due to these residualstresses, as well.84 4 Vat Photopolymerization ProcessesTable 4.1 Selected SL systems (photos courtesy of 3D Systems, Inc.) iPro 9000XL SLA center Laser type Solid-state frequency tripled Nd:YV0 4 Wavelength 354.7 nm Power at vat @ 5,000 h1,450 mW Recoating system Process Zephyr ™Recoater Layer thickness min 0.05 mm (0.002 in)Layer thickness max 0.15 mm (0.006 in)Optical and scanningBeam diameter (@ 1/e2)0.13 mm (borders) 0.76 (large hatch) Drawing speed 3.5 m/s (borders) 25 m/s (hatch) Maximum part weight 150 kg (330 lb)Vat: Max. build envelope, capacity650/C2350/C2300 (39.1 gal) 650/C2750/C250 (25.1 gal) 650/C2750/C2275 (71.9 gal) 650/C2750/C2550 (109 gal) 1,500 /C2750/C2550 iPro 8000 SLA centerSpeciﬁcations are the same as the iPro 9000XL, except the following Maximum part weight 75 kg (165 lb)Vat: Max. build envelope, capacity650/C2350/C2300 (39.1 gal) 650/C2750/C250 (25.1 gal) 650/C2750/C2275 (71.9 gal) 650/C2750/C2550 (109 gal) SLA Viper Si2Laser type Solid-State Nd:YV0 4 Wavelength 354.7 nmPower at vat 100 mW (continued)4.7 Scan Patterns 85The last phenomenon to be discussed is that of print-through errors. In photopolymerization processes, it is necessary to have the current layer cure into the previous layer. In powder bed fusion processes, the current layer needs to melt into the previous layer so that one solid part results, instead of a stack of discon-nected solid layers. The extra energy that extends below the current layer results inthicker part sections. This extra thickness is called print-through error in SL and“bonus Z” in laser sintering. Most process planning systems compensate for print-through by giving users the option of skipping the ﬁrst few layers of a part, whichworks well unless important features are contained within those layers. These phenomena will be illustrated in this section through an investigation of scan patterns in SL. 4.7.2 WEAVE Prior to the development of WEAVE, scan patterns were largely an ad hoc development. As a result, post-cure curl distortion was the major accuracy problem.The WEAVE scan pattern became available for use in late 1990 [ 1]. The development of WEAVE began with the observation that distortion in post- cured parts was proportional to the percent of uncured resin after removal from thevat. Another motivating factor was the observation that shrinkage lags exposure andthat this time lag must be considered when planning the pattern of laser scans. Thekey idea in WEAVE development was to separate the curing of the majority of alayer from the adherence of that layer to the previous layer. Additionally, to preventTable 4.1 (continued) Recoating System: processZephyr recoater Typical 0.1 mm (0.004 in) app. Minimum 0.05 mm (0.002 in) app. Optical and scanningBeam diameter (@ 1/e2): standard mode0.25/C60.025 mm (0.01/C60.001 in) High-resolution 0.075 /C60.015 mm (0.003 /C60.0005 in) Part drawing speed 5 mm/s (0.2 in/s) Maximum part weight 9.1 kg (20 lb) Vat capacity VolumeMaximum build envelope250/C2250/C2200 mm XYZ (10 /C2/C210/C210 in) 32.2 L (8.5 U.S. gal) High-res. build envelope125/C2125/C2250 mm (5/C25/C210 in)86 4 Vat Photopolymerization Processeslaser scan lines from interfering with one another while each is shrinking, parallel scans were separated from one another by more than a line width. The WEAVE style consists of two sets of parallel laser scans: First, parallel to the x-axis, spaced 1 mil (1 mil ¼0.001 in. ¼0.0254 mm, which historically is a standard unit of measure in SL) apart, with a cure depth of 1 milless than the layer thickness. Second, parallel to the y-axis, spaced 1 mil apart, again with a cure depth of 1 mil less than the layer thickness. However, it is important to understand the relationships between cure depth and exposure. On the ﬁrst pass, a certain cure depth is achieved, C d1, based on an amount of exposure, Emax1. On the second pass, the same amount of exposure is provided and the cure depth increases to Cd2. A simple relationship can be derived among these quantities, as shown in ( 4.21). Cd2¼Dpln 2Emax 1 =Ec ðÞ ¼ Dpln 2ðÞ þ DplnEmax 1 =Ec ðÞ ð 4:21Þ Cd2¼Cd1þDpln 2ðÞ ð 4:22Þ It is the second pass that provides enough exposure to adhere the current layer to the previous one. The incremental cure depth caused by the second pass is just ln(2) Dp, or about 0.6931 Dp. This distance is always greater than 1 mil. As mentioned, a major cause of post-cure distortion was the amount of uncured resin after scanning. The WEAVE build style cures about 99 % of the resin at thevat surface and about 96 % of the resin volume through the layer thickness.Compared with previous build styles, WEAVE provided far superior results interms of eliminating curl and warpage. Figure 4.9shows a typical WEAVE pattern, illustrating how WEAVE gets its name. 1 milLw hs xy Fig. 4.9 WEAVE scan pattern4.7 Scan Patterns 87Even though WEAVE was a tremendous improvement, several ﬂaws were observed with its usage. Corners were distorted on large ﬂat surfaces, one ofthese corners always exhibited larger distortion, and it was always the same corner. Some microﬁssures occurred; on a ﬂat plate with a hole, a macroﬁssure tangent to the hole would appear. It was concluded that signiﬁcant internal stresses developed within parts during part building, not only post-cure. As a result, improvements to WEAVE wereinvestigated, leading to the development of STAR-WEAVE. 4.7.3 STAR-WEAVE STAR-WEAVE was released in October 1991, roughly 1 year after WEAVE[1]. STAR-WEAVE addressed all of the known deﬁciencies of WEAVE and worked very well with the resins available at the time. WEAVE’s deﬁciencieswere traced to the consequences of two related phenomena: the presence ofshrinkage and the lag of shrinkage relative to exposure. These phenomena leddirectly to the presence of large internal stresses in parts. STAR-WEAVE gets its name from the three main improvements from WEAVE: Staggered hatch Alternating sequence3. Retracted hatch Staggered hatch directly addresses the observed microﬁssures. Consider Fig.4.10 which shows a cross-sectional view of the hatch vectors from two layers. In Fig. 4.10a , the hatch vectors in WEAVE form vertical “walls” that do not directly touch. In STAR-WEAVE, Fig. 4.10b , the hatch vectors are staggered such that they directly adhere to the layer below. This resulting overlap from one layer to the nexteliminated microﬁssures and eliminated stress concentrations in the regionsbetween vectors. hs hsab WEAVE STAR-WEAVE Fig. 4.10 Cross-sectional view of WEAVE and STAR-WEAVE patterns88 4 Vat Photopolymerization ProcessesUpon close inspection, it became clear why the WEAVE scan pattern tended to cause internal stresses, particularly if a part had a large cross section. Consider a thin cross section, as shown in Fig. 4.11. The WEAVE pattern was set up to always proceed in a certain manner. First, the x-axis vectors were drawn left to right, and front to back. Then, the y-axis vectors were drawn front to back and left to right. Consider what happens as the y-axis vectors are drawn and the fact that shrinkage lags exposure. As successive vectors are drawn, previous vectors are shrinking, but these vectors have adhered to the x-axis vectors and to the previous layer. In effect, the successive shrinkage of y-axis vectors causes a “wave” of shrinkage from left to right, effectively setting up signiﬁcant internal stresses. These stresses cause curl. Given this behavior, it is clear that square cross sections will have internal stresses, possibly without visible curl. However, if the part cannot curl, the stresses will remain and may result in warpage or other form errors. With a better understanding of curing and shrinking behavior, the Alternating Sequence enhancement to building styles was introduced. This behavior can be alleviated to a large extent simply by varying the xandyscan patterns. There are two vector types: xandy. These types can be drawn left to right, right to left, front to back, and back to front. Looking at all combinations, eight different scan sequences are possible. As a part is being built, these eight scan sequences alternate, so that eight consecutive layers have different patterns, and this pattern is repeated every eight layers. The good news is that internal stresses were reduced and the macroﬁssures disappeared. However, internal stresses were still evident. To alleviate the internal stresses to a greater extent, the ﬁnal improvement in STAR-WEAVE was introduced, that of Retracted Hatch. It is important to realize that the border of a cross section is scanned ﬁrst, then the hatch is scanned. As a result, the x-axis vectors adhere to both the left and right border vectors. When they shrink, they pull Fig. 4.11 WEAVE problem example4.7 Scan Patterns 89on the borders, bending them towards one another, causing internal stresses. To alleviate this, alternating hatch vectors are retracted from the border, as shown inFig.4.12. This retracted hatch is performed for both the xandyvectors. 4.7.4 ACES Scan Pattern With the development of epoxy-based photopolymers in 1992–1993, new scan patterns were needed to best adopt to their curing characteristics. ACES (Accurate,Clear, Epoxy, Solid) was the answer to these needs. ACES is not just a scan pattern,but is a family of build styles. The operative word in the ACES acronym isAccurate. ACES was mainly developed to provide yet another leap in part accuracyby overcoming deﬁciencies in STAR-WEAVE, most particularly, in percent ofresin cured in the vat. Rather than achieving 96 % solidiﬁcation, ACES is typicallycapable of 98 %, further reducing post-cure shrinkage and the associated internal stresses, curl, and warpage [ 12]. Machine operators have a lot of control over the particular scan pattern used, along with several other process variables. For example, while WEAVE and STAR-WEAVE utilized 0.001 in. spacings between solidiﬁed lines, ACES allows the userto specify hatch spacing. Table 4.2shows many of the process variables for the SLA-250 along with typical ranges of variable settings. HatchBorder 0.01 inchFig. 4.12 Retracted hatch of the STAR-WEAVE pattern Table 4.2 ACES process variables for the SLA-250Variable Range Layer thickness 0.002–0.008 in.

Blade gap % 100–200Sweep period 5–15 sZ-wait 0–20 sPre-dip delay 0–20 s90 4 Vat Photopolymerization ProcessesIn Table 4.2, the ﬁrst four variables are called scan variables since they control the scan pattern, while the remaining variables are recoat variables since they controlhow the vat and part are recoated. With this set of variables, the machine operator has a tremendous amount of control over the process; however, the number of variables can cause a lot of confusion since it is difﬁcult to predict exactly how the part willbehave as a result of changing a variable’s value. To address this issue, 3D Systemsprovides nominal values for many of the variables as a function of layer thickness. The fundamental premise behind ACES is that of curing more resin in a layer before bonding that layer to the previous one. This is accomplished by overlappinghatch vectors, rather than providing 0.001 in. spacing between hatch vectors. As aresult, each point in a layer is exposed to laser radiation from multiple scans. Hence, it is necessary to consider these multiple scans when determining cure depth for a layer. ACES also makes use of two passes of scan vectors, one parallel to the x-axis and one parallel to the y-axis. In the ﬁrst pass, the resin is cured to a depth 1 mil less than the desired layer thickness. Then on the second pass, the remaining resin iscured and the layer is bonded to the previous one. As might be imagined, more scan vectors are necessary using the ACES scan pattern, compared with WEAVE and STAR-WEAVE. The remaining presentation in this section is on the mathematical model of cure depth as a function of hatch spacing to provide insight into the cure behavior of ACES. Consider Fig. 4.13 that shows multiple, overlapping scan lines with hatch spacing h s. Also shown is the cure depth of each line, Cd0, and the cure depth, 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 –0.05 –0.15 –0.25 –0.35–0.1 –0.2 –0.3 –0.4 0 0.2Percent of EmaxCure Depth [mm] 0.4 0.6 Y [mm]0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4Cd0EPhs Emax Cd1 Fig. 4.13 Cure depth and exposure for the ACES scan pattern4.7 Scan Patterns 91Cd1, of the entire scan pass. As we know from earlier, the relationship between exposure and cure depth is given by ( 4.23). Cd0¼DplnEmax=Ec ðÞ ð 4:23Þ The challenge is to ﬁnd an expression for cure depth of a scan pass when the scan vectors overlap. This can be accomplished by starting from the relationship describ-ing the spatial distribution of exposure. From earlier, we know that: Ey;0ðÞ ¼ E maxe/C02y2=W2 0ðÞð4:24Þ Consider the progression of curing that results from many more scans in Fig.4.13. If we consider a point Pin the region of the central scan, we need to determine the number of scan vectors that provide signiﬁcant exposure to P. Since the region of inﬂuence is proportional to beam spot size, the number of scansdepends upon the beam size and the hatch spacing. Considering that the ratio ofhatch spacing to beam half-width, W 0, is rarely less than 0.5 (i.e., hs/W0/C210.5), then we can determine that point Preceives about 99 % of its exposure from a distance of 4 hsor less. In other words, if we start at the center of a scan vector, at most, we need to consider 4 scans to the left and 4 scans to the right when determining curedepth. In this case, we are only concerned with the variation of exposure with y, the dimension perpendicular to the scan direction. Given that it is necessary to consider 9 scans, we know the various values of yin (4.24). We can consider that y¼nh s, and let nrange from /C04 to +4. Then, the total exposure received at a point Pis the sum of the exposures received over those 9 scans, as shown in ( 4.25) and ( 4.26).

Ep Emax¼1þX4 n¼1e/C02nhs=W0 ðÞ2ð4:27Þ We can now return to our initial objective of determining the cure depth for a single pass of overlapping scan vectors. Further, we can determine the increase incure depth from a single scan to the entire layer. A cure depth for a single pass, C d1,92 4 Vat Photopolymerization Processeswith overlapping scans is a function of the total exposure given in ( 4.26).Cd1is determined using ( 4.28). Cd1¼DPlnEp=Ec/C0/C1 ð4:28Þ The cure depth increase is given by Cd1/C0Cd0and can be determined using (4.29). Cd1/C0Cd0¼DPlnEp=Emax/C0/C1 ð4:29Þ As an example, consider that we desire a layer thickness to be 4 mils using a resin with a Dpof 5.8 mils. Assume further that the desired hatch spacing is 6 mils and the beam half-width is 5 mils, giving a size ratio of hs/W0¼1.2. On the ﬁrst pass, the cure depth, Cd1, should be 4 /C01¼3 mils. From ( 4.27), the exposure ratio can be determined to be 1.1123 (or see Fig. 4.14). The cure depth for a single scan vector can be determined by rearranging ( 4.29) to solve for Cd0. Cd0¼Cd1/C0DPlnEP=Emax ðÞ ¼3/C05:8/C3ln 1:1123ðÞ ¼2:383 mils From this calculation, it is evident that the cure depth of a single scan vector is 1.6 mils less than the desired layer thickness. Rounding up from 1.6 mils, we saythat the hatch overcure of this situation is /C02 mils. Recall that the hatch overcure is one of the variables that can be adjusted by the SL machine operator. This concludes the presentation of traditional vector scan VP.

These processes build complex shaped parts that are typically less than1 mm in size. They are referred to as Microstereolithography (MSL), IntegratedHardened Stereolithography (IH), LIGA [ 42], Deep X-ray Lithography (DXRL), and other names. In this section, we will focus on those processes that utilize UV radiation to directly process photopolymer materials. In contrast to convention VP, vector scan technologies for the microscale typically have moved the vat in x,y, and zdirections, rather than scanning the laser beam. To focus a typical laser to spot sizes less than 20 μm requires the laser’s focal length to be very short, causing difﬁculties for scanning the laser. For anSLA-250 with a 325 nm wavelength HeCd laser, the beam has a diameter of0.33 mm and a divergence of 1.25 mrad as it exits the laser. It propagates 280 mm then encounters a diverging lens (focal length /C025 mm) and a converging lens (focal length 100 mm) which is 85 mm away. Using simple thin-lensapproximations, the distance from the converging lens to the focal point, wherethe laser reaches a spot size of 0.2 mm is 940 mm and its Rayleigh range is 72 mm.Hence, the focused laser spot is a long distance from the focusing optics and theRayleigh range is long enough to enable a wide scanning region and a largebuild area. In contrast, a typical calculation is presented here for a high-resolution micro-SL system with a laser spot size of 10 μm. A 325 nm wavelength HeCd laser used in SL is included here to give the reader an idea of the challenge. The beam, as it exits thelaser, has a diameter of 0.33 mm and a divergence of 1.25 mrad. It propagates280 mm then encounters a diverging lens (focal length /C025 mm) and a converging lens (focal length 36.55 mm). The distance from the converging lens to the focalpoint is 54.3 mm and its Rayleigh range is only 0.24 mm. It would be very difﬁcultto scan this laser beam across a vat without severe spot distortions. Scanning micro-VP systems have been presented in literature since 1993 with the introduction of the Integrated Hardening method of Ikuta and Hirowatari [43]. They used a laser spot focused to a 5- μm diameter and the resin vat is scanned underneath it to cure a layer. Examples of devices built with this method includetubes, manifolds, and springs and ﬂexible microactuators [ 44] and ﬂuid channels on silicon [ 45]. Takagi and Nakajima [ 46] have demonstrated the use of this technol- ogy for connecting MEMS gears together on a substrate. The artifact fabricatedusing micro-VP can be used as a mold for subsequent electroplating followed byremoval of the resin [ 47]. This method has been able to achieve sub-1 μm minimum feature size.94 4 Vat Photopolymerization ProcessesThe following speciﬁcations of a typical point-wise microstereolithography process have been presented in [ 48]: •5 -μm spot size of the UV beam Positional accuracy is 0.25 μm (in the x–ydirections) and 1.0 μmi nt h e z- direction Minimum size of the unit of hardened polymer is 5 μm/C25μm/C23μm (in x,y,z) Maximum size of fabrication structure is 10 mm /C210 mm /C210 mm The capability of building around inserted components has also been proposed for components such as ultraﬁltration membranes and electrical conductors. Applications include ﬂuid chips for protein synthesis [ 49] and bioanalysis [50]. The bioanalysis system was constructed with integrated valves and pumps that include a stacked modular design, 13 /C213 mm2and 3 mm thick, each of which has a different ﬂuid function. However, the full extent of integrated processing onsilicon has not yet been demonstrated. The beneﬁts of greater design ﬂexibility andlower cost of fabrication may be realized in the future. 4.9 Mask Projection VP Technologies and Processes Technologies to project bitmaps onto a resin surface to cure a layer at a time wereﬁrst developed in the early 1990s by researchers who wanted to develop special VPmachines to fabricate microscale parts. Several groups in Japan and Europe pursuedwhat was called mask projection stereolithography technology at that time. Themain advantage of mask projection methods is speed: since an entire part crosssection can be cured at one time, it can be faster than scanning a laser beam.Dynamic masks can be realized by LCD screens, by spatial light modulators, or byDMDs, such as the Digital Light Processing (DLP ™) chips manufactured by Texas Instruments [ 51]. 4.9.1 Mask Projection VP Technology Mask projection VP (MPVP) systems have been realized by several groups around the world. Some of the earlier systems utilized LCD displays as their dynamic mask[52,53], while another early system used a spatial light modulator [ 54]. The remaining systems all used DMDs as their dynamic masks [ 55–58]. These latest systems all use UV lamps as their radiation source, while others have used lamps in the visible range [ 55] or lasers in the UV. A good overview of micro-VP technol- ogy, systems, and applications is the book by Varadan et al. [ 59]. Microscale VP has been commercialized by MicroTEC GmbH, Germany. Although machines are not for sale, the company offers customer-speciﬁc services.The company has developed machines based on point-wise as well as layer-wisephotopolymerization principles. Their Rapid Micro Product Development (RMPD)4.9 Mask Projection VP Technologies and Processes 95machines using a He–Cd laser enable construction of small parts layer-by-layer (as thin as 1 μm) with a high surface quality in the subnanometer range and with a feature deﬁnition of <10μm. A schematic and photograph of a MPVP system from Georgia Tech is shown in Fig.4.15. Similar to conventional SL, the MPVP process starts with the CAD model of the part, which is then sliced at various heights. Each resulting slice cross section is stored as bitmaps to be displayed on the dynamic mask. UV radiation reﬂects off of the “on” micromirrors and is imaged onto the resin surface to cure a layer. In thesystem at Georgia Tech, a broadband UV lamp is the light source, a DMD is thedynamic mask, and an automated XYZ stage is used to translate the vat of resin inthree dimensions. Standard VP resins are typically used, although other researchgroups formulate their own. 4.9.2 Commercial MPVP Systems Several companies market VP systems based on mask projection technology,including EnvisionTec and 3D Systems. New companies in Europe and Asia havealso started recently to market MPVP systems. Broadband UV lampPinholeFilter Collimating lens Imaging lens Resin vatTranslation stageDigital Micromirror Device computerBitmaps UV Lamp Optics Vat Location Controller Translation StagesDMD Fig. 4.15 Schematic and photo of mask projection VP machine96 4 Vat Photopolymerization ProcessesEnvisionTEC ﬁrst marketed their MPVP systems in 2003. They now have several lines of machines with various build envelopes and resolutions based onthe MPVP process, including the Perfactory, Perfactory Desktop, Aureus, Xede/ Xtreme, and Ultra. Variants of some of these models are available, including specialized Perfactory machines for dental restorations or for hearing aid shells.A photo of the Perfactory Standard machine is shown in Fig. 4.16 and its technical speciﬁcations are listed in Table 4.3. Schematically, their machines are very similar to the Georgia Tech machine in Fig.4.15 and utilize a lamp for illuminating the DMD and vat. However, several of their machine models have a very important difference: they build parts upsidedown and do not use a recoating mechanism. The vat is illuminated vertically upwards through a clear window. After the system irradiates a layer, the cured resin sticks to the window and cures into the previous layer. The build platform pullsaway from the window at a slight angle to gently separate the part from the window.The advantage of this approach is threefold. First, no separate recoating mechanismis needed since gravity forces the resin to ﬁll in the region between the cured partand the window. Second, the top vat surface being irradiated is a ﬂat window, not afree surface, enabling more precise layers to be fabricated. Third, they have deviseda build process that eliminates a regular vat. Instead, they have a supply-on-demand Fig. 4.16 EnvisionTEC Perfactory model Table 4.3 Specifications on EnvisionTEC Perfactory Standard Zoom machineLens system f¼25–45 mm Build envelope Standard 190 /C2142/C2230 mm High-resolution 120 /C290/C2230 mm Pixel size Standard 86–136 μm High-resolution 43–68 μm Layer thickness 25–150 mm4.9 Mask Projection VP Technologies and Processes 97material feed system. The disadvantage is that small or ﬁne features may be damaged when the cured layer is separated from the window. 3D Systems introduced their V-Flash machine in 2008. It utilizes MPVP tech- nology and a novel material handling approach [ 60]. The V-Flash was intended to be an inexpensive prototyping machine (under $10,000) that was as easy to use as atypical home ink-jet printer. Its build envelope was 230 /C2170/C2200 mm (9/C27/C28 in.). During operation, parts were built upside down. For each layer, a blade coated a layer of resin onto a ﬁlm that spanned the build chamber. The buildplatform slid down until the platform or the in-process part contacted the resin layerand ﬁlm. A cartridge provided a supply of unused ﬁlm for each layer. That layerwas cured by the machine’s “UV Imager,” which consisted of the MPVP technol- ogy. Some rinsing of the part was required, similar to SL, and support structures may have to be removed during the post-processing phase of part fabrication. 4.9.3 MPVP Modeling Most of the research presented on MPVP technology is experimental. As in SL, it ispossible to develop good predictive models of curing for MPVP systems. Broadly speaking, models of the MPVP process can be described by a model that determines the irradiation of the vat surface and its propagation into the resin, followed by amodel that determines how the resin reacts to that irradiation. Schematically, theMPVP model can be given by Fig. 4.17, showing an Irradiance Model and a Cure Model. As a given bitmap pattern is displayed, the resin imaged by the “on” mirrors is irradiated. The exposure received by the resin is simply the product of the irradi-ance and the time of exposure. The dimensional accuracy of an imaged part cross Incident beam characteristics Imaging system parameters Bitmap displayed on DMD Lateral dimensions of the cured layerLayer thickness Time of exposureIrradiance received by everypoint on resinsurfaceIRRADIANCE MODEL CURE MODEL Fig. 4.17 Model of the MPVP process98 4 Vat Photopolymerization Processessection is a function of the radiation uniformity across the DMD, the collimation of the beam, and the capability of the optics system in delivering an undistorted image. If the MPVP machine’s optical system produces a plane wave that is neither converging nor diverging, then it is easy to project rays from the DMD to the resin surface. The irradiance model in this case is very straightforward. However, in mostpractical cases, it is necessary to model the cone of rays that project from eachmicromirror on the DMD to the resin. As a result, a point on the resin may receiveradiation from several micromirrors. Standard ray-tracing methods can be used tocompute the irradiance ﬁeld that results from a bitmap [ 61]. After computing the irradiance distribution on the vat surface, the cured shape can be predicted. The depth of cure can be computed in a manner similar to that used in Sect. 4.5. Cure depth is computed as the product of the resin’s D pvalue and the exponential of the exposure received divided by the resin’s Ecvalue, as in (4.15). The exposure received is simply the product of the irradiance at a point and the time of exposure, T. Cd¼DPe/C0E=Ec¼DPe/C0H/C1T=Ecð4:30Þ In the build direction, overcure and print-through errors are evident, as in SL. In principle, however, it is easier to correct for these errors than in point-wise SLsystems. A method called the “Compensation Zone” approach was developed tocompensate for this unwanted curing [ 61]. A tailored volume (Compensation Zone) is subtracted from underneath the CAD model to compensate for the increase in the Z dimension that would occur due to print-through. Using this method, more accurate parts and better surface ﬁnish can be achieved. 4.10 Two-Photon Vat Photopolymerization In the two-photon vat photopolymerization (2p-VP) process, the photoinitiatorrequires two photons to strike it before it decomposes to form a free radical that can initiate polymerization. The effect of this two-photon requirement is to greatly increase the resolution of photopolymerization processes. This is true since onlynear the center of the laser is the irradiance high enough to provide the photondensity necessary to ensure that two photons will strike the same photoinitiatormolecule. Feature sizes of 0.2 μm or smaller have been achieved using 2p-VP. 2p-VP was ﬁrst invented in the 1970s for the purposes of fabricated three- dimensional parts [ 62]. Interestingly, this predates the development of stereolithography by over 10 years. In this approach, two lasers were used to irradiate points in a vat of photopolymer. When the focused laser spots intersected, the photon density was high enough for photopolymerization. More recently, 2p-VP received research attention in the late 1990s. A schematic of a typical research setup for this process is shown in Fig. 4.18[63]. In this system, they used a high-power Ti:Sapphire laser, with wavelength 790 nm, pulse-width200 fs, and peak power 50 kW. The objective lens had an NA ¼0.85. Similarly to4.10 Two-Photon Vat Photopolymerization 99other micro-VP approaches, the vat was scanned by a 3D scanning stage, not the laser beam. Parts were built from the bottom up. The viscosity of the resin was enough to prevent the micropart being cured from ﬂoating away. Complicated parts have been produced quickly by various research groups. For example, the micro- bull in Fig. 4.19was produced in 13 min [ 64]. The shell of the micro-bull was cured by 2p-VP, while the interior was cured by ﬂood exposure to UV light. Typical photopolymer materials can be used in 2p-VP machines [ 64–66]. The most commonly used resin was SCR500 from Japan Synthetic Rubber Company, which was a common SL resin in Japan, where this research started during the 1990s. SCR500 is a mixture of urethane acrylate oligomers/monomers and common free-radical generating photoinitiators. The absorption spectrum of the resin shows that it is transparent beyond 550 nm, which is a signiﬁcant advantage since photons can penetrate the resin to a great depth ( Dpis very large).

The size scale bar is 1 μm100 4 Vat Photopolymerization Processesparts can be built inside the resin vat, not just at the vat surface, which eliminates the need for recoating. Photosensitivity of a 2p-VP resin is measured in terms of the two-photon absorption cross section ( Δ) of the initiator molecule corresponding to the wave- length used to irradiate it. The larger the value of Δ, the more sensitive is the resin to two-photon polymerization, possibly enabling lower power lasers. Acrylate photopolymer systems exhibit low photosensitivity as the initiators have small two-photon absorption cross sections. Consequently, these initiatorsrequire high-laser power and longer exposure times. Other materials have beeninvestigated for 2p-VP, speciﬁcally using initiators with larger Δ. New types of photoinitiators tend to be long molecules with certain patterns that make them particularly good candidates for decomposing into free radicals if two photons strike it in rapid succession [ 67]. By tuning the design of the photoinitiators, large absorption cross sections and low-polymerization threshold energies can beachieved [ 68]. 4.11 Process Benefits and Drawbacks Two of the main advantages of vat photopolymerization technology over other AM technologies are part accuracy and surface ﬁnish. These characteristics led to thewidespread usage of vector scan stereolithography parts as form, ﬁt, and, to a lesserextent, functional prototypes as the rapid prototyping ﬁeld developed. Typical dimensional accuracies for SL machines are often quoted as a ratio of an error per unit length. For example, accuracy of an SLA-250 is typically quoted as0.002 in./in. Modern SL machines are somewhat more accurate. Surface ﬁnish ofSL parts ranges from submicron Ra for upfacing surfaces to over 100 μm Ra for surfaces at slanted angles. Another advantage of VP technologies is their ﬂexibility, supporting many different machine conﬁgurations and size scales. Different light sources can beused, including lasers, lamps, or LEDs, as well as different pattern generators, such as scanning galvanometers or DMDs. The size range that has been demonstrated with VP technologies is vast: from the 1.5 m vat in the iPro 9000XL SLA Center tothe 100 nm features possible with 2-photon photopolymerization. Mask projection VP technologies have an inherent speed advantage over laser scan SL. By utilizing a mask, an entire part cross section can be projected, ratherthan having to sequentially scan the vector pattern for the cross section. There is atrade-off between resolution and the size of the pattern (and size of the solidiﬁedcross section) due to the mask resolution. For example, typical DMDs have 1,024 /C2780 or 1,280 /C2720 resolution, although newer HDTV DMDs have resolutions of 1,920 /C21,080. Nonetheless, for fabricated part resolution of 50 μm or better, the projected area can be a maximum of 96 /C254 mm. A drawback of VP processes is their usage of photopolymers, since the chemistries are limited to acrylates and epoxies for commercial materials. Althoughquite a few other material systems are photopolymerizable, none have emerged as4.11 Process Benefits and Drawbacks 101commercial successes to displace the current chemistries. Generally, the current SL materials do not have the impact strength and durability of good quality injectionmolded thermoplastics. Additionally, they are known to age, resulting in degraded mechanical properties over time. These limitations prevent SL processes from being used for many production applications. 4.12 Summary Photopolymerization processes make use of liquid, radiation-curable resins calledphotopolymers to fabricate parts. Upon irradiation, these materials undergo achemical reaction to become solid. Several methods of illuminating photopolymers for part fabrication were presented, including vector scan point-wise processing, mask projection layer-wise processing, and two-photon approaches. The vectorscan approach is used with UV lasers in the VP process, while DLP micromirrorarray chips are commonly used for mask projection technologies. Two-photonapproaches, which have the highest resolution, remain of research interest only.Advantages, disadvantages, and unique characteristics of these approaches weresummarized. Photopolymerization processes lend themselves to accurate analytical modeling due to the well-deﬁned interactions between radiation and photopolymers. An extensive model for laser scan VP was presented, while a simpler one for MPVPwas summarized. Discretization errors and scan patterns were covered in thischapter to convey a better understanding of these concepts as they apply tophotopolymerization processes, as well as many of the processes still to bepresented in this book. 4.13 Exercises Explain why VP is a good process to use to fabricate patterns for investment casting of metal parts (0.5 page+).

Developed at the University of Texas at Austin, USA, selective laser sintering (SLS) was the ﬁrst commercialized PBF process. Its basic method of operation is schematically shown in Fig. 5.1, and all other PBF processes modify this basic approach in one or more ways to enhance machine productivity, enabledifferent materials to be processed, and/or to avoid speciﬁc patented features. All PBF processes share a basic set of characteristics. These include one or more thermal sources for inducing fusion between powder particles, a method forcontrolling powder fusion to a prescribed region of each layer, and mechanismsfor adding and smoothing powder layers. The most common thermal sources for PBF are lasers. PBF processes which utilize lasers are known as laser sintering (LS) machines. Since polymer laser sintering (pLS) machines and metal lasersintering (mLS) machines are signiﬁcantly different from each other, we willaddress each separately. In addition, as electron beam and other thermal sourcesrequire signiﬁcantly different machine architectures than laser sintering machines,non-laser thermal sources will be addressed separately from laser sources at the endof the chapter. LS processes were originally developed to produce plastic prototypes using a point-wise laser scanning technique. This approach was subsequently extended to metal and ceramic powders; additional thermal sources are now utilized; andvariants for layer-wise fusion of powdered materials are being commerciallyintroduced. As a result, PBF processes are widely used worldwide, have a broadrange of materials (including polymers, metals, ceramics, and composites) whichcan be utilized, and are increasingly being used for direct manufacturing of end-useproducts, as the material properties are comparable to many engineering-gradepolymers, metals, and ceramics. In order to provide a baseline description of powder fusion processes, pLS will be described as the paradigm approach to which the other PBF processes will be #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_5107compared. As shown in Fig. 5.1, pLS fuses thin layers of powder (typically 0.075– 0.1 mm thick) which have been spread across the build area using a counter-rotatingpowder leveling roller. The part building process takes place inside an enclosedchamber ﬁlled with nitrogen gas to minimize oxidation and degradation of thepowdered material. The powder in the build platform is maintained at an elevated temperature just below the melting point and/or glass transition temperature of the powdered material. Infrared heaters are placed above the build platform to maintainan elevated temperature around the part being formed, as well as above the feedcartridges to preheat the powder prior to spreading over the build area. In somecases, the build platform is also heated using resistive heaters around the buildplatform. This preheating of powder and maintenance of an elevated, uniformtemperature within the build platform is necessary to minimize the laser powerrequirements of the process (with preheating, less laser energy is required for fusion) and to prevent warping of the part during the build due to nonuniform thermal expansion and contraction (resulting in curling). Once an appropriate powder layer has been formed and preheated, a focused CO 2laser beam is directed onto the powder bed and is moved using galvanometers in such a way that it thermally fuses the material to form the slice cross section.Surrounding powder remains loose and serves as support for subsequent layers, thuseliminating the need for the secondary supports which are necessary for vatphotopolymerization processes. After completing a layer, the build platform is lowered by one layer thickness and a new layer of powder is laid and leveled using the counter-rotating roller. The beam scans the subsequent slice cross section.This process repeats until the complete part is built. A cool-down period is typically Fig. 5.1 Schematic of the selective laser sintering process108 5 Powder Bed Fusion Processesrequired to allow the parts to uniformly come to a low-enough temperature that they can be handled and exposed to ambient temperature and atmosphere. If the partsand/or powder bed are prematurely exposed to ambient temperature and atmo- sphere, the powders may degrade in the presence of oxygen and parts may warp due to uneven thermal contraction. Finally, the parts are removed from the powder bed,loose powder is cleaned off the parts, and further ﬁnishing operations, if necessary,are performed. 5.2 Materials In principle, all materials that can be melted and resolidiﬁed can be used in PBFprocesses. A brief survey of materials processed using PBF processes will be given here. More details can be found in subsequent sections. 5.2.1 Polymers and Composites Thermoplastic materials are well-suited for powder bed processing because of their relatively low melting temperatures, low thermal conductivities, and low tendencyfor balling. Polymers in general can be classiﬁed as either a thermoplastic or athermoset polymer. Thermoset polymers are typically not processed using PBF intoparts, since PBF typically operates by melting particles to fabricate part cross sections, but thermosets degrade, but do not melt, as their temperature is increased. Thermoplastics can be classiﬁed further in terms of their crystallinity. Amorphouspolymers have a random molecular structure, with polymer chains randomlyintertwined. In contrast, crystalline polymers have a regular molecular structure,but this is uncommon. Much more common are semi-crystalline polymers whichhave regions of regular structure, called crystallites. Amorphous polymers meltover a fairly wide range of temperatures. As the crystallinity of a polymer increases,however, its melting characteristics tend to become more centered around a well deﬁned melting point. At present, the most common material used in PBF is polyamide, a thermoplastic polymer, commonly known in the US as nylon. Most polyamides have fairly highcrystallinity and are classiﬁed as semi-crystalline materials. They have distinctmelting points that enable them to be processed reliably. A given amount of laserenergy will melt a certain amount of powder; the melted powder fuses and coolsquickly, forming part of a cross section. In contrast, amorphous polymers tend tosoften and melt over a broad temperature range and not form well deﬁned solidiﬁed features. In pLS, amorphous polymers tend to sinter into highly porous shapes, whereas crystalline polymers are typically processed using full melting, whichresult in higher densities. Polyamide 11 and polyamide 12 are commerciallyavailable, where the number designates the number of carbon atoms that areprovided by one of the monomers that is reacted to produce polyamide. However,crystalline polymers exhibit greater shrinkage compared to amorphous materials5.2 Materials 109and are more susceptible to curling and distortion and thus require more uniform temperature control. Mechanical properties of pLS parts produced using polyamidepowders approach those of injection molded thermoplastic parts, but with signiﬁ- cantly reduced elongation and unique microstructures. Polystyrene-based materials with low residual ash content are particularly suit- able for making sacriﬁcial patterns for investment casting using pLS. Interestingly,polystyrene is an amorphous polymer, but is a successful example material due toits intended application. Porosity in an investment casting pattern aids in meltingout the pattern after the ceramic shell is created. Polystyrene parts intended forprecision investment casting applications should be sealed to prevent ceramicmaterial seeping in and to achieve a smooth surface ﬁnish. Elastomeric thermoplastic polymers are available for producing highly ﬂexible parts with rubber-like characteristics. These elastomers have good resistance todegradation at elevated temperatures and are resistant to chemicals like gasolineand automotive coolants. Elastomeric materials can be used to produce gaskets,industrial seals, shoe soles, and other components. Additional polymers that are commercially available include ﬂame-retardant polyamide and polyaryletherketone (known as PAEK or PEEK). Both 3D Systemsand EOS GmbH offer most of the materials listed in this section. Researchers have investigated quite a few polymers for biomedical applications. Several types of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers have been processedusing pLS, including polycaprolactone (PCL), polylactide (PLA), and poly- L- lactide (PLLA). Composite materials consisting of PCL and ceramic particles,including hydroxyapatite and calcium silicate, have also been investigated for thefabrication of bone replacement tissue scaffolds. In addition to neat polymers, polymers in PBF can have ﬁllers that enhance their mechanical properties. For example, the Duraform material from 3D Systems is offered as Duraform PA, which is polyamide 12, as well as Duraform GF, which is polyamide 12 ﬁlled with small glass beads. The glass additive enhances thematerial’s stiffness signiﬁcantly, but also causes its ductility to be reduced, com-pared to polyamide materials without ﬁllers. Additionally, EOS GmbH offersaluminum particle, carbon ﬁber, and their own glass bead ﬁlled polyamidematerials. 5.2.2 Metals and Composites A wide range of metals has been processed using PBF. Generally, any metal thatcan be welded is considered to be a good candidate for PBF processing. Several types of steels, typically stainless and tool steels, titanium and its alloys, nickel-base alloys, some aluminum alloys, and cobalt-chrome have been processed and arecommercially available in some form. Additionally, some companies now offerPBF of precious metals, such as silver and gold. Historically, a number of proprietary metal powders (either thermoplastic binder-coated or binder mixed) were developed before modern mLS machines110 5 Powder Bed Fusion Processeswere available. RapidSteel was one of the ﬁrst metal/binder systems, developed by DTM Corp. The ﬁrst version of RapidSteel was available in 1996 and consisted of athermoplastic binder coated 1080 carbon steel powder with copper as the inﬁltrant. Parts produced using RapidSteel were debinded (350–450 /C14C), sintered (around 1,000/C14C), and ﬁnally inﬁltrated with Cu (1,120/C14C) to produce a ﬁnal part with approximately 60 % low carbon steel and 40 % Cu. This is an example of liquidphase sintering which will be described in the next section. Subsequently,RapidSteel 2.0 powder was introduced in 1998 for producing functional tooling,parts, and mold inserts for injection molding. It was a dry blend of 316 stainlesssteel powder impact milled with thermoplastic and thermoset organic binders withan average particle size of 33 μm. After green part fabrication, the part was debinded and sintered in a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. The bronze inﬁltrant was introduced in a separate furnace run to produce a 50 % steel and 50 % bronzecomposite. RapidSteel 2.0 was structurally more stable than the original RapidSteelmaterial because the bronze inﬁltration temperature was less than the sinteringtemperature of the stainless steel powder. A subsequent material development wasLaserForm ST-100, which had a broader particle size range, with ﬁne particles notbeing screened out. These ﬁne particles allowed ST-100 particles to be furnacesintered at a lower temperature than RapidSteel 2.0, making it possible to carry out sintering and inﬁltration in a single furnace run. In addition to the above, H13 and A6 tool steel powders with a polymer binder can also be used for toolingapplications. The furnace processing operations (sintering and inﬁltration) mustbe carefully designed with appropriate choices of temperature, heating and coolingrates, furnace atmosphere pressure, amount of inﬁltrant, and other factors, toprevent excessive part distortion. After inﬁltration, the part is ﬁnish machined asneeded. These issues are further explored in the post-processing chapter. Several proprietary metal powders were marketed by EOS for their M250 Xtended metal platforms, prior to the introduction of modern mLS machines. These included liquid-phase sintered bronze-based powders, and steel-basedpowders and other proprietary alloys (all without polymer binders). These weresuitable for producing tools and inserts for injection molding of plastics. Parts madefrom these powders were often inﬁltrated with epoxy to improve the surface ﬁnishand seal porosity in the parts. Proprietary nickel-based powders for direct toolingapplications and Cu-based powders for parts requiring high thermal and electricalconductivities were also available. All of these materials have been successfully used by many organizations; however, the more recent introduction of mLS and electron beam melting (EBM) technology has made these alloys obsolete, asengineering-grade alloys are now able to be processed using a number ofmanufacturers’ machines. As mentioned, titanium alloys, numerous steel alloys, nickel-based super alloys, CoCrMo, and more are widely available from numerous manufacturers. It should benoted that alloys that crack under high solidiﬁcation rates are not good candidatesfor mLS. Due to the high solidiﬁcation rates in mLS, the crystal structures produced and mechanical properties are different than those for other manufacturing pro- cesses. These structures may be metastable, and the heat treatment recipes needed5.2 Materials 111to produce standard microstructures may be different. As mLS and EBM processes advance, the types of metal alloys which are commonly utilized will grow and newalloys speciﬁcally tailored for PBF production will be developed. 5.2.3 Ceramics and Ceramic Composites Ceramic materials are generally described as compounds that consist of metal-oxides, carbides, and nitrides and their combinations. Several ceramic materials areavailable commercially including aluminum oxide and titanium oxide. Commercialmachines were developed by a company called Phenix Systems in France, whichwas acquired by 3D Systems in 2013. 3D Systems also says it offers cermets, whichare metal-ceramic composites. Ceramics and metal-ceramic composites have been demonstrated in research. Typically, ceramic precipitates form through reactions occurring during the sintering process. One example is the processing of aluminum in a nitrogen atmosphere, which forms an aluminum matrix with small regions of AlNinterspersed throughout. This process is called chemically induced sintering andis described further in the next section. Biocompatible materials have been developed for speciﬁc applications. For example, calcium hydroxyapatite, a material very similar to human bone, hasbeen processed using pLS for medical applications. 5.3 Powder Fusion Mechanisms Since the introduction of LS, each new PBF technology developer has introducedcompeting terminology to describe the mechanism by which fusion occurs, withvariants of “sintering” and “melting” being the most popular. However, the use of asingle word to describe the powder fusion mechanism is inherently problematic asmultiple mechanisms are possible. There are four different fusion mechanismswhich are present in PBF processes [ 1]. These include solid-state sintering, chemi- cally induced binding, liquid-phase sintering (LPS), and full melting. Most com-mercial processes utilize primarily LPS and melting. A brief description of each of these mechanisms and their relevance to AM follows. 5.3.1 Solid-State Sintering The use of the word sintering to describe powder fusion as a result of thermal processing predates the advent of AM. Sintering, in its classical sense, indicates thefusion of powder particles without melting (i.e., in their “solid state”) at elevatedtemperatures. This occurs at temperatures between one half of the absolute meltingtemperature and the melting temperature. The driving force for solid-state sintering112 5 Powder Bed Fusion Processesis the minimization of total free energy, Es, of the powder particles. The mechanism for sintering is primarily diffusion between powder particles. Surface energy Esis proportional to total particle surface area SA, through the equation Es¼γs/C2SA(where γsis the surface energy per unit area for a particular material, atmosphere, and temperature). When particles fuse at elevated temperatures (see Fig. 5.2), the total surface area decreases, and thus surface energy decreases. As the total surface area of the powder bed decreases, the rate of sintering slows. To achieve very low porosity levels, long sintering times or high sinteringtemperatures are required. The use of external pressure, as is done with hot isostaticpressing, increases the rate of sintering. As total surface area in a powder bed is a function of particle size, the driving force for sintering is directly related to the surface area to volume ratio for a set of particles. The larger the surface area to volume ratio, the greater the free energy driving force. Thus, smaller particles experience a greater driving force for neckingand consolidation, and hence, smaller particles sinter more rapidly and initiatesintering at lower temperature than larger particles. As diffusion rates exponentially increase with temperature, sintering becomes increasingly rapid as temperatures approach the melting temperature, which can bemodeled using a form of the Arrhenius equation. However, even at temperaturesapproaching the melting temperature, diffusion-induced solid-state sintering is the slowest mechanism for selectively fusing regions of powder within a PBF process. For AM, the shorter the time it takes to form a layer, the more economically competitive the process becomes. Thus, the heat source which induces fusionshould move rapidly and/or induce fusion quickly to increase build rates. Sincethe time it takes for fusion by sintering is typically much longer than for fusion bymelting, few AM processes use sintering as a primary fusion mechanism.Unsintered particle PoreNeckIncreased Necking Decreased porosityab c Fig. 5.2 Solid-state sintering. ( a) Closely packed particles prior to sintering. ( b) Particles agglomerate at temperatures above one half of the absolute melting temperature, as they seek to minimize free energy by decreasing surface area. ( c) As sintering progresses, neck size increases and pore size decreases5.3 Powder Fusion Mechanisms 113Sintering, however, is still important in most thermal powder processes, even if sintering is not the primary fusion mechanism. There are three secondary ways inwhich sintering affects a build. If the loose powder within the build platform is held at an elevated temperature, the powder bed particles will begin to sinter to one another. This is typicallyconsidered a negative effect, as agglomeration of powder particles means thateach time the powder is recycled the average particle size increases. Thischanges the spreading and melting characteristics of the powder each time it isrecycled. One positive effect of loose powder sintering, however, is that thepowder bed will gain a degree of tensile and compressive strength, thus helping to minimize part curling. As a part is being formed in the build platform, thermally induced fusing of the desired cross-sectional geometry causes that region of the powder bed to becomemuch hotter than the surrounding loose powder. If melting is the dominantfusion mechanism (as is typically the case) then the just-formed part crosssection will be quite hot. As a result, the loose powder bed immediatelysurrounding the fused region heats up considerably, due to conduction fromthe part being formed. This region of powder may remain at an elevated temperature for a long time (many hours) depending upon the size of the part being built, the heater and temperature settings in the process, and the thermalconductivity of the powder bed. Thus, there is sufﬁcient time and energy for thepowder immediately next to the part being built to fuse signiﬁcantly due to solid-state sintering, both to itself and to the part. This results in “part growth,” wherethe originally scanned part grows a “skin” of increasing thickness the longer thepowder bed is maintained at an elevated temperature. This phenomenon can beseen in Fig. 5.3as unmolten particles fused to the edge of a part. For many materials, the skin formed on the part goes from high density, low porosity near the originally scanned region to lower density, higher porosity further from thepart. This part growth can be compensated in the build planning stage byoffsetting the laser beam to compensate for part growth or by offsetting thesurface of the STL model. In addition, different post-processing methods willremove this skin to a different degree. Thus, the dimensional repeatability of theﬁnal part is highly dependent upon effectively compensating for and controllingthis part growth. Performing repeatable post-processing to remove the same amount of the skin for every part is thus quite important. Rapid fusion of a powder bed using a laser or other heat source makes it difﬁcult to achieve 100 % dense, porosity-free parts. Thus, a feature of many parts builtusing PBF techniques (especially for polymers) is distributed porosity through-out the part. This is typically detrimental to the intended part properties. How-ever, if the part is held at an elevated temperature after scanning, solid-statesintering combined with other high-temperature phenomena (such as graingrowth in metals) causes the % porosity in the part to decrease. Since lower layers are maintained at an elevated temperature while additional layers are added, this can result in lower regions of a part being denser than upper regions114 5 Powder Bed Fusion Processesof a part. This uneven porosity can be controlled, to some extent, by carefully controlling the part bed temperature, cooling rate and other parameters. EBM, inparticular, often makes use of the positive aspects of elevated-temperature solid-state sintering and grain growth by purposefully maintaining the metal parts thatare being built at a high enough temperature that diffusion and grain growthcause the parts being built to reach 100 % density. 5.3.2 Chemically Induced Sintering Chemically induced sintering involves the use of thermally activated chemicalreactions between two types of powders or between powders and atmosphericgases to form a by-product which binds the powders together. This fusion mecha-nism is primarily utilized for ceramic materials. Examples of reactions betweenpowders and atmospheric gases include: laser processing of SiC in the presence ofoxygen, whereby SiO 2forms and binds together a composite of SiC and SiO 2; laser processing of ZrB 2in the presence of oxygen, whereby ZrO 2forms and binds together a composite of ZrB 2and ZrO 2; and laser processing of Al in the presence of N 2, whereby AlN forms and binds together the Al and AlN particles. For chemically induced sintering between powders, various research groups have demonstrated that mixtures of high-temperature structural ceramic and/orintermetallic precursor materials can be made to react using a laser. In this case,raw materials which exothermically react to form the desired by-product are Unmolten particle fused toedge Spherulite from fully melted &crystallisedparticle Spherulite from melted &crystallisedregion100 µmUnmolten particle core Fig. 5.3 Typical pLS microstructure for nylon polyamide (Materials Science & Engineering.

By adding chemical reaction energy to the laser energy, high-melting-temperature structures can be created at relatively low laserenergies. One common characteristic of chemically induced sintering is part porosity. As a result, post-process inﬁltration or high-temperature furnace sintering to higherdensities is often needed to achieve properties that are useful for most applications.This post-process inﬁltration may involve other reactive elements, forming newchemical compounds after inﬁltration. The cost and time associated with post-processing have limited the adoption of chemically induced sintering in commer-cial machines. 5.3.3 LPS and Partial Melting LPS is arguably the most versatile mechanism for PBF. LPS is a term usedextensively in the powder processing industry to refer to the fusion of powderparticles when a portion of constituents within a collection of powder particlesbecome molten, while other portions remain solid. In LPS, the molten constituentsact as the glue which binds the solid particles together. As a result, high-temperature particles can be bound together without needing to melt or sinter those particles directly. LPS is used in traditional powder metallurgy to form, for instance, cemented carbide cutting tools where Co is used as the lower-melting-point constituent to glue together particles of WC. There are many ways in which LPS can be utilized as a fusion mechanism in AM processes. For purposes of clarity, the classiﬁcation proposed by Kruth et al. [ 1] has formed the basis for the distinctions discussed in the following section and shown inFig.5.4. 5.3.3.1 Distinct Binder and Structural Materials In many LPS situations, there is a clear distinction between the binding material and the structural material. The binding and structural material can be combined inthree different ways: as separate particles, as composite particles, or as coatedparticles. Separate Particles A simple, well-mixed combination of binder and structural powder particles issufﬁcient in many cases for LPS. In cases where the structural material has thedominant properties desired in the ﬁnal structure, it is advantageous for the bindermaterial to be smaller in particle size than the structural material. This enables more efﬁcient packing in the powder bed and less shrinkage and lower porosity after binding. The dispersion of smaller-particle-size binder particles around structuralparticles also helps the binder ﬂow into the gaps between the structural particlesmore effectively, thus resulting in better binding of the structural particles. This isoften true when, for instance, LS is used to process steel powder with a polymerbinder (as discussed more fully in Sect. 5.3.5 ). This is also true when metal-metal116 5 Powder Bed Fusion Processesmixtures and metal-ceramic mixtures are directly processed without the use of a polymer binder. In the case of LPS of separate particles, the heat source passes by quickly, and there is typically insufﬁcient time for the molten binder to ﬂow and surface tensionto draw the particles together prior to resolidiﬁcation of the binder unless the binder has a particularly low viscosity. Thus, composite structures formed from separate particles typically are quite porous. This is often the intent for parts made fromseparate particles, which are then post-processed in a furnace to achieve the ﬁnal a b dc Binder Structural materialCross-section of coated particles Fig. 5.4 Liquid phase sintering variations used in powder bed fusion processing: ( a) separate particles, ( b) composite particles, ( c) coated particles, and ( d) indistinct mixtures. Darker regions represent the lower-melting-temperature binder material. Lighter regions represent the high- melting-temperature structural material. For indistinct mixtures, microstructural alloyingeliminates distinct binder and structural regions5.3 Powder Fusion Mechanisms 117part properties. Parts held together by polymer binders which require further post- processing (e.g., to lower or ﬁll the porosity) are termed as “green” parts. In some cases, the density of the binder and structural material are quite different. As a result, the binder and structural material may separate during handling. In addition, some powdered materials are most economicallymanufactured at particle sizes that are too small for effective powder dispensingand leveling (see Sect. 5.5). In either case, it may be beneﬁcial for the structural and/or binder particles to be bound together into larger particle agglomerates. Bydoing so, composite powder particles made up of both binder and structuralmaterial are formed. Composite Particles Composite particles contain both the binder and structural material within each powder particle. Mechanical alloying of binder and structural particles or grinding of cast, extruded or molded mixtures into a powder results in powder particles thatare made up of binder and structural materials agglomerated together. The beneﬁtsof composite particles are that they typically form higher density green parts andtypically have better surface ﬁnish after processing than separate particles [ 1]. Composite particles can consist of mixtures of polymer binders with higher melting point polymer, metal, or ceramic structural materials; or metal binders withhigher melting point metal or ceramic structural materials. In all cases, the binder and structural portions of each particle, if viewed under a microscope, are distinct from each other and clearly discernable. The most common commercially availablecomposite particle used in PBF processes is glass-ﬁlled nylon. In this case, thestructural material (glass beads) is used to enhance the properties of the bindingmaterial (nylon) rather than the typical use of LPS where the binder is simply anecessary glue to help hold the structural material together in a usefulgeometric form. Coated Particles In some cases, a composite formed by coating structural particles with a binder material is more effective than random agglomerations of binder and structural materials. These coated particles can have several advantages; including betterabsorption of laser energy, more effective binding of the structural particles, andbetter ﬂow properties. When composite particles or separate particles are processed, the random distri- bution of the constituents means that impinging heat energy, such as laser radiation,will be absorbed by whichever constituent has the highest absorptivity and/or mostdirect “line-of-sight” to the impinging energy. If the structural materials have a higher absorptivity, a greater amount of energy will be absorbed in the structural particles. If the rate of heating of the structural particles signiﬁcantly exceeds therate of conduction to the binder particles, the higher-melting-temperature structuralmaterials may melt prior to the lower-melting-temperature binder materials. As aresult, the anticipated microstructure of the processed material will differ signiﬁ-cantly from one where the binder had melted and the structural material had118 5 Powder Bed Fusion Processesremained solid. This may, in some instances, be desirable, but is typically not the intent when formulating a binder/structural material combination. Coated particlescan help overcome the structural material heating problem associated with random constituent mixtures and agglomerates. If a structural particle is coated with the binder material then the impinging energy must ﬁrst pass through the coating beforeaffecting the structural material. As melting of the binder and not the structuralmaterial is the objective of LPS, this helps ensure that the proper constituent melts. Other beneﬁts of coated particles exist. Since there is a direct correlation between the speed of the impinging energy in AM processing and the build rate,it is desirable for the binder to be molten for only a very short period of time. If thebinder is present at the surfaces of the structural material, this is the most effective location for gluing adjacent particles together. If the binder is randomly mixed with the structural materials, and/or the binder’s viscosity is too high to ﬂow to thecontact points during the short time it is molten, then the binder will not be aseffective. As a result, the binder % content required for effective fusion of coatedparticles is usually less than the binder content required for effective fusion ofrandomly mixed particles. Many structural metal powders are spherical. Spherical powders are easier to deposit and smooth using powder spreading techniques. Coated particles retain the spherical nature of the underlying particle shape, and thus can be easier to handle and spread. 5.3.3.2 Indistinct Binder and Structural Materials In polymers, due to their low thermal conductivity, it is possible to melt smallerpowder particles and the outer regions of larger powder particles without meltingthe entire structure (see Fig. 5.3). Whether to more properly label this phenomenon LPS or just “partial melting” is a matter of debate. Also with polymers, fusion can occur between polymer particles above their glass transition temperature, but belowtheir melting temperature. Similarly, amorphous polymers have no distinct meltingpoint, becoming less viscous the higher the temperature goes above the glasstransition temperature. As a result, in each of these cases, there can be fusionbetween polymer powder particles in cases where there is partial but not fullmelting, which falls within the historical scope of the term “liquid phase sintering.” In metals, LPS can occur between particles where no distinct binder or structural materials are present. This is possible during partial melting of a single particle type, or when an alloyed structure has lower-melting-temperature constituents. Fornoneutectic alloy compositions, melting occurs between the liquidus and solidustemperature of the alloy, where only a portion of the alloy will melt when thetemperature is maintained in this range. Regions of the alloy with higherconcentrations of the lower-melting-temperature constituent(s) will melt ﬁrst. Asa result, it is commonly observed that many metal alloys can be processed in such away that only a portion of the alloy melts when an appropriate energy level is applied. This type of LPS of metal alloys was the method used in the early EOS M250 direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) machines. Subsequent mLS5.3 Powder Fusion Mechanisms 119commercialized processes are all designed to fully melt the metal alloys they process. 5.3.4 Full Melting Full melting is the mechanism most commonly associated with PBF processing ofengineering metal alloys and semi-crystalline polymers. In these materials, theentire region of material subjected to impinging heat energy is melted to a depth exceeding the layer thickness. Thermal energy of subsequent scans of a laser or electron beam (next to or above the just-scanned area) is typically sufﬁcient tore-melt a portion of the previously solidiﬁed solid structure; and thus, this type offull melting is very effective at creating well-bonded, high-density structures fromengineering metals and polymers. The most common material used in PBF processing is nylon polyamide. As a semi-crystalline material, it has a distinct melting point. In order to produce partswith the highest possible strength, these materials should be fully melted during processing. However, elevated temperatures associated with full melting result in part growth and thus, for practical purposes, many accuracy versus strength opti-mization studies result in parameters which are at the threshold between fullmelting and LPS, as can be seen from Fig. 5.3. For metal PBF processes, the engineering alloys that are utilized in these machines (Ti, Stainless Steel, CoCr, etc.) are typically fully melted. The rapidmelting and solidiﬁcation of these metal alloys results in unique properties that aredistinct from, and can sometime be more desirable than, cast or wrought parts made from identical alloys. Figure 5.5summarizes the various binding mechanisms which are utilized in PBF processes. Regardless of whether a technology is known as “Selective LaserSintering,” “Selective Laser Melting,” “Direct Metal Laser Sintering,” “LaserCusing,” “Electron Beam Melting,” or some other name, it is possible for any of Primary Binding Mechanisms in Powder Bed Fusion Processes Solid State Sintering2.

In the full melting and LPS (with metal powders) approaches, a metalpart is typically usable in the state in which it comes out of the machine, after separation from a build plate. In indirect processing, a polymer coated metallic powder or a mixture of metallic and polymer powders are used for part construction. Figure 5.6shows the steps involved in indirect processing of metal powders. During indirect processing, thepolymer binder is melted and binds the particles together, and the metal powderremains solid. The metallic powder particles remain largely unaffected by the heatof the laser. The parts produced are generally porous (sometimes exceeding 50 vol.% porosity). The polymer-bound green parts are subsequently furnace processed. Furnace processing occurs in two stages: (1) debinding and (2) inﬁltration or consolidation. During debinding, the polymer binder is vaporized to remove itfrom the green part. Typically, the temperature is also raised to the extent that asmall degree of necking (sintering) occurs between the metal particles. Subse-quently, the remaining porosity is either ﬁlled by inﬁltration of a lower meltingpoint metal to produce a fully dense metallic part, or by further sintering anddensiﬁcation to reduce the part porosity. Inﬁltration is easier to control, dimension-ally, as the overall shrinkage is much less than during consolidation. However, inﬁltrated structures are always composite in nature whereas consolidated structures can be made up of a single material type.

For the previous three approaches, metal powder is utilized in the PBF process; but inthis ﬁnal approach, the part created in the PBF process is a pattern used to create the metal part. The two most common ways PBF-created parts are utilized as patterns for metal part creation are as investment casting patterns or as sand-casting molds.In the case of investment casting, polystyrene or wax-based powders are used in themachine, and subsequently invested in ceramic during post-processing, and meltedout during casting. In the case of sand-casting molds, mixtures of sand and athermosetting binder are directly processed in the machine to form a sand-castingcore, cavity or insert. These molds are then assembled and molten metal is cast intothe mold, creating a metal part. Both indirect and pattern-based processes are further discussed in Chap. 18. 5.3.5.2 Ceramic Parts Similar to metal parts, there are a number of ways that PBF processes are utilized to create ceramic parts. These include direct sintering, chemically induced sintering,indirect processing, and pattern methods. In direct sintering, a high-temperature ismaintained in the powder bed and a laser is utilized to accelerate sintering of the powder bed in the prescribed location of each layer. The resultant ceramic parts will be quite porous and thus are often post-processed in a furnace to achieve higherdensity. This high porosity is also seen in chemically induced sintering of ceramics,as described earlier. Indirect processing of ceramic powders is identical to indirect processing of metal powders (Fig. 5.6). After debinding, the ceramic brown part is consolidated to reduce porosity or is inﬁltrated. In the case of inﬁltration, when metal powders areused as the inﬁltrant then a ceramic/metal composite structure can be formed. In some cases, such as when creating SiC structures, a polymer binder can be selected, which leaves behind a signiﬁcant amount of carbon residue within the brown part.Inﬁltration with molten Si will result in a reaction between the molten Si and theremaining carbon to produce more SiC, thus increasing the overall SiC content andreducing the fraction of metal Si in the ﬁnal part. These and related approaches havebeen used to form interesting ceramic-matrix composites and ceramic-metalstructures for a number of different applications. 5.4 Process Parameters and Modeling Use of optimum process parameters is extremely important for producing satisfac-tory parts using PBF processes. In this section, we will discuss “laser” processingand parameters, but by analogy the parameters and models discussed below couldalso be applied to other thermal energy sources, such as electron beams or infraredheaters.122 5 Powder Bed Fusion Processes5.4.1 Process Parameters In PBF, process parameters can be lumped into four categories: (1) laser-related parameters (laser power, spot size, pulse duration, pulse frequency, etc.), (2) scan- related parameters (scan speed, scan spacing, and scan pattern), (3) powder-related parameters (particle shape, size, and distribution, powder bed density, layer thick-ness, material properties, etc.), and (4) temperature-related parameters (powder bedtemperature, powder feeder temperature, temperature uniformity, etc.). It should benoted that most of these parameters are strongly interdependent and are mutuallyinteracting. The required laser power, for instance, typically increases with meltingpoint of the material and lower powder bed temperature, and also varies dependingupon the absorptivity characteristics of the powder bed, which is inﬂuenced by material type and powder shape, size, and packing density. A typical PBF machine includes two galvanometers (one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis motion). Similar to stereolilthography, scanning often occurs in two modes, contour mode and ﬁll mode, as shown in Fig. 5.7. In contour mode, the outline of the part cross section for a particular layer is scanned. This is typicallydone for accuracy and surface ﬁnish reasons around the perimeter. The rest of thecross section is then scanned using a ﬁll pattern. A common ﬁll pattern is a rasteringtechnique whereby one axis is incrementally moved a laser scan width, and the other axis is continuously swept back and forth across the part being formed. In some cases the ﬁll section is subdivided into strips (where each strip is scannedsequentially and the strip angle is rotated every layer) or squares (with each squarebeing processed separately and randomly). Randomized scanning is sometimesutilized so that there is no preferential direction for residual stresses induced bythe scanning. The use of strips or a square-based strategy is primarily for metalparts, whereas a simple raster pattern for the entire part (without subdividing intostrips or squares) is typically used for polymers and other low-temperature processing. In addition to melt pool characteristics, scan pattern and scan strategy can have a profound impact on residual stress accumulation within a part. For instance, if a part Fig. 5.7 Scan strategies employed in PBF techniques5.4 Process Parameters and Modeling 123is moved from one location to another within a machine, the exact laser paths to build the part may change. These laser path changes may cause the part to distortmore in one location than another. Thus it is possible for a part to build successfully in one location but not in another location in the same machine due simply to how the scan strategy is applied in different locations. Powder shape, size, and distribution strongly inﬂuence laser absorption characteristics as well as powder bed density, powder bed thermal conductivity,and powder spreading. Finer particles provide greater surface area and absorb laserenergy more efﬁciently than coarser particles. Powder bed temperature, laserpower, scan speed, and scan spacing must be balanced to provide the best trade-off between melt pool size, dimensional accuracy, surface ﬁnish, build rate, and mechanical properties. The powder bed temperature should be kept uniform and constant to achieve repeatable results. Generally, high-laser-power/high-bed-tem-perature combinations produce dense parts, but can result in part growth, poorrecyclability, and difﬁculty cleaning parts. On the other hand, low-laser-power/low-bed-temperature combinations produce better dimensional accuracy, but result inlower density parts and a higher tendency for layer delamination. High-laser-powercombined with low-part-bed-temperatures result in an increased tendency fornonuniform shrinkage and the build-up of residual stresses, leading to curling of parts. Laser power, spot size and scan speed, and bed temperature together determine the energy input needed to fuse the powder into a useable part. The longer the laserdwells in a particular location, the deeper the fusion depth and the larger the meltpool diameter. Typical layer thicknesses range from 0.02 to 0.15 mm. Operating atlower laser powers requires the use of lower scan speeds in order to ensure properparticle fusion. Melt pool size is highly dependent upon settings of laser power,scan speed, spot size, and bed temperature. Scan spacing should be selected to ensure a sufﬁcient degree of melt pool overlap between adjacent lines of fused material to ensure robust mechanical properties. The powder bed density, as governed by powder shape, size, distribution, and spreading mechanism, can strongly inﬂuence the part quality. Powder bed densitiestypically range between 50 and 60 % for most commercially available powders, butmay be as low as 30 % for irregular ceramic powders. Generally the higher thepowder packing density, the higher the bed thermal conductivity and the better thepart mechanical properties. Most commercialized PBF processes use continuous-wave (CW) lasers. Laser- processing research with pulsed lasers, however, has demonstrated a number ofpotential beneﬁts over CW lasers. In particular, the tendency of molten metal toform disconnected balls of molten metal, rather than a ﬂat molten region on apowder bed surface, can be partially overcome by pulsed energy. Thus, it is likelythat future PBF machines will be commercialized with both CW and pulsed lasers.124 5 Powder Bed Fusion Processes5.4.2 Applied Energy Correlations and Scan Patterns Many common physics, thermodynamics, and heat transfer models are relevant to PBF techniques. In particular, solutions for stationary and moving point-heat- sources in an inﬁnite media and homogenization equations (to estimate, for instance, powder bed thermo-physical properties based upon powder morphology,packing density, etc.) are commonly utilized. The solidiﬁcation modeling discussedin the directed energy deposition (DED) chapter (Chap. 10) can also be applied to PBF processes. For the purposes of this chapter, a highly simpliﬁed model whichestimates the energy-input characteristics of PBF processes is introduced anddiscussed with respect to process optimization for PBF processes. Melt pool formation and characteristics are fundamentally determined by the total amount of applied energy which is absorbed by the powder bed as the laser beam passes. Both the melt pool size and melt pool depth are a function of absorbedenergy density. A simpliﬁed energy density equation has been used by numerousinvestigators as a simple method for correlating input process parameters to thedensity and strength of produced parts [ 2]. In their simpliﬁed model, applied energy density E A(also known as the Andrews number) can be found using ( 5.1): EA¼P=U/C2SP ðÞ ð 5:1Þ where Pis laser power, Uis scan velocity, and SP is the scan spacing between parallel scan lines. In this simpliﬁed model, applied energy increases with increas-ing laser power and decreases with increasing velocity and scan spacing. For pLS, typical scan spacing values are ~100 μm, whereas typical laser spot sizes are ~300 μm. Thus, typically every point is scanned by multiple passes of the laser beam. Although ( 5.1) does not include powder absorptivity, heat of fusion, laser spot size, bed temperature, or other important characteristics, it provides the simplestanalytical approach for optimizing machine performance for a material. For a givenmaterial, laser spot size and machine conﬁguration, a series of experiments can berun to determine the minimum applied energy necessary to achieve adequate material fusion for the desired material properties. Subsequently, build speed can be maximized by utilizing the fastest combination of laser power, scan rate, andscan spacing for a particular machine architecture based upon ( 5.1). Optimization of build speed using applied energy is reasonably effective for PBF of polymer materials. However, when a molten pool of metal is present on a powderbed, a phenomenon called balling often occurs. When surface tension forcesovercome a combination of dynamic ﬂuid, gravitational and adhesion forces, themolten metal will form a ball. The surface energy driving force for metal powders to limit their surface area to volume ratio (which is minimized as a sphere) is much greater than the driving force for polymers, and thus this phenomenon is unimpor-tant for polymers but critically important for metals. An example of ballingtendency at various power, P, and scan speed, U, combinations is shown in5.4 Process Parameters and Modeling 125Fig.5.8[3]. This ﬁgure illustrates ﬁve typical types of tracks which are formed at various process parameter combinations. A process map showing regions of power and scan speed combinations which result in each of these track types is shown in Fig. 5.9. As described by Childs et al. tracks of type A were continuous and ﬂat topped or slightly concave. Atslightly higher speeds, type B tracks became rounded and sank into the bed. As thespeed increased, type C tracks became occasionally broken, although not with theregularity of type D tracks at higher speeds, whose regularly and frequently brokentracks are perfect examples of the balling effect. At even higher speeds, fragiletracks were formed (type E) where the maximum temperatures exceed the solidustemperature but do not reach the liquidus temperature (i.e., partially melted or ab cde P(W) U(mm/s)110 0.5Track typeDirection of scan 110 2110 15110 2577 40Fig. 5.8 Five examples of test tracks made in /C0150/ +75μm M2 steel powder in an argon atmosphere with aCO 2laser beam of 1.1 mm spot size, at similar magniﬁcations ( # Professional Engineering Publishing, reproduced from T H C Childs, C Hauser, andM Badrossamay, Proceedingsof the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of EngineeringManufacture 219 (4), 2005) Fig. 5.9 Process map for track types shown in Fig. 5.8 (#Professional Engineering Publishing, reproduced from T H C Childs, C Hauser, andM Badrossamay, Proceedingsof the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of EngineeringManufacture 219 (4), 2005)126 5 Powder Bed Fusion Processesliquid phase sintered tracks). In region F, at the highest speed, lowest power combinations, no melting occurred. When considering these results, it is clear that build speed optimization for metals is complex, as a simple maximization of scan speed for a particular power and scan spacing based on ( 5.1) is not possible. However, within process map regions A and B, ( 5.1) could still be used as a guide for process optimization. Numerous researchers have investigated residual stresses and distortion in laser PBF processes using analytical and ﬁnite element methods. These studies haveshown that residual stresses and subsequent part deﬂection increase with increase intrack length. Based on these observations, dividing the scan area into small squaresor strips and then scanning each segment with short tracks is highly beneﬁcial. Thus, there are multiple reasons for subdividing the layer cross section into small regions for metals. Randomization of square scanning (rather than scanning contiguous squares one after the other) and changing the primary scan direction between squares helpsalleviate preferential build-up of residual stresses, as shown in Fig. 5.7. In addition, scanning of strips whereby the angle of the strip changes each layer has a positiveeffect on the build-up of residual stress. As a result, strips and square scan patternsare extensively utilized in PBF processes for metals. 5.5 Powder Handling 5.5.1 Powder Handling Challenges Several different systems for powder delivery in PBF processes have been devel-oped. The lack of a single solution for powder delivery goes beyond simply avoiding patented embodiments of the counter-rotating roller. The development of other approaches has resulted in a broader range of powder types andmorphologies which can be delivered. Any powder delivery system for PBF must meet at least four characteristics. It must have a powder reservoir of sufﬁcient volume to enable the process to build to the maximum build height without a need to pause the machine to reﬁllthe powder reservoir. The correct volume of powder must be transported from the powder reservoir to the build platform that is sufﬁcient to cover the previous layer but withoutwasteful excess material. The powder must be spread to form a smooth, thin, repeatable layer of powder.4. The powder spreading must not create excessive shear forces that disturb the previously processed layers. In addition, any powder delivery system must be able to deal with these universal characteristics of powder feeding.5.5 Powder Handling 1271. As particle size decreases, interparticle friction and electrostatic forces increase. These result in a situation where powder can lose its ﬂowability. (To illustratethis loss of ﬂowability, compare the ﬂow characteristics of a spoon full of granulated sugar to a spoon full of ﬁne ﬂour. The larger particle size sugar will ﬂow out of the spoon at a relatively shallow angle, whereas the ﬂour will stay inthe spoon until the spoon is tipped at a large angle, at which point the ﬂour willfall out as a large clump unless some perturbation (vibration, tapping, etc.)causes it to come out a small amount at a time. Thus, any effective powderdelivery system must make the powder ﬂowable for effective delivery to occur. When the surface area to volume ratio of a particle increases, its surface energy increases and becomes more reactive. For certain materials, this means that the powder becomes explosive in the presence of oxygen; or it will burn if there is a spark. As a result, certain powders must be kept in an inert atmosphere whilebeing processed, and powder handling should not result in the generation ofsparks. When handled, small particles have a tendency to become airborne and ﬂoat as a cloud of particles. In PBF machines, airborne particles will settle on surroundingsurfaces, which may cloud optics, reduce the sensitivity of sensors, deﬂect laserbeams, and damage moving parts. In addition, airborne particles have an effec- tive surface area greater than packed powders, increasing their tendency to explode or burn. As a result, the powder delivery system should be designed insuch a way that it minimizes the creation of airborne particles. Smaller powder particle sizes enable better surface ﬁnish, higher accuracy, and thinner layers. However, smaller powder particle sizes exacerbate all theproblems just mentioned. As a result, each design for a powder delivery systemis inherently a different approach to effectively feed the smallest possiblepowder particle sizes while minimizing the negative effects of these small powder particles. 5.5.2 Powder Handling Systems The earliest commercialized LS powder delivery system, illustrated in Fig. 5.1,i s one approach to optimizing these powder handling issues. The two feed cartridges represent the powder reservoir with sufﬁcient material to completely ﬁll the build platform to its greatest build height. The correct amount of powder for each layer isprovided by accurately incrementing the feed cartridge up a prescribed amount andthe build platform down by the layer thickness. The raised powder is then pushed bythe counter-rotating roller over the build platform, depositing the powder. As longas the height of the roller remains constant, layers will be created at the thicknesswith which the build platform moves. The counter-rotating action of the rollercreates a “wave” of powder ﬂowing in front of the cylinder. The counter-rotation pushes the powder up, ﬂuidizing the powder being pushed, making it more ﬂowable for a particular particle size and shape. The shear forces on the previously processed128 5 Powder Bed Fusion Processeslayers created by this counter-rotating roller are small, and thus the previously processed layers are relatively undisturbed. Another commonly utilized solution for powder spreading is a doctor blade. A doctor blade is simply a thin piece of metal that is used to scrape material across the surface of a powder bed. When a doctor blade is used, the powder is not ﬂuidized. Thus, the shear forces applied to the previously deposited layer are greater than fora counter-rotating roller. This increased shear can be reduced if the doctor blade isultrasonically vibrated, thus partly ﬂuidizing the powder being pushed. An alternative approach to using a feed cartridge as a powder reservoir is to use a hopper feeding system. A hopper system delivers powder to the powder bed fromabove rather than beneath. The powder reservoir is typically separate from the buildarea, and a feeding system is used to ﬁll the hopper. The hopper is then used to deposit powder in front of a roller or doctor blade, or a doctor blade or roller can be integrated with a hopper system for combined feeding and spreading. For bothfeeding and spreading, ultrasonic vibration can be utilized with any of theseapproaches to help ﬂuidize the powders. Various types of powder feeding systemsare illustrated in Fig. 5.10. In the case of multimaterial powder bed processing, the only effective method is to use multiple hoppers with separate materials. In a multi-hopper system, thematerial type can be changed layer-by-layer. Although this has been demonstrated in a research environment, and by some companies for very small parts; to date, all PBF technologies offered for sale commercially utilize a single-material powderfeeding system. 5.5.3 Powder Recycling As mentioned in Sect. 5.3.1 , elevated temperature sintering of the powder surrounding a part being built can cause the powder bed to fuse. In addition,elevated temperatures, particularly in the presence of reacting atmospheric gases,will also change the chemical nature of the powder particles. Similarly, holding Hopper Feed DirectionDoctor blade Newly depositedlayerFeed DirectionHopper PowderRoller Newly depositedlayerPlatform Platformab Fig. 5.10 Examples of hopper-based powder delivery systems [ 6]5.5 Powder Handling 129polymer materials at elevated temperatures can change the molecular weight of the polymer. These combined effects mean that the properties of many different typesof powders (particularly polymers) used in PBF processes change their properties when they are recycled and reused. For some materials these changes are small, and thus are considered highly recyclable or inﬁnitely recyclable. In other materialsthese changes are dramatic, and thus a highly controlled recycling methodologymust be used to maintain consistent part properties between builds. For the most popular PBF polymer material, nylon polyamide, both the effective particle size and molecular weight change during processing. As a result, a numberof recycling methodologies have been developed to seek to maintain consistentbuild properties. The simplest approach to this recycling problem is to mix a speciﬁc ratio of unused powder with used powders. An example of a fraction- based mixture might be 1/3 unused powder, 1/3 overﬂow/feed powder, and 1/3build platform powder. Overﬂow/feed and loose part-bed powder are handledseparately, as they experience different temperature proﬁles during the build. Therecaptured overﬂow/feed materials are only slightly modiﬁed from the originalmaterial as they have been subjected to lower temperatures only in the feed andoverﬂow cartridges; whereas, loose part-bed powder from the build platform hasbeen maintained at an elevated temperature, sometimes for many hours. Part-bed powder is typically processed using a particle sorting method, most commonly either a vibratory screen-based sifting device or an air classiﬁer, beforemixing with other powders. Air classiﬁers can be better than simple sifting, as theymix the powders together more effectively and help break up agglomerates, thusenabling a larger fraction of material to be recycled. However, air classiﬁers aremore complex and expensive than sifting systems. Regardless of the particle sortingmethod used, it is critical that the material be well-mixed during recycling; other-wise, parts built from recycled powder will have different properties in different locations. Although easy to implement, a simple fraction-based recycling approach will always result in some amount of mixing inconsistencies. This is due to the fact thatdifferent builds have different part layout characteristics and thus the loose part-bedpowder being recycled from one build has a different thermal history than loosepart-bed powder being recycled from a different build. In order to overcome some of the build-to-build inconsistencies inherent in fraction-based mixing, a recycling methodology based upon a powder’s melt ﬂow index (MFI) has been developed [ 4]. MFI is a measure of molten thermoplastic material ﬂow through an extrusion apparatus under prescribed conditions. ASTMand ISO standards, for instance, can be followed to ensure repeatability. Whenusing an MFI-based recycling methodology, a user determines a target MFI, basedupon their experience. Used powders (part-bed and overﬂow/feed materials) aremixed and tested. Unused powder is also tested. The MFI for both is determined,and a well-blended mixture of unused and used powder is created and subsequentlytested to achieve the target MFI. This may have to be done iteratively if the target MFI is not reached by the ﬁrst mixture of unused to used powder. Using this methodology, the closer the target MFI is to the new powder MFI, the higher the130 5 Powder Bed Fusion Processesnew powder fraction, and thus the more expensive the part. The MFI method is generally considered more effective for ensuring consistent build-to-buildproperties than fractional mixing. Typically, most users ﬁnd that they need less of the used build platform powder in their mixture than is produced. Thus, this excess build material becomes scrap. Inaddition, repeated recycling over a long period of time may result in some powderbecoming unusable. As a result, the recyclability of a powder and the target MFI orfractional mixing selected by a user can have a signiﬁcant effect on part propertiesand cost. 5.6 PBF Process Variants and Commercial Machines A large variety of PBF processes has been developed. To understand the practicaldifferences between these processes, it is important to know how the powderdelivery method, heating process, energy input type, atmospheric conditions,optics, and other features vary with respect to one another. An overview ofcommercial processes and a few notable systems under development are discussedin the following section. 5.6.1 Polymer Laser Sintering Prior to 2014 there were only two major producers of pLS machines, EOS and 3DSystems. The expiration of key patents in 2014 opened the door for many newcompanies to enter the marketplace. pLS machines are designed for directlyprocessing polymers and for indirect processing of metals and ceramics. Most commercial polymers were developed for processing via injection mold- ing. The thermal and stress conditions for a material processed via pLS, however,are much different than the thermal and stress conditions for a material processedvia injection molding. In injection molding the material is slowly heated under pressure, ﬂows under high shear forces into a mold, and is cooled quickly. In pLS the material is heated very quickly as a laser beam passes, it ﬂows via surfacetension under gravitational forces, and it cools slowly over a period of hours todays. Since polymer microstructural features depend upon the time the material isheld at elevated temperatures, polymer parts made using LS can have very differentproperties than polymer parts made using injection molding. Many polymers which are easy to process using injection molding may not be processable using pLS. Figure 5.11 illustrates a schematic of a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curve for the types of melting characteristics which are desirable in a polymer for LS. In order to reduce residual stress induced curling, pLSmachines hold the powder bed temperature ( T bed) just below the temperature where melting begins ( TMelt Onset ). When the laser melts a region of the powder bed, it should raise the temperature of the material above the melting temperature,but below the temperature at which the material begins to deteriorate. If there is a5.6 PBF Process Variants and Commercial Machines 131small difference between the melting and deterioration temperatures, then the material will be difﬁcult to successfully process in pLS. After scanning, the molten cross section will return over a relatively short period of time to the bed temperature ( TBed). If the bed temperature is above the crystalli- zation temperature of the material, then it will remain in a partially molten state for a very long time. This is advantageous for two reasons. First, by keeping the material partially molten, the part will not experience layer-by-layer accumulation of residual stresses and thus will be more accurate. Secondly, by holding the material in a semi-molten state for a long period of time, the part will achieve higher overall density. As a result, parts at the bottom of a build platform (which were built ﬁrst and experience a longer time at elevated temperature) are denser than the last parts to be built. Thus, a key characteristic of a good polymer for pLS is that it has a broad “Super-Cooling Window” as illustrated in Fig. 5.11. For most commercially available polymers, the melting curve overlaps the crystallization curve and there is no super-cooling window. In addition, for amorphous polymers, there is no sharp onset of melting or crystallization. Thus pLS works best for polymers that are crystalline with a large super-cooling window and a high deterio- ration temperature. The SLS Sinterstation 2000 machine was the ﬁrst commercial PBF system, introduced by the DTM Corporation, USA, in 1992. Subsequently, other variants were commercialized, and these systems are still manufactured and supplied by 3D Systems, USA, which purchased DTM in 2001. Newer machines offer several improvements over previous systems in terms of part accuracy, temperature Fig. 5.11 Melting and solidiﬁcation characteristics for an idealized polymer DSC curve for polymer laser sintering (courtesy: Neil Hopkinson, Shefﬁeld University)132 5 Powder Bed Fusion Processesuniformity, build speed, process repeatability, feature deﬁnition, and surface ﬁnish, but the basic processing features and system conﬁguration remain unchanged fromthe description in Sect. 5.1. A typical pLS machine is limited to polymers with a melting temperature below 200 /C14C, whereas “high-temperature” pLS machines can process polymers with much higher melting temperature. Due to the use of CO 2 lasers and a nitrogen atmosphere with approximately 0.1–3.0 % oxygen, pLSmachines are incapable of directly processing pure metals or ceramics. Nylonpolyamide materials are the most popular pLS materials, but these processes canalso be used for many other types of polymer materials as well as indirectprocessing of metal and ceramic powders with polymer binders. EOS GmbH, Germany, introduced its ﬁrst EOSINT P machine in 1994 for producing plastic prototypes. In 1995, the company introduced its EOSINT M 250 machine for direct manufacture of metal casting molds from foundry sand. In1998, the EOSINT M 250 Xtended machine was launched for DMLS, which was aLPS approach to processing metallic powders. These early metal machines used aspecial alloy mixture comprised of bronze and nickel powders developed byElectrolux Rapid Prototyping, and licensed exclusively to EOS. The powdercould be processed at low temperatures, required no preheating and exhibitednegligible shrinkage during processing; however, the end-product was porous and was not representative of any common engineering metal alloys. Subsequently, EOS introduced many other materials and models, including platforms for foundrysand and full melting of metal powders (which will be discussed in the followingsection). One unique feature of EOS’s large-platform systems for polymers andfoundry sand is the use of two laser beams for faster part construction (as illustratedin the 2 /C21D channels example in Fig. 2.6). This multi-machine approach to PBF has made EOS the market leader in this technology segment. A schematic of anEOS machine illustrating their approach to laser sintering powder delivery and processing for foundry sand is shown in Fig. 5.12. More recent, large-platform pLS systems commonly use a modular design. This modularity can include: removable build platforms so that part cool-down andwarm-up can occur outside of the chamber, enabling a fresh build platform to beinserted and used with minimal laser down-time; multiple build platform sizes;automated recycling and feeding of powder using a connected powder handlingsystem; and better thermal control options. In addition to commercial PBF machines, open-source polymer PBF machines are being developed to mimic the success of the RepRap effort for material extrusion machines. In addition, inventors have applied PBF techniques to nonen-gineering applications via the CandyFab machine. Sugar is used as the powderedmaterial, and a hot air nozzle is used as the energy source. By scanning the nozzleacross the bed in a layer-by-layer fashion, sugar structures are made.5.6 PBF Process Variants and Commercial Machines 1335.6.2 Laser-Based Systems for Metals and Ceramics There are many companies which make commercially available laser-based systems for direct melting and sintering of metal powders: EOS (Germany), Renishaw (UK), Concept Laser (Germany), Selective Laser Melting (SLM)Solutions (Germany), Realizer (Germany), and 3D Systems (France/USA). Thereare competing terminologies for these technologies. The term selective laser melt-ing (SLM) is used by numerous companies; however the terms Laser Cusing andDMLS are also used by certain manufacturers. For this discussion, we will use mLSto refer to the technologies in general and not to any particular variant. mLS research in the late 1980s and early 1990s by various research groups was mostly unsuccessful. Compared to polymers, the high thermal conductivity, pro- pensity to oxidize, high surface tension, and high laser reﬂectivity of metal powdersmake them signiﬁcantly more difﬁcult to process than polymers. Most commer-cially available mLS systems today are variants of the selective laser powderre-melting (SLPR) approach developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Tech-nology, Germany. Their research developed the basic processing techniques neces-sary for successful laser-based, point-wise melting of metals. The use of lasers withwavelengths better tuned to the absorptivity of metal powders was one key for enabling mLS. Fraunhofer used an Nd-YAG laser instead of the CO 2laser used in pLS, which resulted in a much better absorptivity for metal powders (see Fig. 5.13). Subsequently, almost all mLS machines use ﬁber lasers, which in general are Laserpowder / sand hopper recoater part container1. Exposure Recoating 3. Dispensing2.

The other key enablers for mLS, compared topLS, are different laser scan patterns (discussed in the following section), the use off-theta lenses to minimize beam distortion during scanning, and low oxygen, inertatmosphere control. One common practice among mLS manufacturers is the rigid attachment of their parts to a base plate at the bottom of the build platform. This is done to keep the metal part being built from distorting due to residual stresses. This means that thedesign ﬂexibility for parts made from mLS is not quite as broad as the designﬂexibility for parts made using laser sintering of polymers, due to the need toremove these rigid supports using a machining or cutting operation. Over the years, various mLS machine manufacturers have sought to differentiate themselves from others by the features they offer. This differentiation includes laserpower, number of lasers offered, powder handling systems, scanning strategies offered, maximum build volume, and more. Some machine manufacturers give users more control over the process parameters than other manufacturers, enablingmore experimentation by the user, whereas other manufacturers only provide“proven” materials and process parameters. For instance, Renishaw machineshave safety features to help minimize the risk of powder ﬁres. EOS, as the world’smost successful metal PBF provider, has spent considerable time tuning theirmachine process parameters and scanning strategies for speciﬁc materials whichthey sell to their customers. Concept Laser has focused on the development of stainless and hot-work steel alloys suitable for injection mold and die cast tooling. 3D Systems (after their acquisition of Phenix Systems) has developed machineswhich can be held at an elevated temperature, thus enabling efﬁcient sintering of 0Fiber lasers 010203040I 5060 24Nd: YAG Laser Wavelength Aluminum Copper Iron Molybdenum Nickel Platnum TungstenChromiumCO2 Laser Wavelength 68 1 0Optical Absorption %Optical Absorption vs Wavelength 12 14 Fig. 5.13 Optical absorption % (absorptivity) of selected metals versus wavelength (units are micrometers) (courtesy: Optomec)5.6 PBF Process Variants and Commercial Machines 135ceramic powders, in addition to melting of metal powders. Another unique charac- teristic of the 3D Systems machine is its use of a roller to spread and then compact powder, making it the only manufacturer which can directly change the powder bedpacking density on-the-ﬂy. 3D-Micromac, Germany, a partner of EOS, produces the only multimaterial, small-scale mLS machine. It has developed small-scale mLS processes with smallbuild cylinders 25 or 50 mm in diameter and 40 mm in height. Their ﬁber laser isfocused to a particularly small spot size, for small feature deﬁnition. In order to usethe ﬁne powder particle sizes necessary for ﬁne feature reproduction, they have developed a unique two-material powder feeding mechanism, shown in Fig. 5.14. The build platform is located between two powder feed cylinders. When therotating rocker arm is above a powder feed cylinder, the powder is pushed upinto the feeder, thus charging the hopper. When the rocker arm is moved over top ofthe build platform, it deposits and smoothens the powder, moving away from thebuild cylinder prior to laser processing. By alternating between feed cylinders, thematerial being processed can be changed in a layer-by-layer fashion, thus formingmultimaterial structures. An example of a small impeller made using aluminum oxide powders is shown in Fig. 5.15. 5.6.3 Electron Beam Melting Electron beam melting (EBM) has become a successful approach to PBF. In contrast to laser-based systems, EBM uses a high-energy electron beam to induce fusion between metal powder particles. This process was developed at ChalmersUniversity of Technology, Sweden, and was commercialized by Arcam AB,Sweden, in 2001. Similarly to mLS, in the EBM process, a focused electron beam scans across a thin layer of pre-laid powder, causing localized melting and resolidiﬁcation per the Fig. 5.14 3D Micromac Powder Feed System. In this picture, only one of the powder feeders (located overthe build cylinder) is ﬁlledwith powder (courtesy: Laserinstitut Mittelsachsen e.V.)136 5 Powder Bed Fusion Processesslice cross section. There are a number of differences between how mLS and EBM are typically practiced, which are summarized in Table 5.1. Many of these differences are due to EBM having an energy source of electrons, but other differences are due to engineering trade-offs as practiced in EBM and mLS and are not necessarily inherent to the processing. A schematic illustration of an EBM apparatus is shown in Fig. 5.16. Laser beams heat the powder when photons are absorbed by powder particles. Electron beams, however, heat powder by transfer of kinetic energy from incoming electrons into powder particles. As powder particles absorb electrons they gain an increasingly negative charge. This has two potentially detrimental effects: (1) if the repulsive force of neighboring negatively charged particles overcomes the gravita- tional and frictional forces holding them in place, there will be a rapid expulsion of powder particles from the powder bed, creating a powder cloud (which is worse for Fig. 5.15 Example 3D Micromac part made from aluminum oxide powders (courtesy: Laserinstitut Mittelsachsen e.V.)

There are no such complimentary phenomena with photons. As a result, the conductivity of the powder bed in EBM must be high enough that powder particles do not become highly negatively charged, and scanstrategies must be used to avoid build-up of regions of negatively charged particles.In practice, electron beam energy is more diffuse, in part, so as not to build up toogreat a negative charge in any one location. As a result, the effective melt pool sizeincreases, creating a larger heat-affected zone. Consequently, the minimum featuresize, median powder particle size, layer thickness, resolution, and surface ﬁnish ofan EBM process are typically larger than for an mLS process. As mentioned above, in EBM the powder bed must be conductive. Thus, EBM can only be used to process conductive materials (e.g., metals) whereas, lasers canbe used with any material that absorbs energy at the laser wavelength (e.g., metals,polymers, and ceramics). Electron beam generation is typically a much more efﬁcient process than laser beam generation. When a voltage difference is applied to the heated ﬁlament in anelectron beam system, most of the electrical energy is converted into the electronbeam; and higher beam energies (above 1 kW) are available at a moderate cost. In contrast, it is common for only 10–20 % of the total electrical energy input for laser systems to be converted into beam energy, with the remaining energy lost in theform of heat. In addition, lasers with beam energies above 1 kW are typically much Filament Grid Cup Anode Focus coiling (controls spot size) Deflection coil (controls x-y motion) Electron Beam Powder Hopper Vacuum Chamber Build PlatformFig. 5.16 Schematic of an EBM apparatus (courtesy: Arcam)138 5 Powder Bed Fusion Processesmore expensive than comparable electron beams with similar energies. Thus, electron beams are a less costly high energy source than laser beams. Newer ﬁber lasers, however, are more simple in their design, more reliable to maintain, and more efﬁcient to use (with conversion efﬁciencies reported of 70–80 % for some ﬁber lasers). Thus, this energy advantage for electron beams may not be a major advantage in the future. EBM powder beds are maintained at a higher temperature than mLS powder beds. There are several reasons for this. First, the higher energy input of the beam used in the EBM system naturally heats the surrounding loose powder to a higher temperature than the lower energy laser beams. In order to maintain a steady-state uniform temperature throughout the build (rather than having the build become hotter as the build height increases) the EBM process uses the electron beam to heat the metal substrate at the bottom of the build platform before laying a powder bed. By defocusing the electron beam and scanning it very rapidly over the entire surface of the substrate (or the powder bed for subsequently layers) the bed can be preheated rapidly and uniformly to any preset temperature. As a result, the radiative and resistive heaters present in some mLS systems for substrate and powder bed heating are not used in EBM. By maintaining the powder bed at an elevated temperature, however, the resulting microstructure of a typical EBM part is signiﬁ- cantly different from a typical mLS part (see Fig. 5.17). In particular, in mLS the individual laser scan lines are typically easily distinguishable, whereas individual scan lines are often indistinguishable in EBM microstructures. Rapid cooling in mLS creates smaller grain sizes and subsequent layer scans only partially re-melt the previously deposited layer. The powder bed is held at a low enough temperature that elevated temperature grain growth does not erase the layering effects. In EBM, the higher temperature of the powder bed, and the larger and more diffuse heat input result in a contiguous grain pattern that is more representative of a cast microstruc- ture, with less porosity than an mLS microstructure. Although the microstructures presented in Fig. 5.17 are representative of mLS and EBM, it should be noted that the presence of beam traces in the ﬁnal Fig. 5.17 Representative CoCrMo mLS microstructure ( left, courtesy: EOS), and Ti6Al4V EBM microstructure ( right, courtesy: Arcam)5.6 PBF Process Variants and Commercial Machines 139microstructure (as seen in the left image of Fig. 5.17) is process parameter and material dependent. For certain alloys, such as titanium, it is not uncommon forcontiguous grain growth across layers even for mLS. For other materials, such as those that have a higher melting point, the layering may be more prevalent. In addition, layering is more prevalent for process parameter combinations of lowerbed temperature, lower beam energy, faster scan rate, thicker layers, and/or largerscan spacing for both mLS and EBM. The reader is also referred to the presentationof material microstructures and process parameter effects of the DED processes inSects. 10.6 and10.7, since the phenomena seen mLS and EBM are similar to those observed in DED processes. One of the most promising aspects of EBM is the ability to move the beam nearly instantaneously. The current control system for EBM machines makes use of this capability to keep multiple melt pools moving simultaneously for part contourscanning. Future improvements to scanning strategies may dramatically increasethe build speed of EBM over mLS, helping to distinguish it even more for certainapplications. For instance, when nonsolid cross sections are created, in particularwhen scanning truss-like structures (with designed internal porosity), nearly instan-taneous beam motion from one scan location to another can dramatically speed upthe production of the overall product. In EBM, residual stresses are much lower than for mLS due to the elevated bed temperature. Supports are needed to provide electrical conduction through thepowder bed to the base plate, to eliminate electron charging, but the mass ofthese supports is an order of magnitude less than what is needed for mLS of asimilar geometry. Future scan strategies for mLS may help reduce the need forsupports to a degree where they can be removed easily, but at present EBM has aclear advantage when it comes to minimizing residual stress and supports. 5.6.4 Line-Wise and Layer-Wise PBF Processes for Polymers PBF processes have proven to be the most ﬂexible general approach to AM. For production of end-use components, PBF processes surpass the applicability of any other approach. However, the use of expensive lasers in most processes, the factthat these lasers can only process one “point” of material at any instant in time, andthe overall cost of the systems means that there is considerable room for improve-ment. As a result, several organizations are developing ways to fuse lines or layersof polymer material at a time. The potential for polymer processing in a line-wise orlayer-wise manner could dramatically increase the build-rate of PBF processes, thusmaking them more cost-competitive. Three of these processes will be discussed below. All three utilize infrared energy to induce fusion in powder beds; the key differences lay in their approach to controlling which portions of the powder bedfuse and which remain unfused, as illustrated in Fig. 5.18. Sintermask GmbH, Germany, founded in 2009, sold several selective mask sintering (SMS) machines, based upon technology developed at SpeedpartAB. The key characteristics of their technology are exposure of an entire layer at a140 5 Powder Bed Fusion Processestime to infrared thermal energy through a mask, and rapid layering of powdered material. Their powder delivery system can deposit a new layer of powder in 3 s.Heat energy is provided by an infrared heater. A dynamic mask system, similar tothose used in a photocopier to transfer ink to paper, is used between the heater andthe powder bed. This is a re-birth of an idea conceived by Cubital for layer-wisephotopolymerization in the early days of AM, as mentioned in Chap. 2. The SMS mask allows infrared energy to impinge on the powder bed only in the region prescribed by the layer cross section, fusing powder in approximately 1 s. From amaterials standpoint, the use of an infrared energy source means that the powdermust readily absorb and quickly sinter or melt in the presence of infrared energy.Most materials with this characteristic are dark colored (e.g., gray or black) and thuscolor-choice limitations may be a factor for some adopters of the technology. Itappears that development of this technology is on hold, as of the writing of this book. High-speed sintering (HSS) is a process developed at Loughborough University and Shefﬁeld University and being commercialized by FACTUM. In HSS, an ink-jet printer is used to deposit ink onto the powder bed, representing a part’scross section for that layer. Inks are specially formulated to signiﬁcantly enhance IR heater IR heaterMaskInkjet printing of absorptivity-enhancingagent Feed CartridgesFeed Cartridges Feed CartridgesBuild Platform Build PlatformBuild Platform Inkjet printing of sintering inhibitor IR heatera b c Fig. 5.18 Three different approaches to line- and layer-wise powder bed fusion processing ( a) mask-based sintering, ( b) printing of an absorptivity-enhancing agent in the part region, and ( c) printing of a sintering inhibitor outside the part region5.6 PBF Process Variants and Commercial Machines 141infrared absorption compared with the surrounding powder bed. An infrared heater is used to scan the entire powder bed quickly, following ink-jetting. Thus, thisprocess is an example of line-wise processing. The difference between the absorp- tivity of the unprinted areas compared to the printed areas means that the unprinted areas do not absorb enough energy to sinter, whereas the powder in the printed areassinters and/or melts. As the distinguishing factor between the fused and unfusedregion is the enhanced absorption of energy where printing occurs, the inks aretypically gray or black and thus affect the color of the ﬁnal part. A third approach to rapid PBF is the selective inhibition sintering (SIS) process, developed at the University of Southern California. In contrast to HSS, a sinteringinhibitor is printed in regions where fusion is not desired, followed by exposure to infrared radiation. In this case, the inhibitor interferes with diffusion and surface properties to inhibit sintering. In addition, researchers have also utilized movableplates to mask portions of the powder bed where no sintering is desired, in order tominimize the amount of inhibitor required. One beneﬁt of SIS over the previous twoare that it does not involve adding an infrared absorption agent into the part itself,and thus the untreated powder becomes the material in the part. However, theunused powder in the powder bed is not easily recyclable, as it has been“contaminated” with inhibitor, and thus, there is signiﬁcant unrecyclable material created. Two additional variations of ink-jet printing combined with PBF methodology are also practiced in SIS and by fcubic AB. In SIS, if no sintering is performedduring the build (i.e., inhibitor is printed but no thermal infrared energy is scanned)the entire part bed can be moved into an oven where the powder is sintered toachieve fusion within the part, but not in areas where inhibitor has been printed. fcubic AB, Sweden, uses ink-jet printing plus sintering in a furnace to compete with traditional powder metallurgy for stainless steel components. A sintering aid is printed in the regions representing the part cross section, so that this region will fuse more rapidly in a furnace. A sintering aid is an element or alloy which increases therate at which solid-state sintering occurs between particles by changing surfacecharacteristics and/or by reacting with the particles. Thus, sintering in the part willoccur at lower temperatures and times than for the surrounding powder that has notreceived a sintering aid. Both SIS and fcubic are similar to the binder jetting processes described in Chap. 8(such as practiced by ExOne and Voxeljet) where a binder joins powders in regions of the powder bed where the part is located followed by furnace processing. There is, however, one key aspect of SIS and the fcubic processing which isdifferent than these approaches. In the SIS and fcubic processes, the printedmaterial is a sintering aid or inhibitor rather than a binder, and the part remains embedded within the powder bed when sintering in the furnace. Using the ExOne process, for instance, the machine prints a binder to glue powder particles together;and the bound regions are removed from the powder bed as a green part before sintering in a furnace (much like the indirect metal processing discussed earlier). Common to all of the line-wise and layer-wise PBF processes is the need to differentiate between fusion in the part versus the remaining powder. Too low of142 5 Powder Bed Fusion Processestotal energy input will leave the part weak and only partially sintered. Too high of energy levels will result in part growth by sintering of excess surrounding powder tothe part and/or degradation of the surrounding powder to the point where it cannot be easily recycled. Most importantly, in all cases it is the difference between fusion induced in the part versus fusion induced in the surrounding powder bed that is thekey factor to control. 5.7 Process Benefits and Drawbacks Due to its nature, PBF can process a very wide variety of materials, in contrast tomany other AM processes. Although it is easier to control the processing of semi-crystalline polymers, the PBF processing of amorphous polymers has been success-ful. Many metals can be processed; as mentioned, if a metal can be welded, it is agood candidate for mLS. Some ceramic materials are commercially available, but quite a few others have been demonstrated in research. During part building, loose powder is a sufﬁcient support material for polymer PBF. This saves signiﬁcant time during part building and post-processing, andenables advanced geometries that are difﬁcult to post-process when supports arenecessary. As a result, internal cooling channels and other complex features thatwould be impossible to machine are possible in polymer PBF. Supports, however, are required for most metal PBF processes. The high residual stresses experienced when processing metals means that support structures are typically required to keep the part from excessive warping. This means that post- processing of metal parts after AM can be expensive and time consuming. Smallfeatures (including internal cooling channels) can usually be formed withoutsupports; but the part itself is usually constrained to a substrate at the bottom ofthe build platform to keep it from warping. As a result, the orientation of the partand the location of supports are key factors when setting up a build. Accuracy and surface ﬁnish of powder-based AM processes are typically infe- rior to liquid-based processes. However, accuracy and surface ﬁnish are strongly inﬂuenced by the operating conditions and the powder particle size. Finer particle sizes produce smoother, more accurate parts but are difﬁcult to spread and handle.Larger particle sizes facilitate easier powder processing and delivery, but hurtsurface ﬁnish, minimum feature size and minimum layer thickness. The buildmaterials used in these processes typically exhibit 3–4 % shrinkage, which canlead to part distortion. Materials with low thermal conductivity result in betteraccuracy as melt pool and solidiﬁcation are more controllable and part growth isminimized when heat conduction is minimized. With PBF processes, total part construction time can take longer than other additive manufacturing processes because of the preheat and cool-down cyclesinvolved. However, as is the case with several newer machine designs, removablebuild platforms enable preheat and cool-down to occur off-line, thus enabling muchgreater machine productivity. Additionally, the ability to nest polymer parts inthree-dimensions, as no support structures are needed, mean that many parts can be5.7 Process Benefits and Drawbacks 143produced in a single build, thus dramatically improving the productivity of these processes when compared with processes that require supports. 5.8 Conclusions PBF processes were one of the earliest AM processes, and continue to be one of themost popular. Polymer-based laser sintering is commonly used for prototyping andend-use applications in many industries, competing with injection molding andother polymer manufacturing processes. PBF processes are particularly competitivefor low-to-medium volume geometrically complex parts. Metal-based processes, including laser and electron beam, are one of the fastest growing areas of AM around the world. Metal PBF processes are becoming increasingly common for aerospace and biomedical applications, due to their inherent geometric complexity beneﬁts and their excellent material propertieswhen compared to traditional metal manufacturing techniques. As methods for moving from point-wise to line-wise to layer-wise PBF are improved and commercialized, build times and cost will decrease. This will makePBF processing even more competitive. The future for PBF remains bright; and it islikely that PBF processes will remain one of the most common types of AMtechnologies for the foreseeable future. 5.9 Exercises Find a reference which describes an application of the Arrhenius equation to solid state sintering.

Whilst there are other techniques for creating the extrusion, heat is normally used tomelt bulk material in a small, portable chamber. The material is pushed throughby a tractor-feed system, which creates the pressure to extrude. This chapterdeals with AM technologies that use extrusion to form parts. We will cover the basic theory and attempt to explain why it is a leading AM technology. 6.1 Introduction Material extrusion technologies can be visualized as similar to cake icing, in thatmaterial contained in a reservoir is forced out through a nozzle when pressure is applied. If the pressure remains constant, then the resulting extruded material(commonly referred to as “roads”) will ﬂow at a constant rate and will remain aconstant cross-sectional diameter. This diameter will remain constant if the travelof the nozzle across a depositing surface is also kept at a constant speed thatcorresponds to the ﬂow rate. The material that is being extruded must be in asemisolid state when it comes out of the nozzle. This material must fully solidifywhile remaining in that shape. Furthermore, the material must bond to material that has already been extruded so that a solid structure can result. Since material is extruded, the AM machine must be capable of scanning in a horizontal plane as well as starting and stopping the ﬂow of material whilescanning. Once a layer is completed, the machine must index upwards, or movethe part downwards, so that a further layer can be produced. There are two primary approaches when using an extrusion process. The most commonly used approach is to use temperature as a way of controlling the materialstate. Molten material is liqueﬁed inside a reservoir so that it can ﬂow out through the nozzle and bond with adjacent material before solidifying. This approach is similar to conventional polymer extrusion processes, except the extruder is #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_6147vertically mounted on a plotting system rather than remaining in a ﬁxed horizontal position. An alternative approach is to use a chemical change to cause solidiﬁcation. In such cases, a curing agent, residual solvent, reaction with air, or simply drying of a “wet” material permits bonding to occur. Parts may therefore cure or dry out tobecome fully stable. This approach is can be utilized with paste materials. Addi-tionally, it may be more applicable to biochemical applications where materialsmust have biocompatibility with living cells and so choice of material is veryrestricted. However, industrial applications may also exist, perhaps using reactioninjection molding-related processes rather than relying entirely on thermal effects. This chapter will start off by describing the basic principles of extrusion-based additive manufacturing. Following this will be a description of the most widely used extrusion-based technology, developed and commercialized by the Stratasyscompany. Bioplotting equipment for tissue engineering and scaffold applicationscommonly use extrusion technology and a discussion on how this differs from theStratasys approach will ensue. Finally, there have been a number of interestingresearch projects employing, adapting, and developing this technology, and thiswill be covered at the end of the chapter. 6.2 Basic Principles There are a number of key features that are common to any extrusion-based system: – Loading of material – Liquiﬁcation of the material– Application of pressure to move the material through the nozzle – Extrusion – Plotting according to a predeﬁned path and in a controlled manner– Bonding of the material to itself or secondary build materials to form a coherent solid structure – Inclusion of support structures to enable complex geometrical features These will be considered in separate sections to fully understand the intricacies of extrusion-based AM. A mathematical or physics-based understanding of extrusion processes can quickly become complex, since it can involve many nonlinear terms. The basicscience involves extrusion of highly viscous materials through a nozzle. It isreasonable to assume that the material ﬂows as a Newtonian ﬂuid in most cases[1]. Most of the discussion in these sections will assume the extrusion is of molten material and may therefore include temperature terms. For solidiﬁcation, thesetemperature terms are generally expressed relative to time; and so temperaturecould be replaced by other time-dependent factors to describe curing or drying processes.148 6 Extrusion-Based Systems6.2.1 Material Loading Since extrusion is used, there must be a chamber from which the material is extruded. This could be preloaded with material, but it would be more useful if there was a continuous supply of material into this chamber. If the material is in a liquid form, then the ideal approach is to pump this material. Most bulk material is,however, supplied as a solid and the most suitable methods of supply are in pellet orpowder form, or where the material is fed in as a continuous ﬁlament. The chamberitself is therefore the main location for the liquiﬁcation process. Pellets, granules, orpowders are fed through the chamber under gravity or with the aid of a screw orsimilar propelling process. Materials that are fed through the system under gravityrequire a plunger or compressed gas to force it through the narrow nozzle. Screw feeding not only pushes the material through to the base of the reservoir but can be sufﬁcient to generate the pressure needed to push it through the nozzle as well. Acontinuous ﬁlament can be pushed into the reservoir chamber, thus providing amechanism for generating an input pressure for the nozzle. 6.2.2 Liquification The extrusion method works on the principle that what is held in the chamber willbecome a liquid that can eventually be pushed through the die or nozzle. Asmentioned earlier, this material could be in the form of a solution that will quicklysolidify following the extrusion, but more likely this material will be liquid becauseof heat applied to the chamber. Such heat would normally be applied by heater coils wrapped around the chamber and ideally this heat should be applied to maintain a constant temperature in the melt (see Fig. 6.1). The larger the chamber, the more difﬁcult this can become for numerous reasons related to heat transfer, thermalcurrents within the melt, change in physical state of the molten material, location oftemperature sensors, etc. The material inside the chamber should be kept in a molten state but care should be taken to maintain it at as low a temperature as possible since some polymersdegrade quickly at higher temperatures and could also burn, leaving residue on the inside of the chamber that would be difﬁcult to remove and that would contaminate further melt. A higher temperature inside the chamber also requires additionalcooling following extrusion. 6.2.3 Extrusion The extrusion nozzle determines the shape and size of the extruded ﬁlament. Alarger nozzle diameter will enable material to ﬂow more rapidly but would result ina part with lower precision compared with the original CAD drawing. The diameterof the nozzle also determines the minimum feature size that can be created. Nofeature can be smaller than this diameter and in practice features should normally be6.2 Basic Principles 149large relative to the nozzle diameter to faithfully reproduce them with satisfactory strength. Extrusion-based processes are therefore more suitable for larger parts that have features and wall thicknesses that are at least twice the nominal diameter of theextrusion nozzle used. Material ﬂow through the nozzle is controlled by the pressure drop between the chamber and the surrounding atmosphere. However, the extrusion process used forAM may not be the same as conventional extrusion. For example, the pressuredeveloped to push the molten material through the nozzle is typically not generatedby a screw mechanism. However, to understand the process it may be useful to study a traditional screw-fed extrusion process as described, for example, by Stevens and Covas [ 2]. Mass ﬂow through a nozzle is related to pressure drop, nozzle geometry, and material viscosity. The viscosity is of course primarily afunction of temperature. Since no special dies or material mixing is required for thistype of application, it can be said to behave in a similar manner to a singleArchimedean screw extruder as shown in Fig. 6.2. Using simple screw geometry, molten material will gradually move along the screw channel towards the end of the screw where the nozzle is. The velocity Wof material ﬂow along the channel will be W¼πDNcosϕ ð6:1Þ where Dis the screw diameter, Nis the screw speed, and ϕis the screw angle. The velocity of the material Utowards the nozzle is therefore Fig. 6.1 Schematic of extrusion-based systems150 6 Extrusion-Based SystemsU¼πDNsinϕ ð6:2Þ For a constant helix angle, the volumetric ﬂow caused by the screw in the barrel, known as drag ﬂow QD, is proportional to the screw dimensions and speed QDαD2NH Since we are operating under drag ﬂow, the relative velocity of the molten material will be Wfor the material that is in contact with the screw, and 0 for the material in contact with the stationary walls of the barrel. We must therefore integrate over theheight of the screw. Generalizing the molten material traveling down this rectan-gular channel, the along-channel ﬂow Q Dthrough a channel of Bwidth and d y height can be expressed as QD¼ZH 0W 2Bdy ¼WBH 2ð6:3Þ where His the screw depth. W/2 is deﬁned as the mean down-channel velocity. Substituting for W(6.1) for the screw feed system gives QD¼π 2DNBH cosϕ We must now consider pressure ﬂow in the channel. Flow through a slit channel, width L, height H, and of inﬁnite length can be derived from the following fundamental equation for shear stress τ Fig. 6.2 A single Archimedian screw segment.

Since thepressure ﬂow rate is volume over time, factoring in Bas the screw pitch, or the breadth of the channel and Has the screw depth or the height of the channel: Q P¼BH3 12η:dP dzð6:8Þ The pressure calculation for a screw feed is similar to that of ﬂow down a rectangular slit or channel. In order for material to ﬂow down the screw, andtherefore material to extrude from the output nozzle, the pressure ﬂow Q Pmust exceed the drag ﬂow to give a total ﬂow QT¼QP/C0QD ¼BH3 12η:dP dz/C0WBH 2ð6:9Þ152 6 Extrusion-Based SystemsThis provides us with an expression that describes the ﬂow of material back up the rectangular channel as well as down the screw feed, therefore modeling the dragﬂow generated by the screw and the back ﬂow generated by the pressure differential of the chamber and the output nozzle. A similar pressure ﬂow expression can be formulated for a circular nozzle to model the extrusion process itself. It is assumedthat only melt ﬂow exists and that there is a stable and constant temperature withinthe melt chamber. Both of these are reasonable assumptions. If a pinch roller feed system is used like in Fig. 6.1, which is in fact the most common approach, one can consider the forces generated by the rollers as themechanism for generating the extrusion pressure. If the force generated by therollers exceeds the exit pressure then buckling will occur in the ﬁlament feedstock, assuming there is no slippage between the material and the rollers. An excellent model analysis of the pinch roller feed system can be found in Turner et al. [ 3]. This analysis indicates that the feed forces are related to elastic modulus and that themore brittle the material, the more difﬁcult it is to feed it through the nozzle. Thiswould mean that composite materials that use ceramic ﬁllers for example willrequire very precise control of feed rates. The increased modulus would lead tohigher pressure and thus a higher force generated by the pinch rollers. The greatertherefore is the chance of slippage or a mismatch between input and output that would result in non-ﬂow or buckling at the liquiﬁer entry point. 6.2.4 Solidification Once the material is extruded, it should ideally remain the same shape and size.Gravity and surface tension, however, may cause the material to change shape, while size may vary according to cooling and drying effects. If the material isextruded in the form of a gel, the material may shrink upon drying, as well aspossibly becoming porous. If the material is extruded in a molten state, it may alsoshrink when cooling. The cooling is also very likely to be nonlinear. If thisnonlinear effect is signiﬁcant, then it is possible the resulting part will distortupon cooling. This can be minimized by ensuring the temperature differentialbetween the chamber and the surrounding atmosphere is kept to a minimum (i.e., use of a controlled environmental chamber when building the part) and also by ensuring the cooling process is controlled with a gradual and slow proﬁle. It is reasonable to assume that an extrusion-based AM system will extrude from a large chamber to a small nozzle through the use of a conical interface. Asmentioned before, the melt is generally expected to adhere to the walls of theliqueﬁer and nozzle with zero velocity at these boundaries, subjecting the materialto shear deformation during ﬂow. The shear rate _γcan be deﬁned as [ 1] _γ¼/C0 dv drð6:10Þ and the shear stress as6.2 Basic Principles 153τ¼_γ ϕ/C18/C191=m ð6:11Þ where mrepresents the ﬂow exponent and ϕrepresents the ﬂuidity. The general ﬂow characteristic of a material and its deviation from Newtonian behavior isreﬂected in the ﬂow exponent m. 6.2.5 Positional Control Like many AM technologies, extrusion-based systems use a platform that indexes in the vertical direction to allow formation of individual layers. The extrusion headis typically carried on a plotting system that allows movement in the horizontalplane. This plotting must be coordinated with the extrusion rate to ensure smooth and consistent deposition. Since the plotting head represents a mass and therefore contains an inertial element when moving in a speciﬁc direction, any change in direction must resultin a deceleration followed by acceleration. The corresponding material ﬂow ratemust match this change in speed or else too much or too little material will bedeposited in a particular region. For example, if the extrusion head is moving at avelocity vparallel to a nominal xdirection and is then required to describe a right angle so that it then moves at the same velocity vin the perpendicular ydirection, then, at some point the instantaneous velocity will reach zero. If the extrusion rate is not zero at this point, then excess material will be deposited at the corner of thisright angled feature. Since the requirement is to move a mechanical extrusion head in the horizontal plane then the most appropriate mechanism to use would be a standard planarplotting system. This would involve two orthogonally mounted linear drivemechanisms like belt drives or lead-screws. Such drives need to be powerfulenough to move the extrusion chamber at the required velocity and be responsive enough to permit rapid changes in direction without backlash effects. The system must also be sufﬁciently reliable to permit constant movement over many hourswithout any loss in calibration. While cheaper systems often make use of beltsdriven by stepper motors, higher cost systems typically use servo drives with lead-screw technology. Since rapid changes in direction can make it difﬁcult to control material ﬂow, a common strategy would be to draw the outline of the part to be built using a slowerplotting speed to ensure that material ﬂow is maintained at a constant rate. The internal ﬁll pattern can be built more rapidly since the outline represents the external features of the part that corresponds to geometric precision. This outershell also represents a constraining region that will prevent the ﬁller material fromaffecting the overall precision. A typical ﬁll pattern can be seen in Fig. 6.3. Determination of the outline and ﬁll patterns will be covered in a later section ofthis chapter.154 6 Extrusion-Based Systems6.2.6 Bonding For heat-based systems there must be sufﬁcient residual heat energy to activate the surfaces of the adjacent regions, causing bonding. Alternatively, gel or paste-basedsystems must contain residual solvent or wetting agent in the extruded ﬁlament toensure the new material will bond to the adjacent regions that have already beendeposited. In both cases, we visualize the process in terms of energy supplied to thematerial by the extrusion head. If there is insufﬁcient energy, the regions may adhere, but there would be a distinct boundary between new and previously deposited material. This can repre- sent a fracture surface where the materials can be easily separated. Too muchenergy may cause the previously deposited material to ﬂow, which in turn mayresult in a poorly deﬁned part. Once the material has been extruded, it must solidify and bond with adjacent material. Yardimci deﬁned a set of governing equations that describe the thermalprocesses at work in a simple extruded road, laid down in a continuous, open-endedfashion along a direction x, based on various material properties [ 5]. ρ ∂q ∂t¼k∂2T ∂x2/C0Sc/C0S1 ð6:12Þ where ρis the material density, qis the speciﬁc enthalpy, and kthe effective thermal conductivity.

There is a critical temperature T cabove which a diffusive bonding process is activated and below which bonding is prohibited. On the basis of this, we can state a bonding potential φas φ¼Zt 0T/C0Tc ðÞ dτ ð6:15Þ 6.2.7 Support Generation All AM systems must have a means for supporting free-standing and disconnected features and for keeping all features of a part in place during the fabrication process.With extrusion-based systems such features must be kept in place by the additional fabrication of supports. Supports in such systems take two general forms: – Similar material supports – Secondary material supports If an extrusion-based system is built in the simplest possible way then it will have only one extrusion chamber. If it has only one chamber then supports must be madeusing the same material as the part. This may require parts and supports to be carefully designed and placed with respect to each other so that they can be separated at a later time. As mentioned earlier, adjustment of the temperature of the partmaterial relative to the adjacent material can result in a fracture surface effect. Thisfracture surface can be used as a means of separating the supports from the partmaterial. One possible way to achieve this may be to change the layer separationdistance when depositing the part material on top of the support material or viceversa. The additional distance can affect the energy transfer sufﬁciently to result inthis fracture phenomenon. Alternatively, adjustment of the chamber or extrusion temperature when extruding supports might be an effective strategy. In all cases however, the support material will be somewhat difﬁcult to separate from the part.156 6 Extrusion-Based SystemsThe most effective way to remove supports from the part is to fabricate them in a different material. The variation in material properties can be exploited so that supports are easily distinguishable from part material, either visually (e.g., using a different color material), mechanically (e.g., using a weaker material for the supports), or chemically (e.g., using a material that can be removed using a solvent without affecting the part material). To do this, the extrusion-based equipment should have a second extruder. In this way, the secondary material can be prepared with the correct build parameters and extruded in parallel with the current layer of build material, without delay. It may be interesting to note that a visually different material, when not used for supports, may also be used to highlight different features within a model, like the bone tumor shown in the medical model of Fig.6.4. 6.3 Plotting and Path Control As with nearly all additive manufacturing systems, extrusion-based machines mostly take input from CAD systems using the generic STL ﬁle format. This ﬁle format enables easy extraction of the slice proﬁle, giving the outline of each slice. As with most systems, the control software must also determine how to ﬁll the material within the outline. This is particularly crucial to this type of system since extrusion heads physically deposit material that ﬁlls previously vacant space. There must be clear access for the extrusion head to deposit ﬁll material within the outline without compromising the material that has already been laid down. Additionally, if the material is not laid down close enough to adjacent material, it will not bond effectively. In contrast, laser-based systems can permit, and in fact generally require, a signiﬁcant amount of overlap from one scan to the next and thus there are no head collision or overﬁlling-equivalent phenomena. As mentioned earlier, part accuracy is maintained by plotting the outline mate- rial ﬁrst, which will then act as a constraining region for the ﬁll material. The outline would generally be plotted with a lower speed to ensure consistent material Fig. 6.4 A medical model made using extrusion-based AM technology from two different color materials, highlighting a bone tumor (courtesy of Stratasys)6.3 Plotting and Path Control 157ﬂow. The outline is determined by extracting intersections between a plane (representing the current cross section of the build) and the triangles in the STLﬁle. These intersections are then ordered so that they form a complete, continuous curve for each outline (there may be any number of these curves, either separate or nested inside of each other, depending upon the geometry of that cross section). Theonly remaining thing for the software to do at this stage is to determine the startlocation for each outline. Since the extrusion nozzle is a ﬁnite diameter, this startlocation is deﬁned by the center of the nozzle. The stop location will be the ﬁnalpoint on this trajectory, located approximately one nozzle diameter from the startlocation. Since it is better to have a slight overlap than a gap and because it is verydifﬁcult to precisely control ﬂow, there is likely to be a slight overﬁll and thus swelling in this start/stop region. If all the start/stop regions are stacked on top of each other, then there will be a “seam” running down the part. In most cases, it isbest to have the start/stop regions randomly or evenly distributed around the part sothat this seam is not obvious. However, a counter to this may be that a seam isinevitable and having it in an obvious region will make it more straightforward forremoving during the post-processing stage. Determining the ﬁll pattern for the interior of the outlines is a much more difﬁcult task for the control software. The ﬁrst consideration is that there must be an offset inside the outline and that the extrusion nozzle must be placed inside this outline with minimal overlap. The software must then establish a start location forthe ﬁll and determine the trajectory according to a predeﬁned ﬁll pattern. This ﬁllpattern is similar to those used in CNC planar pocket milling where a set amount ofmaterial must be removed with a cylindrical cutter [ 5]. As with CNC milling, there is no unique solution to achieving the ﬁlling pattern. Furthermore, the ﬁll patternmay not be a continuous, unbroken trajectory for a particular shape. It is preferableto have as few individual paths as possible but for complex patterns an optimum value may be difﬁcult to establish. As can be seen with even the relatively simple cross section in Fig. 6.3, start and stop locations can be difﬁcult to determine and are somewhat arbitrary. Even with a simpler geometry, like a circle that could be ﬁlledcontinuously using a spiral ﬁll pattern, it is possible to ﬁll from the outside-in orfrom the inside-out. Spiral patterns in CNC are quite common, mainly because it is not quite so important as to how the material is removed from a pocket. However, they are lesscommon as ﬁll patterns for extrusion-based additive manufacturing, primarily for the following reason. Consider the example of building a simple solid cylinder. If a spiral pattern were used, every path on every layer would be directly above eachother. This could severely compromise part strength and a weave pattern would bemuch more preferable. As with composite material weave patterning using materiallike carbon ﬁber, for example, it is better to cross the weave over each other at anangle so that there are no weakened regions due to the directionality in the ﬁbers.Placing extrusion paths over each other in a crossing pattern can help to distributethe strength in each part more evenly. Every additional weave pattern within a speciﬁc layer is going to cause a discontinuity that may result in a weakness within the corresponding part. For158 6 Extrusion-Based Systemscomplex geometries, it is important to minimize the number of ﬁll patterns used in a single layer. As mentioned earlier, and illustrated in Fig. 6.3, it is not possible to ensure that only one continuous ﬁll pattern will successfully ﬁll a single layer. Most outlines can be ﬁlled with a theoretically inﬁnite number of ﬁll pattern solutions. It is therefore unlikely that a software solution will provide the best or optimumsolution in every case, but an efﬁcient solution methodology should be designed toprevent too many separate patterns from being used in a single layer. Parts are weakened as a result of gaps between extruded roads. Since weave patterns achieve the best mechanical properties if they are extruded in a continuouspath, there are many changes in direction. The curvature in the path for thesechanges in direction can result in gaps within the part as illustrated in Fig. 6.5. This ﬁgure illustrates two different ways to deﬁne the toolpath, one that will ensure no additional material will be applied to ensure no part swelling and good partaccuracy. The second approach deﬁnes an overlap that will cause the material toﬂow into the void regions, but which may also cause the part to swell. However, inboth cases gaps are constrained within the outline material laid down at theperimeter. Additionally, by changing the ﬂow rate at these directional changeregions, less or more material can be extruded into these regions to compensatefor gaps and swelling. This means that the material ﬂow from the extrusion head should not be directly proportional to the instantaneous velocity of the head when the velocity is low, but rather should be increased or decreased slightly, dependingon the toolpath strategy used. Furthermore, if the velocity is zero but the machine isknown to be executing a directional change in a weave path, a small amount of ﬂowshould ideally be maintained. This will cause the affected region to swell slightlyand thus help ﬁll gaps. Obviously, care should be taken to ensure that excessmaterial is not extruded to the extent that part geometry is compromised [ 6]. It can be seen that precise control of extrusion is a complex trade-off, dependent on a signiﬁcant number of parameters, including: Actual tool pathKey Deposited material boundary Fig. 6.5 Extrusion of materials to maximize precision ( left) or material strength ( right)b y controlling voids6.3 Plotting and Path Control 159– Input pressure: This variable is changed regularly during a build, as it is tightly coupled with other input control parameters. Changing the input pressure(or force applied to the material) results in a corresponding output ﬂow rate change. A number of other parameters, however, also affect the ﬂow to a lesser degree. – Temperature: Maintaining a constant temperature within the melt inside the chamber would be the ideal situation. However, small ﬂuctuations are inevitableand will cause changes in the ﬂow characteristics. Temperature sensing shouldbe carried out somewhere within the chamber and therefore a loosely coupledparameter can be included in the control model for the input feed pressure tocompensate for thermal variations. As the heat builds up, the pressure should drop slightly to maintain the same ﬂow rate. – Nozzle diameter: This is constant for a particular build, but many extrusion- based systems do allow for interchangeable nozzles that can be used to offsetspeed against precision. – Material characteristics: Ideally, control models should include information regarding the materials used. This would include viscosity information thatwould help in understanding the material ﬂow through the nozzle. Since viscousﬂow, creep, etc. are very difﬁcult to predict, accurately starting and stopping ﬂow can be difﬁcult. – Gravity and other factors: If no pressure is applied to the chamber, it is possible that material will still ﬂow due to the mass of the molten material within thechamber causing a pressure head. This may also be exacerbated by gaseouspressure buildup inside the chamber if it is sealed. Surface tension of the meltand drag forces at the internal surfaces of the nozzle may retard this effect. – Temperature build up within the part: All parts will start to cool down as soon as the material has been extruded. However, different geometries will cool at different rates. Large, massive structures will hold their heat for longer times than smaller, thinner parts, due to the variation in surface to volume ratio. Sincethis may have an effect on the surrounding environment, it may also affectmachine control. Taking these and other factors into consideration can help one better control the ﬂow of material from the nozzle and the corresponding precision of the ﬁnal part.However, other uncontrollable or marginally controllable factors may still prove problematic to precisely control ﬂow. Many extrusion-based systems, for instance, resort to periodically cleaning the nozzles from time to time to prevent build up ofexcess material adhered to the nozzle tip. 6.4 Fused Deposition Modeling from Stratasys By far the most common extrusion-based AM technology is fused depositionmodeling (FDM), produced and developed by Stratasys, USA [ 7]. FDM uses a heating chamber to liquefy polymer that is fed into the system as a ﬁlament. The160 6 Extrusion-Based Systemsﬁlament is pushed into the chamber by a tractor wheel arrangement and it is this pushing that generates the extrusion pressure. A typical FDM machine can be seen in Fig. 6.6, along with a picture of an extrusion head. The initial FDM patent was awarded to Stratasys founder Scott Crump in 1992 and the company has gone from strength to strength to the point where there are more FDM machines than any other AM machine type in the world. The major strength of FDM is in the range of materials and the effective mechanical properties of resulting parts made using this technology. Parts made using FDM are among the strongest for any polymer-based additive manufacturing process. The main drawback to using this technology is the build speed. As mentioned earlier, the inertia of the plotting heads means that the maximum speeds and accelerations that can be obtained are somewhat smaller than other systems. Furthermore, FDM requires material to be plotted in a point-wise, vector fashion that involves many changes in direction. 6.4.1 FDM Machine Types The Stratasys FDM machine range is very wide, from low-cost, small-scale, minimal variable machines through to larger, more versatile, and more sophisti- cated machines that are inevitably more expensive. The company has separated its operations into subsidiaries, each dedicated to different extents of the FDM technology. The ﬁrst subsidiary, Dimension, focuses on the low-cost machines currently starting around $10,000 USD. Each Dimension machine can only process a limited range of materials, with only a few user-controllable parameter options. The Mojo machine is currently the smallest and lowest costing machine, with a maximum part size of 500/C2500/C2500. It has only one layer thickness setting and only one build Fig. 6.6 Typical Stratasys machine showing the outside and the extrusion head inside (courtesy of Stratasys)6.4 Fused Deposition Modeling from Stratasys 161material, with a soluble support system. There are two further machines that are slightly more expensive, with the uPrint going upwards in size to 1000/C21000/C21200 with different layer thickness settings (0.25 and 0.33 mm) and ABS materials available in multiple colors. More expensive variations use the soluble support material while less expensive machines use a single deposition head and breakawaysupports. Finer detail parts can be made using the Elite machine, which has aminimum layer thickness of 0.178 mm. All these machines are designed to operatewith minimal setup, variation, and intervention. They can be located withoutspecial attention to fume extraction and other environmental conditions. Thismeans they can easily be placed in a design ofﬁce rather than resorting to placingthem in a machine shop. Purchasers of Dimension machines would be expected to use them in much the same way as they would an expensive 2D printer. While Dimension FDM machines can be used for making parts for a wide variety of applications, most parts are likely to be used as concept models bycompanies investigating the early stages of product development. More demandingapplications, like for models for ﬁnal product approval, functional testing models,and models for direct digital manufacturing, would perhaps require machines thatare more versatile, with more control over the settings, more material choices andoptions that enable the user to correct minor problems in the output model. Higher speciﬁcation FDM machines are more expensive, not just because of the incorporated technology and increased range of materials, but also because of thesales support, maintenance, and reliability. Stratasys has separated this higher-endtechnology through the subsidiary named FORTUS, with top-of-the-range modelscosting around $400,000 USD. The smaller FORTUS 200mc machine starts offroughly where the Dimension machines end, with a slightly smaller build envelopeof 8 00/C2800/C21200and a similar speciﬁcation. Further up the range are machines with increases in size, accuracy, range of materials, and range of build speeds. The largest and most sophisticated machine is the FORTUS 900mc, which has the highest accuracy of all Stratasys FDM machines with a layer thickness of0.076 mm. The build envelope is an impressive 36 00/C22400/C23600and there are at least seven different material options. It should be noted that FDM machines that operate with different layer thicknesses do so because of the use of different nozzle diameters. These nozzlesare manually changeable and only one nozzle can be used during a speciﬁc build.The nozzle diameter also controls the road width. Obviously, a larger diameter nozzle can extrude more material for a speciﬁc plotting speed and thus shorten the build time at the expense of lower precision. FORTUS software options include the expected ﬁle preparation and build setup options. However, there are also software systems that allow the user to remotelymonitor the build and schedule builds using a multiple machine setup. Stratasys hasmany customers who have purchased more than one machine and their software isaimed at ensuring these customers can operate them with a minimum of userintervention. Much of this support was developed because of another Stratasys subsidiary called Redeye, who use a large number of FDM machines as a service bureau for customers. Much of the operation of Redeye is based on customers162 6 Extrusion-Based Systemslogging in to an Internet account and uploading STL ﬁles. Parts are scheduled for building and sent back to the customer within a few days, depending on part size,amount of ﬁnishing required, and order size. Stratasys also recognizes that many parts coming off their machines will not be immediately suitable for the ﬁnal application and that there may be an amount ofﬁnishing required. To assist in this, Stratasys provides a range of ﬁnishing stationsthat are designed to be compatible with various FDM materials. Finishing can be amixture of chemically induced smoothing (using solvents that lightly melt the partsurface) or burnishing using sodium bicarbonate as a light abrasive cleaningcompound. Also, although there is a range of different material colors for theABS build material, many applications require the application of primers and coatings to achieve the right color and ﬁnish on a part. 6.5 Materials The most popular material is the ABSplus material, which can be used on all current Stratasys FDM machines. This is an updated version of the original ABS (acryloni- trile butadiene styrene) material that was developed for earlier FDM technology. Users interested in a translucent effect may opt for the ABSi material, which hassimilar properties to other materials in the ABS range. Some machines also have anoption for ABS blended with Polycarbonate (PC). Table 6.1shows properties for various ABS materials and blends. These properties are quite similar to many commonly used materials. It should be noted, however, that parts made using these materials on FDM machines mayexhibit regions of lower strength than shown in this table because of interfacial regions in the layers and possible voids in the parts. There are three other materials available for FDM technology that may be useful if the ABS materials cannot fulﬁll the requirements. A material that is predomi-nantly PC-based can provide higher tensile properties, with a ﬂexural strength of Table 6.1 Variations in properties for the ABS range of FDM materials (compiled from Stratasys data sheets) Property ABS ABSi ABSplus ABS/PC Tensile strength (MPa) 22 37 36 34.8 Tensile modulus (MPa) 1,627 1,915 2,265 1,827Elongation (%) 6 3.1 4 4.3Flexural strength (MPa) 41 61 52 50Flexural modulus (MPa) 1,834 1,820 2,198 1,863IZOD impact (J/m 2) 106.78 101.4 96 123 Heat deﬂection at 66 psi (/C14C) 90 87 96 110 Heat deﬂection at 264 psi (/C14C) 76 73 82 96 Thermal expansion (in./in./F) 5.60E /C005 6.7E /C06 4.90E /C005 4.10E /C05 Speciﬁc gravity 1.05 1.08 1.04 1.26.5 Materials 163104 MPa. A variation of this material is the PC-ISO, which is also PC-based, formulated to ISO 10993-1 and USP Class VI requirements. This material, whileweaker than the normal PC with a ﬂexural strength of 90 MPa, is certiﬁed for use in food and drug packaging and medical device manufacture. Another material that has been developed to suit industrial standards is the ULTEM 9085 material. Thishas particularly favorable ﬂame, smoke, and toxicity (FST) ratings that makes itsuitable for use in aircraft, marine, and ground vehicles. If applications requireimproved heat deﬂection, then an option would be to use the Polyphenylsulfone(PPSF) material that has a heat deﬂection temperature at 264 psi of 189 /C14C. It should be noted that these last three materials can only be used in the high-endmachines and that they only work with breakaway support system, making their use somewhat difﬁcult and specialized. The fact that they have numerous ASTM and similar standards attached to their materials indicates that Stratasys is seriouslytargeting ﬁnal product manufacture (Direct Digital Manufacturing) as a key appli-cation for FDM. Note that FDM works best with polymers that are amorphous in nature rather than the highly crystalline polymers that are more suitable for PBF processes. Thisis because the polymers that work best are those that are extruded in a viscous pasterather than in a lower viscosity form. As amorphous polymers, there is no distinct melting point and the material increasingly softens and viscosity lowers with increasing temperature. The viscosity at which these amorphous polymers can beextruded under pressure is high enough that their shape will be largely maintainedafter extrusion, maintaining the extrusion shape and enabling them to solidifyquickly and easily. Furthermore, when material is added in an adjacent road or asa new layer, the previously extruded material can easily bond with it. This isdifferent from Selective Laser Sintering, which relies on high crystallinity in thepowdered material to ensure that there is a distinct material change from the powder state to a liquid state within a well-deﬁned temperature region. 6.6 Limitations of FDM FDM machines made by Stratasys are very successful and meet the demands of many industrial users. This is partly because of the material properties and partlybecause of the low cost of the entry-level machines. There are, however, disadvantages when using this technology, mainly in terms of build speed, accu- racy, and material density. As mentioned earlier, they have a layer thickness optionof 0.078 mm, but this is only available with the highest-cost machine and use of thislevel of precision will lead to longer build times. Note also that all nozzles arecircular and therefore it is impossible to draw sharp external corners; there will be aradius equivalent to that of the nozzle at any corner or edge. Internal corners andedges will also exhibit rounding. The actual shape produced is dependent on thenozzle, acceleration, and deceleration characteristics, and the viscoelastic behavior of the material as it solidiﬁes.164 6 Extrusion-Based SystemsThe speed of an FDM system is reliant on the feed rate and the plotting speed. Feed rate is also dependent on the ability to supply the material and the rate at whichthe liqueﬁer can melt the material and feed it through the nozzle. If the liqueﬁer were modiﬁed to increase the material ﬂow rate, most likely it would result in an increase in mass. This in turn would make it more difﬁcult to move the extrusionhead faster. For precise movement, the plotting system is normally constructedusing a lead-screw arrangement. Lower cost systems can use belt drives, but ﬂexingin the belts make it less accurate and there is also a lower torque reduction to thedrive motor. One method to improve the speed of motor drive systems is to reduce the corresponding friction. Stratasys used Magnadrive technology to move the plotting head on early Quantum machines. By gliding the head on a cushion of air counterbalanced against magnetic forces attracting the head to a steel platen,friction was signiﬁcantly reduced, making it easier to move the heads around at ahigher speed. The fact that this system was replaced by conventional ball screwdrives in the more recent FORTUS 900mc machine indicates that the improvementwas not sufﬁcient to balance against the cost. One method not tried outside the research labs as yet is the use of a particular build strategy that attempts to balance the speed of using thick layers with the precision of using thin layers. The concept here is that thin layers only need to be used on the exterior of a part. The outline of a part can therefore be built using thinlayers, but the interior can be built more quickly using thicker layers, similar to thecyclic build styles described in Chap. 4. Since most FDM machines have two extruder heads, it is possible that one head could have a thicker nozzle than theother. This thicker nozzle may be employed to build support structures and to ﬁll inthe part interior. However, the difﬁculty in maintaining a correct registrationbetween the two layer thicknesses has probably prevented this approach from being developed commercially. A compromise on this solution is to use a honey- comb (or similar) ﬁll pattern that uses less material and take less time. This is onlyappropriate for applications where the reduced mass and strength of such a part isnot an issue. An important design consideration when using FDM is to account for the anisotropic nature of a part’s properties. Additionally, different layering strategiesresult in different strengths. For instance, the right-hand scanning strategy inFig. 6.5creates stronger parts than the left-hand scanning strategy. Typically, properties are isotropic in the x–yplane, but if the raster ﬁll pattern is set to preferentially deposit along a particular direction, then the properties in the x–y plane will also be anisotropic. In almost every case, the strength in the z-direction is measurably less than the strength in the x–yplane. Thus, for parts which undergo stress in a particular direction it is best to build the part such that the major stressaxes are aligned with the x–yplane rather than in the z-direction.6.6 Limitations of FDM 1656.7 Bioextrusion Extrusion-based technology has a large variety of materials that can be processed. If a material can be presented in a liquid form that can quickly solidify, then it issuitable to this process. As mentioned earlier, the creation of this liquid can be either through thermal processing of the material to create a melt, or by using some form of chemical process where the material is in a gel form that can dry out orchemically harden quickly. These techniques are useful for bioextrusion.Bioextrusion is the process of creating biocompatible and/or biodegradablecomponents that are used to generate frameworks, commonly referred to as“scaffolds,” that play host to animal cells for the formation of tissue (tissueengineering). Such scaffolds should be porous, with micropores that allow celladhesion and macropores that provide space for cells to grow. There are a few commercial bioextrusion systems, like the modiﬁed FDM process used by Osteopore [ 8] to create scaffolds to assist in primarily head trauma recovery. This machine uses a conventional FDM-like process with settings for aproprietary material, based on the biocompatible polymer, polycaprolactone (PCL).Most tissue engineering is still, however, in research form; investigating manyaspects of the process, including material choice, structural strength of scaffolds,coatings, biocompatibility, and effectiveness within various clinical scenarios.Many systems are in fact developed in-house to match the speciﬁc interests of the researchers. There are however a small number of systems that are also available commercially to research labs. 6.7.1 Gel Formation One common method of creating scaffolds is to use hydrogels. These are polymersthat are water insoluble but can be dispersed in water. Hydrogels can therefore beextruded in a jelly-like form. Following extrusion, the water can be removed and a solid, porous media remains. Such a media can be very biocompatible and condu- cive to cell growth with low toxicity levels. Hydrogels can be based on naturallyoccurring polymers or synthetic polymers. The natural polymers are perhaps morebiocompatible whereas the synthetic ones are stronger. Synthetic hydrogels arerarely used in tissue engineering, however, because of the use of toxic reagents.Overall, use of hydrogels results in weak scaffolds that may be useful for soft tissuegrowth. 6.7.2 Melt Extrusion Where stronger scaffolds are required, like when used to generate bony tissue, meltextrusion seems to be the process of choice. FDM can be used, but there are somedifﬁculties in using this approach. In particular, FDM is somewhat unsuitablebecause of the expense of the materials. Biocompatible polymers suitable for tissue166 6 Extrusion-Based Systemsengineering are synthesized in relatively small quantities and are therefore only provided at high cost. Furthermore, the polymers often need to be mixed with other materials, like ceramics, that can seriously affect the ﬂow characteristics, causing the material to behave in a non-Newtonian manner. Extrusion using FDM requires the material to be constructed in ﬁlament form that is pushed through the system by a pinch roller feed mechanism. This mechanism may not provide sufﬁcient pressure at the nozzle tip, however, and so many of the experimental systems use screw feed, similar to conventional injection molding and extrusion technology. Screw feed systems beneﬁt from being able to feed small amounts of pellet-based feedstock, enabling one to work with a small material volume. In addition to their layer-wise photopolymerization machines, Envisiontec [ 9] has also developed the 3D-Bioplotter system (see Fig. 6.7). This system is an extrusion-based, screw feeding technology that is designed speciﬁcally for biopolymers. Lower temperature polymers can be extruded using a compressed gas feed, instead of a screw extruder, which results in a much simpler mechanism. Much of the system uses nonreactive stainless steel and the machine itself has a small build envelope and software speciﬁcally aimed at scaffold fabrication. The melt chamber is sealed apart from the nozzle, with a compressed air feed to assist the screw extrusion process. The system uses one extrusion head at a time, with a carousel feeder so that extruders can be swapped at any time during the process. This is particularly useful since most tissue engineering research focuses on build- ing scaffolds with different regions made from different materials. Build parameters can be set for a variety of materials with control over the chamber temperature, feed rate, and plotting speed to provide users with a versatile platform for tissue engineering research. It should be noted that tissue engineering is an extremely complex research area and the construction of physical scaffolds is just the starting point. This approach may result in scaffolds that are comparatively strong compared with hydrogel- based scaffolds, but they may fail in terms of biocompatibility and bio-toxicity. To overcome some of these shortcomings, a signiﬁcant amount of post-processing is required. Fig. 6.7 The Envisiontec 3D Bioplotter system (note the multiple head changing system on the right-hand side)6.7 Bioextrusion 1676.7.3 Scaffold Architectures One of the major limitations with extrusion-based systems for conventional manufacturing applications relates to the diameter of the nozzle. For tissue engi- neering, however, this is not such a limitation. Scaffolds are generally built up so that roads are separated by a set distance so that the scaffold can have a speciﬁc macro porosity. In fact, the aim is to produce scaffolds that are as strong as possible but with as much porosity as possible. The greater the porosity, the more space there is for cells to grow. Scaffolds with greater than 66 % porosity are common. Sometimes, therefore, it may be better to have a thicker nozzle to build stronger scaffold struts. The spacing between these struts can be used to determine the scaffold porosity. The most effective geometry for scaffolds has yet to be determined. For many studies scaffolds with a simple 0/C14and 90/C14orthogonal crossover pattern may be sufﬁcient. More complex patterns vary the number of crossovers and their separa- tion. Examples of typical patterns can be seen in Fig. 6.8. Much of the studies involve ﬁnding out how cells proliferate in these different scaffold architectures and are usually carried out using bioreactors for in vitro (noninvasive) experiments. As such, samples are usually quite small and often cut from a larger scaffold structure. It is anticipated that it will become commonplace for experiments to be carried out using samples that are as large and complex in shape as the bones they are designed to replace and that are implanted in animal or human subjects. Many more funda- mental questions must be answered, however, before this becomes common. 6.8 Other Systems Although Stratasys owns most of the patents on FDM and similar heat-based extrusion technology, there are a number of other such systems commercially available. The majority of these systems can be purchased only in China, until the expiration of Stratasys’ patents. The most successful and well-known system is available from the Beijing Yinhua company. Most of these competing FDM Fig. 6.8 Different scaffold designs showing a porous structure, with an actual image of a scaffold created using a bioextrusion system [ 10]168 6 Extrusion-Based Systemsmachines utilize a screw extrusion system that are fed using powder or pellet feed rather than continuous ﬁlaments. 6.8.1 Contour Crafting In normal additive manufacturing, layers are considered as 2D shapes extrudedlinearly in the third dimension. Thicker layers result in lower part precision,particularly where there are slopes or curves in the vertical direction. A majorinnovative twist on the extrusion-based approach can be found in the ContourCrafting technology developed by Prof. B. Khoshnevis and his team at the Univer-sity of Southern California [ 11]. Taking the principle mentioned above that the exterior surface is the most critical in terms of meeting precision requirements, this research team has developed a method to smooth the surface with a scraping tool.This is similar to how artisans shape clay pottery and/or concrete using trowels. Bycontouring the layers as they are being deposited using the scraping tool tointerpolate between these layers, very thick layers can be made that still replicatethe intended geometry well. Using this technique it is conceptually possible to fabricate extremely large objects very quickly compared with other additive processes, since the exterior precision is no longer determined solely by the layer thickness. The scraper tool need not be a straight edge and can indeed be somewhat reconﬁgurable by posi-tioning different parts of the tool in different regions or by using multiple passes. Toillustrate this advantage the team is in fact developing technology that can producefull-sized buildings using a mixture of the Contour Crafting process and roboticassembly (see Fig. 6.9). 6.8.2 Nonplanar Systems There have been a few attempts at developing AM technology that does not use stratiﬁed, planar layers. The most notable projects are Shaped Deposition Manu-facture (SDM), Ballistic Particle Manufacture (BPM), and Curved LaminatedObject Manufacture (Curved LOM). The Curved LOM [ 12] process in particular aims at using ﬁber-reinforced composite materials, sandwiched together for thepurposes of making tough-shelled components like nose cones for aircraft usingcarbon ﬁber and armored clothing using Kevlar. To work properly, the layers of material must conform to the shape of the part being designed. If edges of laminates are exposed then they can easily come loose by applying shear forces. The CurvedLOM process demonstrated feasibility but also quickly became a very complexsystem that required conformable robotic handling equipment and high poweredlaser cutting for the laminates.6.8 Other Systems 169It is possible to use short ﬁbers mixed with polymer resins in FDM. Fibers can be extruded so long as the diameter and length of the ﬁbers are small enough to prevent clogging of the nozzles. Like Curved LOM, it is somewhat pointless to use such a material in FDM if the layers are aligned with the build plane. However, if the layers were aligned according to the outer layer of the part, then it may be useful. Parts cannot be built using a ﬂat layer approach, in this case, and thus process planning for complex geometries becomes problematic. However, certain parts that require surface toughness can beneﬁt from this nonplanar approach [ 13]. Fig. 6.9 Contour Crafting technology, developed at USC, showing scraping device and large- scale machine170 6 Extrusion-Based Systems6.8.3 FDM of Ceramics Another possible application of FDM is to develop ceramic part fabrication pro- cesses. In particular, FDM can be used to extrude ceramic pastes that can quickly solidify. The resulting parts can be ﬁred using a high-temperature furnace to fuse and densify the ceramic particles. Resulting parts can have very good propertieswith the geometric complexity characteristics of AM processes. Other AM pro-cesses have also been used to create ceramic composites, but most work using FDMcame out of Rutgers University in the USA [ 14]. 6.8.4 Reprap and Fab@home The basic FDM process is quite simple; and this can be illustrated by the develop- ment of two systems that are extremely low cost and capable of being constructedusing minimal tools. The Reprap project [ 15] is essentially an experiment in open source technology. The initial idea was developed by a group at the University of Bath in the UK anddesigns and ideas are being developed by a number of enthusiasts worldwide. One concept being considered is that a machine is capable of producing components for future machines, testing some of the theories of von Neumann on self-replicatingmachines. A large number of design variants exist, some using cold-cure resins butmost using a thermal extrusion head, but all are essentially variants of the FDMprocess, as illustrated by one of these designs shown in Fig. 6.10. Another project that aims at low-cost FDM technology is the Fab@home concept. This uses a frame constructed from laser-cut polymer sheets, assembledlike a 3D jigsaw. Low-cost stepper motors and drives commonly found in ink-jet printers are used for positioning and the extrusion head is normally a compressed- air-fed syringe that contains a variety of cold-cure materials. The Fab@homedesigns can be obtained free of charge and kits can be obtained for assembly at avery low cost. Both of these approaches have inspired a variety of enthusiasts to develop their ideas. Some have focused on improving the designs so that they may be more robustor more versatile. Others have developed software routines that explore things likescanning patterns, more precise control, etc. Yet other enthusiasts have developed new potential applications for this technology, most notably using multiple materials that have unusual chemical or physical behavior. The Fab@home tech-nology has, for example, been used to develop 3D batteries and actuators. Someusers have even experimented with chocolate to create edible sculptures. This development of entry-level AM technology has sparked a 3D Printing revolution that has attracted huge amounts of media attention and brought it intothe public domain. This explosion in interest is covered in more detail in a laterchapter of this book.6.8 Other Systems 1716.9 Exercises Derive an expression for QTso that we can determine the ﬂow through a circular extrusion nozzle. The expression for total ﬂow does not include a gravity coefﬁcient. Derive an expression for QTthat includes gravity, assuming there is a constant amount of material in the melt chamber and the nozzle is pointing vertically downwards. The forces generated by the pinch rollers shown in Fig. 6.1to the elastic modulus. The expressions derived for solidiﬁcation and bonding assume that a thermal process is being used. What do you think the terms will look like if a curing ordrying process were used? Why is extrusion-based AM more suitable for medical scaffold architectures, compared with SLS-fabricated scaffolds made from a similar material? In what ways is extrusion-based AM similar to CNC pocket milling and in what ways is it different?

Recently, however, it has spread to numerous new applicationareas, including electronics packaging, optics, and additive manufacturing.Some of these applications, in fact, have literally taken the technology into a new dimension. The employment of printing technologies in the creation of three-dimensional products has quickly become an extremely promisingmanufacturing practice, both widely studied and increasingly widely used. This chapter will summarize the printing achievements made in the additive manufacturing industry and in academia. The development of printing as aprocess to fabricate 3D parts is summarized, followed by a survey of commercialpolymer printing machines. The focus of this chapter is on material jetting(MJ) in which all of the part material is dispensed from a print head. This is in contrast to binder jetting, where binder or other additive is printed onto a powder bed which forms the bulk of the part. Binder jetting is the subject of Chap. 8. Some of the technical challenges of printing are introduced; material develop-ment for printing polymers, metals, and ceramics is investigated in some detail.Models of the material jetting process are introduced that relate pressurerequired to ﬂuid properties. Additionally, a printing indicator expression isderived and used to analyze printing conditions. 7.1 Evolution of Printing as an Additive Manufacturing Process Two-dimensional inkjet printing has been in existence since the 1960s, used for decades as a method of printing documents and images from computers and other digital devices. Inkjet printing is now widely used in the desktop printing industry, #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_7175commercialized by companies such as HP and Canon. Le [ 1] provides a thorough review of the historical development of the inkjet printing industry. Printing as a three-dimensional building method was ﬁrst demonstrated in the 1980s with patents related to the development of Ballistic Particle Manufacturing, which involved simple deposition of “particles” of material onto an article [ 2]. The ﬁrst commercially successful technology was the ModelMaker from Sanders Pro-totype (now Solidscape), introduced in 1994, which printed a basic wax materialthat was heated to liquid state [ 3]. In 1996, 3D Systems joined the competition with the introduction of the Actua 2100, another wax-based printing machine. The Actuawas revised in 1999 and marketed as the ThermoJet [ 3]. In 2001, Sanders Design International brieﬂy entered the market with its Rapid ToolMaker, but was quickly restrained due to intellectual property conﬂicts with Solidscape [ 3]. It is notable that all of these members of the ﬁrst generation of RP printing machines relied on heatedwaxy thermoplastics as their build material; they are therefore most appropriate forconcept modeling and investment casting patterns. More recently, the focus of development has been on the deposition of acrylate photopolymer, wherein droplets of liquid monomer are formed and then exposed toultraviolet light to promote polymerization. The reliance upon photopolymerizationis similar to that in stereolithography, but other process challenges are signiﬁcantly different. The leading edge of this second wave of machines arrived on the market with the Quadra from Objet Geometries of Israel in 2000, followed quickly by therevised QuadraTempo in 2001. Both machines jetted a photopolymer using printheads with over 1,500 nozzles [ 3]. In 2003, 3D Systems launched a competing technology with its InVision 3D printer. Multi-Jet Modeling, the printing systemused in this machine, was actually an extension of the technology developed withthe ThermoJet line [ 3], despite the change in material solidiﬁcation strategy. The companies continue to innovate, as will be discussed in the next sections. 7.2 Materials for Material Jetting While industry players have so far introduced printing machines that use waxypolymers and acrylic photopolymers exclusively, research groups around the worldhave experimented with the potential for printing machines that could build in thoseand other materials. Among those materials most studied and most promising forfuture applications are polymers, ceramics, and metals. In addition to the commer-cially available materials, this section highlights achievements in related researchareas. For common droplet formation methods, the maximum printable viscosity threshold is generally considered to be in the range of 20–40 centipoise (cP) at the printing temperature [ 4–6]. An equivalent unit of measure is the milli-Pascal- second, denoted mPa s if SI units are preferred. To facilitate jetting, materials thatare solid at room temperature must be heated so that they liquefy. For high viscosityﬂuids, the viscosity of the ﬂuid must be lowered to enable jetting. The mostcommon practices are to use heat or solvents or other low viscosity components176 7 Material Jettingin the ﬂuid. In addition to these methods, it is also possible that in some polymer deposition cases shear thinning might occur, dependent upon the material orsolution in use; drop-on-demand (DOD) printers are expected to produce strain rates of 10 3–104, which should be high enough to produce shear-thinning effects [ 4, 7]. While other factors such as liquid density or surface tension and print head or nozzle design may affect the results, the limitation on viscosity quickly becomes themost problematic aspect for droplet formation in material jetting. 7.2.1 Polymers Polymers consist of an enormous class of materials, representing a wide range ofmechanical properties and applications. And although polymers are the only mate-rial currently used in commercial AM machines, there seems to be relatively littlediscussion on polymer inkjet production of macro three-dimensional structures in the published scientiﬁc literature. Gao and Sonin [ 8] present the ﬁrst notable academic study of the deposition and solidiﬁcation of groups of molten polymer microdrops. They discuss ﬁndingsrelated to three modes of deposition: columnar, sweep (linear), and repeatedsweep (vertical walls). The two materials used in their investigations were acandelilla wax and a microcrystalline petroleum wax, deposited in droplets50μm in diameter from a print head 3–5 mm from a cooled substrate. The authors ﬁrst consider the effects of droplet deposition frequency and cooling on columnar formation. As would be expected, if the drops are deposited rapidly ( /C2150 Hz in this case), the substrate on which they impinge is still at an elevated temperature,reducing the solidiﬁcation contact angle and resulting in ball-like depositionsinstead of columns (Fig. 7.1a). Numerical analyses of the relevant characteristic times of cooling are included. Gao and Sonin also consider horizontal deposition ofdroplets and the subsequent formation of lines. They propose that smooth solid lineswill be formed only in a small range of droplet frequencies, dependent upon thesweep speed, droplet size, and solidiﬁcation contact angle (Fig. 7.1b). Finally, they propose that wall-like deposition will involve a combination of the relevant aspects from each of the above situations. Reis et al. [ 9] also provide some discussion on the linear deposition of droplets. They deposited molten Mobilwax parafﬁn wax with a heated print head fromSolidScape. They varied both the print head horizontal speed and the velocity ofdroplet ﬂight from the nozzle. For low droplet speeds, low sweep speeds createddiscontinuous deposition and high sweep speeds created continuous lines(Fig. 7.2a–c ). High droplet impact speed led to splashing at high sweep speeds and line bulges at low sweep speeds (Fig. 7.2d–f ). From these studies, it is clear that process variables such as print head speed, droplet velocity, and droplet frequency affect the quality of the deposit. Theseprocess variables vary depending upon the characteristics of the ﬂuid being printed,so some process development, or ﬁne-tuning, is generally required when trying toprint a new material or develop a new printing technology.7.2 Materials for Material Jetting 177Feng et al. [ 10] ﬁnally present a full system, based on a print head from MicroFab Technologies Inc. that functions similarly to the commercially available machines. It prints a wax material which is heated to 80/C14C, more than 10/C14past its melting point, and deposits it in layers 13–60 μm thick. The deposition pattern is controlled by varying the droplet size and velocity, as well as the pitch and hatch 500 Deposition frequency/Hz200 100 50 30 20 15 10 7 0/ (Hz) 235 330340 375470 690 935 1128 1428 1724 2000 2500 Fig. 7.1 (a) Columnar formation and ( b) line formation as functions of droplet impingement frequency [ 8] Fig. 7.2 Results of varying sweep and impact speeds [ 9]178 7 Material Jettingspacing of the lines produced. An example of the result, a 2.5-dimensional gear, is presented in Fig. 7.3. The earliest and most often used solution to the problem of high viscosity is to heat the material until its viscosity drops to an acceptable point. As discussed in Sect. 7.5, for example, commercial machines such as 3D Systems’ ThermoJet and Solidscape’s T66 all print proprietary thermoplastics, which contain mixtures of various waxes and polymers that are solid at ambient temperatures but convert to a liquid phase at elevated printing temperatures [ 11]. In developing their hot melt materials, for example, 3D Systems investigated various mixtures consisting of a low shrinkage polymer resin, a low viscosity material such as parafﬁn wax, a microcrystalline wax, a toughening polymer, and a small amount of plasticizer, with the possible additions of antioxidants, coloring agents, or heat dissipating ﬁller [12]. These materials were formulated to have a viscosity of 18–25 cP and a surface tension of 24–29 dyn/cm at the printing temperature of 130/C14C. De Gans et al. [ 13] contend that they have used a micropipette optimized for polymer printing applications that was able to print Newtonian ﬂuids with viscosities up to 160 cP. The most recent development in addressing the issues of viscosity is the use of prepolymers in the fabrication of polymer parts. This is the method currently employed by the two newest commercially available machine lines, as discussed in Sect. 7.5. For example, 3D Systems investigated a series of UV-curable printing materials, consisting of mixtures of high-molecular weight monomers and oligomers such as urethane acrylate or methacrylate resins, urethane waxes, low molecular weight monomers and oligomers such as acrylates or methacrylates that function as diluents, a small amount of photoinitiators, and other additives such as stabilizers, surfactants, pigments, or ﬁllers [ 14,15]. These materials also beneﬁted from the effects of hot melt deposition, as they were printed at a temperature of 70– 95/C14C, with melting points between 45 and 65/C14C. At the printing temperatures, these materials had a viscosity of about 10–16 cP. Fig. 7.3 Wax gear [ 10]7.2 Materials for Material Jetting 179One problem encountered, and the reason that the printing temperatures cannot be as high as those used in hot melt deposition, is that when kept in the heated state for extended periods of time, the prepolymers begin to polymerize, raising the viscosity and possibly clogging the nozzles when they are ﬁnally printed [15]. Another complication is that the polymerization reaction, which occurs after printing, must be carefully controlled to assure dimensional accuracy. 7.2.2 Ceramics One signiﬁcant advance in terms of direct printing for three-dimensional structures has been achieved in the area of ceramic suspensions. As in the case of polymers, studies have been conducted that investigate the basic effects of modifying sweep speed, drop-to-drop spacing, substrate material, line spacing, and simple multilayer forms in the deposition of ceramics [ 16]. These experiments were conducted with a mixture of zirconia powder, solvent, and other additives, which was printed from a 62μm nozzle onto substrates 6.5 mm away. The authors found that on substrates that permitted substantial spreading of the deposited materials, neighboring drops would merge to form single, larger shapes, whereas on other substrates the individual dots would remain independent (see Fig. 7.4). In examples where multiple layers were printed, the resulting deposition was uneven, with ridges and valleys throughout. A sizable body of work has been amassed in which suspensions of alumina particles are printed via a wax carrier [ 4] which is melted by the print head. Suspensions of up to 40 % solids loading have been successfully deposited at viscosities of 2.9–38.0 cP at a measurement temperature of 100/C14C; higher concentrations of the suspended powder have resulted in prohibitively high viscosities. Because this deposition method results in a part with only partial ceramic density, the green part must be burnt out and sintered, resulting in a ﬁnal product which is 80 % dense but whose dimensions are subject to dramatic shrinkage [ 17]. A part created in this manner is shown in Fig. 7.5. Fig. 7.4 Droplets on two different substrates [ 16]180 7 Material JettingSimilar attempts have been made with zirconia powder, using material with 14 % ceramic content by volume [ 18], with an example shown in Fig. 7.6, as well as with PZT, up to 40 % ceramic particles by volume [ 19]. 7.2.3 Metals Much of the printing work related to metals has focused upon the use of printing for electronics applications—formation of traces, connections, and soldering. Liu and Orme [ 20] present an overview of the progress made in solder droplet deposition for the electronics industry. Because solder has a low melting point, it is an obvious choice as a material for printing. They reported use of droplets of 25–500 μm, with Fig. 7.5 Sintered alumina impeller [ 17] Fig. 7.6 Sintered zirconia vertical walls [ 18]7.2 Materials for Material Jetting 181results such as the IC test board in Fig. 7.7, which has 70 μm droplets of Sn63/Pb37. In related work, a solder was jetted whose viscosity was approximately 1.3 cP, continuously jetted under a pressure of 138 kPa. Many of the results to which they refer are those of researchers at MicroFab Technologies, who have also produced solder forms such as 25 μm diameter columns. There is, however, some work in true three-dimensional fabrication with metals. Priest et al. [ 21] provide a survey of liquid metal printing technologies and history, including alternative technologies employed and ongoing research initiatives. Metals that had been printed included copper, aluminum, tin, various solders, and mercury. One major challenge identiﬁed for depositing metals is that the melting point of the material is often high enough to signiﬁcantly damage components of the printing system. Orme et al. [ 22,23] report on a process that uses droplets of Rose’s metal (an alloy of bismuth, lead, and tin). They employ nozzles of diameter 25–150 μm with resulting droplets of 47–283 μm. In speciﬁc cases, parts with porosity as low as 0.03 % were formed without post-processing, and the microstructure formed is more uniform than that of standard casting. In discussion of this technology, considerations of jet disturbance, aerodynamic travel, and thermal effects are all presented. Yamaguchi et al. [ 24,25] used a piezoelectrically driven actuator to deposit droplets of an alloy (Bi–Pb–Sn–Cd–In), whose melting point was 47/C14C. They heated the material to 55/C14C and ejected it from nozzles 200 μm, 50 μm, and less than 8 μm in diameter. As expected, the ﬁner droplets created parts with better resolution. The density, or “packing rate,” of some parts reached 98 %. Other examples of fabricated parts are shown in Fig. 7.8. Fig. 7.7 IC test board with solder droplets [ 20]182 7 Material JettingMore recently, several research groups have demonstrated aluminum deposition [26,27]. In one example, near-net shape components, with fairly simple shapes, have been formed from Al2024 alloy printed from a 100 μm oriﬁce. In another example, pressure pulses of argon gas in the range of 20–100 kPa were used to eject droplets of molten aluminum at the rate of 1–5 drops per second. To achieve this, the aluminum was melted at 750/C14C and the substrate to 300/C14C. The nozzle oriﬁce used was 0.3 mm in diameter, with a resulting droplet size of 200–500 μm and a deposited line of width 1.00 mm and thickness 0.17 mm. The ﬁnal product was a near-net shape part of density up to 92 %. As these examples have shown, printing is well on its way to becoming a viable process for three-dimensional prototyping and manufacturing. While industry has only barely begun to use printing in this arena, the economic and efﬁciency advantages that printing provide ensure that it will be pursued extensively in the future. Researchers in academia have expanded the use of printing to materials such as ceramics and metals, thus providing additional prospective applications for the technology. Despite its great potential, however, the growth of printing has been hampered signiﬁcantly by technical challenges inherent to the printing process. These challenges and possible solutions are investigated in subsequent sections. 7.2.4 Solution- and Dispersion-Based Deposition As hot melt deposition has very speciﬁc requirements for the material properties of what is printed, many current applications have turned to solution- or dispersion- based deposition. This allows the delivery of solids or high-molecular weight polymers in a carrier liquid of viscosity low enough to be successfully printed. De Gans et al. [ 5] provided a review of a number of polymeric applications in which this strategy is employed. A number of investigators have used solution and dispersion techniques in accurate deposition of very small amounts of polymer in thin layers for mesoscale applications, such as polymer light-emitting displays, electronic components, and surface coatings and masks. For example, Shimoda et al. [ 28] present a technique to develop light-emitting polymer diode displays using inkjet deposition of conduc- tive polymers. Three different electroluminescent polymers (polyﬂuorine and two Fig. 7.8 Examples of parts fabricated with metal printing [ 25]7.2 Materials for Material Jetting 183derivatives) were printed in organic solvents at 1–2 wt%. As another example, De Gans et al. [ 5] report a number of other results related to the creation of polymer light-emitting displays: a precursor of poly( p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) was printed as a 0.3 wt% solution; and PPV derivatives were printed in 0.5–2.0 wt% solutions in solvents such as tetraline, anisole, and o-xylene. Such low weightpercentages are typical. In deposition of ceramics, the use of a low viscosity carrier is also a popular approach. Tay and Edirisinghe [ 16], for example, used ceramic powder dispersed in industrial methylated spirit with dispersant, binder, and plasticizer additivesresulting in a material that was 4.5 % zirconia by volume. The resulting materialhad a viscosity of 3.0 cP at 20 /C14C and a shear rate of 1,000 s/C01. Zhao et al. [ 29] tested various combinations of zirconia and wax carried in octane and isopropyl alcohol, with a dispersant added to reduce sedimentation. The viscosities of thesematerials were 0.6–2.9 cP at 25 /C14C; the one ﬁnally selected was 14.2 % zirconia by volume. Despite the success of solution and dispersion deposition for these speciﬁc applications, however, there are some serious drawbacks, especially in consideringthe potential for building complex, large, 3D components. The low concentrationsof polymer and solid used in the solutions and dispersions will restrict the total amount of material that can be deposited. Additionally, it can be difﬁcult to control the deposition pattern of this material within the area of the droplet’s impact.Shimoda et al. [ 28], among others, report the formation of rings of deposited material around the edge of the droplet. They attribute this to the fact that thecontact line of the drying drop is pinned on the substrate. As the liquid evaporatesfrom the edges, it is replenished from the interior, carrying the solutes to the edge.They contend that this effect can be mitigated by control of the droplet dryingconditions. Another difﬁculty with solutions or dispersions, especially those based on volatile solvents, is that use of these materials can result in precipitations formingin the nozzle after a very short period of time [ 13], which can clog the nozzle, making deposition unreliable or impossible. 7.3 Material Processing Fundamentals 7.3.1 Technical Challenges of MJ As evidenced by the industry and research applications discussed in the previoussection, material jetting already has a strong foothold in terms of becoming asuccessful AM technology. There are, however, some serious technicalshortcomings that have prevented its development from further growth. To identifyand address those problems, the relevant phenomena and strategic approaches takenby its developers must be understood. In the next two sections, the technical challenges of the printing process are outlined, the most important of its limitations184 7 Material Jettingrelevant to the deposition of functional polymers are identiﬁed, and how those limitations are currently addressed is summarized. Jetting for three-dimensional fabrication is an extremely complex process, with challenging technical issues throughout. The ﬁrst of these challenges is formulation of the liquid material. If the material is not in liquid form to begin with, this maymean suspending particles in a carrier liquid, dissolving materials in a solvent,melting a solid polymer, or mixing a formulation of monomer or prepolymer with apolymerization initiator. In many cases, other substances such as surfactants areadded to the liquid to attain acceptable characteristics. Entire industries are devotedto the mixture of inks for two-dimensional printing, and it is reasonable to assumethat in the future this will also be the case for three-dimensional fabrication. The second hurdle to overcome is droplet formation. To use inkjet deposition methods, the material must be converted from a continuous volume of liquid into anumber of small discrete droplets. This function is often dependent upon a ﬁnelytuned relationship between the material being printed, the hardware involved, andthe process parameters; a number of methods of achieving droplet formation arediscussed in this section. Small changes to the material, such as the addition of tinyparticles [ 30], can dramatically change its droplet forming behavior as well, as can changes to the physical setup. A third challenge is control of the deposition of these droplets; this involves issues of droplet ﬂight path, impact, and substrate wetting or interaction [ 31–35]. In printing processes, either the print head or the substrate is usually moving, so thecalculation of the trajectory of the droplets must take this issue into account. Inaddition to the location of the droplets’ arrival, droplet velocity and size will alsoaffect the deposition characteristics and must be measured and controlled via nozzledesign and operation [ 36]. The quality of the impacted droplet must also be controlled: if smaller droplets, called satellites, break off from the main droplet during ﬂight, then the deposited material will be spread over a larger area than intended and the deposition will not have well-deﬁned boundaries. In the same way,if the droplet splashes on impact, forming what is called a “crown,” similar resultswill occur [ 37]. All of the effects will negatively impact the print quality of the printed material. Concurrently, the conversion of the liquid material droplets to solid geometry must be carefully controlled; as discussed in Sect. 7.2, material jetting relies on a phase change of the printed material. Examples of phase change modes employed in existing printing technologies are: solidiﬁcation of a melted material (e.g., wax, solder), evaporation of the liquid portion of a solution (e.g., some ceramicapproaches), and curing of a photopolymer (e.g., Objet, ProJet machines) or otherchemical reactions. The phase change must occur either during droplet ﬂight orsoon after impact; the time and place of this conversion will also affect the droplet’sinteraction with the substrate [ 38,39] and the ﬁnal deposition created. To further complicate the matter, drops may solidify nonuniformly, creating warpage andother undesirable results [ 40]. An additional challenge is to control the deposition of droplets on top of previously deposited layers, rather than only upon the initial substrate7.3 Material Processing Fundamentals 185[8,16]. The droplets will interact differently, for example, with a metal plate substrate than with a surface of previously printed wax droplets. To create substan-tive three-dimensional parts, each layer deposited must be fully bound to the previous layer to prevent delamination, but must not damage that layer while being created. Commercially available machines tend to approach this problem byemploying devices that plane or otherwise smooth the surface periodically [ 40–42]. Operational considerations also pose a challenge in process planning for MJ. For example, because nozzles are so small, they often clog, preventing droplets fromexiting. Much attention has been given to monitoring and maintaining nozzleperformance during operation [ 40]. Most machines currently in use go through purge and cleaning cycles during their builds to keep as many nozzles open as possible; they may also wipe the nozzles periodically [ 41]. Some machines may also employ complex sensing systems to identify and compensate formalfunctioning or inconsistent nozzles [ 43,44]. In addition, many machines, including all commercial AM machines, have replaceable nozzles in case ofpermanent blockage. Finally, to achieve the best print resolution, it is advantageous to produce many small droplets very close together. However, this requires high nozzle density in theprint head, which is unattainable for many nozzle manufacturing processes. An alternative to nozzle density is to make multiple passes over the same area, effectively using process planning instead of hardware to create the desired effect[41]. Even in cases where high nozzle density is possible, however, problems arise due to crosstalk—basically an “overlapping” of the thermal or pressure differentialsused to drive adjacent nozzles. In approaching a printing process, these numerous challenges must in some sense be addressed sequentially: ﬂight pattern cannot be studied until droplets areformed and layering cannot be investigated until deposition of single droplets is controlled. In terms of functional polymer deposition, the challenge of material preparation has effectively been addressed; numerous polymer resins and mixturesalready exist. It is the second challenge—droplet formation—that is therefore thecurrent limiting factor in deposition of these materials. To understand theselimitations, Sect. 7.3.2 reviews the dynamic processes that are currently used to form droplets and Sect. 7.2considered necessary methods of modifying the jetting material for use with those processes. 7.3.2 Droplet Formation Technologies Over the time that two-dimensional inkjet printing has evolved, a number of methods for creating and expelling droplets have been developed. The main distinction in categorizing the most common of technologies refers to the possiblemodes of expulsion: continuous stream (CS) and DOD. This distinction refers to theform in which the liquid exits the nozzle—as either a continuous column of liquidor as discrete droplets. Figure 7.9shows the distinction between continuous (left) and DOD (right) formations.186 7 Material Jetting7.3.3 Continuous Mode In CS mode, a steady pressure is applied to the ﬂuid reservoir, causing a pressurized column of ﬂuid to be ejected from the nozzle. After departing the nozzle, this stream breaks into droplets due to Rayleigh instability. The breakup can be made more consistent by vibrating, perturbing, or modulating the jet at a ﬁxed frequency close to the spontaneous droplet formation rate, in which case the droplet formation process is synchronized with the forced vibration, and ink droplets of uniform mass are ejected [ 45]. Because droplets are produced at constant intervals, their deposi- tion must be controlled after they separate from the jet. To achieve this, they are introduced to a charging ﬁeld and thus attain an electrostatic charge. These charged particles then pass through a deﬂection ﬁeld, which directs the particles to their desired destinations—either a location on the substrate or a container of material to be recycled or disposed. Figure 7.10 shows a schematic of the function of this type of binary deﬂection continuous system. An advantage of CS deposition is the high throughput rate; it has therefore seen widespread use in applications such as food and pharmaceutical labeling [ 5]. Two major constraints related to this method of droplet formation are, however, that the materials must be able to carry a charge and that the ﬂuid deﬂected into the catcher must be either disposed of or reprocessed, causing problems in cases where the ﬂuid is costly or where waste management is an issue. In terms of droplets formed, commercially available systems typically generate droplets that are about 150 μm in diameter at a rate of 80–100 kHz, but frequencies of up to 1 MHz and droplet sizes ranging from 6 μm (10 fL) to 1 mm (0.5 μL) have been reported [ 46]. It has also been shown that, in general, droplets formed from continuous jets are almost twice the diameter of the undisturbed jet [ 47]. Fig. 7.9 Continuous ( left) and drop-on-demand ( right) deposition [ 46]7.3 Material Processing Fundamentals 187A few investigators of three-dimensional deposition have opted to use continu- ous printing methods. Blazdell et al. [ 48] used a continuous printer from Biodot, which was modulated at 66 kHz while ejecting ceramic ink from 50 and 75 μm nozzles. They used 280 kPa of air pressure. Blazdell [ 49] reports later results in which this Biodot system was modulated at 64 kHz, using a 60 μm nozzle that was also 60 μm in length. For much of the development of the 3D Printing binder jetting process, CS deposition was used. At present, the commercial machines based on3DP (from 3D Systems and Ex One) use standard DOD print heads. In metalfabrication, Tseng et al. [ 50] used a continuous jet in depositing their solder alloy, which had a viscosity of about 2 cP at the printing temperature. Ormeet al. [ 22,23] also report the use of an unspeciﬁed continuous system in deposition of solders and metals. 7.3.4 DOD Mode In DOD mode, in contrast, individual droplets are produced directly from thenozzle. Droplets are formed only when individual pressure pulses in the nozzle cause the ﬂuid to be expelled; these pressure pulses are created at speciﬁc times by thermal, electrostatic, piezoelectric, acoustic, or other actuators [ 1]. Figure 7.11 shows the basic functions of a DOD setup. Liu and Orme [ 20] assert that DOD methods can deposit droplets of 25–120 μm at a rate of 0–2,000 drops per second. In the current DOD printing industry, thermal (bubble-jet) and piezoelectric actuator technologies dominate; these are shown in Fig. 7.12.

Piezoelectric actuators rely upon the deforma-tion of a piezoelectric element to reduce the volume of the liquid reservoir, which causes a droplet to be ejected. As noted by Basaran [ 51], the waveforms employed in piezoelectrically driven DOD systems can vary from simple positive squarewaves to complex negative–positive–negative waves in which the amplitude,duration, and other parameters are carefully modulated to create the droplets asdesired. In their review of polymer deposition, De Gans et al. [ 5] assert that DOD is the preferable method for all applications that they discuss due to its smaller drop size(often of diameter similar to the oriﬁce) and higher placement accuracy in compar- ison to CS methods. They further argue that piezoelectric DOD is more widely applicable than thermal because it does not rely on the formation of a vapor bubbleor on heating that can damage sensitive materials. The preference for piezoelectrically driven DOD printing is reﬂected in the number of investigators who use and study such setups. For example, Gao andSonin [ 8] use this technology to deposit 50 μm droplets of two waxes, whose viscosity at 100 /C14C is about 16 cP. Sirringhaus et al. [ 52] and Shimoda et al. [ 28] both use piezoelectric DOD deposition for polymer solutions, as discussed in Sect. 7.2.1 . In ceramic deposition, Reis et al. [ 9] print mixtures with viscosities 6.5 and 14.5 cP at 100/C14C and frequencies of 6–20 kHz. Yamaguchi et al. [ 24,25] also used a piezoelectrically driven DOD device at frequencies up to 20 Hz in thedeposition of metal droplets. Similarly, the solder droplets on the circuit board inFig.7.7were also deposited with a DOD system. At present, all commercial AM printing machines use DOD print heads, gener- ally from a major manufacturer of printers or printing technologies. Suchcompanies include Hewlett-Packard, Canon, Dimatix, Konica-Minolta, and Xaar. 7.3.5 Other Droplet Formation Methods Aside from the standard CS and DOD methods, other technologies have beenexperimentally investigated but have not enjoyed widespread use in industryapplications. Liquid spark jetting, a relative of thermal printing, relies on anelectrical spark discharge instead of a resistor to form a gas bubble in the reservoir[45,52]. The electrohydrodynamic inkjet employs an extremely powerful electric ﬁeld to pull a meniscus and, under very speciﬁc conditions, droplets from apressure-controlled capillary tube; these droplets are signiﬁcantly smaller than thetube from which they emanate. Electro-rheological ﬂuid jetting uses an ink whose properties change under high electric ﬁelds; the ﬂuid ﬂows only when the electric ﬁeld is turned off [ 53]. In their ﬂextensional ultrasound droplet ejectors, Percin and Khuri-Yakub [ 54] demonstrate both DOD and continuous droplet formation with a system in which a plate containing the nozzle oriﬁce acts as the actuator, vibratingat resonant frequencies and forming droplets by creating capillary waves on theliquid surface as well as an increased pressure in the liquid. Focused acoustic beam190 7 Material Jettingejection uses a lens to focus an ultrasound beam onto the free surface of a ﬂuid, using the acoustic pressure transient generated by the focused tone burst to eject aﬂuid droplet [ 55]. Meacham et al. extended this work [ 56] to develop an inexpen- sive ultrasonic droplet generator and developed a fundamental understanding of its droplet formation mechanisms [ 57]. These ultrasonic droplet generators show promise in ejecting viscous polymers [ 58]. Fukumoto et al. [ 59] present a variant technology in which ultrasonic waves are focused onto the surface of the liquid,forming surface waves that eventually break off into a mist of small droplets.Overviews of these various droplet formation methods are given by Lee [ 53] and Basaran [ 51]. Summary : While the general challenges of material jetting for three-dimensional fabrication are identiﬁed, there are many aspects that are not well or fully under- stood. Open research questions abound in almost all stages of the printing process—droplet formation, deposition control, and multilayer accumulation. For the case ofpolymer jetting, the most appropriate limitation to address is that of dropletformation. Because systems developed for inviscid materials are being used forthese applications, numerous accommodations and limitations currently exist; userscommonly handle this by modifying the materials to ﬁt the requirements of theexisting hardware. However, if the method of droplet formulation could be modiﬁed instead, this might allow the deposition of a wider range of materials. A recently developed acoustic focusing ultrasonic droplet generator, under investiga-tion at Georgia Institute of Technology, employs a strategy different from those ofexisting technologies, which may provide the capabilities to fulﬁll this need [ 60]. 7.4 MJ Process Modeling Conservation of energy concepts provides an appropriate context for investigating droplet generation mechanisms for printing. Essentially, the energy imparted by theactuation method to the liquid must be sufﬁcient to balance three requirements:ﬂuid ﬂow losses, surface energy, and kinetic energy. The losses originate from aconversion of kinetic energy to thermal energy due to the viscosity of the ﬂuidwithin the nozzle; this conversion can be thought of as a result of internal friction ofthe liquid. The surface energy requirement is the additional energy needed to formthe free surface of the droplet or jet. Finally, the resulting droplet or jet must still retain enough kinetic energy to propel the liquid from the nozzle towards the substrate. This energy conservation can be summarized as E imparted ¼ElossþEsurfaceþEkinetic ð7:1Þ The conservation law can be considered in the form of actual energy calculations or in the form of pressure, or energy per unit volume, calculations. For example,Sweet used the following approximation for the gauge pressure required in thereservoir of a continuous jetting system [ 61]:7.4 MJ Process Modeling 191Δp¼32μd2 jvjZl2 l1dl d4 nþ2σ djþρv2 j 2ð7:2Þ where, Δpis the total gauge pressure required, μis the dynamic viscosity of the liquid, ρis the liquid’s density, σis the liquid’s surface tension, djis the diameter of the resultant jet, dnis the inner diameter of the nozzle or supply tubing, vjis the velocity of the resultant jet, and lis the length of the nozzle or supply tubing. The ﬁrst term on the right of ( 7.2) is an approximation of the pressure loss due to viscous friction within the nozzle and supply tubing. The second term is the internalpressure of the jet due to surface tension and the third term is the pressure required to provide the kinetic energy of the droplet or jet. Energy conservation can also be thought of as a balance among the effects before the ﬂuid crosses a boundary at the oriﬁce of the nozzle and after it crosses thatboundary. Before the ﬂuid leaves the nozzle, the positive effect of the drivingpressure gradient accelerates it, but energy losses due to viscous ﬂow decelerateit. The kinetic energy with which it leaves the nozzle must be enough to cover thekinetic energy of the traveling ﬂuid as well as the surface energy of the new freesurface. As indicated earlier, actuation energy is typically in the form of heating (bubble- jet) or vibration of a piezoelectric actuator. Various electrical energy waveformsmay be used for actuation. In any event, these are standard types of inputs and willnot be discussed further. While the liquid to be ejected travels through the nozzle, before forming droplets, its motion is governed by the standard equations for incompressible,Newtonian ﬂuids, as we are assuming these ﬂows to be. The ﬂow is fully describedby the Navier–Stokes and continuity equations; however, these equations are difﬁcult to solve analytically, so we will proceed with a simpliﬁcation. The ﬁrst term on the right side of ( 7.2) takes advantage of one situation for which an analytical solution is possible, that of steady, incompressible, laminar ﬂow througha straight circular tube of constant cross section. The solution is the Hagen–Poiseuille law [ 62], which reﬂects the viscous losses due to wall effects: Δp¼ 8Qμl πr4σð7:3Þ where Qis the ﬂow rate and ris the tube radius. Note that this expression is most applicable when the nozzle is a long, narrow glass tube. However, it can also applywhen the ﬂuid is viscous, as we will see shortly. Another assumption made by using the Hagen–Poiseuille equation is that the ﬂow within the nozzle is fully developed. For the case of laminar ﬂow in acylindrical pipe, the length of the entry region l ewhere ﬂow is not yet fully developed is deﬁned as 0.06 times the diameter of the pipe, multiplied by theReynolds number [ 62]:192 7 Material Jettingle¼0:06dRe¼0:06ρvd2 μð7:4Þ where vis the average ﬂow velocity across the pipe. To appreciate the magnitude of this effect, consider printing with a 20 μm nozzle in a plate that is 0.1 mm thick, where the droplet ejection speed is 10 m/s. The entry lengths for a ﬂuid with the density of water and varying viscosities are shown in Table 7.1. Entry lengths are a small fraction of the nozzle length for ﬂuids with viscosities of 40 cP or greater. As a result, we can conclude that ﬂows are fully developedthrough most of a nozzle for ﬂuids that are at the higher end of the range of printableviscosities. Most readers will have encountered the primary concepts of ﬂuid mechanics in an undergraduate course and may be familiar with the Navier–Stokes equation, viscosity, surface tension, etc. As a reminder, viscosity is a measure of the resis- tance of a ﬂuid to being deformed by shear or extensional forces. We will restrictour attention to dynamic, or absolute, viscosity, which has units of pressure-time; inthe SI system, units are typically Pa · s or mPa s, for milli-Pascals /C1seconds. Viscos- ity is also given in units of poise or centipoises, named after Jean Louis MariePoiseuille. Centipoise is abbreviated cP, which conveniently has the same magni-tude as mPa s. That is, 1 cP is equal to 1 mPa s. Surface tension is given in units offorce per length, or energy per unit area; in the SI system, surface tension often has units of N/m or J/m We can investigate the printing situation further by computing the pressures required for ejection. Equation ( 7.3) will be used to compute the pressure required to print droplets for various ﬂuid viscosities and nozzle diameters. For manyprinting situations, wall friction dominates the forces required to print, hence wewill only investigate the ﬁrst term on the right of ( 7.2) and ignore the second and third terms (which are at least one order of magnitude smaller than wall friction). Figure 7.13 shows how the pressure required to overcome wall friction varies with ﬂuid viscosity and nozzle diameter. As can be seen, pressure needs to increase sharply as nozzles vary from 0.1 to 0.02 mm in diameter. This could be expected,given the quadratic dependence of pressure on diameter in ( 7.3). Pressure is seen toTable 7.1 Entry lengths for “water” at various viscositiesViscosity (cP) Density (kg/m3) Entry length ( μm) 1 1,000 240 1,250 300 10 1,000 24 1,250 30 40 1,000 6 1,250 7.5 100 1,000 2.4 1,250 3 200 1,000 1.2 1,250 1.57.4 MJ Process Modeling 193increase linearly with viscosity, which again can be expected from ( 7.3). As indicated, wall friction dominates for many printing condition. However, as nozzlesize increases, the surface tension of the ﬂuid becomes more important. Also, asviscosity increases, viscous losses become important, as viscous ﬂuids can absorbconsiderable acoustic energy. Regardless, this analysis provides good insight intopressure variations under many typical printing conditions. Fluid ﬂows when printing are almost always laminar; i.e., the Reynolds number is less than 2,100. As a reminder, the Reynolds number is Re¼ ρvr μð7:5Þ Another dimensionless number of relevance in printing is the Weber number, which describes the relative importance of a ﬂuid’s inertia compared with itssurface tension. The expression for the Weber number is: We¼ρv2r γð7:6Þ Several research groups have determined that a combination of the Reynolds and Weber numbers is a particularly good indication of the potential for successfulprinting of a ﬂuid [ 17]. Speciﬁcally, if the ratio of the Reynolds number to the square root of the Weber number has a value between 1 and 10, then it is likely that ejection of the ﬂuid will be successful. This condition will be called the “printingindicator” and is 50 4540353025201510 500 50 100 150 Viscosity [cP]Pressure [MPa] 200dia = 0.02 mm dia = 0.04 mm dia = 0.06 mm dia = 0.10 mm Fig. 7.13 Pressure required to overcome wall friction for printing through nozzles of different diameters194 7 Material Jetting1/C20Re We1=2¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃρrγp μ/C2010 ð7:7Þ The inverse of the printing indicator is another dimensionless number called the Ohnsorge number, that relates viscous and surface tension forces. Note that valuesof this ratio that are low indicate that ﬂows are viscosity limited, while large valuesindicate ﬂows that are dominated by surface tension. The low value of 1 for the printing indicator means that the maximum ﬂuid viscosity should be between 20 and 40 cP. Some examples of Reynolds numbers and printing indicators are given in Table 7.2. For these results, the surface tension is 0.072 N/m, the density is 1,000 kg/m 3(same as water at room temperature), and droplet velocity is 1 m/s. It is important to realize that the printing indicator is a guide, not a law to be followed. Water is usually easy to print through most print heads, regardless of thenozzle size. But the printing indicator predicts that water (with a viscosity of 1 cP) should not be ejectable since its surface tension is too high. We will see in the next section how materials can be modiﬁed in order to make printing feasible. 7.5 Material Jetting Machines The three main companies involved in the development of the RP printing industryare still the main players offering printing-based machines: Solidscape, 3D Systems, and Stratasys (after their merger with Objet Geometries). Solidscape sells the T66 and T612, both descendants of the previous ModelMaker line andbased upon the ﬁrst-generation melted wax technique. Each of these machinesemploys two single jets—one to deposit a thermoplastic part material and one todeposit a waxy support material—to form layers 0.0005 in. thick [ 63]. It should be noted that these machines also ﬂy-cut layers after deposition to ensure that the layerTable 7.2 Reynolds numbers and printing indicator values for some printing conditions Nozzle diameter (mm) Viscosity (cP) Reynolds no.

Because of the slow and accurate build style as well as the waxy materials, these machines are often used to fabricate investmentcastings for the jewelry and dentistry industries. 3D Systems and Stratasys offer machines using the ability to print and cure acrylic photopolymers. Stratasys markets the Eden, Alaris, and Connex series ofprinters. These machines print a number of different acrylic-based photopolymer materials in 0.0006 in. layers from heads containing 1,536 individual nozzles, resulting in rapid, line-wise deposition efﬁciency, as opposed to the slower,point-wise approach used by Solidscape. Each photopolymer layer is cured byultraviolet light immediately as it is printed, producing fully cured models withoutpost-curing. Support structures are built in a gel-like material, which is removed byhand and water jetting [ 64]. See Fig. 7.14 for an illustration of Stratasys’ Polyjet system, which is employed in all Eden machines. The Connex line of machinesprovides multimaterial capability. For several years, only two different photopolymers could be printed at one time; however, by automatically adjusting build styles, the machine can print up to 25 different effective materials by varyingthe relative composition of the two photopolymers. Machines are emerging thatprint increasing numbers of materials. In competition with Stratasys, 3D Systems markets the ProJet printers, which print layers 0.0016 in. thick using heads with hundreds of nozzles, half for partmaterial and half for support material [ 11]. Layers are then ﬂashed with ultraviolet light, which activates the photoinitiated polymerization.

The primary advantages of printing, both direct and binder printing, as an AM process include low cost, highspeed, scalability, ease of building parts in multiple materials, and the capability of printing colors. Printing machines are much lower in cost than other AM machines, particularly the ones that use lasers. In general, printing machines can be assembledfrom standard components (drives, stages, print heads), while other machines havemany more machine-speciﬁc components. High speed and scalability are related:by using print heads with hundreds or thousands of nozzles, it is possible to deposita lot of material quickly and over a considerable area. Scalability in this contextmeans that printing speed can be increased by adding another print head to amachine, a relatively easy task, much easier than adding another laser to a SL or SLS machine. As mentioned, Stratasys markets the Connex machines that print in two or more part materials. One can imagine adding more print heads to increase the capabilityto many different materials and utilizing dithering deposition patterns raise thenumber of effective materials into the hundreds. Compatibility and resolution needto be ensured, but it seems that these kinds of improvements should occur in thenear future. Related to multiple materials, colors can be printed by some commercial AM machines (see Sect. 8.3). The capability of printing in color is an important advance in the AM industry; for many years, parts could only be fabricated in one color. Theonly exception was the selectively colorable SL resins that Huntsman markets forthe medical industry, which were developed in the mid-1990s. These resins werecapable of only two colors, amber and either blue or red. In contrast, two companiesmarket AM machines that print in high resolution 24-bit color. Several companiesare using these machines to produce ﬁgurines for video-gamers and otherconsumers (see Chaps. 3,8, and 12). For completeness, a few disadvantages of MJ will provide a more balanced presentation. The choice of materials to date is limited. Only waxes andphotopolymers are commercially available. Part accuracy, particularly for largeparts, is generally not as good as with some other processes, notably vat photopoly-merization and material extrusion. However, accuracies have been improvingacross the industry and are expected to improve among all processes. 7.7 Summary Each AM process has its advantages and disadvantages. The primary advantages ofprinting, both direct and binder printing, as an AM process include low cost, highspeed, scalability, ease of building parts in multiple materials, and the capability ofprinting colors. Printing machines are lower in cost than many other AM machines,particularly the ones that use lasers or electron beams. In general, printing machinescan be assembled from standard components (drives, stages, print heads), while198 7 Material Jettingother machines have many more machine-speciﬁc components. Two primary mechanisms exist for droplet generation, continuous mode and DOD. At present,all commercial MJ machines utilize DOD print heads. High speed and scalability are related: by using print heads with hundreds or thousands of nozzles, it is possible to deposit a lot of material quickly and over a considerable area. Scalabilityin this context means that printing speed can be increased by adding another printhead to a machine, a relatively easy task, much easier than adding another laser to avat photopolymerization or powder bed fusion machine. 7.8 Exercises List ﬁve types of material that can be directly printed.2.

They developed what they called the 3D Printing (3DP) process in which abinder is printed onto a powder bed to form part cross sections. This concept canbe contrasted with powder bed fusion (PBF), where a laser melts powderparticles to deﬁne a part cross section. A wide range of polymer composite, metals, and ceramic materials have been demonstrated, but only a subset of these are commercially available. Some binder jetting machines contain nozzles thatprint color, not binder, enabling the fabrication of parts with many colors.Several companies licensed the 3DP technology from MIT and became success-ful machine developers, including ExOne and ZCorp (purchased by 3D Systemsin 2011). A novel continuous printing technology was been developed recentlyby Voxeljet that can, in principle, fabricate parts of unlimited length. 8.1 Introduction The original name for binder jetting was Three-Dimensional Printing (3DP) and itwas invented at MIT and has been licensed to more than ﬁve companies forcommercialization. In contrast to the printing processes described in Chap. 7, binder jetting (BJ) processes print a binder into a powder bed to fabricate a part. Hence, in BJ, only a small portion of the part material is delivered through the printhead. Most of the part material is comprised of powder in the powder bed.Typically, binder droplets (80 μm in diameter) form spherical agglomerates of binder liquid and powder particles as well as provide bonding to the previouslyprinted layer. Once a layer is printed, the powder bed is lowered and a new layer ofpowder is spread onto it (typically via a counter-rotating rolling mechanism) [ 1], very similar to the recoating methods used in powder bed fusion processes, as presented in Chap. 5. This process (printing binder into bed; recoating bed with new #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_8205layer of powder) is repeated until the part, or array of parts, is completed. A schematic of the BJ process is shown in Fig. 8.1. Because the printer head contains several ejection nozzles, BJ features several parallel one-dimensional avenues for patterning. Since the process can be econom-ically scaled by simply increasing the number of printer nozzles, the process isconsidered a scalable, line-wise patterning process. Such embodiments typicallyhave a high deposition speed at a relatively low cost (due to the lack of a high-powered energy source) [ 1], which is the case for BJ machines. The printed part is typically left in the powder bed after its completion in order for the binder to fully set and for the green part to gain strength. Post-processinginvolves removing the part from the powder bed, removing unbound powder viapressurized air, and inﬁltrating the part with an inﬁltrant to make it stronger andpossibly to impart other mechanical properties. The BJ process shares many of the same advantages of powder bed processes. Parts are self-supporting in the powder bed so that support structures are notneeded. Similar to other processes, parts can be arrayed in one layer and stacked in the powder bed to greatly increase the number of parts that can be built at one time. Finally, assemblies of parts and kinematic joints can be fabricated since loosepowder can be removed between the parts. Applications of BJ processes are highly dependent upon the material being processed. Low-cost BJ machines use a plaster-based powder and a water-basedbinder to fabricate parts. Polymer powders are also available. Some machines havecolor print heads and can print visually attractive parts. With this capability, amarket has developed for colorful ﬁgures from various computer games, as well as personal busts or sculptures, with images taken from cameras. Inﬁltrants are used to strengthen the parts after they are removed from the powder bed. With eitherthe starch or polymer powders, parts are typically considered visual prototypes or X-Y positioning system PartPowder spreaderInkjet print head Unused powde r Build platformZBinder droplets Fig. 8.1 Schematic of the binder jetting process206 8 Binder Jettinglight-duty functional prototypes. In some cases, particularly with elastomeric inﬁltrants, parts can be used for functional purposes. With polymer powders andwax-based inﬁltrants, parts can be used as patterns for investment casting, since the powder and wax can burn off easily. For metal powders, parts can be used as functional prototypes or for production purposes, provided that the parts have been designed speciﬁcally for the metalalloys available. Molds and cores for sand casting can be fabricated by some BJmachines that use silica or foundry sand as the powder. This is a sizable applicationin the automotive and heavy equipment industries. 8.2 Materials 8.2.1 Commercially Available Materials When Z Corporation ﬁrst started in the mid-1990s, their ﬁrst material was starchbased and used a water-based binder similar to a standard house-hold glue. Atpresent, the commercially available powder from 3D Systems is plaster based(calcium sulfate hemihydrate) and the binder is water based [ 2]. Printed parts are fairly weak, so they are typically inﬁltrated with another material. 3D Systemsprovides three inﬁltrants, the ColorBond inﬁltrant, which is acrylate-based and issimilar to superglue, StrengthMax inﬁltrant which is a two-part inﬁltrant, and SaltWater Cure, an eco-friendly and hazard-free inﬁltrant. Strength, stiffness, and elongation data are given on 3D Systems’ web site for parts fabricated with these inﬁltrants. In general, parts with any of the inﬁltrants are much stiffer than typicalthermoplastics or VP resins, but are less strong, and have very low elongation atbreak (0.04–0.23 %). Voxeljet [ 3], on the other hand, supplies a PMMA (poly-methyl methacrylate) powder and uses a liquid binder that reacts at room temperature. They recommendthat parts stay in the powder bed for several hours to ensure that the binder iscompletely cured. For investment casting pattern fabrication, they offer a wax-based binder for use with PMMA powder that is somewhat larger in particle size than the powder used for parts. They claim excellent pattern burnout forinvestment casting. For materials from both companies, unprinted powders are fully recyclable, meaning that they can be reused in subsequent builds. A desirable characteristicof powders is a high packing density so that printed parts have a high volumefraction of powder and are strong enough to survive depowdering and clean upoperations. High packing densities can be achieved by tailoring powder particle shape or by including a range of particle sizes so that small particles ﬁll in gaps between larger particles. In practice, both approaches are used whenever possible. Quite a few other inﬁltrant materials have been marketed by ZCorp and 3D Systems and many users have experimented with a variety of materials, soalternatives are possible that can produce parts with a wide range of mechanicalproperties.8.2 Materials 207ExOne markets machines that use either metal or sand powders for metal parts or sand-casting molds and cores, respectively [ 4]. In the metals area, they currently market 3,166 stainless steel and bronze, 420 stainless steel (non-annealed), 420 stainless steel (annealed), bronze, and Inconel 625. For the stainless steel materials, bronze is used as an inﬁltrant so that parts are virtually fully dense.Polymer binders are used for the metals. In order to fabricate a metal part, the“green” part is removed from the AM machine, then is subject to three furnacecycles. In the ﬁrst cycle, low temperature is used for several hours to burn off thepolymer binder. In the second cycle, high temperature is used to lightly sinter themetal particles together so that the part has decent strength. If this cycle is too long,the metal particles more completely melt, causing the part to lose dimensional accuracy and its desired shape. After this cycle, the part is approximately 60 % dense. In the ﬁnal cycle, a bronze ingot is placed in the furnace in contact with thepart so that bronze inﬁltrates into the part’s pores, resulting in parts that are 90–95 % dense. An exception to the light sintering and inﬁltration process is the new Inconel 625 material announced by ExOne in 2014. Although they use a binder, the Inconelmaterial can be sintered to virtually full density (ExOne claims greater than 99 %dense) while maintaining acceptable dimensional accuracy. If this process can be extended to other metals, it could change the economics of metal AM signiﬁcantly. Both ExOne and Voxeljet market machines that use sand for the fabrication of molds and cores for sand casting. ExOne offers a silica sand and two-part binder,where one part (binder catalyst) is coated on a layer and the second part is printedonto the layer, causing a polymerization reaction to occur and binding sandparticles together. They claim that only standard foundry materials are used sothat resulting molds and cores enable easy integration into existing manufacturingand foundry processes. Voxeljet also offers a silica sand with an inorganic binder and claims that their materials also integrate well into existing foundry processes. Finally, ExOne markets a soda-lime glass material for use in fabricating artwork, jewelry, or other decorative objects. Different colors and ﬁnishes are available. Anorganic binder is used that requires an elevated temperature curing cycle. Then,parts need to be ﬁred at high temperature to sinter the glass particles and impartdecent strength and stiffness. 8.2.2 Ceramic Materials in Research A wide range of materials has been developed for BJ by researchers. Printing intometal and ceramic powder beds was ﬁrst demonstrated in the early 1990s. Various powder mixes, including compositions and size distributions, have been explored. Traditional powder-based BJ of ceramics involves the selective printing of a binder over a bed of ceramic powder [ 5]. Fabrication of ceramic parts follows a very similar process compared with metal parts. Green parts created by this processare subjected to a thermal decomposition prior to sintering to remove the polymerbinder. After binder burn off, the furnace temperature is increased until the208 8 Binder Jettingceramic’s sintering temperature is reached. Sometimes an inﬁltrant is used that reacts to form a ceramic binder. Another possibility is to inﬁltrate with a metal toform a ceramic-metal composite. The ﬁrst report of using BJ for the fabrication of ceramics was in 1993; ﬁred components were reported as typically greater than 99.2 % dense [ 5]. Alumina, silica, and titanium dioxide have been made with this process [ 6]. Research involving the BJ of ceramics encountered early setbacks because of the use of dry powders. The ﬁne powders needed for good powder bed density did notgenerally ﬂow well enough to spread into defect-free layers [ 5]. Furthermore, since green part density was inadequate with the use of dry powders, isostatic pressingwas implemented after the printing process. This extraneous requirement severely limits the types of part shapes capable of being processed. To counteract the problems encountered with recoating a dry powder bed, research on ceramic BJ has shifted to the use of a slurry-based working material.In this approach, layers are ﬁrst deposited by ink-jet printing a layer of slurry overthe build area. After the slurry dries, binder is selectively printed to deﬁne the partshape. This is repeated for each individual layer, at the cost of signiﬁcantlyincreased build time. Multiple jets containing different material composition orconcentration could be employed to prepare components with composition and density variation on a ﬁne scale (100 μm) [7]. Alumina and silicon nitride have been processed with this technique, improving green part density to 67 %, and utilizinglayer thicknesses as small as 10 μm[8]. Recently, a variation of this method was developed to fabricate metal parts starting with metal-oxide powders [ 9]. The ceramic BJ is used until the furnace sintering step. While in the furnace, a hydrogen atmosphere is introduced, causing areduction reaction to occur between the hydrogen and the oxygen atoms in themetal-oxide. The reduction reaction converts the oxide to metal. After reduction, the metal particles are sintered to form a metal part. This process has been demonstrated for several material systems, including iron, steels, and copper.Unfortunately, reaction thermodynamics prevent alumina and titanium oxidefrom being reduced to aluminum and titanium, respectively. This Metal-Oxide Reduction 3DP (MO3DP) process was demonstrated using a Z405 machine [ 10]. Metal-oxide powders containing iron oxide, chromium oxide, and a small amount of molybdenum were prepared by spray drying the powdercomposition with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form clusters of powder particles coated with PVA. Upon reduction, the material composition formed a maraging steel. Water was selectively printed into the powder bed to deﬁne part crosssections, since the water will dissolve PVA, causing the clusters to stick together.A variety of shapes (trusses, channels, thin walls) were fabricated using the processto demonstrate the feasibility of producing cellular materials. The main advantage of BJ, in the context of manufacturing cellular materials, lies in its economic considerations. Simply put, the BJ process does not require highenergy, does not involve lasers or any toxic materials, and is relatively inexpensive and fast. Part creation rate is limited to approximately twice the binder ﬂow rate. A typical inkjet nozzle delivers approximately 1 cm 3/min of binder; thus a machine8.2 Materials 209with a 100 nozzle print head could create up to approximately 200 cm3/min of printed component. Because commercial inkjet printers exist with up to 1,600nozzles, BJ could be fast enough to be used as a production process. 8.3 Process Variations Almost all commercially available BJ machines use the architecture shown inFig.8.1. An array of print heads is mounted on an XY translation mechanism. If the process is capable of printing colored parts, some print heads are dedicated toprinting binder material, while others are dedicated to printing color. Typically, the print heads used are standard, off-the-shelf print heads that are found in machines for 2D printing of posters, banners, and similar applications. Parts are fabricated inbatches, just like every other AM process. Powder handling and recoating systems are similar to those used in powder bed fusion processes. Differences arise when comparing low-cost visual model printers(for plaster or polymer powders) to the metal or sand printers. For the low-costprinters, powder containers (vats) can be hand-carried. In the latter cases, however,powder beds can weigh hundreds or thousands of pounds, necessitating different material handling and powder bed manipulation methods. For the sand printers, the vats utilize a rail system for conveying powder beds to and from depowderingstations and cranes are used for transporting parts or molds. The capability of continuous printing or of fabricating parts that are larger than the AM machine fabricating them has been discussed in the research community. Inrecent years, two different approaches have been demonstrated for continuousprinting of parts. One approach is being commercialized by Voxeljet in 2013 andis based on linear translation of the part being fabricated. The second approach is called spiral growth manufacturing and was developed by researchers at the University of Liverpool, UK. The Voxeljet continuous printing process is a novel idea that utilizes an inclined build plane. That is, the build surface of the powder bed is inclined at an angle of30 /C14, less than the powder’s critical angle of repose. Powder recoating and binder jetting are performed on this inclined build surface. The powder bed translates on aconveyor belt from the front towards the back of the machine. In contrast to typicalbatch fabrication, parts emerge continuously at the back of the machine. In princi- ple, parts could be inﬁnitely long, certainly much longer than the machine. The continuous part fabrication capability could represent an important step in achiev-ing economical manufacture of moderate to high production volumes of parts. The second continuous fabrication approach, spiral growth manufacturing (SGM) was invented by Chris Sutcliffe at the University of Liverpool in the early2000s. The patent US2008109102 is a good reference for further information[11]. In the BJ variant of SGM, the powder bed is circular and rotates continuously. Binder printing and recoating are performed continuously also. As the machine operates, the powder bed indexes downwards continuously to accommodate the210 8 Binder Jettingnext layer of powder. As such, the top layer of powder forms a spiral in the powder bed. A machine schematic from the patent is shown in Fig. 8.2. In the ﬁgure, object 2 is the cylindrical build chamber. Plates 10, 8, 14, and 23 do not rotate; plate 14 supports the build chamber and slides up and down on the pillars The build chamber rotates, driven by the lead screw numbered 6. Four powdersupply hoppers are shown by objects 24, so this indicates that the machine has fourbuild stations, each with print heads and recoater mechanism. As a consequence, foreach rotation of the build chamber, effectively four layers are deposited andprocessed. So, for example, if the layer thickness is 0.1 mm, each rotation of thebuild chamber adds 0.4 mm to the powder bed height and plate 14 and the buildchamber must translate downward by 0.4 mm to accommodate this increase in bed height. Each build station typically contains a print head with multiple nozzles. Since the width of the powder bed is typically greater than the print head width, a linearstage must be used to translate the print head across the powder bed. The linearvelocity of the outer edge of the build chamber is greater than the linear velocity atthe inner edge, which means that the powder along the outer edge passes the printhead at a faster speed. This has important consequences for the printing conditionsacross the width of the chamber: more binder has to be deposited per unit time along the outer edge compared to the inner edge. Effectively this means that the images being printed have to be pre-skewed in order to compensate for the differences inspeed. As an example, Fig. 8.3shows how an image must be skewed so that the Fig. 8.2 Schematic of a spiral growth manufacturing BJ machine8.3 Process Variations 211printed image is fabricated properly [ 12]. This image was printed on a SGM machine with two print heads, hence the two images on the right. Note that the inner edge is on the left side of the image, which is stretched, while the outer edge is compressed. 8.4 BJ Machines A wide variety of powder and binder materials can be used which enables signiﬁ- cant ﬂexibility in the process. MIT licensed the BJ technology according to the type of material and application that each licensee was allowed to exploit. ZCorp, Inc. was one company that marketed machines that build concept models in starch and plaster powder using a low viscosity glue as binder. At the other end of the spectrum, ExOne markets machines that build in metal powder, with a strong polymer material that is used as the binder, as well as silica sand for sand casting applications. Voxeljet is a relatively new company that markets BJ machines that use polymer and sand powders for concept models, functional models, investment casting patterns, and sand casting applications. As of 2012, ZCorp was purchased by 3D Systems and their product line was merged into 3D Systems’ ProJet line of printers. These printers are now branded as the ProJet X60 line of printers, with the smallest being the ProJet 160 and the largest being the ProJet 860Pro. Speciﬁcations for some of these machines are shown in Table 8.1. Machine names consisting only of numbers fabricate parts that are monochrome only, while sufﬁxes of C, Plus, or Pro indicate that parts can be printed in color, up to the full CMYK color model (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key (black)). Voxeljet sold their ﬁrst machine in 2005. They now offer a range of machines from the smallest VX200 to the huge VX4000, which has a 4 m long powder bed. The VX4000 processes foundry sand materials for the sand casting industry. They also market the VXC800, which is the inﬁnitely continuous printer that was Fig. 8.3 Skewing an image for SGM printing212 8 Binder JettingTable 8.1 Machine specifications for binder printing machines Company/ modelsCost (1,000s)Deposition rate (mm/h)Build size ( l/C2w/C2h) (mm)Resolution (dpi)Layer thickness (mm)Number of nozzles Materials 3D Systems ProJet 160 $16.50 20 236 /C2185/C2127 300 /C2450 0.1 304 Polymer composite with inﬁltrants ProJet 260C $28.70 20 236 /C2185/C2127 300 /C2450 0.1 604 ProJet 860 Pro$114 15 May 508 /C2381/C2229 600 /C2540 0.1 1,520 ExOne Lab Platform$125 6 March 40 /C260/C235 400 /C2400 0.05–0.1 Stainless steel, bronze, ceramics, glass Flex Platform$425 12 400 /C2250/C2250 400 /C2400 0.1 Above and Inconel Max Platform>$1,400 20 1,800 /C21,000/C2700 300 /C2300 0.28–0.5 Silica sand, ceramics Voxeljet VX200 $159 12 300 /C2200/C2150 300 /C2300 0.15 256 PMMA, inorganic sand VXC800 $700 35 850 /C2500/C230/C14600/C2600 0.15–0.4 2,656 VX4000 $1,850 15.4 4,000 /C22,000/C21,000 600 /C2600 0.12–0.3 26,5608.4 BJ Machines 213described earlier. A photo of the VXC800 is shown in Fig. 8.4. For this machine, the layer thickness is 150–400 μm and they use 600 dpi print heads. The surface area of the inclined plane is 500 /C2850 mm. The ExOne Corporation markets a line of BJ machines that fabricate metal parts and sand casting molds and cores in foundry sand. Strong polymer binders arerequired with these heavy powders. As explained earlier, nearly fully dense partscan be fabricated by printing binder into the metal bed, burning off the binder in afurnace at a low temperature, sintering the metal powder during a high temperaturefurnace cycle, then inﬁltrating a second metal, such as copper or bronze, at a lowtemperature. The printed part, when removed from the bed, is a relatively low-density (50–60 %) green part. Other than how the green part is formed, this process is identical to the indirect processing approach for metal and ceramic partfabrication discussed in Chap. 5and illustrated in Fig. 5.7. Stainless steel-bronze parts have been made with this technology [ 4]. The process is typically accurate to /C60.125 mm. Several ExOne machine models are also listed in Table 8.1. Applications for the metal material models include prototypes of metal parts and some low-volume manufacturing, as well as tooling. As parts are fabricated in apowder bed, the surface ﬁnish of these parts is comparable to PBF parts. Finish machining is thus required for high tolerance and mating surfaces. ExOne markets another machine that fabricates gold dental restorations, for example, copings forcrowns. The materials and binder printing system were developed speciﬁcally forthis application, since higher resolution is needed. In the tooling area, ExOne promotes the advantages of conformal cooling in injection molds. In conformal cooling, cooling channels are routed close to thesurfaces of the part cavity, particularly where hot spots are predicted. Usingconventional machining processes, cooling channels are drilled as straight holes. With AM processes, however, cooling channels of virtually any shape and conﬁgu- ration can be designed into tools. Figure 8.5illustrates one tool design with conformal cooling channels that was fabricated in an ExOne machine. Fig. 8.4 Voxeljet VXC800 machine (Courtesy Voxeljet)214 8 Binder JettingThe largest machine, the S-Max, is intended for companies with large demands for castings, such as the automotive, heavy equipment, and oil & gas industries. A photo of the S-Max is shown in Fig. 8.6. Several dozen of these large machines (S-Max and its predecessor S15) have been installed. The machines print molds andcores for sand casting. Various metals can be cast into the printed molds, includingaluminum, zinc, and even magnesium. Special equipment was developed forhandling the large volumes of powders and heavy vats, including a silo and powderconveyor, conveyor track for transporting vats of powder and ﬁnished molds, and adebinding station. A typical installation with a S-Max or S15 machine occupies a room 40–50 m 2in size. Microjet Technology (Taiwan) is another company that currently markets BJ systems.

With respect to MJ, binder jetting has some distinctadvantages. First, it can be faster since only a small fraction of the total part volumemust be dispensed through the print heads. However, the need to distribute powderadds an extra step, slowing down binder processes somewhat. Second, the combi- nation of powder materials and additives in binders enables material compositions that are not possible, or not easily achieved, using direct methods. Third, slurrieswith higher solids loadings are possible with BJ, compared with MJ, enabling betterquality ceramic and metal parts to be produced. As mentioned earlier, BJ processeslend themselves readily to printing colors onto parts. As a general rule, however, parts fabricated using BJ processes tend to have poorer accuracies and surface ﬁnishes than parts made with MJ. Inﬁltration stepsare typically needed to fabricate dense parts or to ensure good mechanical properties. As with any set of manufacturing processes, the choice of manufacturing process and material depends largely on the requirements of the part or device. It is a matterof compromising on the best match between process capabilities and designrequirements.

LOM involved layer-by-layer lamination of paper material sheets, cut using a CO 2laser, each sheet representing one cross- sectional layer of the CAD model of the part. In LOM, the portion of the paper sheetwhich is not contained within the ﬁnal part is sliced into cubes of material using acrosshatch cutting operation. A schematic of the LOM process can be seen inFig.9.1. A number of other processes have been developed based on sheet lamination involving other build materials and cutting strategies. Because of the constructionprinciple, only the outer contours of the parts are cut, and the sheets can be either cut and then stacked or stacked and then cut. These processes can be further categorized based on the mechanism employed to achieve bonding between layers:(a) gluing or adhesive bonding, (b) thermal bonding, (c) clamping, and(d) ultrasonic welding. As the use of ultrasonic welding involves unique solidstate bonding characteristics and can enable a wide range of applications, anextended discussion of this bonding approach is included at the end of this chapter. 9.1.1 Gluing or Adhesive Bonding The most popular sheet lamination techniques have included a paper build material bonded using a polymer-based adhesive. Initially LOM was developed using adhesive-backed paper similar to the “butcher paper” used to wrap meat. Paperthicknesses range from 0.07 to 0.2 mm. Potentially any sheet material that can beprecisely cut using a laser or mechanical cutter and that can be bonded can beutilized for part construction. A further classiﬁcation is possible within these processes based upon the order in which they bond and cut the sheet. In some processes the laminate is bonded ﬁrst to #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_9219the substrate and is then formed into the cross-sectional shape (“bond-then-form” processes). For other processes the laminate is ﬁrst cut and then bonded to the substrate (“form-then-bond” processes). 9.1.2 Bond-Then-Form Processes In “bond-then-form” processes, the building process typically consists of three steps in the following sequence: placing the laminate, bonding it to the substrate, and cutting it according to the slice contour. The original LOM machines used this process with adhesive-backed rolls of material. A heated roller passes across the sheet after placing it for each layer, melting the adhesive and producing a bond between layers. A laser (or in some cases a mechanical cutting knife) designed to cut to a depth of one layer thickness cuts the cross-sectional outline based on the slice information. The unused material is left in place as support material and is diced using a crosshatch pattern into small rectangular pieces called “tiles” or “cubes.” This process of bonding and cutting is repeated until the complete part is built. After part construction, the part block is taken out and post-processed. The crosshatched pieces of excess material are separated from the part using typical wood carving tools (called decubing). It is relatively difﬁcult to remove the part from the part block when it is cold, therefore, it is often put into an oven for some time before decubing or the part block is processed immediately after part buildup. Although historically many people continue to associate paper sheet lamination with the LOM machines introduced in 1991 by Helisys Inc., USA and subsequently supported by Cubic Technologies, USA (after Helisys’ bankruptcy), new paper- based sheet lamination machines are currently sold by Mcor Technologies (Ireland) Fig. 9.1 Schematic of the LOM process (based on [ 1] Journal of Materials Processing Technol- ogy by D.I. Wimpenny, B. Bryden, I.R. Pashby. Copyright 2003 by Elsevier Science & Technol- ogy Journals. Reproduced with permission of Elsevier Science & Technology Journals in the format Textbook via Copyright Clearance Center.)220 9 Sheet Lamination Processesand Wuhan Binhu (China). These new systems make use of plain paper as the build material, and selectively dispense adhesive only where needed. Because the supportmaterial is not adhesively bonded, unlike in LOM, the support removal process iseasier. The use of color inkjet printing onto paper by Mcor Technologies enables the production of full-color paper parts directly from a CAD ﬁle. Solidimension (Be’erot, Israel) took the concepts of LOM and further developed them in 1999 into a commercial prototyping system for laminating polyvinylchloride (PVC) plastic sheets. Solidimension sold its own machines under theSolido name [ 2] and under other names via resellers. This machine utilized an x– yplotter for cutting the PVC sheets and for writing with “anti glue” pens, which inhibit bonding in prescribed locations. This machine used a unique approach tosupport material removal. Support material was subdivided into regions, and unique patterns for cutting and bonding the excess material were used to enable easy support material removal. An example of this support material strategy can beseen in Fig. 9.2. Solido machines are no longer offered for sale, however if history is any guide, others may pick up this unique idea and offer similar machines someday. Bond-then-form sheet lamination principles have also been successfully applied to fabrication of parts from metal, ceramic, and composite materials. In this case,rather than paper or polymer sheets, ceramic or metal-ﬁlled tapes are used as thebuild material to form green parts, and high-temperature furnace post-processing is used to debind and sinter the structure. These tapes are then used for part construc- tion employing a standard sheet lamination process. Speciﬁc advantages of LOM-like bond-then-form adhesive-based processes include: (a) little shrinkage, residual stresses, and distortion problems within theprocess; (b) when using paper feedstock, the end material is similar to plywood, atypical pattern making material amenable to common ﬁnishing operations; (c) largeparts can be fabricated rapidly; (d) a variety of build materials can be used,including paper and polymer sheets and metal- or ceramic-ﬁlled tapes; (e) nontoxic, stable, and easy-to-handle feedstock; and (f) low material, machine, and process costs relative to other AM systems. Fig. 9.2 Support material removal for three golf balls made using a Solidimension machine, showing: ( a) the balls still encased in a central region, being separated from the larger block of bonded material; ( b) the support material is glued in an accordion-like manner so that the excess material can be pulled out easily as a continuous piece; and ( c) the balls after complete removal of excess support material (Courtesy 3D Systems)9.1 Introduction 221Paper-based sheet lamination has several limitations, including: (a) most paper- based parts require coating to prevent moisture absorption and excessive wear; (b) the control of the parts’ accuracy in the Z-dimension is difﬁcult (due to swelling or inconsistent sheet material thickness); (c) mechanical and thermal properties of the parts are inhomogeneous due to the glue used in the laminated structure; and (d) small part feature detail is difﬁcult to maintain due to the manual decubing process. In general, parts produced by paper-based sheet lamination have been most successfully applied in industries where wooden patterns are often used, or in applications where most features are upward facing. Examples of good applications for paper sheet lamination include patterns for sand casting and 3D topographical maps—where each layer represents a particular elevation of the map. 9.1.3 Form-Then-Bond Processes In form-then-bond processes, sheet material is cut to shape ﬁrst and then bonded to the substrate. This approach is popular for construction of parts in metallic or ceramic materials that are thermally bonded (discussed in Sect. 9.3.1 ) but imple- mentation has primarily been at the research level. One example of a glue-based form-then-bond process is the “Offset Fabbing” system patented by Ennex Corp., USA. In this process, a suitable sheet material with an adhesive backing is placed on a carrier and is cut to the outline of the desired cross section using a two-dimensional plotting knife. Parting lines and outlines of support structures are also cut. The shaped laminate is then placed on top of the previously deposited layers and bonded to it. This process continues until the part is complete. A schematic of the process is shown in Fig. 9.3. The form-then-bond approach facilitates construction of parts with internal features and channels. Internal features and small channels are difﬁcult or impossi- ble with a bond-then-form approach because the excess material is solid and thus material inside internal features cannot be removed once bonded (unless the part is Fig. 9.3 Offset Fabbing system, Ennex Corp ( http:// www.ennex.com/fab/Offset/ )222 9 Sheet Lamination Processescut open). Another advantage of form-then-bond approaches is that there is no danger of cutting into the previous layers, unlike in bond-then-form processes where cutting occurs after placing the layer on the previous layer; thus, laser power control or knife pressure is less demanding. Also, the time-consuming andpotentially damage-causing decubing step is eliminated. However, these processesrequire external supports for building overhanging features; some type of tooling oralignment system to ensure a newly bonded layer is registered properly with respectto the previous layers; or a ﬂexible material carrier that can accurately placematerial regardless of geometry. Computer-Aided Manufacturing of Laminated Engineering Materials (CAM-LEM, Inc., USA) was developed as a process for fabrication of functional ceramic parts using a form-then-bond method, as shown in Fig. 9.4. In this process, individual slices are laser cut from sheet stock of green ceramic or metal tape. Theseslices are precisely stacked one over another to create the part. After assembly thelayers are bonded using heat and pressure or another adhesive method to ensureintimate contact between layers. The green part is then furnace processed in amanner identical to indirect processing of metal or ceramic green parts made usingpowder bed fusion, as introduced in Chap. 5. The CL-100 machine produced parts from up to ﬁve types of materials, including materials of differing thickness, which were automatically incorporated into a build. One or more of these materials mayact as secondary support materials to enable internal voids or channels andoverhangs. These support materials were later removed using thermal or chemicalmeans. A key application for this technology is for the fabrication of microﬂuidicstructures (structures with microscale internal cavities and channels). An examplemicroﬂuidic structure made using CAM-LEM is shown in Fig. 9.5. Fig. 9.4 CAM-LEM process (Courtesy CAM-LEM, Inc.)9.1 Introduction 223Another example of a form then bond process is the Stratoconception approach [3], where the model is sliced into thicker layers. These layers are machined and then glued together to form a part. The use of a multiaxis machining center enablesthe edges of each layer to be contoured to better match the STL ﬁle, helpingeliminate the stair-step effect that occurs with increasing layer thickness. Thisand similar cutting techniques have been used by many different researchers tobuild large structures from foam, wood, and other materials to form statues, largeworks of art, and other structures. 9.2 Materials As covered in the previous section, a wide variety of materials has been processedusing a variety of sheet lamination processes, including plastics, metals, ceramics, and paper. A brief survey will be offered identifying the materials and their characteristics that facilitate sheet lamination. Butcher paper was the ﬁrst material used in the original Helisys LOM process. Butcher paper is coated on one side with a thin layer of a thermoplastic polymer. Itis this polymer coating that melts and ensures that one layer of paper bonds to theprevious layer. Since butcher paper is fairly strong and heavy, it forms sturdy partsafter a suitable thickness has been fabricated ( >5–6 mm typically). After part fabrication, parts are ﬁnished as if they were wood by sanding, ﬁling, staining, and varnishing or sealing. The recently developed Mcor Technologies printers use standard copy paper in A4 or US letter sizes with weights of 20 or 43 lb. Either white or colored paper canbe used. The water-based glue binds paper sheets and results in fairly rigid partsalthough, similar to the Helisys process, a minimum thickness of 5 or 6 mm isrequired to ensure good strength. Fig. 9.5 A ceramic microﬂuidic distillation device cutaway view ( left) and ﬁnished part ( right) (Courtesy CAM-LEM, Inc.)224 9 Sheet Lamination ProcessesIn the metals area, both bond-then-form and form-then-bond approaches have been pursued. Perhaps the most conceptually simple fabrication process is the sheetmetal clamping approach, where sheet metal is cut to form part cross sections, then simply clamped together. Other processes use several types of bonding methods. Some researchers were interested in demonstrating the feasibility of some metalsheet lamination process advances, rather than fabricating functional devices, andsimply used an adhesive to bond sheets together. In other cases, the adhesivebonded structures were meant to be functional prototypes, not just proof-of-concepts. Aluminum and low-carbon steel materials were most commonly used,unless functional molds or dies were desired, in which case tool steels were used.Thermal and diffusion bonding approaches, on the other hand, tend to provide much more strong parts. Thermal bonding, to be discussed in the next section, has been demonstrated with a variety of aluminum and steel sheets and several types ofbonding mechanisms, including brazing and welding. Diffusion bonding, to becovered in Sect. 9.4, has also been demonstrated on a variety of metals and is the important joining mechanism for ultrasonic consolidation, where aluminum, tita-nium, stainless steel, brass, Inconel, and copper materials have been demonstrated. In sheet lamination processes, ceramic materials are most often fabricated using bond-them-form processes using ceramic-ﬁlled tapes. Tape casting methods form sheets of material composed of powdered ceramics, such as SiC, TiC-Ni composite, or alumina, and a polymer binder. Metal powder tapes can also be used to fabricatemetal parts. These tapes are then used for part construction employing a standardsheet lamination process. Various SiC, alumina, TiC-Ni composite, and othermaterial tapes have been used to build parts. A challenge with this process is thatthermal post-processing to consolidate metal or ceramic powders results in a largeamount of shrinkage (12–18 %) which can lead to dimensional inaccuracies anddistortion. This is typical of many conventional powder-based processes, such as powder injection molding, and strategies have been developed to address the effects of shrinkage, although limitations exist. For polymer materials, the Solidimension example is the most well known and used PVC sheets. Foam blocks have also been used in some research machines, aswell as by sculptors who create large sculptures by stacking blocks cut by hot wireor CNC milling. Additionally, some research efforts have successfullydemonstrated the automated lay-up of polymer composite sheets. The area ofpolymer sheet lamination is broad and not very well deﬁned, since it stretches from sculpture to composites manufacturing. This is, perhaps, an area that will see signiﬁcant attention in the near-term due to its potential. 9.3 Material Processing Fundamentals As indicated, several types of processes are evident under the general category ofsheet lamination. Thermal bonding and sheet metal clamping are covered in thissection. In the next section, a more in-depth coverage is provided for the ultrasonicconsolidation process.9.3 Material Processing Fundamentals 2259.3.1 Thermal Bonding Many organizations around the world have successfully applied thermal bonding to sheet lamination of functional metal parts and tooling. A few examples will be mentioned to demonstrate the ﬂexibility of this approach. Yi et al. [ 4] have successfully fabricated 3D metallic parts using precut 1-mm thick steel sheetsthat are then diffusion bonded. They demonstrated continuity in grain structureacross sheet interfaces without any physical discontinuities. Himmer et al. [ 5] produced aluminum injection molding dies with intricate cooling channels usingAl 3003 sheets coated with 0.1-mm thick low-melting point Al 4343 (total sheetthickness 2.5 mm). The sheets were laser cut to an approximate, oversized crosssection, assembled using mechanical fasteners, bonded together by heating the assembly in a nitrogen atmosphere just above the melting point of the Al 4343 coating material, and then ﬁnish machined to the prescribed part dimensions andsurface ﬁnish. Himmer et al. [ 6] also demonstrated satisfactory layer bonding using brazing and laser spot welding processes. Obikawa [ 7] manufactured metal parts employing a similar process from thinner steel sheets (0.2 mm thick), with their topand bottom surface coated with a low-melting-point alloy. Wimpenny et al. [ 1] produced laminated steel tooling with conformal cooling channels by brazing laser-cut steel sheets. Similarly, Yamasaki [ 8] manufactured dies for automobile body manufacturing using 0.5-mm thick steel sheets. Each of these, and other investigators, have shown that thermally bonding metal sheets is an effectivemethod for forming complex metal parts and tools, particularly those which haveinternal cavities and/or cooling channels. Although extensively studied, sheet metal lamination approaches have gained little traction commercially. This is primarily due to the fact that bond-then-formprocesses require extensive post-processing to remove support materials, and form-then-bond processes are difﬁcult to automate for arbitrary, complex geometries. In the case of form-then-bond processes, particularly if a cross section has geometry that is disconnected from the remaining geometry, accurate registration oflaminates is difﬁcult to achieve and may require a part-speciﬁc solution. Thus,upward-facing features where each cross section’s geometry is contiguouslyinterconnected are the easiest to handle. Commercial interest in sheet laminationis primarily in the area of inexpensive, full-color paper parts and large tooling,where internal, conformal cooling channels can provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts overtraditional cooling strategies. Another process that combined sheet lamination with other forms of AM (including beam deposition, extrusion, and subtractive machining) was ShapeDeposition Manufacturing (SDM) [ 9]. With SDM, the geometry of the part is subdivided into nonplanar segments. Each segment is deposited as an over-sized,near-net shape region and then ﬁnish machined. Sequential deposition and machin-ing of segments (rather than planar layers) forms the part. A decision is madeconcerning how each segment should be manufactured dependent on such factors asthe accuracy, material, geometrical features, and functional requirements. Second- ary support materials were commonly used to enable complex geometry to be made226 9 Sheet Lamination Processesand for clearance between mechanisms that required differential motion after manufacture. A completely automated subdivision routine for arbitrary geometries, however, was never developed and intervention from a human “expert” is required for many types of geometries. As a result, though interesting and useful for certain complex multimaterial structures, such a system was never commercially introduced. 9.3.2 Sheet Metal Clamping In the case of assembling rigid metal laminates into simple shapes, it may be advantageous to simply clamp the sheets together using bolts and/or a clamping mechanism rather than using an adhesive or thermal bonding method. Clamping is quick and inexpensive and enables the laminates to be disassembled in order to modify a particular laminate’s cross section and/or for easy recycling of the materials. In addition, the clamping or bolting mechanism can act as a reference point to register each laminate with respect to one another. When clamping, it is often advantageous to simply cut a proﬁle into one edge of a laminate, leaving three edges of the rectangular sheet uncut. An example of such a “proﬁled edge laminate” construction is shown in Fig. 9.6. Of course, this type of proﬁled edge can also be utilized with adhesive and thermally bonded layers as well. The major beneﬁt of this approach is the ease with which the layers can be clamped (i.e., bolting the laminates together through a set of holes, as could be done using the through-holes visible on the right edge of Fig. 9.6). The drawbacks of a proﬁle approach are that clamping forces for most tools would then be perpendicu- lar to the laminate interface, and the laminates might separate from one another (leaving gaps) under certain conditions, such as when pressurized polymers are injected into a mold made from such a tool. Fig. 9.6 Proﬁled edge laminate tool (Courtesy Fraunhofer CCL)9.3 Material Processing Fundamentals 2279.4 Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM), also known as Ultrasonic Consolida- tion (UC), is a hybrid sheet lamination process combining ultrasonic metal seamwelding and CNC milling, and commercialized by Solidica Inc., USA in 2000, and subsequently licensed to Fabrisonics (USA). In UAM, the object is built up on a rigidly held base plate bolted onto a heated platen, with temperatures ranging fromroom temperature to approximately 200 /C14C. Parts are built from bottom to top, and each layer is composed of several metal foils laid side by side and then trimmedusing CNC milling. During UAM, a rotating sonotrode travels along the length of a thin metal foil (typically 100–150 μm thick). The foil is held closely in contact with the base plate or previous layer by applying a normal force via the rotating sonotrode, as shown schematically in Fig. 9.7. The sonotrode oscillates transversely to the direction of motion, at a constant 20 kHz frequency and user-set oscillation amplitude. Afterdepositing a foil, another foil is deposited adjacent to it. This procedure is repeateduntil a complete layer is placed. The next layer is bonded to the previouslydeposited layer using the same procedure. Typically four layers of depositedmetal foils are termed one level in UAM. After deposition of one level, the CNCmilling head shapes the deposited foils/layers to their slice contour (the contourdoes not need to be vertical, but can be a curved or angled surface, based on the local part geometry). This additive-subtractive process continues until the ﬁnal geometry of the part is achieved. Thus, UAM is a bond-then-form process, wherethe forming can occur after each layer or after a number of layers, depending on thesettings chosen by the user. Additionally, each layer is typically deposited as a Rotating Sonotrode Direction of Travel Heated Base Sonotrode Base plateNewly deposited foil Previously deposited foilFeb by automated foil feederForce applied by sonotrode Ultrasonic interfacial vibration Friction at interface breaks up oxides Held stationary by base plateInterfacial strain energy leads to plastic deformation and intimate contactMetallurgical bond formed 20 µm Fig. 9.7 Schematic of ultrasonic consolidation228 9 Sheet Lamination Processescombination of foils laid side by side rather than a single large sheet, as is typically practiced in sheet lamination processes. By the introduction of CNC machining, the dimensional accuracy and surface ﬁnish of UAM end products is not dependent on the foil thickness, but on the CNC milling approach that is used. This eliminates the stair-stepping effects and layer-thickness-dependent accuracy aspects of other AM processes. Due to the combina-tion of low-temperature ultrasonic bonding, and additive-plus-subtractiveprocessing, the UAM process is capable of creating complex, multifunctional 3Dparts, including objects with complex internal features, objects made up of multiplematerials, and objects integrated with wiring, ﬁber optics, sensors, and instruments.The lack of an automated support material in commercial systems, however, means that many types of complex overhanging geometries cannot be built using UAM. However, on-going support material research for UAM will hopefully result in anautomated support material approach in the future. To better illustrate the UAM process, Fig. 9.8a–f illustrates the steps utilized to fabricate a honeycomb panel (270 mm by 240 mm by 10 mm). The cutaway CADmodel showing the internal honeycomb features is shown in Fig. 9.8a. The part is fabricated on a 350 mm by 350 mm by 13 mm Al 3003 base plate, which is ﬁrmlybolted to a heated platen, as shown in Fig. 9.8b. Metal foils used for this part are Al 3003 foils 25 mm wide and 0.15 mm thick. The ﬁrst layer of deposited foils is shown in Fig. 9.8c. Since the width of one layer is much larger than the width of the individual metal foils, multiple foils are deposited side by side for one layer. Afterthe deposition of the ﬁrst layer, a second layer is deposited on the ﬁrst layer and soon, as seen in Fig. 9.8d. After every four layers of deposition, the UAM machine trims the excess tape ends, and machines internal and external features based on theCAD geometry. After every 40 layers, the machine does a surface machining passat the exact height of that layer (in this case the z-height of the 40th layer is 0.15 mm per layer times 40 layers, or 6 mm) to compensate for any excess z-height that may occur due to variability in foil thicknesses. A surface machining pass can occur atany point in the process if, for instance, a build interruption or failure occurs(enabling the build to be continued from any user-speciﬁc z-height). After a series of repetitive bonding and machining operations the facesheet layers are deposited toenclose the internal features, as shown Fig. 9.8e. Four layers are deposited, and the ﬁnal panel is shown in Fig. 9.8f. 9.4.1 UAM Bond Quality There are two widely accepted quality parameters for evaluating UAM-made structures, which are linear welding density (LWD) and part strength. LWD isdeﬁned as the percentage of interface which is bonded divided by the total length ofthe interface between two ultrasonically consolidated foils, determined metallo- graphically. An example of a microstructure sample made from four layers of Al 3003 tapes by UAM is shown in Fig. 9.9. The black areas represent the unbonded9.4 Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing 229regions along the interfaces. In this microstructure, a LWD of 100 % occurred only between Layer 1 and the base plate. 9.4.2 Ultrasonic Metal Welding Process Fundamentals Ultrasonic metal welding (UMW) is a versatile joining technology for variousindustries, including in electronics, automotive and aerospace. Compared to othermetal fusion processes, UMWs solid-state joining approach does not require high Fig. 9.8 Fabrication procedure for a honeycomb structure using UAM230 9 Sheet Lamination Processestemperature diffusion or metal melting; and the maximum processing temperature is generally no higher than 50 % of the melting point of the joined metals. Therefore, thermal residual stresses and thermally induced deformation due to resolidiﬁcation of molten metals, which are important considerations in thermal welding processes and many AM processes (such as powder bed fusion, beam deposition, and thermal bonding-based sheet lamination processes) are not a major consideration in UAM. Bonding in UMW can be by (a) mechanical interlocking; (b) melting of interface materials; (c) diffusion bonding; and (d) atomic forces across nascent metal surfaces (e.g., solid-state metallurgical bonding). In UAM, bonding of foils to one another appears to be almost exclusively by nascent metal forces (metallurgical bonding), whereas bonding between foils and embedded structures, such as rein- forcement ﬁbers, is primarily by mechanical interlocking. An example of a stainless steel 304 wire mesh embedded between Al 3003 foils using the UAM process is shown as Fig. 9.10. This ﬁgure illustrates that the mesh is mechanically interlocked with the Al 3003 matrix, whereas the SS mesh metallurgically bonded to itself and the Al 3003 layers metallurgically bonded to each other. Mechanical interlocking between the Al and SS mesh was due to plastic deformation of Al around and through the mesh. Thus, mechanical interlocking can take place for material combinations between dissimilar metals, or between materials with signiﬁcant hardness differences. For material combinations of similar materials or materials with similar hardness values, metallurgical bonding appears to be the dominant bond formation mechanism. Two conditions must be fulﬁlled for establishment of solid-state bonding during UAM: (a) generation of atomically clean metal surfaces and (b) intimate contact between clean metal surfaces. As all engineering metals contain surface oxides, the oxides must be displaced in order to achieve atomically clean metal surfaces in intimate contact. The ease with which oxide layers can be displaced depends on the Fig. 9.9 A UAM part made from four layers of Al 3003 foils. LWD is determined by calculating the bonded interface divided by the total interface ( arrows show the sonotrode traveling direction for each layer). “Effect of Process Parameters on Bond Formation during Ultrasonic Consolidation of Aluminum Alloy 3003,” G.D. Janaki Ram, Yanzhe Yang and Brent Stucker, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 25 (3), pp. 221–238, 20069.4 Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing 231ratio of metal-oxide hardness to base metal hardness, where higher ratios facilitate easier removal. Due to the signiﬁcant hardness differences between aluminum and aluminum oxide, Al 3003 alloys are one of the best-suited materials for ultrasonic welding. Nonstructural noble metals, such as gold which do not have surface oxide layers, are quite amenable to ultrasonic welding. Materials with difﬁcult-to-remove oxide layers are problematic for ultrasonic welding. However, difﬁcult-to-weld materials have been shown to be UAM compatible when employing chemical or mechanical techniques for removing the surface oxide layers just prior to welding. Plastic deformation at the foil interfaces is critical for UAM, to break up surface oxides and overcome surface roughness. The magnitude of plastic deformation necessary to achieve bonding can be reduced by decreasing the surface roughness of the interface materials prior to welding, such as by surface machining (which occurred between Layer 1 and the base plate in Fig. 9.9) and/or by removing the surface oxides by chemical stripping or surface ﬁnishing. In addition, factors which enhance plastic deformation are also beneﬁcial for bonding, such as using more ductile materials and/or by thermally or acoustically softening the materials during bonding. Metallic materials experience property changes when subjected to ultrasonic excitations, including acoustic softening, increase in crystallographic defects, and enhanced diffusivities. In particular, metal softening in the presence of ultrasonic excitations, known as the “Blaha effect” or “acoustic softening,” means that the magnitude of stresses necessary to initiate plastic deformation are signiﬁcantly lower [ 10]. The softening effect of ultrasonic energy on metals is similar to the effect of heating, and can in fact reduce the ﬂow stress of a metallic material more Fig. 9.10 SEM microstructures of Al 3003/SS mesh: ( a) SS mesh embedded between Al 3003 layers, ( b) Al 3003/SS mesh interface at a higher magniﬁcation.

The black arrows indicate areas of metallurgical bonding between SS mesh elements. #Emerald Group Publishing Limited, “Use of Ultrasonic Consolidation for Fabrication of Multi-Material Structures,” G.D. Janaki Ram, Chris Robinson, Yanzhe Yang and Brent Stucker, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 13 (4), pp. 226–235, 2007232 9 Sheet Lamination Processeseffectively than heating. Thus, acoustic softening results in plastic deformation at strains much less than would otherwise be needed to achieve plastic deformation. UAM processes also involve metal deformation at high strain rates. High strain rate deformation facilitates formation of vacancies within welded metals, and thus excess vacancy concentration grows rapidly. As a result, the ductility and diffusiv-ity of the metal are enhanced. Both of these characteristics aid in UAM bonding. 9.4.3 UAM Process Parameters and Process Optimization The important controllable process parameters of UAM are: (a) oscillation ampli-tude, (b) normal force, (c) travel speed, and (d) temperature. It has been found that the quality of bonding in UAM is signiﬁcantly affected by each of these process parameters. A brief discussion of each of these parameters and how they affectbonding in UAM follows. 9.4.3.1 Oscillation Amplitude Energy input directly affects the degree of elastic/plastic deformation betweenmating metal interfaces, and consequently affects bond formation. Oscillationamplitude and frequency of the sonotrode determine the amount of ultrasonicenergy available for bond formation. In commercial UAM machines, the frequency of oscillation is not adjustable, as it is preset based on sonotrode geometry, transducer and booster hardware, and the machine power supply. In UAM, thedirectly controllable parameter for ultrasonic energy input is oscillation amplitude. Generally speaking, the higher the oscillation amplitude, the greater the ultra- sonic energy delivered. Consequently, for greater energy, more elastic/plasticdeformation occurs at the mating metal interface and therefore better weldingquality is achieved. However, there is an optimum oscillation amplitude level fora particular foil thickness, geometry, and material combination. A sufﬁcient amount of ultrasonic energy input is needed to achieve plastic deformation, to help ﬁll the voids due to surface roughness that are inherently present at the interface. However,when energy input exceeds a critical level, bonding deteriorates as excess plasticdeformation can damage previously formed bonds at the welding interface due toexcessive stress and/or fatigue. 9.4.3.2 Normal Force Normal force is the load applied on the foil by the sonotrode, pressing the layerstogether. Sufﬁcient normal force is required to ensure that the ultrasonic energy inthe sonotrode is delivered to the foils to establish metallurgical bonds across the interface. This process parameter also has an optimized level for best bonding. A normal force higher or lower than the optimum level degrades the quality of bondsand lowers the LWD obtained. When normal force increases beyond the optimumlevel, the stress condition at the mating interface may be so severe that the formedbonds are damaged, just as it occurs when oscillation amplitude exceeds itsoptimum level.9.4 Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing 2339.4.3.3 Sonotrode Travel Speed Welding exposure time has a direct effect on bond strength during ultrasonic welding. In UAM welding, exposure time is determined by the travel speed of thesonotrode. Higher speeds result in shorter welding exposure times for a given area.Over-input of ultrasonic energy may cause destruction of previously formed metalbonds and metal fatigue. Thus, to avoid bond damage caused by excess ultrasonic energy, an optimum travel speed is important for strong bonds. 9.4.3.4 Preheat Temperature Metallurgical bonds can be established at ambient temperature during UAMprocessing. However, for many materials an increased preheat temperature facilitates bond formation. Heating directly beneﬁts bond formation by reducingthe ﬂow stress of metals. However, excess heating can have deleterious effects.High levels of metal foil softening can result in pieces of the metal foil sticking tothe sonotrode. In addition, in the case of fabrication of structures with embeddedelectronics, excess temperature may damage embedded electronics. For certainmaterials, such as Cu, enhanced oxide formation at elevated temperatures willimpede oxide removal. Finally, for some materials elevated temperatures cause metallurgical “aging” phenomena such as precipitation hardening, which can embrittle the material and cause premature part failure. 9.4.3.5 Other Parameters Metal foil thickness is another important factor to be considered in UAM. The mostcommon metal foils used in UAM are on the order of ~150 μm. Generally speaking, bonds are more easily formed between thin metal foils than between thick ones.However, foil damage is a major concern for UAM of thinner metal foils, as theyare easily scratched or bent; and thus metal foils between 100 and 200 μm are most often used in UAM. In addition to material-related constants, process optimization is inﬂuenced by the surface condition of the sonotrode, particularly the sonotrode surface roughness. A typical sonotrode in UAM is made of titanium or tool steel. The surface of the sonotrode is EDM roughened to enhance friction between the sonotrode and foilbeing deposited. However, surface roughness of the sonotrode decreases signiﬁ-cantly after extended use. Thus, optimized parameters change along with thecondition of the sonotrode surface. Thus it is necessary to practice regularsonotrode roughness measurements and modify process parameters accordingly.Also, the sonotrode surface roughness is imprinted onto the upper-most surface ofthe just-deposited foil (see upper surface of Fig. 9.9). As a result, this surface roughness must be overcome by plastic deformation during deposition of the next layer. Thus, an optimum surface roughness condition would be one which involvesno slip between the sonotrode and the foil being deposited, without signiﬁcantlyincreasing the surface roughness of the deposited foil. As slip often increases withdecreasing roughness, sonotrode surface roughness is inherently difﬁcult tooptimize.234 9 Sheet Lamination Processes9.4.4 Microstructures and Mechanical Properties of UAM Parts 9.4.4.1 Defects The most common defects in UAM-made parts are voids. Voids occur either along the interfaces between layers or between the foils that are laid side by side to form each layer. For ease of discussions, defects are classiﬁed into three types according to defect origin. Type-1 defects are the voids along layer/layer interfaces due to foil surface roughness and/or insufﬁcient input energy. Type-2 defects are damaged areas, also at the layer/layer interface, that are created when excess energy input during UAM results in the breaking of previously formed bonds. Type-3 defects are found between adjacent foils within a layer. One can identify defect types by observing the existence of oxide layers on the surfaces of the defects or by looking at the defect morphology. For Type-1 defects, since the metal surfaces have not bonded, oxide layers are not damaged and removed, and can be observed. In addition, Type-1 defects typically have a ﬂat upper surface and a rounded lower surface (where the ﬂat upper surface is the newly deposited, smooth foil and the rounded lower surface is the unbonded upper surface of the previously deposited foil, as seen in Fig. 9.11). For Type-2 defects, since bonding has occurred, oxide layers have been disturbed and are difﬁcult to locate. Type-2 defects thus have a different morphology than Type-1 defects, as they represent voids where the interface has been torn apart after bonding, rather than regions which have never bonded. Type-3 defects are the physical gaps between adjacent metal foils, as shown in Fig.9.12. In UAM, the foil width setting within the software determines the offset distance the sonotrode and foil placement mechanism are moved between Fig. 9.11 Type-1 UAM defect ( arrow indicates location of surface oxides)9.4 Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing 235depositions of adjacent foils within a layer. If the setting value is larger than the actual metal foil width, there will always be gaps between adjacent foils. The larger the width setting above the foil width, the larger the average physical gap. If the width setting is smaller than the actual width of the foil, gaps will be minimized. However, excess overlap results in surface unevenness at the overlapping areas and difﬁculty with welding. Thus, positioning inaccuracies of the foil placement mech- anism in a UAM machine, combined with improper width settings cause Type-3 defects. Defects strongly affect the strength of UAM parts. Process parameter optimiza- tion (including optimization of width settings) to maximize LWD and minimize Type-3 defects is the most effective means to increase bond strength. With optimized parameters, Type-1 and Type-3 defects are minimized and Type-2- defects do not occur. Type-1 defects can be reduced by surface machining a small amount of metal (~10 μm, or the largest roughness observed at the upper-most deposited surface, as in Fig. 9.9) after depositing each layer. Post-process heat treatment can also be used to signiﬁcantly reduce all types of defects. The degradation of part mechanical properties due to Type-3 defects can be reduced by designed arrangement of successive layers. Successive layers in a UAM part can be arranged so that 50 % overlap across layers is obtained, as shown in Fig. 9.13. Although somewhat counter-intuitive, it has been shown that better tensile properties result from a 50 % overlap than when random foil arrangements are used. Fig. 9.12 Type-3 defect observed between adjacent foils (Note the morphology of the Type-1 defects between layers indicate that this micrograph is upside-down with respect to build orientation)236 9 Sheet Lamination Processes9.4.4.2 UAM Microstructures Typical microstructures from Al 3003 tapes with representative defects were shown in Figs. 9.9and9.12. Figure 9.14 shows the microstructure of two Ni 201 foils deposited on an Al 3003 substrate. Plastic deformation of Ni foils near the foil surfaces can be experimentally visualized using orientation imaging microscopy, as shown in Fig. 9.15. Smooth intragrain color transition within a few grains at the surface indicates the foil interfaces undergo some plastic deformation during UAM processing, whereas the absence of intragranular color transitions away from the foil surfaces indicates that the original microstructure is retained in the bulk of the foil. In addition to UAM of similar materials, UAM of dissimilar materials is quite effective. Many dissimilar metal foils can be bonded with distinct interfaces, with a high degree of LWD and without intermetallic formation [ 11]. Fig. 9.13 Schematic illustrating ( a) 50 % foil overlap and ( b) random foil overlap in UAM Fig. 9.14 Ultrasonically consolidated Ni 201 foils9.4 Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing 2379.4.4.3 Mechanical Properties Mechanical properties of UAM parts are highly anisotropic due to the anisotropic properties of metal foils, the presence of defects in particular areas, and the alignment of grain boundaries along the foil-to-foil interfaces. Most metal foils used in UAM are prepared via rolling. Grains within the foils are often elongated along the rolling direction. As a result, foils are typically stronger along the rolling direction, and thus UAM parts are typically stronger in the x-axis than in the y- or z-axes. A typical transverse y-axis strength for a UAM part is about 85 % of the published bulk strength value for a particular material whereas the longitudinal x-axis strength typically exceeds published values for a material. In the z-direction, perpendicular to the layer interfaces, UAM parts are much weaker than the x and y properties. This is primarily due to the fact that the bond formed across the foil interfaces, even at 100 % LWD, is not as strong as the more isotropic inter-granular bonding within the foils. Thus, z-direction strength values are often 50 % of the published value for a particular material, with very little ductility. Thus, when considering UAM for part fabrication, it is important to consider the anisotropic aspects of UAM parts with respect to their design. Heat treatment can be used to normalize these properties if this anisotropy results in unacceptable properties. Another factor which affects mechanical properties is the interfacial plastic deformation which foils undergo during UAM. This plastic deformation increases the hardness of the metal as a result of work hardening effects. Although this work hardening improves the strength, it has a negative effect on ductility.

Each of these application areas is discussed below. 9.4.5.1 Internal Features As with other AM techniques, UAM is capable of producing complex internal features within metallic materials. These include honeycomb structures, internal pipes or channels, and enclosed cavities. During UAM, internal geometricalfeatures of a part are fabricated via CNC trimming before depositing the nextlayer (see Fig. 9.8). Not all internal feature types are possible, and all of the “top” surface of internal features will have a stair-step geometry and not a CNC-milledsurface, as the CNC can only mill the upward-facing surfaces of internalgeometries. After fabrication of an internal feature is completed, metal foils areplaced over the cavities or channels and welded, thus enclosing the internal features. It has been shown that it becomes quite difﬁcult to bond parts using UAM when their height-to-width ratio is near 1:1 [ 12]. In order to achieve higher ratios, support materials or other restraints are necessary to make the part rigid enough such thatthere is differential motion between the existing part and the foils that are beingadded. The development of an effective support material dispensing system forUAM would dramatically increase its ability to make more free-form shapes andlarger internal features. Without support materials, internal features must be designed and oriented in such a way that the sonotrode is always supported by an existing, rigid feature while depositing a subsequent layer. As a result, for instance,internal cooling channels cannot be perpendicular to the sonotrode traveling direc-tion, and honeycomb structures must be small enough that there are always at leasttwo ribs supporting the deposition of the foil face sheets. 9.4.5.2 Material Flexibility A wide range of metallic materials has been used with UAM. Theoretically, anymetal which can be ultrasonically welded is a candidate material for the UAMprocess. Materials which have been successfully bonded using UAM include Al3003 (H18 and O condition), Al 6061, Al 2024, Inconel ®600, brass, SS 316, SS 347, Ni 201, and high purity copper. Ultrasonic weldabilities of a number of othermetallic materials have been widely demonstrated [ 11,13–16]. Thus, there is signiﬁcant material ﬂexibility for UAM processes. In addition to metal foils, other materials have been used, including MetPreg ®(an alumina ﬁber-reinforced Al matrix composite tape) and prewoven stainless steel AISI 304 wire meshes (seeFig.9.10), which both have been bonded to Al 3003 using UAM. By depositing various metal foils at different desired layers or locations during UAM, multimaterial structures or functionally gradient materials can be produced.Composition variation and resultant property changes can be designed to meet9.4 Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing 239various application needs. For instance, by changing materials it is possible to optimize thermal conductivity, wear resistance, strength, ductility, and other properties at speciﬁc locations within a part. 9.4.5.3 Fiber Embedment One of the unique features of UAM is that it enables ﬁber embedment. As can be seen in Fig. 9.16, bonding near an embedded ﬁber is much better than bonding away from the ﬁber for a particular set of process parameter conditions. Plastic ﬂow predicted by modeling done at Shefﬁeld University by Mariani and Ghassemieh (2009) has shown that in some cases there can be one hundred times the degree of interfacial metal ﬂow in the presence of a ﬁber when compared to bonding of foils without a ﬁber. The most commonly embedded ﬁbers are silicon carbide structural ﬁbers within Al matrices (thus forming an Al/SiC metal matrix composite) and optical ﬁbers within Al matrices. Fibers can also be placed and embedded between dissimilar materials, as seen in Fig. 9.17. In the case of dissimilar materials, the presence of a stiff ﬁber exacerbates the plastic deformation between the stiffer and less stiff material, causing the material with a lower ﬂow stress to deform more than the higher ﬂow stress material. In addition, in contrast to the case of embedment between similar materials where the ﬁber center is typically aligned with the foil interfaces, the ﬁber is offset into the softer material (compare Figs. 9.16 and9.17). Embedded ceramic ﬁbers are typically mechanically entrapped within metal matrices, without any chemical bonding between ﬁber and matrix materials. As a result of this mechanical entrapment, friction aids in the transfer of tensile loads from the matrix to the ﬁber, thus strengthening the part, whereas the lack of chemical bonding means that there is little resistance to shear loading at the ﬁber/ matrix interface, thus weakening the structure for this failure mode. Fig. 9.16 SEM microstructures of Al 3003/SiC: ( a) SiC ﬁber embedded between Al 3003 layers showing a lack of defects near the ﬁber and ( b) the same SiC ﬁber at a higher magniﬁcation showing excellent bonding near the ﬁber. #Emerald Group Publishing Limited, “Use of Ultrasonic Consolidation for Fabrication of Multi-Material Structures,” G.D. Janaki Ram, Chris Robinson, Yanzhe Yang and Brent Stucker, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 13 (4), pp. 226–235, 2007240 9 Sheet Lamination ProcessesUAM is a candidate manufacturing process for fabrication of long-ﬁber- reinforced metal matrix composites (MMC). However, to utilize UAM to make end-use MMC parts, several technical difﬁculties need to be overcome, including automatic ﬁber feeding and alignments mechanisms, and the ability to change the ﬁber/foil direction between layers. Optical ﬁbers have been successfully embedded by many researchers world- wide. Since UAM operates at relatively low processing temperatures, many types of optical ﬁbers can be deposited without damage, thus enabling data and energy to be optically transported through the metal structure. 9.4.5.4 Smart Structures Smart structures are structures which can sense, transmit, control, and/or react to data, such as environmental conditions. In a smart structure, sensors, actuators, processors, thermal management devices, and more can be integrated to achieve a desired functionality (see Fig. 9.18). Fabrication of smart structures is difﬁcult for conventional manufacturing processes, as they do not enable full three-dimensional control over geometry, composition and/or placement of components. AM pro- cesses are inherently suited to the fabrication of smart structures and UAM, in particular, offers several advantages. Primarily due to the fact that UAM is the only AM process whereby metal structures can be formed at low temperatures, UAM offers excellent processing capability for fabrication of smart structures. In addition to traditional internal self-supporting features (honeycomb structures, cooling channels, etc.), larger internal cavities can designed to enable placement of Fig. 9.17 SiC Fiber embedded between copper and aluminum using UAM. Black arrows denote regions where the softer Al extruded around the ﬁber during embedment, resulting in displacement of the ﬁber away from the interface into the Al base material9.4 Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing 241electronics, actuators, heat pipes, or other features at optimum location within a structure [ 17]. Many types of embedded electronics, sensors, and thermal manage- ment devices have been inserted into UAM cavities. Sensors for recording temper-ature, acceleration, stress, strain, magnetism, and other environmental factors havebeen fully encapsulated and have remained functional after UAM embedment. In addition to prefabricated electronics, it is feasible to fabricate customized electron- ics in UAM with the integration of direct write technologies (see Chap. 11). By combining UAM with direct write, electronic features (conductors, insulators,batteries, capacitors, etc.) can be directly created within or on UAM-madestructures in an automated manner. 9.5 Conclusions As illustrated in this chapter, a broad range of sheet lamination techniques exist.From the initial LOM paper-based technology to the more recent UAM approach,sheet lamination processes have shown themselves to be robust, ﬂexible, andvaluable for many applications and materials. The basic method of trimming asheet of material to form a cross-sectional layer is inherently fast, as trimming onlyoccurs at the layer’s outline rather than needing to melt or cure the entire cross-sectional area to form a layer. This means that sheet lamination approaches exhibit the speed beneﬁts of a layer-wise process while still utilizing a point-wise energy source. Many variations of sheet lamination processes have been demonstrated,which have proved to be suitable for many different types of metal, ceramic,polymer, and paper materials.

As these developments occur, sheet lamination techniques will likely move from the fringe of AM to a more central role in the future of many types of products. 9.6 Exercises Discuss the beneﬁts and drawbacks of bond-then-form versus form-then-bond approaches.

Loughborough, England244 9 Sheet Lamination ProcessesDirected Energy Deposition Processes10 10.1 Introduction Directed energy deposition (DED) processes enable the creation of parts by melting material as it is being deposited. Although this basic approach can work for polymers, ceramics, and metal matrix composites, it is predominantly used for metal powders. Thus, this technology is often referred to as “metal deposition”technology. DED processes direct energy into a narrow, focused region to heat a substrate, melting the substrate and simultaneously melting material that is being depositedinto the substrate’s melt pool. Unlike powder bed fusion techniques (see Chap. 5) DED processes are NOT used to melt a material that is pre-laid in a powder bed butare used to melt materials as they are being deposited . DED processes use a focused heat source (typically a laser or electron beam) to melt the feedstock material and build up three-dimensional objects in a mannersimilar to the extrusion-based processes from Chap. 6. Each pass of the DED head creates a track of solidiﬁed material, and adjacent lines of material make up layers.Complex three-dimensional geometry requires either support material or amultiaxis deposition head. A schematic representation of a DED process usingpowder feedstock material and laser is shown in Fig. 10.1. Commercial DED processes include using a laser or electron beam to melt powders or wires. In many ways, DED techniques can be used in an identical manner to laser cladding and plasma welding machines. For the purposes of thischapter, however, DED machines are considered those which are designed to createcomplex 3D shapes directly from CAD ﬁles, rather than the traditional welding andcladding technologies, which were designed for repair, joining, or to apply coatingsand do not typically use 3D CAD data as an input format. A number of organizations have developed DED machines using lasers and powder feeders. These machines have been referred to as Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) [ 1], Directed Light Fabrication (DLF) [ 2], Direct Metal Deposi- tion (DMD), 3D Laser Cladding, Laser Generation, Laser-Based Metal Deposition #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_10245(LBMD), Laser Freeform Fabrication (LFF), Laser Direct Casting, LaserCast [ 3], Laser Consolidation, LasForm, and others. Although the general approach is thesame, differences between these machines commonly include changes in laserpower, laser spot size, laser type, powder delivery method, inert gas deliverymethod, feedback control scheme, and/or the type of motion control utilized. Because these processes all involve deposition, melting and solidiﬁcation of pow- dered material using a traveling melt pool, the resulting parts attain a high densityduring the build process. The microstructure of parts made from DED processes(Figs. 10.2 and10.3) are similar to powder bed fusion processes ( seeFig. 5.14), wherein each pass of the laser or heat source creates a track of rapidly solidiﬁedmaterial. As can be seen from Figs. 10.2 and10.3, the microstructure of a DED part can be different between layers and even within layers. In the Ti/TiC deposit shown in Fig.10.2, the larger particles present in the microstructure are unmelted carbides. The presence of fewer unmelted carbides in a particular region is due to a higheroverall heat input for that region of the melt pool. By changing process parameters,it is possible to create fewer or more unmelted carbides within a layer, and byincreasing laser power, for instance, a greater amount of the previously depositedlayer (or substrate for the ﬁrst layer) will be remelted. By comparing the thicknessof the last-deposited layer with the ﬁrst- or second-deposited layer (such as inFig. 10.3a ), an estimate of the proportion of a layer that is remelted during subsequent deposition can be made. Each of these issues is discussed in the following section. Laser beam Powder Feed Nozzles Powder stream Layer thickness Track widthMotionFig. 10.1 Schematic of a typical laser powder DED process246 10 Directed Energy Deposition Processes10.2 General DED Process Description As the most common type of DED system is a powder-based laser deposition system optimized for metals, we will use a typical LBMD process as the paradigm process against which other processes will be compared. In LBMD, a “deposition head” is utilized to deposit material onto the substrate. A deposition head is typically an integrated collection of laser optics, powder nozzle(s), inert gas tubing, and in some cases, sensors. The substrate can be either a ﬂat plate on which a new Fig. 10.2 LENS-deposited Ti/TiC metal matrix composite structure (four layers on top of a Ti substrate) Fig. 10.3 CoCrMo deposit on CoCrMo: ( a) side view (every other layer is deposited perpendic- ular to the previous layer using a 0,90,0 pattern) and ( b) top view of deposit10.2 General DED Process Description 247part will be fabricated or an existing part onto which additional geometry will be added. Deposition is controlled by relative differential motion between the sub-strate and deposition head. This differential motion is accomplished by moving the deposition head, by moving the substrate, or by a combination of substrate and deposition head motion. 3-axis systems, whereby the deposition occurs in a verticalmanner, are typical. However, 4- or 5-axis systems using either rotary tables orrobotic arms are also available. In addition, numerous companies have started tosell LBMD deposition heads as “tools” for inclusion in multi-tool-changer CNCmilling machines. By integration into a CNC milling machine, a LBMD head canenable additive plus subtractive capabilities in one apparatus. This is particularlyuseful for overhaul and repair (as discussed below). The kinetic energy of powder particles being fed from a powder nozzle into the melt pool is greater than the effect of gravity on powders during ﬂight. As a result,nonvertical deposition is just as effective as vertical deposition. Multiaxis deposi-tion head motion is therefore possible and indeed quite useful. In particular, if thesubstrate is very large and/or heavy, it is easier to accurately control the motion ofthe deposition head than the substrate. Conversely, if the substrate is a simple ﬂatplate, it is easier to move the substrate than the deposition head. Thus, depending onthe geometries desired and whether new parts will be fabricated onto ﬂat plates or new geometry will be added to existing parts, the optimum design of a LBMD apparatus will change. In LBMD, the laser generates a small molten pool (typically 0.25–1 mm in diameter and 0.1–0.5 mm in depth) on the substrate as powder is injected into thepool. The powder is melted as it enters the pool and solidiﬁes as the laser beammoves away. Under some conditions, the powder can be melted during ﬂight andarrive at the substrate in a molten state; however, this is atypical and the normalprocedure is to use process parameters that melt the substrate and powder as they enter the molten pool. The typical small molten pool and relatively rapid traverse speed combine to produce very high cooling rates (typically 10 3–105/C14C/s) and large thermal gradients. Depending upon the material or alloy being deposited, these high coolingrates can produce unique solidiﬁcation grain structures and/or nonequilibrium grainstructures which are not possible using traditional processing. At lower coolingrates, such as when using higher beam powers or lower traverse speeds—which istypical when using electron beams rather than lasers for DED—the grain features grow and look more like cast grain structures. The passing of the beam creates a thin track of solidiﬁed metal deposited on and welded to the layer below. A layer is generated by a number of consecutiveoverlapping tracks. The amount of track overlap is typically 25 % of the trackwidth (which results in re-melting of previously deposited material) and typicallayer thicknesses employed are 0.25–0.5 mm. After each layer is formed, thedeposition head moves away from the substrate by one layer thickness.248 10 Directed Energy Deposition Processes10.3 Material Delivery DED processes can utilize both powder and wire feedstock material. Each has limitations and drawbacks with respect to each other. 10.3.1 Powder Feeding Powder is the most versatile feedstock, and most metal and ceramic materials arereadily available in powder form. However, not all powder is captured in the meltpool (e.g., less than 100 % powder capture efﬁciency), so excess powder is utilized.Care must be taken to ensure excess powder is recaptured in a clean state ifrecycling is desired. Excess powder feeding is not necessarily a negative attribute, as it makes DED processes geometrically ﬂexible and forgiving. This is due to the fact that excess powder ﬂow enables the melt pool size to dynamically change. As described below, DED processes using powder feeding can enable overlapping scan lines to be usedwithout the swelling or overfeeding problems inherent in material extrusion pro-cesses (discussed in Sect. 6.3). In DED, the energy density of the beam must be above a critical amount to form a melt pool on the substrate. When a laser is focused to a small spot size, there is aregion above and below the focal plane where the laser energy density is highenough to form a melt pool. This region is labeled in Fig. 10.4. If the substrate surface is either too far above or too far below the focal plane, no melt pool will form. Similarly, the melt pool will not grow to a height that moves the surface of themelt pool outside this region. Within this critical beam energy density region, the height and volume of the deposit melt pool is dependent upon melt pool location with respect to the focalplane, scan rate, laser power, powder ﬂow rate, and surface morphology. Thus, for agiven set of parameters, the deposit height approaches the layer thickness offsetvalue only after a number of layers of deposition. This is evident, for instance, in Fig.10.2, where a constant layer thickness of 200 μm was used as the deposition head z-offset for each layer. The substrate was initially located within the buried spot region, but not far enough within it to achieve the desired thickness for thelayers shown (i.e., the laser power, scan rate, and powder ﬂow settings caused thedeposit to be thicker than the layer thickness speciﬁed). Thus, deposit thicknessapproached the layer thickness z-offset as the spot became effectively more “buried” during each subsequent layer addition. In Fig. 10.2, however, too few layers were deposited to reach the steady-state layer thickness value. If the laser and scanning parameters settings used are inherently incapable of producing a deposit thickness at least as thick as the layer thickness z-offset value, subsequent layers will become thinner and thinner. Eventually, no deposit willoccur when scanning for the next layer starts outside the critical energy densityregion (i.e., when the substrate starts out below the exposed spot region, there isinsufﬁcient energy density to form a melt pool on the substrate).10.3 Material Delivery 249In practice, when the ﬁrst layer is formed on a substrate, the laser focal plane is typically buried below the surface of the substrate approximately 1 mm. In this way, a portion of the substrate material is melted and becomes a part of the melt pool.The ﬁrst layer, in this case, will be made up of a mixture of melted substratecombined with material from the powder feeders, and the amount of material addedto the surface for the ﬁrst layer is dependent upon process parameters and focalplane location with respect to the substrate surface. If little mixing of the substrateand deposited material is desired, then the focal plane should be placed at or abovethe substrate surface to minimize melting of the substrate—resulting in a melt pool made up almost entirely of the powdered material. This may be desirable, for instance, when depositing a ﬁrst layer of “material A” on top of “material B” thatmight form “intermetallic AB” if mixed in a molten state. In order to suppressintermetallic formation, a sharp transition from A to B is typically required. In summary, the ﬁrst few layers may be thicker or thinner than the layer thickness set by the operator, depending upon the focal plane location with respectto the substrate surface and the process parameters chosen. As a result, the layerthickness converges to the steady-state layer thickness setting after several layers or, if improper parameters are utilized, the laser “walks away” from the substrate and deposition stops after a few layers. The dynamic thickness beneﬁts of powder feeding also help overcome the corrugated surface topology associated with DED. This corrugated topology canbe seen in Fig. 10.3b and is a remnant of the set of parallel, deposited tracks (beads) of material which make up a layer. As in extrusion-based AM processes, in DED asubsequent layer is typically deposited in a different orientation than the previouslayer. Common scan patterns from layer to layer are typically multiples of 30, 45, and 90 /C14(e.g., 0, 90, 0, 90 ...; 0, 90, 180, 270, 360 ...; 0, 45, 90 ...315, 360 ...; and 0, 30, 60 ...330, 360 ...). Layer orientations can also be randomized between layers at preset multiples. The main beneﬁts of changing orientation from layer to layerBuried spot regionLaser beamFocusing Optics Spot size at focal planeCritical beam energy density for meltingExposed spot regionFig. 10.4 Schematic illustrating laser optics and energy density terminology for directed energy deposition250 10 Directed Energy Deposition Processesare the elimination of preferential grain growth (which otherwise makes the properties anisotropic) and minimization of residual stresses. Changing orientation between layers can be accomplished easily when using powders, as the presence of excess powder ﬂow provides for dynamic leveling of the deposit thickness and melt pool at each region of the deposited layer. Thismeans that powdered material feedstock allows the melt pool size to dynamicallychange to ﬁll the bottoms of the corrugated texture without growing too thick at thetop of each corrugation. This is not as easy for wire feeding. Powder is typically fed by ﬁrst ﬂuidizing a container of powder material (by bubbling up a gas through the powder and/or applying ultrasonic vibration)and then using a pressure drop to transfer the ﬂuidized powder from the container to the laser head through tubing. Powder is focused at the substrate/laser interaction zone using either coaxial feeding, 4-nozzle feeding, or single nozzle feeding. In thecase of coaxial feeding, the powder is introduced as a toroid surrounding the laserbeam, which is focused to a small spot size using shielding gas ﬂow, as illustrated inFig. 10.5a . The two main beneﬁts of coaxial feeding are that it enables a higher capture efﬁciency of powder, and the focusing shielding gas can protect the meltpool from oxidation when depositing in the presence of air. Single nozzle feedinginvolves a single nozzle pointed at the interaction zone between the laser and substrate. The main beneﬁts of single nozzle feeding are the apparatus simplicity (and thus lower cost), a better powder capture efﬁciency than 4-nozzle feeding, andthe ability to deposit material into tight locations (such as when adding material tothe inside of a channel or tube). The main drawback of single nozzle feeding is thatthe melt pool geometry is direction speciﬁc (i.e., the melt pool is different whenfeeding towards the nozzle, versus away from the nozzle or at right angles to thenozzle). 4-nozzle feeding involves 4 separate nozzle heads equally spaced at 90 /C14 increments around the laser beam, focused to intersect at the melt pool. The main beneﬁt of a 4-nozzle feeding system is that the ﬂow characteristics of 4-nozzle feeding gives more consistency in build height for complex and arbitrary 3Dgeometries that involve combinations of thick and thin regions. 10.3.2 Wire Feeding In the case of wire feeding, the volume of the deposit is always the volume of thewire that has been fed, and there is 100 % feedstock capture efﬁciency (minus alittle “splatter” from the melt pool). Wires are most effective for simple geometries,“blocky” geometries without many thin/thick transitions, or for coating of surfaces.When complex, large, and/or fully dense parts are desired, geometry-related pro- cess parameters (such as hatch width, layer thickness, wire diameter, and wire feed rate) must be carefully controlled to achieve a proper deposit size and shape. Just asin extrusion-based processes, large deposits with geometric complexity must haveporosity designed into them to remain geometrically accurate. For certain geometries, it is not possible to control the geometry-related process parameters accurately enough to achieve both high accuracy and low porosity with10.3 Material Delivery 251a wire feeder unless periodic subtractive processing (such as CNC machining) is done to reset the geometry to a known state. For most applications of DED low porosity is more important than geometric accuracy. Thus, wire-based DED scan processes are designed to be pore free, at the sacriﬁce of dimensional accuracy. Thus, the selection of a wire feeding system versus a powder feeding system is best done after determining what type of deposit geometries are required, whether dimensional accuracy is critical, and whether a subtractive milling system will be integrated with the additive deposition head. 10.4 DED Systems 10.4.1 Laser Based Metal Deposition Processes One of the ﬁrst commercialized DED processes, LENS, was developed by Sandia National Laboratories, USA, and commercialized by Optomec, USA. Optomec’s “LENS 750” machine was launched in 1997. Subsequently, the company launched its “LENS 850” and “LENS 850-R” with larger build volume (460/C2460/C21,070 mm) and dual laser head capability. Optomec’s machines originally used an Nd-YAG laser, but more recent machines, such as their MR-7 research system, utilize ﬁber lasers. LENS machines process materials in an enclosed inert gas chamber ( see Fig.10.6). An oxygen removal, gas recirculation system is used to keep the oxygen concentration in the gas (typically argon) near or below 10 ppm oxygen. This is several orders of magnitude cleaner than the inert gas systems used in powder bed Fig. 10.5 Illustration of powder nozzle conﬁgurations: ( a) coaxial nozzle feeding and ( b) single- nozzle feeding252 10 Directed Energy Deposition Processesfusion machines. The inert gas chamber, laser type, and 4-nozzle feeder design utilized by Optomec make their LENS machines some of the most ﬂexibleplatforms for DED, as many materials can be effectively processed with thiscombination of laser type and atmospheric conditions. Most LENS machines are 3-axis and do not use closed-loop feedback control, however 5-axis “laser wrist” systems can enable deposition from any orientation, and systems for monitoringbuild height and melt pool area can be used to dynamically change processparameters to maintain constant deposit characteristics. POM Group, USA, is another company building LBMD machines, although they were recently acquired by a company called DM3D Technology. Their DEDmachines with 5-axis, coaxial powder feed capability build parts using a shieldinggas approach. A key feature of DM3D Technology machines has always been the integrated closed-loop control system ( seeFig.10.7). The feedback control system adjusts process variables such as powder ﬂow rate, deposition velocity, and laserpower to maintain deposit conditions. Closed loop control of DED systems has beenshown to be effective at maintaining build quality. Thus, not only do DM3DTechnology and Optomec machines offer this option, but so do competingLBMD machine manufacturers as well as companies building electron beamDED machines that utilize wire feeders. DM3D Technology machines have histor-ically utilized CO 2lasers, which have the beneﬁt of being an economical, high- powered heat source. But the absorptivity of most materials is much less at CO 2 laser wavelengths than for Nd-YAG or ﬁber lasers (as discussed in Chap. 5and shown in Fig. 5.10) and thus almost all new DED machines now utilize ﬁber, diode, Fig. 10.6 Optomec LENS® 750 system (courtesy Optomec)10.4 DED Systems 253or Nd-YAG lasers. For machines where CO 2lasers are still used, in order to compensate for their lower absorptivity a larger amount of laser energy is applied,resulting in a larger heat-affected zone and overall heat input. Another company which was involved early in the development of DED machines was AeroMet Inc., USA—until the division was closed in 2005. TheAeroMet machine was speciﬁcally developed for producing large aerospace “rib-on-plate” components using prealloyed titanium powders and an 18 kW CO 2laser (seeFig. 10.8). Although they were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of building rib-on-plate structures cost-effectively, the division was not sustainableﬁnancially and was closed. The characteristics of using such a high-powered laserare that large deposits can be made quite quickly, but at the cost of geometricprecision and a much larger heat-affected zone. Companies which today areinterested in the high-deposition-rate characteristics of the AeroMet machine typi-cally choose to use electron beam energy sources with wire feed, and thus there areno commercially available LBMD machines similar to AeroMet’s machines. The beneﬁts behind adding features to simple shapes to form aerospace and other structures with an otherwise poor “buy-to-ﬂy” ratio is compelling. The termbuy-to-ﬂy refers to the amount of wrought material that is purchased as a block that CO2 Laser Beam Final Focus Optics To Powder Feeder Feedback Sensor 2 Solid Free From Shape by DirectDeposition Substract or Die PreformNozzle Shielding Gas Feedback Sensor 1 Workholding Fixture Patent Awarded Fig. 10.7 POM DED machine schematic (courtesy POM)254 10 Directed Energy Deposition Processesis required to form a complex part. In many cases, 80 % or more of the material is machined away to provide a stiff, lightweight frame for aerospace structures. Bybuilding ribs onto ﬂat plates using DED, the amount of waste material can bereduced signiﬁcantly. This has both signiﬁcant cost and environmental beneﬁts.This is also true for other geometries where small features protrude from a large object, thus requiring a signiﬁcant waste of material when machined from a block. This beneﬁt is illustrated in the electronics housing deposited using LENS on thehemispherical plate shown in Fig. 10.9. Another example of LBMD is the laser consolidation process from Accufusion, Canada. The key features of this process are the small spot-size laser, accuratemotion control, and single-nozzle powder feeding. This enables the creation ofsmall parts with much better accuracy and surface ﬁnish than other DED processes,but with the drawback of a signiﬁcantly lower deposition rate. Controlled Metal Buildup (CMB) is a hybrid metal deposition process developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology, Germany. It illustrates anintegrated additive and subtractive manufacturing approach that a number ofresearch organizations are experimenting with around the globe. In CMB, a diodelaser beam is used and the build material is introduced in the form of a wire. Afterdepositing a layer, it is shaped to the corresponding slice contour by a high-speedmilling cutter. The use of milling after each deposited layer eliminates the geomet-ric drawbacks of a wire feeder and enables highly accurate parts to be built. The process has been applied primarily to weld repairs and modiﬁcations to tools and dies. Subsequent to CMB’s success, several of the DED machine manufacturersnow offer their LBMD deposition heads for integration into subtractive machine Fig. 10.8 AeroMet System (courtesy MTS Systems Corp.)10.4 DED Systems 255tools, and a new company, Hybrid Manufacturing Technologies, was formed speciﬁcally to design, build, and integrate LBMD heads into existing CNC machinetool platforms. 10.4.2 Electron Beam Based Metal Deposition Processes Electron Beam Freeform Fabrication (EBF3) was developed by NASA Langley, USA, as a way to fabricate and/or repair aerospace structures both terrestrially andin future space-based systems. Using an electron beam as a thermal source and awire feeder, EBF 3is capable of rapid deposition under high current ﬂows, or more accurate depositions using slower deposition rates. The primary considerationswhich led to the development of EBF 3for space-based applications include: electron beams are much more efﬁcient at converting electrical energy into a beam than most lasers, which conserves scarce electrical resources; electronbeams work effectively in a vacuum but not in the presence of inert gases andthus are well suited for the space environment; and powders are inherently difﬁcultto contain safely in low-gravity environments and thus wire feeding is preferred. Sciaky, USA, has developed a number of electron beam based DED machines which utilize wire feedstock. These Sciaky machines are built inside very largevacuum chambers and enable depositions within a build volume exceeding 6 m in their largest dimension. These machines are excellent at building large, bulky deposits very quickly, enabling large rib-on-plate structures and other deposits tobe produced (typically for aerospace applications), eliminating the long lead-timesneeded for the forged components they replace. Fig. 10.9 Electronics Housing in 316SS (Courtesy Optomec and Sandia National Laboratories)256 10 Directed Energy Deposition Processes10.4.3 Other DED Processes Several research groups have investigated the use of welding and/or plasma-based technologies as a heat source for DED. One such group at Southern Methodist University, USA, has utilized gas metal arc welding combined with 4- ½axis milling to produce three-dimensional structures. Similar work has also beendemonstrated by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology, whichdemonstrated combined CO 2arc welding and 5-axis milling for part production. These approaches are viable and useful as lower-cost alternatives to laser andelectron beam approaches, however the typically larger heat-affected zone andother process control issues have kept these approaches from widespreadcommercialization. A number of other DED machine architectures and materials have been explored. In addition to multiple investigators who have demonstrated theprocessing of ceramics using a standard LENS process, other researchers haveinvestigated almost any type of powder which can theoretically be melted using athermal energy sources. For instance, plastic powder or even table sugar can beblown into a melt pool produced by a hot air gun to produce plastic or sugar parts.Although to date only metal-focused systems have been commercialized, it is likelyonly a matter of time before different material systems and machine architectures for DED become commercially viable. 10.5 Process Parameters Most AM machines come pre-programmed with optimized process parameters for materials sold by the machine vendors, but DED machines are sold as ﬂexibleplatforms; and thus DED users must identify the correct process parameters fortheir application and material. Optimum process parameters are material dependentand application/geometry dependent. Important process parameters include trackscan spacing, powder feed rate, beam traverse speed, beam power, and beam spot size. Powder feed rate, beam power, and traverse speed are all interrelated; for instance, an increase in feed rate has a similar effect to lowering the beam power.Likewise, increasing beam power or powder feed rate and decreasing traverse speedall increase deposit thickness. From an energy standpoint, as the scan speed isincreased, the input beam energy decreases because of the shorter dwell time,resulting in a smaller melt pool on the substrate and more rapid cooling. Scan patterns also play an important role in part quality. As mentioned previ- ously, it may be desirable to change the scan orientation from layer to layer to minimize residual stress buildup. Track width hatch spacing must be set so that adjacent beads overlap, and layer thickness settings must be less than the melt pooldepth to produce a fully dense product. Sophisticated accessory equipment for meltpool imaging and real-time deposit height measurement for accurately monitoringthe melt pool and deposit characteristics are worthwhile additions for repeatability,as it is possible to use melt pool size, shape, and temperature as feedback control10.5 Process Parameters 257inputs to maintain desired pool characteristics. To control deposit thickness, travel speed can be dynamically changed based upon sensor feedback. Similarly to controlsolidiﬁcation rate, and thus microstructure and properties, the melt pool size can be monitored and then controlled by dynamically changing laser power. 10.6 Typical Materials and Microstructure DED processes aim to produce fully dense functional parts. Any powder material or powder mixture which is stable in a molten pool can be used for construction ofparts. In general, metals with high reﬂectivities and thermal conductivities aredifﬁcult to process, such as gold and some alloys of aluminum and copper. Mostother metals are quite straightforward to process, unless there is improper atmo-spheric preparation and bonding is inhibited by oxide formation. Generally, metal-lic materials that exhibit reasonably good weldability are easy to process. Ceramics are more difﬁcult to process, as few can be heated to form a molten pool. Even in the event that a ceramic material can be melted, cracking often occursduring cooling due to thermal shock. Thus, most ceramics that are processed usingDED are processed as part of a ceramic or metal matrix composite. For powder feedstock, the powder size typically ranges from approximately 20– 150μm. It is within this range that powder particles can be most easily ﬂuidized and delivered using a ﬂowing gas. Blended elemental powders can be used to producean inﬁnite number of alloy combinations, or prealloyed powders can be used. Elemental powders can be delivered in precise amounts to the melt zone using separate feeders to generate various alloys and/or composite materials in-situ.When using elemental powders for generation of an alloy in-situ, the enthalpy ofmixing plays an important role in determining the homogeneity of the depositedalloy. A negative enthalpy of mixing (heat release) promotes homogeneous mixingof constituent elements and, therefore, such alloy systems are quite suitable forprocessing using elemental powders. The fruitfulness of creating multimaterial or gradient material combinations to investigate material properties quickly is illustrated in Figs. 10.10 and 10.11 . Figure 10.10 illustrates a tensile bar made with a smooth 1D transition between Ti-6-4 and Ti-22-23, where Fig. 10.11 illustrates the yield strength of various combinations of these alloys. Using optical methods, localized stress and strainﬁelds can be calculated during a tensile test and correlated back to the alloycombination for that location. Using this methodology, the properties of a widerange of alloy combinations can be investigated in a single experiment. Creatinglarger samples with 2D transitions of alloys (alloy transitions both longitudinally and transversely to the test axis using 3 or 4 powder feeders) can enable even greater numbers of alloy combinations to be investigated simultaneously. DED processes can involve extremely high solidiﬁcation cooling rates, from 10 3 to as high as 105/C14C/s. (This is also true for metal PBF processes, and thus the following discussion is also relevant to parts made using metal PBF.) High coolingrates can lead to several microstructural advantages, including: (a) suppression of258 10 Directed Energy Deposition Processesdiffusion controlled solid-state phase transformations; (b) formation of supersatu- rated solutions and nonequilibrium phases; (c) formation of extremely ﬁnemicrostructures with dramatically reduced elemental segregation; and(d) formation of very ﬁne secondary phase particles (inclusions, carbides, etc.). Parts produced using DED experience a complex thermal history in a manner very similar to multi-pass weld deposits. Changes in cooling rate during part construc-tion can occur due to heat buildup, especially in thin-wall sections. Also, energyintroduced during deposition of subsequent layers can reheat previously depositedmaterial, changing the microstructure of previously deposited layers. The thermalhistory, including peak temperatures, time at peak temperature, and cooling rates,can be different at each point in a part, leading to phase transformations and avariety of microstructures within a single component. As shown in Figs. 10.2,10.3, and 10.10 , parts made using DED typically exhibit a layered microstructure with an extremely ﬁne solidiﬁcation substructure. Theinterface region generally shows no visible porosity and a thin heat-affected zone Fig. 10.10 Smooth transition between a 100 % Ti-6-4 and 100 % Ti-22-23 alloy in the gage section of atensile bar.

Some materials exhibit pronounced columnar grain structures aligned in the laser scan direction, while some materials exhibit ﬁne equiaxed structures. The deposited material generally shows no visible porosity, although gas evolution during melting due to excess moisture in the powder or from entrapped gases in gas-atomized powders can cause pores in the deposit. Pores can also result if excess energy is utilized, resulting in material vaporization and “keyholing.” Parts generally show excellent layer-to-layer bonding, although lack-of-fusion defects can form at layer interfaces when the process parameters are not properly optimized and insufﬁcient energy density is utilized. Residual stresses are generated as a result of solidiﬁcation, which can lead to cracking during or after part construction. For example, LENS deposited TiC ceramic structures are prone to cracking as a result of residual stresses (Fig. 10.13 ). Residual stresses pose a particularly signiﬁcant problem when dealing with metallurgically incompatible dissimilar material combinations. Formation of brittle intermetallic phases formed at the interface of dissimilar materials in combination with residual stresses can also lead to cracking. This can be overcome by suppressing the formation of intermetallics using appropriate processing parameters or by the use of a suitable interlayer. For instance, in several research projects, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to suppress the formation of brittle intermetallics when depositing Ti on CoCrMo by placing the focal plane above the CoCrMo substrate during deposition of the ﬁrst layer, and depositing a thin coating of Ti using a low laser power and rapid scan rate. Subsequent layers are likewise deposited using relatively thin deposits at high scan rates and low laser power to avoid reheating of the Ti/CoCrMo interface. Once a sufﬁcient Ti deposit is accumulated, normal process parameters for higher deposition rate can be utilized. However, if excess heat is introduced either during Fig. 10.12 CoCrMo LENS deposit on a wrought CoCrMo substrate of the same composition (deposit occurred from the right of the picture)260 10 Directed Energy Deposition Processesthe deposition of subsequent layers or in subsequent heat treatment, equilibrium intermetallics will form and cracking and delamination occurs. In other work, CoCrMo has been successfully deposited on a porous Ta substrate when employing Zr as an interlayer material, a combination that is otherwise prone to cracking and delamination. It is common for laser deposited parts to exhibit superior yield and tensile strengths because of their ﬁne grain structure. Ductility of DED parts, however, is generally considered to be inferior to wrought or cast equivalents. Layer orientation can have a great inﬂuence on % elongation, with the worst being the zdirection. However, in many alloys ductility can be recovered and anisotropy minimized by heat treatment—without signiﬁcant loss of strength in most cases. 10.7 Processing–Structure–Properties Relationships Parts produced in DED processes exhibit high cooling rate cast microstructures. Processing conditions inﬂuence the solidiﬁcation microstructure in ways that can be predicted in part by rapid solidiﬁcation theory. For a speciﬁc material, solidiﬁcation microstructure depends on the local solidiﬁcation conditions, speciﬁcally the solid- iﬁcation rate and temperature gradient at the solid/liquid interface. By calculating the solidiﬁcation rate and thermal gradient, the microstructure can be predicted based upon calibrated “solidiﬁcation maps” from the literature. To better understand solidiﬁcation microstructures in DED processes, Beuth and Klingbeil [ 5] have developed procedures for calculating thermal gradients, G, and solidiﬁcation rates, R, analytically and numerically. These calculated Gand Rvalues can then be plotted on solidiﬁcation maps to determine the types of microstructures which can be achieved with different DED equipment, process parameters, and material combinations. Solutions for both thin walls [ 5] and bulky deposits [ 6] have been described. For brevity’s sake, the latter work by Bontha Fig. 10.13 Cracks in a TiC LENS deposit due to residual stresses [ 4] (SCRIPTA MATERIALIA by Weiping Liu, and J. N. DuPont.

[ 6] based upon the 3D Rosenthal solution for a moving point heat source on an inﬁnite substrate will be introduced here (Fig. 10.14 ). This 3D Rosenthal solution also has been applied to PBF techniques in an identical fashion. In this simpliﬁed model, material deposition is ignored. The model considers only heat conduction within the melt pool and substrate due to a traveling heat source moving at velocity, V. The fraction of impinging energy absorbed is αQ, which is a simpliﬁcation of the physically complex temperature-dependent absorp- tion of the beam by regions of the melt pool and solid, absorption of energy by powder in ﬂight, and other factors. Thus a single parameter, α, represents the fraction of impinging beam energy power absorbed. It is assumed the beam moves only in the xdirection, and thus the beam’s relative coordinates ( x0,y0,z0) from Fig. 10.14 are related to the ﬁxed coordinates (x,y,z) at any time tas (x0,y0,z0)¼(x/C0Vt,y,z). With the above conditions, the Rosenthal solution for temperature Tat time tfor any location in an inﬁnite half-space can be expressed in dimensionless form as: T¼e/C0x0þﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ x2 0þy2 0þz2 0p/C0/C1 2ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ x2 0þy2 0þz2 0q ð10:1Þ where T¼T/C0T0 αQ=πk ðÞ ρcV=2k ðÞ, x0¼x0 2k=ρcV ðÞy0¼y0 2k=ρcV ðÞandz0¼z0 2k=ρcV ðÞ:ð10:2Þ In these equations, T0is the initial temperature, and ρ,c, and kare density, speciﬁc heat, and thermal conductivity of the substrate, respectively. In this simpliﬁed model, the thermophysical properties are assumed to be temperature independent, Fig. 10.14 3D Rosenthal geometry considered262 10 Directed Energy Deposition Processesand are often selected at the melting temperature, since cooling rate and thermal gradient at the solid/liquid interface is of greatest interest.

For microstructure prediction purposes, solidiﬁcation characteristics are of interest; and thus we need to know the cooling rate and thermal gradients at the boundary of the melt pool. The roots of ( 10.1) can be solved numerically for temperature Tequal to melting temperature Tmto ﬁnd the dimensions of the melt pool.

After this derivation, Bontha et al. [ 6] used this analytical model to demonstrate the difference between solidiﬁcation microstructures which can be achieved using a small scale DED process with a lower-powered laser beam, suchas utilized in a LENS machine, compared to a high-powered laser beam system,such as practiced by AeroMet for Ti–6Al–4 V. Assumptions included thethermophysical properties of Ti–6Al–4 V at T m¼1,654/C14C, a room temperature initial substrate temperature T0¼25/C14C, fraction of energy absorbed α¼35, laser power from 350 to 850 W, and beam velocity ranging from 2.12 to 10.6 mm/s. Forthe high-powered beam system, a laser power range from 5 to 30 kW was selected. A set of graphs representing microstructures with low-powered systems is shown in Fig.10.15 . Microstructures from high-powered systems are shown in Fig. 10.16 for comparison. As can be seen from Fig. 10.15 , lower-powered DED systems cannot create mixed or equiaxed Ti–6Al–4 V microstructures, as the lower overall heat input264 10 Directed Energy Deposition ProcessesFig. 10.15 Process maps showing microstructures predicted by the 3D Rosenthal solution for a lower-powered (LENS-like) directed energy deposition system for Ti–6Al–4V (MATERIALSSCIENCE & ENGINEERING.

For higher-powered DED systems (relevant to AeroMet-like processes and most electron beam DED pro-cess), it is possible to create dendritic, mixed or fully equiaxed microstructures depending upon the process parameter combinations used. As a result, without the need for extensive experimentation, process maps such as these, when combinedwith appropriate modeling, can be used to predict the type of DED system (speciﬁ-cally the scan rates and laser power) needed to achieve a desired microstructuretype for a particular alloy. 10.8 DED Benefits and Drawbacks DED processes are capable of producing fully dense parts with highly controllablemicrostructural features. These processes can produce functionally gradedcomponents with composition variations in the X,Y, and Zdirections. The main limitations of DED processes are poor resolution and surface ﬁnish. An accuracy better than 0.25 mm and a surface roughness of less than 25 μm (arithmetic average) are difﬁcult with most DED processes. Slower build speed isanother limitation. Build times can be very long for these processes, with typical deposition rates as low as 25–40 g/h. To achieve better accuracies, small beam sizes and deposition rates are required. Conversely, to achieve rapid deposition rates,degradation of resolution and surface ﬁnish result. Changes in laser power and scanrate to achieve better accuracies or deposition rates may also affect themicrostructures of the deposited components, and thus ﬁnding an optimum deposi-tion condition necessitates tradeoffs between build speed, accuracy, andmicrostructure. Examples of the unique capabilities of DED include:  DED offers the capability for unparalleled control of microstructure. The ability to change material composition and solidiﬁcation rate by simply changingpowder feeder mixtures and process parameters gives designers and researcherstremendous freedom. This design freedom is further explored in Chap. 17.  DED is capable of producing directionally solidiﬁed and single crystal structures.  DED can be utilized for effectively repairing and refurbishing defective and service damaged high-technology components such as turbine blades.  DED processes are capable of producing in-situ generated composite and het- erogeneous material parts. For example, Banerjee et al. [ 7] have successfully produced Ti–6Al–4V/TiB composite parts using the LENS process employing ablend of pure prealloyed Ti–6Al–4 V and elemental B powders (98 wt% Ti–6Al–4V + 2 wt% B). The deposited material exhibited a homogeneous reﬁneddispersion of nanoscale TiB precipitates within the Ti–6Al–4V α/βmatrix.  DED can be used to deposit thin layers of dense, corrosion resistant, and wear resistant metals on components to improve their performance and lifetime. One266 10 Directed Energy Deposition Processesexample includes deposition of dense Ti/TiC coatings as bearing surfaces on Ti biomedical implants, as illustrated in Fig. 10.2. When contrasted with other AM processes, DED processes cannot produce as complex of structures as powder bed fusion processes. This is due to the need formore dense support structures (or multiaxis deposition) for complex geometries andthe fact that the larger melt pools in DED result in a reduced ability to producesmall-scale features, greater surface roughness, and less accuracy. Post-processing of parts made using DED typically involves removal of support structures or the substrate, if the substrate is not intended to be a part of the ﬁnalcomponent. Finish machining operations because of relatively poor part accuracy and surface ﬁnish are commonly needed. Stress relief heat treatment may be required to relieve residual stresses. In addition, depending upon the material,heat treatment may be necessary to produce the desired microstructure(s). Forinstance, parts constructed in age-hardenable materials will require either a directaging treatment or solution treatment followed by an aging treatment to achieveprecipitation of strengthening phases. DED processes are uniquely suited among AM process for repair and feature addition. As this AM process is formulated around deposition, there is no need to deposit on a featureless plate or substrate. Instead, DED is often most successful when used to add value to other components by repairing features, adding newfeatures to an existing component and/or coating a component with material whichis optimized for the service conditions of that component in a particular location. As a result of the combined strengths of DED processes, practitioners of DED primarily fall into one of several categories. First, DED has been highly utilized byresearch organizations interested in the development of new material alloys and theapplication of new or advanced materials to new industries. Second, DED has found great success in facilities that focus on repair, overhaul, and modernization of metallic structures. Third, DED is useful for adding features and/or material toexisting structures to improve their performance characteristics. In this third cate-gory, DED can be used to improve the life of injection molding or die casting diesby depositing wear-resistant alloys in high-wear locations; it is being activelyresearched by multiple biomedical companies for improving the characteristics ofbiomedical implants; and it is used to extend the wear characteristics of everythingfrom drive shafts to motorcycle engine components. Fourth, DED is increasingly used to produce near net structures in place of wrought billets, particularly for applications where conventional manufacturing results in a large buy-to-ﬂy ratio. 10.9 Exercises Discuss three characteristics where DED is similar to extrusion-based processes and three characteristics where DED is different than extrusion-based processes.10.9 Exercises 2672.

Although directed energy deposition, material jetting, material extrusion, and other AM processes ﬁt this deﬁnition; for the purposes of distinguishing betweenthe technologies discussed in this chapter and the technologies discussed elsewherein this book, we will limit our deﬁnition of DW to those technologies which aredesigned to build freeform structures or electronics with feature resolution in one ormore dimensions below 50 μm. This “small-scale” interpretation is how the term direct write is typically understood in the additive manufacturing community. Thus, for the purposes of this chapter, DW technologies are those processes which create meso-, micro-, and nanoscale structures using a freeform deposition tool. Although freeform surface modiﬁcation using lasers and other treatments in some cases can be referred to as direct write [ 2] we will only discuss those technologies which add material to a surface. A more complete treatment of directwrite technologies can be found in books dedicated to this topic [ 3]. 11.2 Background Although the initial use of some DW technologies predate the advent of AM, the development of DW technologies was dramatically accelerated in the 1990s by funding from the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) andits Mesoscopic Integrated Conformal Electronics (MICE) program. DARPArecognized the potential for creating novel components and devices if materialdeposition technologies could be further developed to enable manufacture ofcomplex electronic circuitry and mesoscale devices onto or within ﬂexible orcomplex three-dimensional objects. Many different DW technologies were #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_11269developed or improved following funding from DARPA, including Matrix-Assisted Pulsed Laser Evaporation (MAPLE), nScrypt 3De, Maskless Mesoscale MaterialsDeposition (M 3D, now known as Aerosol Jet), and Direct Write Thermal Spraying. As a result, most people have come to consider DW technologies as those devices which are designed to write or print passive or active electronic components(conductors, insulators, batteries, capacitors, antennas, etc.) directly from a com-puter ﬁle without any tooling or masks. However, DW devices have found broadapplicability outside the direct production of circuitry and are now used to fabricatestructures with tailored thermal, electrical, chemical, and biological responses,among other applications. DW processes can be subdivided into ﬁve categories, including ink-based, laser transfer, thermal spray, beam deposition, liquid-phase, and beam tracing processes. Most of these use a 3D programmable dispensing or deposition head to accuratelyapply small amounts of material automatically to form circuitry or other usefuldevices on planar or complex geometries. The following sections of this chapterdescribe these basic approaches to DW processing and commercial examples,where appropriate. 11.3 Ink-Based DW The most varied, least expensive, and most simple approaches to DW involve theuse of liquid inks. These inks are deposited on a surface and contain the basic materials which become the desired structure. A signiﬁcant number of ink types are available, including, among others:  Colloidal inks  Nanoparticle-ﬁlled inks Fugitive organic inks Polyelectrolyte inks Sol–gel inks After deposition, these inks solidify due to evaporation, gelation, solvent-driven reactions, or thermal energy to leave a deposit of the desired properties. A largenumber of research organizations, corporations, and universities worldwide areinvolved in the development of new and improved DW inks. DW inks are typically either extruded as a continuous ﬁlament through a nozzle (see Chap. 6) or deposited as droplets using a printing head (see Chap. 7). Important rheological properties of DW inks include their ability to (1) ﬂow through the deposition apparatus, (2) retain shape after deposition, and (3) either span voids/ gaps or ﬁll voids/gaps, as the case may be. To build three-dimensional DWstructures it is highly desirable for the deposited inks to be able to form a predict-able and stable 3D deposition shape, and to bridge small gaps. For 2D electronicstructures built onto a surface, it is highly desirable for the deposited inks tomaintain a constant and controllable cross section, as this will determine the270 11 Direct Write Technologiesmaterial properties (e.g., conductivity, capacitance, etc.). In general, this means that viscoelastic materials which ﬂow freely under shear through a nozzle but become rigid and set up quickly after that shear stress is released are preferred for DW inks. DW inks must be transformed after deposition to achieve the desired properties. This transformation may be due to the natural environment surrounding the deposit (such as during evaporation or gelation) but in many cases external heating using a thermal source or some other post-processing step is required. Figure 11.1 illustrates the two most common methodologies for DW ink dis- pensing. Continuous dispensing, as in (a), has the merits of a continuous cross- sectional area and a wider range of ink rheologies. Droplet dispensing, as in (b), can be parallelized and done in a very rapid fashion; however, the deposit cross sections are discontinuous, as the building blocks are basically overlapping hemispherical droplet splats, and the rheological properties must be within a tighter range (as discussed in Sect. 7.4). Nozzle dispensing and quill processes both create continuous deposits from DW inks. Printing and aerosol jet processes both create droplets from DW inks. These four approaches are discussed in more detail below. 11.3.1 Nozzle Dispensing Processes Nozzle DW processes are technologies which use a pump or syringe mechanism to push DW inks through an oriﬁce for deposition onto a substrate. A three-axis motion control system is typically used with these nozzle systems to enable deposition onto complex surfaces or to build-up scaffolds or other 3D geometry, Fig. 11.1 Schematic illustration of direct ink writing techniques: ( a) continuous ﬁlament writing and ( b) droplet jetting [ 4] (courtesy nScrypt)11.3 Ink-Based DW 271as illustrated in Fig. 11.2. Some nozzle devices are packaged with a scanning system that ﬁrst determines the topology of the substrate on which the deposit is to be made, and then deposits material conformally over that substrate surface based on the scan data. For nozzle processes, the main differentiating factors between devices are the: (1) nozzle design, (2) motion control system, and (3) pump design. Nozzle design determines the size and shape of the deposit, directly inﬂuences the smallest feature size, and has a large effect on the types of inks which can be used (i.e., the viscosity of the ink and the size and type of ﬁllers which can be used in the inks). The motion controller determines the dimensional accuracy and repeatability of the deposit, the maximum size of the deposit which can be made, and the speed at which deposition can occur. The pump design determines the volumetric control and repeatability of dispensing, how accurately the deposits can be started and stopped, and the speed at which deposition can occur. The difference between these three factors for different manufacturers and designs determines the price and performance of a nozzle-based DW process. Micropen and nScrypt are two companies with well-developed extrusion nozzles and deposition systems for DW. Micropen stopped selling machines in 2008 and currently sells DW services and solutions. nScrypt markets and sells nozzles, pumps, and integrated scanning, dispensing and motion control systems for DW. A wide range of nozzle designs are available, and feedback systems help ensure that the stand-off distance between the nozzle and the substrate remains substantially constant to enable repeatable and accurate deposition of traces across conformal surfaces. One characteristic of nScrypt systems is their Smart Pump ™design, which has 20 pL control of deposition volume and has an aspirating function, causing the material to be pulled back into the print nozzle at the end of a deposition path. This aspiration function enables precise starts and stops. In addition, a conical nozzle design enables a large range of viscous materials to be dispensed. The pump and nozzle design, when combined, enable viscosities which are processable over six Fig. 11.2 A schematic drawing showing the deposition of a scaffold using a nozzle process [ 4] (courtesy nScrypt)272 11 Direct Write Technologiesorders of magnitude, from 1 to 1,000,000 cp (the equivalent of processing materials ranging from water to peanut butter). This means that virtually any electronic ink orpaste can be utilized. Materials ranging from electronic inks to quick setting concrete have been deposited using nScrypt systems. Simple DW nozzle devices can be built using off-the-shelf syringes, pumps, and three-axis motion controllers for a few thousand dollars, such as by using aninexpensive material extrusion systems such as the Fab@Home system developedat Cornell University [ 6]. These enable one to experiment with nozzle-based DW processes for a relatively low-capital investment. Fully integrated devices withmultiple nozzles capable of higher dimensional accuracy, dispensing repeatability,and wider range of material viscosities can cost signiﬁcantly more than $250,000. Nozzle DW processes have successfully been used to fabricate devices such as integrated RC ﬁlters, multilayer voltage transformers, resistor networks, porouschemical sensors, biological scaffolds, and other components. Three aspects ofnozzle-based processes make them interesting candidates for DW practitioners:(1) these processes can deposit ﬁne line traces on nonplanar substrates, (2) theywork with the largest variety of inks of any DW technology and (3) they can bebuilt-up from interchangeable low-cost components, and integrated easily ontovarious types of multiaxis motion control systems. The main drawback of nozzle- based systems is that the inks must typically be thermally post-processed to achieve the robust properties desired for most end-use applications. Thus, a thermal or laserpost-deposition-processing system is highly beneﬁcial. Although the types ofmaterials which have been deposited successfully using nozzle-based processesare too numerous to list, examples include [ 5]:  Electronic Materials—metal powders (silver, copper, gold, etc.) or ceramic powders (alumina, silica, etc.) suspended in a liquid precursor that after deposi- tion and thermal post-processing form resistors, conductors, antennas, dielectrics, etc.  Thermoset Materials—adhesives, epoxies, etc. for encapsulation, insulation, adhesion, etc.  Solders—lead-free, leaded, etc. as electrical connections. Biological Materials—synthetic polymers and natural polymers, including liv- ing cells.  Nanomaterials—nanoparticles suspended in gels, slurries, etc. 11.3.2 Quill-Type Processes DW inks can be deposited using a quill-type device, much like a quill pen can beused to deposit writing ink on a piece of paper. These processes work by dipping thepen into a container of ink. The ink adheres to the surface of the pen and then, whenthe pen is put near the substrate, the ink is transferred from the pen to the substrate.By controlling the pen motion, an accurate pattern can be produced. The primaryDW method for doing this is the dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) technique11.3 Ink-Based DW 273developed by a number of universities and sold by Nanoink, Inc. This process works by dipping an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip into an inkwell ofspecially formulated DW ink. The ink adheres to the AFM tip, and then is used to write a pattern onto a substrate, as illustrated in Fig. 11.3a . Nanoink-ceased operations in 2013, but a number of organizations continue to use DPN fornanoscale DW research and development. DPN is capable of producing 14 nm line widths with 5 nm spatial resolution. It is typically used to produce features on ﬂat surfaces (although uneven topography atthe nm scale is unavoidable even on the so-called ﬂat surfaces). Various 1D and 2Darrays of pen tips are available, with some 1D 8-pen designs capable of individualtip actuation (either “on” or “off” with respect to each other by lifting individual AFM tips using a thermal bimorph approach) so that not all print heads produce the deposition pattern being traced by the motion controller or so that unused pens canbe used for AFM scanning. The scalability of DPN was demonstrated using the Fig. 11.3 (a) A schematic showing how an AFM tip is used to write a pattern on a substrate. ( b) An illustration of a 2D array of print heads(55,000 per cm 2)[7] (courtesy NanoInk)274 11 Direct Write TechnologiesPrintArray ™, which had 55,000 AFM quills in a square centimeter, enabling 55,000 identical patterns to be made at one time. This array, however, did notenable individual tip actuation. One use of DPN is the placement of DNA molecules in speciﬁc patterns. DNA is inherently viscous, so the pens used for these materials must be stiffer than for mostnano inks. Also, unique inkwell arrays have been developed to enable multiple tipsto be charged with the same ink, or different inks for different tips. When combin-ing a multimaterial inkwell with an actuated pen array, multimaterial nanoscalefeatures can be produced. Based on the physics of adhesion to AFM tips at verysmall length scales, most inks developed for other DW processes cannot be usedwith DPN. 11.3.3 Inkjet Printing Processes Hundreds, if not thousands, of organizations around the world practice the deposi-tion of DW precursor inks using inkjet printing [ 3,8]. This is primarily done to form complex electronic circuitry on ﬂat surfaces, as deposition onto a conformal substrate is difﬁcult. The inkjet printing approach to DW fabrication is comparable to the direct printing class of additive manufacturing technologies discussed inChap. 7. In the case of DW, the print heads and motion control systems are optimized for printing high-accuracy electronic traces from DW inks onto rela-tively ﬂat substrates in one or just a few layers rather than the build-up of three-dimensional objects from low-melting-point polymers or photopolymers. The primary beneﬁts of inkjet approaches to direct write are their speed and low cost. Parallel sets of inkjet print heads can be used to very rapidly deposit DW inks. By setting up arrays of print heads, very large areas can be printed rapidly. In addition, there are numerous suppliers for inkjet print heads. The primary drawbacks of inkjet approaches to direct write are the difﬁculty inherent with printing on conformal surfaces, the use of droplets as building blockswhich can affect material continuity, more stringent requirements on ink rheology,and a limited droplet size range. Since inkjet print heads deposit material in adroplet-by-droplet manner, the fundamental building block is hemispherical (seeFig. 11.1b ). In order to produce consistent conductive paths, for instance, the droplets need a repeatable degree of overlap. This overlap is relatively easy to control between droplets that are aligned with the print head motion, but fordeposits that are at an angle with respect to the print head motion there will be aclassic “stair-step” effect, resulting in a change in cross-sectional area at locationsin the deposit. This can be overcome by using only a single droplet print head andcontrolling its motion so that it follows the desired traces (similar to the Solidscapeapproach to material jetting). It can also be overcome using a material removalsystem (such as a laser) to trim the deposits after their deposition to a highly accurate, repeatable cross section, giving consistent conductivity, resistivity, or other properties throughout the deposit. However, these solutions to stair stepping11.3 Ink-Based DW 275mean that one cannot take advantage of the parallel nature of inkjet printing, or a more complicated apparatus is needed. Most inkjet print heads work best with inks of low viscosity at or near room temperature. However, the rheological properties (primarily viscosity) which are needed to print a DW ink can often only be achieved when printing is done at elevated temperatures. The modeling introduced in Chap. 7is useful for determin- ing the material types which can be considered for inkjet DW. 11.3.4 Aerosol DW Aerosol DW processes make deposits from inks or ink-like materials suspended as an aerosol mist. The commercialized version of this approach is the Aerosol Jet process developed by Optomec. The Aerosol Jet process begins with atomization of a liquid molecular precursor or a colloidal suspension of materials, which can include metal, dielectric, ferrite, resistor, or biological materials. The aerosol stream is delivered to a deposition head using a carrier gas. The stream is surrounded by a coaxial sheath air ﬂow, and exits the chamber through an oriﬁce directed at the substrate. This coaxial ﬂow focuses the aerosol stream onto the substrate and allows for deposition of features with dimensions as small as 5 μm. Typically either laser chemical decomposition or thermal treatment is used to process the deposit to the desired state. The Aerosol Jet process can be controlled to be gentle enough to deposit living cells. A schematic illustration of the Aerosol Jet process is shown in Fig. 11.4. The Aerosol Jet process was initially conceived as a process which made use of the physics of laser guidance. When photons of light interact with free-ﬂoating or suspended small particles there is a slight amount of “force” applied to these particles, and these particles move in the direction of photon motion. When applied to aerosol DW, a laser is transmitted through the mist into a hollow ﬁber optic. The laser propels tiny droplets from the mist into and through the hollow ﬁber, deposit- ing the droplets onto a substrate where the ﬁber ends [ 9]. Laser guidance, however, entrains and moves droplets slowly and inefﬁciently. To overcome this drawback, Fig. 11.4 Aerosol Jet System. (1) Liquid material is placed into an atomizer, creating a dense aerosol of tiny droplets 1–5 μm in size. (2) The aerosol is carried by a gas ﬂow to the deposition head (with optional in-ﬂight laser processing). (3) Within the deposition head, the aerosol is focused by a second gas ﬂow and the resulting high-velocity stream is jetted onto the substrate creating features as small as 10 μm in size (Courtesy of Optomec)276 11 Direct Write Technologiesfurther iterations with the technology involved pressurizing the atomizer and using a pressure drop and ﬂow of gas through the tube between the atomizer and thedeposition head as the primary means of droplet propulsion. Lasers can still beused, however, to provide in-ﬂight energy to the droplets, or to modify themthermally or chemically. The ability to laser-process the aerosol droplets in-ﬂight and/or on the substrate enables the deposition of a wider variety of materials, as both untreated and coaxially laser-treated materials can be considered. One beneﬁt of a collimated aerosol spraying process is its high stand-off distance and large working distance. The nozzle can be between 1 and 5 mm from thesubstrate with little variation in deposit shape and size within that range. Thismeans that repeatable deposits are possible on substrates which have steps orother geometrical features on their surface. A major application for Aerosol Jet iscreating interconnects for solar panels; which makes use of its unique ability to deposit conductive traces on a substrate with widely varying stand-off distances. The Aerosol Jet process is also more ﬂexible than inkjet printing processes, as it can process a wide range of material viscosities (0.7–2,500 cPs), it has variable linewidths from 5 to 5,000 μm, and layer thicknesses between 0.025 and 10 μm. The main drawback of the Aerosol Jet process is its complexity compared to otherink-based processes. The Aerosol Jet process has been parallelized to include largenumbers of printheads in an array, so the process can be made quite fast andﬂexible, in spite of its complexity. Table 11.1 summarizes the key beneﬁts and drawbacks of ink-based approaches to DW. 11.4 Laser Transfer DW When a focused high-energy laser beam is absorbed by a material, that materialmay be heated, melted, ablated, or some combination thereof. In the case ofablation, there is direct evaporation (or transformation to plasma) of material.Table 11.1 Key benefits and drawbacks of ink-based approaches to DW ManufacturerNozzle Quill Inkjet printing Aerosol nScrypt Nanoink Various Optomec Key beneﬁts Greatest range of viscosities,simplicity, capable of 3D lattice structuresNanoscale structures, massiveparallelization is possibleSpeed due to parallelizationof print heads, numerous manufacturersWidest range of workingdistances and line widths, coaxial lasertreatment Key drawbacksKnowledge of surface topography needed tomaintain constantstand-off distanceOnly relevant at very small length scales, requires precise motioncontrollers andcustom inksNeed ﬂat plates or low-curvature substrates,limited inkviscosity rangesComplex apparatus. Requires inks which can beaerosolized11.4 Laser Transfer DW 277During ablation, a gas or plasma is formed, which expands rapidly as further laser energy is added. This rapid expansion can create a shock wave within a material or it can propel a material. By focusing the expansion of the material during ablation (utilizing shock waves produced by laser ablation) or taking advantage of rapid thermal expansion inherent with laser heating, materials can be accurately trans- ferred in a very repeatable and accurate manner from one location to another. Laser transfer DW makes use of these phenomena by transferring material from a foil, tape, or plate onto a substrate. By carefully controlling the energy and location of the impinging laser, complex patterns of transferred material can be formed on a substrate. Two different mechanisms for laser transfer are illustrated in Fig. 11.5. Figure 11.5a illustrates a laser transfer process where a transparent carrier (a foil or plate donor substrate which is transparent to the laser wavelength) is coated with a sacriﬁcial transfer material and the dynamic release layer (the build material). The impinging laser energy ablates the transfer material (forming a plasma or gas), which propels the build material towards the substrate. The material impacts the substrate and adheres, forming a coating on the substrate. When using a pulsed laser, a precise amount of material can be deposited per pulse. Figure 11.5b shows a slightly different mechanism for material transfer. In this case the laser pulse ablates a portion of the surface of a foil. This ablation and absorption of thermal energy creates thermal waves and shock waves in the material. These waves are transmitted through the material and cause a portion of the material on the opposing side to fracture from the surface in a brittle manner (known as spallation). The fractured material is propelled towards the substrate, forming a deposit coating on the substrate (not shown). The Matrix-Assisted Pulsed Laser Evaporation Direct Write (MAPLE-DW) process was developed to make use of these laser transfer phenomena [ 12]. A schematic of the MAPLE-DW process is shown in Fig. 11.6. In this process, a laser transparent quartz disc or polymer tape is coated on one side with a ﬁlm (a few Fig. 11.5 (a) Mechanism for laser transfer using a sacriﬁcial transfer material (based on [ 10]). (b) Mechanism for laser transfer using thermal shock and spallation (based on [ 11]) (courtesy Douglas B. Chrisey)278 11 Direct Write Technologiesmicrons thick), which consists of a powdered material that is to be deposited and a polymer binder. The coated disc or tape is placed in close proximity and parallel to the substrate. A laser is focused onto the coated ﬁlm. When a laser pulse strikes the coating, the polymer is evaporated and the powdered material is deposited on the substrate, ﬁrmly adhering to it. By appropriate control of the positions of both the ribbon and the substrate, complex patterns can be deposited. By changing the type of ribbon, multimaterial structures can be produced. Laser transfer processes have been used to create deposits of a wide variety of materials, including metals, ceramics, polymers, and even living tissues. The main drawbacks of a laser transfer process are the need to form a tape with the appropri- ate transfer and/or deposit materials, and the fact that the unused portions of the tape are typically wasted. The beneﬁts of the laser transfer process are that it produces a highly repeatable deposit (the deposit is quantized based on the laser pulse energy), it can be as accurate as the laser scanners used to manipulate the laser beam, and the deposited materials may not need any further post-processing. In addition, the laser can be used to either simply propel the material onto the substrate without thermally affecting the substrate or it can be used to laser treat the deposit (including heating, cutting, etc.) to modify the properties or geometry of the deposit during or after deposition. In the case of a rigid tape (such as when using a glass plate) the plate is typically mechanically suspended above the substrate. When a ﬂexible polymer Fig. 11.6 Matrix-Assisted Pulsed Laser Evaporation Direct Write (MAPLE-DW) process [ 13] (Courtesy PennWell Corp., Laser Focus World)11.4 Laser Transfer DW 279tape is used, it can be laid directly onto the substrate before laser processing and then peeled from the substrate after laser processing, leaving behind the desired pattern. 11.5 Thermal Spray DW Thermal spray is a process that accelerates material to high velocities and deposits them on a substrate, as shown in Fig. 11.7. Material is introduced into a combustion or plasma ﬂame (plume) in powder or wire form. The plume melts and imparts thermal and kinetic energy to the material, creating high-velocity droplets. By controlling the plume characteristics and material state (e.g., molten or softened) it is possible to deposit a wide range of metals, ceramics, polymers, or composites thereof. Particles can be deposited in a solid or semisolid state, which enables the creation of useful deposits at or near room temperature. Thermal spray techniques for DW have been commercialized by MesoScribe Technologies, Inc. [ 14]. A deposit is built-up by successive impingement of droplets, which yield ﬂattened, solidiﬁed platelets, referred to as splats. The deposit microstructure, and thus its properties, strongly depends on the processing parameters utilized. Key characteristics of thermal spray DW include: (1) a high volumetric deposition rate, (2) material ﬂexibility, (3) useful material properties in the as-deposited state (without thermal treatment or curing), and (4) moderate thermal input during processing, allowing for deposition on a variety of substrates. Fig. 11.7 General apparatus for thermal spray [ 15] (Courtesy of and (C) Copyright Sulzer Metco. All rights reserved)280 11 Direct Write TechnologiesDW thermal spray differs from traditional thermal spray in that the size and shape of the deposit is controlled by a unique aperture system. A schematic aperture system from an issued patent is shown in Fig. 11.8. This aperture is made up of adjustable, moving metal foils (702a and 702b moving horizontally and 708a and708b moving vertically) which constrain the plume to desired dimensions (region720). The distance between the moving foils determines the amount of spray whichreaches the substrate. The foils are in constant motion to avoid overheating andbuild-up of the material being sprayed. The used foils become a waste product ofthe system. Because the temperature of the substrate is kept low and no post-treatment is typically required, DW thermal spray is well-suited to produce multilayer devicesformed from different materials. It is possible to create insulating layers, conduc-tive/electronic layers, and further insulating layers stacked one on top of the other(including vias for signal transmission between layers) by changing betweenvarious metal, ceramic, and polymer materials. DW thermal spray has been usedto successfully fabricate thermocouples, strain gages, antennas, and other devicesfor harsh environments directly from precursor metal and ceramic powders. In addition, DW thermal spray, combined with ultrafast laser micromachining, has been shown to be capable of fabricating thermopiles for power generation [ 16]. Fig. 11.8 Schematic aperture apparatus for direct write thermal spray (US patent 6576861). Foils 702a, b and 708a, b are in constant motion and are adjusted to allow different amounts of spray toreach the substrate through hole 720 in the center11.5 Thermal Spray DW 28111.6 Beam Deposition DW Several direct write procedures have been developed based upon vapor deposition technologies using, primarily, thermal decomposition of precursor gases. Vapordeposition technologies produce solid material by condensation, chemical reaction, or conversion of material from a vapor state. In the case of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), thermal energy is utilized to convert a reactant gas to a solidat a substrate. In the regions where a heat source has raised the temperature above acertain threshold, solid material is formed from the surrounding gaseous precursorreactants. The chemical composition and properties of the deposit are related to thethermal history during material deposition. By moving a localized heat sourceacross a substrate (such as by scanning a laser) a complex geometry can be formed.A large number of research groups over almost 20 years have investigated the use of vapor deposition technologies for additive manufacturing purposes [ 17]. A few examples of these technologies are described below. 11.6.1 Laser CVD Laser Chemical Vapor Deposition (LCVD) is a DW process which uses heat from alaser to selectively transform gaseous reactants into solid materials. In somesystems, multiple gases can be fed into a small reactant chamber at differenttimes to form multimaterial structures, or mixtures of gases with varying concentrations can be used to form gradient structures. Sometimes ﬂowing jets of gas are used to create a localized gaseous atmosphere, rather than ﬁlling a chamberwith the gaseous precursor materials. The resolution of an LCVD deposit is related to the laser beam diameter, energy density, and wavelength (which directly impact the size of the heated zone on thesubstrate) as well as substrate thermal properties. Depending on the gases present atthe heated reactive zone, many different metals and ceramics can be deposited,including composites. LCVD has been used to deposit carbon ﬁbers and multilay- ered carbon structures in addition to numerous types of metal and ceramic structures. A LCVD system developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology is displayed in Fig. 11.9. This design constrains the reactant gas (which is often highly corrosive, and/or biologically harmful) to a small chamber that is separated from the motioncontrollers and other mechanisms. This small, separated reaction chamber hasmultiple beneﬁts, including an ability to quickly change between reagent gasmaterials for multimaterial deposition, and better protection of the hardware from corrosion. By monitoring the thermal and dimensional characteristics of the deposit, process parameters can be controlled to create deposits of desired geometryand material properties. LCVD systems are capable of depositing many types of materials, including carbon, silicon carbide, boron, boron nitride, and molybdenum onto varioussubstrates including graphite, grafoil, zirconia, alumina, tungsten, and silicon282 11 Direct Write Technologies[18]. Direct write patterns as well as ﬁbers have been successfully deposited. A wide variety of materials and deposit geometries make LCVD a viable technology for further direct write developments. LCVD is most comparable to microthermal spray, in that deposits of metals and ceramics are directly formed without post- treatment, but without the “splat” geometry inherent in thermal spray. The beneﬁts of LCVD are the unique materials and geometries it can deposit. However, LCVD has a very low deposition rate and a relatively high system complexity and cost compared to most DW approaches (particularly ink-based technologies). High- temperature deposition can be another disadvantage of the process. In addition, the need to deposit on surfaces that are contained within a controlled-atmosphere chamber limits its ability to make deposits on larger preexisting structures. LCVD can be combined with layer-wise deposition of powders (similar to the binder jetting techniques in Chap. 8) to more rapidly fabricate structures than when using LCVD alone. In this case the solid material created from the vapor phase is used to bind the powdered material together in regions where the laser has heated the powder bed. This process is known as Selective Area Laser Deposition Vapor Inﬁltration (SALDVI). In SALDVI, the build-rates are much higher than when the entire structure is fabricated from LCVD-deposited materials only; but the resultant Fig. 11.9 The LCVD system developed at Georgia Tech11.6 Beam Deposition DW 283structures may be porous and are composite in nature. The build-rate difference between LCVD and SALDVI is analogous to the difference between binder jettingand material jetting. 11.6.2 Focused Ion Beam CVD A focused ion beam (FIB) is a beam of ionized gallium atoms created when agallium metal source is placed in contact with a tungsten needle and heated. Liquidgallium wets the needle, and the imposition of a strong electric ﬁeld causes ionization and emission of gallium atoms. These ions are accelerated and focused in a small stream (with a spot size as low as a few nanometers) using electrostaticlenses. A FIB is similar in conceptualization to an electron beam source, and thusFIB is often combined with electron beams, such as in a dual-beam FIB-scanningelectron microscope system. FIB processing, when done by itself, can be destructive, as high-energy gallium ions striking a substrate will cause sputtering and removal of atoms. This enablesFIB to be used as a nanomachining tool. However, due to sputtering effects and implantation of gallium atoms, surfaces near the machining zone will be changed by deposition of the removed material and ion implantation. This sputtering and ionimplantation, if properly controlled, can also be a beneﬁt for certain applications. Direct write deposition using FIB is possible in a manner similar to LCVD. By scanning the FIB source over a substrate in the presence of CVD gaseousprecursors, solid materials are deposited onto the substrate (and/or implanted withinthe surface of the substrate) [ 19,20]. These deposits can be submicron in size and feature resolution. FIB CVD for DW has been used to produce combinations of metallic and dielectric materials to create three-dimensional structures and cir- cuitry. In addition, FIB CVD is being used in the integrated circuits (IC) industryto repair faulty circuitry. Both the machining and deposition features of FIB areused for IC repairs. In the case of short-circuits, excess material can be removedusing a FIB. In the case of improperly formed electrical contacts, FIB CVD can beused to draw conductive traces to connect electrical circuitry. 11.6.3 Electron Beam CVD Electron beams can be used to induce CVD in a manner similar to FIB CVD andLCVD. Electron beam CVD is slower than laser or FIB CVD; however, FIB CVDand electron beam CVD both have a better resolution than LCVD [ 21].284 11 Direct Write Technologies11.7 Liquid-Phase Direct Deposition Similarly to the vapor techniques described above, thermal or electrical energy can be used to convert liquid-phase materials into solid materials. These thermochemi- cal and electrochemical techniques can be applied in a localized manner to create prescribed patterns of solid material. Drexel University illustrated the use of thermochemical means for DW traces using ThermoChemical Liquid Deposition (TCLD). In TCLD, liquid reactants are sprayed through a nozzle onto a hot substrate. The reactants thermally decompose or react with one another on the hot surface to form a solid deposit on the substrate. By controlling the motion of the nozzle and the spraying parameters, a 3D shape of deposited material can be formed. This is conceptually similar to the ink-based DW approaches discussed above, but requires a high-temperature substrate during deposition. A second Electrochemical Liquid Deposition (ECLD) approach was also tested at Drexel. In ECLD, a conductive substrate is submerged in a plating bath and connected to a DC power source as the cathode, as in Fig. 11.10 . A pin made up of the material to be deposited is used as the anode. By submerging the pin in the bath near the substrate and applying an appropriate voltage and current, electrochemical decomposition and ion transfer results in a deposit of the pin material onto the substrate. By moving the pin, a prescribed geometry can be traced. As electrochem- ical plating is a slow process, the volumetric rate of deposition for ELCD can be increased by putting a thin layer of metal powder in the plating bath on the surface of the substrate (similar conceptually to SALDVI described above). In this case, the Fig. 11.10 Schematic of an electrochemical liquid deposition system [ 22] (MATERIALS & DESIGN by Zongyan He, Jack G. Zhou and Ampere A. Tseng. Copyright 2000 by Elsevier Science & Technology Journals. Reproduced with permission of Elsevier Science & Technology Journals in the format Textbook via Copyright Clearance Center.)11.7 Liquid-Phase Direct Deposition 285deposited material acts as a binder for the powdered materials, and the volumetric rate of deposition is signiﬁcantly increased [ 22]. Thermochemical and electrochemical techniques can be used to produce complex-geometry solids at small length scales from any metal compatible with thermochemical or electrochemical deposition, respectively. These processes arealso compatible with some ceramics. However, these approaches are not availablecommercially and may have few beneﬁts over the other DW techniques describedabove. Drawbacks of TCLD-based approaches are the need for a heated substrateand the use of chemical precursors which may be toxic or corrosive. Drawbacks ofECLD-based approaches include the slow deposition rate of electrochemical pro-cesses and the fact that, when used as a binder for powders, the resultant product is porous and requires further processing (such as sintering or inﬁltration) to achieve desirable properties. 11.8 Beam Tracing Approaches to Additive/Subtractive DW By combining layer-wise additive approaches with freeform beam (electron, FIB,or laser) subtractive approaches, it is possible to create DW features. Many coatingtechniques exist to add a thin layer of material to a substrate. These include physicalvapor deposition, electrochemical or thermochemical deposition, CVD, and otherthin ﬁlm techniques used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. Once these layersare added across the surface of a substrate, a beam can be used to trim each layerinto the prescribed cross-sectional geometry. These micro- or nanodiameter beamsare used to selectively cure or remove materials deposited in a layer-by-layer fashion. This approach is conceptually similar to the bond-then-form sheet lamina- tion techniques discussed in Chap. 9. 11.8.1 Electron Beam Tracing Electron beams can be used to either cure or remove materials for DW. Standard spin-on deposition coating equipment can be used to produce thin ﬁlms between30 and 80 nm. These ﬁlms are then exposed to a prescribed pattern using an electronbeam. Following exposure, the uncured material is removed using standardIC-fabrication techniques. This methodology can produce line-edge deﬁnitiondown to 3.3 nm. A converse approach can also be used, whereby the exposed material is removed and the unexposed material remains behind. In the case of curing, low-energy electrons can be utilized (and are often considered more desir-able, to reduce the occurrence of secondary electron scattering). These techniquesﬁt well within existing IC-fabrication methodologies and enable maskless ICfabrication. Another variant of electron beam tracing is to produce a thin layer of the desired material using physical vapor deposition or a similar approach and then to use high-286 11 Direct Write Technologiespowered electron beams to remove portions of the coating to form the desired pattern. Electron beams are not particularly efﬁcient for either curing or removing layers of material, however. Thus, electron beam tracing techniques for DW are quite slow. 11.8.2 Focused Ion Beam Tracing As discussed above, a FIB can be utilized to machine materials in a prescribedpattern. By combining the steps of layer-wise deposition with FIB machining, amultilayer structure can be formed. If the deposited material is changed layer-by- layer, then a multimaterial or gradient structure can be formed. 11.8.3 Laser Beam Tracing Short-wavelength lasers can be utilized to either cure layers of deposited materials or ablatively remove materials to form micro and nanoscale DW features. Toovercome the diffraction limit of traditional focusing optics, a number ofnanopatterning techniques have been developed to create features that are smaller than half the optical wavelength of the laser [ 23]. These techniques include multiphoton absorption, near-ﬁeld effects, and Bessel beam optical traps. Althoughthese techniques can be used to cure features at the nano scale, inherent problemswith alignment and positioning at these length scales make it difﬁcult to performsubwavelength nanopatterning in practice. These laser approaches are conceptually identical to the electron beam and FIB-based additive plus subtractive approaches just mentioned. Some of thebeneﬁts of lasers for beam tracing DW are that they can process materials much more rapidly than electron beams, and they can do so without introducing FIB gallium ions. The main drawback of lasers is their relatively large spot sizecompared to electron and FIBs. 11.9 Hybrid Technologies As in most additive manufacturing techniques, there is an inherent trade-offbetween material deposition speed and accuracy for most DW processes. This will remain true until techniques are developed for line-wise or layer-wise deposi- tion (such as is done with mask projection stereolithography using a DLP system, asdescribed in Chap. 4). Thus, to achieve a good combination of deposition speed and accuracy, hybrid technologies are often necessary. Some examples of hybridtechnologies have already been mentioned. These include the additive/subtractivebeam tracing methods described above and the use of a laser in the Aerosol Jetaerosol system.11.9 Hybrid Technologies 287The primary form of hybrid technology used in DW is to form deposits quickly and inexpensively using an ink-based technique and then trim those deposits using ashort-wavelength laser. This results in a good combination of build speed, accuracy, and overall cost for a wide variety of materials. In addition, the laser used to trim the ink-based deposits has the added beneﬁt of being an energy source for curing thedeposited inks, when used in a lower power or more diffuse manner. If DW isintegrated with an AM process that includes a laser, such as stereolithography, thelaser can be used to modify the DW traces [ 24]. One of the fastest hybrid DW approaches is the “roll-to-roll” approach. As the name suggests, roll-to-roll printing is analogous to high-speed 2D printing. In roll-to-roll DW, a paper or plastic sheet of material is used as a substrate material and moved through printing rolls that deposit patterns of DW ink that are subsequently thermally processed, such as with a ﬂash lamp. Inkjet printing and other DWtechniques can be added into the roll-to-roll facility to add ink patterns in a moreﬂexible manner than the repeated patterns printed by a printing roll. When DWtechniques and ﬂexible laser systems are integrated into a roll-to-roll facility, thisgives the combination of the speed of line-wise AM via the rolls plus the ﬂexibilityof point-wise AM via another DW technique. 11.10 Applications of Direct Write Technologies The applications of DW processes are growing rapidly [ 25]. There is a growing variety of materials which are available, including semiconductors, dielectric polymers, conductive metals, resistive materials, piezoelectrics, battery elements,capacitors, biological materials, and others. These can be deposited onto varioussubstrate materials including plastic, metal, ceramic, glass, and even cloth. Thecombination of these types of materials and substrates means that the applicationsfor DW are extremely broad. The most often cited applications for DW techniques are related to the fabrica- tion of sensors. DW approaches have been used to fabricate thermocouples, thermistors, magnetic ﬂux sensors, strain gages, capacitive gages, crack detection sensors, accelerometers, pressure gages, and more [ 3,14,16,26]. A second area of substantial interest is in antenna fabrication. Since DW, like other AM techniques, enables fabrication of complex geometries directly fromCAD data, antenna designs of arbitrary complexity can be made on the surface offreeform objects; including, for instance, fractal antennas on conformal surfaces.Figure 11.11 illustrates the fabrication of a fractal antenna on the abdomen of a worker honeybee using MAPLE-DW. Another area of interest for DW is as a freeform tool to connect combinations of electronic components on freeform surfaces. One area where this is particularlyuseful is in harsh environments, as shown in Fig. 11.12 . In this example, direct write thermal spray is used as a method for producing and connecting a series ofelectronic components that monitor and feed back information about the state ofa turbine blade. A thermocouple, labeled High-Temperature Sensor in the ﬁgure, is288 11 Direct Write Technologiesdeposited on the hot region of the blade, whereas the supporting electronics are deposited on the cold regions of the blade. DW-produced conductors are used to transmit signals between regions and components. Although most DW processes can produce thermal and strain sensors, there is still opportunity for improved conductors, insulators, antennas, batteries, capacitors, resistors, and other electronic circuitry. In addition, in every case where a conductive path is not possible between a power source and a deposited sensor, some form of local power generation is necessary. Several researchers have demonstrated the ability to create systems which use electromagnetic or thermopile power generation schemes using DW [ 16].

Chrisey) Fig. 11.12 A direct write sensor and associated wiring on a turbine blade structure. Signal conditioning electronics are positioned on a more shielded spot (Courtesy MesoScribe Technologies, Inc. and Arkansas Power Electronics Int.)11.10 Applications of Direct Write Technologies 289can be made robustly using DW, then the remote monitoring and sensing of components and parts is possible. For instance, the ability to create a thermal sensorwith integrated power harvesting and antenna directly onto an internally rotating component (such as a bearing) within a transmission could provide feedback to help optimize performance of systems from power plants to motor vehicles to jetengines. In addition, this type of remote sensing could notify the operator of thermalspikes before catastrophic system failure, thus saving time and money. DW techniques are rapidly growing. Ongoing investments in DW R&D indicate these technologies will continue to expand their application potential to becomecommon methods for creating nano-, micro-, and mesoscale features and devices. 11.10.1 Exercises From an internet search, identify two DW inks for conductive traces, one ink for resistors and one for dielectric traces, that are commonly used in nozzle-basedsystems. Make a table which lists their room-temperature properties and their primary beneﬁts and drawbacks. For the inks identiﬁed in problem 1, estimate the printing number (7.7). List all of your assumptions. Can any of the inks from problem 1 be used in an inkjetprinting system? Would you argue that DW techniques are a subset of AM technologies (like PBF or DED) or are they more an application of AM technologies? Why? Two techniques for accelerating DW were discussed in this chapter where DW deposition was used to bind powders to form an object. What other DW techniques might be accelerated by the use of a similar approach? How would you go about doing this? What type of machine architecture would you propose? Research thermocouple types that can withstand 1,000 /C14C. Based on the materials that are needed, which DW techniques could be used to make thesethermocouples and which could not?

Much of this is to do with the vast increase in the availability of the technology due to massivereductions in the technology costs. By making it possible for individuals toafford them for their own personal use, the true potential has been, to someextent, uncovered. This chapter will discuss some of the issues surrounding the low-cost technologies, including machine developments due to patent expiry, the rise of the Maker movement and some of the new business models that haveresulted. 12.1 Introduction When the ﬁrst additive manufacturing machines came on to the market for thepurposes of rapid prototyping, they were, not surprisingly, very expensive. The factthat they were aimed at early adopters, based around complex and newtechnologies, like lasers, and only produced in small volumes meant that purchaseof such machines left you with little change from a quarter of a million US dollarsor even more. Furthermore, the perceived value of these machines to these earlyadopters was also very high. Even at these prices the Return on Investment (ROI) was often only a matter of months or attributable to a small selection of high-value projects. An automotive manufacturer could, for example, achieve the ROI just byproving the AM technology ensured a new vehicle was launched on or ahead oftime. Such perceived value did little to bring the prices of these machines down. As the technology became more popular, the market became more competitive. However, demand for these new machines was also high, particularly from thetraditional market drivers of automotive, aerospace, and medicine as mentioned inprevious chapters. Vendors did ﬁnd themselves in competition with each other, but there were many different customers. Furthermore, different machines were exhibiting different strengths and weaknesses that the vendors exploited to develop #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_12293differing markets. For most of these markets, the more successful vendors also ensured they had excellent intellectual property (IP) protection. All of this served tomaintain the technology at a high cost. Ultimately it was the issues surrounding IP that led to the current situation. Many of the original technologies were protected by patents that prevented othercompanies from copying them. The vendor companies were also very aggressivein defending their IP as well as buying up related IP and their associated companieswhere they existed. This competitive market did have the effect of slowly erodingthe vendor companies’ proﬁt margins, but huge changes have recently taken placeas a result of these patents lapsing. We will go on in this chapter to discuss how thishas impacted the low-cost AM technology marketplace. The key patents will be discussed as well as the more prominent players in this ﬁeld. This activity has fuelled a huge amount of interest by the media, which will be discussed in terms ofhow it has in turn impacted the industry. Much of this interest can be associatedwith what is becoming known as disruptive innovation. AM certainly ﬁts with anumber of other technologies to form the basis for disruptive business models,which we will discuss. AM also is a huge enabling technology that has assistedmany home users to solve many of their own technical problems at home. Sharingthese experiences and even proﬁting from them has spearheaded what is being commonly called the Maker Movement, which we shall also examine. We will go on to consider how this branch of AM may develop in the future. 12.2 Intellectual Property As mentioned in the introduction and in other parts of this book, the key patentswith the most protection originated in the USA. While there was activity in othercountries, 3D Systems, Stratasys, DTM, and Helisys were the principal vendornames for much of the world in the early days. Other companies were also present,like EOS, Sony, Sanders, and Objet, but they either came along at a later date orwere in close IP conﬂict with these American vendors. European and US patent law for technology are somewhat similar to each other in that they refer to a 20-year term from the initial ﬁling date of the patent in mostcases. Charles Hull ﬁled his ﬁrst Stereolithography patent in 1984 [ 1], which therefore expired in 2004. Scott Crump patented the Fused Deposition Modelingprocess in 1989 [ 2], which means that patent expired in 2009. The major difference between these technologies, in this context, is that the melt extrusion process ismuch easier to replicate at a low cost compared with the laser-cured photopolymersystems. It is evident therefore that while the door to widespread development was opened in 2004, it was not opened wide until 2009 and beyond. This is evident from the ﬁgures quoted by Terry Wohlers from 2008 to 2013, shown in Fig. 12.1, concerning the number of low-cost AM machines purchased over that period [ 3]. Of course this is not the complete story. While the original patents were ﬁled in the 1980s, additional patents have been constantly ﬁled ever since. If one noticesthat there have been many copies of the original FDM patent, all the resulting294 12 The Impact of Low-Cost AM Systemsmachines have thus far not implemented an environmental control apparatus. This is because the patent for this development was not ﬁled by Crump until a few years later. There is an excellent review of the recently expiring and shortly expiring patents carried out by Hornick and Roland [ 4]. In it they make a number of interesting observations that lead to the following discussion: – There is a huge number of patents involved and it is a very difﬁcult process to navigate through them. Many patents make multiple claims across numerous platforms. They often do not adhere to a single process. – Earlier patents discuss broad-based approaches that are in fact quite easy to defend and/or ﬁnd ways around. It is quite easy to distinguish one process fromanother since they do not have the beneﬁts that are gained through experience ofactual application of the technology. Later patents obviously result fromdiscoveries resulting from use of these base technologies, which discuss subtlefeatures like soluble supports or ﬁll patterns. – While 3D Systems patents are among the earliest to expire, there are obvious technical complexities in them that would make them difﬁcult to replicate without signiﬁcant industrial backing. An example relates to the formulationof resins to speed up the curing and build process or another to facilitate evenspreading of resins. 2008355 18165978242653550872503 01000020000300004000050000600007000080000 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013Fig. 12.1 Wohlers’ data showing how the numbers of low-cost AM machines has increased from virtually nothing in 200812.2 Intellectual Property 295– Some key droplet deposition and powder sintering by laser patents expired in late 2014, early 2015. Expiration of these patents may help to open up the high-end, high-quality AM market by bringing the machine costs down. At the time of writing this chapter it is merely speculation, but it will be interesting to see how some of the large printing or equipment manufacturingcompanies view these as opportunities. One can anticipate that a large printercompany may possess the necessary knowledge, resources, and infrastructure toproduce high-quality AM equipment in volume at very reasonable costs. It is worthnoting that although low-cost AM started with material extrusion technology, sincethey were the easiest to produce and some of the ﬁrst patents to expire, low-cost versions of photopolymerization (Formlabs), polymer laser sintering (Norge), and even metal machines such as metal laser sintering (Matterfab) and lower-costdirected energy deposition heads (Hybrid Manufacturing Technologies or theLENS print engine) are starting to proliferate. 12.3 Disruptive Innovation 12.3.1 Disruptive Business Opportunities Disruptive innovation and disruptive technology are terms that were originallydeﬁned by Christensen to describe activities or technology that create new markets [5]. A very obvious example of this is how the Internet made it possible to create online businesses which could not have existed before. However, the effects may bemuch more subtle and it is possible to create a disruptive business merely by usingexisting technology in a different way. Often this process can be achieved by earlyadopters of technology or by those who have skills that are either difﬁcult to learn ornot commonly used in a disruptive way. Here we can say that although there aremany musicians, there is only one David Bowie or Lady Gaga, who made use oftheir artistic talents to generate additional business opportunities. There is no doubt that AM is a disruptive technology, which can be combined with other technologies to generate new businesses. Improvements and morewidespread use of CAD technology has made it possible for individuals to designproducts with minimal cost and training. Google Sketchup and Tinkercad are onlinedesign tools that are basically free to use. While they are not as powerful andversatile as paid CAD software, these accessible and simple to use tools haveopened up a new market for home designers, who would then like to ﬁnd outletsfor these designs. While eventually this may mean all of these people will have machines in their homes, we are not quite there yet. Some people may have a low-cost AM machine at home, but even these may not meet the functionalrequirements and so will look to outside services to build and supply their designs.This has led to the establishment of companies who provide online services wheredesigners can not only have their models made but also ﬁnd an outlet where theirdesigns can also be sold. Shapeways and i.materialise (see Fig. 12.2) both operate in296 12 The Impact of Low-Cost AM Systemsthis space, using techniques developed for social media platforms, where viewers can “like” other people’s designs as well as discuss, share, and promote them. Forthose wishing to share designs but not concerned with the commercial aspects, thereare also portals like the Thingiverse web site. Issues surrounding copyright ofdesigns are regularly discussed around these web sites. Replicas or models inspiredby merchandising for TV and movie shows for example can be regularly found on these sites and some sharing sites will have more or less control than others. 12.3.2 Media Attention Since disruptive innovation is always going to attract media attention, it is worth considering some of the more prominent stories that have attracted interest and therefore structured how the general public view AM. The ﬁrst example that springs to many people’s minds would be the use of AM to create ﬁrearms. A great deal of attention was directed towards AM when it wasrealized that it was possible to create ﬁrearms using the technology, the most well-known of these being the Liberator, single-shot pistol [ 6]. Here, it was discovered that this gun could be largely manufactured using an AM machine and that the plansfor its manufacture were posted online. A primary reason for this attracting so muchattention was the obvious contentious nature of the topic, backed up by the fact that this design can be easily shared on the Internet. It was particularly interesting to note that the attention was focused on the negative impact of AM rather than that ofthe Internet. There are a number of issues that are worth discussing here: Fig. 12.2 Web site image for i.materialise, showing how designers can post their ideas on the web and have them built and made available for others to buy12.3 Disruptive Innovation 297– While the gun was indeed built, certain items like the ﬁring pin and obviously the ammunition would need to be added to the design. – The original gun was created using a relatively high-end AM machine by a skilled operator. Sharing of the design online does not include the build parameters and a study by the New South Wales police in Australia revealedthat the user is at great risk if the gun is not built correctly [ 7]. – Improvised ﬁrearms have been possible for many years and can be constructed by anyone with a small amount of technical knowledge and access to simplemanufacturing equipment [ 8]. Admittedly, AM can be used like any technology, for good or for bad. However, we can see here how the media can latch on to one example and confuse the public image. These examples did bring the technology into a much wider public domainthan previously and therefore allowed specialists in the ﬁeld the opportunity tomore properly explain the true impact of AM. In stark contrast to the use of AM for destructive purposes, there have been numerous articles that describe how AM can be used to create replacement bodyparts [ 9]. As described in the chapter on Applications in this book, there is a huge potential for AM to contribute in this direction. The problem in the media coverage however is the time frame attached to this. Some applications have been implemented where AM has made signiﬁcant improvements in medical andhealthcare. However, this cannot be easily generalized into a conclusion that allmedical problems can be solved this way. We must expect signiﬁcant developmentsin the technology before we can make that conclusion and the AM machines of thefuture will look nothing like the machines we have today. Furthermore, we needparallel efforts in the biomedical sciences as well because they are far from beingready to plug in directly to AM devices. Specialists in these ﬁelds need to under- stand that, while it is reasonable to speculate that AM for body parts is on the horizon, they must be wary of that message being misconstrued. Another sector that has attracted the media attention is the “cool gadget” area. One early example that again elevated general public awareness was The Econo-mist magazine front-page article titled “Print me a Stradivarius” (see Fig. 12.3). This was probably the ﬁrst mass-market article that highlighted how AM could beused for truly functional applications. While other media sites have included similararticles somewhere in their portfolios, the fact that this was on the front-page of an international magazine certainly had an impact. It is also worthwhile taking note that the BBC have published regular articles about AM over the years, averagingaround 1 every 2 months or so in a wide variety of areas. In relation to this chapter, the reason for including these articles is because of the increasing number of personal users of AM machines. All of these articles have onething in common: they imply that you will eventually be able to create solutions foryourself.298 12 The Impact of Low-Cost AM Systems12.4 The Maker Movement As alluded to earlier in this chapter, the number of users who have their own AM machines has increased dramatically and they are driving much of the innovationthat we are seeing. The technology is often aimed originally at providing solutionsfor problems that the user has experienced around his or her home or workplace.Social media and other outlets have allowed these users to demonstrate thesesolutions and thus inspire other users to do the same. While social media doeshelp in dissemination, physical demonstration is usually a much more effective way of presenting your designs. To this effect, Maker Faires ®have almost literally taken the world by storm, as can be seen in Fig. 12.4. Maker Faires®are events where “Makers” congregate to display, demonstrate, and trade in items that they have designed and built themselves. While there is a lotof emphasis on technology, there is equal emphasis on design, environment,engagement, and fun in these fairs. Additive manufacturing is certainly a compo-nent in this, but so are Arduino and Raspberry Pi microcontrollers, laser cutting,conventional machine and hand tools, and home crafting skills like carving, sewing, and knitting. Many Makers merge technology with more conventional craft and design to come up with often personalized, often quirky systems that they wouldlike others to see. The low-cost AM technologies have found a huge following Fig. 12.3 The Economist magazine front cover12.4 The Maker Movement 299within this Maker movement that is fuelling a large amount of innovation and even spinning off into new commercial ventures. Perhaps not surprisingly this Maker movement originated in the USA, originally promoted by Make magazine [ 10] for the ﬁrst event in California in 2006. The USA has a long and distinguished culture of innovation, perhaps spawning from theoriginal frontier mentality of having to make do with whatever is around you, andthis can also be seen in terms of how innovation is an accepted part of everyday lifethere. However, the concept of the fair is now a worldwide phenomenon with dozens of events held yearly attracting thousands of exhibitors and hundreds of thousands of attendees. The Maker Faire ®has become the spiritual home for the Makerbot and other similar low-cost AM technologies, including the RepRapdesigns [ 11], and for design sharing portals like Thingiverse. A huge number of commercial entry-level machines can thank the RepRap project for their origins. It would be almost impossible to identify every company,there are so many with varying levels of success. Designs have evolved consider-ably from the original RepRap machines, but the basic principle remains very much the same, exploiting the hot-melt extrusion process that was facilitated by the FDM patent expiry. The Maker movement, along with the FabLab [ 12] and Idea to Product (I2P [ 13]) concepts, has done much to highlight the beneﬁts of AM and associatedtechnologies to the general public. The FabLab and the I2P labs are walk-infacilities aimed at providing an environment that encourages people to experimentwith accessible manufacturing technologies and develop their ideas. Often the costsare at least partially absorbed by local authorities or donations. These are different from what is referred to as hardware incubators, where the costs are sourced from an investor network. All of these recognize in some way that there is a need to fosterthe creative processes. Fig 12.4 Maker Faire web page300 12 The Impact of Low-Cost AM Systems12.5 The Future of Low-Cost AM Low-cost AM has done much to bring the technology into the public domain. While it may be that it has taken some time to get to this stage with many of the currentissues having been dealt with by early adopters, there has never been a better time to get involved in AM. A lot of confusion still surrounds what AM can and cannot do but even some of the negative press coverage has helped to promote the technologyin some manner. While the majority of AM machines have exploited the StratasysFDM, melt extrusion process, recent patent expirations of other AM technologieshave started to open the doors to some interesting new low-cost technologies in thenear future. 12.6 Exercises What low-cost technologies are available in your area? Are there any local vendors and are their machines different in any way to the standard Makerbotand RepRap variants? Examine articles about AM in the press. Is the information presented accurate? Would you write the article in a different way? Does inaccurate reporting haveany impact on how the general public views AM technology? What other technologies are represented at Maker Faires? Consider the copyright infringement issues that surrounded the development of YouTube. Could similar things happen with respect to model sharing sites in thefuture? How can this be regulated?

The performance capabilities of materialsand machines lag behind conventional manufacturing technology (e.g., injectionmolding machinery), although the lag is decreasing. Speed and cost, in terms oftime to market, are where AM technology contributes, particularly for complex or customized geometries. 13.1 Introduction The initial purpose of rapid prototyping technology was to create parts as a meansof visual and tactile communication. Since those early days of rapid prototyping, the applications of additive manufacturing processes have expanded considerably.According to Wohlers and Associates [ 1], parts from AM machines are used for a number of purposes, including:  Visual aids  Presentation models Functional models  Fit and assembly  Patterns for prototype tooling Patterns for metal castings Tooling components Direct digital/rapid manufacturing AM processes, like all materials processing, are constrained by material properties, speed, cost, and accuracy. The performance capabilities of materials and machines lag behind conventional manufacturing technology (e.g., injection molding machinery), although the lag is decreasing. Speed and cost, in terms of #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_13303time to market, are where AM technology contributes, particularly for complex or customized geometries. With the growth of AM, there is going to be increasing demand for software that supports making decisions regarding which machines to use and their capabilities and limitations for a speciﬁc part design. In particular, software systems can help inthe decision-making process for capital investment of new technology, providingaccurate estimates of cost and time for quoting purposes, and assistance in processplanning. This chapter deals with three typical problems involving AM that may beneﬁt from decision support: 1.Quotation support . Given a part, which machine and material should I use to build? 2.Capital investment support . Given a design and industrial proﬁle, what is the best machine that I can buy to fulﬁll my requirements? 3.Process planning support . Given a part and a machine, how do I set it up to work in the most efﬁcient manner alongside my other operations and existing tasks? Examples of systems designed to fulﬁll the ﬁrst two problems are described in detail. The third problem is much more difﬁcult and is discussed brieﬂy. 13.2 Selection Methods for a Part 13.2.1 Decision Theory Decision theory has a rich history, evolving in the 1940s and 1950s from the ﬁeld of economics [ 2]. Although there are many approaches taken in the decision theory ﬁeld, the focus in this chapter will be only on the utility theory approach. Broadlyspeaking, there are three elements of any decision [ 3]:  Options—the items from which the decision maker is selecting  Expectations—of possible outcomes for each option Preferences—how the decision maker values each outcome Assume that the set of decision options is denoted as A¼{A 1,A2,...,An}. In engineering applications, one can think of outcomes as the performance of theoptions as measured by a set of evaluation criteria. More speciﬁcally, in AMselection, an outcome might consist of the time, cost, and surface ﬁnish of a part built using a certain AM process, while the AM process itself is the option. Expectations of outcomes are modeled as functions of the options, X¼g(A), and may be modeled with associated uncertainties. Preferences model the importance assigned to outcomes by the decision maker. For example, a designer may prefer low cost and short turn-around times for aconcept model, while being willing to accept poor surface ﬁnish. In many ad hoc304 13 Guidelines for Process Selectiondecision support methods, preferences are modeled as weights or importances, which are represented as scalars. Typically, weights are speciﬁed so that theysum to 1 (normalized). For simple problems, the decision maker may just choose weights, while for more complex decisions, more sophisticated methods are used, such as pair-wise comparison [ 4]. In utility theory, preferences are modeled as utility functions on the expectations. Expectations are then modeled as expectedutility. The best alternative is the one with the greatest expected utility. F. Mistree, J.K. Allen, and their coworkers have been developing the Decision Support Problem (DSP) Technique over the last 20 years. The advantages of DSPs,compared with other decision formulations, are that they provide a means formathematically modeling design decisions involving multiple objectives and supporting human judgment in designing systems [ 5,6]. The formulation and solution of DSPs facilitate several types of decisions, including: Selection—the indication of preference, based on multiple attributes, for one among several alternatives, [ 7]. Compromise—the improvement of an alternative through modiﬁcation [ 4,6]. Coupled and hierarchical—decisions that are linked together, such as selection– selection, compromise–compromise, or selection–compromise [ 6]. The selection problems being addressed in this chapter will be divided into two related selection subproblems. First, it is necessary to generate feasible alternatives, which, in this case, include materials and processes. Second, given those feasiblealternatives, a quantiﬁcation process is applied that results in a rank-ordered list ofalternatives. The ﬁrst subproblem is referred to as “Determining Feasibility,” whilethe second is simply called “Selection.” Additional feasibility determination andselection methods will be discussed in this section as well. 13.2.2 Approaches to Determining Feasibility The problem of identifying suitable materials and AM machines with which tofabricate a part is surprisingly complex. As noted previously, there are many possible applications for an AM part. For each application, one should consider the suitability of available materials, fabrication cost and time, surface ﬁnish andaccuracy requirements, part size, feature sizes, mechanical properties, resistance tochemicals, and other application-speciﬁc considerations. To complicate matters,the number and capability of commercial materials and machines continues toincrease. So, in order to solve AM machine and process chain selection problems,one must navigate the wide variety of materials and machines, comparing one’sneeds to their capabilities, while ensuring that the most up-to-date information is available. To date, most approaches to determining feasibility have taken a knowledge- based approach in order to deal with the qualitative information related to AMprocess capability. One of the better developed approaches was presented by Deglinand Bernard [ 8]. They presented a knowledge-based system for the generation, selection, and process planning of production AM processes. The problem as they13.2 Selection Methods for a Part 305deﬁned it was: “To propose, from a detailed functional speciﬁcation, different alternatives of rapid manufacturing processes, which can be ordered and optimizedwhen considering a combination of different speciﬁcation criteria (cost, quality, delay, aspect, material, etc.).” Their approach utilized two reasoning methods, case- based and the bottom-up generation of processes; the strengths of eachcompensated for the other’s weaknesses. Their system was developed on theKADVISER platform and utilized a relational database system with extensivematerial, machine, and application information. A group at the National University of Singapore (NUS) developed an AM decision system that was integrated with a database system [ 9,10]. Their selection system was capable of identifying feasible material/machine combinations, estimating manufacturing cost and time, and determining optimal part orientations. From the feasible material/machines, the user can then select the most suitablecombination. Their approach to determining feasible materials and processes isbroadly similar to the work of Deglin and Bernard. The NUS group utilized ﬁvedatabases, each organized in a hierarchical, object-oriented manner: three generaldatabases (materials, machines, and applications) and two part-speciﬁc databases(geometric information and model speciﬁcations). Several web-based AM selection systems are available. One was developed at the Helsinki University of Technology (see http://ltk.hut.ﬁ/RP-Selector/ ). Through a series of questions, the selector acquires information about the part accuracy,layer thickness, geometric features, material, and application requirements. Theuser chooses one of 4–5 options for each question. Additionally, the user speciﬁespreferences for each requirement using a 5-element scale from insigniﬁcant toaverage to important. When all 10–12 questions are answered, the user receives aset of recommended AM machines that best satisfy their requirements. The problem of determining process and material feasibility can be represented by the Preliminary Selection Decision Support Problem (ps-DSP) [ 11]. The word formulation of the ps-DSP is given in Fig. 13.1. This is a structured decision formulation and corresponds to a formal decision method based on decision theory.Qualitative comparisons among processes and materials, with respect to decisioncriteria, are sufﬁcient to identify feasible alternatives and eliminate infeasible ones.After more quantitative information is known, more detailed evaluations ofalternatives can be made, as described in the next subsection. Given: a set of concepts Identify: The principal criteria influencing selection. The relative importance of the criteria Capture: Experience-based knowledge about the concepts with respect to a datum and the established criteria. Rank: The concepts in order of preference based on multiple criteria and their relative importance. Fig. 13.1 Preliminary selection decision support problem word formulation306 13 Guidelines for Process SelectionThe key step in the ps-DSP is how to capture and apply experience-based knowledge. One chooses a datum concept against which all other concepts arecompared. Qualitative comparisons are performed, where a concept is judged as better, worse, or about the same (+1, /C01, 0, respectively) as the datum with respect to the principal criteria for the selection problem. Then, a weighted sum ofcomparisons with the datum is computed. Typically, this procedure is repeatedfor several additional choices of datums. In this manner, one gets a good under-standing of the relative merits and deﬁciencies of each concept. The ps-DSP has been applied to various engineering problems, most recently for a problem to design an AM process to fabricate metal lattice structures [ 12]. 13.2.3 Approaches to Selection As stated earlier, there have been a number of approaches taken to support the selection of AM processes for a part. Most aid selection, but only in a qualitativemanner, as described earlier. Several methods have been developed in academiathat are based on the large literature on decision theory. For an excellent introduc- tion to this topic, see the book by Keeney and Raiffa [ 2]. In this section, the selection DSP is covered in some detail and selection using utility theory issummarized. While the basic advantages of using DSPs of any type lie in providing context and structure for engineering problems, regardless of complexity, they also facili-tate the recording of viewpoints associated with these decisions, for completenessand future reference, and evaluation of results through post solution sensitivityanalysis. The standard Selection Decision Support Problem (s-DSP) has been applied to many engineering problems and has recently been applied to AM selection [ 13]. The word formulation of the standard s-DSP is given in Fig. 13.2. Note that the decision options for AM selection are feasible material-processcombinations. Expectations are determined by rating the options against theattributes. Preferences are modeled using simple importance values. Rank orderingof options is determined using a weighted-sum expression of importance andattribute ratings. An extension to include utility theory has recently been accom-plished, as described next. For the Identify step, evaluation attributes are to be speciﬁed. For example, accuracy, cost, build time, tensile strength, and feature detail (how small of afeature can be created) are typical attributes. Scales denote how the attribute is to Given: Set of AM processes/machines and materials (alternatives) Identify: Set of evaluation attributes. Create scales and determine importances. Rate: Each alternative relative to each attribute. Rank: AM methods from most to least promising Fig. 13.2 Word formulation of the selection decision support problem13.2 Selection Methods for a Part 307be measured. For example, the cost scale is typically measured in dollars and is to be minimized. Tensile strength is measured in MPa and is to be maximized. Theseare examples of ratio scales, since they are measured using real numbers. Interval scales, on the other hand, are measured using integers. Complexity capability is an example attribute that could be measured using an interval scale from 1 to 10, where10 represents the highest complexity. The decision maker should formulate intervalscales carefully so that many of the integers in the scale have clear deﬁnitions. Inaddition to specifying scales, the decision maker should also specify minimum andmaximum values for each attribute. Finally, the decision maker is to specifypreferences using importance values or weights for each attribute. For the Rate step of the s-DSP, each alternative AM process or machine should be evaluated against each attribute. From the Identify step, each attribute, a i, has minimum and maximum values speciﬁed, ai,minand ai,max, respectively. The decision maker speciﬁes a rating value for attribute aijfor each alternative, j, that lies between ai,minandai,max. The ﬁnal step is to normalize the ratings so that they always take on values between 0 and 1. For cases where the attribute is to bemaximized, ( 13.1) is used to normalize each attribute rating, where r ijis the normalized rating for attribute iand alternative j.(13.2) is used to normalize attribute ratings when the attribute is to be minimized. rij¼aij/C0aij,min aij,max/C0aij,minð13:1Þ rij¼aij,max/C0aij aij,max/C0aij,minð13:2Þ After all attributes are rated, the total merit for each alternative is computed using a weighted-sum formulation, as shown in ( 13.3). The Iiare the importances, or weights. Note that the merit value Miis always normalized between 0 and 1. Mj¼X j¼1Iirij ð13:3Þ After computing the merit of each alternative, the alternatives can be rank ordered from the most favorable to the least. If two or more alternatives are close to the highest rank, additional investigation should be undertaken to understand under which conditions each alternative may be favored over the others. Addition-ally, the alternatives could be developed further so that more information aboutthem is known. It is also helpful to run multiple sets of preferences (calledscenarios) to understand how emphasis on certain attributes can lead to alternativesbecoming favored. Decision theory has a rich history, evolving in the 1940s and 1950s from the ﬁeld of economics [ 2]. In order to provide a rigorous, preference-consistent alternative to the traditional merit function for considering alternatives with uncertain attribute values, the area of utility theory is often applied. This requires the satisfaction of a308 13 Guidelines for Process Selectionset of axioms such as those proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstern [ 14], Luce and Raiffa [ 15], or Savage [ 16], describing the preferences of rational individuals. Once satisﬁed, there then exists a utility function with the desirable property of assigning numerical utilities to all possible consequences. In utility theory, preferences are modeled as utility functions on the expectations. Mathematically, let alternative Airesult in outcome xi∈Xwith probability pi, if outcomes are discrete. Otherwise, expectations on outcomes are modeled using probability density functions, fi¼fi(xi). Utility is denoted u(x). Expectations are then modeled as expected utility as shown in ( 13.4). EuxðÞ½/C138 ¼X piux iðÞ for discrete outcomes EuxðÞ½/C138 ¼ uxðÞgxðÞfor continuous outcomesð13:4Þ This leads to the primary decision rule of utility theory: Select the alternative whose outcome has the largest expected utility.Note that expected utility is a probabilistic quantity, not a certain quantity, so there is always risk inherent in these decisions. Utility functions are constructed by determining points that represent the deci- sion maker’s preferences then ﬁtting a utility curve to these points. The extremepoints indicate ideal and unacceptable values. These points are labeled as x *andx0, respectively, and are assigned utilities of 1 and 0, respectively, in Fig. 13.3. The remaining points are usually obtained by asking the decision maker a series ofquestions (for more information, please consult a standard reference on utilitytheory, e.g., [ 2]). Speciﬁcally, a decision maker is asked to identify his/her certainty equivalent for a few 50–50 lotteries. A lottery is a hypothetical situation in which the outcome of a decision is uncertain; it is used to assess a decision maker’s preferences. A certainty equivalent is the level of an attribute for which the decisionmaker would be indifferent between receiving that attribute level for certain and receiving the results of a speciﬁed 50–50 lottery. For example, to obtain the value ofx 0.5in Fig. 13.3, the decision maker is asked to identify his/her certainty equivalent to the lottery. Generally, at least ﬁve points are identiﬁed along the decisionmaker’s utility curve. This preference assessment procedure must be repeated foreach of the attributes of interest. In the 5-point form, typical utility functions have the form uxðÞ ¼ cþbe /C0ax: ð13:5Þ1 0.75 0.5 0.25 X0X0.25 X0.5 X0.75 X1xutilityFig. 13.3 Utility curve from ﬁve data points13.2 Selection Methods for a Part 309By complementing the standard selection DSP with utility theory, an axiomatic basis is provided for accurately reﬂecting the preferences of a designer for tradeoffsand uncertainty associated with multiple attributes. The utility selection DSP has been formulated and applied to several engineering problems, including AM selection [ 5,17]. Quite a few other researchers have applied utility theory to engineering selection problems; one of the original works in this area is [ 18]. 13.2.4 Selection Example In this section, we present an example of a capital investment decision related to the application of metal AM processes to the production manufacture of steel casterwheels. This selection problem is very similar to a quotation problem, but includesa range of part dimensions, not single dimension values for one part. In thisscenario, the caster wheel manufacturer is attempting to select an AM machinethat can be used for production of its small custom orders. It is infeasible to stock allthe combinations of wheels that they want to offer, thus they need to be able toproduce these quickly, while also keeping the price down for the customer. The technologies under consideration are Direct Metal Deposition, Direct Metal Laser Sintering, Electron Beam Melting, Laser Engineered Net Shaping, Selective LaserMelting, and Selective Laser Sintering. A readily available stainless steel material(whatever was commercially available for the process) was used for this example.The processes will be numbered randomly (Processes 1–6) for the purposes ofpresentation, since this example was developed in the mid-2000s [ 19] and, as a result, the data are obsolete. Before beginning the selection process, the uncertainty involved in the customi- zation process was considered. Since these caster wheels will be customized, there is a degree of geometric uncertainty involved. A model of a caster wheel is displayed in the Fig. 13.4a , while its main dimensions are shown in Fig. 13.4b . In this example, we have decided to only allow customization of certain features. Only standard 12 mm diameter /C2100 mm length bolts will be used for the inner bore, therefore, these dimensions will beconstrained. Customers will be allowed to customize all other features of the casterwheel within allowable ranges for this model wheel, as displayed in Table 13.1. The alternative AM technologies will be evaluated based on 7 attributes that span a typical range of requirements, as shown in the following section. Scale typerefers to the method used to quantify the attribute. For example, ultimate tensilestrength is a ratio scale, meaning that it is represented by a real number, in this casewith units of MPa. Geometric complexity is an example of an interval scale, in thiscase with ratings between 1 and 10, with 1 meaning the lowest complexity and10 meaning the greatest amount of complexity.310 13 Guidelines for Process Selection Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS): UTS is the maximum stress reached before a material fracture. Ratio scale [MPa].  Rockwell Hardness C (Hard): Hardness is commonly deﬁned as the resistance of a material to indentation. Ratio scale [HRc].  Density (Dens.): The density refers to the ﬁnal density of the part after all processing steps. This density is proportional to the amount of voids found atthe surface. These voids cause a rough surface ﬁnish. Ratio scale [%].  Detail Capability (DC): The detail capability is the smallest feature size the technology can make. Ratio scale [mm].  Geometric complexity (GC): The geometric complexity is the ability of the technology to build complex parts. More speciﬁcally, in this case, it is used torefer to the ability to produce overhangs. Interval scale (1–10).  Build Time (Time): The build time refers to the time required to fabricate a part, not including post-processing steps. Ratio scale [h].  Part Cost (Cost): The part cost is the cost it takes to build one part with all costs included. These costs include manufacturing cost, material cost, machine cost,and operation cost. Ratio scale [$]. solid model of caster profile with dimensionsCore O.D.Core I.W.Bore O.D.Bore I.D.

In Scenario 1, geometric complexity was most heavily weighted becauseof the signiﬁcant overhangs present in the build orientation of the casters. Build time and part cost were also heavily weighted because of their importance to the business structure surrounding customization of caster wheels. Because of theenvironment of use of the caster wheels, UTS was also given a high weighting.Detail capability was weighted least because of the lack of small, detailed featuresin the geometry of the caster wheels. In Scenario 2, all selection attributes wereequally weighted. Table 13.2 shows the results of the evaluation of the alternatives with respect to the attributes. Weights for the two scenarios, called Relative Importances, are included under the attribute names. On the basis of these ratings, the overall merit for each alternative can be computed. Merit values for each scenario are given in Table 13.3, along with their rankings. Note that slightly different rankings are evident from the differentscenarios. This indicates the importance of accurately capturing decision maker’spreferences. Process 4 is the top ranking process in both scenarios. However, thesecond choice could be Process 2, 3, or 6, depending upon preferences. In cases likethis, it is a good idea to run additional scenarios in order to understand the trade-offs that are relevant. This capital investment example illustrated the application of selection decision support methods. As mentioned, it is very important to explore several scenarios(sets of preferences) to understand the sensitivities of ratings and rankings tochanges in preferences. Modiﬁcations to the method are straightforward to achievetarget values, instead of minimizing or maximizing an attribute, and to incorporateother types of uncertainty. 13.3 Challenges of Selection The example from the previous section illustrates some of the difﬁculties and limitations of straightforward application of decision methods to real decision- making situations. The complex relationships among attributes, and the variationsthat can arise when building a wide range of parts, make it difﬁcult to decoupledecision attributes and develop structured decision problems. Nonetheless, with aproper understanding of technologies and attributes, and how to relate themtogether, meaningful information can be gained. This section takes a brief look atthese issues. Different AM systems are focused on slightly different markets. For example, there are large, expensive machines that can fabricate parts using a variety of materials with relatively good accuracy and/or material properties and with theability to ﬁne-tune the systems to meet speciﬁc needs. In contrast, there are cheapersystems, which are designed to have minimal setup and to produce parts ofacceptable quality in a predictable and reliable manner. In this latter case, partsmay not have high accuracy, material strength, or ﬂexibility of use.312 13 Guidelines for Process SelectionTable 13.2 Rating alternatives with respect to attributes Attributes UTS Hardness Density Detail cap.Geom. compl.

Machines vary in terms of cost, size, range of materials, accuracy of part, time of build, etc. Itis not surprising to know that the more expensive machines provide the wider rangeof options and, therefore, it is important for someone looking to buy a new machineto be able to understand the costs vs. the beneﬁts so that it is possible to choose thebest machine to suit their needs. Approaching a manufacturer or distributor of AM equipment is one way to get information concerning the speciﬁcation of their machine. Such companies are obviously biased towards their own product and, therefore, it is going to be difﬁcult to obtain truly objective opinions. Conventions and exhibitions are a good way tomake comparisons, but it is not necessarily easy to identify the usability ofmachines. Contacting existing users is sometimes difﬁcult and time consuming,but they can give very honest opinions. This approach works best if you are alreadyequipped with background information concerning your proposed use of thetechnology. When looking for advice about suitable selection methods or systems, it is useful to consider the following points. One web-based system was developed to meet these considerations [ 20]. An alternative approach will be presented in the next section.  The information in the system should be unbiased wherever possible.  The method/system should provide support and advice rather than just a quantiﬁed result.  The method/system should provide an introduction to AM to equip the user with background knowledge as well as advice on different AM technologies.  A range of options should be given to the user in order to adjust requirements and show how changes in requirements may affect the decision.  The system should be linked to a comprehensive and up-to-date database of AM machines.  After the search process has completed, the system should give guidance on where to look next for additional information. The process of accessing the system should be as beneﬁcial to the user as the answers it gives. However, this is not as easy a task as one might ﬁrst envisage. If itwere possible to decouple the attributes of the system from the user speciﬁcation,Table 13.3 Merit values and rankingsScenario 1 Scenario 2 Merit Rank Merit Rank Proc 1 0.254 6 0.284 6 Proc 2 0.743 2 0.667 4Proc 3 0.689 4 0.703 2Proc 4 0.753 1 0.808 1Proc 5 0.528 5 0.539 5 Proc 6 0.72 3 0.697 3314 13 Guidelines for Process Selectionthen it would be a relatively simple task to select one machine against another. To illustrate that this is not always possible, consider the following scenarios: In a Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) machine, warm-up and cool down are important stages during the build cycle that do not directly involve parts being fabricated.This means that large parts do not take proportionally longer times to buildcompared with smaller ones. Large builds are more efﬁcient than small ones. InVat Photopolymerization (VP) and Material Extrusion (ME) machines, there is amuch stronger correlation between part size and build time. Small parts wouldtherefore take less time on a VP or ME machine than when using PBF, ifconsidered in isolation. Many users, however, batch process their builds and the ability to vertically stack parts in a PBF machine makes it generally possible to utilize the available space more efﬁciently. The warm-up and cool downoverheads are less important for larger builds and the time per layer is generallyquicker than most SL and ME machines. As a result of this discussion, it is noteasy to see which machine would be quicker without carefully analyzing theentire process plan for using a new machine. Generally, it costs less to buy a Dimension or other low-end ME machine compared to a Binder Jetting (BJ) machine. There are technical differences between these machines that make them suitable for different potential applications. However, because they are in a similar price bracket, they areoften compared for similar applications. Dimension ME machines use acartridge-based material delivery system that requires a complete replacementof the cartridge when empty. This makes material use much more expensivewhen compared with the 3D Systems BJ (aka “ZCorp”) machine. For occasionaluse, it is therefore perhaps better to use a Dimension machine when all factorsare equal. On the other hand, the more parts you build, the more cost-effective the BJ machine becomes. Identifying a new application or market can completely change the economics of a machine. For example, in the metals area, directed energy deposition machines(e.g., LENS, DMD) tend to be slower and have worse feature detail capabilitythan powder bed metal machines (e.g., SLM, EBM, DMLS). This has led tomany more machine sales for ARCAM, Renishaw, and EOS. However, somecompanies identiﬁed a market for repairing molds and metal parts, which is verydifﬁcult, if not impossible, with a powder bed machine. These examples indicate that selection results depend to a large extent on the user’s knowledge of AM capabilities and applications. Selection tools that includeexpert systems may have an advantage over tools based on straightforward decisionmethods alone. Expert systems attempt to embody the expertise resulting fromextensive use of AM technology into a software package that can assist the user inovercoming at least some of the learning curve quickly and in a single stage. See[20] for a more complete coverage of this idea.13.3 Challenges of Selection 31513.4 Example System for Preliminary Selection A preliminary selection tool was developed for AM, called AMSelect, that walks the user through a series of questions to identify feasible processes and machines[21]. Build times and costs are computed, but quantitative rating and rank-ordering are not performed. More speciﬁcally, the software enables designers, managers, and service bureau personnel to:  Explore AM technologies for their application in a possible DDM project  Identify candidate materials and processes Explore build times, build options, costs Explore manufacturing and life-cycle beneﬁts of AM Select appropriate AM technologies for DDM applications  Explore case studies, anticipate beneﬁts  Support Quotation and Capital Investment decisions Figure 13.5 illustrates the logic underlying AMSelect. A database of machine types and capabilities is read, which represents the set of machines that the softwarewill consider. The software supports a qualitative assessment of the suitability ofDDM for the application, then enables the user to explore the performance ofvarious AM machines. Build time and cost estimates are provided, which enable the user to make a selection decision. To use AMSelect, the user ﬁrst enters information about the production project, including production rate (parts per week), target part cost, how long the part isexpected to be in production, and the useful life of the part. After the user enters Fig. 13.5 Flowchart of AMSelect operation316 13 Guidelines for Process Selectioninformation about the part to be produced and its desired characteristics (Fig. 13.6), the user answers questions about how the application may take advantage of theunique capabilities of AM processes, as shown in Figs. 13.7 and13.8. In this version of the software, the questions ask about part shape similarity across the production volume, part geometric complexity, the extent of part consolidationcompared to a design for conventional manufacturing processes, and the partdelivery time. Based on the responses, the software responds with generalstatements about the likelihood of AM processes being suitable for the user’sapplication; for example, see the responses for the ﬁctitious problem fromFig.13.6. If the user is satisﬁed that his/her application is suitable for DDM, then they can proceed with a more quantitative exploration of AM machines. The AMSelect software enables the user to explore the capabilities of various AM machines for their application. As shown in Fig. 13.9, AMSelect ﬁrst segregates machines that appear to be feasible from those that are infeasible,based on material, surface ﬁnish, accuracy, and minimum feature size requirements.The user can select from both the sets of feasible and infeasible machines, whichcan be useful for comparison purposes. If the user wants to see the layout of parts in a machine’s build chamber, they can hit the Display button, while the machine of interest is selected. For example, the build chamber of an SLA ProX 950 machine is shown in Fig. 13.10 for parts with bounding box dimensions of 100 /C2100/C2100 mm (part size from Fig. 13.6). Since the ProX 950 has platform dimensions of 1,500 /C2550 mm, a total of 78 parts can ﬁt Fig. 13.6 Part Data entry screen for AMSelect13.4 Example System for Preliminary Selection 317on the platform with 10 mm spacing, as shown. The user has control over the spacing between parts. Entering negative spacing values effectively “nests” partswithin one another, which may be useful if parts are shaped like drinking cups, for example. Note that AMSelect will stack parts vertically if that is a typical build mode for the technology; parts are often fabricated in stacked layers in PBF as oneexample. Also note that serial manufacturing of end-use products is assumed for theAMSelect software. As such, the software assumes that a large quantity of partsmust be produced and ﬁlls the platform or build chamber with only one type of part(part described in the Part Data screen, Fig. 13.6). The user can also change the part orientation in an attempt to ﬁt additional parts into a build. In the last major step in AMSelect, the Assessment button (see Figs. 13.6,13.7 and13.9) can be selected to estimate the build time for the platform of parts, as well as the cost per part. These assessments can be particularly useful in comparingtechnologies and machines for an application. Considerable uncertainty existsregarding build speeds so ranges of build times are calculated based on typicalranges of scanning speeds, delay times, recoating speeds, etc. Part costs are brokendown into machine, material, operation, and maintenance costs, similar to the costmodel to be presented in Chap. 16. As shown in Fig. 13.11 , long build times do not necessarily translate to high part costs, particularly if many parts can be built at once. The SLA iPro 8000, SLS sPro 230, and the FDM Fortus 900mc have similar build times for a platform full ofparts, but part costs are several times smaller for the sPro 230, compared to the SLA Fig. 13.7 Qualitative assessment question screen318 13 Guidelines for Process SelectioniPro 8000, since many more parts can be built in about the same amount of time. On the other hand, the SLA Viper Si2 takes almost as long for its platform, but parts arevery expensive since the Viper is building in high-resolution mode (built-inassumption) and few parts can ﬁt on its relatively small platform. Maintenance of the database for AMSelect can be problematic, since machine capabilities may be upgraded, costs may be reduced, and new machines developed. AMSelect allows users to edit its database, either by modifying existing machines or by creating new ones. The screen that shows this capability is shown inFig.13.12 . Armed with these results, the user can make a selection of AM machines to explore further. The decision may be based on part cost. But, the user needs to takeall relevant information into account. Recall that the SinterStation machines werenot feasible for this application (due to feature size requirements, although this wasnot shown). This was why the SinterStation appeared in the infeasible column in Fig.13.9. With these results, the user can determine whether or not he/she wants to relax the feature size requirement to reduce costs, or maintain requirements with apotential cost penalty. Hence, trade-off scenarios can be explored with AMSelect. Fig. 13.8 Qualitative assessment results for the entries in Fig. 13.713.4 Example System for Preliminary Selection 319Fig. 13.9 Preliminary selection of machines to consider further Fig. 13.10 Layout of parts on the machine platform320 13 Guidelines for Process SelectionIn fact, a tool like AMSelect can be used by machine vendors to explore new product development. They can “create” new machines by adding a machine to the database with the characteristics of interest. Then, they can test their new machineby quantitatively comparing it with existing machines based on build times and partcosts. 13.5 Production Planning and Control This section addresses the third type of selection decision introduced in the Intro-duction, namely support for process planning. It is probably most relevant to theactivities of service bureaus (SBs), including internal organizations inmanufacturing companies that operate one or more AM machines and processes.The SB may know which machine and material a part is to be made from, but inmost circumstances, the part cannot be considered in isolation. When any new partis presented to the process planner at the SB, it is likely that he has alreadycommitted to build a number of parts. A decision support software system may be useful in keeping track and optimizing machine utilization. Consider the process when a new part is presented to the SB for building. In general, the information presented to the process planner will include the following: Fig. 13.11 Build time and cost results for the example13.5 Production Planning and Control 321 Part geometry  Number of parts Delivery date or schedule for batches of parts Processes other than AM to be carried out (pre-processing and post-processing) Expectations of the user (accuracy, degree of ﬁnish, etc.) Furnished with this small amount of data, it is possible to start integrating the new job with the existing jobs and available resources. Four topics will be explored further, namely production planning, pre-processing, part build, and post-processing. 13.5.1 Production Planning Several related decision are needed early in the process. A suitable AM process andmachine must be identiﬁed from among those in the facility. This was probablydone during the quoting stage before the customer selected the SB. After that issettled, AM machine availability must be considered. If the SB has more than onesuitable machine, a choice must be made as to which machine to use. If the job is fora series of part batches, the SB may choose to run all batches on the same machine, Fig. 13.12 Screen for adding or editing an AM machine deﬁnition322 13 Guidelines for Process Selectionor on multiple machines. If multiple machines, the SB must ensure that all selected machines can provide repeatable results, which is not always the case. Otherwise,potentially lengthy calibration builds may be needed to ensure consistent part quality from all machines used. A job scheduling system should be used, particularly for production manufacturing applications, so that part batches can be produced to meet deadlines.If the SB has insufﬁcient resources, it may need to invest in further capacity,necessitating a machine selection scenario. Alternatively, the SB could retain theservices of other SBs if the economics of further machine investments isquestionable. 13.5.2 Pre-processing Pre-processing means software-based manipulation. This will be carried out on theﬁle that describes the geometry of the part. Such manipulation can generally bedivided into two areas, modiﬁcation of the design and determination of buildparameters. Modiﬁcation of the design may be required for two reasons. First, part details may need adjustment to accommodate process characteristics. For example, shaft orpin diameters may need to be reduced, to increase clearance for assembly, when building in many processes since most processes are material safe (i.e., features become oversized). Second, models may require repair if the STEP, IGES, AMF, orSTL ﬁle has problems such as missing triangles, incorrectly oriented surfaces, orthe like. Determination of the build parameters is very speciﬁc to the AM process to be used. This includes selecting a part orientation, support generation, setting of buildstyles, layer thickness selection, and temperature setting. In general, this is either avery quick process or it takes a predictable length of time to set up. On occasion, and for some particular types of machine, this process can be very time consuming. This usually corresponds to instances when the user expectations closely meet theupper limits of the machine speciﬁcation (high accuracy, build strength, earlydelivery date, etc.). Under such conditions, the user must devote more time andattention to parameter setting. The decision support software should make theprocess planner aware under which circumstances this may occur and allocateresources appropriately. 13.5.3 Part Build For some processes, like material extrusion or LENS, it does not really matter interms of time whether parts are built one after another (batches of 1) or parts aregrouped together in batches. However, most processes will vary signiﬁcantlyregarding this factor. This may be due to signiﬁcant preparation time before thebuild process takes place (such as powder bed heating in PBF), or because there is a13.5 Production Planning and Control 323signiﬁcant delay between layers. In the latter case, it is obvious that the cumulative number of layers should be as low as possible to minimize the overall build time formany parts. Another factor is part orientation. It is well known that because of anisotropic properties caused by most AM processes, parts will generally build more effec-tively in one orientation compared with another. This can cause difﬁculties whenorganizing the batch production of parts. Orientation of parts so that they ﬁtefﬁciently within the work volume does not necessarily mean optimal build qualityand vice versa. For those machines that need to use support structures during thebuild process, this represents an additional problem, both in terms of build time(allocation of time to build the support structures for different orientations) and post-processing time (removing the supports). Many researchers have discussed these dilemmas [ 22]. What this generally means to a process planner is compromise. Compromise is not unusual to a process planner; in fact, it is a typical characteristic, but the degreeof ﬂexibility provided by many AM machines makes this a particularly interestingproblem. Just because an AM machine is being used constantly does not mean it isbeing used efﬁciently. 13.5.4 Post-processing All AM parts require a degree of post-processing. At the low end, this may requireremoval of support structures or excess powder for those who merely want quick,simple veriﬁcation. At the high end, the AM process may be a very insigniﬁcanttime overhead in the overall process. Parts may require a large amount of skilled manual work in terms of surface preparation and coating. Alternatively, the AM part may be one stage in a complex rapid tooling process that requires numerousmanual and automated stages. All this can result from the same source machine. Itcan even be an iterative process involving all of the above steps at different stages inthe development cycle based on the same part CAD data. 13.5.5 Summary It is clear that only process planners who have a very detailed understanding of allthe roles that AM parts can play will be able to utilize the resources effectively andefﬁciently. Even then it may be difﬁcult to perform this task reliably given the largenumber of variables involved. A software system to assist in this difﬁcult taskwould be a very valuable tool.324 13 Guidelines for Process Selection13.6 Open Problems Some summary statements and open problems that motivate continued research are presented here.  Selection methods and systems are only as good as the information that is utilized to make suggestions. Maintaining up to date and accurate machine andmaterial databases will likely be an ongoing problem. Centralized databases andstandard database and benchmarking practices will help to mitigate this issue.  Customers (people wanting parts made) have a wide range of intended applications and needs. A better representation of those needs is required inorder to facilitate better selection decisions. Improved methods for capturing andmodeling user preferences are also needed.  Related to the wide range of applications is the wide range of manufacturing process chains that could be used to construct parts. Better, more completemethods of generating, evaluating, and selecting process chains are needed forcases where multiple parts or products are needed (10–100) or when complexprototypes need to be constructed. An example of the latter case is a functionalprototype of a new product that consists of electronic and mechanicalsubsystems. Many options likely exist for fabricating individual parts ormodules.  More generally, integration of selection methods, with databases and process chain exploration methods would be very beneﬁcial.  Methods are needed that hide the complexity associated with the wide variety of process variables and nuances of AM technologies. This is particularly impor-tant for novice users of AM machines or even for knowledgeable users who workin production environments. Alternatively, knowledgeable users must haveaccess to all process variables if necessary to deal with difﬁcult builds.  Better methods are needed that enable users to explore trade-offs (compromises) among build goals and to ﬁnd machine settings that enable them to best meet their goals. These methods should work across the many different types of AMmachines and materials.  It is not uncommon for AM customers to want parts that are at the boundaries of AM machine capabilities. Tools that recognize when capability limits arereached or exceeded would be very helpful. Furthermore, these tools shouldprovide guidance that assists users in identifying process settings that are likelyto yield the best results. Providing estimates of part qualities (e.g., part detail actual sizes vs. desired sizes, actual surface ﬁnish vs. desired surface ﬁnish, etc.) would also be helpful.13.6 Open Problems 32513.7 Exercises You have been assigned to fabricate several prototypes of a cell phone housing for assembly and functional testing purposes.

ASME J Comput Inf Sci Eng 1(1):60–71References 327Post-processing14 14.1 Introduction Most AM processes require post-processing after part building to prepare the part for its intended form, ﬁt and/or function. Depending upon the AM technique, the reason for post-processing varies. For purposes of simplicity, this chapter will focus on post-processing techniques which are used to enhance components or overcomeAM limitations. These include: Support material removal Surface texture improvements3. Accuracy improvements4. Aesthetic improvements Preparation for use as a pattern Property enhancements using non-thermal techniques7. Property enhancements using thermal techniques The skill with which various AM practitioners perform post-processing is one of the most distinguishing characteristics between competing service providers.Companies which can efﬁciently and accurately post-process parts to a customer’sexpectations can often charge a premium for their services; whereas, companies which compete primarily on price may sacriﬁce post-processing quality in order to reduce costs. 14.2 Support Material Removal The most common type of post-processing in AM is support removal. Supportmaterial can be broadly classiﬁed into two categories: (a) material which surrounds the part as a naturally occurring by-product of the build process (natural supports), #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_14329and (b) rigid structures which are designed and built to support, restrain, or attach the part being built to a build platform (synthetic supports). 14.2.1 Natural Support Post-processing In processes where the part being built is fully encapsulated in the build material, the part must be removed from the surrounding material prior to its use. Processes which provide natural supports are primarily powder-based and sheet-based pro-cesses. Speciﬁcally, all powder bed fusion (PBF) and binder jetting processesrequire removal of the part from the loose powder surrounding the part; andbond-then-form sheet metal lamination processes require removal of theencapsulating sheet material. In polymer PBF processes, after the part is built it is typically necessary to allow the part to go through a cool-down stage. The part should remain embedded inside the powder to minimize part distortion due to nonuniform cooling. The cool-down time is dependent on the build material and the size of the part(s). Once cool-downis complete, there are several methods used to remove the part(s) from thesurrounding loose powder. Typically, the entire build (made up of loose powderand fused parts) is removed from the machine as a block and transported to a“breakout” station where the parts are removed manually from the surroundingpowdered material. Brushes, compressed air, and light bead blasting are commonlyused to remove loosely adhered powder; whereas, wood-working tools and dental cleaning tools are commonly used to remove powders which have sintered to the surface or powder entrapped in small channels or features. Internal cavities andhollow spaces can be difﬁcult to clean and may require signiﬁcant post-processing time. With the exception of an extended cool-down time, natural support removal techniques for binder jetting processes are identical to those used for PBF. In mostcases, parts made using binder jetting are brittle out of the machine. Thus, until theparts have been strengthened by inﬁltration the parts must be handled with care. This is also true for PBF materials that require post-inﬁltration, such as some elastomeric materials, polystyrene materials for investment casting, and metaland ceramic green parts. More recently, automated loose powder removal processes have been devel- oped. These can be stand-alone apparatuses or integrated into the build chamber.One of the ﬁrst ZCorp (now 3D Systems) binder jetting machines with thiscapability is illustrated in Fig. 14.1. Several metal PBF machine manufacturers have started to integrate semi-automated powder removal techniques into their machines as well. Current trends suggest that many future PBF and binder jetting machines will incorporate some form of automated powder removal after partcompletion. Bond-then-form sheet lamination processes, such as Mcor’s machines, also require natural support material removal prior to use. If complex geometries withoverhanging features, internal cavities, channels or ﬁne features are used, the330 14 Post-processingsupport removal may be tedious and time-consuming. If enclosed cavities or channels are created, it is often necessary to delaminate the model at a speciﬁc z- height in order to gain access to de-cube the internal feature; and then re-glue it after removing excess support materials. An example of de-cubing operation for LOM is shown in Fig. 14.2. 14.2.2 Synthetic Support Removal Processes which do not naturally support parts require synthetic supports for overhanging features. In some cases, such as when using PBF techniques for metals, synthetic supports are also required to resist distortion. Synthetic supports can be made from the build material or from a secondary material. The develop- ment of secondary support materials was a key step in simplifying the removal of Fig. 14.1 Automated powder removal using vibratory and vacuum assist in a ZCorp 450 machine (Courtesy Z Corporation) Fig. 14.2 LOM support removal process (de-cubing), showing: ( a) the ﬁnished block of material; (b) removal of cubes far from the part; ( c) removal of cubes directly adjacent to the part; ( d) the ﬁnished product (Courtesy Worldwide Guide to Rapid Prototyping web site #Copyright Castle Island Co., All rights reserved. Photo provided by Cubic Technologies.)14.2 Support Material Removal 331synthetic supports as these materials are designed to be either weaker, soluble in a liquid solution, or to melt at a lower temperature than the build material. The orientation of a part with respect to the primary build axis signiﬁcantly affects support generation and removal. If a thin part is laid ﬂat, for instance, theamount of support material consumed may signiﬁcantly exceed the amount of buildmaterial (see Fig. 14.3). The orientation of supports also affects the surface ﬁnish of the part, as support removal typically leaves “witness marks” (small bumps ordivots) where the supports were attached. Additionally, the use of supports inregions of small features may lead to these features being broken when the supportsare removed. Thus, orientation and location of supports is a key factor for many processes to achieve desirable ﬁnished part characteristics. 14.2.2.1 Supports Made from the Build Material All material extrusion, material jetting, and vat photopolymerization processes require supports for overhanging structures and to connect the part to the buildplatform. Since these processes are used primarily for polymer parts, the lowstrength of the supports allows them to be removed manually. These types of supports are also commonly referred to as breakaway supports. The removal of supports from downward-facing features leaves witness marks where the supportswere attached. As a result, these surfaces may require subsequent sanding andpolishing. Figure 14.4 shows breakaway support removal techniques for parts made using material extrusion and vat photopolymerization techniques. PBF and DED processes for metals and ceramics also typically require support materials. An example of dental framework, oriented so that support removal doesnot mar the critical surfaces, is shown in Fig. 14.5. For these processes the metal supports are often too strong to be removed by hand; thus, the use of milling, band- saws, cut-off blades, wire-EDM, and other metal cutting techniques are widelyemployed. As discussed in Chap. 5, parts made using electron beam melting have fewer supports than those made using metal laser sintering, since EBM holds thepart at elevated temperature throughout the build process and less residual stressesare induced.

Design byNathan Yo Han Wheatley.)332 14 Post-processing14.2.2.2 Supports Made from Secondary Materials A number of secondary support materials have been developed over the years in order to alleviate the labor-intensive manual removal of support materials. Two of the ﬁrst technologies to use secondary support materials were the Cubital layer- wise vat photopolymerization process and the Solidscape material jetting process. Their use of wax support materials enabled the block of support/build to be placed in a warm water bath; thus, melting or dissolving the wax yields the ﬁnal parts.

Photo provided by Cadem A.S., Turkey)14.2 Support Material Removal 333Since that time, secondary supports have become common commercially in mate- rial extrusion (Fig. 14.3) and material jetting processes. Secondary supports have also been demonstrated for form-then-bond sheet metal lamination and DED processes in research environments. For polymers, the most common secondary support materials are polymer materials which can be melted and/or dissolved in a water-based solvent. Thewater can be jetted or ultrasonically vibrated to accelerate the support removalprocess. For metals, the most common secondary support materials are lower-melting-temperature alloys or alloys which can be chemically dissolved in a solvent(in this case the solvent must not affect the build material). 14.3 Surface Texture Improvements AM parts have common surface texture features that may need to be modiﬁed foraesthetic or performance reasons. Common undesirable surface texture featuresinclude: stair-steps, powder adhesion, ﬁll patterns from material extrusion or DEDsystems, and witness marks from support material removal. Stair-stepping is afundamental issue in layered manufacturing, although one can choose a thin layerthickness to minimize error at the expense of build time. Powder adhesion is afundamental characteristic of binder jetting, PBF, and powder-based DED pro- cesses. The amount of powder adhesion can be controlled, to some degree, by changing part orientation, powder morphology, and thermal control technique (suchas modifying the scan pattern). The type of post-processing utilized for surface texture improvements is depen- dent upon the desired surface ﬁnish outcome. If a matte surface ﬁnish is desired, asimple bead blasting of the surface can help even the surface texture, remove sharpcorners from stair-stepping, and give an overall matte appearance. If a smooth orpolished ﬁnish is desired, then wet or dry sanding and hand-polishing are performed. In many cases, it is desirable to paint the surface (e.g., with cyanoacry- late, or a sealant) prior to sanding or polishing. Painting the surface has the dualbeneﬁt of sealing porosity and, by viscous forces, smoothing the stair-step effect,thus making sanding and polishing easier and more effective. Several automated techniques have been explored for surface texture improvements. Two of the most commonly utilized include tumbling for externalfeatures and abrasive ﬂow machining for, primarily, internal features. These pro-cesses have been shown to smooth surface features nicely, but at the cost of small feature resolution, sharp corner retention, and accuracy. 14.4 Accuracy Improvements There is a wide range of accuracy capabilities between AM processes. Some processes are capable of submicron tolerances, whereas others have accuraciesaround 1 mm. Typically, the larger the build volume and the faster the build334 14 Post-processingspeed the worse the accuracy. This is particularly noticeable, for instance, in directed energy deposition processes where the slowest and most accurate DEDprocesses have accuracies approaching a few microns; whereas, the larger bulk deposition machines have accuracies of several millimeters. 14.4.1 Sources of Inaccuracy Process-dependent errors affect the accuracy of the X–Yplane differently from the Z-axis accuracy. These errors come from positioning and indexing limitations of speciﬁc machine architectures, lack of closed-loop process monitoring and controlstrategies, and/or from issues fundamental to the volumetric rate of materialaddition (such as melt pool or droplet size). In addition, for many processes, accuracy is highly dependent upon operator skill. Future accuracy improvements in AM will require fully automatic real-time control strategies to monitor andcontrol the process, rather than the need to rely on expert operators as a feedbackmechanism. Integration of additive plus subtractive processing is another methodfor process accuracy improvement. Material-dependent phenomena also play a role in accuracy, including shrinkage and residual stress-induced distortion. Repeatable shrinkage and distortion can becompensated by scaling the CAD model; however, predictive capabilities at present are not accurate enough to fully understand and compensate for variations in shrinkage and residual stresses that are scan pattern or geometry dependent. Quan-titative understanding of the effects of process parameters, build style, part orienta-tion, support structures, and other factors on the magnitude of shrinkage, residualstress, and distortion is necessary to enhance these predictive capabilities. In themeantime, for parts which require a high degree of accuracy, extra material must beadded to critical features, which is then removed via milling or other subtractivemeans to achieve the desired accuracy. In order to meet the needs of applications where the beneﬁts of AM are desired with the accuracy of a CNC machined component, a comprehensive strategy forachieving this accuracy can be adopted. One such strategy involves pre-processingof the STL ﬁle to compensate for inaccuracies followed by ﬁnish machining of theﬁnal part. The following sections describe steps to consider when seeking toestablish a comprehensive ﬁnish machining strategy. 14.4.2 Model Pre-processing to Compensate for Inaccuracy For many AM processes, the position of the part within the build chamber and theorientation will inﬂuence part accuracy, surface ﬁnish, and build time. Thus,translation and rotation operations are applied to the original model to optimizethe part position and orientation. Shrinkage often occurs during AM. Shrinkage also occurs during the post- process furnace operations needed for indirect processing of metal or ceramic14.4 Accuracy Improvements 335green parts. Pre-process manipulation of the STL model will allow a scale factor to be used to compensate for the average shrinkage of the process chain. However,when compensating for average shrinkage, there will always be some features which shrink slightly more or less than the average (shrinkage variation). In order to compensate for shrinkage variation, if the highest shrinkage value is used then ribs and similar features will always be at least as big as the desiredgeometry. However, channels and holes will be too large. Thus, simply using thelargest shrinkage value is not an acceptable solution. In order to make sure that there is enough material left on the surface to be machined, adding “skin” to the original model is necessary. This skin addition, suchthat there is material left to machine everywhere, can be referred to as making the part “steel-safe.” Many studies have shown that shrinkage variations are geometry dependent, even when using the same AM or furnace post-processing parameters.Thus, compensating for shrinkage variation requires offsetting of the original modelto guarantee that even the features with the largest shrinkage levels and all channelsand holes are steel-safe. There are two primary methods for adding a skin to the surface of a part. The ﬁrst is to offset the surfaces and then recalculate all of the surface intersections. Thismethodology, though the most common, has many drawbacks for STL ﬁles made up of triangular facets. In answer to these drawbacks, an algorithm developed for offsetting all of the individual vertices of an STL ﬁle by using the normal vectorinformation for the connected triangles, then reconstructing the triangles by usingnew vertex values, has been developed [ 2]. See Chap. 15for more information on STL ﬁles and software systems to manipulate them. In an STL ﬁle, each vertex is typically shared by several triangles whose unit normal vectors are different. When offsetting the vertices of a model, the new valueof each vertex is determined by the unit normal values of its connected triangles. Suppose Voffsetis the unit vector from the original position to the new position of the vertex which is to be moved, and N1,N2,...Nnare the unit normal vectors of the triangles which share that vertex; Voffsetcan be calculated by the weighted mean of those unit normal vectors, Voffset¼Xn i¼1WiNi ð14:1Þ where Wiare coefﬁcients whose values are determined to satisfy the equation, Voffset/C1N¼1i¼1, 2, ...n ðÞ ð 14:2Þ After solving for Voffset ;the new position Pnewof the vertex is given by the equation, Pnew¼Porignal þVoffset∗doffset ð14:3Þ where doffset is the offset dimension set by the user.336 14 Post-processingThe above procedure is repeated until the new position values for all vertices are calculated. The model is then reconstructed using the new triangle information. Thus, to use this offset methodology, one need to only enter a doffset value that is the same as the largest shrinkage variation anticipated. In practical terms, doffset should be set equal to 2 or 3 times the absolute standard deviation of shrinkage measured for a particular machine/material combination. 14.4.3 Machining Strategy Machining strategy is very important for ﬁnishing AM parts and tools. Consideringboth accuracy and machine efﬁciency, adaptive raster milling of the surface, plushole drilling and sharp edge contour machining can fulﬁll the needs of most parts. 14.4.3.1 Adaptive Raster Milling When raster machining is used for milling operations, stepover distance between adjacent toolpaths is a very important parameter that controls the machining accuracy and surface quality. It is known that higher accuracy and surface qualityrequire a smaller stepover distance. Normally, the cusp height of material left afterthe model is machined is used as a measurement of the surface quality. Figure 14.6 shows a triangle face being machined with a ball endmill. The relationship between cusp height h, cutter radius r, stepover distance d, and incline angle αis given in the following equation: d¼2:0ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ r 2/C0r/C0hðÞ2q cosα ð14:4Þ αis determined by the triangle surface normal and stepover direction. Suppose Ntriangle is the unit normal vector of the triangle surface, and NStepover is the unit vector along stepover direction, thenαdrhlFig. 14.6 Illustration for determining stepover distance (#Emerald Group Publishing Limited) [ 3]14.4 Accuracy Improvements 337cosπ 2/C0α/C16/C17 ¼sinα¼NTriangle /C1NStepover/C12/C12/C12/C12 ð14:5Þ From ( 14.4) and ( 14.5), the following equation for stepover distance is derived, d¼2:0ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ h2r/C0h ðÞ 1/C0NTriangle /C1NStepover/C0/C12/C16/C17r ð14:6Þ When machining the model, the cutter radius and milling direction are the same for all triangle surfaces. If given the user-set maximum cusp height h,dis only related to the triangle normal vector. For surfaces with different normal vectors, the stepover distance obtained will be different. If using a constant stepover distance, in order to guarantee a particular machin- ing tolerance, the minimum calculated dshould be used for the entire part. How- ever, using the minimum stepover distances will lead to longer programs andmachining times. Therefore, an adaptive stepover distance for milling operationsaccording to local geometry should be used to allow for both accuracy and machineefﬁciency. This means that stepover distances are calculated dynamically for eachjust-ﬁnished tool pass, using the maximum cusp height to determine the stepover distance for the next tool pass. An example of the use of this type of algorithm for tool-path generation is shown in Fig. 14.7. As can be seen, for tool paths which pass through a region of high angle, the tools paths are more closely spaced; whereas, for toolpaths that only crossrelatively ﬂat regions, the tool paths are widely spaced. 14.4.3.2 Sharp Edge Contour Machining Sharp edges are often the intersection curves between features and surfaces. Normally, these edges deﬁne the critical dimensions. When using raster milling, the edges parallel to the milling direction can be missed, causing large errors. Asshown in Fig. 14.8, when a stepover distance dis used to machine a part with slot width W, even when the CNC machine is perfectly aligned (i.e., ignoring machine positioning errors), the slot width error will be at least, W error¼2d/C0δ1/C0δ2 ð14:6Þ where δ1,δ2represent the offset between the actual and desired edge location. When δ1,δ2become 0, Werror¼2d. This means that the possible maximum error for a slot using raster milling is approximately two times the stepover distance. For complicated edges not parallel to the milling direction, raster milling is ineffective for creating smooth edges, as the edge will have a stair-step appearance, with the step size equal to the local stepover distance, d. Thus, after raster milling, it is advantageous to run a machining pass along the sharp edges (contours) of the part[3]. In order to machine along sharp edges, all sharp edges must ﬁrst be identiﬁed from the STL model. The normal vector information of each triangle is used tocheck the property of an edge. The angle between normal vectors of two338 14 Post-processingneighboring triangles is calculated. If this angle is larger than a user-speciﬁed angle, the edge shared by these two triangles will be marked as a sharp edge. All triangle edges are checked this way to generate a sharp edge list. Hidden edges and redundant tool paths are eliminated before tool paths are calculated. By offsettingthe edges by the cutter radius, the x,ylocation of the endmill is obtained.

Using this approach, sharp edges can be identiﬁed and easily ﬁnish machined. Figure 14.9 shows the part from Fig. 14.7 with sharp edge contour paths highlighted. 14.4.3.3 Hole Drilling Circular holes are common features in parts and tools. Using milling tools to create holes is inefﬁcient and the circularity of the holes is poor. Therefore, a machining strategy of identifying and drilling holes is preferable. The most challenging aspect is to recognize holes in an STL or AMF ﬁle, as the 3D geometry is represented by a collection of unordered triangular planar facets (and thus all feature information is lost). The intersection curve between a hole and a surface is typically a closed loop. By using this information, a hole recognition algorithm begins by identifying all closed Fig. 14.8 Inﬂuence of stepover distance on dimensional accuracy ( # Emerald Group Publishing Limited) [ 3] Fig. 14.9 Sharp edge contours identiﬁed for milling340 14 Post-processingloops made up of sharp edges from the model. These closed loops may not necessarily be the intersection curves between holes and a surface, so a series ofhole-checking rules are used to remove the loops that do not correspond to drilled holes. The remaining loops and their surface normal vectors are used to determine the diameter, axis orientation, and depth for drilling. From this information, toolpaths can be automatically generated [ 3]. Thus, by pre-processing an STL ﬁle using a shrinkage and surface offset value, and then post-processing the part using adaptive raster milling, contour machining,and hole drilling, an accurate part can be made. In many cases, however, this type ofcomprehensive strategy is not necessary. For instance, for a complex part whereonly one or two features must be made accurately, the part could be pre-processed using the average shrinkage value as a scaling factor and a skin can be added only to the critical features. These critical features could then be manually machined afterAM part creation, leaving the other features as is. Thus, the ﬁnish machiningstrategy adopted will depend greatly upon the application and part-speciﬁc designrequirements. 14.5 Aesthetic Improvements Many times AM is used to make parts which will be displayed for aesthetic orartistic reasons or used as marketing tools. In these and similar instances, theaesthetics of the part is of critical importance for its end application. Often the desired aesthetic improvement is solely related to surface ﬁnish. In this case, the post-processing options discussed in Sect. 14.2 can be used. In some cases, a difference in surface texture between one region and another may be desired (thisis often the case in jewelry). In this case, ﬁnishing of selected surfaces only is required (such as for the cover art for this book). In cases where the color of the AM part is not of sufﬁcient quality, several methods can be used to improve the part aesthetics. Some types of AM parts can beeffectively colored by simply dipping the part into a dye of the appropriate color.This method is particularly effective for parts created from powder beds, as theinherent porosity in these parts leads to effective absorption. If painting is required,the part may need to be sealed prior to painting. Common automotive paints arequite effective in these instances. Another aesthetic enhancement (which also strengthens the part and improves wear resistance) is chrome plating. Figure 14.10 shows a stereolithography part before and after chrome plating. Several materials have been electroless coated toAM parts, including Ni, Cu, and other coatings. In some cases, these coatings arethick enough that, in addition to aesthetic improvements, the parts are robustenough to use as tools for injection molding or as EDM electrodes.14.5 Aesthetic Improvements 34114.6 Preparation for Use as a Pattern Often parts made using AM are intended as patterns for investment casting, sand casting, room temperature vulcanization (RTV) molding, spray metal deposition, or other pattern replication processes. In many cases, the use of an AM pattern in acasting process is the least expensive way to use AM to produce a metal part, asmany of the metal-based AM processes are still expensive to own and operate. The accuracy and surface ﬁnish of an AM pattern will directly inﬂuence the ﬁnal part accuracy and surface ﬁnish. As a result, special care must be taken to ensure thepattern has the accuracy and surface ﬁnish desired in the ﬁnal part. In addition, thepattern must be scaled to compensate for any shrinkage that takes place in the pattern replication steps. 14.6.1 Investment Casting Patterns In the case of investment casting, the AM pattern will be consumed duringprocessing. In this instance, residue left in the mold as the pattern is melted or burned out is undesirable. Any sealants used to smooth the surface during patternpreparation should be carefully chosen so as not to inadvertently create unwantedresidue. AM parts can be printed on a casting tree or manually added to a casting tree after AM. Figure 14.11 shows rings made using a material jetting system. In the ﬁrst Fig. 14.10 Stereolithography part ( a) before and ( b) after chrome plating (Courtesy of Artcraft Plating)342 14 Post-processingpicture, a collection of rings is shown on the build platform; each ring is supported by a secondary support material in white. In the second picture, a close-up of the ring pattern is shown. The third picture shows metal rings still attached to a casting tree. In this instance, the rings were added to the tree after AM, but before casting. When using the stereolithography Quickcast build style, the hollow, truss-ﬁlled shell patterns must be drained of liquid prior to investment. The hole(s) used fordraining must be covered to avoid investment entering the interior of the pattern.Since photopolymer materials are thermosets, they must be burned out of theinvestment rather than melted. When powdered materials are used as investment casting patterns, such as polystyrene from a polymer laser sintering process or starch from a binder jetting process, the resulting part is porous and brittle. In order to seal the part andstrengthen it for the investment process, the part is inﬁltrated with an investmentcasting wax prior to investment. 14.6.2 Sand Casting Patterns Both binder jetting and PBF processes can be used to directly create sand mold cores and cavities by using a thermosetting binder to bind sand in the desired shape. One beneﬁt of these direct approaches is that complex-geometry cores can be madethat would be very difﬁcult to fabricate using any other process, as illustrated inFig.14.12 . In order to prepare AM sand casting patterns for casting, loose powder is removed and the pattern is heated to complete cross-linking of the thermoset binderand to remove moisture and gaseous by-products. In some cases, additional bindersare added to the pattern before heating, to increase the strength for handling. Once the pattern is thermally treated, it is assembled with its corresponding core(s) and/or cavity, and hot metal is poured into the mold. After cooling, the sand pattern isremoved using tools and bead blasting. In addition to directly producing sand casting cores and cavities, AM can be used to create parts which are used in place of the typical wooden or metal patternsaround which a sand casting mold is created. In this case, the AM part is built as one Fig. 14.11 Rings for investment casting, made using a ProJet®CPX 3D Printer (Courtesy 3D Systems)14.6 Preparation for Use as a Pattern 343or more portions of the part to be cast, split along the parting line. The split part is placed in a box, sand mixed with binder is poured around the part, and the sand iscompressed (pounded) so that the binder holds the sand together. The box is thendisassembled, the sand mold is removed from the box, and the pattern is removedfrom the mold. The mold is then reassembled with its complementary mold half andcore(s) and molten metal is poured into the mold. 14.6.3 Other Pattern Replication Methods There are many pattern replication methods which have been utilized since the late1980s to transform the weak “rapid prototypes” of those days into parts with usefulmaterial properties. As the number of AM technologies has increased and the durability of the materials that they can produce has improved substantially, these replication processes are ﬁnding less use, as people prefer to directly produce ausable part if possible. However, even with the multiplication of AM technologiesand materials, pattern replication processes are widely used among service bureausand companies who need parts from a speciﬁc material that is not directly process-able in AM. Probably, the most common pattern replication methods are RTV molding or silicone rubber molding. In RTV molding, as shown in Fig. 14.13 , the AM pattern is given visual markers (such as by using colored tape) to illustrate the parting line locations for mold disassembly; runners, risers, and gates are added; the model issuspended in a mold box; and a rubber-like material is poured around the model toencapsulate it. After cross-linking, the solid translucent rubber mold is removedfrom the mold box, a knife is used to cut the rubber mold into pieces according tothe parting line markers, and the pattern is removed from the mold. In order to Fig. 14.12 Sand casting pattern for a cylinder head of a V6, 24-valve car engine ( left) during loose powder removal and ( right ) pattern prepared for casting alongside a ﬁnished casting (Joint project between CADCAM Becker GmbH and VAW Su ¨dalumin GmbH, made on an EOSINT S laser-sintering machine, courtesy EOS)344 14 Post-processingcomplete the replication process the mold is reassembled and held together in a box or by placing rubber bands around the mold and molten material is poured into themold and allowed to solidify. After solidiﬁcation, the mold is opened, the part is removed and the process is repeated until a sufﬁcient number of parts are made. Using this process, a single pattern can be used to make 10s or 100s of identicalparts. If the part being made in the RTV mold is a wax pattern, it can subsequently be used in an investment or plaster casting process to produce a metal part. Thus, bycombining RTV molding and investment casting, one AM pattern can be replicatedinto a large number of metal parts for a relatively modest cost. Metal spray processes have also been used to replicate geometry from an AM part into a metal part. In the case of metal spray, only one side of the pattern is replicated into the metal part. This is most often used for tooling or parts where oneside contains all the geometric complexity and the rest of the tool or part is made upof ﬂat edges. Using spray metal or electroless deposition processes, an AM patterncan be replicated to form an injection molding core or cavity, which can then beused to mold other parts. 14.7 Property Enhancements Using Non-thermal Techniques Powder-based and extrusion-based processes often create porous structures. Inmany cases, that porosity can be inﬁltrated by a higher-strength material, such ascyanoacrylate (Super Glue ®). Proprietary methods and materials have also been developed to increase the strength, ductility, heat deﬂection, ﬂammability resis-tance, EMI shielding, or other properties of AM parts using inﬁltrants and various types of nano-composite reinforcements. A common post-processing operation for photopolymer materials is curing. During processing, many photopolymers do not achieve complete polymerization.As a result, these parts are put into a Post-Cure Apparatus, a device that ﬂoods thepart with UV and visible radiation in order to completely cure the surface andsubsurface regions of the part. Additionally, the part can undergo a thermal cure in a Fig. 14.13 RTV molding process steps (Courtesy MTT Technologies Group)14.7 Property Enhancements Using Non-thermal Techniques 345low temperature oven, which can help completely cure the photopolymer and in some cases greatly enhance the part’s mechanical properties. 14.8 Property Enhancements Using Thermal Techniques After AM processing, many parts are thermally processed to enhance theirproperties. In the case of DED and PBF techniques for metals, this thermalprocessing is primarily heat treatment to form the desired microstructures and/orto relieve residual stresses. In these instances, traditional recipes for heat treatmentdeveloped for the speciﬁc metal alloy being employed are often used. In somecases, however, special heat treatment methods have been developed to retain the ﬁne-grained microstructure within the AM part while still providing stress relief and ductility enhancement. Before the advent of DED and PBF techniques capable of directly processing metals and ceramics, many techniques were developed for creating metal andceramic green parts using AM. These were then furnace post-processed to achievedense, usable metal and ceramic parts. Binder jetting is the only AM process whichis commonly used for these purposes. The basic approach to furnace processing ofgreen parts was illustrated in Fig. 5.7. In order to prepare a green part for furnace processing, several preparatory steps are typically done. Figure 14.14 shows the steps for preparing a metal green part made from LaserForm ST-100 for furnaceinﬁltration. Figure 14.15 shows an injection molding tool made from an ExOne binder jetting process after furnace debinding, sintering, and inﬁltration (same asFig. 8.5). The use of cooling channels which follow the contours of the surface (conformal cooling channels) in an injection mold has been shown to signiﬁcantly Fig. 14.14 LaserForm ST-100 green parts. ( a) Parts are placed next to “boats” on which the bronze inﬁltrant is placed. The bronze inﬁltrates through the boat into the part. ( b) The parts are often covered in aluminum oxide powder before placing them in a furnace to help support fragile features during debinding, sintering, and inﬁltration, and to help minimize thermal gradients346 14 Post-processingincrease the productivity of injection mold tooling by decreasing the cooling time and part distortion. Thus, the appropriate use of conformal cooling channels enables many companies to utilize AM-produced tools to increase their productivity. Control of shrinkage and dimensional accuracy during furnace processing is complicated by the number of process parameters that must be optimized and themultiple steps involved. Figure 14.16 illustrates the complicated nature of optimi- zation for this type of furnace processing. The y-axis, ( F1–F2)/F1 represents the dimensional changes during the ﬁnal furnace stage of inﬁltration of stainless steel(RapidSteel 2.0) parts using bronze. F1 is the dimension of the brown part before inﬁltration and F2 is the dimension after inﬁltration. The data represent thousands of measurements across both internal (channel-like) and external (rib-like) featuresranging from 0.3 to 3.0 in. Although many factors were studied, only two werefound to be statistically signiﬁcant for the inﬁltration step, atmospheric pressure inthe furnace, and inﬁltrant amount. The atmospheric pressure ranged between 10 and800 Torr. The amount of inﬁltrant used ranged from a low of 85 % to a high of Fig. 14.15 Cross-section of a ExOne ProMetal injection molding tool showing CAD ﬁles and ﬁnished, inﬁltrated component with internal conformal cooling channels (Courtesy ProMetal LLC, an ExOne Company)14.8 Property Enhancements Using Thermal Techniques 347110 %, where the percentage amount was based upon the theoretical amount of material needed to fully ﬁll all of the porosity in the part, based upon measurementsof the weight and the volume of the part just prior to inﬁltration. It can be seen from Fig. 14.16 that the factor combinations with the lowest overall shrinkage were not the factors with the lowest shrinkage variation. Factorcombination A had the lowest average shrinkage, while factor combination E hadthe lowest shrinkage variation. As average shrinkage can be easily compensated using a scaling factor, the optimum factor combination for highest accuracy and precision would be factor combination E. If the accuracy strategy discussed inSect. 14.3 is followed, the skin offset d offset would be determined by identifying the shrinkage variation for the entire process (green part fabrication using AM, plussintering and inﬁltration) using a similar approach and then setting d offset equal to the maximum shrinkage variation at the desired conﬁdence interval. In addition to the thermal processes discussed earlier, a number of other procedures have been developed over the years to combine AM with furnace processing to produce metal or ceramic parts. One example approach utilized laser sintering to produce porous parts with gas impermeable skins. By scanning only theoutside contours of a part during fabrication by SLS, a metal “can” ﬁlled with loosepowder is made. These parts are then post-processed to full density using hotisostatic pressing (HIP). This in situ encapsulation results in no adverse container–powder interactions (as they are made from the same bed of powder), reducedpre-processing time, and fewer post-processing steps compared to conventionalHIP of canned parts. The SLS/HIP approach was successfully used to produce complex 3D parts in Inconel 625 and Ti–6Al–4 V for aerospace applications [ 4]. Laser sintering has also been used to produce complex-shaped ZrB 2/Cu com- posite EDM electrodes. The approach involved (a) fabrication of a green part frompolymer coated ZrB 2powder using the laser sintering, (b) debinding and sintering of the ZrB 2, and (c) inﬁltration of the sintered, porous ZrB 2with liquid copper. This manufacturing route was found to result in a more homogeneous structure com-pared to a hot pressing route.

Effective utilization of AM processes requires not only a knowledgeof AM process beneﬁts and limitations, but also of the requisite post-processing operations necessary to ﬁnalize the part for use. When considering the intended form, ﬁt and function for an AM-produced part, post-processing is typically required. To achieve the correct form, support materialremoval, surface texture improvements, and aesthetic improvements are commonlyrequired. To achieve the correct ﬁt, accuracy improvements, typically via milling,are commonly required. To achieve the correct function, the AM part may requirepreparation for use as a pattern, property enhancements using non-thermaltechniques, or property enhancements using thermal techniques. Whether using automated secondary support material removal, labor-intensive de-cubing, high- temperature furnace processing, or secondary machining, choosing and properlyimplementing the best AM process, material and post-processing combination forthe intended application is critical to success. 14.10 Exercises What are the key material property considerations when selecting a secondary support material for material jetting and material extrusion? Would theseconsiderations change when considering supporting metals deposited using adirected energy deposition process? What are the primary beneﬁts and drawbacks when offsetting triangle surfaces versus triangle vertices? (Note: You will need to ﬁnd this information by ﬁndingand reading a relevant paper, as the details are not in this chapter.) Which approach would be better for freeform surfaces, such as the hood of a car or the proﬁle of a face? Assuming that the total shrinkage in an AM process is represented by Fig. 14.16 , what shrinkage value and what surface offset value would you choose forpre-processing a model for each of the Factors A–F? Why is contour milling beneﬁcial for parts if adaptive raster milling ensures that all cusp heights are within acceptable values? In AM processes often a larger shrinkage value is found in the X–Yplane than in theZdirection before post-processing. Why might this be the case?14.10 Exercises 349References Bibb R, Eggbeer D, Williams R (2006) Rapid manufacture of removable partial denture frameworks.

In particular we will discuss the STL ﬁle formatthat is commonly used by many of the machines to describe the model inputdata. These ﬁles are manipulated in a number of machine-speciﬁc ways to createslice data and for support generation and the basic principles are covered here including some discussion on common errors and other software that can assist with STL ﬁles. Finally, we consider some of the limitations of the STL formatand how it may be replaced by something more suitable in the future like thenewly developed Additive Manufacturing File format. 15.1 Introduction It is clear that additive manufacturing would not exist without computers and wouldnot have developed so far if it were not for the development of 3D solid modelingCAD. The quality, reliability, and ease of use of 3D CAD have meant that virtuallyany geometry can be modeled, and it has enhanced our ability to design. Some ofthe most impressive models made using AM are those that demonstrate the capacityto fabricate complex forms in a single stage without the need to assemble or to use secondary tooling. As mentioned in Chap. 1, the WYSIWYB (What You See Is What You Build) capability allows users to consider the design with fewer concernsover how it can be built. Virtually every commercial solid modeling CAD system has the ability to output to an AM machine. This is because, for most cases, the only information that an AMmachine requires from the CAD system is the external geometric form. There is norequirement for the machine to know how the part was modeled, any of the featuresor any functional elements. So long as the external geometry can be deﬁned, the part can be built. #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_15351This chapter will describe the fundamentals for creating output ﬁles for AM. It will discuss the most common technique, which is to create the STL ﬁle format,explaining how it works and typical problems associated with it. Some of the numerous software tools for use with AM will be described and possible effects of new concepts in AM on the development of associated software tools in thefuture will be discussed. Finally, there will be a discussion concerning the AdditiveManufacturing File (AMF) format, which has been developed to address the needsof future AM technology where more than just the geometric information may berequired. 15.2 Preparation of CAD Models: The STL File The STL ﬁle is derived from the word STereoLithography, which was the ﬁrstcommercial AM process, produced by the US company 3D Systems in the late1980s [ 1], although some have suggested that STL should stand for Stereolithography Tessellation Language. STL ﬁles are generated from 3D CADdata within the CAD system. The output is a boundary representation that isapproximated by a mesh of triangles. 15.2.1 STL File Format, Binary/ASCII STL ﬁles can be output as either binary or ASCII (text) format. The ASCII format isless common (due to the larger ﬁle sizes) but easier to understand and is generallyused for illustration and teaching. Most AM systems run on PCs using Windows.The STL ﬁle is normally labeled with a “.STL” extension that is case insensitive,although some AM systems may require a different or more speciﬁc ﬁle deﬁnition.These ﬁles only show approximations of the surface or solid entities and so anyinformation concerning the color, material, build layers, or history is ignored duringthe conversion process. Furthermore, any points, lines, or curves used during the construction of the surface or solid, and not explicitly used in that solid or surface, will also be ignored. An STL ﬁle consists of lists of triangular facets. Each triangular facet is uniquely identiﬁed by a unit normal vector and three vertices or corners. The unit normalvector is a line that is perpendicular to the triangle and has a length equal to 1.0.This unit length could be in mm or inches and is stored using three numbers,corresponding to its vector coordinates. The STL ﬁle itself holds no dimensions,so the AM machine operator must know whether the dimensions are mm, inches, or some other unit. Since each vertex also has three numbers, there are a total of 12 numbers to describe each triangle. The following ﬁle shows a simple ASCII STLﬁle that describes a right-angled, triangular pyramid structure, as shown inFig.15.1. Note that the ﬁle begins with an object name delimited as a solid. Triangles can be in any order, each delimited as a facet. The facet line also includes the normal352 15 Software Issues for Additive Manufacturingvector for that triangle. Note that this normal is calculated from any convenient location on the triangle and may be from one of the vertices or from the center of the triangle. It is deﬁned that the normal is perpendicular to the triangle and is of unit length. In most systems, the normal is used to deﬁne the outside of the surface of the solid, essentially pointing to the outside. The group of three vertices deﬁning the triangle is delimited by the terms “outer loop” and “endloop.” The outside of the triangle is best deﬁned using a right-hand rule approach. As we look at a triangle from the outside, the vertices should be listed in a counterclockwise order. Using the right hand with the thumb pointing upwards, the other ﬁngers curl in the direction of the order of the vertices, the starting vertex being arbitrary. This approach is becoming more popular since it avoids having to do any calculations with an additional number (i.e., the facet normal) and therefore STL ﬁles may not even require the normal to prevent ambiguity. A binary STL ﬁle can be described in the following way: Fig. 15.1 Aright-angled triangular pyramid as described by the sample STL ﬁle. Note that the bottom left -hand corner coincides with the origin and that every vertex coming out of the origin is of unit length15.2 Preparation of CAD Models: The STL File 353– An 80-byte ASCII header that can be used to describe the part – A 4 byte unsigned long integer that indicates the number of facets in the object– A list of facet records, each 50 bytes long The facet record will be presented in the following way: – 3 ﬂoating values of 4 bytes each to describe the normal vector – 3 ﬂoating values of 4 bytes each to describe the ﬁrst vertex– 3 ﬂoating values of 4 bytes each to describe the second vertex– 3 ﬂoating values of 4 bytes each to describe the third vertex– One unsigned integer of 2 bytes, that should be zero, used for checking 15.2.2 Creating STL Files from a CAD System Nearly all geometric solid modeling CAD systems can generate STL ﬁles from avalid, fully enclosed solid model. Most CAD systems can quickly tell the user if amodel is not a solid. This test is particularly necessary for systems that use surface modeling techniques, where it can be possible to create an object that is not fully closed off. Such systems would be used for graphics applications where there is aneed for powerful manipulation of surface detail (like with Autodesk AliasStudiosoftware [ 2] or Rhino from Robert McNeel & Associates [ 3]) rather than for engineering detailing. Solid modeling systems, like SolidWorks, may use surfacemodeling as part of the construction process, but the ﬁnal result is always a solidthat would not require such a test. Most CAD systems use a “Save as” or “Export” function to convert the native format into an STL ﬁle. There is typically some control over the size of the triangles to be used in the model. Since STL uses planar surfaces to approximate curvedsurfaces, then obviously the larger the triangles, the looser that approximationbecomes. Most CAD systems do not directly limit the size of the triangles since itis also obvious that the smaller the triangle, the larger the resulting ﬁle for a givenobject. An effective approach would be to minimize the offset between the triangleand the surface that it is supposed to represent. A perfect cube with perfectly sharpedges and points can be represented by 12 triangles, all with an offset of 0 between the STL ﬁle and the original CAD model. However, few designs would be that convenient and it is important to ensure a good balance between surface approxi-mation and excessively large ﬁle. Figure 15.2 shows the effect of changing the triangle offset parameter on an STL ﬁle. The exact value of the required offsetwould largely depend on the resolution or accuracy of the AM process to be used. Ifthe offset is smaller than the basic resolution of the process, then making it smallerwill have no effect on the precision of the resulting model. Since many AMprocesses operate around the 0.1 mm layer resolution, then a triangle offset of 0.05 mm or slightly lower will be acceptable for fabrication of most parts.354 15 Software Issues for Additive Manufacturing15.2.3 Calculation of Each Slice Profile Virtually every AM system will be able to read both binary and ASCII STL ﬁles. Since most AM processes work by adding layers of material of a prescribed thickness, starting at the bottom of the part and working upwards, the part ﬁle description must therefore be processed to extract the proﬁle of each layer. Each layer can be considered a plane in a nominal XY Cartesian frame. Incremental movement for each layer can then be along the orthogonal Zaxis. TheXYplane, positioned along the Zaxis, can be considered as a cutting plane. Any triangle intersecting this plane can be considered to contribute to the slice proﬁle. An algorithm like the one in Flowchart 15.1 can be used to extract all the proﬁle segments for a given STL ﬁle. The resultant of this algorithm is a set of intersecting lines that are ordered according to the set of intersecting planes. A program that is written according to this algorithm would have a number of additional components, including a way of deﬁning the start and end of each ﬁle and each plane. Furthermore, there would be no order to each line segment, which would be deﬁned in terms of the XY components and indexed by the plane that corresponds to each Zvalue. Also, the assumption is that the STL ﬁle has an arbitrary set of triangles that are randomly distributed. It may be possible to pre-process each ﬁle so that searches can be carried out in a more efﬁcient manner. One way to optimize the search would be to order the triangles according to the minimum Zvalue. A simple check for intersec- tion of a triangle with a plane would be to check the Zvalue for each vertex. If the Zvalue of any vertex in the triangle is less than or equal to the Zvalue of the plane, Fig. 15.2 An original CAD model converted into an STL ﬁle using different offset height (cusp) values, showing how the model accuracy will change according to the triangle offset15.2 Preparation of CAD Models: The STL File 355then that triangle may intersect the plane. Using the above test, once it has been established that a triangle does not intersect with the cutting plane, then every other triangle is known to be above that triangle and therefore does not require checking. A similar check could be done with the maximum Zvalue of a triangle. There are a number of discrete scenarios describing the intersection of each triangle with the cutting plane: All the vertices of a triangle lie above or below the intersecting plane. This triangle will not contribute to the proﬁle on this plane. A single vertex directly lies on the plane. In this case, there is one intersecting point, which can be ignored but the same vertex will be included in other triangles satisfying another condition below. Two vertices lie on the plane. Here one of the edges of the corresponding triangle lies on that plane and that edge contributes fully to the proﬁle. Three vertices lie on the plane. In this case, the whole triangle contributes wholly to the proﬁle, unless there are one or more adjacent triangles also lying on the plane, in which case the included edges can be ignored. One vertex lies above or below the intersecting plane and the other two vertices lie on the opposite side of the plane. In this case, an intersecting vector must be calculated from the edges of the triangle. Most triangles will conform to Scenario 1 or 5. Scenarios 2–4 may be considered special cases and require special treatment. Assuming that we have performed appropriate checks and that a triangle corresponds to scenario 5, then we must take action and generate a corresponding intersecting proﬁle vector. In this case, there will be two vectors deﬁned by the triangle vertices and these vectors will intersect with the cutting plane. The line connecting these two intersection points will form part of the outline for that plane. The problem to be solved is a classical line intersection with a plane problem. In this case, the line is deﬁned using Cartesian coordinates in ( x,y,z). The plane is deﬁned in ( x,y) for a speciﬁc constant height, z. In a general case, we can therefore project the line and plane onto the x¼0 and y¼0 planes. For the y¼0 plane, we can obtain something similar to Fig. 15.3. Points P1andP2correspond to two points Fig. 15.3 A vertex taken from an STL triangle projected onto the y¼0 plane. Since the height ziis known, we can derive the intersection point xi. A similar case can be done for yiin the x¼0 plane356 15 Software Issues for Additive Manufacturingof the intersecting triangle. Ppis the projected point onto the y¼0 plane to form a unique right-angled triangle. The angle θcan be calculated from tanθ¼z2/C0z1 ðÞ x2/C0x1 ðÞð15:1Þ since we know the zheight of the plane, we can use the following equation: tanθ¼zi/C0z1 ðÞ xi/C0x1 ðÞð15:2Þ and solve for xi A point yican also be found after projecting the same line on to the x¼0 plane to fully deﬁne the intersecting point Pi. A second intersecting point can be determined using another line of the triangle that intersects the plane. These twopoints will make up a line on the plane that forms part of the outline of the model. Itis possible to determine directionality of this line by correct use of the right-handrule, thus turning this line segment into a vector. This may be useful for determin-ing whether a completed curve forms part of an enclosing outline or corresponds toa hole. Once all intersecting lines have been determined according to Flowchart 15.1, then these lines must be joined together to form complete curves. This would be done using an algorithm based on that described in Flowchart 15.2. In this case, each line segment is tested to determine which segment is closest. A “closest point”algorithm is necessary since calculations may not exactly locate points together,even though the same line would normally be used to determine the start location ofone segment and the end of another. Note that this algorithm should really havefurther nesting to test whether a curve has been completed. If a curve is complete,then any remaining line segments would correspond to additional curves. These additional curves could form a nest of curves lying inside or outside others, or they could be separate. The two algorithms mentioned here focus on the intersection oftriangular facets with the cutting plane. A further development of these algorithmscould be to use the normal vectors of each triangle. In this way, it would be possibleto establish the external direction of a curve. This would be helpful in determiningnested curves. The outermost curve will be pointing outside the part. If a curve set ispointing inwards on itself then it is clear there must be a further curve envelopingthis one (see Fig. 15.3). Use of the normal vectors may also be helpful in organizing curve sets that are in very close proximity to each other. Once this stage has been completed, there will be a ﬁle containing an ordered set of vectors that will trace complete outlines corresponding to the intersecting plane.How these outlines are used depends somewhat on which AM technology is to beused. Many machines can use the vectors generated in Flowchart 15.2 to control a plotting process to draw the outlines of each layer. However, most machines would15.2 Preparation of CAD Models: The STL File 357also need to ﬁll in these outlines to make a solid. Flowchart 15.3 uses an inside/ outside algorithm to determine when to switch on a ﬁlling mechanism to drawscanning lines perpendicular to one of the planar axes. The assumption is that the part is fully enclosed inside the build envelope and therefore the default ﬁll is switched off.Start Read in STL Extract facet data from STL Scan facet data Get vertices no yesAll facets scanned? yesno FinishCompare facet with cutting plane Intersection?Store intersection line of facet on plane Flowchart 15.1 Algorithm for testing triangles and generating line intersections.

These algorithms need to be reﬁned to prevent errors and to tailor them to suit aparticular process. Other reﬁnements may be employed to speed the slicing processup by eliminating redundancy, for example. As mentioned in previous chapters, many AM systems require parts built using support structures. Supports are normally a loose-woven lattice pattern of material placed below the region to be supported. Such a lattice pattern could be a simpleStart Select a line and store in new line matrix Measure distance between tail of line and all other lines Have all lines been checked?

This assumes there is only a single contour in each plane (adapted from [ 4])15.2 Preparation of CAD Models: The STL File 359square pattern or something more complex like a hexagonal or even a fractal mesh. Furthermore, the lattice could be connected to the part with a tapered region that may be more convenient to remove when compared with thicker connecting edges. Determination of the regions to be supported can be made by analyzing the angle of the triangle normals. Those normals that are pointing downwards at somepreviously deﬁned minimum angle would require supports. Those triangles thatare sloping above that angle would not require supports. Supports are extended untilthey intersect either with the base platform or another upward facing surface of thepart. Supports connecting with the upward facing surface may also have a taper thatenables easy removal. The technique that would normally be used would be to extend supports from the entire build platform and eliminate any supports that do not intersect with the part at the minimum angle or less (see Fig. 15.4). The support structures could be generated directly as STL models and can be incorporated into the slicing algorithms already mentioned. However, they are moreStart at origin x = y = 0 Set plotting system off Increment y x=0 y(max) reached? y(max) reached?Increment scan in x direction change plotter state contact with profile? nono yesyesyes Finish Flowchart 15.3 Algorithm for ﬁlling in a 2D proﬁle based on vectors generated using Flowchart 15.2 and a raster scanning approach. Assume the proﬁle ﬁts inside the build volume, the raster scans in the Xdirection, and lines increment in the Ydirection360 15 Software Issues for Additive Manufacturinglikely to be directly generated by a proprietary algorithm within the slicing process. Some other processing requirements that would be dependent for different AM technologies include: –Raster scanning : While many technologies would use a simple raster scan for each layer, there are alternatives. Some systems use a switchable raster scan, scanning in the X direction of an XY plane for one layer and then moving to the Y direction for alternate layers. As discussed in Chap. 5, some systems subdivide the ﬁll area into smaller square regions and use switchable raster scans between squares. –Patterned vector scanning : Material extrusion technology requires a ﬁll pattern to be generated within an enclosed boundary. This is done using vectors generated using a patterning strategy. For a particular layer, a pattern would be determined by choosing a speciﬁc angle for the vectors to travel. The ﬁll is then a zigzag pattern along the direction deﬁned by this angle. Once a zigzag has reached an end there may be a need for further zigzag ﬁlls to complete a layer (see Fig. 15.5 for an example of zigzag scan pattern). –Hatching patterns : Sheet lamination processes like the, now discontinued, Helisys LOM and the Solid Centre machine from Kira require material surrounding the part to be hatched with a pattern that allows it to be de-cubed once the part has been completed (see Fig. 15.6). 15.3 Problems with STL Files Although the STL format is quite simple, there can still be errors in ﬁles resulting from CAD conversion. The following are typical problems that can occur in bad STL ﬁles: Unit changing : This is not strictly a result of a bad STL ﬁle. Since US machines still commonly use imperial measurements and most of the rest of the world uses metric, some ﬁles can appear scaled because there is no explicit mention of the units Fig. 15.4 Supports generated for a part build15.3 Problems with STL Files 361used in the STL format. If the person building the model is unaware of the purpose of the part then he may build it approximately 25 times too large or too small in one direction. Furthermore, units must correspond to the location of the origin within the machine to be used. This normally means that the physical origin of the machine lies in the bottom left-hand corner and so all triangle coordinates within an STL ﬁle must be positive. However, this may not be the case for a particular part made in the CAD system and so some adjustment offset of the STL ﬁle may be required. Vertex to vertex rule : Each triangle must share two of its vertices with each of the triangles adjacent to it. This means that a vertex cannot intersect the side of another, like that shown in Fig. 15.7. This is not something that is explicitly stated in the STL ﬁle description and therefore STL ﬁle generation may not adhere to this rule. However, a number of checks can be made on the ﬁle to determine whether this rule has been violated. For example, the number of faces of a proper solid deﬁned using STL must be an even number. Furthermore, the number of edges must be divisible by three and follow the equation: Fig. 15.5 A scan pattern using vector scanning in material extrusion. Note the outline drawn ﬁrst followed by a small number of zigzag patterns to ﬁll in the space Fig. 15.6 Hatching pattern for LOM-based (sheet lamination) processes. Note the outside hatch pattern that will result in cubes which will be separated from the solid part during post-processing362 15 Software Issues for Additive ManufacturingNo :of faces No :of edges¼3 2ð15:3Þ Leaking STL ﬁles : As mentioned earlier, STL ﬁles should describe fully enclosed surfaces that represent the solids generated within the originating CAD system. In other words, STL data ﬁles should construct one or more manifold entities according to Euler’s Rule for solids: No :of faces /C0No :of edges þNo :of vertices ¼2/C2No :of bodies ð15:4Þ If this rule does not hold then the STL ﬁle is said to be leaking and the ﬁle slices will not represent the actual model. There may be too few or too many vectors for a particular slice. Slicing software may add in extra vectors to close the outline or it may just ignore the extra vectors. Small defects can possibly be ignored in this way. Large leaks may result in unacceptable ﬁnal models. Leaks can be generated by facets crossing each other in 3D space as shown in Fig.15.8. This can result from poorly generated CAD models, particularly those that do not use Boolean operations when generating solids. A CAD model may also be generated using a method which stitches together surface patches. If the triangulated edges of two surface patches do not match up with each other, then holes, like in Fig. 15.9, may occur. Degenerated facets : These facets normally result from numerical truncation. A triangle may be so small that all three points virtually coincide with each other. Fig. 15.7 A case that violates the vertex-to- vertex rule Fig. 15.8 Two triangles intersecting each other in 3D space15.3 Problems with STL Files 363After truncation, these points lay on top of each other causing a triangle with no area. This can also occur when a truncated triangle returns no height and all three vertices of the triangle lie on a single straight line. While the resulting slicing algorithm will not cause incorrect slices, there may be some difﬁculties with any checking algorithms and so such triangles should really be removed from the STL ﬁle. It is worth mentioning that, while a few errors may creep into some STL ﬁles, most professional 3D CAD systems today produce high-quality and error-free results. In the past, problems more commonly occurred from surface modeling systems, which are now becoming scarcer, even in ﬁelds outside of engineering CAD-like computer graphics and 3D gaming software. Also, in earlier systems, STL generation was not properly checked and faults were not detected within the CAD system. Nowadays, potential problems are better understood and there are well-known algorithms for detecting and correcting such problems. However, the recent surge in home-use 3D Printers has resulted in a large selection of software routines that are freely available but not thoroughly tested and could suffer from the problems described in this chapter. 15.4 STL File Manipulation Once a part has been converted into STL there are only a few operations that can be performed. This is because the triangle-based deﬁnition does not permit radical changes to the data. Associations between individual triangles are through the shared points and vertices only. A point or vertex can be moved, which will affect the connected triangles, but creating a regional affect on larger groups of points would be more difﬁcult. Consider the modeling of a simple geometry, like the cut cylinder in Fig. 15.10a . Making a minor change in one of the measurements may result in a very radical change in distribution of the triangles. While it is possible to simplify the model by reducing the number of triangles, it is quite easy to see that deﬁning boundaries in most models cannot be easily done. The addition of a ﬁllet in Fig.15.10b shows an even more radical change in the STL ﬁle. Furthermore, if one Fig. 15.9 Two surface patches that do not match up with each other, resulting in holes364 15 Software Issues for Additive Manufacturingwere to attempt to move the oval that represents the cut surface, the triangles representing the ﬁlet would no longer show a constant-radius curve. Building models using AM is often done by people working in departments or companies that are separate from the original designers. It may be that whoever is building the model may not have direct access to the original CAD data. There may therefore be a need to modify the STL data before the part is to be built. The following sections discuss STL tools that are commonly used. 15.4.1 Viewers There are a number of STL viewers available, often as a free download. An example is STLview from Marcam [ 5] (see Fig. 15.11 ). Like many other systems, this software allows limited access to the STL ﬁle, making it possible to view the triangles, apply shading, show sections, etc. By purchasing the full software version, other tools are possible, for example, allowing the user to measure the part at various locations, annotate the part, display slice information, and detect potential problems with the data. Often the free tools allow passive viewing of the STL data, while the more advanced tools permit modiﬁcation of the data, either by rewriting the STL or supplying additional information with the STL data (like measurement information, for example). Often these viewers are connected to part building services and provided by the company as an incentive to use these services and to help reduce errors in data transfer, either from incorrect STL conversion or from wrong interpretation of the design intent. 15.4.2 STL Manipulation on the AM Machine STL data for a part consist of a set of points deﬁned in space, based on an arbitrarily selected point of origin. This origin point may not be appropriate to the machine the part is to be built on. Furthermore, even if the part is correctly deﬁned within the machine space, the user may wish to move the part to some other location or to Fig. 15.10 STL ﬁles of a cut cylinder. Note that although the two models in ( a) are very similar, the location of the triangles is very different. Addition of a simple ﬁlet in ( b) shows even greater change in the STL ﬁle15.4 STL File Manipulation 365make a duplicate to be built beside the original part. Other tasks, like scaling, changing orientation, and merging with other STL ﬁles are all things that are routinely done using the STL manipulation tools on the AM machine. Creation of the support structures is also something that would normally be expected to be done on the AM machine. This would normally be done automati- cally and would be an operation applied to downward-facing triangles. Supports would be extended to the base of the AM machine or to any upward facing triangle placed directly below. Triangles that are only just veering away from the vertical (e.g., less than 10/C14) may be ignored for some AM technologies. Note, for example, the supports generated around the cup handle in Fig. 15.4. With some AM operating systems there is little or no control over placement of supports or manipulation of the model STL data. Considering Fig. 15.4 again, it may be possible to build the handle feature without so many supports, or even with no supports at all. A small amount of sagging around the handle may be evident, but the user may prefer this to having to clean up the model to remove the support material. If this kind of control is required by the user, it may be necessary to purchase additional third party software, like the MAGICS and 3-matic systems from Materialise [ 6]. Such third party software may also be used to undertake additional roles. MAGICS, for example, has a number of modules useful to many AM technologies. Other STL ﬁle manipulators may have similar modules: – Checking the integrity of STL ﬁles based on the problems described above. – Incorporating support structures including tapered features on the supports that may make them easier to remove. – Optimizing the use of AM machines, like ensuring the machine is efﬁciently ﬁlled with parts, the amount of support structures is minimized, etc. Fig. 15.11 The VisCAM viewer from Marcam that can be used to inspect STL models366 15 Software Issues for Additive Manufacturing– Adding in features like serial numbers and identifying marks onto the parts to ensure correct identiﬁcation, easy assembly, etc. – Remeshing STL ﬁles that may have been created using Reverse Engineering software or other non-CAD-based systems. Such ﬁles may be excessively large and can often be reduced in size without compromising the part accuracy. – Segmenting large models or combining multiple STL ﬁles into a single model data set. – Performing Boolean tasks like subtracting model data from a tool insert blank model to create a mold. 15.5 Beyond the STL File The STL deﬁnition was created by 3D Systems right at the start of the developmenthistory of AM technology and has served the industry well. However, there areother ways in which ﬁles can be deﬁned for creation of the slice. Furthermore, thefact that the STL ﬁle only represents the surface geometry may cause problems forparts that require some heterogeneous content. This section will discuss some of theissues surrounding this area. 15.5.1 Direct Slicing of the CAD Model Since generation of STL ﬁles can be tedious and error-prone, there may be somebeneﬁt from using inbuilt CAD tools to directly generate slice data for the AMmachines. It is a trivial task for most 3D solid modeling CAD systems to calculate the intersection of a plane with a model, thus extracting a slice. This slice data would ordinarily need to be processed to suit the drive system of the AM technol-ogy, but this can be handled in most CAD systems with the use of macros. Supportstructures can be generated using standard geometry speciﬁcations and projectedonto the part from a virtual representation of the AM machine build platform. Although this approach has never been a popular method for creating slice data, it has been investigated as a research topic [ 7] and even developed to suit a commercialized variant of the Stereolithography process by a German company called Fockle & Schwarz. The major barrier to using this approach is that every CAD system must include a suite of different algorithms for direct slicing for avariety of machines or technologies. This would be a cumbersome approach thatmay require periodic updates of the technology as new machines become available.There may be some beneﬁt in the future in creating an integrated design andmanufacturing solution, especially for niche applications or for low-cost solutions.However, at present it is more sensible to separate the development of the designtools from that of the AM technology by using the STL format.15.5 Beyond the STL File 36715.5.2 Color Models Currently, several AM technologies are available on the market that can produce parts with color variations, including full color output, including the color binder jetting technology from 3D Systems, material jetting machines from 3D Systems and Stratasys, and sheet lamination systems from Mcor Technologies. Coloredparts have proven to be very popular, and it is likely that other color AM machineswill make their way to the market. The conventional STL ﬁle contains no informa-tion pertaining to the color of the part or any features thereon. Coloring of STL ﬁlesis possible and there are in fact color STL ﬁle deﬁnitions available [ 8], but you would be limited by the fact that a single triangle can only be one speciﬁc color. It istherefore much better to use the VRML painting options that allow you to assign bitmap images to individual facets [ 8]. In such a way, it is possible to take advantage of the color possibilities that the AM machine can give you. 15.5.3 Multiple Materials Carrying on from the previous section, color is one of the simplest examples ofmultiple material products that AM is capable of producing. As has been mentionedin other chapters, parts can be made using AM from composite materials, withvarying levels of porosity or indeed with regions containing discretely differentmaterials. For many of these new AM technologies, STL is starting to become animpediment. Since the STL deﬁnition is for surface data only, the assumptiontherefore is that the solid material between these surfaces is homogeneous. As we can see from the above this may not be the case. While there has been signiﬁcant thought applied to the problem of representations for heterogeneous solid modeling[9], there is still much to be considered before we can arrive at a standard to supersede STL for future AM technology, as discussed in Sect. 15.7. 15.5.4 Use of STL for Machining STL is used for applications beyond just converting CAD to additive manufacturing input. Reverse Engineering packages can also be used to convert point cloud datadirectly into STL ﬁles without the need for CAD. Such technology connecteddirectly to AM could conceivably form the basis for a 3D Fax machine. Anothertechnology that can easily make use of STL ﬁles is subtractive manufacturing. Subtractive manufacturing systems can readily make use of the surface data represented in STL to determine the boundaries for machining. With some addi- tional knowledge concerning the dimensions of the starting block of material, tool,machining center, etc., it is possible to calculate machining strategies for creating a3D surface model. As mentioned in earlier chapters, the likelihood is that it may notbe possible to fully machine complex geometries due to undercutting features,internal features, etc. but there is no reason why STL ﬁles cannot be used to create368 15 Software Issues for Additive ManufacturingComputer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) proﬁles for machining centers. Delft Spline [ 10] has been using STL ﬁles to create CAM proﬁles for a number of years now. Figure 15.12 shows the progression of a model through to a tool to manufacture a ﬁnal product using their DeskProto software. Another technologythat uses a hybrid of subtractive and additive processes to fabricate parts is the SRP(Subtractive Rapid Prototyping) technique developed by Roland [ 11] for their desktop milling machines. The creation of ﬁnish machining tool paths for AM parts from STL ﬁles is also discussed in Chap. 14. 15.6 Additional Software to Assist AM As well as directly controlling the manufacturing process, other software systems may be helpful in running an effective and efﬁcient AM-based facility. Fig. 15.12 DeskProto software being used to derive machine tool paths from STL ﬁle data to form a mold for creating the windscreen of a motorcycle15.6 Additional Software to Assist AM 36915.6.1 Survey of Software Functions Such software can include one or more of the following functions: Simulation : Many operating systems can perform a simulation of the machines operations in a build process, showing how the layers will be formed step by step in accelerated time. This can allow the user to detect obvious errors in the slice ﬁlesand determine whether critical features can be built. This may be particularlyimportant for processes like material extrusion where the hatch patterns can havea critical effect on thin wall features, for example. Some work has been carried outto simulate AM systems to get a better impression of the ﬁnal result, includingrendered images to give an understanding of the surface roughness for a given layerthickness, for example [ 12]. Build -time estimation : AM is a highly automated process and the latest machines are very reliable and can operate unattended for long periods of time. For effectiveprocess planning it is very important to know when a build is going to be completed.Knowing this will help in determining when operators will be required to changeover jobs. Good estimates will also help to balance builds; adding or subtracting apart from the job batch may ensure that the machine cycle will complete within aday-shift, for example, making it possible to keep machines running unattended atnight. Also, if you are running multiple machines, it would be helpful to stagger the builds throughout the shift to optimize the manual work required. Early build-time estimation software was extremely unreliable, performing rolling calculations ofthe average build time per layer. Since the layer time is dependent on the partgeometry, such estimates could be very imprecise and vary wildly, especially at thebeginning of a build. Later software versions saw the beneﬁt in having more precisebuild-time estimations. A simpliﬁed build-time model is discussed in Chap. 16. Machine setup : While every AM machine has an operating system that makes it possible to set up a build, such systems can be very basic, particularly in terms of manipulation of the STL ﬁles. Determining build parameters based on a speciﬁc material is normally very comprehensive however. Monitoring : This is a relatively new feature for most AM systems. Even though nearly every AM machine will be connected either directly or indirectly to theInternet, this has traditionally been for uploading of model ﬁles for building. Exportof information from the machine to the Internet or within an Intranet has not beencommon except in the larger, more expensive machines. The simplest monitoringsystems would provide basic information concerning the status of the build and how much longer before it is complete. However, more complex systems may tell you about how much material is remaining, the current status parameters liketemperatures, laser powers, etc. and whether there is any need for manual interven-tion through an alerting system. Some monitoring systems may also provide videofeedback of the build. Planning : Having a simulation of the AM process running on a separate com- puter may be helpful to those working in process planning. Process planners may beable to determine what a build could look like, thus allowing the possibility of planning for new jobs, variability analysis, or quoting.370 15 Software Issues for Additive ManufacturingOnce again such software may be available from the AM system vendor or from a third party vendor. The advantage of third party software is that it is more likely tobe modiﬁed to suit the exact requirements of the user. 15.6.2 AM Process Simulations Using Finite Element Analysis Finite element analysis (FEA) techniques are increasingly popular tools to predicthow the outcome of various manufacturing processes change with changing processparameters, geometry and/or material. Commercial software packages such asSYSWELD, COMSOL, MoldFlow, ANSYS, and DEFORM are used to predictthe outcomes of welding, forming, molding, casting, and other processes. AM technologies are particularly difﬁcult to simulate using predictive ﬁnite element tools. For instance, the multiscale nature of metal powder bed fusionapproaches such as metal laser sintering and electron beam melting are incredibly time consuming to accurately simulate using physics-based FEA. AM processes are inherently multiscale in nature, and ﬁne-scale ﬁnite element meshes that are 10 μm or smaller in size are required to accurately capture the solidiﬁcation physicsaround the melt pool, while the overall part size can be 10,000 times larger thanthe element size. In three dimensions, this means that if we apply a uniform 10 μm mesh size, we would need 10 8elements in the ﬁrst layer and more than 1012 elements in total to capture the physics for a single part that ﬁlls much of a powderbed. Since rapid movement of a point heat source is used to create parts, capturing the physics requires a time step of 10 ms or less during laser/electron beam melting, which for a complete build would require more than 10 10total time steps. To solve a problem with this, number of elements for this many time steps on a relatively high-speed supercomputer would take billions of years. Thus, to date all AM simulationtools are limited to predictions of only a small fraction of a part, or very small,simpliﬁed geometries. Using existing FEA tools, several researchers are looking for ways to make assumptions whereby they can cut and paste solutions from simpliﬁed geometries to form a solution for large, complex geometries. This approach has the beneﬁt of faster solution time; however, for large, complex geometries these types ofpredictions fail to accurately capture the effects of changing scan patterns, complexaccumulation of residual stresses, and localized thermal characteristics. In addition,minor changes to input conditions can make the simpliﬁed solutions invalid. Thus asimulation infrastructure which can quickly build up a “new” answer for anyarbitrary geometry, input condition, and scan pattern is the ultimate goal for apredictive AM simulation tool. Recently, researchers have begun using dynamic, multiscale moving meshes to accelerate FEA analysis for AM [ 13]. These types of multiscale simulations are many orders of magnitude faster than standard FEA simulations. Howevermultiscale simulations alone are still too slow to enable a complete part simulation,even on the world’s fastest supercomputers. Thus a new computational approachfor AM is needed, which can extend FEA beyond its historical capabilities. 3DSIM,15.6 Additional Software to Assist AM 371a new software start-up, is seeking to do that for the AM industry. 3DSIM software tools include: (1) a new approach to formulating and solving multiscale movingmeshes, (2) a novel ﬁnite element-based Eigensolver which predicts thermal evo- lution and residual stresses very quickly in regions of low thermal gradients, (3) an insigniﬁcant number truncation Cholesky module which eliminates the “multipli-cation by zero” calculations that occur when solving sparse ﬁnite element matrices,and (4) an Eigenmodal approach to identifying periodicity in AM computations toenable feed-forward “insertion” of solutions into regions where periodicity ispresent and the solution is already known from a prior time step. These approachesare reported to reduce the solution time for large-scale AM problems by orders ofmagnitude. Taken together, these tools should make the full part problem solvable in less than a day on a desktop GPU-based supercomputer when the algorithms are fully implemented in a combined software infrastructure. If realized, the ability topredict how process parameter and material changes affect part accuracy, distor-tion, residual stress, microstructure, and properties would be a signiﬁcant advance-ment for the AM industry. 15.7 The Additive Manufacturing File Format It has already been discussed that, while effective, there are numerous difﬁcultiessurrounding the STL format. As AM technologies move forward to include multi-ple materials, lattice structures, and textured surfaces, it is likely that an alternative format will be required. The ASTM Committee F42 on Additive Manufacturing Technologies released the ASTM 2915-12 AMF Standard Speciﬁcation for AMFFormat 1.1 in May 2011 [ 14]. This ﬁle format is still very much under development, but has already been implemented in some commercial and beta-stage software.Considerably more complex than the STL format, AMF aims to embrace a wholehost of new part descriptions that have hindered the development of current AMtechnologies. These include the following features: Curved triangles : In STL, the surface normal lies on the same plane as the triangle vertices that it is connected to. However, in AMF, the start location of the normal vector does not have to lie on the same plane. If so, the correspondingtriangle must be curved. The deﬁnition of curvature is such that all triangle edgesmeeting at that vertex are curved so that they are perpendicular to that normal and inthe plane deﬁned by the normal and the original straight edge (i.e., if the originaltriangle had straight edges rather than curved ones). By specifying the triangles inthis way, many fewer triangles need be used for a typical CAD model. Thisaddresses problems associated with large STL ﬁles resulting from complex geome- try models for high-resolution systems. The curved triangle approach is still an approximation since the degree of curvature cannot be too high. Overall accuracy ishowever signiﬁcantly improved in terms of cusp height deviation. Color : Color can be assigned in a nested way so that the main body of the part can be colored according to a function within the original design. Red, Green, andBlue coloration can be applied along with a transparency value to vertices,372 15 Software Issues for Additive Manufacturingtriangles, volumes, objects, or materials. Note that many AM processes, like vat photopolymerization, can make clear parts, so the transparency value can be aneffective parameter. Color values may work along with other materials-based parameters to provide a versatile way of controlling an AM process. Texture : The above color assignment cannot deal directly with image data assigned to objects. This can however be achieved using the texture operator.Texture is assigned ﬁrst geometrically, by scaling it to the feature so that individualpixels apply to the object in a uniform way. These pixels will have intensity, whichare then assigned color. It should be noted that this is an image texturing processsimilar to computer graphics rather than a physical texture, like ridges or dimples. Material : Different volumes can be assigned to be made using different materials. Currently the Connex machines from Stratasys and some other extrusion-based systems have the capacity to build multiple material parts. At themoment designing parts requires a tedious redeﬁnition process within themachine’s operating system. By having a material deﬁnition within AMF, it ispossible to carry this all the way through from the design stage. Material variants : AMF operators can be used to modify the basic structure of the part to be fabricated. For example, many medical and aerospace applicationsmay require a lattice or porous structure. An operator can be applied so that a speciﬁed volume can be constructed using an internal lattice structure or porous material. Furthermore, some AM technologies would be capable of making partsfrom materials that gradually blend with others. A periodic operator can be appliedto a surface that will turn it into a physical texture, rather than the color mappingmentioned earlier. It is even possible to apply a random operator to provide unusualeffects to the AM part. It should be noted that a part designed and coded using the AMF will almost certainly look differently when built using different machines. This will be particu- larly so for parts that are coded according to different materials, colors, and textures. Each machine will have the capacity to accept and interpret the AMFdesign according to functionality. For example, if a part is deﬁned with a ﬁnetexture, a lower resolution process will not be able to apply it so well. Opaquematerials will not be able to make much use of the transparency function. Somemachines will not be able to create parts with multiple materials, and so on. Itshould also be noted that machines should all be able to accept the geometrydeﬁnition and make something of the AMF deﬁned part. AMF is therefore back- wards compatible so that it can recognize a simple STL ﬁle, but with the capacity to specify any conceivable design in the future. 15.8 Exercises How would you adjust Flowchart 15.2 to include multiple contours?

Although it may seem that DDM is a natural extensionof rapid prototyping, in practice this is not usually the case. Many additionalconsiderations and requirements come into play for production manufacturing that are not important for prototyping. In this chapter, we explore these considerations through an examination of several DDM examples, distinctionsbetween prototyping and production, and advantages of additive manufacturingfor custom and low-volume production. Many times, DDM applications have taken advantage of the geometric complexity capabilities of AM technologies to produce parts with customizedgeometries. In these instances, DDM is not a replacement for mass productionapplications, as customized geometry cannot be mass produced using traditional manufacturing technologies. In addition, since the economics of AM technologies do not enable economically competitive high-volume productionfor most geometries and applications, DDM is often most economical forlow-volume production applications. Two major individual-speciﬁc medicalapplications of DDM will be discussed, from Align Technology and Siemens/Phonak, as well as several other applications that make use of the unique designfreedom afforded by AM techniques. This will be followed by a discussion of theunique characteristics of AM technologies that lead to DDM. 16.1 Align Technology Align Technology, in Santa Clara, California, is in the business of providingorthodontic treatment devices ( www.aligntech.com ). Their Invisalign treatments are essentially clear braces, called aligners, that are worn on the teeth (see Fig.16.1). Every 1–2 weeks, the orthodontic patient receives a new set of aligners #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_16375that are intended to continue moving their teeth. That is, every 1–2 weeks, new aligners that have slightly different shapes are fabricated and shipped to thepatient’s orthodontist for ﬁtting. Over the total treatment time (several months toa year typically), the aligners cause the patient’s teeth to move from their initialposition to the position desired by the orthodontist. If both the upper and lower teethmust be adjusted for 6 months, then 26 different aligners are needed for one patient,assuming that aligners are shipped every 2 weeks. The need for many different geometries in a short period of time requires a mass customization approach to aligner production. Align’s manufacturing process hasbeen extensively engineered. First, the orthodontist takes an impression of thepatient’s mouth with a typical dental clay. The impression is shipped to AlignTechnology where it is scanned using a laser digitizer. The resulting point cloud isconverted into a tessellation (set of triangles) that describes the geometry of themouth. This tessellation is separated into gums and teeth, then each tooth isseparated into its own set of triangles. Since the data for each tooth can be manipulated separately, an Align Technology technician can perform treatment operations as prescribed by the patient’s orthodontist. Each tooth can be positionedinto its desired ﬁnal position. Then, the motion of each tooth can be divided into aseries of treatments (represented by different aligners). For example, if 13 differentupper aligners are needed over 6 months, the total motion of a tooth can be dividedinto 13 increments. After manipulating the geometric information into speciﬁctreatments, aligner molds are built in one of Align’s SLA-7000 stereolithography(SL) machines. The aligners themselves are fabricated by thermal forming of a sheet of clear plastic over SL molds in the shape of the patient’s teeth. The aligner development process is geographically distributed, as well as highly engineered. Obviously, the patient and orthodontist are separated from Align Fig. 16.1 Aligner from Align Technology (Courtesy Align Technology)376 16 Direct Digital ManufacturingTechnology headquarters in California. Their data processing for the aligners is performed in Costa Rica, translating customer-speciﬁc, doctor-prescribed toothmovements into a set of aligner models. Each completed dataset is transferred electronically to Align’s manufacturing facility in Juarez Mexico, where the dataset is added into a build on one of their SL machines. After building the mold using VPfrom the dataset, the molds are thermal formed. After thermal forming, they areshipped back to Align and, from there, shipped to the orthodontist or the patient. Between its founding in 1997 and March, 2009, over 44 million aligners have been created ( www.aligntech.com ). At present, Align’s SL machines are able to operate 24 h per day, producing approximately 100 aligner molds in one SLA-7000build, with a total production capacity of 45,000–50,000 unique aligners per day (~17 million per year) [ 1]. As each aligner is unique, they are truly “customized.” And by any measure, 45,000 components per day is mass production and notprototyping. Thus, Align Technology represents an excellent example of “masscustomization” using direct digital manufacturing (DDM), albeit in a toolingapplication. To achieve mass customization, Align needed to overcome the time-consuming pre- and post-processing steps in SL usage. A customized version of 3D SystemsLightyear control software was developed, called MakeTray; to automate most of the build preparation. Aligner mold models are laid out, supports are generated, process variables are set, and the models are sliced automatically. Typical post-processing steps, including rinsing and post-curing can take hours. Instead, Aligndeveloped several of its own post-processing technologies. They developed arinsing station that utilizes only warm water, instead of hazardous solvents. Afterrinsing, conveyors transport the platforms to the special UV post-cure station thatAlign developed. UV lamps provide intense energy that can post-cure an entireplatform in 2 min, instead of the 30–60 min that are typical in a Post-Cure Apparatus unit. Platforms traverse the entire post-processing line in 20 min. Sup- port structures are removed manually at present, although this step is targeted forautomation. The Align Technology example illustrates some of the growing painsexperienced when trying to apply technologies developed for prototyping to pro-duction applications. 16.2 Siemens and Phonak Siemens Hearing Instruments, Inc. ( www.siemens-hearing.com ) and Phonak Hearing Systems are competitors in the hearing aid business. In the early 2000s,they teamed up to investigate the feasibility of using polymer powder bed fusion (PBF) technology in the production of shells for hearing aids [ 2]. A typical hearing aid is shown in Fig. 16.2. The production of hearing aid shells (housings that ﬁt into the ear) required many manual steps. Each hearing aid must be shaped to ﬁt into anindividual’s ear. Fitting problems cause up to 1 out of every 4 hearing aids to bereturned to the manufacturer, a rate that would be devastating in most otherindustries.16.2 Siemens and Phonak 377Traditionally, an impression is taken of a patient’s ear, which is then used as a pattern to make a mold for the hearing aid shell. An acrylic material is then injected into the mold to form the shell. Electronics, controls, and a cover plate are added to complete the hearing aid. To ensure proper operation and comfort, hearing aidsmust ﬁt snugly, but not too tightly, into the ear and must remain in place when thepatient talks and chews (which change the geometry of the ear). To signiﬁcantly reduce return rates and improve customer satisfaction, Siemens and Phonak sought to redesign their hearing aid production processes. Since AMtechnologies require a solid CAD model of the design to be produced, thecompanies had to introduce solid modeling CAD systems into the production process. Impressions are still taken from patients’ ears, but are scanned by a laser scanner, rather than used directly as a pattern. The point cloud is converted into a3D CAD model, which is manipulated to ﬁne-tune the shell design so that a good ﬁtis achieved. This CAD shell model is then exported as an STL ﬁle for processing byan AM machine. A scanned point cloud is shown superimposed on a hearing aidmodel in Fig. 16.3. In the mid-2000s, Siemens developed a process to produce shells using vat photopolymerization (VP) technology to complement their PBF fabrication capa- bility. VP has two main advantages over PBF. First, VP has better feature detail, which makes it possible to fabricate small features on shells that aid assembly toother hearing aid components. Second, acrylate VP materials are similar to thematerials originally used in the hearing aid industry (heat setting acrylates), whichare biocompatible. As mentioned, Siemens originally adopted PBF fabrication;PBF has strengths in that the nylon polyamide materials typically used in PBF arebiocompatible and the surface ﬁnish of PBF parts aided hearing aid retention in theear, since the ﬁnish had a powder-bed texture. In the late 2000s, Siemens Hearing Instruments produced about 250,000 hearing aids annually. In 2007, they claimed that about half of the in-the-ear hearing aidsthat they produced in the USA were fabricated using AM technologies. Since the Fig. 16.2 Siemens LASR® hearing aid and shell378 16 Direct Digital Manufacturingintroduction of AM-fabricated hearing aid shells, most hearing aid manufacturers in the Western world have adopted AM in order to compete with Siemens and Phonak.Recent surveys estimate that about 90 % of all custom in-the-ear hearing aid shellsare fabricated using AM, which totaled approximately two million AM fabricatedshells in 2012 [ 1]. Since the adoption of AM, hearing aid return rate has fallen dramatically with improved design and manufacturing processes. A number of technology advances have targeted this market. 3D Systems developed a variant of its SLA Viper Si2 machine to manufacture shells, called the SLA Viper HA. The machine contains two small vats, one with a red-tinted resin and the other with a blue-tinted resin. The idea is to fabricate both the left andright hearing aid shells for a patient in one build, where each shell is a differentcolor, enabling the patient to easily distinguish them. Of course, the resins can beswapped with ﬂesh-colored resin in both vats, if desired by a patient. EnvisionTEChas also focused on this market, developing several VP machines that are designedfor hearing aid shells. Additionally, companies such as Rapid Shape, in Germany,and Carima, in South Korea, have entered the market with mask projection VP machines. The hearing aid shell production is a great example of how companies can take advantage of the shape complexity capability of RP technologies to economicallyachieve mass customization. With improvements in scanning technology, it islikely that patients’ ears can be scanned directly, eliminating the need forimpressions [ 3]. If desktop AM systems can be developed, it may even be possible to fabricate custom hearing aids in the audiologist’s ofﬁce, rather than having toship impressions or datasets to a central location! Fig. 16.3 Hearing aid within scanned point cloud16.2 Siemens and Phonak 37916.3 Custom Footwear and Other DDM Examples A British company called Prior 2 Lever (P2L) claims to be manufacturing the world’s ﬁrst custom soccer shoes for professional athletes. Polymer PBF is used to fabricate the outsoles, including cleats, for individual customers [ 4]. The one-piece leather uppers are also custom tailored. A model called the Assassin retailed in 2008 for £6,000 per pair; a photo is shown in Fig. 16.4. Research on PBF outsoles for custom shoes started in the early 2000s at Loughborough University; Freedom of Creation and others contributed to the development of this work. Early testing demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction in peak pressures during walking and running with personalized outsoles [ 5]. Custom sprinting shoes and triathlete shoes are also being developed. In 2013, Nike developed a line of football cleats called the Vapor Laser Talon. The cleat plate was specially designed to improve player performance, particularly for speed positions. It has an intricate, lattice design and was fabricating using PBF in a proprietary polymer material. The examples presented so far all relate to body-ﬁtting, customized parts. However, many other opportunities exist, even in the medical arena. Many companies worldwide are investigating the use of PBF technologies for the creation of orthopedic implants. For instance, Adler Ortho Group of Italy is using Arcam’s EBM system to produce stock sizes of acetabular cups for hip implants made from Ti–6Al–4V. The use of AM techniques enables a more compact design and a better transition between the solid bearing surface and the porous bone-ingrowth portion of the implant. Although a porous coating of titanium beads or hydroxyapatite on an implant’s surface work well, they do not provide the optimum conditions for osseointegration. The hierarchical structure capabilities of AM enable the creation of a more optimal bone-ingrowth structure for osseointegration. As of early 2014, more than 40,000 cups have been implanted and more than 90,000 implants have been produced in series production by companies such as Adler Ortho and Lima Corporate SpA. More generally, approximately 20 different AM medical implant products have received FDA clearance for implantation in patients [ 1]. Fig. 16.4 Assassin model soccer shoe. Courtesy prior 2 lever380 16 Direct Digital ManufacturingLow-volume production is often economical via AM since hard tooling does not need to be developed. This has led to the rapid adoption of DDM for low-volumecomponents across many industries. However, the most exciting aspects of DDM are the opportunities to completely rethink how components can be shaped in order to best fulﬁll their functions, as discussed in Chap. 13. Integrated designs can be produced that combine several parts, eliminate assembly operations, improveperformance by designing parts to utilize material efﬁciently, eliminate shapecompromises driven by manufacturing limitations, and completely enable newstyles of products to be produced. This can be true for housewares, every-dayitems, and even customized luxury items, as illustrated in Chap. 17with respect to houseware and fashion products. Each of these areas will be explored brieﬂy in this section. Many of the examples were taken, or cited, in recent Wohlers Reports [1,6]. Stratasys developed a new class of material extrusion (ME) machines in 2007, the Fortus X00mc series. They introduced the Fortus 900mc in December andreported that 32 parts on the machine were fabricated on their ME machines. Thisis a novel example of how AM producers are using their own technologies inlow-volume production, and the savings that can be achieved by not having toinvest in tooling. Since introducing the 900mc, Stratasys has marketed several new models, presumably using in-house fabricated parts on these models as well. This is also true for other major AM manufacturers, including EOS and 3D Systems. The aerospace industry has been the source of quite a few successful examples of DDM. The F-18 ﬁghter jet example from Chap. 17, where Boeing and Northrop Grumman manufacture many nonstructural components using polymer PBF, is onesuch case. In addition, SAAB Avitronics has used polymer PBF to manufactureantenna RF boxes for an unmanned aircraft. Advantages of this approach overconventional manufacturing processes include a more compact design, 45 % reduc- tion in mass, and integral features. Paramount Industries, a division of 3D Systems, produced PBF parts for a helicopter, including ventilation parts and electricalenclosures, and structures for unmanned aerial vehicles. The parts weremanufactured on their EOSINT P 700 machine from EOS using the PA 2210 FRmaterial (ﬂame retardant). Additionally, thousands of parts are ﬂying on the spaceshuttle, space station, and various military aircraft. Many of the most promising commercial aircraft applications are delayed until better ﬂame retardant materials were certiﬁed for commercial use. Now, with ﬂame retardant PBF materials, Boeing has developed PBF components on commercial 737, 747 777, and 787 programs. In addition, large numbers of PBF components arepresent on several military derivative aircrafts, such as the Airborne Early Warningand Control (AEWC), C-40, AWACS, and P-8 aircraft. All told, tens of thousandsof parts are ﬂying on at least eight different military and eight different civilianmodels of Boeing aircraft. As another example, Northrop Grumman has identiﬁedmore than 1,400 parts on a single ﬁghter aircraft platform that could be better madeusing PBF than traditional methods if a suitable material with higher-temperature properties were available.16.3 Custom Footwear and Other DDM Examples 381In the automotive industry, examples of DDM are emerging. Formula 16.1 teams have been using AM technologies extensively on their racecars for several years.Applications include electrical housings, camera mounts, and other aerodynamic parts. In the late 2000s, the Renault Formula 1 team used over 900 parts on racecars each racing season. Indy and NASCAR teams also make extensive use of AM partson their cars. Local Motors conducted a crowd-sourced car design project, with the require- ment that the majority of the car would be fabricated by AM. Speciﬁcally, theyintend to use a hybrid additive/subtractive machine under development at the OakRidge National Laboratories. The machine has a large diameter material extrusionhead and subtractive machining capabilities. As of May 2014, voting on the various car modules (body, internal structure, etc.) was completed. Fabrication of body and structural components using the ORNL machine is planned for the InternationalMachine Technology Show in September 2014. Several automotive manufacturers use AM parts on concept cars and for other purposes. Hyundai used PBF to fabricate ﬂooring components for their QarmaQconcept car in 2007, with assistance from Freedom of Creation. Bentley uses PBF toproduce some specialty parts that are subsequently covered in leather or wood.Others use AM to fabricate replacement parts for antique cars, including Jay Leno’s famous garage ( www.jaylenosgarage.com ). BMW uses ME extensively in produc- tion, as ﬁxtures and tooling for automotive assembly. In consumer-oriented industries, many specialty applications are beginning to emerge. Many service bureaus do DDM runs for customized or other specialtycomponents. An interesting class of applications is emerging to bridge the virtualand physical worlds. The World of Warcraft is probably the largest online videogame. Players can design their own characters for use in the virtual world, oftenadding elaborate clothing, accessories, and weapons. A company called FigurePrints ( www.ﬁgureprints.com ) produces 100 mm (4 in.) tall models of such characters; one example was shown in Fig. 3.3. They use binder jetting (BJ) machines from 3D Systems (formerly ZCorp BJ machines), with color printingcapabilities, and sell characters for around $100 USD. Similarly, they also marketfabrication services for constructions in Minecraft, a “world building” game that isvery popular with children. Jujups offers custom Christmas ornaments, printed witha person’s photograph. Again, color printers from 3D Systems are used for produc-tion. In many of these applications, AM can utilize the input data only after it has been converted to a usable form, as the original data was created to serve a visual purpose and not necessarily as a representation of a true 3D object. However,software producers are beginning to consider AM as an output of their gamesfrom the outset, as is evident by the Spore video game, which enables users tocreate characters that are fully deﬁned in three dimensions and thus can beconverted into data usable by AM technologies in a straightforward manner. Withina year after the release of the game, it was announced that players could have a 3Dprintout of their character, using color BJ machines, for less than $50 USD. The gaming industry alone accounts for hundreds of millions of unique 3D virtual creations that consumers may want to have made into physical objects.382 16 Direct Digital ManufacturingJust as the development of computer graphics has often been driven by the gaming industry, it is appearing equally likely that the further development of color DDMtechnologies may also be driven by the market opportunities which are enabled by the gaming industry. Quite a few online games allow players to create or customize their own characters. Tools such as Maya are used to create/modify geometry,colors, textures, etc. which are then uploaded to the game site (e.g., Dota 2 fromValve). These same ﬁles can be packaged and sent to AM service providers, such asShapeways and Sculpteo, for printing color models of the custom characters. MakeMagazine ran a very informative article on this topic in 2013 [ 7]. In addition to the previous lines, many other DDM applications are emerging; including in the medical and dental industries, which will be discussed further in Chap. 15. Other examples are covered in Chaps. 2,11and17. 16.4 DDM Drivers It is useful to generalize from these examples and explore how the unique capabilities of AM technologies may lead to new DDM applications. The factorsthat enable DDM applications include: Unique Shapes: parts with customized shapes. Complex Shapes: improved performance.• Lot Size of One: economical to fabricate customized parts. Fast Turnaround: save time and costs; increase customer satisfaction. Digital Manufacturing: precisely duplicate CAD model.• Digital Record: have reusable dataset.• Electronic “Spare Parts”: fabricate spare parts on demand, rather than holding inventory. No Hard Tooling: no need to design, fabricate, and inventory tools; economical low-volume production. As indicated in the Align Technology and hearing aid examples, the capability to create customized, unique geometries is an important factor for DDM. Many AM processes are effective at fabricating platforms full of parts, essentially performingmass customization of parts. For example, 100 aligner molds ﬁt on one SLA-7000platform. Each has a unique geometry. Approximately 25–30 hearing aid shells canﬁt in the high-resolution region of an SLA Viper Si2 machine. Upwards of 4,000hearing aid shells can be built in one PBF powder bed in one build. The medicaldevice industry is a leading—and growing—industry where DDM and rapid tooling applications are needed due to the capability of fabricating patient-speciﬁc geometries. The capability of building parts with complex geometries is another beneﬁt of DDM. Features can be built into hearing aid shells that could not have been moldedin, due to constraints in removing the shells from their molds. In many cases, it ispossible to combine several parts into one DDM part due to AM’s complexity16.4 DDM Drivers 383capabilities. This can lead to tremendous cost savings in assembly tooling and assembly operations that would be required if multiple parts were fabricated usingconventional manufacturing processes. Complexity capabilities also enable new design paradigms, as discussed with respect to acetabular cups and as seen in Chap. 17. These new design concepts will be increasingly realized in the near future. Related to the unique geometry capability of AM, economical lot sizes of one are another important DDM capability. Since no tooling is required in DDM, there is noneed to amortize investments over many production parts. DDM also avoids theextensive process planning that can be required for machining, so time and costs areoften signiﬁcantly reduced. These factors and others help make small lot sizes economical for DDM. Fast turnaround is another important beneﬁt of DDM. Again, little time must be spent in process planning, tooling can be avoided, and AM machines build manyparts at once. All these properties lead to time savings when DDM is used. It iscommon for hearing aid manufacturers to deliver new hearings aids in less than1 week from the time a patient visits an audiologist. Align Technology must delivernew aligners to patients every 1–2 weeks. Rapid response to customer needs is ahallmark of AM technologies and DDM takes advantage of this capability. The capability of digital manufacturing , or precisely fabricating a mathematical model, has important applications in several areas. The medical device industrytakes advantage of this; hearing aid shells must ﬁt the patient’s ear canal well, theshape of which is described mathematically. This is also important in artwork andhigh-end housewares, where small shape changes dictated by manufacturinglimitations (e.g., draft angles for injection molding) may be unwelcome. Moregenerally, the concept of digital manufacturing enables digital archiving of thedesign and manufacturing information associated with the part. This information can be transferred electronically anywhere in the world for part production, which can have important implications for global enterprises. Adigital record is similar in many ways to the digital manufacturing capability just discussed. The emphasis here is on the capability to archive the designinformation associated with a part. Consider a medical device that is unique to apatient (e.g., hearing aid, foot orthotic). The part design can be a part of the patient’sdigital medical records, which streamlines record keeping, sharing of records, andfabricating replacement parts. Another way of explaining digital records and manufacturing, for engineered parts, is by using the phrase “electronic spare parts.” The air handling ductsinstalled on F-18 ﬁghters as part of an avionics upgrade program may be ﬂyingfor another 20 years. During that time, if replacement ducts are needed, Boeingmust manufacture the spare parts. If the duct components were molded or stamped,the molds or stamps must be retrieved from a warehouse to fabricate some spares.By having digital records and no tooling, it is much easier to fabricate the spareparts using AM processes; plus the fabrication can occur wherever it is most convenient. This ﬂexibility in selecting fabrication facilities and locations is impos- sible if hard tooling must be used.384 16 Direct Digital ManufacturingAs mentioned several times, the advantages are numerous and signiﬁcant to not requiring tooling for part fabrication. Note that in cases such as Align Technology, tooling is required, but the tooling itself is fabricated when and where needed, not requiring tooling inventories. The elimination of tooling makes DDM economically competitive across many applications for small lot size production. 16.5 Manufacturing Versus Prototyping Production manufacturing environments and practices are much more rigorous thanprototyping environments and practices. Certiﬁcation of equipment, materials, and personnel, quality control, and logistics are all critical in a production environment. Even small considerations like part packaging can be much different than in aprototyping environment. Table 16.1 compares and contrasts prototyping and production practices for several primary considerations [ 8]. Certiﬁcation is critical in a production environment. Customers must have a dependable source of manufactured parts with guaranteed properties. The DDMcompany must carefully maintain their equipment, periodically calibrate the equip-ment, and ensure it is always running within speciﬁcations. Processes must be engineered and not left to the informal care of a small number of skilled technicians. Experimentation on production parts is not acceptable. Meticulous records must bekept for quality assurance and traceability concerns. Personnel must be fullytrained, cross-trained to ensure some redundancy, and certiﬁed to deliver qualityparts. Most, if not all, DDM companies are ISO 9000 compliant or certiﬁed. ISO 9000 is an international standard for quality systems and practices. Most customers willrequire such ISO 9000 practices so that they can depend on their suppliers. Many books have been written on the ISO standards so, rather than go into extensive detail here, readers should utilize these books to learn more about this topic [ 9]. As mentioned, personnel should be trained, certiﬁed, and periodically retrained and/or recertiﬁed. Cross-training personnel on various processes and equipmenthelps mitigate risks of personnel being unavailable at critical times. If multipleshifts are run, these issues become more important, since the quality must beconsistent across all shifts. Vertical integration is important, since many customers will want their suppliers to be “one stop shops” for their needs. DDM companies may rely on their own suppliers, so the supplier network may be tiered. It is up to the DDM company,however, to identify their suppliers for specialty operations, such as bonding,coating, and assembly, and ensure that their suppliers are certiﬁed. The bottom line for a company wanting to break into the DDM industry is that they must become a production manufacturing organization, with rigorouspractices. Having an informal, prototyping environment, even if they can producehigh-quality prototypes, is not sufﬁcient for success in the current DDM industry. Standard production business practices must be adopted.16.5 Manufacturing Versus Prototyping 385Several industry standards, e.g., ISO 9000, have been available to assist companies in adopting quality and certiﬁcation best practices. Until recently, fewAM-speciﬁc standards were available, which meant that: Material data reported by various companies are not comparable. Technology users employ different process parameters to operate their equip- ment according to their own preferences. There is little repeatability of results between suppliers or service bureaus.• There are few speciﬁcations which can be referenced by end users to help them ensure that a product is built as-desired. In 2008, an international standards-development initiative was organized by the Society of Manufacturing Engineering; ASTM International was selected to be the organization that the AM community would work with to develop standards. The ﬁrst meeting of the ASTM F42 committee on standards for Additive ManufacturingTechnologies was held in May, 2009. At present, several standards have beenTable 16.1 Contrast between rapid prototyping and direct digital manufacturinga Key characteristic RP company DDM company Certiﬁcation Equipment From equipment manufacturer Production machines and calibration equipment Personnel No formal testing, certiﬁcation, or training typicalOn-going need for certiﬁcation Practices Trial-and-error, no formal documentation of practicesFormal testing for each critical step, periodic recertiﬁcation Quality Basic procedures; some inspection ISO 9000 compliance.

Qualiﬁed suppliers must be lined up ahead of time to enable integration aMuch of this section was adapted from Brian Hasting’s presentation at the 2007 SME RAPID Conference [ 8]386 16 Direct Digital Manufacturingadopted and many more are under development. Standard terminology, the AMF, reporting data for test specimens, and some speciﬁcations for PBF fabricated partshave been developed. Additional standards are being developed related to powder characterization, material qualiﬁcation and traceability, parts fabricated by material extrusion and other processes, and design guidelines. With the adoption of anoverall framework for AM-related standards, the F42 committee has a plan todevelop an array of standards that will address all of the issues raised in the bulletitems above. 16.6 Cost Estimation From a cost perspective, AM can appear to be much more expensive for partmanufacture than conventional, mass production processes. A single part out of alarge VP or PBF machine can cost upwards of $5,000, if the part ﬁlls much of thematerial chamber. However, if parts are smaller, the time and cost of a build can bedivided among all the parts built at one time. For small parts, such as the hearing aid shell, costs can be only several dollars or less. In this section, we will develop a simple cost model that applies to production manufacturing. A major component ofcosts is the time required to fabricate a set of parts; as such, a detailed build timemodel will be presented. 16.6.1 Cost Model Broadly speaking, costs fall into four main categories: machine purchase, machineoperation, material, and labor costs. In equation form, this high level cost model canbe expressed, on a per-build basis, as: Cost¼PþOþMþL ð16:1Þ or, on a per-part basis, as Cost¼pþoþmþl¼1=N/C2PþOþMþL ðÞ ð 16:2Þ where, P¼machine purchase cost allocated to the build, O¼machine operation cost, M¼material cost, L¼labor cost, N¼number of parts in the build, and the lower-case letters are the per-part costs corresponding to the per-build costsexpressed using capital letters. An important assumption made in this analysis is that all parts in one build are the same kind of part, with roughly the same shape and size. This simpliﬁes the allocation of times and costs to the parts in a build. Machine purchase and operations costs are based on the build time of the part. We can assume a useful life of the machine, denoted Y years, and apportion thepurchase price equally to all years. Note that this is a much different approach thanwould be taken in a cash-ﬂow model, where the actual payments on the machine16.6 Cost Estimation 387would be used (assuming it was ﬁnanced or leased). A typical up-time percentage needs to be assumed also. For our purposes, we will assume a 95 % up-time (themachine builds parts 95 % of the time during a year). Then, purchase price for one build can be calculated as: P¼Purchaseprice /C2Tb 0:95/C224/C2365/C2Yð16:3Þ where Tbis the time for the build in hours and 24 /C2365 represents the number of hours in a year. Operation cost is simply the build time multiplied by the cost rate ofthe machine, which can be a complicated function of machine maintenance, utilitycosts, cost of factory ﬂoor space, and company overhead, where the operation costrate is denoted by C o. O¼Tb/C2Co ð16:4Þ Material cost is conceptually simple to determine. It is the volume, v, of the part multiplied by the cost of the material per unit mass, Cm, and the mass density, ρ,a s given in ( 16.5). For AM technologies that use powders, however, material cost can be considerably more difﬁcult to determine. The recyclability of material that is used, the volume fraction of the build that is made up of parts versus loose powder (in the case of powder bed techniques) and/or the powder capture efﬁciency of theprocess (in the case of directed energy deposition techniques) will result in the needto multiply the volume, v, of the part by a factor ranging from a low of 1.0 to a number as high as 7.0 to accurately capture the true cost of material consumed.Thus, for powder processes where the build material is not 100 % recyclable,material cost has a complex dependency on the various factors mentioned here.The term k rwill be introduced for the purpose of modeling the additional material consumption that considers these factors. In addition, for processes that require support materials (such as ME and VP), the volume and cost of the supports neededto create each part must also be taken into account. The factor k stakes this into account for such processes; typical values would range from 1.1 to 1.5 to includethe extra material volume needed for supports. As a result, the model described in(16.5) will be used for material cost. M¼k s/C2kr/C2N/C2v/C2Cm/C2ρ ð16:5Þ Labor cost is the labor rate, Clin $/h, multiplied by the time, Tl, required for workers to set up the build, remove fabricated parts, clean the parts, clean themachine, and get the machine ready for the next build. L¼T 1/C2C1 ð16:6Þ388 16 Direct Digital Manufacturing16.6.2 Build Time Model The major variable in this cost model is the build time of the parts. Build time ( Tb)i s a function of part size, part shape, number of parts in the build, and the machine’s build speed. Viewed slightly differently, build time is the sum of scan or deposition time ( Ts), transition time between layers ( Tt), and delay time ( Te): Tb¼TsþTtþTe ð16:7Þ For this analysis, we will assume that we are given the part size in terms of its volume, v, and its bounding box, aligned with the coordinate axes: bb x,b b y,b b z. Layer transition time is the easiest to deal with. The processes that build in materialbeds or vats have to recoat or deposit more material between layers; other processesdo not need to recoat and have a T rof 0. Recoat times for building support structures can be different than times for recoating when building parts, as indicated by ( 16.8). Tt¼Ls/C2TtsþLp/C2Ttp ð16:8Þ where Lsis the number of layers of support structure, Ttsis the time to recoat a layer of support structures, Lpis the number of layers for building parts ( Lp¼bbz/LT), Ttp is the recoat time for a part layer, and LT is the layer thickness. Scan/deposition time is a function of the total cross-sectional area for each layer, the scan or ﬁll strategy utilized, and the number of layers. Cross-sectional areadepends upon the part volume and the number of parts. Scan/deposition time alsodepends upon whether the machine has to scan vectors to build the part in a point-wise fashion, as in VP, PBF, ME, or the part deposits material in a wide, line-wiseswath, as in material jetting processes, or as a complete layer, as in layer-based(e.g., mask projection) vat photopolymerization processes. The equations are simi-lar; we will present the build time model for scanning and leave the wide swath deposition and layer-based scanning processes for the exercises. Now, we need to consider the part layout in the build chamber. Assuming a build platform, we have a 2D layout of parts on the platform. Parts are assumed to be ofsimilar sizes and are laid out in a rectangular grid according to their bounding boxsizes. Additionally, XandYgaps are speciﬁed so that the parts do not touch. In the event that the parts can nest inside one another, gaps with negative values can begiven. A 2D platform layout is shown in Fig. 16.5 showing the bounding boxes of 18 long, ﬂat parts with gaps of 10 mm in the Xdirection and 20 mm in the Ydirection. The number of parts on the platform can be computed as: N¼ PLxþgx/C020 bbxþgx/C18/C19PLyþgy/C020 bbyþgy ! ð16:9Þ where PL x,P L yare the platform sizes in XandY,gx,gyare the XandYgaps, and the /C020 mm terms prevent parts from being built at the edges of the platform (10 mm16.6 Cost Estimation 389buffer area along each platform edge). This analysis can be extended to 3D build chambers for processes which enable stacking in the zdirection. The time to scan one part depends on the part cross-sectional area, the laser or deposition head diameter d, the distance between scans h, and the average scan speed ss avg. Cross-sectional area, Aavg, is approximated by using an area correction factor γ[10], which corrects the area based on the ratio of the actual part volume to the bounding box volume, vbb,γ¼v/vbb. The following correction has been shown to give reasonable results in many cases. Afn¼γ/C1eα1/C0γðÞð16:10Þ Aavg¼bbx/C2bby/C2Afn ð16:11Þ where αis typically taken as 1.5. For scanning processes, it is necessary to determine the total scan length per layer. This can be accomplished by simply dividing the cross-sectional area by thediameter of the laser beam or deposited ﬁlament. Alternatively, the scan length canbe determined by dividing the cross-sectional area by the hatch spacing (distancebetween scans). We will use the latter approach, where the hatch spacing, hr,i s given as a percentage of the laser beam diameter. For support structures, we willassume that the amount of support is a constant percentage, supfac, of the cross-sectional area (assumed as about 30 %). If a process does not require supports, then the constant percentage can be taken as 0. The ﬁnal consideration is the number of times a layer is scanned to fabricate a layer, denoted n st. For example, in stereolithography, both Xand Yscans are performed for each layer, while in Fig. 16.5 SLA-7000 vat with 18 parts laid out on the platform390 16 Direct Digital Manufacturingmaterial extrusion, only one scan is performed to deposit material. Scan length for one part and its support structure is determined using ( 16.12 ): sl¼AavgnstLp hr/C1dþsupfacLs d/C18/C19 ð16:12Þ The ﬁnal step in determining scan/deposition time is to determine scan speed. This is a function of how fast the laser or deposition head moves when depositingmaterial, ss s, as well as when moving (jumping) between scans, ss j. In some cases, jump speed is much higher than typical scan speeds. To complicate thismatter, many machines have a wide range of scan speeds that depend on several part building details. For example, new VP machines have scan speeds that range from 100 to 25,000 mm/s. For our purposes, we will assume a typical scan speedthat is half of the maximum speed. The average scan/deposition speed will becorrected using the area correction factor determined earlier [ 10]a s ss avg¼sss/C2γþssj1/C0γðÞ ð 16:13Þ With the intermediate terms determined, we can compute the scan/deposition time for all parts in the build as: Ts¼N/C2sl 3, 600 ss avgð16:14Þ where the 3,600 in the denominator converts from seconds to hours. The ﬁnal term in the build time expression ( 16.7) is the delay time, Te. Many processes have delays built into their operations, such as platform move time,pre-recoat delay ( T predelay ), post-recoat delay ( Tpostdelay ), nozzle cleaning, sensor recalibration, temperature set point delays (waiting for the layer to heat or cool towithin a speciﬁed range), and more. These delays are often user speciﬁed and depend upon build details for a particular process. For example, in VP, if parts have many ﬁne features, longer pre-recoat delays may be used to allow the resin tocure further, to strengthen the part, before subjecting fragile features to recoatingstresses. Additionally, some processes require a start-up time, for example, to heatthe build chamber or warm up a laser. This start-up time will be denoted T start. For our purposes, delays will be given by ( 16.15 ), but it is important to realize that each process and machine may have additional or different delay terms. Te¼LpTpredelay þTpredelay/C0/C1 þTstart ð16:15Þ With the cost and build time models presented, we now turn to the application of these models to VP.16.6 Cost Estimation 39116.6.3 Laser Scanning Vat Photopolymerization Example The build time and cost models presented in Sect. 16.6.2 will be applied to the case of hearing aid shell manufacturing using an iPro 8000 SLA Centerstereolithography machine from 3D Systems with the smallest vat. The machineparameters are given in Table 16.2. Part information will be assumed to be as follows: bounding box ¼15/C212/C220 mm, v¼1,000 mm An average cross- sectional area of 45 mm2will be assumed, instead of using Eqs. ( 16.10 ) and (16.11 ). Layer thickness for the part is 0.05 mm. Support structures are assumed to be 10 mm tall, built with 0.1 mm layer thickness. Since the shell’s walls aresmall, most of the scans will be border vectors; thus, an average laser beamdiameter of 0.21 mm is assumed. Gaps of 4 mm will be used between shells. With these values assumed and given, the build time will be computed ﬁrst, followed by the cost per shell. We start with the total number of parts on oneplatform N¼ 650þ4/C020 15þ4/C18/C19350þ4/C020 12þ4/C18/C19 ¼1, 393 The numbers of layers of part and support structure are Lp¼400 and Ls¼100.

Machine purchase price allocated to the build is $212. Operating cost for 25.8 h is $774. Material and labor costs for the build are $245 and $10, respectively. The total cost for the build is computed to be $1,241.With 1,393 shells in the build, each shell costs about $0.89, which is pretty lowconsidering that the hearing aid will retail for $400 to $1,500. However these costsdo not include support removal and ﬁnishing costs, nor the life-cycle costsdiscussed below. 16.7 Life-Cycle Costing In addition to part costs, it is important to consider the costs incurred over thelifetime of the part, from both the customer’s and the supplier’s perspectives. Forany manufactured part (not necessarily using AM processes), life-cycle costs associated with the part can be broken down into six main categories: equipment cost, material cost, operation cost, tooling cost, service cost, and retirement cost. Asin Sect. 16.6, equipment cost includes the costs to purchase the machine(s) used to manufacture the part. Material and operation costs are related to the actualmanufacturing process and are one-time costs associated only with one particularpart. For most conventional manufacturing processes, tooling is required for partfabrication. This may include an injection mold, stamping dies, or machiningﬁxtures. The ﬁnal two costs, service and retirement, are costs that accrue over the lifetime of the part. This section will focus on tooling, service, and retirement costs, since they have not been addressed yet. Service costs typically include costs associated withrepairing or replacing a part, which can include costs related to taking the productout of service, disassembling the product to gain access to the part, repairing orreplacing the part, re-assembling the product, and possibly testing the product.16.7 Life-Cycle Costing 393Design-for-service guidelines indicate that parts needing frequent service should be easy to access and easy to repair or replace. Service-related costs are also associatedwith warranty costs, which can be signiﬁcant for consumer products. Let’s consider the interactions between service and tooling costs. Typically, tooling is considered for part manufacture. However, tooling is also needed tofabricate replacement parts. If a certain injection molded part starts to fail in aircraftafter being in service for 25 years, it is likely that no replacement parts are available“off the shelf.” As a result, new parts must be molded. This requires tooling to belocated or fabricated anew, refurbished to ensure it is production-worthy, installed,and tested. Assuming the tooling is available, the company would have had to storeit in a warehouse for all of those years, which necessitates the construction and maintenance of a warehouse of old tools that may never be used. In contrast, if the parts were originally manufactured using AM, no physical tooling need be stored, located, refurbished, etc. It will be necessary to maintain anelectronic model of the part, which can be a challenge since forms of media becomeoutdated; however, maintenance of a computer ﬁle is much easier and less expen-sive than a large, heavy tool. This aspect of life-cycle costs heavily favors AMprocesses. Retirement costs are associated with taking a product out of service, dismantling it, and disposing of it. Large product dismantling facilities exist in many parts of the USA and the world that take products apart, separate parts into different materialstreams, and separate materials for distribution to recyclers, incinerators, andlandﬁlls. The ﬁrst challenge for such facilities is collecting the discarded products.A good example of product collection is a community run electronic waste collec-tion event, where people can discard old electronic products at a central location,such as a school or mall parking lot. Product take-back legislation in Europe offers adifferent approach for the same objective. For automobiles, an infrastructure already exists to facilitate disposal and recycling of old cars. For most other industries, little organized product take-back infrastructure exists in the USA,with the exceptions of paper and plastic food containers. In contrast to consumerproducts, recycling and disposal infrastructure exists for industrial equipment andwastes, particularly for metals, glass, and some plastics. How recyclable are materials used in AM? Metals are very recyclable regardless of the method used to process it into a part. Thus, stainless steel, titanium alloys,and other metal parts fabricated in PBF and directed energy deposition processes can be recycled. For plastics, the situation is more complicated. The nylon blends used in PBF can be recycled, in principle. However, nylon is not as easily recycledas other common thermoplastics, such as the ABS or polycarbonate materials fromME systems. Thermoset polymers, such as photopolymers in VP and jettingprocesses, cannot be recycled. These materials can only be used as ﬁllers, landﬁlled,or incinerated. In general, the issue of life-cycle costing has simple aspects to it, but is also very complicated. It is clear that the elimination of hard tooling for part manufacture is a signiﬁcant beneﬁt of AM technologies, both at the time of part manufacture and over the part’s lifetime since spare parts can be manufactured when needed. On the394 16 Direct Digital Manufacturingother hand, issues of material recycling and disposal become more complicated, reﬂecting the various industry and consumer practices across society. 16.8 Future of DDM There is no question that we will see increasing utilization of AM technologies in production manufacturing. In the near-term, it is likely that new applications will continue to take advantage of the shape complexity capabilities for economical lowproduction volume manufacturing. Longer time frames will see emergence ofapplications that take advantage of functional complexity capabilities (e.g.,mechanisms, embedded components) and material complexities. To date, tens of thousands of parts have been manufactured for the aerospace industry. Many of these parts are ﬂying on military aircraft, space shuttles, theInternational Space Station, and many satellites. Several small AM service companies have been created to serve the aerospace market. Other service bureaus revamped their operations to compete in this market. The machine vendors havereconceptualized some of their machine designs to better serve manufacturingmarkets. An example of this is the development of the 3D Systems SinterStationPro, and the similar public announcements by EOS that all future models of theirmachines will be designed with production manufacturing in mind. Flame-resistantnylon materials have been developed to enable parts manufacturing for commercialaircraft, as well as higher-temperature and higher-recyclability materials. Other markets will emerge: One needs only consider the array of devices and products that are customized for our bodies to see more opportunities that are similar to aligners and hearingaids. From eye glasses and other lenses to dentures and other dental restorations,to joint replacements, the need for complex, customized geometries, hierarchicalstructures and complex material compositions is widespread in medical andhealth related areas. New design interfaces for non-experts have enabled individuals to design and purchase their own personal communication/computing device (e.g., cellphones) housings or covers in a manner similar to their current ability to havea physical representation of their virtual gaming characters produced. Filesharing sites such as thingiverse.com and storefronts such as shapeways.comare very popular and many expansions and generalizations are to be expected. Structural components will have embedded sensors that detect fatigue and material degradation, warning of possible failures before they occur. The opportunities are bounded only by the imagination of those using AM technologies. In summary, the capability to process material in an additive manner will drastically change some industries and produce new devices that could not bemanufactured using conventional technologies. This will have a lasting and16.8 Future of DDM 395profound impact upon the way that products are manufactured and distributed, and thus on society as a whole. A further discussion of how DDM will likely affectbusiness models, distributed manufacturing and entrepreneurship is contained in the ﬁnal chapter of this book. 16.9 Exercises Estimate the build time and cost for a platform of 100 aligner mold parts in an iPro 8000 SLA Center (see Chap. 4). Assume that the bounding box for each part is 11 /C212/C28 cm and the mold volume is 75,000 mm3. Assume a scanning speed of 5,000 mm/s and a jump speed of 20,000 mm/s. All remaining quantities are given in Sect. 16.6. What is the estimated cost per mold (two parts)? A vat of hearing aid shells is to be built in an SLS Pro 140 machine (build platform size: 550 /C2550/C2460 mm). How many hearing aid shells can ﬁt in this build platform? Determine the estimated build time and cost for this buildplatform full of shells. Assume laser scan and jump speed of 5,000 mm/s and20,000 mm/s, respectively. Assume the laser spot size is 0.2 mm, layerthicknesses are 0.1 mm, and only 1 scanning pass per layer is needed ( n st¼1). Assume 4 mm gaps in X,Y, and Zdirections. Recall that no support structures are needed. Assume that the SLS machine needs 2 h to warm up and 2 h to cooldown after the build. Assume that T predelay is 15 s and Tpostdelay is 2 s. Develop a build time model for a jetting machine, such as the Eden models from Stratasys or the ProJets from 3D Systems. Note that this is a line-type process, incontrast to the point-wise vector scanning process used in VP or PBF. Considerthat the jetting head can print material during each traversal of the build area andn stmay be 2 or 3 (e.g., two or three passes of the head are required to fully cover the total build area). Assume that Tpredelay andTpostdelay are 2 s. Estimate the build time and cost for a platform of hearing aid shells in an Eden 500 V machine (see Chap. 7). What is the estimated cost per shell? You will need to visit the Stratasys web site and possibly contact Stratasys personnel in order toacquire all necessary information for computing times and costs. Develop a build time model for an ME machine from Stratasys, such as the Fortus 900mc. Note that this is a point-wise vector process without overlappingscans. Scan speeds can be up to 1,000 mm/s. Assume that a warm-up time of 0.5 h is needed to heat the build chamber. Assume that T predelay andTpostdelay are 1s . Estimate the build time and cost for a platform of hearing aid shells in a Fortus 900mc material extrusion machine. What is the estimated cost per shell? Youwill need to visit the Stratasys web site and possibly contact Stratasys personnelin order to acquire all necessary information for computing times and costs. Modify the model for purchase cost to incorporate net present value considerations. Rework the hearing aid shell example in Sect. 16.6.2 to use net present value. What is the estimated cost of a shell?396 16 Direct Digital Manufacturing8. Bentley Motors has a production volume of 10,000 cars per year, over its four main models. Production volume per model per year ranges from about 200 to4,500. Since each car may sell for $120,000 to over $500,000, each car is highly customized. Write a one-page essay on the DDM implications of such a busi- ness. The engines for these cars are shared with another car manufacturer; assuch, do not focus your essay on the engines. Rather, focus on the chassis,interiors, and other parts of the car that customers will see and interact with.

However, the capabilities of addi-tive manufacturing technologies provide an opportunity to rethink DFM to takeadvantage of the unique capabilities of these technologies. As mentioned in Chap. 16, several companies are now using AM technologies for production manufacturing. For example, Siemens, Phonak, Widex, and the other hearing aidmanufacturers use selective laser sintering and stereolithography machines toproduce hearing aid shells; Align Technology uses stereolithography to fabricatemolds for producing clear dental braces (“aligners”); and Boeing and itssuppliers use polymer powder bed fusion (PBF) to produce ducts and similarparts for F-17 ﬁghter jets. For hearing aids and dental aligners, AM machinesenable manufacturing of tens to hundreds of thousands of parts, where each part is uniquely customized based upon person-speciﬁc geometric data. In the case of aircraft components, AM technology enables low-volume manufacturing, easyintegration of design changes and, at least as importantly, piece part reductionsto greatly simplify product assembly. The unique capabilities of AM include: shape complexity , in that it is possible to build virtually any shape; hierarchical complexity , in that hierarchical multiscale structures can be designed and fabricated from the microstructurethrough geometric mesostructure (sizes in the millimeter range) to the part-scale macrostructure; material complexity , in that material can be processed one point, or one layer, at a time; and functional complexity , in that fully functional assemblies and mechanisms can be fabricated directly using AM processes.These unique capabilities enable new opportunities for customization, verysigniﬁcant improvements in product performance, multifunctionality, andlower overall manufacturing costs. These capabilities will be expanded uponin Sects. 17.3 and17.4. #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I.

These capabilities will be expanded upon inSect. 17.3. In this chapter, we begin with a brief look at DFM to draw contrasts with Design for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM). A considerable part of the chapter is devotedto the unique capabilities of AM technologies and a variety of illustrations of thesecapabilities. We cover the emerging area of engineered cellular materials and relateit to AM’s unique capabilities. Perhaps the most exciting aspect of AM is the designfreedom that is enabled; we illustrate this with several examples from the area ofindustrial design (housewares, consumer products) that exhibit unique approachesto product design, resulting in geometries that can be fabricated only using AM processes. The limitations of current computer-aided design (CAD) tools are discussed, and thoughts on capabilities and technologies needed for DFAM are 1Design for manufacturing is typically abbreviated DFM, whereas design for manufacture and assembly is typically abbreviated as DFMA. To avoid confusion with the abbreviation for design for additive manufacturing (DFAM), we have utilized the shorter abbreviation DFM to encompassboth design for manufacture and design for assembly.400 17 Design for Additive Manufacturingpresented. The chapter concludes with a discussion of design synthesis approaches to optimize designs. 17.2 Design for Manufacturing and Assembly Design for manufacturing and assembly can be deﬁned as the practice of designing products to reduce, and hopefully minimize, manufacturing and assembly difﬁculties and costs. This makes perfectly good sense, as why would one want toincrease costs? However, DFM requires extensive knowledge of manufacturing andassembly processes, supplier capabilities, material behavior, etc. DFM, althoughsimple conceptually, can be difﬁcult and time consuming to apply. To achieve theobjectives of DFM, researchers and companies have developed a large number ofmethods, tools, and practices. Our purpose in this chapter is not to cover the widespectrum of DFM advances; rather, it is to convey a sense of the variety of DFM approaches so that we can compare and contrast DFAM with DFM. Broadly speaking, DFM efforts can be classiﬁed into three categories: Industry practices, including reorganization of product development using integrated product teams, concurrent engineering, and the like Collections of DFM rules and practices• University research in DFM methods, tools, and environments During the 1980s and 1990s, much of the product development industry underwent signiﬁcant changes in structuring product development organizations[1]. Companies such as Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, and Ford reorganized product development into teams of designers, engineers, manufacturing personnel, andpossibly other groups; these teams could have hundreds or even thousands ofpeople. The idea was to ensure good communication among the team so that designdecisions could be made with adequate information about manufacturing processes,factory ﬂoor capabilities, and customer requirements. Concurrently, manufacturing engineers could understand decision rationale and start process planning and tooling development to prepare for the in-progress designs. A signiﬁcant driver ofthis restructuring was to identify conﬂicts early in the product development processand reduce the need for redesign or, even worse, retooling of manufacturingprocesses after production starts. The second category of DFM work, that of DFM rules and practices, is best exempliﬁed by the Handbook for Product Design for Manufacture [ 2]. The 1986 edition of this handbook was over 950 pages long, with detailed descriptions of engineering materials, manufacturing processes, and rules-of-thumb. Extensive examples of good and bad practices are offered for product design for many ofthese manufacturing processes, such as molding, stamping, casting, forging,machining, and assembly. University research during the 1980s and 1990s started with the development of tools and metrics for part manufacture and assembly. The Boothroyd and Dewhurst17.2 Design for Manufacturing and Assembly 401toolkit is probably the most well-known example [ 3]. The main concept was to develop simple tools for designers to evaluate the manufacturability of theirdesigns. For example, injection molding DFM tools were developed that asked designers to identify how many undercuts were in a part, how much geometric detail is in a part, how many tight tolerances were needed, and similar information.From this information, the tool provided assessments of manufacturabilitydifﬁculties, costs estimates, and provided some suggestions about part redesign.Similar tools and metrics were developed for many manufacturing and assemblyprocesses, based in part on the Handbook mentioned above, and similar collectionsof information. Some of these tools and methods were manual, while others wereautomated; some were integrated into CAD systems and performed automated recognition of difﬁculties. For instance, Boothroy Dewhurst, Inc. markets a set of software tools that help designers conceive and modify their design to achievelower-cost parts, taking into account the speciﬁc manufacturing process beingutilized. In addition, they sell software tools which help designers improve thedesign of assembled components through identiﬁcation of the key functionalrequirements of an assembled component; leading the designer through a processof design modiﬁcations with the aim of minimizing the number of parts andassembly operations used to create that assembled component. The work in this area is extensive; see for example, the ASME Journal of Mechanical Design and the ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences proceedings sincethe mid-1980s (see e.g., [ 4]). The extensive efforts on DFM over many years are an indication of the difﬁculty and pervasiveness of the issues surrounding DFM. In effect, DFM is about thedesigner understanding the constraints imposed by manufacturing processes, thendesigning products to minimize constraint violation. Some of these difﬁculties arelessened when parts are manufactured by AM technologies, but some are not. Integrated product development teams that practice concurrent engineering make sense, regardless of intended manufacturing processes. Rules, methods, and toolsthat assist designers in making good decisions about product manufacturabilityhave a signiﬁcant role to play. However, the nature of the rules, methods, and toolsshould change to assist designers in understanding the design freedom allowed byAM and, potentially, aiding the designer in exploring the resulting open designspaces, while ensuring that manufacturing constraints (yes, AM technologies dohave constraints) are not violated. To illustrate the differences between DFM and DFAM, this section will con- clude with two examples. The ﬁrst involves typical injection moldingconsiderations, that of undercuts and feature detail. Consider the camera spoolpart shown in Fig. 17.1 [5]. The various ribs and pockets are features that contribute to the time and cost of machining the mold in which the spools will be molded. Suchfeature detail is not relevant to AM processes since ribs can be added easily duringprocessing in an AM machine. A similar result relates to undercuts. This spooldesign has at least one undercut, since it cannot be oriented in a mold consisting of only two mold pieces (core and cavity), while enabling the mold halves to be separated and the part removed. Most probably, the spool will be oriented so that402 17 Design for Additive Manufacturingthe mold closure direction is parallel to the walls of the ribs. In this manner, the core and cavity mold halves form most of the spool features, including the ribs (or pockets), the ﬂanges near the ends, and the groove seen at the right end. In this orientation, the hole in the right end cannot be formed using the core and/or cavity. A third moving mold section, called a side action, is needed to form the hole. In AM processes, it is not necessary to be so concerned about the relative position and orientation of features, since, again, AM machines can fabricate features regardless of their position in the part. In design for assembly, two main considerations are often offered to reduce assembly time, cost, and difﬁculties: minimize the number of parts and eliminate fasteners. Both considerations translate directly to fewer assembly operations, the primary driver for assembly costs [ 3]. To minimize parts and fasteners, integrated part designs typically become much more complex and costly to manufacture. Design for manufacture and design for assembly will often be repeated, iteratively, until an optimal solution is found; one where the increasing manufacturing costs for more complex components are no longer compensated by the assembly cost savings. The designs in Fig. 17.2 show two very different approaches to designing ducts for aircraft [ 6,7]. This example represents a design concept for conveying cooling air to electronic units in military aircraft, but could apply to many different applications. The ﬁrst design is a typical approach using parts fabricated by conventional manufacturing processes (stamping, sheet metal forming, assembly using screws, etc.). In contrast, the approach on the right illustrates the beneﬁts of taking design for assembly guidelines to their extreme: the best way to reduce assembly difﬁculties and costs is to eliminate assembly operations altogether! The resulting design replaces 16 parts and fasteners with 1 part that exhibits integrated ﬂow vanes and other performance enhancing features. However, this integrated design cannot be fabricated using conventional manufacturing techniques and is only manufacturable using AM. Fig. 17.1 Camera spool example17.2 Design for Manufacturing and Assembly 40317.3 AM Unique Capabilities The layer-based additive nature of AM leads to unique capabilities in comparison with most other manufacturing processes. After explaining these uniquenesses,several examples and classes of applications will be presented in the next section. The unique capabilities mentioned at the beginning of the chapter were: Shape complexity: it is possible to build virtually any shape Hierarchical complexity: features can be designed with shape complexity across multiple size scales Functional complexity: functional devices (not just individual piece-parts) can be produced in one build Material complexity: material can be processed one point, or one layer, at a time as a single material or as a combination of materials To date, primarily shape complexity has been used to enable production of end-use parts, but applications taking advantage of the other capabilities, particu-larly material complexity, are being developed. 17.3.1 Shape Complexity In AM, the capability to fabricate a layer is unrelated to the layer’s shape. Forexample, the lasers in vat photopolymerization (VP) and powder bed fusion (PBF)original design with 16 parts consolidated design a b Fig. 17.2 Aircraft duct example404 17 Design for Additive Manufacturingprocesses can reach any point in a part’s cross section and process material there. As such, part complexity is virtually unlimited. This is in stark contrast to thelimitations imposed by machining or injection molding, two common processes. Inmachining, tool accessibility is a key limitation that governs part complexity. Ininjection molding, the need to separate mold pieces and eject parts greatly limitspart complexity. A related capability is to enable custom-designed geometries. In production using AM, it does not matter if one part has a different shape than the previously produced part. Furthermore, no hard tooling or ﬁxtures are necessary, which implies that lot sizes of one can be economically feasible. This is tremendouslypowerful for medical applications, for example, since everyone’s body shape isdifferent. Also, consider the design of a high-speed robot arm. High stiffness andlow weight are desired typically. With AM, the capability is enabled to put materialwhere it can be utilized best. The link from a commercial Adept robot (Cobra 600)shown in Fig. 17.3 has been stiffened with a custom-designed lattice structure that conforms to the link’s shape. Preliminary calculations show that weight reductions of 25 % are achieved readily with this lattice structure and that much greater improvements are possible. More generally, AM processes free designers frombeing limited to shapes that can be fabricated using conventional manufacturingprocesses. Another factor enabling lot sizes of one, and shape complexity, is the capability for automated process planning. Straightforward geometric operations can beperformed on AMF or STL ﬁles (or CAD models) to decompose the part modelinto operations that an AM machine can perform. Although CNC has improved greatly, many more manual steps are typically utilized in process planning and generating machine code for CNC than for AM. 17.3.2 Hierarchical Complexity Similar to shape complexity, AM enables the design of hierarchical complexityacross several orders of magnitude in length scale. This includes nano/ Fig. 17.3 Robot link stiffened with lattice structure17.3 AM Unique Capabilities 405microstructures, mesostructures, and part-scale macrostructures. We will start with material microstructures. One set of processes, which has been studied extensively with respect to hierar- chical complexity, are the directed energy deposition (DED) processes. In LENS, for instance, the nano/microstructure can be tailored in a particular location by controlling the size and cooling rate of the melt pool. As a result, the size and distribution of precipitates (nanoscale) and secondary particles (microscale), for example, can be changed by locally modifying the laser power and scan rate. Figure 17.4 illustrates the types of microstructural features which can be formed when using LENS to process mixtures of TiC in Ti to form a composite structure. There are several features of the microstructure which can be controlled. In cases of lower laser energy densities, there is a greater proportion of unmelted carbide (UMC) particles within the microstructure. At higher energy densities more of the TiC particles melt and precipitate as resolidiﬁed carbides (RSC). In addition, as the RSC have a different stoichiometry (TiC transforms to TiC 0.65); for a given initial mixture of TiC and Ti, the more RSC that is present in the ﬁnal microstruc- ture, the less Ti matrix material is present. The resulting microstructures can thus have very different material and mechanical properties. If sufﬁcient RSCs are precipitated to consume the Ti matrix material, then the structure becomes very brittle. In contrast, when most of the TiC is present as UMCs, the structure is more ductile but is less resistant to abrasive wear. In addition to the nano/microstructure illustration above, DED technologies have been shown to be capable of producing equiaxed, columnar, directionally solidiﬁed, and single-crystal grain structures. These various types of nano/ microstructures can be achieved by careful control of the process parameters for a particular material, and can vary from point to point within a structure. In many cases, for laser or electron beam PBF processes for metals, these variations are also Fig. 17.4 Sixty percent CP-Ti, 40 % TiC composite made using LENS. The ratio of un-melted carbides (UMCs) to resolidiﬁed carbides (RSCs) within the Ti matrix is controlled by varying LENS process parameters406 17 Design for Additive Manufacturingachievable. Similarly, by varying either the materials present (when using a multimaterial AM system) or the processing of the materials, this type of nano/microstructure control is also possible in ME, material jetting, VP, and sheetlamination AM technologies as well. These related possibilities are further exploredbelow with respect to material complexity. The ability to change the mesostructure of a part is typically associated with the application of cellular structures, such as honeycombs, foams, or lattices, to ﬁll certain regions of a geometry. This is often done to increase a part’s strength to weight or stiffness to weight ratio. These structures are discussed in more detail inSect. 17.5.2 . When considered together, the ability to simultaneously control a part’s nano/ microstructure, mesostructure, and macrostructure simply by changing processparameters and CAD data is a capability of AM which is unparalleled usingconventional manufacturing. 17.3.3 Functional Complexity When building parts in an additive manner, one always has access to the inside ofthe part. Two capabilities are enabled by this. First, by carefully controlling the fabrication of each layer, it is possible to fabricate operational mechanisms in some AM processes. By ensuring that clearances between links are adequate, revolute ortranslational joints can be created. Second, components have been inserted intoparts being built in VP, ME, PBF, sheet lamination, and other AM machines,enabling in situ assembly. A wide variety of kinematic joints has been fabricated directly in VP, ME, and PBF technologies, including vertical and horizontal prismatic, revolute, cylindrical,spherical, and Hooke joints. Figure 17.5 shows one example of a pulley-driven, snake-like robot with many revolute joints that was built as assembled in the SLA-3500 machine at Georgia Tech. Similar studies have been performed using material extrusion (ME) and PBF processes. The research group at Rutgers University led by Dr. Mavroidis [ 8] demonstrated that the same joint geometries could be fabricated by both ME andPBF machines and similar clearances were needed in both machine types. In PBF, Fig. 17.5 Pulley-driven snake-like robot17.3 AM Unique Capabilities 407loose powder must be removed from the joint locations to enable relative joint motion. In ME, the usage of soluble support material ensures that joints can bemovable after post-processing in a suitable solvent. In the construction of functional prototypes, it is often advantageous to embed components into parts while building them in AM machines. This avoids post-fabrication assembly and can greatly reduce the number of separate parts that have to be fabricated and assembled. For example, it is possible to fabricate VP devices with a wide range of embedded components, including small metal parts (bolts, nuts, bushing), electricmotors, gears, silicon wafers, printed circuit boards, and strip sensors. Furthermore,VP resins tend to adhere well to embedded components, reducing the need forfasteners. Shown in Fig. 17.6 is a model of an SLA-250 machine that was built in the SLA-250 at Georgia Tech [ 9]. This 150 /C2150/C2260 mm model was built at 1:¼ scale, with seven inserted components, four sliding contact joints, and one rotating contact joint. The recoating blade slides back-and-forth across the vat region, driven by an electric motor and gear train. Similarly, the elevator and platformtranslate vertically, driven by a second electric motor and leadscrew. The laserpointer and galvanometers worked to draw patterns on the platform, but these threecomponents were assembled after the build, rather than subjecting them to beingdipped into the resin vat. Build time was approximately 75 h, including time topause the build and insert components. Other researchers have also demonstrated the capability of building functional devices, including the Mavroidis group and Dr. Cutkosky’s group at Stanford University [ 10]. Device complexity is greatly facilitated when the capability to Motor & Leadscrew part 2Bushing 2 Bushing 1Galvanometers Laser Nut Leadscrew part 1 Motor for recoatingmechanismLeft & right sliding contact jointsof recoater assemblyLeft & right sliding contactjoints of elevator assemblyRotating contact joints Rack for recoatingmechanism David Rosen & Brent Stucker Fig. 17.6 SLA-250 model built in an SLA-250 machine with 11 embedded components408 17 Design for Additive Manufacturingfabricate kinematic joints is coupled with embedded inserts since functional mechanisms can be fabricated entirely within the VP vat, greatly simplifying theprototyping process. Functional complexity can also be achieved by unique combination of AM technologies to produce, for instance, 3D integrated electronics. Researchers inthe W.M. Keck Center for 3D Innovation at the University of Texas at El Paso havedemonstrated the ability to produce a number of working devices by novel combinations of VP or ME and DW. Figure 17.7 illustrates the process plan for fabrication of a magnetic ﬂux sensor using VP and a nozzle-based DW process.Researchers have demonstrated similar capabilities with ME, sheet lamination,PBF, and other technologies as well. 17.3.4 Material Complexity Since material is processed point to point in many of the AM technologies, theopportunity is available to process the material differently at different points, asillustrated above, causing different material properties in different regions of the part. In addition, many AM technologies enable changing material composition gradually or abruptly during the build process. New applications will emerge totake advantage of these characteristics. The concept of functionally graded materials, or heterogeneous materials, has received considerable attention [ 11], but manufacturing useful parts from these materials often has been problematic. Consider a turbine blade for a jet engine. The Fig. 17.7 Fabrication of a magnetic ﬂux sensor using VP and DW (courtesy of W.M. Keck Center for 3D Innovation at The University of Texas at El Paso)17.3 AM Unique Capabilities 409outside of the blade must be resistant to high temperatures and be very stiff to prevent the blade from elongating signiﬁcantly during operation. The blade rootmust be ductile and have high fatigue life. Blade interiors must have high heat conductivity so that blades can be cooled. This is an example of a part with complex shape that requires different material properties in different regions. No singlematerial is ideal for this range of properties. Hence, if it was possible to fabricatecomplex parts with varying material composition and properties, turbine blades andsimilar parts could beneﬁt tremendously. DED processes, such as LENS and DMD machines, have demonstrated capabil- ity for fabricating graded material compositions. Ongoing work in this direction ispromising. Graded and multimaterial compositions are used in the repair of dam- aged or worn components using DED machines, and the design and fabrication of new components is being explored around the world. One such application forimproved components that is receiving considerable attention is the fabrication ofhigher-performance orthopedic implants. In this case, certain regions of the implantrequire excellent bone adhesion, whereas in other regions the bearing surfaces mustbe optimized to minimize the implant’s wear properties. Thus, by changing thecomposition of the material from the bone in-growth region to the bearing surface,the overall performance of the implant can be improved. As described in Chap. 7, Objet Geometries Ltd. (now Stratasys) introduced in 2007 the ﬁrst commercial AM machine, their Connex500 ™system, capable of ink-jet deposition of several polymer materials in one build. Their technology,called PolyJet Matrix ™, is an evolution of their printing technology. Recall that Objet uses large arrays of printing nozzles (up to 3,000) to quickly print parts usingphotopolymer materials. More recently, both Stratasys and 3D Systems haveintroduced full color printing technology using ink-jet printing of photopolymersthat exhibit a much wider range of mechanical properties than Objet’s original materials. For many years, ME machines have been shipped with multiple nozzles for multimaterial deposition. Although one or more nozzles is typically utilized forsupport materials and the other for build materials, many researchers and industrialpractitioners have utilized different feedstock materials in two banks of nozzles tocreate multimaterial constructs. As can easily be imagined, it would be quite easy,conceptually, to add more nozzles, and thus easily increase the number of materialswhich can be deposited in a single build. In fact, this concept has been utilized by a number of researchers in their own custom-built extrusion-based machines, primar- ily by those investigating extrusion-based processes for biomedical materialsresearch. A signiﬁcant issue hindering the adoption of AM’s material complexity is the lack of design and CAD tools that enable representation and reasoning withmultiple materials. This will be explored more completely in Sect. 17.6.410 17 Design for Additive Manufacturing17.4 Core DFAM Concepts and Objectives Given these unique capabilities of AM, we can articulate some core DFAM concepts and objectives. In contrast to DFM, we believe the objective of DFAMshould be to: Maximize product performance through the synthesis of shapes, sizes, hierar- chical structures, and material compositions, subject to the capabilities of AMtechnologies. To realize this objective, designers should keep in mind several guidelines when designing products: AM enables the usage of complex geometry in achieving design goals without incurring time or cost penalties compared with simple geometry. As a corollary to the ﬁrst guideline, it is often possible to consolidate parts, integrating features into more complex parts and avoiding assembly issues. AM enables the usage of customized geometry and parts by direct production from 3D data. With the emergence of commercial multimaterial AM machines, designers should explore multifunctional part designs that combine geometric and materialcomplexity capabilities. AM allows designers to ignore all of the constraints imposed by conventional manufacturing processes (although AM-speciﬁc constraints might be imposed). 17.4.1 Complex Geometry As was discussed earlier, AM processes are capable of fabricating parts with complex geometry. The layer-by-layer fabrication approach means that the shapes of part cross sections can be arbitrarily complex, up to the resolution of the process. For example, VP and PBF processes can fabricate features almost as thin as theirlaser spot sizes. In material jetting processes, features in the layer can be the size ofseveral printed droplets. In the Z direction (build direction), the discussion offeature complexity becomes more complicated. In principle, features can be asthin as a layer thickness; however, in practice, features typically are several layersthick. Stresses during the build, such as produced by recoating in VP, can limit Zresolution. Also, overcure or “bonus Z” effects occur in laser-based processes and tend to create regions that are thicker than a single layer. The need to remove the support structures necessary for some AM processes may also limit geometriccomplexity and/or feature size. Each AM process has its individual characteristicsand will take some time to learn. But in general the geometric complexity of AMprocesses far exceeds that of conventional manufacturing processes.17.4 Core DFAM Concepts and Objectives 41117.4.2 Integrated Assemblies The capability for complex geometry enables other practices. As was demonstrated at the end of Sect. 17.2, several parts can be replaced with a single, more complex part in many cases. Even when two or more components must be able to move with respect to one another, such as in a ball-and-socket joint, AM can build thesecomponents fully assembled. These capabilities enable the integration of featuresfrom multiple parts, possibly yielding better performance. Additionally, a reductionin the number of assembly operations can have a tremendous impact on productioncosts and difﬁculties for products. As is evident from conventional DFM practices, design changes to facilitate or eliminate assembly operations can lead to much larger reductions in production costs than changes to facilitate part manufacture [ 3]. This is true, at least in part, due to the elimination of any assembly tooling that may have been required. Althoughconventional DFM guidelines for part manufacturing are not relevant to AM, thedesign-for-assembly guidelines remain relevant and perhaps even more important.Other advantages exist for the consolidation of parts. For example, a reduction inpart count reduces product complexity from management and productionperspectives. Fewer parts need to be tracked, sourced, inspected, etc. The needfor spare or replacement parts decreases. Furthermore, the need to warehouse tooling to fabricate the parts can be eliminated. In summary, part consolidation can lead to signiﬁcant savings across the entire enterprise. 17.4.3 Customized Geometry Consistent with the capability of complex geometry, AM processes can fabricatecustom geometries. This has been demonstrated by a series of examples throughoutthis book related to direct digital manufacturing and biomedical applications. Agood example is that of hearing aid shells (Sect. 16.2). Each shell must be customized for an individual’s particular ear canal geometry. In VP or PBFmachines, hundreds or thousands of shells, each of a different geometry, can bebuilt at the same time in a single machine. Mass customization, instead of mass production, can be realized quite readily. The lack of generic software tools for mass customization, rather than limitations of the hardware, is the key limitationwhen considering AM for mass customization. 17.4.4 Multifunctional Designs Multifunctionality is simply the achievement of multiple functions, or purposes,with a single part. This is commonly achieved when performing part consolidation,but the capability of material complexity enables much more ambitiousexplorations of design possibilities. For example, if a part needs to be stiff in onelocation, but ﬂexible in another, several AM processes could be used to fabricate412 17 Design for Additive Manufacturingsuch a design simply by varying material composition. Another example is a heat exchanger, that also serves a structural purpose, which could be fabricated bygrading steel and copper alloys. By combining geometric and material complexity, very high performance devices can be fabricated. In many cases, designers will need to develop new design concepts and then explore them, since many domainswill lack examples of previously successful designs. 17.4.5 Elimination of Conventional DFM Constraints Since the 1980s, engineering design has changed considerably due to the impact ofDFM, concurrent engineering, and integrated product-process teaming practices. Asigniﬁcant amount of time and funds were dedicated to learning about thecapabilities and constraints imposed by other parts of the organization. As shouldbe clear from this chapter, AM processes have the potential to reduce the burden onorganizations to have integrated product development teams that spend largeamounts of time resolving constraints and conﬂicts. With AM, designers have tolearn far fewer manufacturing constraints. The embrace of DFM has resulted in a design culture where the design space is limited from the earliest conceptual design stage to those designs that are manufacturable using conventional techniques. WithAM, these design constraints are no longer valid, and the designer can have muchgreater design freedom. As such, the challenge in DFAM is not so much the understanding of the effects of manufacturing constraints. Rather it is the difﬁculty in exploring new designspaces, in innovating new product structures, and in thinking about products inunconventional ways. These do not have to be difﬁculties, since they are really opportunities. However, the engineering community must be open to the possibilities and learn to exercise their collective creativity. 17.5 Exploring Design Freedoms With the unique capabilities of AM identiﬁed, we can illustrate how to utilize thosecapabilities through a set of examples. In one approach, companies have achieved signiﬁcant part consolidation, combining several parts into a single part. In a second approach, researchers have demonstrated how hierarchical structures can resultfrom structuring the material in parts using mesoscale or microscale features toproduce the so-called cellular materials. In the third approach, industrial designershave explored new design concepts for some everyday products, such as plates,chairs, and clothing.17.5 Exploring Design Freedoms 41317.5.1 Part Consolidation and Redesign The characteristics of geometric complexity and suitability for low-volume produc- tion combine to yield substantial beneﬁts in many cases for consolidating parts intoa smaller number of more complex parts that are then fabricated using an AM process. This has several signiﬁcant advantages over designs with multiple parts. First, dedicated tooling for multiple parts is not required. Potential assemblydifﬁculties are avoided. Assembly tooling, such as ﬁxtures, is not needed. Fastenerscan often be eliminated. Finally, it is often possible to design the consolidated partsto perform better than the assemblies. A well-known example that illustrates these advantages was shown in Fig. 17.2, that of a prototypical duct for military aircraft [ 6,7]. The design shows a typical traditional design with many formed and rotomolded plastic parts, some formed sheet-metal parts, and fasteners [ 12]. The example was from the pioneering work of the Boeing Phantom Works Advanced Direct Digital Manufacturing group inretroﬁtting F-18 ﬁghter jets with dozens of parts produced using PBF. Many ofthese parts replaced standard ducting components to deliver cooling air to electron-ics modules. Signiﬁcant part reductions, elimination of fasteners, and optimizationof shapes are illustrative of the advances made by Boeing. Through these methods,many part manufacturing tools and assembly operations were eliminated. A second example, from Loughborough University, illustrates the advantages of reconceptualizing the design of a component based on the ability to avoid limitations of conventional manufacturing processes. Figure 17.8 shows a front plate design for a diesel engine [ 7]. The channels through which fuel or oil ﬂow are gun drilled. As a result, they are straight; furthermore, plugs need to be added toplug up the holes through the housing that enabled the channels to be drilled. Theredesign shown in Fig. 17.8b was developed by designing the ﬂow channels to ensure efﬁcient ﬂows, then adding a minimal amount of additional material toprovide structural integrity. As a result, the part is smaller, lighter, and has better performance than the original design. Fig. 17.8 Diesel front plate example. ( a) Original design. ( b) Redesigned for additive manufacturing414 17 Design for Additive Manufacturing17.5.2 Hierarchical Structures The basic idea of hierarchical structures is that features at one size scale can have smaller features added to them, and each of those smaller features can have smaller features added, etc. Tailored nano/microstructures are one example. Textures added to surfaces of parts are another example. In addition, cellular materials (materialswith voids), including foams, honeycombs, and lattice structures, are a thirdexample of hierarchical feature. To illustrate the beneﬁts of designing with hierar-chical ﬂexibility, we will focus on cellular materials in this section. The concept of designed cellular materials is motivated by the desire to put material only where it is needed for a speciﬁc application. From a mechanicalengineering viewpoint, a key advantage offered by cellular materials is high strength accompanied by a relatively low mass. These materials can provide good energy absorption characteristics and good thermal and acoustic insulationproperties as well [ 13]. When the characteristic lengths of the cells are in the range of 0.1–10 mm, we refer to these materials as mesostructured materials.Mesostructured materials that are not produced using stochastic processes (e.g.,foaming) are called designed cellular materials. In the past 15 years, the area of lattice materials has received considerable attention due to their inherent advantages over foams in providing light, stiff, and strong materials [ 14]. Lattice structures tend to have geometry variations in three dimensions; as is illustrated in Fig. 17.9. As pointed out in [ 15], the strength of foams scales as ρ 1.5, whereas lattice structure strength scales as ρ, where ρis the volumetric density of the material. As a result, lattices with a ρ¼0.1 are about three times stronger per unit weight than a typical foam. The strength differences lie inthe nature of material deformation: the foam is governed by cell wall bending,while lattice elements stretch and compress. The examples shown in Fig. 17.9 utilize the octet-truss (shown on the left), but many other lattice structures have been developed and studied (e.g., kagome, Kelvin foam) [ 16,17]. cylinder with 2 layers of truss structure made in SL1 1 10.5 0.5 0.5 octet-trussuvdabc w0 0 0 skin with single layer of lattice structure Fig. 17.9 Octet-truss unit cell and example parts with octet-truss mesostructures17.5 Exploring Design Freedoms 415The parts shown in Fig. 17.9b, c illustrate one method of developing stiff, lightweight structures, that of using a thin part wall, or skin, and stiffening it with cellular structure. Another method could involve ﬁlling a volume with the cellularstructures. Using either approach often results in part designs with thousands ofshape elements (beams, struts, walls, etc.). Most commercial CAD systems cannotperform geometric modeling operations on designs with more than 1,000–2,000elements. As a result, the design in Fig. 17.9c , which has almost 18,000 shape elements, cannot be modeled using conventional CAD software. Instead, new CADtechnologies must be developed that are capable of modeling such complex geometries [ 18]; this is the subject of Sect. 17.6. Several groups designed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) components by applying various cellular structure design approaches. Figure 17.10 shows a hand- held UAV, the Streetﬂyer from AVID LLC, that was redesigned to utilize latticestructure reinforcement. The original design of the UAV utilized carbon ﬁber skins Fig. 17.10 Lattice structure-based UAV design. ( a) lattice structure designs for fuselage and wings. ( b) assembled UAV ready for test ﬂight416 17 Design for Additive Manufacturingfor the fuselage and wings, but required many assembly operations to add stiffeners, fastening features, and mounting features to the components. In contrast, bydesigning for AM, the lattice structure-based design had such features and stiffeners designed in. Experts at Paramount Industries, a 3D Systems company, fabricated the fuselage and wings in Duraform using PBF. Test ﬂights demonstrated that thePBF-fabricated UAV performed well and, even though the UAV was notoptimized, its performance approached that of the carbon ﬁber production version. 17.5.3 Industrial Design Applications Some very intriguing approaches to product design have been demonstrated thattake advantage of the shape complexity capabilities of AM, as well as somematerial characteristics. A leader in this ﬁeld was a small company in TheNetherlands called Freedom of Creation (FOC), founded by Janne Kytannen,which was purchased by 3D Systems in the early 2010s. See: http://www. freedomofcreation.com . FOC began operations in the late 1990s. Their ﬁrst commercial products were lamp shades fabricated in VP and PBF [ 20], an example of which is shown in Fig.17.11a . They have since developed many families of lampshade designs. In 2003, they partnered with Materialise to market lampshades, which retail for 300 to6,000 euros (as of 2009). Many other classes of products have been developed, including chairs and stools, handbags, bowls, trays, and other specialty items. See Fig. 17.11b, c for examples of other products. Also, they have partnered with large and smallorganizations to develop special “give-aways” for major occasions, many of which were designed to be manufactured via AM. In the early 2000s, they developed the concept of manufacturing textiles. Their early designs were of chain-mail construction, manufactured in PBF. Since then,they have developed several lines of products using similar concepts, includinghandbags, other types of bags, and even shower scrubs. More recently, quite a few other companies have demonstrated very innovative designs of housewares, clothing, fashion accessories, and even shoes. Fashionshows have focused on AM-fabricated clothes, parts of clothing, and accessories. Some examples from 2014 include Anouk Wipprecht’s electriﬁed 3D printed dresses, hats/headpieces by Gabriela Ligenza, Ray Civello, and Stephen Ma, anddresses and accessories from Iris Van Herpen. Another source of inspiration comes from browsing the virtual storefronts on shapeways.com and ponoko.com, where individual entrepreneurs and smallcompanies can offer custom designs. Everything from jewelry to candle holdersto bird houses can be found on these sites. Methods of manufacturing the designsoffered on each storefront need to be provided and many times the only methods are through AM. Some sites provide design guidelines, suggestions, or even specially developed CAD tools.17.5 Exploring Design Freedoms 41717.6 CAD Tools for AM With tremendous design potential waiting for designers to explore, they need good tools to support their exploration. In this section, we present challenges and technologies associated with mechanical CAD systems. 17.6.1 Challenges for CAD Current solid-modeling-based CAD systems have several limitations that make them less than ideal for taking advantage of the unique capabilities of AMmachines. For some applications, CAD is a bottleneck in creating novel shapesand structures, in describing desired part properties, and in specifying materialcompositions. These representational problems imply difﬁculties in driving process Fig. 17.11 Example products from Freedom of Creation: ( a) a wall-mounted lampshade, Dahlia light, designed by Janne Kyttanen for Freedom Of Creation, ( b) stacking footstools, Monarch Stools, designed by Janne Kyttanen for Freedom Of Creation, and ( c) a handbag, Punch Bag, designed by Jiri Evenhuis and Janne Kyttanen for Freedom Of Creation418 17 Design for Additive Manufacturingplanning and other analysis activities. Potentially, this issue will slow the adoption of AM technologies for use in production manufacture. More speciﬁcally, the challenges for CAD can be stated as: Geometric complexity—need to support models with tens and hundreds of thousands of features. Physically based material representations—material compositions and distributions must be represented and must be physically meaningful. Physically based property representations—desired distributions of physical and mechanical properties must be represented and tested for their physical basis. One example of the geometric complexity issue is illustrated by the prototype textile application, from Loughborough University and Freedom of Creation,shown in Fig. 17.12 [21]. On the left is a “chain mail”-like conﬁguration of many small rings. On the right is an example garment fabricated on a PBF machine in aDuraform material. The researchers desired to fold up the CAD model of thegarment so that it occupied a very small region in the machine’s build platform, which would maximize the throughput of the PBF machine for production purposes. The Loughborough researchers had great difﬁculty modeling the collec-tion of thousands of rings that comprise the garment in a commercial solid-modeling CAD system. Instead they developed their own CAD system for textileand similar structured surface applications over several years. However, having todevelop custom CAD systems for speciﬁc applications will be a signiﬁcant barrierto widespread adoption of AM. Two CAD challenges can be illustrated by some simple examples. The Stratasys Connex 500 material jetting machine can deposit several different materials while building one part. To drive the machine, Stratasys needed to develop a new Fig. 17.12 Example of textiles produced using PBF17.6 CAD Tools for AM 419software tool that allows users to specify materials in different regions of STL ﬁles. It would be far better to be able to specify material composition in the original CADsystem, so that vendor or machine-speciﬁc tools are not needed. The second example was a research project from the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing and Advanced Materials (IFAM) in Bremen, Germany [ 22]. They developed a two-binder system for 3D Printing technology, where one binder is traditional andone is carbon laden. Their goal was to produce gradient strength steel parts bydepositing the carbon according to a desired distribution of hardness. The model ofhardness will be converted into a representation of carbon distribution, which willbe converted into carbon-laden binder deposition commands for the 3DP system.After building, the part will be heat treated to diffuse the carbon into the steel. As a result, this application illustrates the need to represent distributions of mechanical properties (hardness) and material composition (carbon, steel), and relate these toprocessing conditions. The IFAM researchers developed a software system for thisapplication. 17.6.2 Solid-Modeling CAD Systems Parametric, solid-modeling CAD systems are used throughout much of the worldfor mechanical product development and are used in university education andresearch. Such systems, such as ProEngineer, Unigraphics, SolidEdge, CATIA,and SolidWorks, are very good for representing shapes of most engineered parts. Their feature-based modeling approaches enable fast design of parts with many types of typical shape elements. Assembly modeling capabilities provide means forautomatically positioning parts within assemblies and for enforcing assemblyrelationships when part sizes are changed. Commercial CAD systems typically have a hybrid CSG-BRep (constructive solid geometry—boundary representation) internal representation of part geometryand topology. With the CSG part of the representation, part construction history ismaintained as a sequence of feature creation, operation, and modiﬁcation processes. With the BRep part of the representation, part surfaces are represented directly and exactly. Adjacencies among all points, curves, surfaces, and solids are maintained.A tremendous amount of information is represented, all of which has its purposesfor providing design interactions, fast graphics, mass properties, and interfaces toother CAD/CAM/CAE tools. For parts with dozens or hundreds of surfaces, commercial CAD systems run with interactive speeds, for most types of design operations, on typical personalcomputers. When more than 1,000 surfaces or parts are modeled, the CAD systems tend to run very slowly and use hundreds of MB or several GB of memory. For the textile part, Fig. 17.12 , thousands of rings comprise the garment. However, they have the same simple shape, that of a torus. A different type of application is that ofhierarchical structures, where feature sizes span several orders of magnitude. Anexample is that of a multimaterial mold with conformal cooling channels, where thecooling channels have small ﬁns or other protrusions to enhance heat transfer. The420 17 Design for Additive Manufacturingﬁns or protrusions may have sizes of 0.01 mm, while the channels may be 10 mm in diameter, and the mold may be 400 mm long. The central region of the mold mayuse a high conductivity, high toughness material composition, whereas the surface of the mold may have a high hardness material composition, where a conformal, gradient transition occurs within a region near the surface of the mold. As a result,the mold model may have many thousands of small features and must also representa gradient material composition that is derived from knowledge of the geometricfeatures. In addition, the range of size scales may cause problems in managinginternal tolerances in the CAD system. Current CAD systems are incapable ofrepresenting the thousands of features or the graded material composition o f thismold example. In summary, two main geometry-related capabilities are needed to support many emerging design applications, particularly when AM manufacturing processes willbe utilized: Representation of tens or hundreds of thousands of features, surfaces, and parts. Managing features, materials, surfaces, and parts across size ranges of 4–6 orders of magnitude. The ISO STEP standard provides a data exchange representation for solid geometry, material composition, and some other properties. However, it is intendedfor exchanging product information among CAD, CAM, and CAE systems, not forproduct development and manufacturing purposes. That is, the STEP representationwas not developed for use within modeling and processing applications. A goodassessment of its usefulness in representing parts with heterogeneous materials forAM manufacturing is given in reference [ 11], although at present the standards community is revisiting the potential usage of STEP for AM. As mentioned above, the ﬁrst challenge for CAD systems is geometric complex- ity. The second challenge for CAD systems is to directly represent materials, tospecify a part’s material composition. As a result, CAD models cannot be used torepresent parts with multiple materials or composite materials. Material composi-tion representations are needed for parts with graded interfaces, functionally gradedmaterials, and even simpler cases of particle or ﬁber ﬁller materials. Furthermore,CAD models can only provide geometric information for other applications, such asmanufacturing or analysis, not complex multiple material information, which limits their usefulness. This type of limitation is clear when one considers the ink-jet printing examples mentioned so far (e.g., Stratasys multimaterial printer, IFAMcarbon-laden inks). In the IFAM case, the addition of carbon to steel deals with therelatively well understood area of carbon steels. In other applications, novelmaterial combinations that are less understood may be of interest. Two main issuesarise, including the need to: Represent desired material compositions at appropriate size scales. Determine the extent to which desired material compositions are achievable.17.6 CAD Tools for AM 421Without a high ﬁdelity representation of materials, it will not be possible to directly fabricate parts using emerging AM processes. Furthermore, DFM practiceswill be difﬁcult to support. Together, these limitations may prevent the adoption of AM processes for applications where fast response to orders is needed. The third challenge, that of representing physically based property distributions, is perhaps the most challenging. The IFAM example of relating desired hardness tocarbon content is a relatively simple case. More generally, the geometry, materials,processing, and property information for a design must be represented andintegrated. Without such integrated CAD models, it will be very difﬁcult to designparts with desired properties. Analysis and manufacturing applications will not beenabled. The capability of utilizing AM processes to their fullest extent will not be realized. In summary, two main issues are evident: Process–structure–property relationships for materials must be integrated into geometric representations of CAD models. CAD system capabilities must be developed that enable designers to synthesize a part, its material composition, and its manufacturing methods to meetspeciﬁcations. 17.6.3 Promising CAD Technologies The challenges raised in the previous subsection are difﬁcult and go against thedirections of decades of CAD research and development. Some CAD technologies on the horizon, however, have promise in meeting these challenges. Two broad categories of technologies will be presented here, implicit modeling and multiscalemodeling. Additional technologies can be combined to yield a CAD system that canbe used to design components for a wide variety of purposes and with a wide varietyof material compositions and geometric complexities. 17.6.3.1 Proposed DFAM System Figure 17.13 shows one proposed DFAM system [ 19]. To the right in the ﬁgure, the designer can construct a DFAM synthesis problem, using an existing problemtemplate if desired. For different problem types, different solution methods andalgorithms will be available. Analysis codes, including FEA, boundary element,and specialty codes, will be integrated to determine design behavior. In the middle,the heterogeneous solid modeler (HSM) is illustrated that consists of implicit and multiscale modeling technologies. Heterogeneous solid modeling denotes that material and other property information will be modeled along with geometry.Libraries of materials and mesostructures enable rapid construction of designmodels. To the left, the manufacturing modules are shown. Both process planningand simulation modules are important in this system. After planning amanufacturing process, the idea is that the process will be simulated on the currentdesign to determine the as-manufactured shapes, sizes, mesostructures, and422 17 Design for Additive Manufacturingmicrostructures. The as-manufactured model will then be analyzed to determine whether or not it actually meets design objectives. The proposed geometric representation is a combination of implicit, nonmanifold, and parametric modeling, with the capability of generating BRepwhen needed. Implicit modeling is used to represent overall part geometry, whilenonmanifold modeling is used to represent shape skeletons. Parametric modeling isnecessary when decomposing the overall part geometry into cellular structures;each cell type will be represented as a parametric model. 17.6.3.2 Implicit Modeling Implicit modeling has many advantages over conventional BRep, CSG, cellulardecomposition, and hybrid approaches, including its conciseness, ability to modelwith any analytic surface models, and its avoidance of complex geometric andtopological representations [ 23]. The primary disadvantage is that an explicit boundary representation is not maintained, making visualization and otherevaluations more difﬁcult than with some representation types. For HSM, addi-tional advantages are apparent. Implicit modeling offers a uniﬁed approach for representing geometry, materials, and distributions of any physical quantity. A common solution method can be used to solve for material compositions, analysisresults (e.g., deﬂections, stresses, temperatures), and for spatial decompositions ifthey can be modeled as boundary value problems [ 24]. Furthermore, it provides a method for decomposing geometry and other properties to arbitrary resolutionswhich is useful for generating visualizations and manufacturing process plans. In conventional CAD systems, parametric curves and surfaces are the primary geometric entities used in modeling typical engineered parts. For example, cubic curves are prevalent in geometric modeling; a typical 2D curve would be given by parametric equations such asImplicit Solid Modeler Materials, Microstructure, MesostructureManufacturing Process Planner Manufacturing SimulatorDFAM Solution Methods Analysis Codes Materials Mfg Processes MesostructuresDFAM TemplatesProcessPlanning Determine as-manufactured shapes, properties1 32 4 Fig. 17.13 DFAM system and overall structure17.6 CAD Tools for AM 423xuðÞ ¼ au3þbu2þcuþd yuðÞ ¼ eu3þfu2þguþhð17:1Þ These equations would have been simpliﬁed from their formulation as Bezier, b-spline, or NURBS (nonuniform, rational b-splines) curves [ 25]. In contrast, implicit functions are functions that are set equal to zero. Often, it is not possibleto solve for one or more of the variables explicitly through algebraic manipulation. Rather, numerical methods must often be used to solve implicit equations. Fre- quently, sampling is used to visualize implicit functions or to solve them. Morespeciﬁcally, the general form of an implicit equation of three variables (assumed tobe Cartesian coordinates) is presented along with the equation for a circle inimplicit form: zx ;yðÞ ¼ 0 zx ;yðÞ ¼ 1 2rx/C0xc ðÞ2þy/C0yc ðÞ2/C0r2hið17:2Þ where xc,ycare the xandycoordinates of the circle center and ris its radius. Shapiro and coworkers have advanced the application of the theory of R-functions to show how engineering analyses [ 24] and material composition [26] can be performed using implicit modeling approaches. The advantage of their approach is the unifying nature of implicit modeling to model geometry,material composition, and distributions of any physically meaningful quantitythroughout a part. Furthermore, from these models of property distributions, theycan perform analyses using methods akin to the Boundary Element Method (BEM). As an example, consider the 2D rectangular part shown in Fig. 17.14 with rectangular and circular holes. The implicit equations that model the boundaries of the part are presented in ( 17.3a –17.3d ). Equations ( 17.3a and17.3b ) models the x-extents and y-extents of the part, while ( 17.3c ) and ( 17.3d ) models the rectangular hole and ( 17.3e ) models the circular hole ( r¼0.6, x c¼yc¼0.1). Note that the equation for each boundary feature is 0-valued at the boundary, is positive in thepart interior, and is negative in the part exterior. These equations were formulatedusing R-functions [ 26]. w 1xðÞ ¼4/C0x2 4ð17:3aÞ w2yðÞ ¼8þ2y/C0y2 9ð17:3bÞ w3xðÞ ¼ x2/C00:25 ð17:3cÞ w4yðÞ ¼ 2y/C03ðÞ2/C00:125 ð17:3dÞ424 17 Design for Additive Manufacturingw5x;yðÞ ¼1 2r2x/C0xc ðÞ2þy/C0yc ðÞ2/C0r2hi ð17:3eÞ An equation for the entire part can be developed by combining the boundary functions using operators ^and∨which, in the simplest case, are functions “min” and “max,” respectively; other more sophisticated expressions can be used. The part equation is W¼w1^w2^w3∨w4 ðÞ ^ w5 ð17:4Þ with the interpretation that the part is deﬁned as Ωwhen Wis greater than or equal to 0,Ω¼(W(x,y)/C210) A plot of the part function is shown in Fig. 17.15 , which shows contours of constant function value ( 17.4). Generalizing from the example, it is always the case that a single algebraic equation can be derived to represent a part using implicitgeometry, regardless of the part complexity. Additional, more sophisticated techniques can be applied to generate useful parameterizations of part models for modeling multiple materials or for applications in design, analysis, or manufacturing, but they will not be explored further here. Fig. 17.14 Example part to illustrate implicit modeling17.6 CAD Tools for AM 42517.7 Synthesis Methods The capabilities of AM processes have inspired many people to try to design structures so that they have minimum weight, without regard to geometric com-plexity. Quite a few researchers are investigating methods for synthesizing lightweight structures, with the intention of fabricating the resulting structures usingAM. The work has been extended in some cases to the design of compliantmechanisms, that is, one-piece structures that move. In this section, we provide a brief survey of some recent research in this area. A brief exploration of optimization methods will be covered, with an emphasis on the emerging area of topologyoptimization that promises to aid designers in efﬁciently exploring novel structures. 17.7.1 Theoretically Optimal Lightweight Structures Several years ago, researchers rediscovered the pioneering work of AGM Michell in the early 1900s who developed the mathematical conditions under which struc- ture weight becomes minimized [ 27]. He proved that structures can have minimum weight if their members are purely tension-compression members (i.e., are trusses)and derived the rules for truss layout. A typical Michell truss is shown in Fig. 17.16 for a common loaded plate structural problem. Note that the solution has a “wagonwheel” structure. Fig. 17.15 Contours of implicit part equation426 17 Design for Additive ManufacturingIn general, it is difﬁcult to compute optimal Michell truss layouts for any but the simplest 2D cases. Some researchers have developed numerical procedures forcomputing approximate solutions. At least one research group has proposed tofabricate Michell trusses using AM processes and has investigated multiple mate-rial solution cases [ 28]. For proposed synthesis algorithms for large complex problems, Michell trusses provide an excellent baseline against which solutions for more complicated problems can be compared. 17.7.2 Optimization Methods In our context, optimization methods seek to improve the design of an artifact by adjusting values of design variables in order to achieve desired objectives, typically related to structural performance or weight, as well as possible without violating constraints. A variety of optimization problem formulations has been developedthat vary based on type of objectives and scope of the problem. Good textbooks [ 29] and many research papers have been written on the subject. The three main types ofoptimization problems that have been explored for design for AM include, in orderof increasing complexity and scope: Size optimization—where values of dimensions are determined Shape optimization—where shapes of part surfaces are changed Topology optimization—where distributions of material are explored In size optimization, the values of selected dimensions are determined that best achieve the objectives while satisfying any constraints. For typical structuraloptimization applications, objectives could include the minimization of maximumstress, strain energy, deﬂection, or part volume or weight. One or more of thesequantities may also be modeled as constraints. For many mechanical parts, a small number of size dimensions will be part of the optimization problem. However, for cellular structures, such as lattices, the number of design variables could number inthe tens or hundreds of thousands. Fig. 17.16 Michell truss layout ( b) for simple loaded plate example ( a)17.7 Synthesis Methods 427Shape optimization is a generalization of size optimization. Typically the shape of bounding curves or surfaces is optimized to achieve similar objectives andconstraints. As such, the positions of control vertices for curves or surfaces are often used as the design variables. Shape and size optimization are frequently combined in order to optimize structures that have free-form shapes, as well asstandard shapes (e.g., cylinders) with dimensions. In topology optimization, the overall shape, arrangement of shape elements, and connectivity of the design domain are determined. Again, part volume or compli-ance is minimized, subject to constraints on, for example, volume, compliance,stress, strain energy, and possibly additional considerations. The primarydifferences between topology optimization and shape or size optimization are in the starting geometric conﬁguration and the choice of variables, which can lead to very signiﬁcant improvements in structural performance. The recent interest intopology optimization as a design method for AM warrants a closer look into thistechnology. 17.7.3 Topology Optimization Topology optimization (TO) methods determine the overall conﬁguration of shapeelements in a design problem. Often, TO results are used as inputs to subsequent size or shape optimization problems. As structural optimization methods, ﬁnite element analyses are performed typically during each iteration of the optimizationmethod, which means that TO can be computationally demanding. Furthermore,TO solutions should result in structures that are nearly fully stressed, or haveconstant strain energy, throughout the structure geometry based on the speciﬁedloading conditions. Two main approaches have been developed for TO problems:truss-based and volume-based density methods. 17.7.3.1 Truss-Based Methods In the truss-based approach, a mesh of struts among a set of nodes is deﬁned in a volume of interest, where sometimes the mesh represents a complete graph (e.g., ground truss) and sometimes it is based on unit cells. Topology optimizationproceeds to identify which struts are most important for the problem, determinetheir size (e.g., diameter), and remove struts with small sizes. Result quality is oftena strong function of the starting mesh of struts. Results will resemble the latticestructures presented earlier, with variations in strut diameters evident. In the ﬁrst variations of truss-based methods, a ground truss was deﬁned over a grid of nodes, with each node connected to every other node by a truss element. Each element’s diameter was used as the design variable. As optimization proceeds, those elements whose diameters become small are deleted from the design.Although the methods worked well, they tended to be computationally expensive.Recently, more sophisticated methods have been developed that utilize a differentproblem formulation, involving background meshes and analytical derivatives forcomputation of sensitivities, for truss optimization methods [ 30]. Good results have428 17 Design for Additive Manufacturingbeen achieved when both truss element size and position are used as design variables. Variations of these approaches have demonstrated the capability ofachieving risk-based or reliability-related objectives [ 31]. Other synthesis methods utilize heuristic optimization methods in an attempt to greatly reduce the number of design variables in the optimization problem. Forexample, the Size Matching and Scaling (SMS) method starts with a conformallattice structure (Sect. 17.5.2 ) but only requires two design variables, the minimum and maximum strut diameters, to optimize the structure [ 18]. The method works by performing a ﬁnite element analysis (FEA) on a solid body of the design. A conformal lattice structure is constructed that ﬁts within the solid body. Local strainor stress values from the FEA results are used to scale struts in the lattice structureresulting in a set of relative strut size values. Size optimization is performed on thelattice structure to determine the values of the minimum and maximum strutdiameters, using frame elements to model the lattice structure. Application of theSMS method to a simpliﬁed UAV fuselage design problem is illustrated inFig.17.17 . Note that regions of high stress result in thick struts. 17.7.3.2 Volume-Based Density Methods The second main approach is based on determining the appropriate material density in a set of voxels that comprise a spatial domain. The density-based TO method thatis most common, and is used in the commercial software packages, is known as theSIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) method. The starting geometryfor the problem is a rectilinear block that is composed of a set of voxels. Each voxel has a density value which is used as its design variable. A density value of 1 indicates that the material is fully dense, while a value of 0 indicates that nomaterial is present. Intermediate values indicate that the material need not be fullysolid to support the local stress state in that voxel. Solutions are preferred that havevoxels that are either fully dense or near 0 density, since typically partially densematerials are difﬁcult to manufacture. Density values are used to scale voxelstiffness values in the FEA models that are used during the TO process. The typical topology optimization problem is formulated as [ 32]: Side View Bottom Viewa b Fig. 17.17 SMS method results on UAV fuselage design problem17.7 Synthesis Methods 429min xLuðÞ ¼Z Ωf/C1vdxþZ Γt/C1vds ð17:5Þ such that au ;vðÞ ¼ LvðÞ, all v∈U ð17:6Þ where au ;vðÞ ¼Z ΩEijklεkluðÞεijvðÞdx ð17:7Þ xare points in the spatial domain of interest, Uare admissible displacement ﬁelds, f are body forces, tare surface tractions. Equation ( 17.7) is known as the energy bilinear form. The design variables in this formulation are the elasticity tensors Eijkl. In the SIMP method, the elasticity tensors are functions of density and sometimes orientation. A typical example of topology optimization is shown in Fig. 17.18 , which is a simple cantilever plate with a downward point load on its right side. Topology optimization algorithms can maintain the connectivity of material around the loading and boundary areas, and also ensure that these areas are connected. They can add an arbitrary number of holes or strut regions to the design domain. However, they often produce rough or undesirable part shapes. Although the design in Fig. 17.18 could be fabricated using AM, one would probably prefer smoother shapes and transitions between major shape elements. The example was computed using the popular 99-line TO Matlab code from Ole Sigmund [ 33], with inputs of 80/C250 units in size, a volume fraction of 0.5, a penalization exponent of 3, and the rmin (ﬁlter size) term of 1.5. Two popular commercial codes for TO are OptiStruct from Altair and Abaqus, which is marketed by Dassault Systemes. Both packages can solve a variety of TO problems. For example, OptiStruct provides a fairly general topology optimization capability for problems where the structural and system behavior can be simulated by ﬁnite element and/or multi-body dynamics analyses. As a result, both composite Fig. 17.18 Simple topology optimization example430 17 Design for Additive Manufacturingshells (layout of laminated construction by modifying ply thickness and angle) and mechanisms can be optimized. Before describing each package in more detail, the general limitations of these commercial TO systems will be highlighted. First, topology optimization is based on approximate models of mechanics that can differ substantially from the actualpart or material mechanics. Furthermore, the simple mechanics models are inade-quate for cellular materials since their mechanics cannot be approximated by anisotropic solid. For example, assume that an element has a density of 30 % and thedesigner wants to use the octet truss construction in the region of that element.Placing an octet truss unit cell into the 30 % solid region will result in completelydifferent mechanical behavior than the behavior assumed during topology optimization. Second, the results of topology optimization are rarely manufacturable directly, even by AM. Typically, designs retain their meshed surfaces so that they arerougher (and tessellated) than would be desired. Part regions may become verythin between thick sections, introducing unwanted stress concentrations. Sometopology optimization systems do a better job of producing designs with smoothersurfaces (e.g., ABAQUS), but even so the user manuals typically recommend thattopology optimization results be used to guide part design—they provide concep- tual solutions—rather than be regarded as suitable for production usage. Further- more, the models produced by topology optimization are typically not suitable forimport back into a CAD system for reﬁnement since they will be facetted (originalCAD surfaces have been lost) and will not have any parameters associated withgeometric shapes. As such, it is very difﬁcult to modify or reﬁne topology optimi-zation models in CAD. Abaqus is part of the Simulia brand of CAE software marketed by Dassault Systemes. Abaqus is generally considered an excellent FEA package with state-of- the-art nonlinear and plasticity analysis capabilities. Multi-physics simulation is provided with integration between structural, thermal, ﬂuid ﬂow, and othermechanics models. Additionally, Abaqus has an extensive library of materialmodels that includes metals, polymers, rubbers, and even biological tissues. Awide array of physical properties is included, including standard mechanical,thermal, ﬂuidic, acoustic, and diffusion, as well as user-deﬁned materials. The Abaqus Topology Optimization Module (ATOM) offers topology and shape optimization capabilities that utilize much of the simulation power of Abaqus. Speciﬁcally, topology and shape optimization is offered for single parts and assemblies, while leveraging advanced simulation capabilities such as contact,material nonlinearity, and large deformation. The second commercial system to be discussed is from Altair, which offers their HyperWorks suite of CAE software that includes OptiStruct, their topology optimi-zation package. More generally, OptiStruct is marketed as a structural analysissolver for linear and nonlinear structural problems under static or dynamic loadings.Structures can be optimized for their strength, durability, NVH (noise-vibration- harshness), thermal, and some acoustics characteristics. Altair claims that OptiStruct can solve optimization problems with thousands of design variables17.7 Synthesis Methods 431and can combine topology, topography (e.g., vary thickness of a sheet), size, and shape optimization capabilities. Additionally, the composites models that can begenerated in HyperMesh can be optimized in OptiStruct. Further, OptiStruct canoptimize both ﬂexible and rigid bodies during multi-body dynamic analysis.Fatigue-based concept design and optimization is also provided. Also from Altair, solidThinking Inspire is a separate application that supports easy-to-use topology optimization capabilities. solidThinking is the name of the company that developed the software; they were acquired by Altair recently (2012–2013). From the company literature, Inspire does not seem to be integrated withHyperWorks or OptiStruct, but it should be only a matter of time before someintegration is achieved. As a second example, a more sophisticated 3D TO problem is shown in Fig. 17.19 , which represents a cargo sling design problem. The design domain, shown in the left, is 3 /C23/C26 m in size with a material thickness of 0.3 m (a quarter model was used to take advantage of symmetry). A pressure load of 3 kPa was applied as shown by the arrows. Symmetry boundary conditions were used. The TOsolution was computed in Abaqus for a volume constraint of 15 % of the initialvolume in the design region, as shown on the right. The example demonstrates thatreasonable solutions can be obtained using commercial TO systems in a reasonableamount of time (1 h on a standard PC). Fig. 17.19 3D cargo sling topology optimization example. Courtesy Mahmoud Alzahrani and Dr. Seung-Kyum Choi, Georgia Institute of Technology432 17 Design for Additive ManufacturingTO remains a very active topic of research. Some of the research issues and directions under investigation include ensuring connectivity of regions in theresulting structures [ 34], improving the efﬁciency of TO methods by introducing the concept of a topological sensitivity [ 35], and exploring alternative solution approaches such as level sets and evolutionary structural optimization. The level setapproach [ 36] models the distribution of material in a domain using an implicit function representation. The part boundaries are computed by ﬁnding the zero-levelcontour of this implicit function representation. Quite a lot of research is underwayto develop efﬁcient, robust level set solution algorithms, particularly for 3Dproblems. In contrast, evolutionary structural optimization methods [ 34] utilize stochastic, evolutionary optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization, but with a problem formulation that is similar to SIMP. In these methods, typically elements are removed or added based on thesensitivity of an element or node as measured by the change in the structure’s meancompliance of removing that element or node. 17.8 Summary The unique capabilities of AM technologies enable new opportunities for designersto explore new methods for customizing products, improving product performance,cutting manufacturing and assembly costs, and in general developing new ways toconceptualize products. In this chapter, we compared traditional DFM approachesto DFAM. AM enables tremendous improvements in many of the considerationsthat are important to DFM due to the capabilities of shape, hierarchical, functional,and material complexity. Through a series of examples, new concepts enabled byAM were presented that illustrate various methods of exploring design freedoms. No doubt, many new concepts will be developed in future years. Challenges and potential methods for new CAD tools were presented to overcome the limitations oftraditional parametric, solid-modeling CAD systems. A brief overview of optimi-zation methods was given to illustrate some automated synthesis methods fordesigning complex structures. Several examples were given to illustrate the typesof solutions that can be generated; the resulting geometries are complex enough topreclude fabrication using conventional manufacturing processes. This chapter covered a snapshot of design concepts, examples, and research results in the broad area of DFAM. In future years, a much wider variety of concepts should emerge that lead to revolutionary ways of conceiving and developingproducts.17.8 Summary 43317.9 Exercises 1.–4. Describe in your own words the four AM unique design capabilities described in this chapter and give one example of a product that could beimproved by the proper application of each design capability. The example products cannot be ones that were mentioned in this book. What are three ways that current designers are trained that are at odds with the concept of DFAM? Why is optimization a more challenging issue with DFAM than for DFM?7. For one of the products identiﬁed in problems 1–4, draw in CAD the original design and your redesign based upon the application of DFAM principles.

Int J Numer Meth Engng 78:379–402References 435Rapid Tooling18 Abstract This chapter discusses how additive manufacturing can be used to develop tooling solutions. Although AM is not well suited to high-volume productionin a direct digital manufacturing sense, it does have some beneﬁt when produc-ing volume production tools. This can be from the perspective of using AM tocreate patterns for parts that are required using materials or properties not currently available using AM or for longer run tooling where AM may be able to simplify the process chain. Commonly referred to as rapid tooling, we discusshere how AM can contribute to the product manufacturing processes. 18.1 Introduction The term “tooling” refers in this case to the use of AM to create production tools.The tool is therefore an impression, pattern, or mold from which a ﬁnal part can betaken. There is a variety of different ways in which this can be achieved and thesewill be discussed in this chapter. In recent years, as can be seen from other chapters in this book, there has been a tendency to attempt to use AM for production of parts directly from the machine.This is the so-called Direct Digital Manufacture (DDM) and there are numerous reasons why this can be a preferable approach to production. However, there are still a number of reasons for creating tooling rather than DDM: The larger the number of parts produced, the more cost-effective it may be to make a production tool, provided it is known how many parts can be made usingsuch a tool. The material requirements for the ﬁnal part may be very speciﬁc and not currently available as an AM material but may however be possible through the tooling route. #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_18437• It may be that the product developer wants to understand the tooling process and thus use AM to create a prototype tool. This may actually be the quickest and most effective way to create the tooling according to the required speciﬁcations. This may be particularly relevant where short lead-times are important. Tooling is often broken up into two types, referred to as “short-run” and “long- run” tooling. Although discussed in numerous articles like those by Pham andDimov [ 1], there are no speciﬁc deﬁnitions for either of these. Therefore we will attempt to distinguish them here. Short-run tooling may also be referred to as prototype tooling or soft tooling. The objective is to use techniques that achieve a tool quickly, at low cost and with few process stages. Quite often there are a number of manual steps in the process. Itis understood that only a few parts are likely to result from use of the tool; possiblyeven just one or two parts up to around 100 or more. Every time the tool is used, itshould be inspected for damage and viability. It may even be possible (or necessary)to repair the tool before it can be used again. It should be noted that if a toolingsolution is required in a very short time (say in a few days), then AM-based short-run tooling may be the only way to arrive there. Long-run tooling has greater emphasis on use of tooling for mass production purposes. Some injection molding tools can last for years and millions of parts.Although wear is always going to occur, the wear-rate is very low due to the relativehardness of the tool compared with the resulting parts that come from them. Theprocesses required to create long-run tools from AM would still be chosen for theirrelative cost and lead-time, but in this case they are more likely compared withconventional (subtractive) manufacturing processes. Almost every AM-based long-run tooling solution is likely to involve a metal fabrication process. The beneﬁts of using a rapid tooling solution may be difﬁcult to determine, but could be immense. Very rarely is a product created from a single tool and the morecomplex the product, the more difﬁcult it is to plan. Consider the problem ofbringing a new mass-produced car to the market. Some parts will already beavailable, some existing parts may require redesigning while others will requiredesign from scratch. Some of these new parts will be relatively simple, while otherswill have signiﬁcant performance speciﬁcations that could have very long lead-times. Now consider how you would create a plan to bring all these together so that the car is launched on schedule. Even the manufacture of a very simple part could delay the whole process. The use of AM-based short-run and long-run tooling canbe extremely beneﬁcial because of the short reaction times and simpliﬁed processchains. A car manufacturer may be able to plan more easily and react todisturbances in the process chain more efﬁciently. Even tooling that does not lastvery long (or, for that matter, DDM) can be used to bridge the gap to long-termtooling made using conventional methods. Delivery times can be met even thoughthe entire mass production facility has yet to be completed. The majority of rapid tooling solutions are focused on the creation of injection molding (IM) tooling. This is because there are a huge number of products made438 18 Rapid Toolingfrom polymers using this approach. We will go on in this chapter to discuss how we can directly fabricate IM parts using AM as a replacement for subtractive machin-ing processes. Electron discharge machining (EDM) is an alternative to the more conventional abrasive metal cutting that is worth separate consideration in this chapter. Of course, not all products are made from polymer parts. There is a hugevariety of metal, ceramic, and composite-based materials and relatedmanufacturing methods. One method that ﬁts very well into an AM process chainis investment casting, which we will discuss here, followed by some less main-stream AM-based approaches that have found niches for some manufacturers. 18.2 Direct AM Production of Injection Molding Inserts Wikipedia describes injection molding as the most common modern method ofmanufacturing parts and that it is ideal to produce high volumes of the same part[2]. The general principle is quite straightforward in that molten polymer is forced into a metal mold. A simple IM machine diagram can be seen in Fig. 18.1. Once the polymer has cooled and solidiﬁed, the mold splits open to reveal the part which isthen ejected and the process repeats. There are many texts that cover IM in varying levels of detail. An excellent online resource can be found from Bolur [ 4]. From these we can see that, similar to many processes, optimization and maximization ofthe output from IM can be very complex. As our demand for higher throughput,performance, quality, etc. increases so will the need for more cost-effectivesolutions. Since the IM process requires a mold that can somehow separate for the part to be removed, there are a number of issues that require attention: A simple mold will have a cavity into which the polymer is injected. A core will form the other side of the mold, which is removed after the cooling process sothat the part can be ejected. A mechanism (usually a set of ejector pins) isengaged to push the part out from the cavity. However, for this to be effective,the cavity walls usually have a slight slope (referred to as a “draft angle”) thatreduces shear forces between the polymer and the mold that would cause the partto stick. Not all molds can be easily split into a simple core/cavity to reveal the part. Complex geometry parts may require mold sets that separate into more than two segments. Parts may require very careful redesign so that the number of moldcomponents is minimized. Even so, mold sets can be very complex. Filling the mold with molten polymer can also be problematic. The mold must be completely full before it starts to solidify, else there may be cavities. Parts thatcomprise many features, like thick or thin walls, ribs, bosses, etc. must becarefully analyzed to ensure the mold set is properly ﬁlled. Very complexparts may require multiple injection and venting points to ensure effective mold ﬁlling as well as ﬁne-tuning of the temperatures, pressures and cycle18.2 Direct AM Production of Injection Molding Inserts 439operations within the IM machine. There are numerous softwares available for mold operation analysis, like Moldﬂow [ 5]. As can be seen in Figs. 18.1 and18.2, an IM machine has a standard plate set into which mold sets are inserted. For these inserts, it is necessary to know where to locate the injection point, the ejector pins, risers, and other features that comprise a fully functioning mold solution. It is these inserts that effectively “customize” the process and where AM can therefore contribute towards a solution. Inserts can be made using either metal or polymer AM technology. Polymer inserts are obviously less durable, but are much quicker and cheaper to make. In a white paper published by Stratasys, the Polyjet process was demonstrated to be effective for producing inserts for a variety of applications [ 6]. Figure 18.3 shows Polyjet inserts for a 2-cavity set, with a close-up of the ejector pin arrangement. IM applications have been tested using the standard Polyjet materials. Best results were presented for the Digital ABS material. Parts were made in a conven- tional IM machines using a variety of materials, including polyamide, ABS, and polyethylene at temperatures up to 300/C14C. Up to 100 cycles have been observed before the inserts broke. Similar results have been reported using SL and polymer laser sintered parts. It is important to note that the IM inserts made this way should be handled carefully so that they can achieve acceptable results. Even though the IM process operates above the heat deﬂection temperature for the AM materials, it is still possible to get acceptable molded parts. This is possible if the IM cycle is lengthened so that the parts can cool more inside the mold before separation and ejection. Note that this only really works for relatively simple core/cavity sets. For this type of application, the costs can be around half of similar aluminum molds, with signiﬁcant reductions in lead-time. One can expect some hand-ﬁnishing of the resulting molded parts. Fig. 18.1 A simple IM machine setup as drawn by Rockey [ 3]440 18 Rapid ToolingThe primary concerns when making mold inserts using polymer AM are heat deﬂection, wear, and accuracy. Most AM processes can provide partial solutions to these problems, but generally the most accurate processes have low heat deﬂection temperatures and the highest temperature materials can be found in lower accuracyprocesses. A number of attempts have been made to develop materials for IMinserts with polymer AM processes. One material of note is the copper-polyamidematerial that was developed for the polymer powder bed fusion process. Adding acopper ﬁller to the polyamide matrix material served to improve the heat transferaway from the surface when a mold is used in the IM machine. The copper alsoprovided additional wear resistance, which increases the life of the mold. It is interesting to note however that this is not a widely used material as the copper- polyamide is not very useful for many other applications so only appropriate wherea large number of these molds are needed. Fig. 18.2 A core/cavity mold set showing a central injection point and channeling to regions where5 different parts are formed inone cycle Fig. 18.3 Polyjet inserts for a two cavity mold set, showing a close-up of the ejector pins (courtesy Stratasys)18.2 Direct AM Production of Injection Molding Inserts 441A number of chapters in this book discuss AM of metal parts. One of the initial drivers for this technology was for IM mold inserts. AM can provide a near-netshape for the metal inserts. Several materials have been developed for metal AM that could be used for this, but the most widely used would be H13 tool steel. Almost every process that can achieve this is based on powder metal sintering.Near-net shape can be achieved up to an Ra surface roughness of 12–20 μm but this would generally not be acceptable for most applications and machining of theparting surfaces in particular would be necessary. If the mold surface also requiresmachine ﬁnishing, then very careful attention must be given to gaging so that all ofthe original part lies outside of the machining volume. Incorrect gaging could leadto some regions not having sufﬁcient stock material to achieve an adequate surface. It is therefore common for designers to add material to the CAD model as a machining allowance. Figure 18.4 shows a tool set where the inserts were made using a powder metal system, with two parts that were molded from them. Early metal powder AM machines were very expensive and suffered from problems with accuracy and consistent material properties. At that time therewere a few alternative approaches to creating metal parts in the Rapid Steel [ 6] and KelTool [ 7] processes. While these approaches have become virtually obsolete, there was distinct advantage in that these processes could result in a fully metal part but using a conventional polymer AM machine. However, there was the need for additional furnace technology that added to the expense of the process. Powder sintering could also be used to create parts that are a blend of polymer and metal powders. The polymeric material acts as a matrix that can hold the metalpowder in place. The use of a high thermally conductive metal powder, like copper,would be the most ideal to use for the purpose of creating IM tooling inserts. Thecopper would cause heat energy to conduct away from the matrix polymer, thusallowing more rapid cooling during the IM process. The copper powder, being harder and more durable than the polymer, would also enable longer tool life. One signiﬁcant beneﬁt to the use of AM for creation of injection mold tooling is the capability of creating conformal cooling channels. It is normal to run coolantthrough the IM inserts, facilitating the cooling of the plastic part following theinjection of the molten polymer. This cooling process is very dependent on thegeometry of the part being molded, with larger voluminous segments coolingslower than smaller, thinner sections. Greater ﬂow of coolant close to the largersegments can enable faster and more regular cooling, which can also improve the part quality by preventing part warpage due to thermally induced stress. The geometric freedom that is a characteristic of AM can enable very complex coolingchannels to be designed into the part. While the best way to achieve such conformalcooling is very much open to debate, beneﬁts have been cataloged [ 8,9]. An example of conformal cooling can be seen in Fig. 18.5. Note that this approach can be applied to both short- and long-run methods.442 18 Rapid Tooling18.3 EDM Electrodes A number of attempts have been made to develop EDM electrodes by plating AM parts [ 10]. These electrodes could feasibly be used for die-sinking EDM for creating cavities for IM application. The most common method of plating the polymer AMparts would be by using electroless plating of copper. There are two majordrawbacks to this plating approach. The ﬁrst is that electroless plating is best suitedto plating a thin layer of material on a surface. For EDM however, the electrodes aremore effective with a thicker amount of conductive material deposited. It is difﬁcult to deposit sufﬁciently thick material in a quick and easy manner and with control- lable thickness. This leads to the second problem, which is that even if you candeposit sufﬁcient material, the deﬁnition of the electrode will be compromised by Fig. 18.4 A direct metal laser sintered tool set, with two parts that have been molded from them Fig. 18.5 A tool insert design, showing the location of conformal cooling channels18.3 EDM Electrodes 443this excessively thick layer of material. Although possible, it is not a very effective method of making electrodes. While it may be possible to create an electrode using powder metallurgy methods from AM molds, possibly a more effective method would be to use direct metal fabrication. Stucker, et al. [ 11] used this approach to create electrodes using Zirconium diBoride (ZrB 2). This material was encapsulated in a copper matrix material, which was melted using a selective laser melting approach. The resultingmetal matrix composite was observed to have good erosion characteristics, wearingapproximately 1/16th the rate of a pure copper electrode. Neither of the above approaches has achieved popularity and there appear to be much better ways of creating EDM electrodes. However, recent improvements in metal powder melting systems may revive this research and development since electrode production can account for a signiﬁcant amount of the manufacturingcosts. 18.4 Investment Casting Investment casting is the process of generating metal parts from a nonmetal pattern. Figure 18.6 efﬁciently describes the investment casting process. The patterns are in some way assembled into a structure that can be coated with ceramic to produce ashell. The ceramic starts as a slurry into which the structure, referred to as a “tree”for obvious reasons, is dipped to produce a closely forming skin. Once this hasdried, it is strengthened by applying more coats until it is strong enough towithstand the casting process. Prior to casting, the pattern is removed by burningout the material. Care must be taken at this stage to ensure all the material has beenburned out of the shell, leaving no residue. The ceramic shell can withstand the high temperature of molten metal during the pouring process, which can then be left to cool before the shell is broken from the tree. The metal replicas of the originalpattern are cut from the “trunk” of the structure prior to post-treatment. The great advantage of this is that parts can be made in a wide range of materials, speciﬁc to the application. While powder metal AM systems can produce partsdirectly in metal, there is a much more limited range of metals available. Further-more, this is an approach that can result in metal parts from a nonmetal AMtechnology. A number of AM processes are capable of directly making parts in wax, including material jetting and material extrusion. However, it is also possible to make investment casting patterns from other materials, including polycarbonateand ABS, which are available from a wide range of AM machines. The key is toensure that the material does not expand rapidly during the burnout process, prior tothe metal casting. One way to achieve this is to apply the honeycomb coreapproach, such as the SL QuickCast build style, rather than using a solid ﬁll.444 18 Rapid Tooling18.5 Other Systems The main purpose of this chapter is to describe the wide range of ways that AM can be used to enhance your manufacturing processes. While there is a push to using AM for direct digital manufacturing, there are still many products that require mass production and here we can see that AM can still contribute. Although injectionmolding and investment casting are probably the most widely used applications,there are numerous other approaches that have been considered. Below are a fewother examples where AM can be used to help solve manufacturing problems. 18.5.1 Vacuum Forming Tools Vacuum forming is commonly used in packaging, where plastic parts are formedfrom a ﬂat sheet. A typical example is the clear blister packaging that is commonlyused to display consumer products. Other examples include parts that form an outershell for a product, like a plastic safety helmet for example. After the forming, it iscommon to cut away the material that surrounds the shaped plastic. Heat and vacuum are applied when the sheet is placed over a tool, which has holes through which the vacuumed air is extracted. This allows the sheet to conform Fig. 18.6 Schematic of the investment casting process. Courtesy of CustomPart at custompartnet.com18.5 Other Systems 445to the shape of the tool. If a small number of formed parts are required in a series plastic, then the tool could be fabricated using AM. Locating the vacuum holeswould be a straightforward process and can be included during the build. Since the heat is not directly targeted at the tool and with the pressures and other forces not being very high, it is acceptable to use polymeric materials that are commonly usedin AM, like ABS or nylon. 18.5.2 Paper Pulp Molding Tools It is becoming quite popular to use paper pulp molding techniques to createpackaging. The pulp is made from recycled paper and therefore very environmen- tally friendly. The forming process is also quite sustainable since it does not require much energy to create the shapes since they are primarily created by pressing outthe excess water from the pulp. Again, if the packaging is for small volume partproduction, AM can be used to create the forming tools. The tools can be createdquite quickly using a honeycomb ﬁll to reduce build time, weight, and materialcosts. Furthermore, features can be included to facilitate the excess waterchanneling. Figure 18.7 shows a typical mold and part made using this approach. 18.5.3 Formwork for Composite Manufacture Carbon and glass ﬁber composite is an increasingly popular material used to manufacture high performance items that require signiﬁcant strength to weightratios. This is particularly important for vehicles, where the reduction in weightcan reduce the energy requirements to move it around. Use of AM can assist in thisprocess, particularly where complex shapes are involved. Use of honeycomb coreAM build methods can assist in the creation of lightweight patterns around which ﬁber reinforced composites can be wound. Alternatively, AM parts can act as molds into which carbon or glass ﬁber reinforced polymers (CFRP or GFRP) can beplaced, either pre-impregnated (prepreg) or by applying the resin later. The AMpart can be kept inside the composite part in some cases or the AM pattern can beseparated from the composite after the resin curing (hardening) stage. The fact thatsome AM materials can be dissolved away could be useful at this stage. Figure 18.8 shows some parts that have been developed for constructing high performanceUAVs (unmanned air vehicles) using CFRP. The white parts are all made using AM. 18.5.4 Assembly Tools and Metrology Registration Rigs The majority of products made are assembled in some way from multiple components. Any technique that can simplify or accelerate the assembly processcan be extremely beneﬁcial to a mass market manufacturer. We discuss the beneﬁts446 18 Rapid Toolingof DDM in terms of part simpliﬁcation to reduce the assembly costs elsewhere in this book. However, even for assembly-based manufacture using conventionallymade components AM can make a contribution. Some assembly processes beneﬁtfrom the use of jigs that make it easier to perform the tasks by keeping some of the components in place as well as ensuring that all the components are present, like the example shown in Fig. 18.9. A variation of this approach can be seen with the metrology ﬁxation system produced by Materialise to ensure automotive and Fig. 18.7 A paper pulp molding tool shown with a molded packaging component (Courtesy of RedEye Redeyeondemand.com) Fig. 18.8 Polymer melt extruded AM parts used as formwork for carboncomposite manufacture18.5 Other Systems 447similar moldings are kept in place during the metrology process for quality assur- ance purposes [ 12]. 18.6 Exercises Are there any other reasons for using AM to create tooling other than the 4 mentioned at the beginning of this chapter? What different IM ﬂow analysis software can you ﬁnd on the Internet? Make a list of the different metal AM technologies that are available. What materials are available for creating IM tooling inserts? Can you ﬁnd anyexamples of inserts that have been developed? Find two examples of conformal cooling from the web. Can you identify which method is better? Why is it better? Investigate the manufacture and use of EDM electrodes. What are the potential beneﬁts and pitfalls surrounding the use of AM to directly fabricate theseelectrodes? There are certainly other examples of mass-manufacturing processes that use AM technology. Build a portfolio of examples and use as a means to discuss howthey can beneﬁt in terms of time, cost, ease of use, etc. References Pham DT, Dimov SS (2003) Rapid prototyping and rapid tooling—the key enablers for rapid manufacturing.

During that period, we have experienced a number ofsigniﬁcant changes that has led to improvements in accuracy, better mechanicalproperties, a broader range of applications, and reductions in costs of machinesand the parts made by them. In this chapter we explore the evolution of the ﬁeld and how these developments have impacted a variety of applications over time. We note also that different applications beneﬁt from different aspects of AM,highlighting the versatility of this technology. 19.1 Introduction Additive manufacturing is coming into its third decade of commercial technologi-cal development. During that period, we have experienced a number of signiﬁcantchanges that has led to improvements in accuracy, better mechanical properties, abroader range of applications, and reductions in costs of machines and the partsmade by them. Also in previous chapters, we have seen that AM technologies canvary according to the following nonexclusive list of parameters: Cost: Since some machines employ more expensive technologies, like lasers, they will inevitably cost more than others. Range of materials : Some machines can only process one or two materials, while others can process more, including composites. Maintenance : With some machines being more complex than others, the main- tenance requirements will differ. Some companies will add cost to their machines toensure that they are better supported. Speed : Due to the technologies applied, some machines will build parts faster than others. #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_19451Versatility : Some machines have complex setup parameters where part quality can be balanced against other parameters, like build speed. Other machines havefewer setup variations that make them easier to use but perhaps less versatile. Layer thickness : Some machines have a limitation on the layer thickness due to the material processing parameters. Making these layers thinner would inevitablyslow the build speed. Accuracy : Aside from layer thickness, in-plane resolution also has an impact on accuracy. This may particularly affect minimum feature size and wall thickness of apart. For example, laser-based systems have a minimum feature size that is based onthe diameter of the laser beam. Driven by the automotive, aerospace, and medical industries, AM has found applications in design and development within almost every consumer product sector imaginable. As AM becomes more popular and as technology costs inevita-bly decrease, this can only serve to generate more momentum and further broadenthe range of applications. This momentum has been added to with the recentaddition of commercial AM machines that can directly process metal powders. This chapter discusses the use of AM for medical, aerospace and automotive applications which have consistently been the key industries driving innovation inAM. With aerospace and automotive industries, AM is valued mainly because of the complex geometric capabilities and the time that can be saved in development of products. With medicine, the beneﬁt is primarily in the ability to include patient-speciﬁc data from medical sources so that customized solutions to medicalproblems can be found. We begin with a brief survey of historical developmentsin rapid prototyping (RP), rapid tooling, and other advances, with a focus mostly onaerospace and automotive industries. 19.2 Historical Developments In the late 1980s, 3D Systems started selling their ﬁrst stereolithography machines.The ﬁrst ﬁve customers of the SLA-1 beta program were AMP Incorporated,General Motors, Baxter Health Care, Eastman Kodak, and Pratt & Whitney[1]. These companies represent the four largest industrial sectors, in terms of historical AM usage, including automotive (GM and AMP, their automotive andconsumer business group was the customer), health care (Baxter), consumer products (Eastman Kodak), and aerospace (Pratt & Whitney). Texas Instruments, speciﬁcally their Defense Systems & Electronics Group, was also an early adopterwho applied AM to the aerospace ﬁeld. Similarly, one of the ﬁrst customers ofDTM was BF Goodrich, which is a supplier to the aerospace and automotiveindustries. Focusing on the aerospace industry, many success stories were realized by design and manufacturing engineers who used AM for rapid prototyping purposes.In many cases, thousands of dollars and months of product development time were saved through the use of RP, since prototype parts did not have to be fabricated452 19 Applications for Additive Manufactureusing conventional manufacturing processes. Additionally, many new applications for AM parts were discovered. 19.2.1 Value of Physical Models Early adopters discovered that AM, through the rapid prototyping function,provided several beneﬁts including enhanced visualization, the ability to detectdesign ﬂaws, reduced prototyping time, and signiﬁcant cost reductions associatedwith the ability to develop correct designs quickly. Of course, there were alsosigniﬁcant costs associated with being an early adopter. AM machines were moreexpensive than conventional machine tools and people had to be hired and trainedto run the AM machines. New post-processing equipment had to be installed and hazardous solvents used to clean SL parts. But, for those companies willing to take the risk, the signiﬁcant investments in AM had a large return-on-investment whenAM was integrated into their product development processes. For example, in 1992, Texas Instruments reported several case studies demonstrating thousands of dollars and months of prototyping time saved throughthe use of stereolithography [ 1]. Furthermore, they were one of the ﬁrst companies to explore the use of SL parts as patterns for investment casting. Chrysler purchased two SLA-250 machines in early 1990 and reported that they fabricated over 1,500 parts in the ﬁrst 2 years of usage, with the machines running virtually 24 h per day and 7 days per week [ 1]. They also reported signiﬁcant time and cost savings particularly for form/ﬁt and packaging assessments. They andother companies soon realized that they could greatly increase their chances ofwinning contracts to supply parts if they included RP parts with their quotes. Byincluding physical prototypes, they can demonstrate that they understand the designrequirements and both customer and supplier can identify potential problemsearly on. In the medical industry, Depuy, Inc. was another early adopter of SL. They reported on a project that began in 1990 to develop a new line of shoulder implantswith dozens of models for various component sizes [ 1]. They used SL models, fabricated on their in-house SLA-250 machines, of the implant components duringseveral iterations of early project reviews, saved several months of developmenttime, and avoided costly changes before production. Furthermore, they used SLmasters for urethane tooling to make wax patterns for investment casting for theﬁrst 500 pieces of each size. As they noted, this allowed them to proceed with product launch as part of their development process. 19.2.2 Functional Testing Engineers at aerospace, automotive, and medical device companies soon discov- ered that AM parts could be used for a variety of functional testing applications.Speciﬁcally ﬂow testing was investigated by these companies, even with the early19.2 Historical Developments 453SL resins that were brittle and absorbed water easily. As one example, Chrysler tested air ﬂow through several cylinder head designs in early 1992. They built amodel of the cylinder head geometry in SL, installed steel valves and springs, then ran the model on their ﬂow bench. They achieved a 38 % improvement in air ﬂow. Other companies reported similar experiences. Engineers at Pratt & Whitney pioneered several new types of ﬂow apparatus and experiments with SL in the earlyyears with both air and water. A report from Porsche in 1994 described water ﬂowtesting in a series of engine models to study coolant ﬂow characteristics [ 2]. By using SL and an early epoxy resin, they could successfully design, fabricate, andtest engine models within about 1 week per iteration. Also in 1994, Allied Signal reported on a study where SL models of turbine blades were used to determine their frequency spectra [ 2]. To study the use of SL models, they built SL models at full scale and at 3:1 scale, tested all three bladesexperimentally, and compared the results to ﬁnite element analysis. Theoretically,the full-scale SL models should have natural frequencies that are 35.7 % of those ofthe steel blades; experimentally, they determined that the SL blades exhibitedfrequencies 35 % less. Similarly, the 3:1 scale SL blades had natural frequenciesthat were 12 % of the steel blade frequencies, compared to a theoretical predictionof 11.9 %. In comparison, FEA predictions ranged from 3.6 % lower to 19.4 % higher than experimental results. As a consequence, Allied Signal had much more conﬁdence in their use of SL models than FEA, since the SL models enabled muchmore accurate determinations of natural frequencies. Concurrently, aerospace companies started using AM parts to perform wind tunnel testing. Wind tunnel models are typically instrumented with arrays ofpressure sensors. Standard metal models required considerable machining inorder to fabricate channels for all of the wiring to the sensors. With AM, thechannels and sensor mounts could be designed into the model. Automotive companies also adopted this practice. For high-speed testing, or large aerospace models, rapid tooling methods were commonly used in order to fabricate stiffermetal wind tunnel models. With proper designs, engineers could design thechannels and sensor mounts into the AM patterns that were subsequently used toproduce the tooling. 19.2.3 Rapid Tooling Prior to 1992, Chrysler experimented with a variety of rapid tooling processes withstereolithography master patterns. This included vacuum forming, resin transfermolding, sand casting, squeeze molding, and silicone molding. Many of these techniques were covered in the previous chapter. The point here is to put this activity in a historical context and realize how early in the AM ﬁeld’s developmentthese applications were investigated. An area of signiﬁcant effort in both the aerospace and automotive industries was the use of SL parts as investment casting patterns. Early experiments used thin-walled SL patterns or hollow parts. Because SL resins expand more than investment454 19 Applications for Additive Manufacturecasting wax, when used as patterns, the SL part tended to expand and crack the ceramic shell. This led to the development of the QuickCast ™pattern style in 1992, which is a type of lattice structure that was added automatically to hollow part STL ﬁles by SL machine pre-processing software. The QuickCast style was designed to support thin walls but not to be too strong. Upon heating and thermal expansion, theQuickCast lattice struts were designed to ﬂex, collapse inward, break, but nottransfer high loads to the part skins which could crack the shell. The QuickCast 1.0 style worked, but not as well as desired. This led to the development of QuickCast 1.1 by 3D Systems in 1995 and then QuickCast 2.0 byPhill Dickens and Richard Hague at the University of Nottingham in the late 1990s.This was quickly adopted by many manufacturers and service bureaus and, argu- ably, revolutionized the investment casting industry. Another interesting development in the early 2000s was the large-frame binder jetting technology by ExOne, where a sand material was developed that wassuitable for use as sand casting dies. As mentioned in Chap. 8, ExOne marketed the S15 binder jetting machine for several years (the technology was purchasedfrom a German company Generis GmbH in 2003). As one example, two of thesesand machines were operating at the Ford Dunton Technical Center in England inthe mid-2000s (they may still be operational) to support their design and develop- ment activities. Much of the Ford of Europe operations are housed here, including small car design, powertrain design and development, and some commercialvehicles. As of the end of 2005, ExOne had reportedly sold 19 S15 machines,each of which cost over $1M. More recently, Boeing, Northrop-Grumman and other aerospace companies have used material extrusion technology to fabricate tooling. They developedtooling designs for composite part lay-up that were suitable for ME fabrication.Other reported tooling applications included drill guides and various assembly tools. 19.3 The Use of AM to Support Medical Applications AM models have been used for medical applications almost from the very start, when this technology was ﬁrst commercialized. AM could not have existed before3D CAD since the technology is digitally driven. Computerized Tomography(CT) was also a technology that developed alongside 3D representation techniques.Figure 19.1 shows a CT machine, a model directly generated from this machine (shown as cross-sectional slices) and a model with all segments combined into a 3Dimage. CT is an X-ray-based technique that moves the sensors in 3D space relative to the X-ray source so that a correlation can be made between the position and the absorption proﬁle. By combining multiple images in this way, a 3D image can bebuilt up. The level of absorption of the X-rays is dependent on the density of thesubject matter, with bone showing up very well because it is much denser than thesurrounding soft tissue. What some people don’t realize is that soft tissue imagescan also be created using CT technology. Clinicians use CT technology to create 3D19.3 The Use of AM to Support Medical Applications 455images for viewing the subject from any angle, so as to better understand any associated medical condition. Note that this is one of a number of developing technologies working in the 3D domain, including 3D MRI, 3D Ultrasound, and 3D laser scanning (for external imaging). With this increasing use of 3D medical imaging technology, the need to share and order this data across platforms has led to information exchange standards like DICOM [ 3], from the National Electrical Manufacturers Association in the USA, which allows users to view patient data with a variety of different software and sourced from a variety of different imaging platforms. While originally used just for imaging and diagnostic purposes, 3D medical imaging data quickly found its way into CAD/CAM systems, with AM technology being the most effective means of realizing these models due to the complex, organic nature of the input forms. Medical data generated from patients is essen- tially unique to an individual. The automated and de-skilled form of production that AM provides makes it an obvious route for generating products from patient data. AM-based fabrication contributes signiﬁcantly to one or more of the following different categories of medical applications: Surgical and diagnostic aids Prosthetics development Manufacturing of medically related products Tissue Engineering We will now go on to discuss how AM is useful to these application areas and some of the issues surrounding their implementation. Fig. 19.1 A CT scanner with sliced images and a 3D image created using this technology456 19 Applications for Additive Manufacture19.3.1 Surgical and Diagnostic Aids The use of AM for diagnostic purpose was probably the ﬁrst medical application of AM. Surgeons are often considered to be as much artists as they are technically proﬁcient. Since many of their tasks involve working inside human bodies, much of their operating procedure is carried out using the sense of touch almost as much asby vision. As such, models that they can both see from any angle and feel with theirhands are very useful to them. Surgeons work in teams with support from doctors and nurses during operations and from medical technicians prior to those operations. They use models in order tounderstand the complex surgical procedures for themselves as well as to communi-cate with others in the team. Complex surgical procedures also require patient understanding and compliance and so the surgeon can use these models to assist in this process too. AM models have been known to help reduce time in surgery forcomplex cases, both by allowing the surgeons to better plan ahead of time and forthem to understand the situation better during the procedure (by having the modelon hand to refer to within the operating theater). Machine vendors have, therefore,developed a range of materials that can allow sterilization of parts so that modelscan be brought inside the operating theater without contamination. Most applications relate to models made of bony tissue resulting from CT data rather than using soft tissue constructs. MRI data, which is more commonly used for soft tissue imaging, can also be used and cases with complex vascular models havebeen reported [ 4]. Bone, however, is more obvious because many of the materials used in AM machines actually resemble bone in some way and can even respond tocutting operations in a similar manner. AM models of soft tissue may be useful forsome visualizations, but less can be learned from practicing surgery on them sincethey will not be compliant in the same way. Many models may beneﬁt from havingdifferent colors to highlight important features. Such models can display tumors, cavities, vascular tracks, etc. Material extrusion and jetting technologies can both be used to represent this kind of part, but probably the most impressive visualmodels can be made using the colored binder jetting process from 3D Systems.Sometimes, these features may be buried inside bone or other tissue and so havingan opaque material encased in a transparent material can also be helpful in thesesituations. For this, the Stereocol resin that was independently developed for SLAmachines [ 5] or the Connex material from Stratasys [ 6] can be used to see inside the part. The Stereocol material no longer appears to be commercially available, however. Some examples of different parts that illustrate this capability can be seen in Fig. 19.2. Some of the most noteworthy applications of AM as medical models were from well-publicized surgeries to separate conjoined twins. Surgeons reported that hav-ing multicolored, complex models of the head or abdomen areas were invaluable inplanning the surgeries, which can take 12–24 h and involve teams of surgeons andsupport staff [ 7].19.3 The Use of AM to Support Medical Applications 45719.3.2 Prosthetics Development Initially, CT generated 3D data combined with the low resolution of earlier AM technology to create models that may have looked anatomically correct, but that were perhaps not very accurate when compared with the actual patient. As the technology improved in both areas, models have become more precise and it is now possible to use them in combination for fabrication of close-ﬁtting prosthetic devices. Wang [ 8] states that CT-based measurement can be as close as 0.2 mm from the actual value. While this is subjective, it is clear that resulting models, when built properly, can be sufﬁciently precise to suit many applications. Support from CAD software can add to the process of model development by including ﬁxtures for orientation, tooling guidance, and for screwing into bones. For example, it is quite common for surgeons to use ﬂexible titanium mesh as a bone replacement in cancer cases or as a method for joining pieces of broken bone together, prior to osteointegration. While described as ﬂexible, this material still requires tools in order to bend the material. Models can be used as templates for these meshes, allowing the surgeon’s technical staff to precisely bend the mesh to shape so that minimal rework is required during surgery. Figure 19.3 shows a maxillofacial model that has been used for this purpose [ 9]. Fig. 19.2 Images of medical parts made using different colored AM systems. ( a) 3DP used to make a skull with vascular tracks in a darker color. ( b) A bone tumor highlighted using ABS. ( c) Stratasys Connex process showing vascularity inside a human organ458 19 Applications for Additive ManufactureAlternatively, many AM processes can create parts that can be used as casting patterns or reference patterns for other manufacturing processes. Many prosthetics comprise components that have a range of sizes to ﬁt a standard population distribution. However, this means that precise ﬁtting is often not possible and so the patient may still experience some postoperative difﬁculties. These difﬁculties can further result in additional requirements for rehabilitation or even corrective surgery, thus adding to the cost of the entire treatment. Greater comfort and performance can be achieved where some of the components are customized, based on actual patient data. An example would be the socket ﬁxation for a total hip joint replacement. While a standardized process will often return joint func- tionality to the patient, incorrect ﬁxation of the socket commonly results in variable motion that may be a discomfort, painful and require extensive physiotherapy to overcome. Customized ﬁxtures can be made directly in titanium or cobalt–chro- mium (both of which are widely used for implants) using powder bed fusion technology. Such custom devices would reduce the previously mentioned problems by making it possible to more precisely match the original or preferred geometry and kinematics. The use of metal systems provides considerable beneﬁt here. While metal AM systems are not capable of producing the smooth surface ﬁnish required for effective joint articulation, the characteristic slight roughness can actually beneﬁt osteointegration when placed inside the bone. Smooth joint articulation can be achieved through extensive polishing and use of coatings. Most metal systems may provide custom-shaped implants, but the use of highly focused energy beams will mean that the microstructure will be different and the parts may be more brittle than their equivalent cast or forged components; making brittle fracture from excessive impact loading a distinct possibility. An excellent example of this can be found in the case shown in Fig. 19.4, where Prof. J. Poukens led a multidisciplinary team to implant a complete titanium mandibular joint into an 83-year-old woman [ 10]. Fig. 19.3 Titanium mesh formed around a maxillofacial model19.3 The Use of AM to Support Medical Applications 45919.3.3 Manufacturing There are now examples where customized prosthetics have found their way into mainstream product manufacture. The two examples that are most well known in the industry are in-the-ear hearing aids from companies like Siemens and Phonak and the Invisalign range of orthodontic aligners as developed by Align Technology [11]. These examples are discussed in detail in Chap. 16. Both of these applications involve taking precise data from an individual and applying this to the basic generic design of a product. The patient data are generated by a medical specialist who is familiar with the procedure and who is able to determine whether the treatment will be beneﬁcial. Specialized software is used that allows the patient data to be manipulated and incorporated into the medical device. One key to success for customized prosthetics is the ability to perform the design process quickly and easily. The production process often involves AM plus numer- ous other conventional manufacturing tasks, and in some cases the parts may even be more expensive to produce; but the product will perform more effectively and can sell at a premium price because it has components which suit a speciﬁc user. This added value can make the prosthetic less intrusive and more comfortable for the user. Additionally, the use of a direct digital manufacturing makes it easier for manufacturers and practitioners. 19.3.4 Tissue Engineering and Organ Printing The ultimate in fabrication of medical implants would be the direct fabrication of replacement body parts. This can feasibly be done using AM technology, where the Fig. 19.4 Titanium jaw implant being located during surgery460 19 Applications for Additive Manufacturematerials being deposited are living cells, proteins, and other materials that assist in the generation of integrated tissue structures. However, although there is a greatdeal of active research in this area, practical applications are still in the main some way off. The most likely approach would be to use printing and extrusion-based technology to undertake this deposition process. This is because droplet-basedprinting technology has the ability to precisely locate very small amounts of liquidmaterial and extrusion-based techniques are well suited to build soft tissue scaf-folding. However, ensuring that these materials are deposited under environmentalconditions conducive to cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation is not a trivialtask. This methodology could eventually lead to the fabrication of complex,multicellular soft tissue structures like livers, kidneys, and even hearts. There are now even a number of 3D cell printers commercially available that can create simple layer-wise formations of cells, primarily for testing and experimentalpurposes. A slightly more indirect approach that is more appropriate to the regeneration of bony tissue would be to create a scaffold from a biocompatible material thatrepresents the shape of the ﬁnal tissue construct and then add living cells at alater juncture. Scaffold geometry normally requires a porous structure with pores ofa few hundred microns across. This size permits good introduction and ingrowth of cells. A microporosity is often also desirable to permit the cells to insert ﬁbrils in order to attach ﬁrmly to the scaffold walls. Different materials and methods arecurrently under investigation, but normally such approaches use bioreactors toincubate the cells prior to implantation. Figure 19.5 shows a scaffold created for producing a mixture of bone and cartilage and then implanted into a rabbit [ 12]. The scaffold was a mixture of polycaprolactone (PCL) which acts as a matrix material,which is also biodegradable. Mixing tri-calcium phosphate (TCP) enhances thebiocompatibility with bone to encourage bone regeneration and also enhances the compressive modulus of the scaffold. Even with this approach, it is still a challenge to maintain the integrity of the scaffold for sufﬁcient lengths of time for healthy andstrong bone to form. While using this approach to create soft tissue structures orload-bearing bone is also some way from reality, some non-load-bearing boneconstructs have already been commercially proven [ 13]. 19.4 Software Support for Medical Applications There are a number of software tools available to assist users in preparing medical data for AM applications. Initially, such software concentrated on the translationfrom medical scanner systems and the creation of the standard STL ﬁles. Models made were generally replicas of the medical data. With the advent of the DICOM scanner standard, the translation tools became unnecessary and it became necessaryfor such systems to add value to the data in some way. The software systemstherefore evolved to include features where models could be manipulated andmeasured and where surgical procedures like jawbone resections could besimulated in order to determine locations for surgical implants. These have further19.4 Software Support for Medical Applications 461evolved to include software tools for inclusion of CAD data in order to design prosthetic devices or support for speciﬁc surgical procedures. Consider the application illustrated in Fig. 19.6 [14]. In this application, a prosthetic denture set is ﬁxed by drilling precisely into the jawbone so that posts can be placed for anchoring the dentures. A drill guide was developed using AM, positioning the drill holes precisely so that the orthodontist could drill in the correct location and at the correct angle. The software system allows the design of the drill guide to be created, based on the patient data taken from medical scans. AM models can also be used in the development of the prosthetic itself. Most CAD/CAM/CAE tools are used by engineers and other professionals who generally have good computer skills and an understanding of the basic principles of how such tools are constructed. Clinicians have very different backgrounds and their basic understanding is of biological and chemical sciences with a deep knowledge of human anatomy and biological construction. Computer tools must therefore focus on being able to manipulate the anatomical data without requiring too much knowledge of CAD, graphics, or engineering construction. Software support tools for AM-related applications should therefore provide a systematic solution where different aspects of the solution can be dealt with at various stages so that the digital data are maintained and used most effectively, like the application in Fig.19.6 where software and AM models were used at various stages to evaluate the case and to assist in the surgical procedure. Tissue engineering is where AM is heading in the medical arena, leading to direct manufacture of medical replacement parts. Software tools that deal with these applications are likely to be very different from conventional CAD/CAM tools. This is because the data are constructed in a different form. Medical data are almost by deﬁnition freeform. If it is to be accurately reproduced, then these models require large data ﬁles. In addition, the scaffolds to be created will be highly porous, with the pores in speciﬁc locations. STL ﬁles are likely to be somewhat useless in these applications, plus if the STL ﬁles included the pore architecture they would be inordinately large. Figure 19.5a for example, would normally be made using an Fig. 19.5 Hybrid scaffolds composed of two phases: ( a) Polycaprolactone (PCL) layer for cartilage tissue and bottom PCL/TCP (Tri-calcium phosphate) layer for bone. ( b–f) Implantation in a rabbit for 6 months revealed formation of subchondral bone in the PCL/TCP phase and cartilage-like tissue in PCL phase. Bar is 500 μmi n( b–d) and 200 μmi n( e) and ( f)462 19 Applications for Additive Manufactureextrusion process similar to FDM, where each cross-member of the scaffold would normally correspond to an extrusion road. It would be somewhat pointless for every cross-member to be described using STL, since the slices correspond to the thickness and location of these cross-member features. Most scaffold fabrication systems, like the 3D-Bioplotter from EnvisionTEC [ 15], shown in Fig. 19.7, include an operating system that includes a library of scaffold ﬁll geometries that include pore size and layer thickness rather than STL slicing systems. 19.5 Limitations of AM for Medical Applications Although there is no doubt that medical models are useful aids to solving complex surgical problems, there are numerous deﬁciencies in existing AM technologies related to their use to generate medical models. Part of the reason for this is because AM equipment was originally designed to solve problems in the more widespread area of manufactured product development and not speciﬁcally to solve medical problems. Development of the technology has therefore focused on improvements to solve the problems of manufacturers rather than those of doctors and surgeons. However, recent and future improvements in AM technology may open the doors to a much wider range of applications in the medical industry. Key issues that may change these deﬁciencies in favor of using AM include: Speed Cost Accuracy Materials Ease of use By analyzing these issues, we can determine which technologies may be most suitable for medical applications as well as how these technologies may develop in the future to better suit these applications. Fig. 19.6 Drill guides developed using AM-related software and machines19.5 Limitations of AM for Medical Applications 46319.5.1 Speed AM models can often take a day or even longer to fabricate. Since medical data needs to be segmented and processed according to anatomical features, the data preparation can in fact take much longer than the AM building time. Furthermore, this process of segmentation requires considerable skill and understanding of anatomy. This means that medical models can effectively only be included in surgical procedures that involve long-term planning and cannot be used, for exam- ple, as aids for rapid diagnosis and treatment in emergency operations. Many AM machines now have excellent throughput rate, both in terms of build speed and post-processing requirements. A few more iterations towards increasing this throughput could lead to these machines being used in outpatient clinics, at least for more effective diagnosis. However, it must be understood that this use must be in conjunction with improvements in supporting software for 3D model generation that reduces the skill requirements and increases the level of data processing automation. For tissue engineering applications, the time frames are a lot longer since we must wait for cells to proliferate and combine in the bioreactors. However, the sooner we can get to the stage of seeding scaffolds with cells, the better. 19.5.2 Cost Using AM models to solve manufacturing problems can help save millions of dollars for high-volume production, even if only a few cents are saved per unit. For the medical product (mass customization) manufacturing applications Fig. 19.7 The EnvisionTEC Bioplotter. Note the interchangeable extrusion head system and the extensive use of stainless steel in the fabrication464 19 Applications for Additive Manufacturementioned earlier, machine cost is not as important as perhaps some other factors. In comparison, the purpose of medical models for diagnosis, surgical planning, andprosthetic development is to optimize the surgeon’s planning time and to improve quality, effectiveness, and efﬁciency. These issues are more difﬁcult to quantify in terms of cost, but it is clear that only the more complex cases can easily justify theexpense of the models. The lower the machine, materials, and operating costs, themore suitable it will be for more medical models. Some machines are verycompetitively priced due to the use of low-cost, high-volume technologies, likeinkjet printing. Some other processes have lower-cost materials, but this relates toconsumable costs, which can also be reduced with increase of volume output. 19.5.3 Accuracy Many AM processes are being improved to create more accurate components.However, many medical applications currently do not require higher accuracybecause the data from the 3D imaging systems are considerably less accuratethan the AM machines they feed into. However, this does not mean that users in the medical ﬁeld should be complacent. As CT and MRI technologies become more accurate and sophisticated, so the requirements for AM will become more chal-lenging. Indeed some CT machines appear to have very good accuracy when usedproperly. Also, this generally relates to medical models for communication andplanning, but where devices are being manufactured the requirements for accuracywill be more stringent. Applications which require precise ﬁtting of implants arenow becoming commonplace. 19.5.4 Materials Only a few AM polymer materials are classiﬁed as safe for transport into theoperating theater and fewer still are capable of being placed inside the body.Those machines that provide the most suitable material properties are generallythe most expensive machines. Powder-based systems are also somewhat difﬁcult to implement due to potential contamination issues. This limits the range of applications for medical models. Many AM machine manufacturers now have arange of materials that are clinically approved for use in the operating theater. Metal systems, on the other hand, are being used regularly to produce implants using a range of technologies, as reported by Wohlers [ 16]. Of these, it appears that titanium is the preferred material, but Cobalt Chromium and Stainless Steel are bothavailable candidates that have the necessary biocompatibility for certainapplications.19.5 Limitations of AM for Medical Applications 46519.5.5 Ease of Use AM machines generally require a degree of technical expertise in order to achieve good quality models. This is particularly true of the larger, more complex, and more versatile machines. However, these larger machines are not particularly well suited to medical laboratory environments. Coupled with the software skills required fordata preparation, this implies a signiﬁcant training investment for any medicalestablishment wishing to use AM. While software is a problem that all AMtechnologies face, it doesn’t help that the machines themselves often have complexsetup options, materials handling, and general maintenance requirements. 19.6 Further Development of Medical AM Applications It is difﬁcult to say whether a particular AM technology is more or less suited tomedical applications. This is because there are numerous ways in which thesemachines may be applied in this ﬁeld. One can envisage that different technologiesmay ﬁnd their way into different medical departments due the speciﬁc beneﬁts they provide. However, the most common commercial machines certainly seem to be well suited to being used as communication aids between surgeons, technical staff,and patients. Models can also be suitable for diagnostic aids and can assist inplanning, the development of surgical procedures, and for creating surgical toolsand even the prosthetics themselves. Direct fabrication of implants and prostheticsis however limited to the direct metal AM technologies that can produce parts usingFDA (The US Food and Drug Administration) certiﬁed materials plus the smallnumber of technologies that are capable of non-load-bearing polymer scaffolds. For more of these technologies to be properly accepted in the medical arena, a number of factors must be addressed by the industry: Approvals Insurance• Engineering training• Location of the technology 19.6.1 Approvals While a number of materials are now accepted by the FDA for use in medicalapplications, there are still questions regarding the best procedures for generating models. Little is known about the materials and processes outside of the mainstream AM industry. Approval and certiﬁcation of materials and processes through ASTMwill certainly help to pave the way towards FDA approval, but this can be a verylong and laborious process. Those (relatively few) surgeons who are aware of the processes seem to achieve excellent results and are able to present numerous successful case studies. However,466 19 Applications for Additive Manufacturethe medical industry is (understandably) very conservative about the introduction of these new technologies. Surgeons who wish to use AM generally have to resort tocreative approaches based on trusting patients who sign waivers, the use of com- mercial AM service companies, and word of mouth promotion. Hospitals and health authorities still do not have procedures for purchase of AM technology in the sameway they might purchase a CT machine. 19.6.2 Insurance Many hospitals around the world treat patients according to their level of insurancecoverage. Similar to the aforementioned issue of approvals, insurance companiesdo not generally have any protocols for coverage using AM as a stage in thetreatment process. It may be possible for some schemes to justify AM parts basedon the recommendations of a surgeon, but some companies may question thepurpose of the models, requiring additional paperwork that may deter somesurgeons from adopting that route. Again, this issue may be solvable through a process of legitimizing the industry. In the past, AM was considered as a technology suitable mainly for prototypes in the early phases of product development. As we move more and more into main-stream manufacturing, the industry and consumers become more demanding. Partof the satisfying of this demand is the certiﬁcation process. Insurance companies arealso more likely to accept these technologies as part of the treatment process if thereare effective quality control mechanisms in place. Also, the increasing number ofsuccessful applications using metal systems may lead to the polymer-basedmachines also becoming more acceptable. 19.6.3 Engineering Training Creating AM models requires skills that many surgeons and technicians will notpossess. While many of the newer, low-cost machines do not require signiﬁcantskill to operate, preparation of the ﬁles and some post-processing requirements may require more ability. The most likely skills required for the software-based processing can be found in radiology departments since the operations for prepara-tion of a software model are similar to manipulation and interpretation of CT andMRI models. However, technicians in this area are not used to building andmanipulating physical models. These skills can however be found in prostheticsand orthotics departments. It is generally quite unusual to ﬁnd radiology veryclosely linked with orthotics and prosthetics. The required skills are, therefore,distributed throughout a typical hospital.19.6 Further Development of Medical AM Applications 46719.6.4 Location of the Technology AM machines could be located in numerous medical departments. The most likely would be to place them either in a laboratory where prosthetics are produced, or in a specialist medical imaging center. If placed in the laboratories, the manual skills will be present but the accessibility will be low. If placed in imaging centers, theaccessibility will be high but the applications will probably be conﬁned to visuali-zation rather than fabrication of medical devices. Fortunately, most hospitals arenow well equipped with high-speed intranets where patient data can be accessedquickly and easily. A separate facility that links closely to the patient data networkand one that has skilled software and modeling technicians for image processingand for model post-processing (and associated downstream activities) may be a preference. 19.6.5 Service Bureaus It can be seen that most of the hurdles for AM adoption are essentially procedural in nature rather than technical. A concerted effort to convince the medical industry ofthe value of AM models for general treatment purposes is, therefore, a keyadvancement that will provide a way forward. There are small but increasing number of companies developing excellent reputations by specializing in producing models for the medical industry.Companies like Medical Modelling LLC [ 7] and Anatomics [ 17] have been in business for a number of years, not just creating models for surgeons but assisting in the development of new medical products. These service bureaus ﬁll the skill gap between the medics and the manufacturers. At the moment, this technology is notwell understood in the medical industry and it may be some time before it can beproperly assimilated. Eventually, AM technology will become better suited to awider range of medical applications and at this point, the hospitals and clinics mayhave their own machines with the inbuilt skills to use them properly. Furthermore,the large medical product manufacturers will also see the beneﬁts of this technologyin product development and DDM. As the technology becomes cheaper, easier to use and better suited to the application, such support companies may no longer be necessary to support the industry. This is something the AM industry has seen inother application sectors. In the meantime, these companies provide a vital role insupporting the industry from both sides. 19.7 Aerospace Applications As mentioned, aerospace is another industry that has traditionally applied AM sinceit was introduced. The primary advantage for production applications in aerospaceis the ability to generate complex engineered geometries with a limited number ofprocessing steps. Aerospace companies have access to budgets signiﬁcantly larger468 19 Applications for Additive Manufacturethan most industries. This is, however, often necessary because of the high perfor- mance nature of the products being produced. 19.7.1 Characteristics Favoring AM Signiﬁcant advantages could be realized if aerospace components were improvedwith respect to one or more of these characteristics: Lightweight : Anything that ﬂies requires energy to get it off the ground. The lighter the component, the less energy is required. This can be achieved by use oflightweight materials, with high strength to weight ratio. Titanium and aluminumhave traditionally been materials of choice because of this. More recently carbonﬁber reinforced composites have gained popularity. However, it is also possible to address this issue by creating lightweight structures with hollow or honeycomb internal cores. This kind of topology optimization is quite easy to achieveusing AM. High temperature : Both aircraft and spacecraft are subject to high-temperature variations, with extremes in both high and low temperatures. Engine componentsare subject to very high temperatures where innovative cooling solutions are oftenemployed. Even internal components are required to be made from ﬂame retardantmaterials. This means that AM generally requires its materials to be specially tailored to suit aerospace applications. Complex geometry : Aerospace applications can often require components to have more than one function. For example, a structural component may also actas a conduit or an engine turbine blade may also have an internal structure forpassing coolant through it. Furthermore, geometric speciﬁcations for parts may bedetermined by complex mathematical formulae based on ﬂuid ﬂow, etc. Economics : AM enables economical low production volumes, which are com- mon in aerospace, since hard tooling is not needed. Designers and manufacturing engineers need not design and fabricate molds, dies, or ﬁxtures, or spend time on complex process planning (e.g., for machining) that conventional manufacturingprocesses require. Digital spare parts : Many aircraft have very long useful lives (20–50 years or longer) which places a burden on the manufacturer to provide spare parts. Instead ofwarehousing spares, or maintaining manufacturing tooling, over the aircraft’s longlife, the usage of AM enables companies to maintain digital models of parts. Thiscan be much easier and less expensive than warehousing physical parts or tools. 19.7.2 Production Manufacture All of the major aerospace companies in the USA and Europe have pursuedproduction applications of AM for many years. Boeing, for example, has installedtens of thousands of AM parts on their military and commercial aircraft. Report-edly, over 200 different parts are ﬂying on at least 16 models of aircraft [ 18]. Until19.7 Aerospace Applications 469recently, all of these were nonstructural polymer parts for military or space applications. For commercial aircraft, polymer parts need to satisfy ﬂammabilityrequirements, so their adoption needed to wait until ﬂame retardant polymer PBF materials were developed. For metals, material qualiﬁcation and part certiﬁcation took many years to achieve. In addition to parts manufacturing, aerospacecompanies are also developing new higher-performance materials in both metalsand polymers, as well as processing methods. Some of the ﬁrst large scale, metal part production manufacturing applications are emerging in the aerospace industry. GE purchased Morris Technologies in 2012as part of a major investment in metal AM for the production of gas turbine enginecomponents. The part that has received the most attention is a new fuel nozzle design for the CFM LEAP (Leading Edge Aviation Propulsion) turbofan engine, as shown in Fig. 19.8 [19]. The new fuel nozzle took the part consolidation concept to new levels by reportedly combining 18–20 parts into one integrated design andavoiding many brazed joints and assembly operations. This new design is projectedto have a useful life ﬁve times that of the original design, a 25 % weight reduction,and additional cost savings realized through optimizing the design and productionprocess. Additionally, the fuel nozzle was engineered to reduce carbon build up,making the nozzle more efﬁcient. Production manufacturing of the nozzles is scheduled to begin in 2015. Each engine contains 19 fuel nozzles and more than 4,500 engines have been sold to date,so production volume could exceed 100,000 total parts by 2020. This is claimed tosave 1000 lb of weight out of each engine. The nozzles are fabricated using thecobalt-chrome material fabricated in EOS metal PBF machines. Parts are likely tobe stress relieved while still in the powder bed, followed by hot isostatic pressing(HIP) to ensure that the parts are fully dense. An in-process inspection technologywas developed jointly between GE Aviation and Sigma Labs for use in the EOS machines. Called PrintRite3D, the technology is used to inspect and verify metal parts while they are being fabricated. It consists of software for closed-loop controland data analysis to determine if parts are within speciﬁcation, along with a set ofsensors to that allow a controlled weld pool volume. The company claims that theirtechnology enables the control of an alloy’s microstructure by controlling thetemperature history throughout the part. Several metal PBF vendors offer a variety of titanium alloy materials for use on their machines. One recent development is a variant of titanium called Ti–6Al–4V ELI, which denotes a titanium alloy with about 6 % aluminum, 4 % vanadium, and Extra Low Interstitials (ELI), meaning the alloy has lower speciﬁed limits on ironand interstitial elements carbon and oxygen. The ELI variant has better corrosionresistance and mechanical properties, particularly at cryogenic temperatures, thanstandard Ti–6Al–4V. Due to these properties, the alloy has excellent biocompati-bility and is of great interest in the medical industry. Its light weight, high strength,and high toughness properties mean that it is a good candidate for aerospaceapplications, as well. A recent ASTM standard addresses speciﬁcations for metal PBF parts fabricated from this alloy.470 19 Applications for Additive ManufactureAs another example, Airbus has developed a second-generation aluminum- magnesium-scandium alloy, called ScalmalloyRP, for metal PBF processes. Thematerial reportedly has mechanical properties that are twice as good as commer- cially available aluminum alloys, with high corrosion resistance and good fatigue properties [ 18]. Early efforts towards production manufacturing with polymer PBF systems were performed at Boeing. In 2002, a Boeing spin-off company, On DemandManufacturing, was formed. Their ﬁrst application was to manufacture environ-mental control system ducts to deliver cooling air to electronics instruments on F-18military jets. They rebuilt several SLS Sinterstation machines in order to ensure thatthey could fabricate these parts reliably and repeatably. ODM was purchased by RMB Products, Inc., in 2005 but continues operations today. Airbus investigated topology optimization applications in order to develop part designs that were signiﬁcantly lighter than those suitable for conventionalmanufacturing processes. Shown in Fig. 19.9 is an A320 nacelle hinge bracket that was originally designed as a cast steel part, but was redesigned to be fabricatedin a titanium alloy using PBF [ 20]. Reportedly, they trimmed 10 kg off the mass of the bracket, saving approximately 40 % in weight. This study was performed as partof a larger effort to compare life-cycle environmental impacts of part design. Many more production applications of AM can be expected in the near future as materials improve and production methods become standardized, repeatable, andcertiﬁed. New design concepts can be expected, such as the A320 hinge bracket, for Fig. 19.8 GE Aviation fuel nozzle19.7 Aerospace Applications 471not only piece parts, but entire modules. AM vendors are developing larger frame machines so that larger parts can be fabricated, opening up new opportunities forstructural metal components and functional polymer parts. 19.8 Automotive Applications As mentioned, the automotive industry was one of the early adopters of AM andpersonnel at these companies pioneered many types of AM applications in productdevelopment. Companies in this industry continue to be heavy users of AM,accounting for approximately 17 % of all expenditures on AM in 2013. Thispositions the automotive industry behind only industrial/business machines(18.5 %) and consumer products/electronics (18 %), which are very large andbroad industries in terms of the largest users of AM. Since production volumes in the automotive industry are often high (100,000s per year), AM has typically been evaluated as too expensive for production manufacturing, in contrast to the aerospace industry. To date, most manufacturershave not committed to AM parts on their mass-produced car models. However,there have been niche applications of AM that are worth exploring. As mentioned in the Historical Developments section, a variety of rapid prototyping applications were developed by automotive companies and theirsuppliers. In addition to RP and rapid tooling, suppliers to this industry used AMparts to debug their assembly lines. That is, they used AM parts to test assembly operations and tooling to identify potential problems before production assembly commenced. Since model line change-over involves huge investments, being ableto avoid problems in production yielded very large savings. Fig. 19.9 A320 hinge bracket redesigned for AM. Courtesy EOS GmbH472 19 Applications for Additive ManufactureIn the metal PBF area, Concept Laser, a German company, introduced their X line 1000R machine recently, which has a build chamber large enough to accom-modate a V6 automotive engine block. This machine was developed in collabora- tion with Daimler AG. It is not clear if they intend their automotive customers to fabricate production engine blocks in this machine, but they claim the machine wasdeveloped with production manufacture in mind. According to Concept Laser, the1000R is capable of building at a rate of 65 cm 3per hour, which is fast compared to some other metal PBF machines. Additionally, the machine was designed with twobuild boxes (powder chambers) on a single turntable so that one build box could beused for part fabrication, while the other could be undergoing cool-down, partremoval, pre-heating or other non-part-building activities. For specialty cars or low-volume production, AM can be economical for some parts. Applications include custom parts on luxury cars or replacement parts onantique cars. The example of Bentley Motors was given in Chap. 17. Polymer PBF was used to fabricate some custom interior components, such as bezels, that weresubsequently covered in leather and other materials. Typically, Bentley has pro-duction volumes of less than 10,000 cars for a given model, so this qualiﬁes as lowproduction volume. Local Motors is a small company that is experimenting with crowdsourcing and other novel methods of new vehicle development. They participated in the DARPA FANG military vehicle development exercise, for example. They utilize AM whenit makes sense for their applications. In a separate initiative, they conducted acrowd-sourced car design project, with the requirement that the majority of the carwould be fabricated by AM. They plan to fabricate the body and structuralcomponents using a new, large-frame material extrusion machine from OakRidge National Laboratories at the International Machine Technology Show inSeptember 2014. Among the racing organizations, Formula 1 has been a leader in adopting AM. Originally using AM for rapid prototyping, some of the teams started puttingAM parts on their race cars in the early to mid-2000s. These were typicallynonstructural polymer PBF parts. Similarly to the aerospace industry, Formula1 teams utilized AM models for wind tunnel testing of scale models, as well asparts for full size car models. Teams from other racing organizations, includingIndy and NASCAR, have also made AM an integral aspect of their car developmentprocess. 19.9 Exercises How does Computerized Tomography actually generate 3D images?

These locations can decrease even further when companiesoff-shore product development, production, and/or distribution to othercountries/companies to take advantage of lower resource, labor or overhead costs. The resulting concentration of employment leads to regions of dispropor- tionately high underemployment and/or unemployment. As a result, nations canhave regions of underpopulation with consequent national problems such asinfrastructure being underutilized, and long-term territorial integrity beingcompromised (Beale, Rural Cond Trends 11(2):27–31, 2000). 20.1 Introduction The current approach for many manufacturing enterprises is to centralize productdevelopment, product production, and product distribution in a relatively fewphysical locations. These locations can decrease even further when companiesoffshore product development, production, and/or distribution to other countries/companies to take advantage of lower resource, labor or overhead costs. The resulting concentration of employment leads to regions of disproportionately high underemployment and/or unemployment. As a result, nations can have regions ofunderpopulation with consequent national problems such as infrastructure beingunderutilized, and long-term territorial integrity being compromised [ 1]. Because of recent developments in additive manufacturing, as described in this book, there is no fundamental reason for products to be brought to markets throughcentralized development, production, and distribution. Instead, products can bebrought to markets through product conceptualization, product creation, and prod- uct propagation being carried out by individuals and communities in any geograph- ical region. #Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015 I. Gibson et al., Additive Manufacturing Technologies , DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-2113-3_20475In this chapter, conceptualization means the forming and relating of ideas, including the formation of digital versions of these ideas (e.g., CAD); creation means bringing an idea into physical existence (e.g., by manufacturing a compo- nent); and propagation means multiplying by reproduction through digital means (e.g., through digital social networks) or through physical means (e.g., bydistributed AM production). Many companies already use the Internet to collect product ideas from ordinary people from diverse locations. However, these companies are feeding these ideasinto the centralized physical locations of their existing business operations fordetailed design and creation. Distributed conceptualization, creation, and propaga-tion can supersede concentrated development, production, and distribution by combining AM with novel human/digital interfaces which, for instance, enable non-experts to create and modify shapes. Additionally, body/place/part scanningcan be used to collect data about physical features for input into digitally enableddesign software and onward to AM. Web 2.0 is considered as the second generation of the Internet, where users can interact with and transform web content. The advent of the Internet allowed any organization, such as a newspaper publisher, to deliver information and content toanyone in the world. More recently, however, social networking sites such as Facebook, or auction web sites such as eBay, enable consumers of web content to also be content creators. These, and most new web sites today, fall within the scopeof Web 2.0. AM makes it possible for digital designs to be transformed into physical products at that same location or any other location in the world (i.e., “designanywhere, build anywhere”). Moreover, the web tools associated with Web 2.0 areperfect for the propagation of product ideas and component designs that can becreated through AM. The combination of Web 2.0 with AM can lead to new models of entrepreneurship. Distributed conceptualization and propagation of digital content is known as digital entrepreneurship. However, the exploitation of AM to enable distributedcreation of physical products goes beyond just digital entrepreneurship. Accord-ingly, the term, digiproneurship was coined to distinguish distributed conceptuali- zation, propagation, and creation of physical products from distributed conceptualization and propagation of just digital content. Thus digiproneurship isfocused on transforming digital data into physical products using an entrepre neur- ship business model. Short deﬁnitions of the terms introduced in this section are summarized in Fig. 20.1. Web 2.0 + AM has the potential to generate distributed, sustainable employment that is not vulnerable to off-shoring. This form of employment is not vulnerable tooff-shoring because it is based on distributed networks in which resource costs arenot a major proportion of total costs. Employment that is generated is environmen-tally friendly because, for example, it involves much lower energy consumptionthan the established concentration of product development, production, and distri- bution, which often involves shipping of products worldwide from centralized locations.476 20 Business Opportunities and Future DirectionsAs discussed throughout this book (particularly in Chaps. 17,18and 20), developments in AM offer possibilities for new types of products. Thus, there aremany potential markets for the outputs of digiproneurship. 20.2 What Could Be New? 20.2.1 New Types of Products Developments in AM, together with developments in advanced Information andCommunication Technologies (aICT), such as more intuitive human interfaces for design, Web 2.0, and digital scanning, are making it possible for person-speciﬁc/ location-speciﬁc and/or event-speciﬁc products to be created much more quicklyand at much lower cost. These products can have superior characteristics comparedto products created through conventional methods. In particular, AM can enablepreviously intractable trade-offs to be overcome. For example, design trade-offssuch as manufacturing complexity versus assembly costs can be overcome (e.g.,geometrically complex products can now be produced as one piece rather thanhaving to be assembled from several pieces); material selection trade-offs such as performance requirements versus microstructures can be overcome (e.g., turbine blades can now have both high strength and high thermal performance in differentlocations); economic trade-offs such as person-speciﬁc ﬁt and/or functionalityversus production time and/or cost can be overcome (e.g., customized prosthetics,such as hearing aids with person-speciﬁc ﬁt, can be produced rapidly). When utilizing an additive approach to production, the consumption of non-value adding resources can be radically reduced during the creation of physicalgoods. Further, the amount of factory equipment needed and, therefore, factory space needed is reduced. As a result, opportunities for smaller, distributed (even mobile) production facilities increase. Some examples are provided in Table 20.1. Perhaps most importantly, the potential for radically reducing the size of productionfacilities enables production at point-of-demand. Although digiproneurship is probably best enabled by AM, any digitally driven technology which directly transforms digital information into a physical good can Fig. 20.1 Deﬁnition of terms20.2 What Could Be New? 477fall within the scope of digiproneurship. This can include the fabrication of structures which enclose space (such as for housing) whereby each individualpiece could be created using a digitally driven cutting operation and then assembledat the point of need into a usable dwelling. It is very important to note that the limitations of manufacturing equipment and the need for expert knowledge of microstructures and material performance havepreviously restricted the value of direct consumer control over content. Thus, most examples of consumer-produced content are for nonphysical products [ 2]. For example, a person who reads a newspaper (consumer of the newspaper) walksdown a street and sees something newsworthy. The person takes a photograph ofit. The person sends the image to the newspaper. The photograph is included in thenewspaper, and hence the person becomes a partial producer of what they consume.While such forms of consumer input are established, it is only recently thatdevelopments in aICT and AM make possible consumer input into a wide rangeof physical goods. From an engineering and design standpoint, AM technologies are becoming more accurate, they can directly build small products (micron-sized) and very largeproducts (building-sized). New materials have been developed for these processes,and new approaches to AM are being introduced into the marketplace. From abusiness-strategies standpoint, AM technologies are becoming faster, cheaper,safer, more reliable, and environmentally friendly. As each of these advancementsbecomes available within the marketplace, new categories of physical goodsbecome competitive for production using AM versus conventional manufacturing. Combination of aICT with AM thus offers a wide range of opportunities for innovation in products and product services. Opportunities exist for individuals(e.g., at home), B2B (Business to Business), and B2C (Business to Consumer).Further, opportunities exist for creation of designs or creation of physicalcomponents. Thus a digiproneur could be someone who: (1) creates digital toolsfor use by consumers or other digiproneurs; (2) creates designs which are bought byconsumers or businesses; (3) creates physical products from digital data; or(4) licenses or operates enabling software or machinery in support of digiproneurship. By replacing concentrated product development, production, and distribution with distributed product conceptualization, creation, and propagation it is possibleTable 20.1 Radical reductions in the consumption of non-value adding resources Example First order effect Second order effect No need for molds/diesLess material consumption Lower start-up costs Fewer parts to join Less joining equipment Less capital tied up in infrastructure Fewer parts to assembleLess labor and less assembly equipmentNo need to off-shore production to low labor cost markets No spare parts are stockedLess storage space Reduced factory and warehousing size478 20 Business Opportunities and Future Directionsfor individuals or communities to bring products to different types of consumers without needing to make large investment in market research, design facilities,production facilities, or distribution networks. The reasons for this are further explained in the following subsection. 20.2.2 New Types of Organizations Web 2.0 technologies have spawned a convergence of traditional craft with technologies. One need only attend a local Maker Faire to see the gamut ofentrepreneurs offering products made traditionally, with lots of electronics, andwith AM content. To support the emerging communities of craftsmen and women,online portals, blogs, and repositories have proliferated. For example, some portalshave been established to focus on 3D Printing ( www.3ders.org ) or more broadly on making ( www.instructables.com ). The number of blogs focused on 3D Printing, AM, and making is too numerous to do justice by listing only one or two. Since the creation of 3D digital content can be challenging several repositories of 3D contenthave been created, the most well-known being Thingiverse ( www.thingiverse. com). Even traditional craft-based media have changed with, for example, Make Magazine adopting a synergistic combination of traditional paper distribution withonline content and interaction. Each of these examples represents a business entitythat was created by an entrepreneur who wanted to leverage Web 2.0 and add valueto AM users, companies, or communities. In traditional manufacturing industries, companies such as MFG.com have become very success as industry matchmakers, ﬁnding suppliers or customers forcompanies around the world. They provide services for establishing supply chainsand handling logistics for companies. Their expansion into the AM ﬁeld seemsinevitable and may already have begun. This may cause existing service bureausadapt their business models. They can join existing networks of parts suppliers orpossibly try to build their own networks. They could choose to concentrate on theirtechnology (within AM) or become more consumer focused, possibly becoming a supplier to a virtual storefront company. From a different perspective, companies can utilize Web 2.0 technologies to engage with their customers to a much greater extent. Customer co-design andcrowdsourcing are new terms that relate to this customer focus. Some consumercompanies, such as Nike, Dell, and Home Depot, have been pioneers in providingweb-based tools that enable customers to conﬁgure their own products. We canexpect this trend to continue to grow exponentially. New opportunities will emergefor unprecedented levels of customer engagement. We are seeing new companies created to provide customer-designed products, for example sunglasses, that are fabricated locally using AM. One could image kiosks at local shopping malls thatare equipped with 3D printers for near real-time fabrication. The Local Motors crowdsourcing example has been mentioned in earlier chapters. They have been an early adopter of crowdsourcing for automotivevehicles. Many other organizations and companies are experimenting with20.2 What Could Be New? 479crowdsourcing technologies and practices for the development of products. It will be interesting to see how a highly technical and integrated product (such as a car)can be developed by hundreds of geographically dispersed individuals who are contributing informally on irregular schedules. From marketing and decision- making perspectives, however, having all of these individuals critique and voteon design alternatives and become invested in the outcome of the group activity canhave tremendous beneﬁts in terms of sales. Products may become successful simplybecause they “went viral” due to high levels of involvement from vocal onlinecommunities. Going beyond Web 2.0 technologies, the area of cloud computing has enabled the emergence of cloud-based design and manufacturing (CBDM) concepts. We are already seeing mechanical CAD companies, such as Dassault Systemes and AutoDesk, offer cloud-based CAD and engineering systems. Some companies aretalking about cloud-based AM part fabrication services. CBDM represents a naturalevolution of this trend. One challenge for cloud-based manufacturing is the need forhard tooling for part manufacture and product assembly. It is difﬁcult to provideﬂexible, scalable, “produce anywhere” services if one has to ﬁrst fabricate a lot oftooling. On the other hand, AM offers a ﬂexible, scalable, “produce anywhere”solution for CBDM. It is likely that we will see CBD products and services incorporate some CBM aspects. Perhaps an obvious ﬁrst step is a “3D Print” button in cloud-based CAD systems. A longer term possibility is a convergence betweencloud-based CAD and supply chain service providers (e.g., MFG.com) so thatengineering designers can include manufacturing, vendor, and supply chainconsequences of design decisions quickly in a seamless online environment. 20.2.3 New Types of Employment As summarized in Table 20.1, innovative combinations of AM and aICT help eliminate non-value adding consumption of resources and reduce energy consump-tion arising from transportation of ﬁnished goods. Creation of physical products at point-of-demand can overturn current comparative disadvantages in the creation of physical products for global markets. As an example, today Finland has thecomparative disadvantages of limited natural resources, far distance from mass markets, and relatively high labor costs. However, aICT + AM has the potential tomake Finland’s comparative disadvantages become unimportant in global value networks. This is because centralized models of physical production can bereplaced by distributed models of value creation. In distributed models, designcan take place anywhere in the world, and production can take place anywhere else in the world. As a result, there are opportunities for many jobs to be created in Finland by meeting “derived demand” for the software, hardware, and consultancyneeded by creation organizations in other parts of the world. This is in addition tothe jobs that can be created in Finland by meeting “primary demand” for physicalgoods which are used in Finland, Russia, Nordic regions, and beyond; or uniquedesigns which can be electronically delivered to consumers worldwide for their480 20 Business Opportunities and Future Directionscreation. Thus, the resources that become important in digiproneurship are creativ- ity, technological savvy, and access to digiproneurship networks. Innovative combinations of AM and aICT make it possible for creation of diverse product types by people without prior knowledge of design and/or produc- tion. Regions of persistent unemployment could be reduced by enabling a dynamicnetwork of aICT + AM micro-businesses and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises(SMEs). These could be distributed among local individuals working from theirhomes, from their garages, from their small workshops, or from light industrialpremises. They could be distributed among families and communities that have agenerational investment and an abiding commitment to the regions in which theylive. Accordingly, the jobs generated by digiproneurship are resistant to concentra- tion and outsourcing. The labor cost component of aICT + AM products is relatively low. Thus, these combinations of high technology and low labor input mean that there is littleincentive to outsource to low labor cost economies. A summary is provided inTable 20.2 of the factors that can enable overturning of regional disadvantages which might occur in the creation of physical products for global markets. A diverse range of people and businesses could offer products via digiproneurship. Some examples of these people and business are:  Artistic individuals who want to create unique physical goods  Hobby enthusiasts who understand niche market needs IT savvy people who are interested in developing novel aICT software tools Farmers wanting to diversify beyond offering B&B to the occasional tourist Under-employed persons looking to provide supplemental income for their families  Unemployed people who are reluctant to uproot to major cities to look for work  Machine shops wanting to diversify and/or better utilize their skilled workforce  SMEs that want to introduce more customer-speciﬁc versions of their product offerings  Multinational corporations seeking to streamline the design and supply of goods which will be integrated into their products Thus, digiproneurship represents the intersection of conceptualization, creation, and propagation, as illustrated in Fig. 20.2. 20.3 Digiproneurship Entrepreneurship involves individuals starting new enterprises or breathing new energy into mature enterprises through the introduction of new ideas. Entrepreneur-ship is associated with uncertainty because it involves introducing a new idea[3]. Well-known examples of digital entrepreneurship include Facebook, Google, and YouTube. By taking digital entrepreneurship one step further, into the creationof physical goods, digiproneurship represents the next logical step.20.3 Digiproneurship 481Distributed conceptualization and propagation can reduce the risks traditionally associated with entrepreneurship. In particular, digitally enabled conceptualization and propagation of new concepts and designs for physical products can eliminatethe need for costly conventional market research. Further, digitally enabled propa-gation of product designs to point-of-demand AM facilities can eliminate the needfor physical distribution facilities such as large warehouses, costly tooling such asinjection molds, and difﬁcult to manage distribution networks. Together, digitallyenabled conceptualization, propagation, and creation can eliminate many of theuncertainties and up-front expenses that have traditionally caused many entrepre- neurial ventures to fail. Digiproneurship transcends traditional design paradigms by facilitating the emergence of enterprise through the self-expression of personal feelings andopinions. New digital interfaces which enable non-experts to capture their designintent as physically producible designs could radically transform the way productsare conceived and produced. One of the earliest enterprises that could be considered a digiproneurship enterprise was Freedom of Creation ( www.freedomofcreation.com ), as discussed in Chap. 20. Subsequently to Freedom of Creation, numerous other digiproneurship activities have been started, including FigurePrints ( www.ﬁgureprints.com ) for creation of World of Warcraft ﬁgures and virtual storefronts such as ShapewaysTable 20.2 Overturning regional disadvantages in the creation of physical products Typical location-based disadvantages aICT + AM potential Lack of natural resources Products make use of relatively small quantities of high-quality engineered materials procurable worldwide High labor costs Labor content is smaller, but networking and technology integration content is higher Distance from markets aICT + AM products can be designed anywhere, propagated digitally and produced at the point-of-need. Shipping costs are minimized Fig. 20.2 Digiproneurship involves the creation of abusiness enterprise by connecting conceptualization, propagation, and/or creation482 20 Business Opportunities and Future Directions(www.shapeways.com ) and Ponoko ( www.ponoko.com ), which are online communities where digiproneurs can sell designs, services, and products. Digiproneurship opportunities are now being considered early in the conceptu- alization stage for new products. The Spore game and Spore Creature Creator (www.spore.com ) were designed such that Spore creatures, created by the game players, are represented by 3D digital data that can be transferred to an AM machinefor direct printing using a color binder jetting process. This is unlike the originalWorld of Warcraft ﬁgures, which appear 3D on-screen but are not 3D solid models;and thus require data manipulation in order to prepare the ﬁgure for AM. SporeSculptor (sporesculptor.com) has been set up as a portal for Spore game users topurchase physical representations of their Spore creatures. In the future, inexpensive, intuitive solid modeling tools, such as Google SketchUp (sketchup.google.com), may be used widely by consumers to designtheir own products. For many products, safety or intellectual property concernswill likely lead to software which will enable consumers to modify products withinexpert-deﬁned constraints so that consumers can directly make meaningful changesto products while maintaining safety or other features that are necessary in theend-product. The success of digiproneurship enterprises is due to their recognition of market needs which can be fulﬁlled by imaginative product offerings enabled through innovative combinations of aICT and AM. Although pioneers have demonstratedthat successful enterprises can be established, the potential for digiproneurshipextends signiﬁcantly beyond the scope of today’s technological capabilities andbusiness networks. In particular, as aICT and AM progress, and new businessnetworks are established, the opportunities for successful digiproneurship willexpand. Several research and development priorities for aICT and AM are crucial for further realization of digiproneurship: Digiproneurship-related research and development priorities for aICT  Development of geometric manipulation tools with intuitively understandable interfaces which can be used readily by non-experts.  Application of expert-deﬁned constraints (such as through shape grammars and computational semantics) to enable experts to create versatile parameters fordigiproneurship products. These parameters conform to criteria for, e.g., safety and brand, but facilitate the creation of person-speciﬁc, location-speciﬁc, and/or event-speciﬁc versions by non-experts.  Web-based digiproneurship tools which can enable non-experts to set up and operate their own digitally driven enterprise. These web-based tools encompassmarket opportunities and business issues; as well as technology characteristicsand material properties.  Additional web-based digiproneurship tools to assist in setting up virtual enterprises that integrate supplier identiﬁcation, supply chain conﬁguration, marketing, and product delivery.20.3 Digiproneurship 483Digiproneurship research and development priorities for AM  Continuing the current trend to lower-cost equipment and materials  Automating and minimizing post-processing of products after production, so that parts can go directly from a machine to the end customer with little or nohuman interaction  Continuing the current trend to increasing diversiﬁcation of machine sizes, speeds and accuracies  Interfaces to automatically convert multimaterial and multicolor user-speciﬁed requirements directly into digital manufacturing instructions without humanintervention As digiproneurship matures, there will be a need for an increasing number of creation facilities that enable digiproneurs to reach customers irrespective of theirlocation. Some of these creation facilities will be the 3D corollary to today’s localcopy centers. As such, they may even offer AM alongside 2D printers. Further,companies in all sectors may lease AM equipment in the same way that they leasedocument printers today. AM creation facilities could be located within departmentstores (e.g., for customer-speciﬁc exclusive goods such as jewelry); large hospitals (e.g., for patient-speciﬁc prosthetics); home improvement stores (e.g., for family- speciﬁc furnishings); and/or industrial wholesalers (e.g., for plant-speciﬁc upgradeﬁttings). Competition and cooperation among creation facilities that provideservices to digiproneurs will be enabled by aICT. Those who establish thesecreation facilities will themselves be digiproneurs and aid other digiproneurs increating physical products. Development of digiproneurship infrastructure will leadto an increasing ability by digiproneurs to conceptualize, create, and propagatecompetitive new products, resulting in a sustainable model for distributed employ- ment wherever digiproneurship is embraced. This, then, will be “Factory 2.0.” As Web 2.0 has seen the move from static web pages to dynamic and shareablecontent; Factory 2.0 will see the move from static factories to dynamic andshareable creation. To make this possible, Factory 2.0 will draw upon Web 2.0and the distributed conceptualization and propagation which it and AM enables. Since the advent of the industrial revolution, the creation of physical goods has become an ever more specialized domain requiring extensive knowledge andinvestment. This type of highly concentrated and meticulously planned factory production will continue. However, Factory 2.0 will likely ﬂourish alongside it. This will enable production by consumers, as envisioned 40 years ago[4]. Thus, the innate potential of people to create physical goods will be realized by fulﬁlling the latent potential of Web 2.0 combined with AM in ever moreimaginative ways. Additionally, for the ﬁrst time since the industrial revolutionbegan, the trends towards increasing urbanization to support increasinglycentralized production may begin to reverse when the opportunities afforded byFactory 2.0 are fully realized.484 20 Business Opportunities and Future DirectionsConclusions There is no longer any fundamental reason for products to be brought to markets through centralized product development, production, and distribution. Instead, products can be brought to markets through product conceptualization, creation,and propagation in any geographical region. This form of digiproneurship isbuilt around combinations of aICT and advanced manufacturing technologies. Digiproneurship offers many opportunities for a reduction in the consumption of non-value adding resources during the creation of physical goods. Further, theamount of factory equipment needed and, therefore, factory space is reduced. Asa result, opportunities for smaller, distributed, and mobile production facilities will increase. Digiproneurship can eliminate the need for costly conventional market research, large warehouses, distribution centers, and large capitalinvestments in infrastructure and tooling. Creation of physical products at point-of-demand can make regional disadvantages unimportant. A wide range of people and businesses could offerdigiproneurship products, including artists, hobby enthusiasts, IT savvyprogrammers, underemployed and unemployed people who are reluctant touproot to major cities to look for work, and others. Novel combinations of aICT and AM have already made it possible for enterprises to be established based on digitally driven conceptualization, crea-tion, and/or propagation. The success of these existing enterprises is due to theirrecognition of market needs which can be fulﬁlled by imaginative, digitallyenabled product offerings. As aICT and AM progress, and new creationnetworks are established, CBDM will become a reality, the opportunities forsuccessful digiproneurship will expand and Factory 2.0 will come into being. As digiproneurship expands and Factory 2.0 becomes a reality, AM could come to have a substantial impact on the way society is structured and interacts. In much the same way that the proliferation of digital content since the advent ofthe Internet has affected the way that people work, recreate, and communicatearound the world, AM could 1 day affect the distribution of employment,resources, and opportunities worldwide. 20.4 Exercises Do you think AM has the potential to change the world signiﬁcantly? If so, how? If not, why not? In what ways could AM’s future development mirror the development of the Internet? Find and describe three examples of digiproneurship enterprises which are not mentioned in this book. How would you deﬁne Factory 2.0?5. Based upon your interests, hobbies, or background, describe one type of digiproneurship opportunity that is not discussed in this chapter.20.4 Exercises 485References Beale CL (2000) Nonmetro population growth rate recedes in a time of unprecedented national prosperity.
