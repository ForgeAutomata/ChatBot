Although well developed scaling equations have long been used for space lift or orbit insertion propulsion systems, few if any can be applied to the low thrust regime. [35} Thrusters providing less than 10 N of thrust are currently the focus of the majority of research and development on space propulsion.[115] [361 These systems range from integrated tank, thruster, and power processing units for cubesats, to interplanetary travel, to extremely fine precision control. They are even more diverse in the means that they provide propulsion; the database that has been ac- cumulated in the course of this research includes models (specific historical thrusters) categorized into eleven distinct types of propulsion, electrical and chemical, using a variety of propellants, with several other propulsion concepts for which not enough data could be gathered to form equations. However, the systems level designers are usually not interested in how the thruster works, they care about what it will provide to their spacecraft in terms of thrust and total velocity change and what it will cost in terms of mass, power, volume, risk, or money. These numbers require an initial design phase in which the type of propulsion is chosen and some initial calculations are done to estimate how large the thruster, propellant storage, and (if necessary) electrical power system will be. In scenarios when designers want to compare several different spacecraft options, of which propulsion is only one term in a larger equation, this process can be tedious. 15 Perhaps the designer wants to run some simulations of several different options for the space system in which the number of satellites and their masses are varying, drastically changing the propulsion requirements, or perhaps some initial calculations need to be run to compare the merits of one propulsion system against another to make an initial design decision. The variety of propulsion options often makes these situations like comparing apples and oranges. The fact that there is ongoing research into improving and miniaturizing virtually every type of propulsion only makes these decisions even more difficult, stressing the need for the most current data.[70][71] This project was initially started to answer the seemingly simple question of how spacing in a satellite cluster would cause the collision avoidance requirements to change the mass fraction of their propulsion systems. A program that quickly and reliably estimated the mass fraction of propulsion systems featuring monopropellant, cold gas, and Hall thrusters based off required acceleration, total change in velocity (AV), and initial satellite mass was created as part of a parametric model that would run several thousand scenarios. The program was then used to help simulate scattering and regathering the cluster. Surprisingly, the results indicated that such operations would be feasible even for satellites under 10 kg using dual high thrust and low thrust monopropellant propulsion systems. Furthermore, since the program was created from the ground up using historical data, there was already information gathered on actual thrusters on the market that could conceivably be a part of such a system. Since then, the program has been expanded to include eighteen different propul- sion and propellant options built off of data gathered from over 300 thruster models ranging from 10 N to to 10 IN of maximum thrust. It can be run iteratively within a larger program, or it can be used stand alone: any situation where a designer requires a quick estimate of required power or mass of a propulsion system (including thruster, propellant, propellant management, and power system) given the initial mass of the spacecraft and the required AV and maximum acceleration. Data has also been gath- ered on specific impulse, efficiency, minimum impulse bit, and feed pressure, although only specific impulse and feed pressure go into the mass calculations and efficiency 16 and minimum impulse bit could not be found for a few thrusters. This thesis will describe how the program was created, including the database of thruster specifications, equations that were developed from the database, equations used to model the other parts of a propulsion system, a few necessary assumptions, validation, and some interesting applications. 17 18 Chapter 2 Fundamentals of Space Propulsion Before an examination of the program itself it would be useful to review some funda- mentals of space propulsion. Space propulsion at the most basic level is the applica- tion of Newton's third law by expelling mass at a rate n and velocity c to propel a spacecraft in the opposite direction. In propulsion, the resulting force is called thrust (T). T =m -c (2.1) While thrust relates to how quickly a spacecraft can change velocity, in orbital mechanics it is often useful to describe maneuvers in terms of total velocity change (AV) required to move the spacecraft from one orbit to another. These two variables, thrust and AV, tend to dictate propulsion choice from a design standpoint. Large spacecraft, short schedules, or rapid maneuvering will require higher thrust from a propulsion system, whereas drag cancellation, non-elliptical orbits, and long mission times and/or distances will require larger AV.[66] AV is by definition dependent on the mass of propellant (mp) expelled from the propulsion system. This relationship is described in the rocket equation, where ms/c is the initial mass of the spacecraft including propellant and g is the acceleration of 19 9.81 m/s2due to gravity. myro, = ms/c(1 -e~ V "IP9) (2.2) As can be seen from this equation, specific impulse (I,,) is also a determining factor of a spacecraft's propellant mass fraction. Ip describes the amount of thrust derived from a propulsion system compared to the mass flow rate of its exhaust (rh). T ISP = T (2.3)rh -g Although the concepts are different, the relationship between AV and I,, is analo- gous to that between distance and miles per gallon. Missions requiring high AV must use propulsion systems with high I,p in order to keep the propellant mass fraction from being prohibitively large. Unfortunately, propulsion systems with high I, tend to have low thrust to power ratios. For the purposes of this thesis, power refers to the electric power input of a propulsion system. All propulsion systems require some minimal amount of power to operate valves and possibly heaters or pumps, but some propulsion systems use electric power to create thrust, as opposed to depending on chemical reactions. The thrust of these electric propulsion systems is directly dependent on the input power. Increasing the power in turn requires a power system, including a power source such as batteries and/or solar panels and a power processing unit. All spacecraft require a power system regardless of propulsion, but electric propulsion systems can have power requirements high enough to significantly increase the mass of a space- craft's power system. In practice, this means that electric propulsion systems provide limited thrust. This brings up a fundamental distinction between electric and chemical propul- sion. Chemical propulsion provides unmatched thrust, whereas no electric propulsion system has ever been designed that can lift the weight of its own required power sys- tem off the surface of the planet. However, electric propulsion far surpasses chemical propulsion in terms of I,p, resulting in less propellant and making them the natural 20 choice for high AV missions, such as interplanetary travel. Another important factor in propulsion system design is the propellant manage- ment system. Depending on the propellant used (which also depends on the type of propulsion), multiple tanks may be required. The pressurization of propellant tanks is also important, and an optimal low mass balance must be found between large thin-walled tanks and small thick-walled tanks. For some types of propulsion sys- tems, thrust or I, may be dependent on the feed pressure of the propellant into the thruster. 21 22 Chapter 3 Predicting Relationships from Historical Data The foundation of the modeling process is a spreadsheet containing specifications of all the models of thrusters providing 10 N or less of thrust that could be found. Data has been collected on 385 specific thruster models. Best fit equations were then found to represent the relationships between different system characteristics. For example, Figure 3-1 shows the relationship of thrust to efficiency for Hall thrusters. Each point represents data gathered from a real world Hall thruster, while the curve is a best fit of the historical data, which is used to predict system characteristics in the modeling process. This approach is time intensive due to the difficulty of finding published speci- fications for many thrusters; however, it ensures that the modeling process is using hard data gathered from real world systems to compare thruster options. Of course, it does not guarantee that every thruster designed will also fit this historical data. In some case, the data was so chaotic that it was difficult or impossible to find a re- lationship between certain system specifications, and a flat average was used instead of an equation. Figure 3-2 gives an example of data that was just barely organized enough to find an equation for. In this case, it was decided that although some of the data points were drastically different from the best fit curve, using the equation of the curve would still be preferable to taking a flat average. So although the historical 23 Table 3.1: Thrusters included in the database.

Special care was taken to ensure that the equations were most accurate for lower levels of thrust, where slight differences in mass have a more serious impact on the system as a whole. Sometimes the thrusters were divided into two different regimes and separate equations were developed for both. However, the low thrust end of thruster technology is currently a focus of much research, meaning that low thrust data is few and far between, has often been gathered from experimental models, and is subject to change in the near future.[36] However, the data gathered is still more useful that what can be predicted by extrapolating from larger thrusters. Low thrust technology often uses innovative designs employing different technology and throws out assumptions that are essential to traditional methods of thruster design, which have been developed for the high thrust regime.[115] 251.2 1 -0.8 20.6 0.4 0.2 0 8 10 12 0 2 4 6 Thrust (N) It is important to stress that although this method uses real world data, it will not necessarily output the specifications of an actual real world thruster. The results from this method are representative of all of the thrusters researched and will probably not be an exact match of any of them specifically. These results are better thought of as the specifications of a theoretical thruster that could be built given what has been built in the past. Some of the thrusters in the database have not yet been flown or are engineering models of thrusters still in development, but they still provide useful data points on what can be achieved. In light of this, special care was taken not to propagate relationships beyond the limits of the data that has been gathered. If a thruster providing less than 1 N of thrust has never been built, this program will not try to conjure up what such a thruster might look like. But if thrusters providing 1 and 2 N have been built, this program will predict the characteristics of a thruster that provides 1.5 N. On the other hand, if the required thrust is higher than that of any existing model, then the program will divide the thrust until it is in range of existing models and design a system that includes multiple thrusters but unified propellant and power systems. If the user wants to know what the options are in terms of thrusters that have already been built, the database itself is still a very useful starting point. Past users have been able to validate results of this program by finding thrusters in the database that are on the market and provide even better performance than what the program estimates. In conclusion, while the relationships developed from this database of historical data are not perfect, they are the most logical starting point for providing a solid backbone of historical data to the model. As will be discussed, each propulsion type provided its own unique set of challenges. 3.1 Cold Gas Thrusters Cold gas thrusters are the simplest type of thruster. Pressurized gas is simply released through a nozzle to create thrust. Specific impulse (I.,) is largely a function of 26 propellant choice, and any kind of gas can be used. Lighter gases deliver higher I,, at the cost of lower density, resulting in heavier tanks. Nitrogen gas is usually chosen for its lack of reactivity and balance of relatively low molecular mass and relatively high density, although helium has also been used, as can be seen in Figure 3-3. Figure 3-3: Historical data for cold gas thrusters. Most of the data is gathered from using nitrogen gas, and the outlier is from using helium. Because of the low I, provided by inert gas, propellant mass is usually pro- hibitively large, making cold gas thrusters uncompetitive compared to other options as a primary propulsion system. Usually cold gas thrusters are chosen for their sim- plicity and low cost, and little thought is given to optimizing the mass of a small valve attached to a comparatively large propellant tank. The chaotic nature of the data reflects the crude nature of this propulsion option. However, the simplicity, flight heritage, and comparative safety of cold gas thrusters have made them an attractive option for small, cheap university satellites that often face safety restrictions due to being secondary missions on larger rockets.[70] Special attention has been paid towards propellants that can be stored as a liquid and expand 27160 140 * 120 100 C80 60* 40 20 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 Thrust (N) Thrust (N) Figure 3-4: Historical data for cold gas thrusters. 40 35 3025 20 a: 15 10 5 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 Thrust (N) Figure 3-5: Historical data for cold gas thrusters. 280.4 0.35 0.3 0.25 0.2 0.15 0.1 0.05 * ** 0I 0 2 4 6 8 10 Figure 3-6: Historical data for cold gas thrusters.

Liquefied gas thruster packages with integrated propellant tanks and nozzles have recently been developed specifically for cubesats.[71] Most of the characteristics of cold gas thrusters were predicted by simply averaging the data that was gathered, since no relationships could be found except for I,,, which is a constant dependent on propellant choice. For feed pressure, which is the driving factor of tank mass (a dominating part of propellant heavy cold gas systems), an equation was developed specifically for the low thrust regime. Even this equation is a poor fit of the data, but it is more accurate than a flat average across the entire range of thrust. The program offers three propellant options for cold gas thrusters: nitrogen, he- lium, or butane (stored as a liquid). The characteristics for nitrogen and helium thrusters are identical except for the I,. The characteristics for butane thrusters are gathered from VACCO's MiPS thruster shown in Table 3.1. (Only three models of liquefied gas thrusters could be found, the data on this model was the most complete, and it is currently on the market for use on cubesats.) All characteristics except for feed pressure for low thrust helium and nitrogen thrusters are constant.

The propellant flows through a heated catalytic bed in the combustion chamber to initiate the re- action. Hydrazine delivers a higher specific impulse, but because it is toxic and 30 1.4 Figure 3-8: Historical data for hydrazine monopropellant thrusters. unstable, hydrogen peroxide is sometimes chosen instead. As with other chemical thrusters, I., is largely a constant dependent on propellant choice, although some models have decreased feed pressure at the expense of I., in order to optimize for lighter tanks. Although monopropellant thrusters are certainly a chemical and not an electric propulsion system, higher thrust does correlate to higher electrical power requirements of the heated catalytic bed.[116] Monopropellant thrusters are a natural choice for secondary thrusters or station keeping on large systems. [5][35][90][30] Only one propellant tank is required, specific impulse is substantially higher than that of cold gas thrusters, and electrical power re- quirements are minimal. Recent research has focused on miniaturizing this propulsion option down to the micro- and nanosat range; however, utilization of monopropellant thrusters in this regime is dependent on the miniaturizing of the associated valves. If developed, monopropellant thrusters could provide an attractive option for a dual propulsion system on small satellites by attaching high and low thrust thrusters to a single propellant tank. 311.2 1 -0.8 20.6 0.4 0.2 0 0 2 4 6 Thrust (N)8 10 12 240 Figure 3-9: Historical data for hydrazine monopropellant thrusters. 4 3.5 3 $ 2.52 2. y = 0.0026eoc lmm R2=0.7599 t.2 v 1.5 0.5 0 140 160 180 200 220 240 Isp (s) Figure 3-10: Historical data for hydrazine monopropellant thrusters. 32220 ' -200 y = 206.21x0048 180 A R2= 0.5934 160 4 140 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Thrust (N) Figure 3-11: Historical data for hydrazine monopropellant thrusters.

Two separate sets of equations were developed for thrusters using hydrazine and hydrogen peroxide. Although trends could be identified, the data is still relatively scattered. This suggests that either other factors are at work in the design of mono- propellant thrusters, or that they have not been optimized as much as they could be, perhaps because I., is still low enough that propellant tank mass dominates the sys- tem. Theoretically, monopropellant thrusters could be miniaturized and integrated with propellant storage as cold gas thrusters have been, although not to the same extent, since the heat gradient caused by propellant decomposition becomes harder to manage as mass and volume decrease. Issues with propellant storage and safety would still prohibit their use on many small satellites, which tend to be launched as a secondary payload on a rocket whose main customer would not welcome the risk of a volatile propulsion system stored next to their larger and more expensive spacecraft.[70] Despite these barriers, Aerojet has been developing a 1U hydrazine thruster module for cubesats in accordance with most range safety requirements.

These thrusters are unmatched in terms of thrust to weight ratio and boast the highest I, of any type of purely chemical propulsion. However, they are also the most complicated chemical propulsion option, requiring two propellant tanks and the associated equipment required for pressurization and fuel delivery. While often the only viable option for space lift and orbit insertion, the complex- ity of bipropellant thrusters does not lend itself to miniaturization and low thrust applications. Thrusters that do provide less than 10 N are usually used as secondary propulsion, and as the chaotic nature of the data suggests, have not been optimized for mass. [27] [23][5] While there has been initial investigation into miniaturizing bipropel- lant thrusters using microelectricmechanical systems (MEMS) technology, propellant storage is still a barrier to implementation. [71] [561 On the other end of the spectrum, electric propulsion often outperforms bipropel- lant thrusters on large satellites if the AV requirement is high. While bipropellant thrusters have the highest I, out of any chemical propulsion option, it is still far sur- passed by most electric propulsion options. A high AV requirement often demands a high I,, to keep the propellant and tank masses from becoming prohibitively large. These factors restrict bipropellant thrusters to high thrust operations, most of which are over 10 N and outside the scope of this research. Although data from all available models was averaged to predict thruster charac- teristics, the program assumes monomethylhydrazine as fuel and nitrogen tetroxide as oxidizer in its propellant storage calculations. Power requirements were only found for one thruster and feed pressures were only found for two. 36 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Thrust (N) Figure 3-16: Historical data for bipropellant thrusters. 325 320 315 310 305 300 e 295 290285 280 275 270 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Thrust (N) Figure 3-17: Historical data for bipropellant thrusters. 37 3.4 Resistojets Resistojets improve the performance of cold gas thrusters by heating the propellant using electric resistors. This method raises the I, of the thruster, decreasing the tank and propellant masses, but adds the complexity and mass associated with the electrical power requirements. The first widely used resistojets were actually modified monopropellant thrusters, and as a hybrid of chemical and electrical thrusters were called electrothermally aug- mented hydrazine thrusters (EHTs). The development of EHTs arose from the conver- gence of stringent mass limits and surplus power supply on communication satellites that were already using monopropellant hydrazine thrusters. [35] [90] [30] However, re- sistojets can use inert gas as well. Often propellants that can be stored as a liquid and easily vaporized are chosen, such as water or ammonia. The heat augmentation process raises I. up to a point and then levels out, mean- ing that the specific impulse of resistojets is largely a function of propellant choice. There is a relatively strong correlation between thrust and power, although low power resistojets can have abnormally high thrust to power ratios due to the mechanical thrust provided by propellant pressure. Resistojets are often chosen instead of cold gas thrusters in cases where spare electrical power is already available. This similarity of application with cold gas thrusters, combined with the greater variety of propellants used, makes the data difficult to analyze. Resistojets are also amiable to miniaturization for the same reasons as cold gas thrusters, although limits are reached due to the difficulty of transferring heat to the propellant within a smaller chamber. The increase in specific impulse and using liquid propellant can keep mass low, however, this must be balanced against the higher power requirements. On the high thrust end of the spectrum, resistojets are limited by the material properties of the heating element, a barrier which is overcome by arcjets. Two sets of equations for resistojets have been developed, one for hydrazine and 38 1000 900 800 700 -600 d 500 400 300 y = 373.54x2 + 770.3x + 52.949 200 R = 0.7676 200 100 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Thrust (N) Figure 3-18: Historical data for hydrazine resistojets.

The sparse data for water resistojets raises the question as to whether they could be further optimized for small satellites, since they don't carry the risks that monopropellants do. Resistojets also enjoy an abundance of other propellant options that could open up further possibilities. A team at the University of Arkansas recently developed a 1U resistojet propulsion module for cubesats that uses R-134a refrigerant. [69] 3.5 Arcjets Arcjets are very similar to resistojets but use an electric arc to heat propellant instead of resistors. This allows for higher input power thresholds and correspondingly higher thrust and specific impulse, although efficiency is compromised. As with resistojets, ammonia is a common propellant choice. Despite the storage problems associated with light gases, some research has focused on creating high power hydrogen arcjets with the expectation that large manned space systems would have an excess on board due to boil off from cryogenically stored hydrogen.[7] As with resistojets, the first arcjets used hydrazine to take the place of hydrazine monopropellant thrusters. In a monopropellant hydrazine thruster, hydrazine is de- composed into ammonia and nitrogen in an extremely exothermic reaction, while some fraction of ammonia is further decomposed into nitrogen and hydrogen in an endothermic reaction. Good design minimizes this fraction in order to keep the ex- haust gases as hot as possible. However, the addition of heat in resistojets and arcjets, while more than compensating for the heat lost in the decomposition of ammonia, can actually raise the fraction decomposed to the point that there is no real difference be- tween using hydrazine and hydrogen nitrogen mixture as propellant.[66] In hydrazine arcjets, for example, the heat added through electrical means totally decomposes the ammonia and drowns out much of the benefit that the first chemical decomposition of hydrazine might still have to offer. The question designers are faced with is why to use hydrazine at all given its toxicity and instability. I,, is still dependent on propellant choice, especially at high power levels, but it is the molecular mass of the 43 Figure 3-26: Historical data for arcjets using various propellants. propellant (or its products after decomposition) that are decisive rather than any chemical reaction. Arcjets straddle the middle ground between purely chemical bipropellant thrusters and high powered Hall thrusters or ion engines in terms of I and required power, striking a balance between tank mass and power system mass. As with resistojets, the modeling process is complicated by the variety of the propellants used, but the high dependency performance characteristics have on electrical power makes the data much more organized. Three sets of equations have been developed for ammonia, hydrogen, and hydrazine propellants. Unfortunately, no mass data could be found for ammonia or hydrogen arcjets and feed pressures could only be found for hydrazine arcjets. The mass data for all of the arcjets, regardless of propellant, was propagated out to the maximum power recorded to estimate thruster mass, as shown in Figures 3-26 and 3-27. It is uncertain how accurate this equation is in the high thrust, high power regime. It is likely an overestimation of thruster mass, which typically increases slightly less than linearly with relation to power. 4480 70 60 y = 0.7834x- 50 R2= 0.6326 v40 30 20 10 0 0 20 40 60 Power (kW)80 100 120 Figure 3-27: Historical data for arcjets using various propellants, zooming in on the low thrust regime.

The gas is usually ionized using electron bombardment or radio frequency-induced gas discharge in a chamber before being accelerated through biased grids. Electric propulsion in general favors propellants with high molecular mass and low ionization potential. Early ion engines used mercury or cesium, which were largely abandoned due to their toxicity and tendency to contaminate the spacecraft.[88] Most ion engines today use xenon, an inert gas which is much easier to handle. The equations have been developed using data only from xenon ion engines. In comparison with the thrusters discussed so far, ion engines offer a much higher specific impulse but limited thrust to power ratio. The high specific impulse translates to propellant mass savings, but high power requirements in turn drive up the mass of the required power system. Most models are clustered around the low power end of the spectrum, but recent research has focused on high power models for use in 491.85 1.8 1.75 S1.7 1.65 .6 1.55 1.5 1.45 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 Thrust (N) 45 40 35 y = 64.664x2 + 18.216x + 0.0462 30 R2 = 0.9848 25 20 C.15 10 5 0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 Thrust (N) Figure 3-36: Historical data for xenon ion engines. 50 45 40 y 61.162x+0.6/61 35 R2= 0,9152 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 Thrust(N) Figure 3-37: Historical data for xenon ion engines. 50 12000 Figure 3-38: Historical data for xenon ion engines. interplanetary travel. [25] [39] As with many of the electric propulsion options to be discussed, the significantly reduced propellant mass brought on by higher I.,, and the complexity of the thruster makes the thruster itself a more significant contributor to the mass of the system as a whole than in chemical systems. This means that ion engines have been the focus of quite a bit of optimization, especially in the low thrust regime, and that the data lends itself to tight, orderly relationships. 3.7 Hall Effect Thrusters Hall thrusters accelerate ionized gas using a combination of electric and magnetic fields in order to create thrust. Propellant is fed into a ring shaped chamber with magnets arranged to create a radial magnetic field and an anode and cathode arranged to created an axial electric field pointing out of the open end of the thruster. Ions are accelerated out of the thruster towards the cathode by the axial electric field. 5110000 8000 -C 6000 FAy = -4.3967x2 + 357.29x + 2661.7 R2 =0.8464 4000 2000 * 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 Power (kW) Figure 3-39: Historical data for xenon Hall thrusters. The electrons, instead of accelerating in the opposite direction towards the anode, are trapped in a Hall current by the perpendicular electric and magnetic fields and exert a force on the magnets which propels the thruster. Some of the electrons make it to the anode and are in turn propelled out of the cathode to neutralize the exhaust plume. Xenon is usually chosen as a propellant for its high molecular mass, low ionization potential, and because it is inert and easy to handle. The possibility of using bismuth has been explored in high power hall thrusters for it's even higher molecular mass, lower ionization potential, and lower cost, often resulting in higher I,.[92] However, not enough data on bismuth hall thrusters exists to identify any relationships and the equations were developed using data from only xenon Hall thrusters. Research on Hall thrusters has been continuing for decades and is now concen- trated on the high and low power ends of the spectrum. The consistent, ordered data reflects the high level of effort directed towards the optimization of Hall thrusters, and the sudden decrease in performance in the low power regime is indicative of the 5280 70 y 0.8441x3 -0.0386x2 + 18.768x + 0.1972 60 R2= 0.9694 ..50 S40 30 20 10 0 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 Thrust (N) Figure 3-40: Historical data for xenon Hall thrusters.

In general, hall thrusters offer higher thrust but lower I,, than ion engines. 3.8 Pulsed-Plasma Thrusters Pulsed-plasma thrusters (PPTs) also use a combination of electric and magnetic fields to accelerate propellant. Arc discharges are pulsed through the propellant, which is accelerated by the force created from the current of the discharge and its associated magnetic field. PPTs are low thrust, low efficiency, and low Ip compared to ion engines. Their advantage is their simplicity and low power requirements. Most models use solid Teflon as propellant, which is ablated and vaporized by the discharge. This makes propellant storage on PPTs extremely simple and reliable. The low minimum impulse bit resulting from the pulsed firing of PPTs also makes them a good choice for attitude control. 250 y = 56.634xo06e R2= 0.867 200 150 100 0 50 0 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 Thrust (mN)4.00 5.00 6.00 Figure 3-42: Historical data for PPTs. 54300 9 Figure 3-43: Historical data for PPTs.

In addition, thrust to power ratio was found for many high I, models without any accompanying max thrust or max power data, implying that these relationships are not representative of PPTs' full potential. 3.9 Vacuum Arc Thrusters Vacuum Arc Thrusters (VATs) are very similar to PPTs except that the discharge ablates propellant off of the cathode itself, which replaces the Teflon block and retains the advantage of solid propellant storage. Performance is very similar to that of PPTs but with higher Ip, although some models utilize permanent magnets to substantially increase thrust. Very few VATs have been built, but they have been tested and scheduled to fly on microsatellite missions.

Since data on only four VATs could be gathered, two of which were augmented with magnets and had very different characteristics, only one was chosen to represent this propulsion option. The pVAT, built by Alameda Applied Sciences Corporation, was chosen by the University of Illinois for deployment on their satellite, ION. 3.10 Field-Emission Electric Propulsion A form of electrostatic propulsion like ion engines, field-emission electric propulsion (FEEP) extracts and propels ions from liquid metal propellant (usually cesium or 56 120 Figure 3-45: Historical data for FEEPs. indium) using a potential difference. The potential difference causes Taylor cones on the surface of the propellant, which in turn allows the emission of ions from the tips. FEEPs offer the highest I, and the smallest minimum impulse bit out of any propulsion option, but thrust is limited to the micronewton and low millinewton regime. Most applications of FEEPs take advantage of their low minimum impulse bit to provide high accuracy pointing or control, but their high I,, makes them favorable for any high AV, low thrust mission. One difficulty with FEEPs is propellant management, since the indium or cesium must be melted before emission. On the other hand, solid propellant lends itself to simple storage, and since the thruster is emitting ions, the propellant can be fed by capillary forces and requires no pressurization. Except for I,,, the data for FEEPs is relatively consistent, though sparse. 57y = 72.257x'o5 R2= 0.9161 100 80 ~60 0 CL 4 0 20 0 0.00 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00 1.20 1.40 1.60 Thrust (mN) Figure 3-46: Historical data for FEEPs.

Colloid thrusters were one of the earliest forms of electric propulsion to be investigated, but the lack of suitable propellants inhibited their development until the invention of liquid salts at room temperature. Today's colloid thrusters offer a higher thrust to power ratio than FEEPs, ion engines, and Hall thrusters but a lower specific impulse. A major advantage of colloid thrusters is the ease of propellant management. Liquid salts are easily manufactured with the right equipment, require little pressurization, and are safe to handle and store. Figure 3-48: Historical data for colloid thrusters. Unfortunately, no relationships can be discerned from the data on colloid thrusters and flat averages must be taken in order to predict most characteristics. This is prob- ably because most of the data is from old research before liquid salts were invented, and is hardly indicative of the potential of colloid thrusters. Although a variety 59 Figure 3-49: Historical data for colloid thrusters. 1600 1400 12001000 C800 600 400 200 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Power (W) Figure 3-50: Historical data for colloid thrusters. 600 1 2 3 4 Power (W)56 7 of propellants have been used, the program assumes the liquid salt EMI-BF4 in its propellant storage calculations. 3.12 Electrospray Thrusters Electrospray thrusters are conceptually identical to FEEPs except that they use liquid salt as propellant, and identical to colloid thrusters except that they emit ions instead of droplets. In fact, it may be possible to develop a single thruster using the same propellant that can act as both a colloid thruster and an electrospray. Although electrosprays offer a lot of promise, they have not yet been flown in space. Current research has achieved thrust and specific impulse levels similar to standard ion engines. Propellant management is identical to liquid salt colloid thrusters ex- cept that the propellant can be passively fed into the thruster using just capillary forces. Miniaturization of electrosprays using MEMS technology could enable them to replace ion engines in many applications due to their low mass and easy propellant management. Another unique characteristic of MEMS electrosprays is their scalability. Electro- sprays consist of hundreds of microscopic needles from which liquid salt is propelled using a voltage difference. Scaling the thruster is simply a matter of creating more needles. For low thrusts, this can be achieved by increasing the density of the needles, and the mass of the thruster remains constant. At some point the a density limit is reached and larger area is required, at which point mass will increase with thrust. Efficiency and specific impulse remain constant throughout.[55] Because of both their scalability and lack of historical data, this research models electrospray thrusters using constant scaling equations instead of equations derived from historical specifications. Even if there was extensive flight data on electrosprays, it would be more logical to use that data to find constants for the known scaling equations than to work entirely off of historical specifications, as has been done for the other propulsion types. The constants used in this research were measured from MIT Space Propulsion Laboratory's MEMS electrosprays, which are due to be tested 61 in orbit by 2014.

However, as shown by the focus on developing high I, electric propulsion systems, the mass of the propellant and the storage and management requirements that come with it is often a driving force in propulsion design and a deciding factor when choosing a propulsion system. Fortunately, the physics of how much propellant is needed and how big its tank needs to be are relatively simple. The equations developed in the previous chapter can provide I,,. From there, the mass of the propellant (mp,p) is found from the required AV and the initial mass of the spacecraft (ms/c) (provided by the user) using the rocket equation, where g is the acceleration of 9.81 m/s2 due to gravity. M,,.4 = ms/c(l -e6"v13P9) (4.1) The mass of the propellant tank (mtank) is then calculated by assuming spherical tanks with a factor of safety (FoS) of two and some given material properties. The material properties are read from within the database and can tuned specifically to each thruster type.

Under these assumptions, the mass of a propellant tank can be calculated using the equations for thin walled pressure vessels and the volume of a sphere. All that's left is to find the volume (V,,.p) and maximum pressure (Pma) within the tank. mtank = 41r[(rtank -ttank)3 -rtank]ptank (4.2) ttank = FoS ma2rtank (4.3) 207yield rtank = L (4.4) 3 rtank and ttank represent the radius and wall thickness of the tank, respectively. All tank masses calculated by this method are multiplied by two to account for other factors such as acceleration and dynamic loads, stress concentrations, and weld efficiencies. [35] For thrusters that use pressurized gas (nitrogen, helium, hydrogen, and xenon), the propellant is assumed to be an ideal gas, the minimum pressure (Pmin) is set to the feed pressure estimated from the database, and a leftover mass of propellant (mleftoverprop) is accounted for that will fill the propellant tank at the required minimum pressure. The mass of the leftover propellant is added to the mass of the tank, and the following 64 equations along with equations 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 are optimized for minimum tank mass. mltoverprop = minitialpro, -myo, (4.5) Vr= mi R (4.6) _ma minitialproRT (4.7) minitialpro represents the mass of all of the propellant initially stored in the tank and m, represents just the mass of the propellant that's expelled in order to achieve the required AV. R, T, and M are, respectively, the universal gas constant (8.3145 J/mol/K), temperature of propellant (set to 293.15 K), and molar mass of each the propellant (varies by propellant). For thrusters using pressurized liquid propellant (water, ammonia, hydrazine, and hydrogen peroxide), the propellant tank is assumed to be at constant feed pressure and mass is estimated using equations 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 by calculating the volume from the density of the liquid (pprp). V,-, = m'"" (4.8) Pprop A titanium nitrogen pressurant tank is then modeled using a process similar to that for pressurized gas thrusters except that the mass of the gas (mpres,) is constant, final volume is the combined volume of the pressurant (Vank) and propellant tanks (Vop), and minimum pressure is the pressure of the propellant (which has already been set to the feed pressure for the thruster). As with the pressurized gas tank method, the mass of the pressurant is added to the mass of the pressurant tank and the equations are optimized with 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 for minimum pressurant tank mass. mp.ess -PPro(V±op + Vank)M (4.9) mesRT (.0 Pmax = m,ek (4.10) For bipropellant thrusters, two liquid propellant tanks are calculated, one for the 65 fuel and one for the oxidizer, and a single pressurant tank with enough nitrogen to fill all three tanks at the feed pressure is calculated. Colloid thrusters are pressurized, but only slightly. Many models use pumps instead of pressurization, and recent models have used a compressible tank attached to a spring. This program calculates the mass of colloid thruster tanks the same as other liquid propellants (equations 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8) but neglects the pressurant tank. For thrusters that do not use solid or unpressurized liquid propellants (PPTs, VATs, FEEPs, and electrosprays) the propellant system mass was estimated to be 5% of propellant mass. Finally, 10% is added onto the combined mass of the thruster and tanks of all propulsion types to account for feed lines and support structures. The mass of the power system is also estimated using an assumed power density of 15 kg/kW. This mass includes power source and processing, and is representative of solar panels.[35] 66 Chapter 5 Validation Several difficulties are encountered when validating the results of the program. The first is that complete mass breakouts of propulsion systems can be difficult to find. The second is that when such data is found, it's often from systems that violate assumptions used in the program. For example, many propulsion systems use multiple thrusters even when a single thruster with the necessary thrust has been designed, either for redundancy or for attitude control. Some spacecraft end their missions without using all their propellant, and the achieved AV actually corresponds to a much smaller tank. Usually the tanks themselves are not spherical or made out of a single material, which are assumed in the tank estimation process. All of these are indicative of the fact that there are many factors in propulsion system design that this program does not take into account, such as cost, reliability, volume, and schedule. Quite simply, the program predicts what is possible, but not necessarily what is. That said, comparing the results with what data can be gathered from real world systems yields some interesting results. The four systems in Table 5.1 are those for which the most complete specifications could be found. 5.1 Aerojet Cubesat Propulsion Module The first system is a 1U hydrazine propulsion module being developed by Aerojet for cubesats. This is an example of a system for which the technology exists and 67 Propulsion Type Thrust (N) dV (m/s) Mass: S/C (kg) Propulsion (kg) Propellant (kg) Thruster (kg) Tanks (kg) Isp (s) Power (W) Max Pressure (MPa) Tank Volume (m3)Aerojet Cubesat Propulsion Module Hydrazine MonopropellantBepiColombo Xe Ion EnRineU of Minnesota Shackleton Crater MMH/MON-1 Bioronellant Table 5.1: Comparison of results from program with actual propulsion systems. feasible thrusters are recorded in the database, but which has never been integrated before into such a tight package. Aerojet uses MR-140A thrusters, for which no mass data could be found and are therefore not included in the database. The inputs in yellow are the capabilities Aerojet advertises for this system on a hypothetical cubesat. Although Aerojet is still working to make sure that the system meets range safety requirements, the program confirms that the design is feasible.[91] There are a few key differences between the system designed by Aerojet and the one that the program predicts. First of all, Aerojet's system is volume limited and designed to fit entirely within a 10 cm cube, which changes the shape of the tank from an optimal sphere. Second, Aerojet's system cannot provide its max thrust of 2.8 N at end of life, whereas the program designs a system so that the max thrust can still be achieved until all the propellant needed to achieve the required AV has been expelled. This accounts for the vast difference in maximum tank pressures, since both are designed with blow down propellant feed systems. The first difference should result in Aerojet's system being heavier, and the second should result in it being lighter than what the program predicts. Another difference is that Aerojet's system actually includes four thrusters in its mass figures, but the thrust value is for an individual thruster. The calculated numbers have been adjusted so that the mass of the predicted thruster is multiplied by four to account for this. 68Cyde Space Teflon PPT P 2.81 1 0.1451 41 100.E-051 4501 57601 102111 3.53 2 4100 445 This comparison is especially exciting because the program has predicted a system that is on the edge of what is feasible, and it just so happens that a very similar system is in the process of being built and tested. It validates the program's ability to predict systems in the low thrust regime, where much of the data is from experimental systems and the margin for error is especially tight. 5.2 BepiColombo Ion Engines The second system is the electric propulsion system on BepiColombo, a European Space Agency mission to Mercury that will be launched in 2013 and will take 6 years and 5760 m/s AV to complete the journey from Earth. This is an example of a fairly straightforward electric propulsion system within the range of what has been accomplished before. It uses T6 ion engines, which are well documented in the database.[271[111] The data for BepiColombo was assembled from two sources which were not in complete agreement. It is possible that the numbers were from different periods of the design phase, or that they actually referred to different things. Mass of the propulsion system, for example, could be taken to mean simply the mass set aside for propulsion or the mass of the propulsion module designed to ferry the spacecraft from Earth to Mercury, including guidance and control. BepiColombo actually consists of two spacecraft on a single propulsion module which will separate upon reaching Mercury, and it is unclear whether some of the numbers refer to combined propulsion on all three systems or just the propulsion module. Regardless, this case scenario provides another interesting comparison. The I, for BepiColombo's engines is higher than that predicted by the program. This is to be expected since the program estimates Ip from its historical correlation with thrust and power, but in reality I,, is somewhat independent in the design process. The mission designers no doubt picked a higher I,, to design for because of the large AV. The probability that BepiColombo plans to keep some propellant in reserve after it reaches Mercury can account for the higher propellant and propulsion masses. Data 69 on the tanks was not found, so it is unsure what effect they have on the results. 5.3 University of Minnesota Shackleton Crater Re- connaisance Mission Bipropellant System The third system is a design of a reconnaissance mission to Shackleton Crater on the south pole of the moon by students at the University of Minnesota. This is an example of a chemical propulsion system that is within the range of many systems that have been built in the past.[23] Although the spacecraft uses the 420 N EADS Astrium S400-12 as its main thruster to provide the 1021 m/s of AV, it also uses 4 N EADS Astrium S4 as guiding thrusters. The mass budget for one 4 N thruster was added to the mass budget for tanks and propellant for comparison. This assumes that the 4 N thruster provides the same I,, as the 420 N, although it as actually quite lower.[5] As can be expected, the mass of propellant is predicted to be higher than the what is budgeted for the Shackleton mission, along with the tank masses and total mass of propulsion. The difference between the actual and predicted total propulsion mass is almost en- tirely accounted for by the discrepancy between propellant and tank masses. The pressure of the tank reveals that the propellant storage system is different than the one the program designs, perhaps using pumps. In addition, it is known that the actual design uses composite tanks. Still, the programs results are remarkably similar to the actual design. This shows the validity of the model within a well known regime for chemical systems just as the BepiColombo example does for electric systems. 5.4 Clyde Space PPT Module The PPT propulsion module build by Clyde Space is a bit of a different case. First of all, it should be noted that the only data found for this system was for mass, power, and I,.[57] The inputs were chosen to predict the same propellant mass at the lowest 70 mass and power. Glancing at the database (see Table A.13), it is obvious why the program predicts higher power and mass requirements than Clyde Space's module. No thruster that requires that little power is recorded. Furthermore, Clyde Space doesn't provide any thrust data on this model, so it can't be used to extend the equations for PPTs into this regime. The program is already using the lowest thrust recorded in the database, and this system is simply outside the range of what has been recorded. This example illustrates a limitation of the program: it can only predict within the regime of what has been recorded. Clyde Space's PPT propulsion module pro- vides an I.,, that surpasses most other PPTs at a highly optimized mass and power requirement. Although the program returns reasonable characteristics, it should al- ways be kept in mind that it is possible to design a system with characteristics much worse, and sometimes much better, than predicted. 71 72 Chapter 6 Applications As previously described, one of the most useful applications of this program is within larger simulations where mass and propellant fractions of hypothetical spacecraft must be generated for a range of scenarios. The program was initially written as part of a parametric model for DARPA's System F6 project that analyzed collision avoidance in satellite clusters. An example of the results generated by the program as it was then can be seen in Figure 6-1. - 0 10 10 10 10 Average Propulsion System Mass Fraction Figure 6-1: Results from application of a preliminary version of the program for the System F6 project. 73 These results were generated for a range of mission profiles in which the mass of the satellite and the required acceleration were varying. At that point, the program included equations for cold gas, monopropellant, and Hall thrusters, and did not differentiate according to propellant. When the mass of the satellite was brought into the nanosatellite range (1-10 kg), the program showed that monopropellant thrusters were the most feasible option. Thrusters that met the requirements were found in the database that were being sold by Micro Aerospace Solutions.[94] Later it was found that Aerojet was in the process of designing an integrated system that would fly on satellites down to 2 kg in mass.[91] Lowest Mass Propulsion Option for 100 kg Satellite 10, X X + + X + Monopropellant (H4N2) + + + + + x x x X X x x x x X + Monopropellant (H202) + + + + + x X x x x x x x x X Blpropellant (NTO/MMH) 0 + + + + + X x x x x x x X x x .x x Arcjet(NH3) + + + + + + x x x x x x< x x x xIon\Engine(Xe)+ + + + + + + X * VAT (Cr) + + + + + + + x FEEP + + + + + + + X x x x + + + + + + + x ' x x X 0 1 0 [ 1 + + + + x xa a E 0 C 0 + + + + -+ + X X E O O 102+ + + + + + + x a a a a a O a + +- + + + + x x a a a a a a - + +. + + + + + x Y 1 0 01 0 4- + + +- + + xx C D 0 C O 0 +K + + + K~ 1 [ + + -+ -+ + x x a a a * 1 + + + +- -+ + + x * * * * * * -* + + + + - + * * * * -* + + + + -[ -- - * * - -- + + + +~ 4- ± 10 10 102 103 01 (m/s) Figure 6-2: Using the program to compare propulsion options for a 100 kg spacecraft. Electrosprays are not compared. Mass fractions over 90% are not shown. Much more extensive applications are possible with the most recent version of the program. For demonstration purposes, the program was iterated for a wide range 74 of thrust, mass, and AV combinations. The first example in Figure 6-2 compares propulsion options on a 100 kg spacecraft. It should be noted that some propulsion options cannot provide thrust as low as shown in these plots. If the thrust was lower than the range in the database for that type of propulsion, the program reset the thrust to the lowest recorded and calculated mass accordingly. So even though monopropellant thrusters cannot provide thrust less than 1 mN, at low AV they can still result in a smaller system than those that do. These plots assume that having more than the required thrust is acceptable, and contain no information with regard to minimum impulse bit.

Al- though it has limitations that are important to understand, it also carries the unique capability of providing quick preliminary design estimates that would otherwise be much more time consuming. In addition, the database itself can be useful if searching for a particular thruster model. The validity of the program lies in its use of histori- cal data. Assumptions are made, but a lot of these are constants that can easily be adjusted. There are several improvements that could be made to the program that are still unexplored. The first is the calculation of power system mass. Instead of using a single constant for power density, different constants could be used for different types of propulsion to represent the diverse power conditioning requirements for each type of propulsion. Scaling equations instead of constants could be used as well, reflecting the difficulty of scaling power systems into the low mass regime. If the data on power processing units and power system design is readily available, this would be very easy to add into the program. A second possibility for improvement would be in the propellant storage calcu- lations. Particularly, storage mass for unpressurized propellant is assumed to be a constant 5% of propellant mass. This may not be accurate across a wide range of propellant mass. Perhaps some estimation of surface area of the propellant can be used, but this would have to take into account the highly integrated nature of un- 79 pressurized propellant storage at low AV in FEEPs, PPTs, VATs, and electrosprays. In all practicality, some of these systems may never be designed for high AV because of their low thrust, and their propellant calculations may only be relevant within a certain regime anyways. Also, the calculations for pressurized propellants do not account for cryogenic storage, composite tanks, or fuel pumping. The reason for this was that the program was focused on systems providing less than 10 N of thrust, and the calculations require more precision as mass decreases. Systems in this regime are less likely to be optimized with these features. However, for high AV, these features open up the possibility to further optimization. Two specific sets of equations that could use some more attention are those for ion engines and for PPTs. The ion engine equations estimate I. from thrust, and this may be more accurately correlated to AV. The data for PPTs is extensive but chaotic. Perhaps more complete data can be found, or perhaps older, less optimized models can be excluded from the database. There are some PPT models that are competitive with the single VAT model used, but since they are averaged in with other models the equations portray VATs in a much better light. Some thrusters, such as PPTs, FEEPs, and VATs, are commonly integrated with their propellant and power systems. Although the program calculates thrusters, pro- pellant storage, and power separately, exceptions could be made for these thrusters if the necessary data was gathered. Most other possibilities would require a significant addition to the database, which would be very time consuming. For example, propellant storage calculations could follow the same method as thruster calculations if a database of tank specifications was created. Information on the the cost, reliability, or flight status of thrusters could be added and filters could be implemented to only return data on, for example, commercially available flight qualified thrusters. Ultimately, this direction leads away from simulation and prediction and towards choosing an actual thruster model for the designer. It is worth noting, however, that data on efficiency and minimum impulse bit have already been gathered for many thrusters in the database and could easily 80 be incorporated into any modifications. The real strength in the program, as said, lies in how quickly it can compare so many different options. As a spacecraft moves from its preliminary design phase, more extensive and specific calculations are required. For assistance in comparing propulsion options or estimating mass fractions, however, this research fills a much needed role. 81 82 Appendix A Thruster Data Table A.1: Cold gas thrusters Tmax ISP Ibt Pnax Pin Thruster (N) m (g) (s) (mNs) (W) (MPa) ref.
