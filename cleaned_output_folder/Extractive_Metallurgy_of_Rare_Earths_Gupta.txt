Important resear ch and development work conti- nues globally to explore and es tablish ways and means to put th e rare earths to use, individu- ally and collectively, in the service of humanki nd. In terms of rare earth reserves, India ranks among the top ten countries of the world. Indian rare earth research and industry date back to the 1950s and have been based on the monazi te available in the beach sands of the eastern and the southern parts of the country. Rare earth research, development, and prod uction continue to be among the import- ant activities of our Department of Atomic Energy. Our accomplishments in these areas have derived strength and continue to do so from the work emerging from the Materials Group of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Mumbai. In this context, Dr. C.K. Gupta and colleagues deserve special men tion for their continuing significant contributions to rare earth research and development. Dr. Gupta an d his colleague, Dr. N. Krishnamurthy, are eminently qualified to author this book. I am pleased to have been invited to write this foreword. The authors prepared in 1992 a comp rehensive review of the state of the art of extractive metallurgy of the rare earth s. This paper was published in the International Materials Reviews and was well received. The authors’ abiding interest in this field has found expression now in the present comprehensive volume. The authors have done a commendable job an d deserve praise for being extremely suc- cessful in fulfilling the need for such a volu me. The vast amount of information that has been brought together and organized in this book had remained scattered throughout the scientific and engineering literature. Every one involved with the extraction of the rare earths and the preparation of their numerous de rivatives for a variety of specific applications will welcome this comprehensive publication. It should be useful to both experienced professionals and neophytes in the rare earth field. I would like to mention that Dr. Gupta has authored abou t a dozen books in the field of chemical metallurgy of special metals and materials. The present book is yet anotherimportant addition to this impressive list.

The basis of this division is the availability and purity of the rare earth metals and materials and the scientific and engineering information about them. The period prior to 1950 may be called the “Dark Age. ” The next two decades were the “Age of Enlightenment.” The period after the early 19 70s may be considered the “Golden Age.” In the first three decades of this golden era a nu mber of remarkable advances and discoveries were made in the field of rare earths, and th ese have left an indelible mark on the global materials scenario. It is widely perceived that the future of the rare earths will be glorious and full of excitement, be it in science, technology, or in commercial utilization. The rare earths are a community of 17 metall ic elements, all but one occurring natural- ly (14 lanthanides and 2 associated elements). They are found in combination in mineral deposits widespread throughout the world. Nota bly large reserves exist in China, the U.S., and Australia. The word “rare” in “rare earths” arises more from the historical difficulty in separating and obtaining them as individu al pure elements than from their inherent nonavailability. There have been major devel opments in the technologies for the production of separated high purity rare earths. Highly e fficient separation technologies have been key to the exploitation of the rare earths in a wide range of now commonplace applications that have slowly become an inseparable part of modern living. The scientists at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Mumbai, India are proud to be in the global mainstream of the scientific an d technological research and development ac- tivities in the field of rare earth chemicals, metals, and alloys. The In dian rare earth program also includes commercial scale manufacture of rare earth products for domestic and inter- national markets. Our long association with rare earth research motivated us some time ago to produce a review on the extractive metallurg y of the rare earths. This was published in the International Materials Reviews . This review provided a concise guide to access and retrieve information from the vast rare earth li terature. It was, however, no substitute for a comprehensive book, which would serve as a re ference text that stands on its own with detailed information on selected topics. With the publication of the review in 1992 and our progressively increasing involvement with the rare earths, our thinking gradually trans- formed into a commitment to preserve the av ailable information on the extractive metal- lurgy of the rare earths in the form of a book. This thinking gathered further momentum because we found that although a voluminous l iterature in the form of numerous conference proceedings, a highly rated series of volumes on the physics and chemistry of the rare earth 00 Preface xv-xviii.f m Page xv Mo nday, November 8, 2004 12:52 PMelements (edited by Gschneidner and Eyring), and important trade publications and news- letters is available, all of these publications ha ve objectives different from that of our book. We are not aware of any other text that covers the subject in the manner we have attempted here. We have worked to bring together all re levant matters concerning the extractive metal- lurgy of the rare earths and related information th at, at present, remains scattered in a variety of forms of published literature. This book has been organized into seven chapters. Chapter 1, The Rare Earths , provides the background information on the pr operties and applications of the rare earths and highlights the links of thes e aspects to the totality of rare earth extraction and processing techniques. The interesting sequence of the disc overy of the rare earths is first presented, followed by a listing and disc ussion of the currently accep ted values and information pertaining to the various properties of the ra re earths. A comprehensive account of all major applications of the rare earths is then provided. Chapter 2, Resources , presents in detail all currently available information on the world’s rare earth resources, their location, qu ality, and quantity. The resource utilization trends and patterns from the times when the ra re earths were first produced as a commodity up to the present are presented. Factors leading to the unequal availabil ity of the rare earths are highlighted, and the world’s rare earth reso urces position is dealt with in the context of current and projected demands. Chapter 3, Resources Processing , incorporates a detailed account of the techniques for the processing of the various rare earth resour ces and the separation of individual rare earth elements. While placing a strong emphasis on the modern methods of solvent extraction and ion exchange, the salient features of the clas sical methods of rare earth separation are covered in detail. Various options for the treat ment of the as-mined rare earth resources by physical and chemical beneficiation met hods prior to separation are discussed. Chapter 4, Reduction , deals with the techniques fo r converting the pure rare earth oxide intermediates to the metals. The numerous scientifically interesting and technologi- cally challenging procedures for rare earth metal reduction are described in considerable detail. Chemical as well as electrochemical reduction methods have been used and the var- iety in the actual processes has come about b ecause of the different physical properties of the individual rare earth elements. Particular ly, the melting and boiling points of the elem- ents dictate the type of process best suited for reduction. These aspects are discussed. Chapter 5, Refining , is devoted to the purification of the rare earth metals. Elucidation of the unique properties of the rare earth elem ents has been possible only with the availabil- ity of these elements in very pure forms; ther efore, major efforts have gone into the develop- ment of suitable techniques such as pyrova cuum treatment, zone melting, and electrotrans- port to prepare metals of high purity levels. The chapter covers these refining techniques as applied to different rare earth metals. Chapter 6, Rare Earth Materials , is concerned with the techniques for the preparation of the numerous rare earth alloys and compou nds and rare earth bearing materials. Among the materials described are the traditional pr oducts like misch metal and rare earth–iron– silicon alloys, as well as new materials li ke lanthanum–nickel alloys, permanent magnet materials based on samarium and neodymium, magnetostrictive and magnetocaloric mater- ials. The procedures followed by various manufacturers of rare earth materials are outlined.The presentation also covers methods un der investigation for newer materials. Chapter 7 is an overview — a sojourn for th e reader in the world of the rare earths. While going through this chapter one can deve lop a brief but significant acquaintance with the rare earths in their entirety. In all the chapters the text is liberally su pported by tables and figures. Key property00 Preface xv-xviii.f m Page xvi Monday, Nove mber 8, 2004 12:52 PMvalues and results have been listed in the ta bles, and the figures comprise line drawings of equipment and flowsheets of processes. Referen ces to original papers are extensively made in the text and all the references are grouped in one place at the end of the book. The refer- ence list will serve as a very useful guide for those who want to refer to the original sources for more information on specifics. We hope this book will be useful to prof essionals involved with the extraction, separ- ation, concentration, and production of the ra re earth metals, alloys, and chemicals. They include process, production, and regulatory sta ff engineers; management as well as research and development professionals; graduate studen ts; and libraries attached to universities and R&D establishments. We would like particularly mention the cont ributions of certain people who have been especially involved, with the preparation of this book. The work pertaining to the produc- tion of the typed version of the manuscript in its finished form was very efficiently handled by Poonam Khattar. All figures for the book were drawn by Yatin Thakur. We are grateful to the editorial department of G+B, particularly to Catherine Bewick in the initial stages and to Sally Cheney, Lloyd W. Black, and Matt Uhler in the la tter stages for support- ing and encouraging us in the project.

Monday, November 8, 2004 12:39 PMCHAPTER 1 The Rare Earths 1.1 INTRODUCTION The term “rare earths” denotes the group of 17 chemically similar metallic elements, including scandium, yttrium, and the lanthani des (Spedding 1978). The lanthanides are the series of elements with atomic numbers 57 to 71, all of which, except promethium, occur in nature. The rare earth elemen ts, being chemically similar to one another, invariably occur together in the minerals and behave as a singl e chemical entity. Thus, the discovery of the rare earths themselves occurred over nearly 160 years from 1788 to 1941 (Szabadvary 1988, Weeks 1956). Then followed the proble m of separating them from one another for scientific study or industrial use. This has been one of the most challenging tasks of rare earth technology. While the attempts in sepa rating the rare earths began with the work of Mosander during 1839–1841, much of the effo rt directed to the se paration of various rare earths occurred from 1891 to 1940. During th is period, from the available mixed and separated compound intermediates many rare earth alloys and metals were prepared and commercial applications were developed for mixed or roughly separated rare earths. The following two decades, 1940–1960, were the mo st productive in terms of effective process development. Most important were the develo pment of modern separation methods, which resulted in the availability of sufficient quan tities of pure individual rare earth compounds (Powell and Spedding 1959) for the investigat ion of reduction processes to prepare pure metals and alloys (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978) and evaluation of their properties. Beginning in the 1960s, much progress was ma de in the large scale production of purer rare earths, in the identification of newer properti es, and in their use in a variety of important commercial applications. The usable forms of rare earths encompass naturally occurring oxide mixtures, and products synthesized from th em, high purity individual metals, alloys, and compounds. The current annual demand for rare earths is in the range of 80,000 to 100,000 metric tons calculated as rare earth oxi des. It has also been estimated (Jackson and Christiansen 1993) that the world rare earth re serves are large and sufficient to support the present level of consumption for many centuries to come. This chapter is a survey of the history, pr operties, and applications of the rare earths and highlights the background to their current st atus as materials of interest in the labora- tory and products of use in technology and industry. 01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 1 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 2 Table 1.1 Discovery of rare earth elements Year Mineral/element Discovered by Named by Confirmed by Origin of name 1784 Gadolinite C.A.

All the naturally occurring rare earths and all but one of all the rare earth elem ents had been discovered by the turn of the century and the discovery of the remaining one rare earth had to wait until the discovery of nuclear reactions. The rare earth elements and their discovere rs are listed in Table 1.1 and charted in Figure 1.1. The activity started at Ytterby, a village near Stockholm in Sweden. Ytterby is the site of a quarry that had been the so urce of many unusual minerals containing rare earths. In 1787, Carl Axel Arrhenius, a lieutenan t of the Swedish Royal Army and also an amateur mineralogist, found a black minera l, until then not mentioned by anyone, in Ytterby. The mineral was analyzed by the Finn ish chemist Johan Gadolin in 1794. Gadolin found iron and silicate as constituents of the mineral and also a “new earth,” which accounted for 30% of the mineral. The disc overy of the new earth by Gadolin was confirmed by the Swedish chemist Anders Gu staf Ekeberg during the following year. Ekeberg found that the mineral also contained beryllium, a me tal that had only just been discovered by the French chemist Nicola s Louis Vanquelin. The mineral found by Arrhenius turned out to be an iron–beryllium– silicate. Ekeberg gave the name “yttria” to the new earth discovered by Gadolin and also named the mineral “gadolinite.” Until the first decade of the nineteenth ce ntury, “earths” were universally considered to be elements. The fact that earths were not elements but compounds was first stated by the Hungarian chemist Antal Ruprecht but co nclusively proved by Sir Humphrey Davy who electrolyzed melts of earths and obtained metals from them. In the first decade of the nineteenth century, Davy separated numerous metals such as calcium, strontium, and barium from alkaline earths and from then on the metals were distinguished from earths. For example, chemists began to name yttrium for the metal instead of yttria even though the metal itself had not been produced in the pure state. Interestingly, another new mineral, whic h was later shown to contain an unknown earth, had been discovered by A.F. Cronstedt in the Bastnäsgrube mine close to Rydder- hyatten in Sweden in 1751, before gadolinite was discovered in Ytterby. This mineral was investigated by Jöns Jakob Be rzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger in Sweden and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in Germany. They reported simultaneously, in 1804, the discovery of a new element in the mineral. Klaproth was still considering “earths” as elements and named the new earth “ochroite earth,” while Berzelius and Hisinger statedTable 1.1 (continued) Year Mineral/element Discovered by Named by Confirmed by Origin of name 1907 Lutetium G.

They named the element “cerium” after the asteroid Ceres that had been discovered only three years earlier, in 1801. The mineral that contained cerium was named “cerite.” Carl Gustaf Mosander, an associate of Ber zelius, through his patient and painstaking investigations established that both yttria an d ceria were complex in nature and contained new elements. In 1839 Mosander separated a new element from ceria. Berzelius suggested to Mosander the name “lanthanum” for the new element (in Greek “lanthano” means “to escape notice”). Mosander believed that the lanthanum separated by him was not a pureelement but might contain yet another new element. Continuing his experiments, he succeeded in 1842 in detecting that new elem ent. He named the new element “didymium.” The element didymium, which was present in cerite, tracked lanthanum in some experi- ments while it tracked cerium in some other ex periments. It therefore got the name from the Greek word “didymos,” meaning twins, to denote that it accompanied cerium and lanthanum as a twin in the cerium mineral. The possibility of gadolinite containing new elements in addition to yttrium was already indicated by the works of Heinrich Ro se and Berzelius before Mosander turned his attention to this mineral. Reporting his resu lts in 1843, Mosander mentioned not one but two more new elements in gadolinite. He named them “erbium” and “terbium.” Beginning in the 1850s a new analytical aid, spectral analysis, began to be used to identify and confirm the existence of new el ements. In 1864, Marc Delafontaine, a Swiss- American chemist used spectroanalytical iden tification to unequivocally prove and confirm the existence of yttrium, terbium, and erbium . He interchanged, probably unintentionally, the names given by Mosander for terbium and erbium, and the interchanged names havepersisted ever since. What was called erbium by Mosander became known as terbium and what was named terbium by Mosande r came to be known as erbium. There was considerable confusion surroundi ng terbium and erbium in the 1860s. Dela- fontaine himself became doubtful while O. Po pp, Johan Fridrik Bahr, and Robert Wilhelm Bunsen denied the existence of terbium whil e accepting that erbium existed. Charles Augustus Young, a U.S. scientist, demonstrated in 1872 the existence of erbium in the solar spectrum, and the existence of erbium was doubted no more. The matter of terbium was finally resolved by Delafontaine and the Sw iss chemist Jean Charles Marignac by 1877–78. Delafontaine separated the terbium oxide from the mineral “samarskite,” which had beendiscovered in 1838 by the German mineralogi st Gustav Rose. In 1878, J. Lawrence Smith, a U.S. chemist and mineralogist, also reported th e existence of terbium in samarskite. In the same year Marignac confirmed the presence of terbium in gadolinite, the mineral in which Mosander had originally found the element. Further confirmations to the existence of terbium were provided by the spectral analysis reports of J.L. Soret in 1880 as well as by Sir Henry Enfield Roscoe and A.J. Schuster in 1882. Delafontaine reported in 1878 that the absorption spectrum of didymium separated from samarskite was not fully identical with the absorption spectrum of didymium separated from cerite. He suspected that didymium was no t a single element. Interestingly, in 1879, the French chemist Paul Emile Lecoq de Bois baudran disproved Delafontaine’s report on the spectra but did find a new element in samarskite. He named the element “samarium” after the mineral samarskite in which it was detected. Investigating gadolinite, Marignac had not on ly confirmed the existence of terbium in it but also was looking for more new elemen ts in the mineral. He worked on the erbium fraction obtained from the mineral and separated an oxide and salts that were different from01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 5 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 6 erbium in both chemical and spectral charact eristics. In 1878 Marignac named the new element “ytterbium” because it stood between yt trium and erbium in its properties. In the same year, Marignac’s ytterbium was also identi fied by Delafontaine in an yttrium niobate mineral called “sipylite,” which had been discov ered in Virginia (U.S .A.) by John William Mallet in 1877. The experiments on erbium described by Ma rignac were repeated in Sweden by Lars Frederick Nilson, and he also confirmed the existence of ytterbium and the statements of Marignac regarding it. Proceeding further, through an exceedingly intricate fractioning procedure, Nilson finally obtained a basic nitr ate from gadolinite. He dissolved the salt in nitric acid and the solution yielded a weak ab sorption line in the red and in the green spectrum. It also precipitated as an oxalat e. Nilson considered this a new element and in 1879 named it “scandium,” after Scandinavia. In Sweden, Per Theodor Cleve investigated the erbium fraction remaining after the separation of ytterbium. Based on a spectru m taken by the Swedish physicist Tobias Robert Thalén, Cleve suspected that the erbium fract ion could contain more elements. Proceeding by chemical separation and spectral analysis , he identified the existence of two new elements and named them “thulium,” after th e legendary old name of Scandinavia, and “holmium,” after the medieval Latin name of Stockholm. Before Cleve reported his discovery of the new elements in 1879, the Sw iss chemist Soret had indicated, on the basis of absorption spectrometry, the possibility that an unknown element was present in the erbium sample given to him by Marignac. So ret later stated that the unknown element mentioned by him corresponded to Cleve’s ho lmium. The statements and discoveries of Soret and Cleve were confirmed in 1879 by Lecoq de Boisbaudran. In 1886, Boisbaudran, following an elaborat e, intricate, and wearisome method for the chemical separation and spectroscopic and fluorescence studies of gadolinite rare earthelements, concluded that the holmium discove red by Cleve contained another new element. He named it “dysprosium.” Earlier, in 1880, Marignac investigated samarskite by chemical separations. He obtained the nitrate of a substance that di ffered in many respects from the other elements then known. He tentatively named it “Y α” and after more investigations by him as well as by Delafontaine and Soret, in 1886, proposed the name gadolinium for Y α. In 1885 Carl Auer von Welsbach, an Au strian chemist, began investigations on didymium. By then, it was already widely su spected that didymium might not be a single element, but chemical separation efforts to substantiate the presence of the new element were unsuccessful. Auer used fractional crys tallization instead of the hitherto applied fractional precipitation, to separate didymi um. In 1886, he succeeded in obtaining two fractions of didymium ammonium nitrate. He further investigated th em by absorption and spark spectrometry and concluded that the fr actions belonged to different elements. He named the elements “praseodidymium” and “neo didymium.” In course of time, “di” dis- appeared from these names and they came to be known as praseodymium and neodymium.Mosander’s naming of the “element” didymi um, meaning twins, was indeed prophetic. Auer’s discovery of praseodymium an d neodymium was questioned by Henry Becquerel in 1887, but in 1890 Auer’s experi ments were repeated by A. Bettendorf, and the existence of praseodymium and neodymium was confirmed. The unseparated mixture of praseodymium and neodymium, however, co ntinued to be referred to by the name didymium. Samarium, discovered in 1879 in the orig inal didymium by Boisbaudran, was also confirmed as a new element by Cleve. In 1886, the French chemist Eugene Demarcay01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 6 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 7 announced that he separated a new element fro m samarium. He substantiated his claim only 15 years later in 1901 when he succeeded in prep aring it as a pure substance in the form of the double nitrate with magnesium. He name d the element “europium.” In 1904, europium was also separated from gadolinium by the French chemist Georges Urbain. In 1905 Auer mentioned that Marignac’s y tterbium probably contained new elements. Two years later, he published experimental results supporting his doubt and stated that ytterbium consisted of two elements. He named them “aldebaranium” and “cassiopeium.” Almost simultaneously, Urbain also reported that ytterbium consisted of two elements, which he named “neoytterbium” and “lutetium. ” In course of time the name ytterbium (for neoytterbium) and lutetium survived. The na me lutetium was derived from the ancient Roman name of Paris. With the discovery of lutetium, the story of the discovery of the naturally occurring rare earth elements, which lasted for well over a century, ended. Even though all the naturally occurring rare earth elements had been discovered, the discoverers themselves did not realize that fact. For example, both Auer and Urbain continued to work on reporting new elemen ts. But that was not to be. The theoretical explanation of the great similarity of the prope rties of the rare earth elements and also the maximum limit for their number came in late r years with the development of the atomic theory. Atomic numbers were introduced by van den Broek in 1912, and Henry Growyn Jeffreys Mosley discovered in 1913 a mathem atically expressible re lationship between the frequency of x-rays emitted by the element serv ing as anticathode in the x-ray tube and its atomic number. Urbain subjected all the rare ear th elements discovered in later times to the Mosley check, to determine their atomic num bers and thus confirm that they were true elements. The range of rare earth elements , from lanthanum with atomic number 57 to lutetium with atomic number 71, was establis hed. Amongst these, the element with atomic number 61 was yet unknown. In 1941, researchers at the Ohio State Un iversity irradiated praseodymium, neodym- ium, and samarium with neutrons, deuterons, and alpha particles and produced several new radioactivities, which were most probably th ose of element 61. The formation of element 61 was also claimed in 1942 by Wu and Segr e (1942). Chemical proof of the formation of element 61 was provided in 1945 at the Clin ton Laboratory (now the Oak Ridge National Laboratory) by Marinsky, Glendlin, and Goryel l (1947), who used ion exchange chromato- graphy to obtain the element from the products of fission of uranium and of neutronbombardment of neodymium. They named th e element “promethium” after Prometheus, who stole fire from the Gods for man (Szabad vary 1988). Promethium does not occur in nature. 1.3 SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS The close chemical similarity of all the rare earth elements is, first of all, displayed in their occurring together in nature and further by the fact that it took nearly 160 years of efforts by many great names in science to isolate and identify them. It has been borne out byexperimental evidence that striking similari ties among the chemical properties of the elements and their compounds is the cons equence of strikingly similar electronic configurations.01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 7 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 8 1.3.1 Electronic Configuration The electronic configurations of the rare earth elements are listed in Table 1.2. Scandium, yttrium, and lanthanum are the elements that begin three successive series of transition elements. Their valence electron configurations are ns2(n – l)d1 with n = 4, 5, and 6, respectively. They have no f electrons. The 14 elements following lanthanum, namely, cerium to lutetium, are the lanthanides (lanthan um like) and have valence electron configur- ations represented by 6 s25d14fn–1 or 6s24fn. The 5 d and 4 f electrons have similar energies in the neutral rare earth atoms, and this is the reason for two typical electronic configur- ations. The elements cerium to lutetium constitute the series known as the “inner transition” elements or “ f” elements. It must, however, be stat ed that the electronic configurations given are not known with complete certainty because of the great complexity of the electronic spectra of these atoms and th e consequent difficulty in analysis. The ionization potentials of rare earth elem ents are comparatively low. The elements are therefore highly electropositive and form co mpounds that are essentially ionic in nature. While all the rare earths form M3+, some of them also occur in +2 and +4 states. These states are always less stable than the +3 stat e. The occurrence of +2 and +4 states in certain rare earths, which is of considerable impo rtance in rare earths extractive metallurgy, is related to their electronic structures and ionizat ion potentials. Special stability is apparently associated with an empty, half filled, and filled “ f” shell configurations. The rare earths scandium, yttrium, and lanthanum form only the M3+ ions because this results in the inert gas configuration. Lu tetium and gadolinium form only the M3+ ions because they then attain the stable 4 f14 and 4 f7 configurations, respectively. The most stable M2+ and M4+ ions are formed by those rare earths that can thereby attain f0, f7, or f14 configuration. Thus, Ce4+ and Tb4+ attain the f0 and f7 configurations, respectively, and Eu2+ and Yb2+ attain the f7 and f14 configuration, respectivel y. In other words, the special stability of the f0, f7, and f14 configurations is an important factor in determining the existence of oxidation states other than +3 in the rare earths. However, there could be other thermodynamic and kinetic factors that are of equal or greater importance in determining the stability of the oxidation states. 1.3.2 Lanthanide Contraction The term “lanthanide contraction” is used to denote the significant and steady decrease in the size of atoms and ions with the increase in atomic number as the lanthanide series is crossed from lanthanum to lutetium. Thus, as gi ven in Table 1.2 and Figure 1.2, lanthanum has the greatest and lutetium the smallest radi us. The cause of the contraction is stated to be the imperfect shielding of one electron by another in the same subshell. As one proceeds from lanthanum to lutetium, both the nuclear charge and the number of 4 f electrons increase by one at each element. Owing to the shape of the orbitals, the shielding of one 4 f electron by another is very imperfect. Atomic nucleus is poorly shielded by the highly directional 4 f electrons and, as a result, at each increase of the atomic number the effective nuclear charge experienced by the 4 f electron increases, resulting in a re duction in the size or contraction of the entire 4 f shell. With successive increase in at omic number, such contractions accu- mulate and result in the steady decrease in size. This is the famous lanthanide contraction. Lanthanide contraction is the root cause of many features of the rare earths’ chemistry. The chemistry of lanthanides is predominantly ionic and is determined primarily by the size01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 8 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 9 Table 1.2 Properties of rare

Even though the lanthanum atom and its tripositive ion are considerably larger in size than the corresponding yttrium species, the magnitude of lanthanide contrac- tion is so much that the radii of the lanthani de species decrease to th ose of the yttrium species in the general holmium–erbium region. The simi larity in the outermost electronic arrange- ment and the similarity in size due to lant hanide contraction explains the occurrence of yttrium in association with the heavier lanthani des. For essentially the same reason, it will be seen later that (i) yttrium compounds always concentrate with those of the heavier lantha- nide elements in almost all fractionation pro cedures for the rare earths separation, (ii) con- siderable difficulty is experienced in separati ng yttrium from the heavier lanthanides, and (iii) yttrium exhibits general similarities in solubility, crystal structure, and in overall chemical properties with the heavier lanthani de metals. These factors, combined with the greater natural abundance of yttrium compared to the heavier rare earths led to these rare earths being popularly called the “yttrium earth s.” The chemistry of heavier rare earths is essentially the chemistry of yttrium. The lanthanide contraction was sufficient for decreasing the atomic and ionic size of the heavier rare earths to th ose of yttrium but not to thos e of scandium. The atomic and trivalent ionic radii of scandium are far too small. Thus, scandium does not occur in rare earth minerals, and its chemistry is significantly different from that of the other rare earth elements. 1.3.3 Basicity One of the important properties of rare earth elements, related to their ionic size, which is in turn related to lanthanide contraction, is basicity. Basicity de termines, in one way or another, certain important chemical features of rare earths relevant to their extractive metallurgy. Basicity determines the extent to which cations hydrolyze in aqueous solution, the relative solubilities of salts of all type s, the ease with which salts containing oxyanions Figure 1.2 Lanthanide contraction. 01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 17 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 18 decompose when heated, and the stabilities of complex ions (Moeller 1961). A base tends to lose anions or electrons. Thus those cations with the least attraction for anion or electron are considered to be the most basic and those with the strongest attraction to be the least basic. Considering size relationships alone, th e rare earth ions get arranged as follows in the order of decreasing basicity. La3+ > Ce3+ > Pr3+ > Nd3+ > Pm3+ > Sm3+ > Eu3+ > Gd3+ > Tb3+ > Dy3+ > Ho3+ > Y3+ > Er3+ > Tm3+ > Yb3+ > Lu3+ > Sc3+. Cerium (IV) is less basic than any of the tripositive species, and all of the dipositive species are more basic than the triposit ive species (Moeller and Kremers 1945). The variation in basicity is the basis of most of the fractionation procedures for separating the rare earth elements from on e another (Moeller 1961). In the so-called classical separation procedures, exploiting th e differences in basicity, a large variety of fractional crystallization and fractional precip itation methods had been used. Later, the techniques of ion exchange and solvent ex traction, which again ultimately operate exploiting basicity differences, have been used. The separations involving selective oxidation and reduction are also related to ba sicity because final removal from the contami- nating tripositive species is usually effected by exploiting basicity differences between the different oxidation states of the element. Mo eller (1961) emphasized that were it not for size induced alterations in basicity, the separa tion of the rare earth metal species would be a nearly insolvable problem. A note of caution appears to be in order here. To readily achieve what has been stated in the previous paragraph, basicity differences should be large, the larger the better. Even though the size differences between the end me mbers of the series or between two states of oxidation are substantial, the differences betw een adjacent members of the series in a given state of oxidation are at best very small. Therefore, generally, separations of adjacent members of rare earths are most difficult . However, there are exceptions like La3+–Ce3+. 1.4 PROPERTIES In the elemental form, the rare earths are lustro us, iron gray to silvery metals. They are typ- ically soft, malleable, ductile and usually react ive. Their reactivity is especially strong at elevated temperature or when finely divided. The physical properties of the rare earth elements are listed (Cannon 1974, Gschneid- ner and Daane 1988, Gschneidner 1990, Gschneidne r et al. 1995, McGill 1997) in Table 1.2. 1.4.1 Melting Point The melting points increase in a regular manner across the series from lanthanum to lutetium with the exception of cerium, euro pium, and ytterbium. The melting point of lutetium is almost twice that of lanthanum. While considering the increase in the melting point by as much as 750°C, as the rare earth series is traversed from lanthanum to lutetium, as unusual for a group of nearly identical el ements, Gschneidner and Daane (1988) attribute the change in the melting point to th e extent of hybridization of the 4 f and 5 d6s orbitals. The hybridization is the largest for cerium (t he lowest melting rare earth metal) and01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 18 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 19 decreases along the series from light lantha nides to heavy lanthanides. A lower melting point is associated with a greater amount of hybridization. Various values have been reported for the melting points of the rare earth metals and this variety is traceable to the purity of the me tal and the method used for the determination of the melting point. The temperature at whic h the rare earth metal melts depends on its purity. If appreciable quantities of oxygen, car bon, and nitrogen are present in the sample, the measured melting points are likely to be hi gh (Spedding et al. 1968). In small quantities, these impurities can lead to lower readings of the melting point (Gschneidner and Daane 1988). For example, early reports on the meltin g point of lanthanum put it at 806°C, but the currently accepted value is 918°C. The dete rmination of the La–C phase diagram by Spedding et al. (1959) revealed that the La–C eutectic melts at 806°C. Early samples of lanthanum metal were prepared by fused salt electrolysis using graphite electrodes, and melting point determinations using these samp les, usually contaminated with carbon, led to the eutectic being reported as the pure meta l’s melting point. The availability of relatively large amounts of metallothermically prepared pu re rare earth metals in the 1950s led to more accurate determination of their melting points. Melting point determined by thermal analysis using a refractory metal crucible also needs to be checked for the possibility of eutectic being reported as the melting point. In tantalum, however, the eutec tic point and the actual melting point are very close to each other, differing by less than 1°C, in low melting rare earths but the difference may be appreciable in high melti ng rare earths (Garg et al. 1996). The differ- ence between the eutectic temperature and the actual melting point is much smaller in the corresponding rare earth–tungsten syst ems (Krishnamurthy et al. 2000). The melting point of the rare earth metal is an important parameter in determining the reduction process usable for metal producti on, both in metalloth ermic and electrolytic processes. Relatively inexpensive chloride re duction processes can be used for producing certain low melting rare earth metals, whereas more expensive fluoride reduction methods are needed for the high me lting rare earth metals. 1.4.2 Boiling Point The vapor pressures of all the rare earth metals were systematically determined at Ames in the 1950s using the Knudsen effusion techni que for all the rare earth metals except promethium. Their data along with the values for promethium are included in Table 1.2. The boiling points of rare ear th metals do not exhibit a sy stematic variation, even to the extent that the melting points displayed, across the series. Lanthanum metal, which is among the four lowest melting point rare ear ths, has the highest boiling point. In other words, it has the lowest vapor pressure at it s melting point for any rare earth metal. The most volatile rare earth metal is ytterbium. At 1000°C, for example, the vapor pressures of lanthanum and ytterbium differ by more than one billion (Gschneidner and Daane 1988). The heat of vaporization data for the rare earth s are also listed in the table. Habermann and Daane (1961) noted certain correlations among th e vapor pressure (boiling point), heat of vaporization, and electronic structure of the rare earth metals. For example, the divalent europium and ytterbium in the metallic state have no d electrons, resulting in weaker bonding. Consequently, vapor pressure is high er and the heat of vaporization lower. Later Gschneidner and Daane (1988) considered the electronic states of both the condensed phase and also the final gaseous atom in corre lating the electronic structure to boiling point and heat of vaporization.01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 19 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 20 Like the melting point, the bo iling point of the rare earth metal also strongly influences the method used for its preparation and purifi cation. For example, the most volatile metals — europium, samarium, and ytterbium — are prep ared by the reduction–distillation pro- cess, which is very similar to the Pidgeon process used for magnesium (Pidgeon and King 1948). In these and other metals, the high vapo r pressures are also exploited for the purifica- tion of metal by sublimation or distillation (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978). On the other hand, relatively high volatility of many of th e rare earth metals has been a major limitation in the application of ultrapurification tec hniques like solid state electrotransport. 1.4.3 Allotropes The crystal structures and lattice parameters of all the rare earth metals, except samarium, promethium, and holmium, were determined quite early by Klemm and Bommer (1937). Their work confirmed the existence of the la nthanide contraction, discovered the multi- valency in cerium, europium, and ytterbium, an d confirmed that the rare earths crystallize in at least three different structures: fcc, bcc, and hcp. Final and finer details of room temperature crystal structures of rare earth metals were established at Ames by various researchers between 1958 and 1971. The details of crystal structures, lattice parameter, and allotropic transformation temperatures of rare earths are summarized in Table 1.2. Most of the rare earth metals crystalli ze in the close packed hexagonal structure. However, the stacking sequence along the c-axis is not identical for all. Lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium and neodymium crysta llize with one stacking sequence; gadoli- nium to lutetium crystallize in another; an d samarium has yet another arrangement. Most of the rare earth metals undergo allotropic transformation and the high temperature phase just below the melting point is invariably bcc. Europium, which is bcc even at room temperature, undergoes no transformation. Ho lmium, erbium, thulium, and lutetium also are monomorphic (cph) and do not undergo an allotropic transformation to the bcc phasebefore melting at atmospheric pressure. However, by application of pressure (~1 GPa), thebcc phase can be transformed in holmium and erbium. As regards the allotropictransformation temperatures, there is apparen tly no systematic trend across the lanthanide series (Gschneidner and Daane 1988). The allotropic transformation is important in rare earth metal ultrapurification. The electrotransport mobilities of interstitial im purities in rare earth metals depend on the crystal structure of the metal. Mobility is higher in the bcc ph ase. Thus when no other com- plication crops up, electrotran sport purification is best ca rried out in the bcc phase. The light rare earths form solid solution with each other, and so do the heavy rare earths. The solid solution is not perfect and th e liquidus and solidus lines are curved. When a light rare earth is alloyed with a heavy rare earth, two phases are likely to form. 1.4.4 Resistivity The rare earth metals are poor electrical conductors. Among the rare earths, room temperature resistivities are highest in the cent er of the series. They also show anisotropy. Resistivity measured along the c-axis of a rare earth metal single crystal differs from that measured along the a- or b-axis in the basal plane. Rare earths are self-resistance heated during their purification by solid state electrotransport.01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 20 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 21 The resistivity of the metal at 4 K is sensit ive to the presence of impurities, particularly oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen to the extent that it can be used for denoting the metal purity. A well-known method for estimating the total purity of a metal is to measure the ratio of resistivities at 298 K and at 4 K, or even 1 K. The impurities must be very low if the resistivity ratio obtained is very high. For certain rare earths, however, in spite of good purity, the resistivity ratio ob tained may not be very high. Among the rare earths, only lanthanum is superconducting at atmospheric pressure (Gschneidner and Daane 1988) and elemental lanthanum (fcc phase) is one of the better elemental superconductors ( Tc = 6.1 K, Hc(0) = 1600 Oe) like lead ( Tc = 7.2 K) and niobium (Tc = 9.2 K). At a high pressure of 20 GPa, lanthanum has the highest known elemental superconducting transition temperatures (13 K ). Certain lanthanum-based ceramic compos- itions are, however, important superconducting materials. 1.4.5 Magnetic Properties The 4 f electrons determine the magnetic behavior of the rare earth metals. In the completed 4f subshell, the magnetic effects of different electrons cancel each other out, but in the incomplete 4 f subshell, they do not. All rare earth metals, except scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, ytterbium, and lutetium are str ongly paramagnetic. On cooling many of them become antiferromagnetic, and on cooling fu rther a number of these elements become ferromagnetic. If a magnetic field of sufficient strength is applied, all paramagnetic rare earths become ferromagnetic at low temperatur es. The rare earth metals display strong anisotropy; their magnetic behavi or depends on the crystal axis. The existence of ferromagnetism at room te mperature in gadolinium was reported by and confirmed by Klemm and Bommer (1937). Mu ch of the detailed studies on the mag- netic behavior of the rare earth elements we re carried out by the Ames group in the 1950s. Elucidation of the magnetic behavior of the rare earth metals, as has been the case with their many other properties, was greatly dependent on the availability of the rare earth metals in high levels of purity and in special forms su ch as large single crystals (Gschneidner and Daane 1988). 1.4.6 Spectral Properties The trivalent rare earth ions, except Ce3+ and Yb3+, exhibit very sharp absorption bands in the visible and ultraviolet regions. These bands are caused by f–f transitions and the sharpness comes because the electrons in the 4 f inner shell of the rare earths are shielded from the chemical environment by the 5 s2p6 octet. Most of the rare earth salts display colors that are characteristic of the tripositiv e ions. The striking colors persist in aqueous and nonaqueous solutions and are unaffected by alterations of anions present or the addition of complexing agents (Moeller 1971 ). The absorption bands and colors are listed in Table 1.2. In the rare earths with electronic configurations 4 f1 and 4 f13 no f–f transition is possible. Thus, Ce3+ and Yb3+ do not absorb in the visi ble region. They do, however, absorb in the ultraviolet region due to transitions of the type 4 fn–4fn–15d. The divalent ions of europium, samarium, and ytterbiu m display colors in aqueous solutions: Eu2+ is pale yellow, Sm2+ is deep red, and Yb2+ is yellow.01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 21 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 22 1.4.7 Mechanical Properties Values for the elastic and mechanical proper ties of rare earth metals reported in the literature vary widely. This is because of the variation in the impurity levels of the metals. Generally the elastic property values increase with an increase in purity (Gschneidner and Daane 1988). The chosen values (Gschneidner 19 90) are listed in Table 1.2. In the series, there is an increase in the elastic moduli with an increase in atomic number until a maximum is reached at thulium. Cerium, eu ropium, and ytterbium have anomalously low values. The elastic constants of rare earths are similar in value to those of aluminum, zinc, cadmium, and lead. The hardness and strength values of the rare earths (Gschneidner and Daane 1988, Gschneidner, 1990) follow the same periodic trend displayed by the elastic constants. Cerium, europium, and ytterbium have anom alously low values. Mechanical properties improve from the light rare earths to the heavy ra re earths. In the lower range, the strengths of rare earth metals are similar to that of aluminum, and in the higher range the values correspond to levels between aluminum and titanium. 1.5 REACTIVITY 1.5.1 Air/OxygenAt room temperature, all the rare earth metals are not affected by air the same way. Some corrode very rapidly while some remain br ight and shiny for years. A solid block of europium tarnishes immediately on exposure to air at room temperature, particularly when the air is moist. If left in that condition, it wi ll get converted to an oxide of europium in a few days or weeks. Massive blocks of lant hanum, under similar conditions, will undergo surface corrosion in a few days and will develo p a thick crust of oxide in a few months. Neodymium behaves in the same way as lanthanum; however, most of the heavy rare earth metals will remain bright for a long time. Increase in temperature and humidity accel erates oxidation of rare earth metals (Gschneidner and Daane 1988). The rate at which lanthanum oxidizes increases by more than a factor of ten when the relative humid ity is increased from 1 to 75%. The oxidation of lanthanum at 1% humidity, which is 0.8 mg/cm 2 day at 35°C, increases to 5.1 mg/cm2 day at 95°C, rising further to 32 mg/cm2 day at 400°C, and to 130 mg/cm2 day at 600°C (Love and Kleber 1960). The value at 75% relative humidity is 210 mg/cm2 day at 95°C. Under the latter conditions, praseodymi um oxidizes at the rate of 55 mg/cm2 day, neodymium at 20 mg/cm2 day, and samarium at 1 mg/cm2 day. The corresponding values for the trivalent lanthanides gadolinium thro ugh lutetium, scandium, and yttrium are 0 to 0.35 mg/cm2 day. The oxide products formed by the oxidation of the light rare earths, lanthanum through neodymium, are the hexagonal A form RE2O3 phase. Samarium through gadolinium form the monoclinic β form RE2O3 and the remaining rare earths form the cubic C form RE2O3 phase. The A form oxides react r eadily with water vapor in the air to form an oxyhydroxide, and this spalls exposing the fresh metal surface which undergoes oxidation. The C-type structure oxides form a tight coherent stoichiometric gray black coating, preventing further oxidation.01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 22 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 23 The rate of oxidation is sped up consid erably if the metal contains one or more impurities such as fluorine, calcium, magnesium, carbon, iron, and many of the p-group elements such as zinc, gallium, germanium, and their congeners. Pure metals are attacked by oxygen and moisture slowly at first bu t once oxidation starts, the oxide apparently catalyzes the reaction and oxidation is fast. 1.5.2 Refractories The reactivity of rare earth metals toward oxy gen is due to the large negative free energy of formation of the oxide, and the free energy of formation of rare earth oxide is among the most negative of all the elements in the period ic table. In other words, the rare earth oxides are among the most stable of the oxides of all elements in the periodic table. At room temperature only calcia is more stable than th e rare earth oxides. As a consequence, the rare earth metals could attack and reduce most of the refractory crucibles, including zirconia, alumina, and magnesia and such refractor y linings (Kremers 1961). The attack on refractories is particularly relevant when c ontainment of the liquid rare earth metal is considered. Rare earth metals form solid solutions with oxygen. These solutions have greater stability (Alcock 1976) and this leads to the rare earth metal picking up and dis- solving oxygen from oxides of comparable (fo r example, MgO) or greater (for example, CaO) stability. 1.5.3 Nitrogen Rare earth metals show strong affinity for nitrogen. The mononitrides of rare earths are comparable in stability to those formed by me tals such as titanium or zirconium (Pankratz et al. 1984). They have high melting points and very low decomposition pressures. The metals also form solid solutions with nitrog en. For example, cerium dissolves up to 0.3 wt % nitrogen at 750°C. The equilibrium nitr ogen pressures over these solutions will be still lower. Thus the rare earths are very good getters of nitrogen from the environment and do not easily degas with respect to nitrogen. The reaction between rare earth metals and nitrogen is, however, slow. High tempera- tures are needed to observe any appreciable r eaction. Besides, the formation of a nitride layer on the surface greatly retards further nitridation. 1.5.4 Hydrogen Rare earth metals react with hydrogen and easily form hydrides at temperatures of 400 to 600°C. If hydriding is allowed to continue, wh en the metal is hydrided up to and beyond REH2, the solid material fragments. When the hydrogen content is below REH2, the material behaves like a metal and at certain concentrations of hydrogen conducts electricity better than even the pure metal. It is possib le to load more hydrogen per unit volume in yttrium metal than in liquid hydrogen or water. The decomposition pressure of YH2 is low even at fairly high temperatures and becomes 1 atm only at 1260°C (Spedding et al. 1968). Unlike the yttrium hydride, several rare earth metal hydrides decompose and degas evolving hydrogen at relatively low temperat ures. The brittleness and crumbling tendency01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 23 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 24 of the hydride, combined with the possibility of easy hydrog en removal by degassing has made hydriding–comminution–dehydriding a meth od to make rare earth metal powder. It is, however, likely that the effort to driv e off last traces of hydrogen from the powdered hydride, by the use of high temperatures, will result in a partially si ntered mass of powder (Gschneidner and Daane 1988). 1.5.5 Carbon All rare earths are known to form dicarbides REC2 and most of them (La–Sm, Gd–Ho, Y) form sesquicarbides, RE2C3. Monocarbides (e.g., ScC, LaC) and subcarbides (e.g., RE3C4, Sm, Gd–Lu) are also known (Goldschmidt 1967) . The rare earth carbides are high melting and form extensive solid solutions with oxygen and nitrogen. The solid solubility of carbon in rare earth metals is also considerable (M assalski et al. 1990). For example, yttrium dissolves up to 1.3 wt % C at 1520°C and lanthanum takes up to 0.3 wt % C at 775°C. The high stability of the lower carbides of rare earths and also of the carbon–RE solutions make the attack of molten rare earth metals on grap hite crucibles an important factor leading to contamination of rare earth metals with carbon. Besides, these characteristics have rendered carbothermic reduction a useless method for rare earth metal preparation. 1.5.6 Silicon Silicon, like carbon, forms rare earth silicides and solid solutions. Ra re earth silicides are generally all disilicides represented by the formula RESi2, but silicides of other stoichio- metry have also been reported (Goldschmidt 1967). 1.5.7 Sulfur, Selenium, Phosphorus The rare earths react exothermically with su lfur, selenium, and phos phorus. On heating a mixture of rare earth metal with these elements , the reaction sets off and, if precautions are not taken, could seriousl y damage the crucible, furnace, vacuum enclosures, etc. On the other hand, at low temperatures, some of the rare earths, particularly heavy rare earths, hardly react with, for example, sulfur. 1.5.8 Refractory Metals Among the refractory metals, niobium, molybde num, tantalum, and tungsten are resistant to attack by liquid rare earth metals. The me tals listed above are in order of decreasing solubility in the liquid rare earth metals at high temperatures, tungsten being the least soluble (Dennison et al. 1966, 1966a). About 1.5 at. % tantalum is soluble in lutetium at the eutectic temperature and the corresponding so lubility of tantalum in scandium is about 3 at. %. When tungsten is used in place of tantal um, the solubility of tu ngsten in liquid rare earth metals is about one-third of the solub ility of tantalum. This makes tungsten the most inert container for holding liquid rare earth metals. However, tungsten embrittles and has poor mechanical properties compared to tantal um. Thus tantalum is a more useful crucible01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 24 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 25 material for liquid rare earths in spite of its solubility in rare earths. The solubility of tantalum is a function of temperature, and fo r many rare earth metals it decreases from a high value at high temperatures to a very low value at temperatures just above the rare earth metal’s melting point. Commenting on the interaction of tantalum wi th liquid rare earth metals, Gschneidner and Daane (1988) have stated that the use of ceramic crucibles for metal preparation and purification puts an upper limit of 95–98 at % purity of the rare ear th metals. The use of tantalum has allowed purity leve l to rise to 99 at % and higher. 1.5.9 Acids and Bases All rare earth metals readily dissolve in dilu te mineral acids and hydrogen is evolved. In a certain range the rate of dissolution is pro portional to the acid concentration (Gschneidner and Daane 1988). Attack on the metal by co ncentrated sulfuric acid is somewhat less (Kremers 1953). Rare earth metals resist attack by hydrofluoric acid because REF3 forms and coats the metal. This coating prevents fu rther attack by the acid. A mixture of equal parts of concentrated nitric acid and 48% hyd rofluoric acid attacks most rare earths only superficially and may be used to clean/pickle the rare earth metals. This acid mixture may be used to separate tantalum from the rare earths because only tantalum dissolves whereas the rare earths remain more or less intact (Gschneidner and Daane 1988). Rare earth metals react with common organic acids but at slower rates than with mineral acids of the same concentration. Rare earth metals react, but slowly, with st rong bases like sodium hydroxide. With a weak base like ammonium hydroxide no reactio n occurs. The lack of reactivity may be due to the formation of an insoluble rare ear th hydroxide coating on the metal surface. 1.5.10 WaterThe reaction of rare earths with water varies depending on the metal. Generally light rare earth metals react with water, slowly at room temperature and vigorously at higher tempera- ture. The heavy rare earths react very slowly . However, even with cold water, europium reacts to form Eu(OH) 2.H2O, liberating hydrogen (Spedding et al. 1968). 1.6 AQUEOUS SYSTEMS The standard oxidation potential data listed in Table 1.2 indicate that each of the rare earth elements is a powerful reducing agent in aque ous acidic solution and forms the tripositive ion readily. The special stability of empt y, half filled, and completely filled 4 f shells are reflected (Moeller 1967) in that the 4 f0 cerium (IV) is much less readily reduced to the tripositive state than the 4 f1 praseodymium (IV). For similar reasons, 4 f7 europium (II) and 4 f14 ytterbium (II) are weaker reducing agents than samarium (II).01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 25 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 26 1.6.1 The Trivalent State The rare earths are characteristically trivalent. In aqueous solution, the tripositive rare earth cations have a strong ionic character and form salts with a large variety of anions. The solubilities of such salts vary widely. Rare earth hydroxides are obtained as ge latinous precipitates from aqueous solutions by the addition of ammonia or dilute alkalies. Rare earth hydroxides are definite com- pounds and are not just hydrous ox ides. As mentioned earlier, La(OH)3 is the most basic of the rare earth hydroxides and the basicity d ecreases across the series with increase in the atomic number. Rare earth salts containing therma lly unstable anions such as OH–, CO32–,a n d C2O42–, when heated, yield first the basic deriva tives and finally the oxides. The hydrated salts, regardless of the nature of the anion, undergo thermal hydrolysis at high tem- peratures. Anhydrous compounds of rare earths containing thermally stable anions such as O2–, F–, Cl–, and Br– melt without decomposition at rela tively high temperatures. These solids are also highly ionic. The chlorides, bromides, nitrates, bromates, and perchlorate salts of rare earths are all soluble in water. When their aqueous solution s are evaporated, they precipitate as hydrated crystalline salts. For example, the rare eart h chlorides crystallize as hexahydrates. The light rare earths (La to Nd) can form heptahydrates. On heating, the hydrated chlorides lose HCl more readily than H2O. The product is oxychloride. Th e bromides and iodides are quite similar to the chlorides. The iodides as well as the iodates and acetates are somewhat less soluble in water. The sulfates are sparingl y soluble and their solubility decreases with increase in temperature. The rare earth oxides , sulfides, fluorides, carbonates, oxalates, and phosphates are insoluble in wa ter. Among the halides only th e fluorides are insoluble. The addition of hydrofluoric acid or fluoride ions to RE3+ solutions even in 3M nitric acid results in the precipitation of REF3. This is a characteristic test for rare earth ions. Rare earths can also be precipitated as oxalates, another insoluble rare earth compound, from a dilute nitric acid solution. The precipitation is not only quantit ative, but also specific to rare earths and is used for the determination of ra re earths gravimetrically. Oxalate precipitation is also a useful procedure for rare earth purif ication. The oxalate is calcined to the oxide. Double slats of rare earths are common. Th e most important are the double nitrates 2RE(NO3)3·3MgNO3·24H2O and RE(NO3)3·2NH4NO3·4H2O, and the double sulfates RE2(SO4)3·3Na2SO4·12H2O and RE2(SO4)3·MgSO4·24H2O. The cerium group double sulfates are only sparingly soluble in sodium sulfate whereas those of the yttrium group are appreciably soluble. This characteristic makes it possible to achieve a fairly rapid separ- ation of the entire group of rare earths into two subgroups. 1.6.2 ComplexesThe formation of complex species is an importan t feature of tripositive rare earth ions. It is improbable, however, that any hybrid f orbitals from the ions would take part in covalent bonding, and the large size of the RE 3+ ions make it possible for only certain types of complexes to be formed (Moeller 1961). Thus, (i) the number of rare earth complexes is limited, (ii) only species that can attract the RE cations as a result of their own small size, large charge, and chelating abiliti es will yield complexes, (iii) stabilities of such complexes with respect to dissociation will be less than those of the tripositive transition metal ions,01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 26 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 27 and (iv) bonding in all complex species will be predominantly ionic. The coordination number is usually 7, 8, 9, or 10 and only in isolated cases it is 6. Properties that depend directly on the 4 f electrons are not affected by complexation. The complexes formed by tripositive rare earth ions include complexes with citric acid, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), and hydroxy ethylene diamine tr iacetic acid (HEDTA). The most important of the chelates are the species derived fro m the various polyamine polycarboxylic acids. Many of these have been isolated and characterized. These complexes are water soluble. However, the stabilities of the species in solution are of great importance because differences in the stabilities of the comple xes have been used in conjunction with ion exchange techniques to effect separation of rare earths from one another (Powell 1979, Powell 1961). The complex formation is pH de pendent and the stabilities of chelates are related to the ionic radii of the rare earth io n. The stabilities of complex species invariably increase from La3+ to Eu3+ or Gd3+ but for cations heavier than gadolinium, the stability may continue to increase, remain nearly constant, or pass through a maximum (Moeller 1967). 1.6.3 The Tetravalent State Cerium(IV) is the only tetrapositive rare earth species that is stable in aqueous solution as well as in solid compounds (Moeller 1961). The III and IV valency states of cerium are often designated as cerous and ceric , respectively. The ceric oxide, CeO2, hydrous ceric oxide, CeO2.nH2O, and ceric fluoride, CeF4, are the only binary solid compounds of Ce(IV). Ceric oxide is obtained by heating cerium metal, Ce(OH)3, or any of the several Ce(III) oxosalts such as the oxalate, nitrat e, or carbonate in air or oxygen. CeO2, white when pure, is quite inert and no t attacked by even strong acid s or alkalies. It can, however, be dissolved by acids in the presence of reduc ing agents to form Ce(III) solutions. Hydrous CeO2.nH2O can be obtained as a yellow gelatino us precipitate, from Ce(IV) solutions on treatment with bases. The hydroxide is pr ecipitated at pH 1. Ceric fluoride, CeF4, is prepared by reacting anhydrous CeCl3 or CeF3 with fluorine at room temperature. Ceric fluoride is inert to cold water and is reduced to CeF3 by hydrogen at 200–300°C. Ce(IV) is obtained in solution by treatment of Ce(III) solution with strong oxidizing agents like ozone, peroxodisulfate, or bismutha te in nitric acid. Under alkaline conditions, oxidation of cerium to +4 stat e is readily effected by OC1–, H2O2, and O2. In solutions, Ce(IV) can also be obtained by electrolyt ic oxidation. Cerium(IV) forms phosphates insoluble in 4NHNO3 and iodates insoluble in 6NHNO3 as well as insoluble oxalate. Precipitation as phosphate or iodate can be used to separate Ce(IV) from trivalent rare earths. Ce(IV) is extracted more readily than the RE(III) ions into organic solvents like tributyl phosphate. Ce(IV) can be used as an oxidizing agent. Ceric oxide dissolves, undergoing reduction, in acids such as hydrochloric acid. In acidic medium, reduction of cerium (IV) is effected by many reductants such as Fe2+, Sn2+, I–, and H2O2. It dissolves in oxidizing acids such as nitric acid or sulfuric acid without undergoing reduction. The double ammonium nitrite of Ce(IV), the orange red soluble Ce(NO3)4.2NH4NO3, crystallizes readily from a concentrat ed nitric acid solution. It is both an excellent source of Ce(IV) and a useful analytical oxidizing agent. Pr(IV) is a powerful oxidizing agent and oxidi zes water itself. Therefore, it does not exist in aqueous solution. When Pr(III) salt or oxide is heated in air, Pr6O11 forms. Both Pr(III) and Pr(IV) are present in the oxide.01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 27 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 28 The chemistry of Tb(IV) is similar to that of Pr(IV). The oxide Tb4O7 is obtained on igniting Tb(III) oxosalts in air. Tb4O7 contains both Tb(III) and Tb(IV). TbO2 is obtained by oxidation of Tb2O3 with atomic oxygen at 450°C. The colorless compound TbF4 is obtained by treating TbF3 with gaseous fluorine at 300–400°C. 1.6.4 The Divalent State The divalent state of Sm, Eu, and Yb are well established both in solution and solid com- pounds. These species are obtained (Moeller 1967) by (i) thermal reduction of anhydrous halides or chalcogenides with metals or hydro gen. For example, solid oxide, chalcogenides, halides, carbonate, or phosphate of europium (II) may be obtained by reduction of the corresponding Eu(III) compound or from EuCl2 by metathesis, (ii) electrolytic reduction in aqueous solution or in halide melts, for exam ple, Eu(II) and Yb(II), (iii) chemical reduction in solution: Eu(II) using Zn in aqueous soluti on, Sm(II) using Mg in ethanol, (iv) thermal decomposition of anhydrous triiodides, and (v) controlled oxidation of free metals or their amalgams. The divalent rare earth cations are strong reducing agents in acidic aqueous solutions and their reducing ability decreases in the order Sm2+> >Yb2+> >Eu2+. Both Sm2+and Yb2+ undergo instant oxidation to the tripositive species by the hydronium ion and also by air. The oxidation of Eu2+ is, however, slower and solutions containing Eu2+ can be readily handled. In acidic solution, all three ions ar e rapidly oxidized by elemental oxygen. The RE2+ ions resemble Group II ions, particularly Ba2+. Thus the hydroxides are soluble and sulfates are insoluble. Eu3+ can be readily separated from the other rare earths by reduction with zinc to the dipositive state followed by the precipitation of the remaining tripositive rare earths as hydroxides by carbonate free ammonia. The water insoluble compounds, sul- fates, carbonates, or fluorides of the divalent io ns are relatively more resistant to oxidation. These ions have little tendency, compared to Ba2+ or Sr2+, to form complex compounds. 1.7 APPLICATIONS The rare earths have an ever growing variet y of applications in the modern technology. They provide many an industry with crucial materials, and they provide many a customer with benefits (Molycorp Inc., 1993). The fi rst application of the rare earths and the beginning of the rare earth industry date back to 1891 and were related to the inventions of the Austrian entrepreneur and scientist Carl Auer von Welsbach. He used the rare earths to solve what was at that time a major technical problem — the production of bright light. It was already known that a solid of suitable composition and large surface area when brought into the hot zone of a gas flame would glow, gi ving off the required bright light. The hitch was finding the suitable solid that would be the incandescent mantle. Auer solved the problem. First, he announced in 1866 the disc overy of a gas mantle composed of zirconia doped with lanthana. That mantle was too brittle and produced cold blue light. Later, after persistent experimentation, Auer came up in 1891 with a gas mantle composed of 99% thoria and 1% ceria. The light from this mant le was not only white and bright and superior to electric light, but it was also cheaper. Th is situation remained for several decades until about 1935 and an estimated (Greinacher 1981 ) five billion gas mantles had been produced01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 28 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 29 and consumed in the world. The Auer mantle was produced by a simple process. A cotton sock was saturated with a salt solution which upon ignition resulted in a mixture of thorium–cerium oxides with large surface area. Even today, light production from gas mantles remains in use in remote areas where electricity is unavailable or erratic and in some railroad signal devices. The next important application of the rare earths also came from Auer’s inventions. The search for a simple ignition system for hi s gas mantle lamps led him to discover in 1903 a pyrophoric alloy called flintstone. Production of flintstones was the first major large scale use for rare earth metals which began in 1903 . The flintstone, which is composed of 70% misch metal and 30% iron, was used in the lighters for the gas mantle. The name “mischmetal” was coined by Auer for the alloy which contained lanthanum, cerium and didymium in the proportion in which they occurred in monazite. To produce misch metal, Auer founded in 1907 a company at Karinthia in Austria. The company came to be known as Trei-bacher Chemische Werke and was the first comp any involved in the commercial production of rare earths. Auer used the fused salt el ectrolysis method for the production of misch metal, and in 1908 over 800 kgs of misch me tal–iron flints entered the market. Following Auer’s discovery, production of lighter flints was started in about 1915 by Ronson Metals in the United States. Greinacher (1981) has noted that in the 22 years between 1908 and 1930, about 1,100 to 1,400 metric tons of flints were produced from approximately 1,300 to 1,800 metric tons of rare earth oxides in the form of rare earth chlorides. During the same time, about 7,500 metric tons of thorium nitrate were used fo r Auer incandescent mantles. The lighter flints are still very common and account for the co nsumption of a substantial fraction of the misch metal produced. Pyrophoric alloys, which give tracer shells their distinctive fiery trail, also contain misch metal as a constituent. The production of intense light by electric arc was developed by Beck in Germany in These electric arc lamps have been us ed for a wide range of lighting purposes, including search lights and for cinema projector s. Historically, the third major use of rare earths was the addition of rare earth fluoride as a wick in arc light carbons (Greinacher1981). Even though the electri c arc struck and maintained between carbon electrodes emits light, it is low in intensity. The brightness is greatly increased if a cored carbon, consisting of an outer shell of carbon and inner core made from carbon flour mixed with rare earth oxides and fluorides, is used. The enhanced brightness and color comes about because of the characteristic emission spectra of the core material (Bagchi 1988). From these beginnings, and over many years, industrial applications of rare earths have developed in metallurgy, magnets, cera mics, electronics, chemical, optical, medical, nuclear technologies (Gschneidner 1981). The major uses of rare earths are summarized in Table 1.3. 1.7.1 Metallurgy Rare earths have major applications as metall urgical alloys. The oldest of these alloys is misch metal which is, as mentioned earlier, an alloy consisting only of rare earth metals, with the individual rare earth elements pr esent in the same proportion in which they naturally occur in bastnasite or monazite. Misch metal is the form in which the rare earths were introduced as constituents in numerous al loys for a variety of a pplications. A selection of alloys that benefit from rare earth additions is described below. 01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 29 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 30 Table 1.3 Applications of rare earths Rare Earth Applications RARE EARTHS Rare earth primary products are mainly used as raw materials for high-purity individual rare earth chemicals, and in the making of petroleum and environ- ment protection catalysts, misch metal, and polishing powders LANTHANUM Lanthanum-rich rare earth compounds have been extensively used as compon- ents in FCC catalysts, especially in th e manufacture of low-octane fuel from heavy crude oil. Lanthanum-rich rare earth metals have an important role in hydrogen storage batteries. Lanthanum is utilized in green phosphors based on the aluminate (La0.4Ce0.45Tb0.15)PO4. Lanthanide zirconates are used for their catalytic and conductivity properties and lanthanum stabilized zirconiahas useful electronic and mechanical properties. Lanthanum is utilized in lasercrystals based on the yttrium–lant hanum–fluoride (YLF) composition. CERIUM Commercial applications of cerium are numerous and include glass and glass polishing, phosphors, ceramics, catalysts and metallurgy: In the glass industry, it is considered to be the most efficient glass polishing agent for precision optical polishing. It is also used to decolorize glass by keeping iron in its ferrous state. The ability of cerium-doped glass to block outultraviolet light is utilized in the manufacturing of medical glassware and aero- space windows. It is also used to prev ent polymers from darkening in sunlight and to suppress discoloration of televisi on glass. It is applied to optical com- ponents to improve performance.In phosphors, the role of cerium is not as the emitting atom, but as a “sensitizer.” Cerium is also used in a variety of ceramics, including dental compositions and as a phase stabilizer in zirconia-based products. Ceria plays several catalytic roles. In catalytic converters it acts as a stabilizer for the high surface area alumina, as a pr omoter of the water-gas shift reaction, as an oxygen storage component and as an enhancer of the NOX reduction capability of rhodium. Cerium is adde d to the dominant catalyst for the production of styrene from methylben zene to improve styrene formation. It is used in FCC catalysts containing zeol ites to provide both catalytic reactivity in the reactor and thermal stability in the regenerator. In steel manufacturing,it is used to remove free oxygen and sulfur by forming stable oxysulfides and by tying up undesirable trace elements, such as lead and antimony. PRASEODYMIUM It is highly valued for ceramics use as a bright yellow pigment, in praseody- mium doped zirconia, because of its optimum reflectance at 560 nm. Muchresearch is being done on its optical properties for use in amplification of telecommunication systems, including as a doping agent in fluoride fibers. It is also used in the scinti llator for medical CAT scans. NEODYMIUM Primary applications include la sers, glass coloring and tinting, dielectrics and, most importantly, neodymium–iron–boron (Nd 2Fe14B) permanent mag- nets. The neodymium-based magnet was first introduced in 1982 simultane-ously by Sumitomo Specialty Metals (Japan) and General Motors (U.S.) andcommercialized in 1986. It is used extensively in the automotive industry with many applications including starter motors, brake systems, seat adjusters and car stereo speakers. Its largest application is in the voice coil motors used in computer disk drives. Neodymium has a strong absorption band centered at 580 nm, which is very close to the human eye’s maximum level ofsensitivity making it useful in protectiv e lenses for welding goggles. It is also used in CRT displays to enhance contrast between reds and greens. It is highly valued in glass manufacturing for its a ttractive purple coloring to glass. Neo- dymium is included in many formulations of barium titanate, used as dielec- tric coatings and in multi-layer capaci tors essential to electronic equipment. Yttrium–aluminum–garnet (YAG) solid state lasers utilize neodymium 01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 30 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 31 because it has optimal absorption and emitting wavelengths. Nd-based YAG lasers are used in various medical applications, drilling, welding and materialprocessing. SAMARIUM Samarium is primarily utilized in the production of samarium–cobalt (Sm 2Co17) permanent magnets. It is also used in laser applications and for its dielectric properties. Samarium-cobalt magnets replaced the more expensiveplatinum–cobalt magnets in the early 1970s. While now overshadowed by the less expensive neodymium–iron–boron magn et, they are still valued for their ability to function at high temperatur es. They are utilized in lightweight electronic equipment where size or space is a limiting factor and where functionality at high temperature is a concern. Applications include electronic watches, aerospace equipment, microwave technology and servomotors. Because of its weak spectral absorption band samarium is used in the filter glass on Nd:YAG solid state lasers to surround the laser rod to improve efficiency by absorbing stray emissions.Samarium forms stable titanate com pounds with useful dielectric properties suitable for coatings and in capacitors at microwave frequencies. EUROPIUM Europium is utilized primarily for its unique luminescent behavior. Excitation of the europium atom by absorption of ultraviolet radiation can result in spe-cific energy level transitions within the atom creating an emission of visible radiation. In energy-efficient fluorescen t lighting, europium provides not only the necessary red, but also the blue. Several commercial red phosphors are based on europium for color TV, computer sc reens and fluorescent lamps. Its lumi- nescence is also valuable in medical, surgical and biochemical applications. GADOLINIUM Gadolinium is utilized for both its high magnetic moment and in phosphors and scintillated materials. When mixed with EDTA dopants, it is used as aninjectable contrast agent for patien ts undergoing magnetic resonance imaging. With its high magnetic moment, gadolinium can reduce relaxation times and thereby enhance signal intensity. Th e particularly stable half full 4 f electron shell with no low lying energy levels cr eates applications as an inert phosphor host. Gadolinium can therefore act as host for x-ray cassettes and in scintillated materials for computer tomography. TERBIUM Terbium is primarily used in phosp hors, particularly in fluorescent lamps and as the high intensity green emitter used in projection televisions, such as the yttrium–aluminum–garnet (Tb:YAG) variety. Terbium responds efficientlyto x-ray excitation and is, therefore, us ed as an x-ray phosphor. Terbium alloys are also used in magneto-optic recording films, such as TbFeCo. DYSPROSIUM Dysprosium is most commonly used as in neodymium-iron-boron high strength permanent magnets. While it has one of the highest magneticmoments of any of the rare earths, this has not resulted in an ability to perform on its own as a practical alternative to neodymium compositions. It is, however, now an essential additive in NdFeB production.It is also used in special ceramic co mpositions based on BaTiO formulations. HOLMIUM Holmium has the highest magnetic moment (10.6 µB) of any naturally occurring element. Because of this it has been used to create the highest known magnetic fields by placing it within high strength magnets as a pole piece or magnetic flux concentrator. This magnetic property also has value inyttrium–iron–garnet (YIG) lasers for microwave equipment. Holmium lasers at a human-eye safe 2.08 microns allowi ng its use in a variety of medical and dental applications in both yttrium–aluminum–garnet (YAG) andyttrium–lanthanum–fluoride (YLF) solid state lasers. The wavelength allowsfor use in silica fibers designed for shorter wavelengths while still providing the cutting strength of longer wavelength equipment. Table 1.3 Applications of rare earths (continued) 01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 31 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 32 Ductile Iron The rare earths played a leading part in the discovery and commercial- ization of nodular iron (Linebarger and Mc Cluhan 1981). Nodular iron has properties similar to mild steel and is essentially a du ctile cast iron. Nodular iron results when the graphite flakes in cast iron are converted to nodules. In the 1940s it was discovered thatERBIUM Erbium has application in glass colori ng, as an amplifier in fiber optics, and in lasers for medical and dental us e. The erbium ion has a very narrow absorption band coloring erbium salts pink. It is therefore used in eyeware and decorative glassware. It can neutrali ze discoloring impurities such as ferric ions and produce a neutral gray shade. It is used in a variety of glass products for this purpose. It is particularly usef ul as an amplifier for fiber optic data transfer. Lasers based on Er:YAG are idea lly suited for surgical applications because of its ability to deliver energy without thermal build-up in tissue. THULIUM Thulium products are mainly used in making crystals and lasers. An important application of thulium in the medicine area, and relatively independent of its high cost, is the production of portabl e x-ray sources. These sources are available for about one year, as tools in medical and dental diagnosis, as well as to detect defects in inaccessible mechanical and electronic components. This type of sources does not need excessive protection. Usually a small cap of lead is enough. Thulium can also be used in magnetic and ceramic materials (ferrite), similar to the yttrium–iron alloys, used in the microwave technologies. YTTERTBIUM Ytterbium is being used in numerous fiber amplifier and fiber optic techno- logies and in various lasing applicati ons. It has a single dominant absorption band at 985 in the infrared making it useful in silicon photocells to directly convert radiant energy to electricity. Ytterbium metal increases its electrical resistance when subjected to very high st resses. This property is used in stress gauges for monitoring ground deformations from earthquakes and nuclear explosions. It is also used as in thermal barrier syst em bond coatings on nickel, iron and other transition metal alloy substrates. LUTETIUM Lutetium is the last member of the ra re earth series. Unlike most rare earths it lacks a magnetic moment. It also has th e smallest metallic radius of any rare earth. It is perhaps the least naturally a bundant of the lanthanides. It is the ideal host for x-ray phosphors because it produces the densest known white material, lutetium tantalate (LuTaO4). It is utilized as a dopant in matching lattice parameters of certain substrate garnet crystals, such as indium–gallium– garnet (IGG) crystals due to its lack of a magnetic moment. YTTRIUM Yttrium has the highest thermodynamic affinity for oxygen of any element; this characteristic is the basis for many of its applications. Some of the applications of yttrium incl ude its use in ceramics as crucibles for molten reactive metals, in fluorescen t lighting phosphors, computer displays and automotive fuel consumption sensors. Yttria-stabilized zirconium oxide isused in high temperature applications, such as in thermal plasma sprays to protect aerospace component surfaces at high temperatures. Crystals of the yttrium–iron–garnet (YIG) variety are essential to microwave communication equipment. The phosphor Eu:Y 2O2S creates the red color in televisions. Crys- tals of the yttrium–aluminum–garnet (YAG) variety are utilized with neo- dymium in a number of laser applications . Yttria can also increase the strength of metallic alloys. SCANDIUM Scandium products are mainly used in ceramics, lasers, phosphors and in certain high performance alloysTable 1.3 Applications of rare earths(continued) 01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 32 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 33 spheroidal graphite could be routinely prod uced in the laboratory in irons containing 0.02% Ce. The rare earth elements cleanse the metal of elements that prohibit spherical graphite growth, and the compo unds they then form provide heterogeneous substrates for graphite nucleation. Its good physical and foundry properties have made nodular iron an attractive engineering material, partic ularly in the automotive industry. In the manufacture of nodular iron, rare ear ths are added as misch metal or mixed rare earth silicides and not as pure rare earth metals , mainly due to cost considerations (Davies 1981). Magnesium has emerged as a competitio n for rare earths for graphite nodularization in cast iron, threatening the continued use of misch metal for this purpose (Falconnet 1988). Steels The deleterious effect of sulfur on the mechanical properties of freshly cast steel is well known. Iron sulfides form and concen trate at the boundaries between the grains of steel formed on solidification. Such steels are very brittle and fracture on working. Addition of rare earths to steel causes the sulfur content to be captured in the form of very stable compounds such as RE2S3 or RE2S2O. These compounds tend to form globular or spherical inclusions that do not concentrate at the grain boundaries, thus greatly enhancing ductility (Luyckx 1981). The sulfides and oxysulfides are very stable at steel making temperatures and, unlike other sulfides such as those of manganese, they neither deform nor elongate under processing conditions. As the rare earth concentration is increased, MnS inclusions are displaced by rare earth oxysulfi des or sulfides. The stability of granular rare earth sulfides alleviates the detrimental eff ects of elongated MnS inclusions on toughness. Besides improvements in the toughness characteri stics of HSLA steels, rare earth additions also improve fatigue, creep, and several othe r mechanical properties (Collins et al. 1961, Linebarger and McCluhan 1981) of steels. The rare earths react quite efficiently with hydrogen in steel and also lower the hydrogen diffusion coefficient. Rare earths are added to steel as misch meta l, rare earth silicides (RE content 30%), and alloys such as Fe–Si–10 RE, Mg–Fe–Si–0.1 to 0.2 RE. The effect of rare earth metals in steels, in whichever form they are introdu ced, is the same, and the amount of misch metal usually added to ferrous alloys is about 0. 1 to 0.2%. Such small additions do lead to considerable beneficial effects in both nodula r iron and steels. Starti ng in the late 1960s, rare earth additions to steel in the form s mentioned above became a widely accepted practice. The practice of adding rare earths to steel was reviewed by Wauby (1978). A few kilograms of misch metal were added to each metric ton of special steel used in the manufacture of an Alaska oil pipeline because misch metal improves the physical properties of steel under arctic conditions. Becau se of its use in the Alaska pipeline steel, a major increase in demand occurred for misch metal in the period 1971–1978. In spite of the fact that the major consumption of rare earth s is in the iron and steel industry, the annual tonnage of that industry that is treated with lanthanides had indeed b een very small (Haskin and Paster 1979). The use of rare earths in the form of rare earth silicides or misch metal in steels grew explosively in the 1970s and peak ed around 1975. Since then the market for rare earth products dropped off, following the availability of cleaner steel and the use of calcium for ultimate desulfurization (Falconnet 1988). Superalloys In the early 1960s, researchers at General Electric discovered that stain- less steel containing both aluminum and y ttrium possessed exceptional high temperature corrosion resistance. Beginning then and until about 1975, these alloys were produced for limited application in the nuclear industry (D avies 1981). This alloy, known as “fecralloy” to denote the presence of Fe, Cr, Al, and Y in it, has since been widely adopted for the fabri- cation of furnace heating elements and has been considered as a replacement for ceramic substrates in emission control catalysts for th e automobile industry. Lanthanum is also used01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 33 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 34 in high temperature iron based alloys (Davie s 1981). An alloy with 200 ppm lanthanum combines oxidation resistance to 1,100°C with good ductil ity and ease of fabrication. Superalloys are essentially a class of heat-re sistant alloys used in gas turbine engines, electric generators, jet engine exhaust nozzles, r eaction vessels and, in general, as materials in intense high-temperature oxidizing environm ents. Certain rare earth elements are added to superalloys. Essentially, the rare earth elements are added to enhance their oxidation resistance. Yttrium is the active component in the M–Cr–Al –Y (Fe–Cr–Al–Y, Ni–Cr–Al–Y, Co–Cr–Al–Y) family of superalloys. The stability of alumina–chromiaskin is enhanced by traces of yttrium. The al loys, even when applied by vapor deposition, form an oxide coating that exhibits remarkable adhesion because yttrium acts to prevent the formation of voids at the oxide/substrate interface. Lanthanum and cerium also play a similar role in certain nickel and cobalt supera lloy compositions. Cerium is used in amounts ranging from 100 to 300 ppm in certain high stre ngth nickel alloys to control sulfur and oxygen. Typically 200 to 400 ppm of lanthanu m are added in nickel base and cobalt base high temperature alloys for gas turbine se rvice. For example, lanthanum raises the operating temperature of nickel base Hast elloy-K from about 950°C to about 1,100°C. Without lanthanum, these alloys exhibit less resistance to cyclic oxidation, and lanthanum probably results in a firmly bound oxide la yer. Misch metal in small concentrations (0.03–0.05%) added to electrical resistance al loys such as Ni–20 Cr causes the formation of dense and more adherent surface oxides, lead ing to a tenfold increase in service life, from 1,000 to about 10,000 h. The addition of cerium to the Cu78 high temperature aerospace alloy (Al–8Fe–4Ce) of Alcoa for en hancing its oxidation resistance was stated as the first major industrial use of cerium metal. Usually, less than 1 wt % of rare earthsadded in the form of individual metal leads to dramatic improvements in the performance of these superalloys. Magnesium Alloys The beneficial effects of the addition of rare earths to magnesium alloys were discovered in the late 1930s by Haughten and Prytherch (1937). Sauerwald (1947) discovered the exceptional grain re fining action of zirconium in magnesium. Murphy and Payne (1947) showed that the rare earth additives are compatible with zirconium, and enhanced properties could be ob tained by incorporating both rare earths and zirconium. Subsequently, zinc (Emley 1966) or silver were also included as desirable additives to these alloys. At high temperatures, as compared with conventional magnesium alloys, magnesium alloys containing about 3% misch metal and 1% Zr show enhanced creep strength (Kremers 1961). Significantly higher strength at all te mperatures was obtained by using Di(Nd + Pr) in place of misch metal as the alloying constituent. The new generation magnesium alloyscontain individual rare earths. One of the two magnesium alloys for use in high performance engines for aircraft, space rockets, and satellites, possibly as castings, contains 4% zinc and 1% misch metal and can be used in applications seeing temperatures as high as 160°C. The other, which contains 5.5% yttrium, 3.5% other rare earths, and 0.5% zirconium, is stable at temperatures up to 280°C (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). A Mg–Al– Zn–Nd alloy has good corrosion resist ance in an aqueous saline solution and a Mg–Y– Nd–Zr alloy was shown to have good corrosion resistance, good castability, and stability up to 300°C. Rare earths refine the grain, improve strength, ductility, tough- ness, weldability, machinability, and co rrosion resistance in the host alloy. Improving upon the commercially available Mg–Y–Nd–Zr alloy, a lower weight high creep resistance quarternary alloy co nsisting of Mg–Sc–Mg–Zr has been developed by researchers at TU Clausthal, Germany (Hedrick, 2001).01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 34 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 35 It has also been found that a melt spun amorphous magnesium alloy containing 10 at % cerium and 10 at % nickel has good duct ility, and in addition, a tensile fracture strength more than twice as large as conventional optimum age hardened alloy. Aluminum Alloys A small amount of yttrium (100 ppm) in combination with zirco- nium was found to increase (by 50%) the co nductivity of aluminum transmission lines (Davies 1981). The addition of misch metal to aluminum base alloys used for high tension transmission line has led to improved tensile strength, heat resistance, vibration resistance, corrosion resistance, and extrudability. An yttrium–magnesium– aluminum alloy has been developed in China for transm ission cabling (McGill 1997). The aluminum alloys 22Si–1MM and 2.5Cu–1.5Ni–0.8Mg–1.2Fe–1.2Si–0.15MM possess good high temperature properties and fatigue strength and ar e used in automobile industry, air craft, small engine, and othe r fields. A new aluminum alloy composed of aluminum, iron, and cerium is also unde r development as a replacement for titanium components in specific applications in the ra nge of 90 to 315°C. Cerium imparts the required corrosion resistance at elevated te mperatures (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). Significant improvements in high strength Al –Mg and Al–Li alloys have been obtained by the addition of scandium (McGill 1997). The addition of scandium to aluminum incr eases the yield strength as it reduces the grain size. The scandium aluminum alloy has b een used in a premier line of baseball and softball bats. The high strength alloy allows the bats to have thinner walls, less weight and greater rebound (Hedrick 1997). A low density glassy alloy co ntaining about 90 at % Al, up to 9 at % transition metals and about 5 at % rare earths has been under development (Kilbourn 1988). The transition metals considered were iron, cobalt, and ni ckel and the rare earths were cerium, neo- dymium, and yttrium. These materials, prod uced by melt spinning, have extremely high tensile strengths, about twice that of the best crystalline commercial alloy, good ductility in addition to low density. These characteristics are attrac tive for aerospace applications. An Al–8 wt % Fe–4 wt % Ce alloy was made by the rapid solidification (RS) technique of melt spinning and processed fu rther by powder metallurgy techniques. These alloys rely on the rapid gettering of oxygen by the rare earth. The stability of dispersed oxide particles thus formed improve the high temperature performance of the alloys (Kilbourn 1988), particularly creep resist ance, elevated temperature tensile strength, thermal stability, and corrosion resistance. Comp ared to the heat-treatable ingot metallurgy products whose elevated temperature proper ties are limited to 175°C, the RS Al–Fe–Ce alloys retain good strength even up to 340°C. About 1 to 3% misch metal in aluminum– carbon composite improves the wetting by carbon and hence the incorporation of graphite dispersoid in the meta l matrix, resulting in a material with improved tensile strength. Titanium Alloys Yttrium, in concentrations of approximately 200 ppm, was found to improve ductility and ease of fabrication of vacuum arc melted titanium alloys (Davies 1981). Microalloying of various commercial titanium alloys with rare earths has also resulted in improved strength, stress rupture, and oxidation resistance. Rapidly solidified titanium alloys (the rare earth addition, particularly Y, Nd, Er, or Ce ranged from 1 to 2%) showed improvements by orders of magnitude in high tem- perature yield strength, stress rupture life, and creep resistan ce. The most important of the rare earth additives have been those with erbium or yttrium (Mahajan and Rama Rao 1988). Copper Alloys The addition of misch metal or yttrium to oxygen-free high conductiv- ity (OFHC) copper enhances oxidation resistance without af fecting electrical conductivity.01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 35 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 36 For example, the oxidation resistance nearly doubled at 600°C when 0.1 wt % Y was added to the copper. Misch metal additions have been used to improve the hot workability and deep drawing characteristics of bronzes containi ng less than 1 wt % lead, and also the wear resistance of highly leaded bronzes. Adding misch metal in leaded bearing bronze reduced the coefficient of frictio n by a factor of four. Zinc Alloys Misch metal is a constituent in the alloy Galfan (Zn–5% Al–0.05% MM) used in galvanizing baths. This alloy, deve loped by the International Lead–Zinc Research Organization, is superior with respect to corrosion resistance and permeability to standard galvanized steel sheet and wire of equal coat ing thickness and has comparable paintability and weldability properties (R adtke and Herrschaft 1983). Oxide Dispersion Strengthened (ODS) Alloys In ODS alloys the high thermal stability of the rare earth oxides such as Y2O3, CeO2 impart desirable properties like high temperature strength, creep resistance, and resistance to cyclic corrosive oxidation (Kilbourn 1988). Yttria (0.25 to 1.3%) is introduced into the nickel–chromium and iron–chromium alloys by mechanical alloying . The mechanical alloying is a high energy ball milling process that permits solid-stat e processing and results in the biggest improvement in properties. After mechanical alloying, the alloy powder is processed by powder metallurgy techniques. The products are high temperature high strength ODS alloys, which have found use in gas tu rbine blades, combustors, and other such applications. Long Range Ordered Alloys Long range ordered alloys such as (Fe,Co)3V, (Fe, Ni)3V, and (Fe, Co, Ni)3V have been materials with potential for high temperature applications. The addition of a small amount of Ce (<0.1% ) together with titanium has been found to double the rupture ductility, substantially lower the creep ra te, and considerably improve the rupture life of some of these alloys (Mahajan and Rama Rao 1988). In another application, mixtures containing Zr, Ce, and Y oxides of controlled particle morphology are plasma sprayed onto the metal surfaces to create barrier coatings for the protection of the metal substrates against hi gh temperature degradation. 1.7.2 Magnets Among the numerous applications of the rare earths, one of the most spectacular has been their use in the new generation permanent magnets. In the late 1960s, samarium alloyed with cobalt was first used in magnets, an d in the 1980s the cheaper and more powerful neodymium–iron–cobalt magnets also became available (Wernick 1995). Sintered magnets of the SmCo5 type, the first of the rare earth magnets to be available commercially, possess specific magnetic proper ties much superior to the well-known and hitherto well-established ferrite and alnico magnets. This is shown by values in Table 1.4. The intermetallic SmCo5, because of its hexagonal structure, exhibits a high degree of uni- axial anisotropy, resulting in ex tremely high coercivity, which in turn results in consider- ably greater energy product. The magnetic strength of Sm–Co compound s is predominantly from the cobalt atoms. Samarium apparently helps define an anisot ropic structure “locking” the cobalt moments in place and rendering demagneti zation difficult (Molycorp, 1993). The rare earth cobalt magnets can be ex tremely short and still provide adequate magnetizing force. The superior properties of rare earth magnets not only permitted01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 36 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 37 extensive miniaturization in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products, but also resulted in performance characteristics hither to unattainable. The products in which rare earth magnets have been or are used include wrist watches, “hi-fi” equipment, high power DC motors, magnetic bearings, computer pe ripherals, microwave tubes, and so on. Both samarium and cobalt are expensive an d limited in supply and this made the SmCo5 magnets expensive. The disadvantage of th e high cost of samarium was sought to be offset by using misch metal in its place. The use of misch metal offers significant cost reduction particularly for large volume appli cations such as in electric machinery. The theoretical energy product of PrCo5 is 30% higher than that of SmCo5 but PrCo5 has substantially weaker anisotr opy compared with SmCo5 (Wallace et al. 1988). Praseo- dymium, which is more abundant than samari um was considered to replace Sm in SmCo5 materials (Kilbourn 1988). The use of praseody mium in magnets would give it application in a quantity it has never had before. A new generation of samarium–cobalt magnets that not only permitted savings in raw material costs but also provided enhanced magn etic properties was based on the 2:17 alloy, Sm2Co17. The most widely used of the 2:17 alloys are of the type Sm(Co, Cu, Fe, M)x, where M = Zr, Hf, or Ti, and x is in the range 7.0 to 7.85. These magnets have found use, particularly in Japan, as stepping motors for quartz analog watches, in high performance audio pick ups, and loudspeakers. The discovery of Nd2Fe14B magnets in 1984 ushered in a new era for the rare earth – transition metal based permanent magnets. The Nd–Fe–B magnets are high strength magnets with a magnetic energy of up to 50 MGOe, which is a factor 2.5 times greater than that of SmCo5 magnets, with high remanence and coercive force. The highest magnetic strength commercial product availa ble is rated at 42 MGOe (Hedrick 2001). There is a large potential for these magnets because iron, which is cheap and available in abundance (unlike the scarce and costly cobalt) , is present as the main constituent (82.4 at %). Neodymium is also in ample supply, be ing the third most abundant rare earth and constituting 13% of bastnasite and 18.5% of monazite ores.Table 1.4 Some properties of commercially available conventional and rare earth magnets Magnet Properties (BH)max, kJ/m3Br, T HcB, kA/m HcJ, kA/m Tc,°C Barium ferrite Plastic bonded Sintered18250.2450.365175175207180450450 AlNiCo Cast 35 1.15 50 50 860 SmCo 5 Plastic bonded Sintered60 1800.5700.950390720600 1800725725 Sm 2Co17 Sintered 210 1.050 770 1635 775 NdFeB Plastic bonded Sintered80 2500.6801.17546082582096034031001 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 37 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 38 Nd–Fe–B magnets have extensively penetrat ed commercial markets. Initially used in Japan in data processing and audio-visual equipment in nonextreme thermal environ- ments, their first large scale application was linked with the substitution of ferrite magnets by Nd–Fe–B magnets in small electric motors of automobiles, an application pioneered by General Motors. Another use of Nd magnets lies in the medical applications such as magnetic resonance imaging equipment. The worldwide production of neodymium magnets is and will be driven strongly by the electronic industry (especially the manufacture of computers and portable de vices like cellular phones) as well as by automotive and industrial applications. Starting in about 1985, rare earth metal demand was greatest for neodymium metal used in high strength permanent magnet alloys (Hedrick 1997). World production of Nd–Fe–B magnets in 1999 was 13500 t for sintered magnets and 2740 t for bonded magnets (Hedrick 2000). Since 1990, the demand and hence production was gaining at 28.6% per year for the sintered and 25.7% for the bonded. The NdFeB magnet applications, currently growing at 15% overall annual growth rate (Tourre 1998) are roughly as follows: motors in elec tronics, particularly hard disc drive (HDD) applications are 69% of the global market, automotive and appliance motors constitute 14%, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) anot her 10% and other applications, especially acoustics, make up the remaining 7%. It was anticipated that with neodymium in ample supply the neodymium magnet cost would drop to a level where it would replace not only the Sm–Co magnets, but also theAlNiCo. The main limitation of the Nd–Fe–B magnets is their lower Curie temperature(about 300°C). This leaves the field open for Sm–Co magnets (Curie temperature 700 to 900°C) for uses where this pr operty is of major importance. The coercivity of Nd–Fe–B high strength permanent magnets is enhanced by using Dy as an additive. Dysporium probably su bstitutes into the magnetic phase, creating Nd 2–xDyxFe14B with higher anisotropy (hence higher coercivity) than the unsubstituted material (Molycorp, 1993). The continuing search for new permanent magnet materials has led to the emergence of certain rare earth–iron intermetallic compo unds modified by inters titials such as nitro- gen and carbon, such as Sm2Fe17N≈3 (Coey et al. 1991). Interstitial modification has been found to bring in advantages like an increas e in Curie temperature and development of a strong uniaxial anisotropy (Collocott et al. 1999). 1.7.3 Terfenol Magnetostriction is a property exhibited by certain materials and these materials are known as magnetostrictive materials. A magnetic fiel d applied to a magnetostrictive material makes it expand or contract and, conversely, when stre ss is applied to the magnetostrictive material, a magnetic pulse is generated. The property of magnetostriction was discovered in 1971 but it took another 15 years before commercial application of the phenomenon became possible with the development of suitable materials (Jil es 1994). Iron alloys of rare earths such as Tb, Sm, and Dy exhibit properties of very large magnetostriction and find application as transducers for the conversion of magnetic pu lse to mechanical energy. The Laves phase alloy Tb0.3Dy0.7Fe1.9 (terfenol-D) in particular shows outstanding magnetostrictive properties and has attracted much attention for development (Clark 1979). The magneto- striction in an applied field ex hibited by terfenol is approximat ely 100 times larger than that of nickel, the well-known metal exhibiting magnetostriction. Terfenol changes dimension01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 38 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 39 in a magnetic field instantaneously and this ef fect is essentially at the heart of advanced transducers and micropositioners. The uses of te rfenol are also in areas of high power actua- tors, acoustic devices, broad-band sonar devices , micropositioners, fluid control valves and micropumps (Gschneidner an d Daane 1988, McGill 1997). Terfenol-D was also slated for use as the sma ll material to control fluid flow in natural gas fuel injection in light duty diesel engines (Hedrick, 2000). Dysporium–terbium–iron magnetostrictive al loys are also being developed for use as actuators to allow precision positioning of the next generation space telescope (NGST). This use is based on the alloys ’ ability to expand and contr act accurately when subjected to a magnetic field (Hedrick 1998). Incidenta lly, NGST would have 6 to 12 times the surface area of the Hubble space telescope. 1.7.4 Magnetic Refrigeration Gadolinium metal and alloys have been cons idered as the working substance in magnetic refrigeration cycles (Hashimoto et al. 19 81). The underlying principle of magnetic refrigeration is that a gadolinium-based solid h eats up in a strong magnetic field and cools when removed from the field. This system work s even at room temperature but has greatest prospects in cryogenic applications. Initia lly GdPd was used, and later the gadolinium aluminum garnet (GAG) single crystal and intermetallics (Dy0.5Er0.5)Al2 and TbNiO2 were used as magnetic refrigerants for cooling to as low as 4 K. The refrigerator using the mag- netic refrigerant is called the active magnetic regenerative magnetic refrigerator AMR-MK (Hedrick 1985a). The main advantages of th e magnetic refrigerator are the compactness and large refrigeration power per unit volume. It is also reliable, vibration free, and more efficient than most cryogenic cooling systems particularly below liquid nitrogen tempera- ture (77 K). The novel magnetic properties of 141Pr nuclei find use in a nuclear demagneti- zation refrigerator (Mueller et al. 1980). The intermetallic PrNi5 has been used to obtain temperatures as low as 27 µK in conjunction with nuclear magnetic cooling of copper. Gschneidner et al. (1999) have reported tw o major breakthroughs in magnetic refrig- eration. They successfully demonstrated that sub-room temperature magnetic refrigeration is a viable and competitive technology vis-a-vis conven tional gas cycle compression/ expansion refrigeration. In a laboratory protot ype refrigerator using 3 kg of Gd spheres as magnetic refrigerant in a magnetic field of 5 T, they achieved a cooling power of 600 watts,operating in a maximum temperature span of 30 K, while running the apparatus for more than 1,200 h over a 10-month period. They also reported the discovery of the giant magnetocalorific effect (MCE) materials Gd 5(SixGe1–x)4, which have MCEs ranging from 25 to 200% of better than the known prot otype magnetic refrigerants such as gadolinium. As an added attraction, their Curie temperat ures are tunable from 40 to 290 K by changing the Si to Ge ratio in this material. Thes e new materials can make magnetic refrigeration more efficient. Refrigeration systems based on the new material can have application in home and automobile air conditioning, and in household appliances like refrigerators, freezers and ice makers (Hedrick 1997). 1.7.5 Magnetooptic Materials Amorphous Tb25(Fe0.9Co0.1)75 thin films are RF or DC sputtered on a substrate and coated by a transparent ceramic film. A laser beam is used to write, read, or erase the information01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 39 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 40 on the amorphous alloy by making use of the Kerr rotation. Information storage densities, 15 to 50 times more than that usual in a conventional magnetic hard disc have been achieved. Gadolinium has been used in stead of terbium in this application. Information storage using cylindrical domains in a sheet of magnetized material was first reported in 1967. These domains were named bubble domains because they moved in a perturbing field much like bubbles move on a liquid surface. The stability of bubble domain is maximum when its diameter is approx imately equal to or more than the thickness of the magnetic sheet in which it is situat ed. A high packing density requires domain diameters of three micrometers or less. Hence, the magnetic material in the bubble domain memory must be a thin film supported by a subs trate. Rare earths are used in making bubble domain memories. The substrate is a non magnetic garnet, GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet), Gd3Ga15O12, usually prepared by the well-know n Czochralski, or pulling, tech- nique. Magnetic garnet films are deposited on this substrate and the typical composition of the film for micrometer diameter bubble is Y1.25Lu0.45Sm0.4Ca0.9Fe4.1Ge0.9O12. Both the substrate and the thin film in the bubble domain memory cont ain rare earths. The quantity of rare earths in the thin film is not very significant. However, substantial quantities of gadolinium have been consumed for making the substrates. 1.7.6 Ceramics Rare earth oxides, particularly ceria and yttria, are used as sintering aids in powder metallur- gical fabrication due to their ability to eliminate weakening voids (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). For instance, during the sintering of silicon nitride, the Si–Y–O–N liquid phase is formed. On cooling, the nitride grains regroup and the yttrium oxynitride cools into a micro- crystalline intergranular bond between the grai ns, and this resists crack development. The silicon nitride thus obtained is used in hot zone engine parts and high speed cutting tools. Yttria has a major use in the stabilizatio n of the high temperature cubic phase of zirconia. The stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is one of the best high temperature, high strength, and thermal shock resistant refractory compositi ons that is stable under many conditions of oxidation and reduction at elevated temperatur es. It has high thermal insulation properties and is used as a barrier coating to protect ho t parts in jet engines. Due to the presence of oxygen defects, YSZ has an electrical resistivit y that permits its use as an oxygen sensor in automobile exhaust systems. YSZ ha s also been adopted for use as SO2 sensor (Hedrick 2000). The concentration range of SO2 can be sensed from 1 ppm to 1000 ppm. An integral part of the emission control sy stem in automobiles is the exhaust oxygen sensor, which feeds back information for control of the air–fuel ratio. This is necessary to ensure that the exhaust gas composition is very near the stoichiometric point so that the catalytic converter system, which not only ox idizes the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the exhaust gases but also reduces the nitrou s oxide, operates efficiently (Kennard 1981). Stabilized zirconia is a key mate rial in this sensor. The stabil izers used are calcia, magnesia, or yttria. While calcia or magne sia stabilization has cost adva ntages, yttria stabilization results in better ionic conductivity. Ytterbia is still better but more expensive. Oxygen sensors based on yttria-stabilized zirconia also have use in industrial furnaces and in the measurement of oxygen content in molten glas s, molten steel, and other metals. They are also used in research in solid electrolyte ga lvanic cells. In medicine, YSZ is used for hip replacement parts, and in dentistry it is used fo r tooth filling. Yttria-stabilized zirconia has also been used as an electrode in the high temperature electrolysis of water. Yttria-stabilized01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 40 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 41 zirconia cells have been tested in certain adva nced space programs for the production of O2 from CO2 (McCallum 1998). The formation of solid solution of ceria with , for example, trivalent cations such as Y or La results in oxygen ion vacancies that are mobile. Oxygen diffusion is fast whereas the cation diffusion is slow. The defect fluorites then formed have good oxygen conductivity and are considered novel electro lytes for temperatures above ≈600°C. A long life (>5000 h) ceramic heating elemen t for use in air up to 1,900°C is based on La0.84Sr0.16CrO3. This material combines electrical c onductivity and structural rigidity in an oxidizing environment and has significantly extended the operating temperature range of compact furnaces in air. The electrical conductivity of CaCrO3 is fairly constant at around 0.1 ( Ω-cm)–1 in the range 500°C to 1900°C. The conductivity can be greatly increased by adding calcium and strontium at levels up to 20 mole % to give (LaM) CrO3. Further, the conductivity of Ca0.84Sr0.16CrO3, already > 2 ( Ω-cm)–1 at room temperature rises to > 10 ( Ω-cm)–1 above 300°C and remains close to this value up to 20 0°C. There are two important uses for (La,M) CrO3. One is as furnace heating elements. The most important use will be as the crucial inter-cell conducting material in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) (Minh 1993). Ceramic fuel cells, also called solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC’s) generate electricity directly from the reaction of a fuel with an oxidant. Power is produced electrochemically by passing a hydrogen-rich fuel over the anod e and air over the cathode and separating the two by an electrolyte. In producing electricity, the only byproducts of SOFC are heat, water and CO2. A current government-industry partnership program in U.S.A. is aiming to ready a 1-megawatt fuel cell micro turbine power pl ant. These cells operate at 1000°C. LaMnO3 is a P type conductor and Sr-doped LaMnO3 has a high electronic conductivity in oxidizing atmospheres. It is the preferred cathode materi al for use in severe conditions of SOFC’s. Another perovskite, (La,M) CoO3, has properties to be considered for use as possible catalytically active electrodes stable in high temperature aggressive environments for fuel cells and sensors (Molycorp 1993). Many application possibilities have been indicated (McGill 1997) for rare earths in ceramics. These include the use of La2O3, Y2O3, and CeO2 with Ni, Co, Cr or Zn as electrodes in fuel cells with zirconia–ytt ria solid electrolyte, and the use of LaCrO3 and LaCoO3 electrodes in magnetohydrodynamic gene rators. Rare earths containing perov- skites have been considered for certain cat alytic applications (Gunasekaran 1988). In fact rare earth perovskites, represented generally by REMO3 where M is a transition metal, are of continuing interest in many developing technologies. These are electrocata- lysis, high temperature electrodes and electro lytes, and membranes for gas separation and sensors (Molycorp 1993). The wide range of application also results from potential for possible fine tuning of st ructure in these compounds. Pure cerium oxide has been used as opacifi er in ceramic glazes (Greinacher 1981). In the 1960s, praseodymium (Pr6O11, 90%) was used with zirconium oxide, in the ratio ZrO2, 62–64%; SiO2, 32–33%; Pr6O11, 3–6% (Kudo 1988), as a beautiful yellow pigment in ceramics. Praseodymium is built into the zirconium silicate lat tice and thereby results in the full optical splendor. The praseodymium pi gment is stable at high temperatures. Cerium sulfide, CeS, and also yttria are al so used as materials for making crucibles besides being used as high temperature mate rials (McGill 1993). CeS has one of the most negative free energies of formation for sulphi des and has been proposed as a containment material for very reactive molten metals su ch as uranium and titanium (Krikorian and01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 41 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 42 Curtis, 1988). CeS has electrical conductivity like metal, high thermal conductivity, high melting point (2442°C), good th ermal shock resistance and is also machinable like a metal (Molycorp, 1993). Samarium, europium, gado linium, and dysprosium oxides are used in the nuclear industry in radiation-shielding cer amic compositions. Rare earths (Eu, Sm, Ce) oxides have also been used to improve light fa stness of lead chromate and titanium dioxide pigments and also to impart natura l fluorescence to artificial teeth. In 1971, Heartling and Land (1971) first repo rted achieving optical transparency in a ferroelectric ceramic material, lanthanum modi fied lead zirconate titanate (PLZT) solid solution. The PLZT ceramics (Pb1–xLax(Zr1–yTiy)O3) have interesting applications in military and industrial devices. These applicat ions include use in thermal/flash protection goggles, data display recorders, stereovi ewing systems, eye safety devices such as electronic welding helmets, and in image st orage devices (Heartling 1981). The basic operation of these devices relies on the change in the optical properties of the ceramic with the strength and direction of electric field ap plied to it, and the changes are brought about rapidly. The use of PLZT as electromech anical transducers and their piezoelectrical properties have also been studied (McGill 1993) . The rare earth used in these applications is lanthanum, and the PLZT is made by co nventional ceramic fabrication methods of hot pressing and polishing. Remarkable effects on optical transparency are achieved when the amount of lanthanum exceeds 7 at % in the ceramic. The attractive thermionic properties of LaB6 were identified by Laferty (1951) at General Electric Company, U.S.A. This comp ound, with the melti ng point above 2,500°C, also has a low vapor pressure, low work fu nction, and excellent thermionic emission current. It is superior to tungsten but is more expensive. It is used in the electron gun of electron microscopes where high electro n intensities are very desirable. More than any other material LaB6 shows resistance to att ack by aggressive fluorine at very high temperatures. This property l eads to many strategic applications involving fluorine gas. The resistance is conferred by the formation of an adherent fluoride film on the boride (Molycorp 1993, Holocombe et al. 1982). Researchers in China have noted that when rare earths are incorporated in a cemented carbide, a 50 to 100% improvement in carbide tool life was observed. The improvement is, however, dependent on both the rare earth us ed and how it is incorporated in the mixture. (Hedrick 2001). 1.7.7 Electronics The hexaborides of rare earths are a unique elec tric resistor material that has near zero temperature coefficient of resistance, a featur e not provided by metals. Formation of glass frits and LaB6 can be screen printed and fired to pr ovide resistor components required in modern integrated circuitry (Molycorp 1993). Rare earth materials find use in electronic devices that convert one form of energy to another (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). Both input and output are electricity in some cases, but the output variance is determined by thermal or radiation energy. The rare earths in these materials are added to synthetic garnet crystals such as yttrium–iron, yttrium–aluminum, and gadolinium–galliu m. Yttrium–iron garnets or YIGs (Y3Fe5O12) have found important uses in reactor and co mmunication devices. Yttrium and gadolinium are also used in garnets for microwave app lications. Besides use as microwave filters, yttrium aluminum garnet or YAG, (Y3Al5O12) crystals when doped with small quantities of neodymium or erbium can be used for lase rs. The YAG single crystal has many desirable01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 42 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 43 properties for use in high power solid state lase rs. It is hard and optically isotropic and has sites suitable for trivalent rare earth ion substitution without charge compensation. The most common solid state laser is based on neod ymium (Weber 1979). It is usually in a glass or YAG host. Nd, present at around 1 to 5 wt % in the host, is exposed to intense broad spectrum light, and the Nd atoms absorb the light and are pumped to an excited energy state. Then follows the lasing transition to a lower energy level and the production of light emission at or very close to 160 nm. The exact wavelength depends on the host. Neodymium doped YAG emits at 1064 nm, whic h is in the infrared region. This laser is quite popular in cutting, weld ing, and metal heat treating applications. The Ho–YAG and Er–YAG lasers emitting at 2000 nm and at 2 900 nm respectively have been developed for use in microsurgery, in place of CO2 lasers. Ho3+ ion lases at ≈2.08 microns, an eye-safe wavelength. Er–YAG lasers lasing at ≈2.9 microns have also been found useful in dental work (McCallum 1998). This wavelength is shar ply absorbed by water. It is thus possible to effect energy delivery without th ermal buildup in tissue. Single crystal gadolinium–aluminum–scandium garnet (GAS G) doped with nickel and chromium is likely to be used in tunable and high power laser applications. Neodymium doped Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG) crystals are used in high power pulsed lasers. A frequency doubled 532 nm neodymium doped YAG (Nd : YAG) laser with a green beam was approved for medical use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Rare earths such as Pr, Nd, Ho, Er, and Tm used in a variety of hosts such as CaWO4, YAG, and LiFY4 are materials for optically pumped or activated solid state lasers with a wide variety of wavelengths. Multilayer capacitors essential to electronic equipment requ ire dielectrics with a high electric constant and a capacitance invariable over a wide temp erature range, –50 to +120°C. The so-called “NPO” dielectric material used in such capacitors contain neodymium barium titanate formulations. The components present probably include Bao:Nd2O3:nTiO2 (n ≈ 3 to 5) (Molycorp 1993). Rare earths have also been used in the miniaturization of capacitors (La2O3, Gd2O3, Dy2O3) and in the production of thermi stors (Haskin and Paster 1979). Gadolinium oxide has been used in making optical fibers. Significant quantities, several hundred tons, of cerium are used annually, in the form of cerium ammonium nitrate solution for etchin g on substrates in the electronic manufactur- ing industry (Kudo 1988). 1.7.8 Chemical The largest single application of rare earth s, in which the naturally occurring rare earth mixture is useful, is in the manufacture of ra re earth containing zeolite cracking catalysts required in the petroleum refining proce ss (Wallace 1981, Venuto and Habib 1979). In petroleum refining, catalysts are used to incr ease the yield of gasoline obtained from the heavier oil fractions by cracking. In the early 1960s, it was discovered that incorporation of small amounts of zeolite in a silica–alumina matrix resulted in considerable enhancement in the performance of the catalyst in gas–oil cracking. From then on zeolite cracking catalysts have largely replaced th e amorphous silica–alumina catalysts used previously. Zeolites are made catalytically mo re active and thermally more stable at the operating temperatures by replacing the sodium in them with rare earth ions. Rare earth exchanged zeolites are prepared by many method s and the rare earth content of the catalyst may vary from 0.5 to 5%. The rare earth st arting material used commercially for the manufacture of these catalysts is usually a mixt ure of rare earth chlorides or nitrates. Rare earth usage in commercial petroleu m cracking catalysts started in 1964.01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 43 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 44 Porous zeolite catalysts, having as much as 5% rare earth lining in their cavities, were particularly used in the produc tion of leaded gasolines. Oil refineries, however, have been phasing out leaded gasolines since 1985 and phas ing in higher octane varieties. Rare earths tend to lower octane rating and rare ear th use is declining in this industry. The rapid decline in the demand of rare earth s for fluid cracking catalysts was also the result of environmental legislation reducing the amount of lead allowed in gasoline (Hedrick 1997). The refinery industry began substituting fluid cracking catalysts that used significantly lower amount of rare earths, particularly lanthanum concentrates and rare earth chlorides. In the chemical process industry, rare earth elements have been used or considered for use as catalysts for ammonia synthesis, alkyl ation, isomerization, hydrogenation, dehydro- genation, dehydration, polymerization, refini ng of hydrocarbons, and oxidation (Molycorp 1964–1970, Molycorp 1971–1976, Rosynek 1977, Peters and Kim 1981). Methanation catalysts contain rare earths, the ability of ra re earths to form hydrides being useful here (Coon et al. 1978). Rare earth ch elates with diketones were co nsidered for use as antiknock compounds (McGill 1993), as replacemen ts for the well-known lead compounds. The multivalency of europium and cerium have led to the exploration of some interesting possibilities of energy convers ion in aqueous systems (McGill 1997). Catalytic converters have been used in au tomobiles since the 1970s to convert hydro- carbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides in the engine exhaust to water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. The catalysts comprise γ-alumina and small amounts of precious metals, and are activated by cerium, which is about 5% by weight. Cerium provides oxida- tion resistance at high exhaust temperatures , stabilizes rhodium and palladium dispersions, minimizes the interaction of rhodium with al umina, and enhances the oxidizing ability of the system. Efforts have also been made to s ubstitute lanthanum-enriched palladium for the more expensive rhodium. Actually the role of ceria in automotive ex haust catalysts is complex. In addition to enhancing the catalytic activity of precious meta ls deposited on it, its function is described as “an oxygen storage component” that enha nces performance when the exhaust gases are fuel rich/air poor. Anyway, ceria is a crucial ingredient in the catalysts used to control vehicle exhaust emissions and an average catal ytic convertor contains approximately 50 to 75 gms of CeO2 (Molycorp 1993). 1.7.9 Optical The optics industry encompasses a vast range from glasses through lasers and fiber optics to phosphors and fluorescent lights. Through the use of rare earths in these products, communication and vision have improved. The 4 f electrons in the rare earth elements possess narrow and sharp absorption–emission li nes in the visible range, and this plays a role in the use of rare earths in the optics and phosphor industries. An early and continuing use of the rare earths is in the manufacture of glass. As in 1896, Dressback patented and manufactured a mixt ure containing cerium and other rare earth oxides for decolorizing glass (Riker 1981). Th is, incidentally, was the first commercial use of cerium. Iron oxide is always present as an impurity in glass and causes a yellow green color. If decolorizing is necessary due to iron contained in the glass, cerium is added to oxidize the iron. While a chemical decolorizatio n of iron is achieved by oxidation to the trivalent state, physical decolorization is achieved by selective absorption by didymium01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 44 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 45 through optical compensation. A combination of chemical and optic al decolorization may be used. While small amounts of CeO2 decolorize glass, ~1% CeO2 makes glass yellow and larger amounts of CeO2 make glass brown. Neodymium colors glass bright red, praseodymium colors glass green, and their mi xture colors glass blue. Holmium also colors glass blue. Erbium oxide gives a pale pink color to the glass, and this color cannot be obtained by any other means (Riker 1981). Becau se of the stability of trivalent erbium, glass formulations with Er are colored pink. It is the only pink truly stable in glass melts. Pink coloration by erbium is used in ophthalmic mate rials like sunglasses as well as in decorative crystal glassware. Decoration in glass due to im purities such as ferric ions can be neutralized or complemented by erbium absorption, resu lting in the formation of a neutral gray, colorless shade. Incidentally, this is the do minant use for erbium, and erbium oxide of ≈96% purity can be used for this purpose (Molycorp 1993). Further coloring effects are obtainable by combining rare earths with other elements , for example, titanium + cerium for yellow, selenium + neodymium for violet, and nickel + neodymium for red. Cerium is used only in conjunction with other coloring oxides. In 1912, Crookes of England found cerium to be excellent for ultraviolet (UV) absorption without imparting color to the glass, a feature useful in protective eyeglasses. Crookes absorptive sunglasses contain the na tural ratio of Nd/Pr together with a high amount of Ce to give a good UV cutoff. Glasses with 2 to 4% Ce2O3 (or Pr, Nd oxides) absorb UV and infrared (IR) radiation and are us ed in the production of glassblowing and welding goggles. Didymium oxide has long b een used in welder’s goggles because of a high concentration of Nd and Pr, which effectively absorb yellow sodium light. A neodymium-doped glass light bulb has been introduced by GE for use in typical incandescent applications around home. The powder blue colored bulb uses neodymium to absorb the yellow spectrum, which is more prevalent in the emission from a tungsten filament than from natural sunlight, and prov ides a more sunlight-like light with richer colors and improved surface definition of the home environment (Hedrick 2001). Neodymium oxide together with vanadium tr ioxide is used for making optical glass for photometers and nicol prisms. Most cathode ray tube face plates use Ce-stabilized glass. Cerium prevents browning/fogging of glass under nuclear radiation ( γ rays and cathode rays). Large quantities of radiation-sh ielding windows, which provide very high transmission without darkening due to forma tion of color centers, were needed in the nuclear industry. As the result of much deve lopment work in the 1950s and 1960s, cerium is used in radiation-shieldin g windows. Cerium in containe r glass prevents colorization caused by UV radiation and protects the product. Lanthanum was first used in the optical gl ass industry in 1935 by Morey (1938). Low silica glass containing lanthanum oxide poss esses a high index of refraction and low dispersion and is extensively used in the manufacture of camera and other lenses (Greinacher 1981). Optical glass for camera lenses is made from a “lanthanum–flint” composition containing Ca2O3 and B2O3 (Molycorp 1993). Lanthanum oxide does not impart color to the glass. Optical glasses co ntaining up to 40% lanthanum oxide are made and these are also corrosion resistant. Gadolini um is also added to optical glasses meant for use in magnetooptical and electrooptical system s. It is very important that the rare earth materials introduced into the optical glasses be 99.9–99.995% rare earth oxide in purity (Riker 1981) and that no radiation-absorbing oxides are present. In Japan, the world’s largest manufacturer of optical glasses, consumption of La2O3 has been considerable because of large volume production of autofocus SLR cameras and video cameras.01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 45 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 46 Praseodymium is used for vacuum deposited antireflection coating on lenses and as a constituent in tinted glass filters for selective light absorption. The rare earth elements act as activators in laser glasses. Neodymium is the most popular rare earth for this purpose (Grein acher 1981) and this use has already been described. Neodymium can be incorporated in very large glass rods and intense pulses (up to 1015 watts) can be generated from neodymium lasers (Singh 1988). A rare earth laser crystal neodymium (Nd3+) doped lithium niobate (LiNbO3) emits a continuous three-color beam: red, green and blue. The red and green emissions are obtained by frequency doubling and the blue emission is created by self-sum frequency doubling (Hedrick 2001). Glasses doped with rare earths such as Nd, Yb, Er, and Ho could possibly find future technological applications in the areas of luminescent so lar concentrators and light sources for fiber optics in addition to use as laser material s. Luminescent solar concentrators have been prepared using a combination of Nd3+ and Yb3+ with UO2+ 2or Cr3+. Fluoride glasses for fiber wave guide sources contain Er3+. Glass fibers containing ra re earths can transmit data over exceptionally long distances without booste r stations. The glass for these fibers, which may be composed of fluorides of lanthanum , zirconium, barium, aluminum, sodium, and hafnium, is formed by chemical vapor depositi on, rather than through a melt to minimize impurities (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). Er bium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA) are used for optical communications in terrestrial long trunk and undersea cable applications (Auzel and Goldner 1999). This is the current major high technology application of erbium. Optical telecommuni- cations rely on signals transmitted down sili ca fibers. The signals use a wavelength of 1.55 microns which is a low-loss wavelength window in the fiber. Incidentally, erbium lases effi- ciently at this wavelength in the fiber and can be pumped by light of other wavelengths such as visible or near infrared, thus enabling a ve ry efficient optical method of amplification. Erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) contains lengths of fiber, doped with ppm levels of erbium spliced into the optical fibe r at regular intervals. Along with the signal energy the pumping energy is also transmitte d down the fiber. The Er in the EDFA lases, amplifying the longer wavelength light signal that also propagate down the complete fiber. The first application of cerium oxide or ceriu m rich rare earth oxide mixture in glass polishing began in the European glass industry by about 1933, spread to the Canadian optical industry by about 1940, and to the United States in the fo llowing years (Horrigan 1981, Duncan 1970). Special REO compositions containing 50 to 90% cerium oxide, the remainder being other light rare earth elemen ts, are used to polish glass surfaces without abrading. Polishing agents such as rouge, sili ca, and zirconia are slow and dirty and leave minute scratches. REO compounds are much fast er and cleaner and provide a superior finish. Polishing with REO is mostly a chemical react ion and water plays an active role. According to the chemical–mechanical hypothesis (Horri gan 1981), in the ceric oxide polishing of glass, the formation of CeO–Si activated complex permits the rupture of O–Si–O bonds by hydrolysis. Subsequently, the complex CeO–S i breaks apart, the hydrated silica is swept away along with the alkalis released from the glass surface and the process repeats. The quantity of cerium-based products used in the U.S. for polishing mirrors, plate glass, television tubes, ophthalmic lenses, an d precision optics was approximately 340 metric tons in 1960. The advent of the Pilkington process in 1972–73 for large scale plate glass manufacture curtailed this market for cerium oxide; however, over 1000 metric tons of cerium-based products continued to be used for polishing in the U.S. by the 1980s.01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 46 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 47 1.7.10 Phosphors The first application of a rare earth elemen t in a sophisticated technology was in 1965, thanks to the work of Levine and Palilla (1965), when a materi al consisting of Eu doped in an yttrium-containing host Eu3+.YVO4 was introduced as red phosphor in color television picture tubes, replacing the previously used Ag activated CdS red phosphor. The strong and sharp emission lines of europium at 610 nm without a yellow compon ent, perceived by the eye as a wonderfully saturated red color tone , provided an evenly colored TV picture. Subsequently, YVO4 was replaced by either Y2O3 or Y2O2S. Both these phosphors are better than the vanadate because their energy conversion efficiency is greater and their emission is a bit more orange. Color for televi sion and computer screens is obtained through the use of three phosphors: a europium–yttrium compound for red, a terbium fluoride–zinc sulfide for green, and a cerium–strontium sulf ide for blue. When activated by photons, these phosphors emit the luminescence that makes the screen attractively colorful. Each color TV screen requires approximately 5–10 g yttrium oxide and 0.5–1 g europium oxide (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). Since 1964, the TV industry has been using highly purified Y and Eu oxides in ton quantities. The purities required exceed 99.9% and many individual impurities in excess of 100 ppm ma y be deleterious. The TV face plate contains neodymium oxide which blocks ambien t light from ruining the picture. A new rare earth phosphor, lithium doped Gd2O3:Eu3+, has been developed in Korea for flat panel field emission displays. This phosphor is said to have higher cathode luminescence than the widely used commerci al phosphors, europium doped yttrium oxide and europium doped yttrium ox y-sulphide (Hedrick 2000). Another phosphor with potential use for fi eld emission arrays to produce compact lightweight displays that consume less el ectricity than CRTs is the green rare earth phosphor SrGa2S4:Eu2+. This could potentially substitute for the use of the standard green CRT phosphor ZnS:Cu, Al (Hedrick 1998). Several CRT phosphors contain Tb. For example, Tb:YAG and Tb:Y2SiD5, a phosphor for high intensity green emission needed for projection TVs (Welker 1991, Ronda et al. 1997). Rare earth based phosphors are composed of rare earth activators and host lattice. The optical spectral inertness of hosts such as la nthanum, gadolinium, yttrium, and lutetium, ensure that they do not interfere with the act ivator emission spectra. There is an added advantage of close chemical similarity, whic h makes substitutional incorporation of rare earth activators in these hosts possible. Be sides, rare earth hosts such as oxides, oxysulfides, phosphates, vanada tes, and silicates are rugged materials compatible with high temperature operations involved in tube pro cessing and in their reclamation (McColl and Palilla 1981). Some more examples of cathode ray tube phosphors are Ce2O2S:Tb3+, CaS:Ce3+, and SrGa2S4:Eu2+ for green, and SrCl5(PO4):Eu2+ and ZnS:Tm3+ for blue (McGill 1993). An organolanthanide phosphor (OLP) for po tential commercial use in flat panel displays has been developed by researchers at the University of Oxford, U.K. The polymer material is an organoterbium emitter. A high efficiency organic electroluminescent device that produced a green light with peak lumine scence of 2000 candelas per square meter has also been fabricated (Hedrick 2001). Ce (III) has no absorption bands in the visible but does absorb strongly just outside the visible spectrum, in the UV re gion. Solids with Ce(III) often sh ow strong optical absorption and luminescence in the UV or near UV. Cerium is used in several CRT phosphors. In fluor- escent lighting, phosphorous Ce is also used as a sensitizer for other lanthanide emitters. 01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 47 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 48 A number of rare earth phosphors have been developed for conversion of x-radiation into visible light, which then strikes photog raphic film (Rabatin 1981). Phosphors that consist of Tb3+ – Gd2O2S or Yb3+ – La2O2S, Eu – BaFCl, Tm – LaOBr, and La2O3–Tb have allowed significant reduction in the x-ra y dosage required for medical radiographic data. For example, Tb activated gadolinium oxysulfide, curre ntly the most popular x-ray phosphor, enables up to 80% lower x-ray do sage to patients. In addition to reduced exposure to patients as well as to staff, the advantages of rare earth phosphors over the originally used calcium tungstate phosphor incl ude need for less silver in the film and a sharper picture because of reduced patient movement within a shorter time interval (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). Eu-based p hospho-luminable phosphor s are in use for the automation of x-ray detection systems. The ph osphor used is Eu doped BaFBr or variations of this material. The phosphor used absorb s the x-ray radiation. In a separate later processing step, upon stimulation by a small spot laser beam, the phosphor emits visible radiations proportional to the absorbed do se (Crawford and Brixner 1991). Gadolinium compounds act as hosts in scintilla tor materials such as Eu: (Y, Gd)2O3, Pr, Ce:Gd2O2S for computed tomography (Greskov ich and Duklos 1997). The RE2O2S materials account for a significant fraction of the world’s use of ra re earth elements. Important among these are Y2O2S for TV phosphors and other oxysulphides for x-ray screens. The luminescence of Tm under x-ray excitation is in the near UV (= 375 nm) and blue (= 465 nm). This closely matches the sensitivity normal photographic film. Tm:LaOBr is a sensitive x-ray phosphor helpful in reduction of x-ray exposu re of patients (Molycorp 1993). In another application to films, CaF2:Eu is placed in front of a solar cell to convert UV sunlight into the visible region where the solar cell can efficien tly convert it into electricity (McCallum 1998). Scintillation is a flash of light produced in a phosphor by absorption of an ionizing particle or photon, and a scintillation c ounter is a device for detecting and counting scintillations produced by ionizing radiati on. Scintillation detectors are used to detect x-rays and gamma rays. A lanthanum chloride compound doped with 10% trivalent cerium emits at 330 nm and 350 nm. This compound ma y be used as a scintillation detector. The cerium-doped lanthanum chloride compound has better energy resolution and improvedresponse times than the thalium-doped sodium iodide, the most commonly used scintillation detector material (Hedrick 2000). Rare earths are also useful as lamp phos phors. The three spectral lines most important to human vision are blue-violet near 450 nm, green near 535 nm, and orange-red near 615 nm. Lamp phosphors activated by Eu 2+ supply the blue-violet color. Commercial phosphors based on the broad emission of Eu2+ at just the right spectral position for the blue are Eu:Sr5(PO4)3cl, Eu:Ba Mg2Al16O27 and Eu:Sr4Al4O25. Trivalent terbium, holmium, and erbium are candidates for pure green emi ssion but had problems compared to the old trustworthy zinc silicate:Mn2+. Thus, the addition of ra re earths to the phosphors in fluorescent lamps makes the light appear more natural. Some of the phosphors employing terbium’s green emission are Tb : (La,Ca)PO4, Tb : CaMgAl11O19, Tb : (Ca,Cd)MgB5O10. Europium and terbium are used as activators with yttrium, lanthanum, or gadolinium as hosts. The resultant light is stronger and lead s to approximately 25% savings in capital and operating costs (Jackson and Christiansen 19 93). Energy-efficient illumination, ranking high in visual efficiency, is given by ra re earth phosphors based on scandium also. Scandium, in small amounts, has been wide ly used by the lighting industry in the manufacture of metal halide lamps. Because of the hygroscopicity of the scandium iodide, it is incorporated by a specia l process that forms the iodide in situ in the lamp by reacting01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 48 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 49 a small piece of scandium with elemental iodine. Scandium metal is used by lamp manufacturers in the form of uniform small di scs (Davies 1981). Dysprosium is also used in metal halogen lamps to impr ove brightness (Kudo 1988). The atomic emission spectra of dysporium at high temperature contains many lines in the visible spectrum. Dysporium is ad ded as anhydrous halides, e.g., DyZ3. The salts dissociate in the lamps hot center, absorb energy there and emit radiation efficiently producing high intensity illumination. The ions later recombine at the lamp’s cooler wall surfaces (Molycorp 1993). The role of rare earths in lamp phospho rs was summarized by Thornton (1981) with this statement: the emission from rare earth phosphor is not only useful but made to order for the requirements of the human visual system for optimal seeing. Rare earth silicates are useful as specialized phosphor hosts. Yttrium orthosilicates are commercial phosphors and also have potential for projection TVs. The high efficiency and very fast decay time of Ce:Y2Si2O7 material makes it suitable for specialized CRT use. Ce: Gd2SiO5 is a potential scintillator for positron emission imaging and gamma ray detection (Molycorp 1993). A new class of luminescen t materials represented by the blue-white phosphor Sr2CeO4, which has an unusual type of one-dimensional chain structure, is said to have a possible future use in flat pane l displays, fluorescent lig hting, television and computer CRT monitors, and temperature sensing (Hedrick 1998). The samarium compound SrB4O7 : Sm2+ is usable above 100 gigapascals and to a temperature of 800 K. This is the material in a new optical pressure gauge developed for diamond anvil cells. Pressure measurement is ba sed on shift in the fluorescence line of the material. Traditionally, shift in the fluorescence line of ruby was used for pressure measurement, and samarium compound emits in the same range as the ruby line, but with higher intensity (Hedrick 1998). 1.7.11 Nuclear Rare earths have found a variety of applicati ons in nuclear energy. One of the largest uses of Gd oxide is in the nuclear power industry. It is used in General Electric Company’s boil- ing water reactors (BWRs) as a burnable portio n. Gadolinium oxide is mixed directly with uranium oxide, and its presence in the fuel help s in achieving a uniform neutron flux during the lifetime of the fuel element. Gadolinium not only has a high ne utron absorption cross section but also a burn-up rate similar to that of 235U. Besides Gd2O3 has physical and chem- ical properties very similar to UO2. Gadolinium is used intima tely mixed at ~5% with UO2 in a pellet form. About 2 metric tons of Gd oxide were estimated to be in use in 26 opera- tional BWRs in the U.S. A ga dolinia burnable poison system for pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs) was under development at Babcock and Wilcox. Besides gadolinium, the elements Eu, Sm, and Dy have a large cap ture cross section for thermal neutrons, and dysprosium has also been considered as a bu rnable poison. Europium is unique because, like hafnium, it exhibits a high capture cross section. Not only is th e cross section of the naturally occurring mixture of isotopes of euro pium high, but also each of the five isotopes of the uninterrupted series 151Eu, 152Eu, 153Eu, 154Eu, 155Eu, each one forming on capture of a neutron by the one with one mass number less, has large capture cross sections. This property is valuable for the use of europium for control rods in compact nuclear reactors (Greinacher 1981), as, for example, in nu clear submarines. Europium hexaboride, EuB6, has been considered as the neutron absorber ma terial in fast breeder reactors. This boride01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 49 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 50 has both europium and boron as neutron abso rbers, and the novel neutron absorbing prop- erties of europium are combined with the he xaboride stability (Molycorp 1993, Pasto and Tennery 1977). The neutron absorbing isotope 167Er has properties that can provide an extremely long life time for nuclear fuels for specialized re actors. It has been used in a U–Zr–H fuel in research submersibles. Erbia, Er2O3, is also homogeneously mixed with UO2 fuel, to enable pressurized water reactors to operate with a 2-year load recycle (Jonsson et al. 1992). Yttrium has a low capture cross section for thermal neutrons and was considered as a material for tubing in molten salt nuclear r eactors. Because of high hydrogen atom density and high temperature stability, Ce and Y h ydrides are useful as neutron moderators (Greinacher 1981). The ( n, β) reaction characteristic of Gd an d Dy and their availability as thin foils have also greatly benefitted the nondestructive techniqu e of neutron radiography (Davies 1981). Neutron radiography is a useful practical tool for nondestructive testing in the aerospace, nuclear, and engineer ing industries, and its widesp read use very much depends on the availability of gadolinium and dysprosi um in the form of thin foils. In neutron radiography, like in x-ray radiography, an imaging beam is passed through the specimen and the attenuated beam is recorded to prod uce an image of the internal details of the specimen. The recording medium in neutron radi ography is also a sta ndard x-ray film. This film, however, is insensitive to neutrons and so needs an aid to produce the image. The aid is a 0.025 mm thick gadolinium foil placed in direct contact with the x-ray film. When exposed to the attenuated thermal neutron beam, the gadolinium absorbs neutrons and promptly emits beta radiation (electrons), and th e x-ray file is sensitive to the beta radiation. Dysprosium is used for the same purpos e but differently. In neutron radiography, dysprosium foil generally 0.1 mm thick is e xposed to the attenuated neutron beam but in the absence of the x-ray film. The exposed dy sprosium foil is then removed from the beam and its beta decay (nuclear transformation by emission of beta rays) is used to produce an autoradiograph in contact with the x-ray film . This technique, using dysprosium, has been particularly suitable for radiography of highly radioactive materials (Davies 1981). Dysporium doped crystals, particularly CaSO4 or CaF2, have been used in dosimeters for monitoring exposure to ioni zing radiation, such as gamma rays or neutrons (Molycorp 1993). Such a crystal on expos ure to energetic radiation creat es in situ and qualitatively excited Dy atoms. When the crystal is h eated these atoms luminesce producing a glow peak. The magnitude of the glow peak is re lated to the radiation dose. Thalium doped in CaSO4 is used in dosimeters for radiation meas urements. This is used for precise measure- ments of low radiation doses in the range 0. 1 mR to R, for example in personal badge detectors (Molycorp 1993). The exceptional thermal stabilization of monazite and xenotime structures, possible single phase behavior up to th eir melting points, combined wi th limited chemical reactivity has led to the suggestion that rare earth phos phates be considered as hosts for the long storage of radioactive waste (Molycorp 1993). 1.7.12 Hydrogen Storage An application for the rare earths that was identified in 1969–1970 concerns the hydrogen energy system. The ability of the intermetallics REM5, where RE is the rare earth and M is iron, cobalt, or nickel, to absorb a large amount of hydrogen at room temperature was01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 50 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 51 identified in 1969 by Zijlstra and Westendorp (1969) of the Philips Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, The Netherlands. The following year, Van Vucht, Kuijpers and Brunning (1970), also from the same laboratory, reveal ed the remarkable hydrogen absorption prop- erties of LaNi5. This intermetallic absorbs hydrogen readily at room temperature to form the compound LaNi5H6, which has per cubic centimeter more hydrogen than even liquid hydrogen. It also gives off hydrogen at a hi gher temperature and the whole absorption and desorption process is essentially reversible wi th only a small hysteresis loop. Lanthanum nickel intermetallic can be used commercially as a hydrogen storage medium and for related technological applications. Solid state storage of hydrogen offers advantages in volume,weight, pressure, energy savings, and sa fety over cryogenic and compressed gas. While LaNi 5 is most efficient in terms of both capacity and kinetics, it also remains more expensive than the majority of its rivals. Lanthanum in LaNis can be partially replaced by cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, misch metal or thorium, and nickel by Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, or Pt. It is thus possible to vary the hydrogen absorption–desorption prop- erties for various commercial applications or for basic research studies (McGill 1997, Gschneidner and Daane 1988, Buschow 1984). The world’s largest hydrogen storage vess el was made by Kawasaki Heavy Metal Industry (Omachi 1988). The vessel has a capacity of 175 Nm3 and carried a total 1000 kg charge of La-rich misch metal–nickel alloy fo r hydrogen storage, and is operated at 700 kPa (at 30°C) stage pressure. Compared to hi gh pressure hydrogen storage of the same capacity, the vessel is 30% lighter and occupies only ~14% of the volume. Besides, in one cycle of absorption–desorption, hydrogen ga s is upgraded in purity from 99.99% to 99.99999%. The Japanese also have been developing hydrogen fueled cars and even have successfully road tested a Toyota wagon (2000 cc, 4 cycles) driving a 200-km stretch at 100 km/h. In this, a La–MM–Ni–Al alloy was sel ected for hydrogen storage (Omachi 1988). The hydriding reaction between hydrogen an d lanthanum nickel alloy is specific and is usable as a method for separation of hydr ogen and also for purification of hydrogen as mentioned in the previous paragraph. The meta l hydride process for separation or recovery of hydrogen from industrial off-gas streams co nsists of two steps: hydrogen absorption and hydrogen desorption. The off-gas feed stream is passed through a packed bed containing the hydriding alloy while maintaining the hydrog en partial pressure in the stream at more than the equilibrium decomposition pressure (o f the hydriding alloy) to enable absorption of hydrogen by the bed. In the second st ep, the absorbed hydrogen is recovered by desorbing the hydrogen from the bed either by increasing the bed temperature or by lowering the system pressure. This scheme has advantages such as reaction specificity (only hydrogen reacts), high hydrogen rec overy, product purity (>99.9%) and energy efficiency (Huston and Sheridan 1981). The metal hydride process has been investigated for hydrogen recovery from ammonia purge gas stream generated during ammoniamanufacture. When the objective is hydrogen pu rification, after absorbing residual gaseous impurities are expelled by simply desorbing a portion of the hydride. The possibility of reversible hydrogen absorption–desorption over a range of temperatures has been used in hydride chemic al compressors. Hydrogen is absorbed at low temperatures and pressures and desorbed at a higher temperature and pressure. AtBrookhaven National Laboratory, U.S., a LaNi 4.5Al0.5 alloy was used and hydrogen pressures up to 7600 kPa were attained in capsules. The unit also delivered 1.2 m3 of hydrogen at 4250 kPa in a continuous operation (Huston and Sheridan 1981). Hydride heat pumps have been devised on the basis of the reversibility of metal–hydrogen reaction and the heat of the ch emical reaction. In these devices, which are01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 51 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 52 closed units comprising two or more hydride beds, hydrogen functions as the energy carrier. With no moving parts in the system, heat can be pumped over large temperature differentials by a suitable choice of hydriding alloys, heat sources, and heat sinks. These hydride pumps can operate with low grade heat. A demons tration unit made by Ergenics used LaNi5 and LaNi4.7Al0.3. This unit generated hot water at 95–100°C from wastewater at 60°C and 20°C cooling water. In Japan, hydrogen heat pu mps have been used to function as an air- conditioning system (Omachi 19 88). The pump used 800 kg of MM–Ni–Ca–Al alloy and had a capacity of 630 MJ/h. This air cond itioner, installed at an 18-room leisure house in a spa in Hokkaido, operated efficiently with en ergy input from the spa’ s hot water for cooling in summer and warming in winter. A larg e chemical heat pump using 3500 kg of MM–Ni–Co–Al alloy, having a capacity of 1300 MJ/h, was also developed in Japan (Omachi 1988). A hydride refrigerator that co uld cool to as low as – 240°C (33 K) without using electricity has also been described (J ackson and Christiansen 1993). In a chamber, lanthanum nickel hydride was heated to 104°C. Stored hydrogen gas was released and this gas was passed through a heat exchanger and was then allowed to expand. The expansion cooled the gas considerably and some liqui d hydrogen was also formed. The gas was conducted to another chamber where it was ab sorbed by more alloy to form the hydride. The cycle was then repeated using the new hyd ride until the cooling chamber attained the target temperature. Two types of hydrogen-based rechargeable batteries containing rare earth elements have been proposed (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). Both offer good cycling life, high energy and power density, effective protectio n from over- and under-charging, and superior low temperature behavior. In the first type, electrodes composed of lanthanum, neodymium, nickel, cobalt, and silica are used. In the second type, which was made by the Sharp Corporation of Japan, in the form of 20 mm diameter buttons giving 1.2 V, the battery is composed of a nickel–oxide an ode, a lanthanum–nickel–tin cathode, and a separator of polyamide resin containing caustic potash. When an electrical load is applied, the cathode releases contained hydrogen that co nsists of protons and electrons, the protons pass through the separator to the anode, and the electron generates electric current. For alkaline nickel–metal hydride batteries, two families of metal hydrides are widely used. They are the AB5 and AB2 intermetallic compounds where, in general, A is a late transition or a rare earth element, and B is one or more early transition elements (Züttel et al. 1999). A popular AB5 alloy is Lm(Ni3.6Mn0.4Al0.3Co0.7), where Lm stands for lanthanum-rich misch metal ( ≈50 wt % La). The AB5 type alloys, which form hydrides up to AB5H6, are currently replacing the cadmium electrodes in nickel cadmium batteries because they are environment friendly and have high energy density. The NiMH (nickel metal hydride) batteries are the leading rechargeable batt ery product, ahead of nickel–cadmium and lithium ion types. NiMH batteries are used in cellular phones, portable computers, personal data assistants (PDAs), camcorders and othe r portable devices (Hedrick 2001). These batteries are also recommended as midterm tech nology for electrical vehicles by the United States Automotives Battery Consortium (Vog t 1998). NiMH batteries are used in both hybrid electrical vehicles (HEV) and pure el ectric vehicles (PEV). By 2000, HEVs were commercially available in the U.S. The comme rcially available HEV Honda Insight with a NiMH battery outputs 144 volts and in the To yota Prius, the battery produces 274 volts. The driving ranges of the PEVs range from 55 km to 240 km (Hedrick, 2000). In the 1990s demand has increased for rare earth metals used in nickel hydride rechargeable batteries. 01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 52 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 53 1.7.13 Superconductor A topic that has generated considerable worldw ide interest in relatively recent times is high critical temperature ( Tc) superconductivity. Until recently all the known high Tc materials contained either yttrium or one of the lanthanides (Kilbourn 1988). A ceramic compound of Y, Ba, Cu, and O exhibits zero resistance at 90–100 K, making it possible to replace expensive liquid helium with the cheaper liquid nitrogen as a refrigerant for the superconductor. These new superconductors have already been fabricated in thin films, the form used in electronic circuits, on a labora tory scale in the U.S. Large scale commercial use of these superconductors will depend on whether these materials can sustain the high currents necessary in applications such as electricity pylons, power generators, electric storage units, and electric motors . Another potential application area is in devices where power losses are usually significant but current s are small. The major developments in the field have been extensively reviewed (Wu et al. 1987, Hatfield and Miller 1988). As far as the rare earths are concerned, the practical realization of commercial high Tc superconductors would mean an unpreceden ted demand for several of the rare earths. 1.7.14 Miscellaneous Rare earth metals have been useful as gett er materials for removing residual oxygen in a small confined volume. The great affinity of the rare earths for oxygen is the basis of this application. A remarkable application of cerium, develo ped in the 1980s, is in starch poly- acrylonitrile copolymers, that absorb 500 to 1000 times their weight of water. These copolymers have been developed in Japan for making baby diapers (Kudo 1988). For this application, cerium is used in the form of oxide or hydroxide, in quantities of several hundred metric tons per annum. Cerium is us ed as a high pressure antiwear lubricant. Cerium fluoride is added to greases, pastes and suspensions used as lubricants (Molycorp 1993). An interesting application of rare earths, wi dely practiced in the People’s Republic of China, is to use the rare earth elements as tr ace nutrients in agricultur e. The positive effects of rare earths on plant growth have also been claimed by Buckingham et al. (1999) in Australia while Diatloff et al. (1999) from the same country have not found a positive effect on plant growth. Rare earths have also been used in radiopharmaceutical therapy (Turner 1998). For this application, β emitting radiolanthanides such as holmium-166 (half-life 26.8 h), samarium-153 (half-life 46.3 h), and lutetium-1 77 (half-life 6.7 days) have been suggested as suitable. These radionuclides also emit γ photons of suitable energies for quantitative imaging on conventional γ cameras. Their half-lives corresp ond to the required irradiation time for the tumor cells and thus minimize radiot oxicity to normal tissues. All these qualify them as tools for radiopharmaceutical treatmen t of cancer patients for whom conventional therapy has failed. Rare earths are used in the paints and pigm ents industry (Desai 1988). Cerium com- pounds with or without the hy drous oxides of aluminum or silicon are used extensively to coat lead chrome paints to improve their light fastness. Titanium dioxide pigment is treated with cerous acetate to improve resistance to sun light and outdoor durability particularly for the pigments applications in synthetic fibe rs, molding compositions of high polymers,01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 53 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 54 paints, powder coatings, and wire coatings . A water-based yttrium coating to provide corrosion resistance and a lead-free primer for paints has been developed (Hedrick 2001). Yttrium hydroxide coating is applied by electrodeposition from an yttrium salt and converted to yttrium oxide during heat curing. Rare earth compounds also find use in the paint industry as dryers, in the textiles industry, as oxidizing agents for self-cleanin g ovens and also in wastewater purification (McGill 1997). Lanthanide caroxylates are used as paint dryers. Cerium carboxylates addition in alloyed resin promote drying of the resin coating by accelerating the cross-linking reactions within the polymer sk in. Cerium salts are used as combustion additions. These salts, soluble in hydrocarbo n, promote the complete oxidation of diesel fuels (Molycorp 1993). Cerium stearate controls the labile hydrogen in PVC, limits the high temperature dehydrochlorinatio n reactions and hence confers high temperature stability to PVC. Cerium and titanium dioxide have been us ed to make an improved electrorheological (ER) fluid. The viscosity, stiffness and heat transference of the fluid can be varied using an electric field. Under the field, the particles in the ER fluid are polarized and organize into structures, thus increasing the viscosit y. Cerium-doped titanium dioxide in dimethylsilicone oil had five to six times hi gher shear stress than pure titanium dioxide. Potential applications of the rare earth materi al are in viscous clutches, variable cushion shock absorbers and other variable coupling de vices (Hedrick 2001). A process that allows cerium dioxide to be used as a sunscreen has been developed. Cerium dioxide particles arecoated with a 10-nm layer of boron nitrid e which eliminated agglomeration, provided cerium catalytic activity and produced a slippery feel when incorporated into an organic thin film. The coated cerium particles had higher transparency and greater UV blocking than the common sunscreen ingredients such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide. The improved sunscreen reduces sunburn, reduces skin aging and reduces potential causes of skin cancer (Hedrick 2000). The total rare earth consumption can be distributed among many major end-use categories. The approximate distribution in th e year 2001, in the U.S. (Hedrick 2002) by end use was as follows: Glass polishing and catalysts = 34% Petroleum refining catalysts = 16%Automotive catalytic convertors = 15%Metallurgical additives and alloys = 14%Rare earth for lighting, television/compute r monitors, radars and x-ray intensifying film = 9%Permanent magnets = 8% Other uses = 4%. Although the rare earths occur abundantly in nature, they were never cheap materials. This has resulted in current rare earth user s searching for a cheaper solution even for established applications of rare earths. The su bstitution of rare earths has been occurring in two ways. One is through the use of new proces ses and the other is through the use of new substances (Greinacher 1981, Falconnet 1988). Th ese are listed in Table 1.5. It is, however, apparent that while substitution of rare ear ths occurred where metallurgical and magnetic01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 54 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMTHE RARE EARTHS 55 properties are involved, in those applications based on optical, chemical and certain special magnetic properties substitution appears less likely. Thus applicatio ns of rare earths in certain polishing applications, catalysts, ph osphors, magnets, optical glass components, coloring and decoloring of glass, pigments, and intensifiers of x-rays will be long lasting. Focusing on the scenario for the future demand of rare earths, the use of rare earths in applications such as automotive pollution cat alysts, permanent magnets and rechargeable batteries will continue to increase with a gr owing demand for automobiles, electronic equip- ment, computers and portable equipment. Futu re growth is forecast for rare earths in applications such as rechargeable NiMH batt eries, fiber optics and medical applications including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) co ntrast agents, positron emission tomog- raphy (PET), scintillation detector s, medical isotopes, and dental and surgical lasers. Future growth is also expected for rare earths in magnetic refrigeration alloys (Hedrick 2001). 1.8 SUMMARY What are rare earths? How were they all discovered and why did their discovery occur over an unusually long period of scientific end eavor? What are their properties? What types of interactions do they undergo? Apart from scie ntific curiosity, what had made researchers attempt to unravel the mystery surrounding th e enigma called rare earths? These questions are briefly answered in this chapter. Notwiths tanding the great scientific merit of studying the rare earths for their own unique characteristic s, it is very clear that the rare earths are remarkably useful materials in an extensive ra nge of technological fields. In many of these they are simply unsubstitutable. The rare earth s are extremely useful materials and they are abundantly available in nature. The logical e ffort then will be to produce them cheaply in sufficient quantities and of required quality. This is not possible without a good under- standing of the physics and chemistry of the ra re earths. To study the physics and chemistry of the rare earths, in turn, the rare earth s were needed in pure form. This “catch-22” situation, which persisted in the rare earth indu stry during the first four decades of the 20th century, was alleviated by the remarkable an d highly rated research work conducted atTable 1.5 Alternatives to rare earths in applications.

Spedding, starting from the late 1940s. Largely through these efforts, th e technology became availa ble that brought the rare earths within the reach of any scient ist who wished to study them. Many research groups all over the world have investigated th e rare earths and highlighted their scientific behavior and application possibilities. This first chapter provides the backdrop needed to appreciate the remainder of the book. Specifically, this chap ter provides the background necessary to understand the separation processes to isolate the rare earths from one another. Physical properties given are invariably related to their application poten tial in reduction and refining steps. Many of the applications listed also justify the n ecessity to take pains and obtain the required quantity of rare earth material. 01 Chapter 1 1-56.fm Page 56 Monday, November 8, 2004 12:40 PMCHAPTER 2 Resources of Rare Earths 2.1 INTRODUCTION The rare earths are moderately abundant elements in the earth’s crust that occur in a large number of minerals. Rare earths typically occur as carbonates, oxides, phosphates and silicides in the forming minerals. Rare earth minerals are found in hard rock and placer deposits located throughout th e world, with unusually large deposits occurring in a few countries. Rare earth minerals in most of th e deposits, however, are such that they can be recovered only as co-products or by-products of certain other minerals. In some important deposits, however, the rare earths can be reco vered as the primary or main product. Even though there are a large number of rare earth minerals, much of the actual world rare earth supply comes from only a handful of sources. Ab out a dozen more rare earth minerals also occur in deposits that can be used to supplement easily the rare earth supply. The total rare earths contained in world rare earth reserves is considered sufficient to meet the foreseeable demand for these elements, thro ugh the twenty-first century. While the total rare earth content in world ra re earth resources is large, the availability of individual rare earth elements has for long remained highly unequal. This situation is the culmination of many factors, both inherent and transient. The inherent factor is that while each of the rare earth minerals generally contai ns all the rare earth elements, the concentra- tions of individual rare earths in the mineral ar e, as a rule, highly unequal. In each mineral some rare earth elements are present in high concentrations while some others are in very low concentrations, and this, in turn, varies fr om mineral to mineral. Besides, there is a wide variation in the contents of different mine rals in the rare earth deposits. The predomin- ant mineral in world rare earth deposits is en riched with respect to rare earths of lower atomic numbers and highly depleted with resp ect to rare earths of higher atomic numbers. The next most important mineral is also simi larly disposed, but to a lesser extent. As a result, the rare earths of lower atomic numbers are available more than the rare earths of higher atomic numbers. The transient factor rela tes to the by-product status of the rare earth minerals and the occurrence of the element th orium in some of them. These factors affect the current production of the minerals and he nce the availability of individual rare earth elements present in them. This chapter details the natural occurrence of the rare earth elements in several different minerals, the occurrence of the mine rals in various deposits, and the location of the deposits in different countries of the wo rld. The composition of the mineral and the oooo for the typesetter: page 95 is a disconnected page02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 58 distribution of individual rare earths in the mi neral and the quantity of rare earths contained in the deposit are presented. The status of the rare earth deposits as a present or potential resource for rare earths is highlighted. An overal l picture of the availability of rare earths, vis-à-vis their consumption, is given. The un equal availability of individual rare earth elements is mentioned, and estimates on th e amounts of individual rare earth elements theoretically recoverable from world rare earth resources are provided. 2.2 CRUSTAL ABUNDANCE The abundance or scarcity of an element is conveyed in a general way by its crustal abundance, which is its average concentration in the earth’s crust. Many estimates of the crustal abundance of the rare earths have b een made and values that differ considerably from one another have been reported. This is illustrated in Table 2.1. The values given by Lide (1997) represent the median of the vari ous reported values. These values have been adopted for the present discussion. In terms of inherent abundance in the earth crust, the rare earths are not rare because the total rare earths abundance (220 ppm) is more than that of even carbon (200 ppm), and several rare earth elements are more abundant than many better known metals. This is presented in Tabl e 2.1 and illustrated in Figure 2.1. Among the rare earths, the relative abundance varies widely. Those elements having even atomic numbers are more abundant than their odd numbered neighbors (K ilbourn 1988). The rare earths with lower atomic numbers (lighter rare ea rths), as will be described later, have larger ionic radii hence are more incompatible and th erefore more strongly concentrated in the continental crust than the rare earths with la rger atomic number (heavier rare earths). Thus lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodym ium are the most abundant rare earths.

In comparison it can be stated that cerium is more plentiful th an copper; neodymium, yttrium, and lanthanum are more plentiful than cobalt or lead; pr aseodymium, samarium, gadolinium, dysprosium, and erbium are each more plentiful than tin; and ytterbium and thulium, the least abundant of the rare earths, are each more pl entiful than mercury or silver. The extent to which a metal is used in t echnology and is available commercially is determined not only by its crustal abundance but also by many other factors (Hampel 1961). These include (1) the degree of metal concentrat ion by natural processes into ore deposits, (2) the relative ease of obtaining the ore fro m the environment, and (3) the feasibility of extracting the metal from the ore. Unlike th e common metals like copper and lead, which form fairly concentrated natural deposits, the rare earths occur widely distributed in low concentrations. Added to this, the nature of their mineralization and the complexity of the processes needed for their extraction seems to justify the adage “rare” — even though considering crustal abundance alone they are not rare. 2.3 MINERALS In nature the rare earths do not occur in the elemental state, nor do they occur as individual rare earth compounds. The rare earths, scatte red dilutely in the earth’s crust, occur as mixtures in many rock formations such as ba salts, granites, gneisses, shales, and silicate rocks and are present in amounts ranging fro m 10 to 300 ppm (Sabot and Maestro 1995). Their strong affinity for oxygen has result ed in their being fo und mostly as oxidic compounds even though other combinations are possible. The rare earths occur in over 160 discrete minerals. Most of these minerals ar e rare but the rare earths content in them, expressed as oxide, can be as high as 60% ra re earth oxide (REO). Many other minerals, in which the rare earths occur by atomic substitu tion, are also known (Aplan 1988). In total, nearly 200 minerals containing >0.01% rare earths are presently known (O’Driscoll 1991). As a rule, any rare earth mineral usually contai ns all the rare earth elements with some of them enriched and some others in very low concentrations. Figure 2.1 Abundance of rare earths and certain common elements in the earth’s crust. 02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 60 A listing of selected rare earth minerals from the point of rare earth extraction (Aplan 1988, Ferron et al. 1991, Jackson and Christiansen 19 93) is given in Table 2.2. Even though the rare earth minerals are so many in number, about 95% of all the world rare earth resources occur in just three minerals, bast nasite, monazite, and xenotime. These three therefore are the principal ore minerals for rare earth extraction. Among these, again, bast- nasite occurs most frequently, monazite is s econd, and xenotime is the distant third.

The minerals a llanite, apatite, and other phosphorite sources, eudialyte, fergusonite, floreneite, parisite, perovskite, pyro- chlore, zircon, and a few other naturally occurri ng rare earth bearing materials are also con- sidered potential rare earth resources. The first eight rare earths, lanthanum to ga dolinium, are often referred to as the cerium subgroup of the rare earth elements or light rare earth elements, and the remaining eight elements, terbium to lutetium, together with yt trium, are said to belong to the yttrium sub- group or heavy rare earth elements (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). Sometimes, the rare earths are divided into three subgroups. From lanthanum to neodymium are called “light rare earths,” from samarium to dysprosium are known as “medium rare earths,” and from holmium to lutetium, including yttrium, are called “heavy rare earths” (Sabot and Maestro 1995). In another classification (Kremers 196 1), the light rare earths, from lanthanum to samarium, are called the “cerium group;” the mi ddle rare earths, europium to dysprosium, are called the “terbium group;” and the heavies, holmium to lutetium and yttrium, are called the “yttrium group.” 2.3.1 Bastnasite The mineral bastnasite is a fluorocarbonate of the cerium group rare earth metals and hardly contains any thorium. As regards the geologi cal environment, bastnasite is found in vein deposits, contact metamorphic zones, and pegm atites. Bastnasite occurs as veins or dis- semination in a complex of carbonate–silicate rocks, occurring with and related to alkaline intrusives, for example, in California. Bastna site occurs in quartz veins that cut micaceous schists and quartzite, in Burundi. It is in fluorite-bearing veins and breccia filings in Permian sandstone, for example, in New Mexi co (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). The rare earth content of bastnasite is approximatel y 70% REO, mostly of the lighter elements. Bastnasite is a primary source of light REO in the enormous deposit in Bayan Obo in China (800 million metric tons; 6% REO) and at Mountain Pass, California in the U.S. (3.3 million metric tons; 7.7% REO). The rare ear th content in bastnasite from these locations is given in Table 2.3 (Hedrick 1991). In addition, bastnasite is also the main REO mineral at Brockman in Australia, Pocos de Caldas in Brazil, Thor Lake in Canada, and Karonge in Burundi. Bastnasite is chemically susceptibl e to weathering and this causes REO to dis- solve and combine with available phosphates. 2.3.2 MonaziteThe mineral monazite is a phosphate, mainly of the cerium group rare earths and thorium. Monazite is found in many geological enviro nments. It occurs as an accessory mineral in acidic igneous rocks, in metamorphic rocks, a nd in certain vein deposits. Due to its chemi- cal stability it also develops into detrital mi neral in placer deposits and beach sands (Aplan 1988). The primary monazite deposits have b een useful as rare earth resources in a few instances. Notable among them are occurre nces in Van Rhynsdorp and Naboomspruit (South Africa), in Colorado (U.S.) and in Ba yan Obo (China). The most important monazite resources have been the beach placers. Alluvi al, stream, and aeolian deposits have been much less significant. Beach sand deposits contain, in addition to monazite, other heavy minerals like ilmenite, rutile, and zircon. So metimes monazite co-occurs with placer gold oooooo02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 62 or tin deposits (Aplan 1988). Monazite-bearing heavy minera l sand deposits are found in large quantities principally in Australia, Brazi l, China, India, Malaysia, South Africa, and the United States.

This is shown in Table 2.4. Usually monazite contains about 70% REO, and the rare earth fraction is constituted by 20 to 30% Ce2O3; 10 to 40% La2O3; significant amounts of neodymium, praseodymium, and sa marium; and lesser amounts of dysprosium, erbium, and holmium. Yttrium content may vary from a trace to ~5% Y2O3, and thorium content of 4 to 12% is common. Some amount of uranium is also present in monazite. 2.3.3 Xenotime Xenotime is an yttrium phosphate containi ng about 67% REO, mostly of the heavier elements. The mineral is a minor constituent of granite or gneiss (Aplan 1988). Having undergone a weathering, transportation, and concentration process similar to that of monazite, xenotime co-occurs w ith it in placer deposits, but such deposits are relatively few. Usually the content of xenotime may range from 0.5 to about 5% of the monazite present. An occurrence where the proportion of xenotime may be as high as 50% was identified in California (Sabot and Maestro 1995). Xenotime occurs in the placer cassiterite deposits in Malaysia and in certain Australia n heavy mineral sands. Xenotime occurs also in the placer cassiterite deposits of Indonesi a and Thailand and in the heavy mineral sands of China, as well as in the alluvial tin mines of Brazil (Highley et al. 1988). The rare earth distribution in xenotime is given in Table 2.5. In addition to the three major minerals, there are several other rare earth minerals that ar e, or could be, of importance in the economic recovery of rare earths. 2.3.4 Allanite This mineral is a rare earth bearing member of the epidote group. Allan ite occurs in igneous, hydrothermal, and metamorphic environments. It may be found as small or disseminated crystals throughout the pegmatitic body or as veins varying in width from a fraction of an inch to several feet. The rare earth content of allanite is normally limited to about 5% REO, but it may vary from 3 to 51%, depending on the source. The thorium content of allanite may vary from a trace up to 3%. It is the re latively low REO and thorium content and the usually scattered presence in the rock that has kept allanite from being processed on a large scale. However, allanite had been considered as a useful future resource (Nininger 1956) because it is available in very large quantities and might be produced at a lower cost per ton than monazite. At present three deposits are co nsidered to have potential for allanite mining (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). They are th e Mary Kathlean uranium tailings in Queens- land, Australia, the Alice Springs prospect in the Northern Territory, Australia (1 million metric tons, 4% allanite, 20% REO), and th e deposits in Hall Mountain Group in Idaho, United States. The rare earth distributio n in allanite is given in Table 2.5. 2.3.5 Apatite Apatite is a calcium fluorophosphate. It is fo und in carbonatites, alkaline igneous rocks, and some sediments. Apatite is not a rare earth mineral but a rare earth concentrating mineral (Aplan 1988). Rare earth ions proxy calcium ions in the lattice because of the similar size of the rare earth ions and calcium ions. The rare earth content of apatite is 02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 64 highly variable and ranges from a trace to ov er 10% (as REO). The amount and distribution of rare earths are dependent on the nature of the host rock. The rare earth distribution in Kola apatite is given in Table 2.5. Apatite may constitute a substantial resource for rare earths. Unlike most of the rare earth minerals, which are found only in smal l quantities in a potential ore body, apatite occurs in large quantities lik e bastnasite and monazite. Large quantities of rare earth bearing apatit es occur at Kola Peninsula (~1% REO) and in the Vishnevye Mountains (>1% REO) in th e former Soviet Union (Hedrick 1985), in Phalaborwa in South Africa, and in the Minevi lle iron ore in New York State in the United States (Aplan 1988). Rare earth bearing apat ites have also been located in California placers (Hedrick 1986) and in Florida (Altschu ler et al. 1967). Phosphorites in the large phosphoria formation of Montana, Utah, an d Wyoming contain rare earths (0.16%) (Aplan 1988). The quantity of rare earths contained in phosphate sources has been estimated to be over 8 million metric tons REO (Cross and Miller 1988). 2.3.6 Brannerite The uranium ore brannerite contains rare ear ths and occurs in pegmatites and conglomer- ates. The major economic location for bra nnerite is the Precambrian quartz pebble conglomerate at Elliot Lake, Ontario, Canada (Adams and Staatz 1973). The distribution of rare earths in the deposit is given in Table 2.5. Brannerite also o ccurs in association with gold in the Witwatersrand deposit in South Afri ca (Highley et al. 1988) and at Radium Hill, Australia (Adams 1971). 2.3.7 Eudialyte Eudialyte is a zirconium mineral that in some instances contains rare earths (1 to 3% REO) and could be rich in yttrium (0.2 to 1%) (Ferron et al. 1991). This silicate mineral occurs in nepheline syenite, for example, at the Ilimauss aq deposit in Greenland; and in peralkaline granite, for example, at Pajarito in New Me xico, United States (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). The rare earth contents of these de posits are 0.9% and 0.18% REO, respectively. Eudialyte deposits also occur in the form er USSR and Canada. An advantage is that eudialyte tends to form as coarse grained euhedr al crystals that are easily dissolved in acids. 2.3.8 Euxenite, Fergusonite, Flor encite, Gadolinite, and Loparite The minerals euxenite and fergusonite are comp lex tantaloniobates of titanium, rare earths, thorium and uranium. These co-occurring meta l values and the heavy rare earth content make euxenite processing attractive (Dayton 1 958). Euxenite occurs in the placer deposits of Idaho. The mineral florencite is an aluminum phos phate. It occurs in the weathered zone of carbonatites. This mineral by itself can be rela tively high in REO, but it is not known to occur in large quantities (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). Gadolinite is a beryllium iron silicate mine ral found in granites, granitic pegmatites, and placers. Gadolinite is a widespread but not abundant component of pegmatites and has been found in veins, lenses, and pockets in ma ny locations, particularly in the United States oooo02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 65 (Kleber and Love 1963). Recently gadolinite deposits have been f ound in Quebec and Yellowknife, Northwest Territories (Canada) (Hedrick 1985). Gadolinite usually contains about 40% REO. The rare earth distribution (Foos and Wilhelm 1954 , Spedding and Powell 1954) is given in Table 2.5. Loparite is basically a niobium ore that cont ains titanium and the rare earths. A large deposit of loparite occurs in the Kola Penins ula of the former Soviet Union. The rare earth content is as much as 30% REO (Jackson and Christiensen 1993), from the cerium group. The rare earth distribution in loparite is given in Table 2.5. 2.3.9 Perovskite Perovskite, which is a calcium titanate, is a rare earth concentrating mineral where the rare earths substitute calcium. Rare earth containing varieties, enriched essentially in the light rare earths, are mainly associated with al kalic igneous rock suites. A major prospect containing perovskite is at Powderhorn, Colorado, U.S. Here the rock contains 0.36% REO (Jackson and Christiensen 1993). Large quantiti es of rare earths are reportedly contained in various perovskite ore bodi es (Haskin and Paster 1979). 2.3.10 Pyrochlore Pyrochlore is another rare earth concentr ating mineral (Aplan 1988, Highley et al. 1988). In this mineral, rare earths substitute in th e alkali position.

An unusual type of rare earth ore known as ion adsorption type ore is found at various locations in South China. This ore was formed by the weathering rare earth-rich primary granite-type rock or volcanic rock followed by adsorption of soluble rare earth species on clays. Mild, humid, rainy climatic conditio ns and tectonically stable environment are suitable for these processes to occur. In sout hern China, especially in the Jiangxi Province, where such conditions prevail, many ion ad sorption-type rare earth deposits are found. Incidentally, the weathering process also modifi es the proportion of the various lanthanides originally found in the source rock, as they ultimately end up as the ion adsorption ores. The composition of ion adsorption ores depend on location, but overall they are relatively rich in Y and the mid-rare earths such as Eu , Sm and Gd. The rare earth distribution on the ion adsorption ore are given in Table 2.5. 2.3.13 Scandium Minerals The abundance of scandium in earth’s crust is greater than even such well-known metals as lead, tin, mercury, and silver. Yet, scandium ra rely occurs in concentrated quantities. The reason is that scandium does not combine with ore-forming anions. The rare earth element scandium does not us ually occur in the rare earth minerals. An important exception is the huge iron–niobi um–rare earth deposit in Bayan Obo, China. This deposit contains scandium in concen trations ranging from 0.006 to 0.016% Sc 2O3 in various ores and dispersed over the niob ium and rare earth minerals (CREI 1998). The major source of scandium is uranium ores, which contain about 0.1% scandium. Some scandium is also recovered from wolfra mite. Scandium content in wolframite is of the order of 500–800 ppm and this was considered an important potential resource in the U.S. (Kleber and Love 1963). The only mineral that contains a large percentage (33 to 45) of scandium is thortveitite. It is a scandium silicate in which variable amounts of yttrium and lanthanides, aluminum, iron, thorium, zi rconium, and alkaline earths substitute for scandium. This mineral is very rare. Only two sources are known. It was found in the granitepegmatites in northern Norway, and a variety called befanamite was found in Madagascar. Thortveitite is not consider ed an important source of s candium. Slags from blast furnaces used in the production of cast iron and ti n smelting are also sources of scandium.02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 67 2.3.14 Promethium Several rare earths are among the elements form ed in the fission of uranium and plutonium. The spent fuel from nuclear reactors is the only source of the rare earth element promethium (Wheelwright 1973). 2.4 RARE EARTH DEPOSITS 2.4.1 Primary and Secondary The minerals of rare earths occur in a variety of geologic environments. Generally they are found in hard rock deposits or in placer sand s. The hard rock deposits are of primary origin and the placer deposits are of secondary origin . The composition of the rare earth minerals in these deposits is strongly influenced by the presence of phosphates and carbonates (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). 2.4.2 Carbonatites The most dominant sources of rare earths are carbonatites (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). These are deep-seated magmas, rich in carbon di oxide and low in silica, that intruded the earth’s crust and solidified. Ma gmas forming closer to the surface usually lose their carbon dioxide and other volatile agents and do not bear rare earths. The rare earths in carbonatites are almost exclusively the light rare earth elements contained in minerals such as bastnasite, allanite, and apatite. Monazite, wh en present, contains the maximum amount of rare earths and a minimum amou nt of calcium and thorium. 2.4.3 PegmatitesPegmatites are a hard rock source of rare earths that begin as granitic magmas formed by remelting of crustal material (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). As the magma cools, crystals incorporating heavy rare earth elemen ts form first. This is followed by crystal- lization of the residual liquid, which is relati vely rich in lighter rare earth elements. Thus monazite and allanite in pegmatites tend to be richer in the heavy rare earths than when they are found in other rocks. The overall rare ear th content of monazite is, however, decreased because it is likely to have more calcium and thorium. 2.4.4 Hydrothermal Deposits Rare earth elements can be carried by hydrot hermal solutions that are developed through the interaction of hot underground water with crustal material (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). The light rare earth elements are less soluble than the heavier elements, and they therefore tend to settle out first, leaving the liquid more concentrated in heavy elements. As ooo02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 68 a result, hydrothermal deposits contain minera ls such as xenotime, which are enriched in the heavy rare earths. 2.4.5 Weathered Deposits Deep chemical weathering of carbonatites cau ses the dissolution of calcite, dolomite, and apatite. The rare earths released as a result of this activity have an a ffinity for the phosphate radical and form superzene monazite. Pyrochlore is converted to florencite and perovskite is converted to anatase by extreme lateritic w eathering. Generally, the light rare earth min- erals are converted to heavy rare earth minerals (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). A peculiar type of rare earth deposit may be formed as a result of in situ lateritic weathering of igneous rocks. In situ weathering of REO rich host rocks occurring under conditions of prolonged weatheri ng with limited erosion can result in ion adsorption typeTable 2.6 Distribution of rare earth oxide deposits, mineral types, and production status of mines in those deposits by country (from Jackson and Christiansen 1993) 1Includes allanite, anatase, apatite, brannerite, davi dite, eudialyte, florencite, gadolinite, perovskite and xenotime. 2Mines or deposits known or assumed to have no production. 3Number of mines or deposits of the known pr oducers that generate REO concentrates for each country.Country Deposit type Mineral Production status No. of depositsPlacer Hard rockMonazite Bastnasite Other1Non- producer2Producer REO concentrates3 Argentina 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 Australia 35 28 7 30 2 3 21 14 11 Brazil 16 14 2 0 2 0 12 40 2 Burundi 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0Canada 5 0 5 0 1 4 2 3 1 China 4 3 1 3 1 0 0 4 4 Egypt 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0G a b o n1 0 1 0 0 1 1 00 Greenland 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 India 5 5 0 5 0 0 1 4 4 Kenya 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 Malawi 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0Mauritania 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 Mozambique 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 Namibia 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0New Zealand 2 2 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 South Africa 3 1 2 2 0 1 0 3 1 Sri Lanka 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1United States 40 13 27 32 3 5 32 8 2 Uruguay 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 Total 123 71 52 96 11 16 82 41 2602 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 69 deposits wherein a high Si, Al clay crust ad sorbs rare earth ions from weathered minerals of a host rock (Clark and Zheng 1991). 2.4.6 Placers Large amounts of rare earth minerals such as monazite and xenotime are contained in placers. These minerals are characterized by high specific gravity and chemical inertness. They are therefore stable during the erosion and transportation cycles of weathering. The major locations for placers are rivers, deltas, and coastlines. Heavy minerals are concen- trated along the coast by a combination of ti dal action, long shore currents, waves, winds, and natural traps such as a cape. Important placers for mining are recently formed beaches and dunes along the coastlines, as well as so me older deposits that have become stranded due to land elevation or ocean withdrawal. 2.4.7 Distribution According to a United States Geological Surv ey Circular (Jackson and Christiansen 1993), there are 123 important rare earth deposits in the world and they are located in 20 countries. The distribution is indicated in Table 2.6. Most of the deposits are located in the United States, followed by Australia, Brazil, Canada , India, and China. These deposits have been categorized either as placers or as hard rock type. Numerically, placers are more in number. Th ere are 71 placer deposits in the world and 52 hard rock deposits. Mostly the placers are found in recent or ancient shorelines and less frequently along present or former river banks. Monazite is the predominant rare earth mineral in the placers. The countries having ma jor placer deposits are Australia, Brazil, the United States, India, China, and New Zealand. Placer deposits are also found in Argentina, Egypt, Mozambique, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Uruguay. The data given in the U.S. Geological Survey Circular (Jackson and Christ iansen 1993) do not include rare earths in the tin placers of Southeast Asia and de posits in the former Soviet Union. As regards the hard rock deposits, th e maximum number are found in the United States, followed by Australia, Canada, Brazil, Burundi, South Africa, and China. Monazite is the major mineral found in most of the hard ro ck deposits, in 96 out of the total 123; bast- nasite is predominant at 11 sites. At the 16 remaining deposits, the leading minerals are allanite (3 sites), brannerite (3), apatite (2 ), and eudialyte (2), with anatase, davidite, florenite, gadolinite, perovskite, and xenotim e limited to individual properties. The ion adsorption type ore deposits of China do not fi gure in the U.S. Geological Survey Circular (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). 2.5 RESOURCES AND RESERVES The term resources has been generally used to denote the deposits of a commodity, in this context, the rare earths in or on the earth’s cr ust in such forms and co ncentrations that eco- nomic extraction of the commodity is presently feasible. The term reserve , on the other hand, has been used to represent, in the pres ent context, the specific bodies of rare earth02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 70 bearing material of known location, quality and quantity, from which the rare earth can be extracted presently. Resources of rare earths, therefore, include reserves (Bureau of Mines Staff 1975). The total quantity of rare earths contained in world rare earth reserves had been esti- mated, for a long time, at 47.6 million metric tons of REO (Hedrick 1988, Clark and Zheng 1991, Sabot and Maestro 1995). Most of the rare earth reserves were located in China followed by the U.S. with important quantities also occurring in Australia, India, the former Soviet Union and South Africa. These data have been drastically revised with the discovery of a huge rare earth reserve in Namibia and major upward revision in the estimates of rare earth reserves in China, the United States , Australia, and India (Jackson and Christiansen Table 2.7 Rare earth oxide resources in the world’s major rare earth oxide deposits, by geologic type and resource category (from Jackson and Christiansen 1993) Deposit typeMineral R1E Other resources Number of depositsMillion metric tons% Number of depositsMillion metric tons% REO ore resources Placer Monazite 59 17,421 85 14 7,278 61 Hard rock Monazite 21 991 5 14 1270 11Hard rock Bastnasite 10 1302 6 5 2815 23 Hard rock Other 16 866 4 6 662 6 Total 106 20580 100 39 12025 100 REO Placer Monazite 57 6.732 7 10 3230 13Hard rock Monazite 21 11.605 12 13 1,987 8 Hard rock Bastnasite 11 72.118 77 5 18936 76 Hard rock Other 14 2.959 3 6 0.894 4 Total 103 93.414 100 34 25,047 100 Figure 2.2 United Nations resource categories. 02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 71 1993). Excluding the reserves in the former So viet Union, the world rare earth reserves are presently estimated at 93.4 million metric tons REO. In 2001, U.S. Geological Survey esti- mated world resources of rare earths to be 100 million metric tons (Mt) of contained REO (Hedrick, 2001). However, new terms have b een defined to describe the world rare earth resources. A more detailed description of world rare earth resources has been made using the international classification system for mi neral resources recommended by the United Nations Group of Experts on Definitions an d Terminology for Mineral Resources (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). The United Nations resource classification is summarized in Figure 2.2. The whole of the in situ resources are divided into known deposits, extensions of known deposits, and newly discovered de posits and undiscovered deposits. The known deposits that are of greatest current interest are again divided into economically exploitable deposits (R1E), marginally economic (R1M), and subeconomic (R1S). The R1E deposits generally refer to the deposits known usually as reserves. The details of rare earth ore resources in major world rare earth deposits as given by U.S. Geological Survey Circular (Jackson an d Christiansen 1993) are summarized in Table 2.7. Worldwide rare earth resources of th e R1E category (ore grade material in R1E resources) amount to a total of 20.6 billion me tric tons, with the placer deposits constituting 85% of the total, and hard rock deposits co nstituting the remaining 15%. Dividing the total R1E resource tonnage in terms of minerals, 90 % of it is monazite, 6% bastnasite, and 4% other rare earth minerals. The quantities of rare earth oxides (REO) in R1E resources of the world are listed in Table 2.8. The total REO contained in R1E cat egory world rare earth resources amounts to 93.4 million metric tons. Only 7% of th is total REO tonnage are contained in placer deposits and 93% are in hard rock. Dividing in terms of minerals, 20% of the total REO tonnage is contained in monazite (present in both placer and hard rock), 77% in bastnasite, and 3% in other rare earth minerals. The data in Table 2.8a present the familiar picture of China ranking first in the listing of world rare earth reserves. China, with 48 mi llion metric tons of REO in bastnasite, is the country having the largest amount of REO. Na mibia, which has 20 million metric tons of REO, also in bastnasite, is th e second. The United States has 14 million metric tons of REO, 73% of it in monazite, and ranks third. Australi a is fourth with 5.7 million metric tons of REO, 69% of it in monazite. India has 2.6 million metric tons of REO, all of it in monazite, and ranks fifth. South Africa and Canada, each having one million metric tons of REO, come next. These are the seven countries having major rare earth reserves. The current status on world rare earth re serves and reserve base can be obtained through publications of the U.S. Geological Survey. The late st figures on world rare earth resources appearing in Mineral Commodity Summaries issued in January 2003 (USGS 2003) are reproduced in Table 2.8b. These data are based on revised reserve and known base estimates for China. The table also includes information on rare earth resources of the former Soviet Union. Estimates of reserves of almost all the countries are revised to relatively lower values. 2.6 OCCURRENCES Rare earth deposits are found at various lo cations in the world.

Details and additional information on these and other deposits are given below for various countries. 2.6.1 Argentina A rare earth–uranium–thorium deposit is locat ed in San Luis Province, Argentina. The project known as “Rodeo de los Molles” is lo cated about 300 km southwest of Cordoba and 200 km northeast of San Luis. Minerals of economic significance include bastnasite, britholite (a rare earth silicon phosphate), and allanite with 2.0 to 2.5% rare earth content (RIC 1995). 2.6.2 Australia Australia has major rare earth reserves. There are 30 monazite and 2 bastnasite deposits in Australia, and other rare earth minerals occur in 3 more deposits. Ou t of the total 35 REO deposits, 27 are placers (Jackson and Chri stiansen 1993). Heavy mineral sand placer deposits comprising ilmenite, rutile, zircon, monazite and, in a few cases, xenotime occur extensively along the Australian coast, partic ularly the east and west coasts. There are 15 placer deposits in western Australia, 7 in Queensland and 5 in New South Wales. The west coast deposits are mainly paleobeach placers an d the principal deposits are located inland and 10 to 100 meters above sea level. The depo sits on the east coast have been formed by waves and wind and their combination. Eight rare earth deposits in Australia are located inland. Three of them are in west Australia , two in south Australia, and one each in the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Victoria. Eneabba The Eneabba mineral sands deposit on the west coast north of Perth has been the major source of monazite in Australia. Ad ditional mineral sands reserves occur in the adjacent Eneabba West deposit. The minera l sands of Eneabba also contain useful quantities of xenotime (Taylor 1991).Table 2.8b World rare earth reserves and reserve base Country Reserves (Mt REO) Reserve base (Mt REO) United States 13.0 14.0 Australia 5.2 5.8 Brazil 0.11 0.31 Canada 0.94 1.0 China 27.0 89.0India 1.1 1.3 Malaysia 0.03 0.035 South Africa 0.39 0.4Sri Lanka 0.012 0.013 Former Soviet Union 19.0 21.0 Other countries 21.0 21.0World total (rounded) 88.0 150.002 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 74 .

Cooljarl oo’s deposits were estimated as 16 million metric tons of proven and 42 million metric tons of probable ore grading 3 to 5% heavy minerals, including monazite (Hedrick 1985a). Reserves at Jurien Bay were estimated at 25 million metric tons of proven and 1 million metric tons of probable ore grading 6 to 7% heavy minerals, including monazite. At Coolja rloo, the mined sand is composed of about 0.2% monazite, and at Jurien Bay the sand contains 0.7% monazite. Total reserves were equivalent to 64,000 metric tons REO at Cool jarloo, and 100,000 metric tons REO at Jurien Bay (Hedrick 1985a).

The WIM-150 deposit contains an estimated 32 million metric tons of heavy minerals in an area of about 40 square km. This in cludes 580,000 metric tons of monazite and 170,000 metric tons of xenotime. Murray Basin About six times the amount of rare earths in the WIM-150 deposit occur in the four other deposits of Murray Basin, western Victoria (RIC 1993). The monazite and xenotime content of the Murray Basin heavy mineral deposit, on the whole, has beenestimated to be about seven times larger than the current proven reserves of rare earths in Australia. The deposit is a comm ercial source of zircon and titanium minerals in addition to monazite. Olympic Dam The Olympic Dam deposit is a huge multimetal (copper, uranium, gold, and rare earths) resource (Taylor 1991). The ha rd rock ore body contains rare earth mine- rals at a typical concentration of 5000 ppm. The minerals found are bastnasite, monazite, and florencite with a very minor amount of xenotime. Significantly, the most abundant of the rare earth minerals in the deposit, bastnasi te, is abnormally enriched in heavy rare earths and the usual europium depletion is absent. Brockman The Brockman deposit is located in the East Kimberley region of western Australia. It is potentially a major source of yttrium and heavy rare earths that could be recovered along with other minerals (Taylor 1991). Up to 100 meters in depth, 8.97 million metric tons of resource grading, in percentage, 1.027 ZrO2, 0.116 Y2O3, 0.437 Nb2O5, 0.026 Ta2O5, 0.038 HfO2, 0.01 Ga, 12.1 Al2O3, and 0.105 REO have been indicated. Besides, up to a depth of 250 meters, 13.6 million metric tons of additional resources of similar grades have been inferred. Toongi A deposit is located at Toongi, which is 20 km south of the large regional town Dubbo in central New South Wales approximat ely 410 km northwest of Sydney. To date only limited work has been done on the eval uation of this deposit, which has indicated 10 million tonnes of resources from 0 to 30 meters depth (Taylor 1991). The composition is 2.1% ZrO2, 0.05% HfO2, 0.14% Y2O3, 0.56% Nb2O5, 0.036% Ta2O5, and 0.75% REO. An additional 40 million tonnes of deposits of similar grade occur between 30 and 100 meters of depth. The yttrium content of the deposit is nota bly high and the distribution of rare earth oxides indicates that several rare earth minerals contribute to the tota l rare earth content of the ore. Mount Weld The Mount Weld rare earth deposit in western Australia ranks as one of the richest major rare earth resources in the world (Taylor 1991). The Mount Weld complex comprises world class rare earth oxide and niob ium/tantalum deposits developed within the Mount Weld carbonatite, an intrusive pipe appr oximately three kilometers in diameter. The main deposits are hosted within the soil/regolith horizon that blankets the entire carbonatite and form shallow lenses and sheets within 60 m of the surface. The most important REO deposit, the Central Lanthanide Deposit, CLD, is located at the center of the carbonatite with the Nb/Ta and other deposits generally located towards the outer fringes. Discovered in 1988, the CLD represents a spectacular enrichment zone of REDS. The deposit is believed to be the largest and highest grade of its type in the world. The resource here is estimated at 1.69 million metric tons grad ing 26.1% REO, using a cut-off grade of 20% REO, and 6.2 million metric tons grading 17 .22% REO, using a cut-off grade of 10% REO. It has also been stated that the rare earth contained in th e Mount Weld deposit is sufficient to supply 15 to 20% of the present world de mand for rare earths for over 20 years. The02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 82 principal rare earth mineral in the deposit is supergene monazite, and in some zones the mineralization is predominantly churchite — hydrated yttrium phosphate mineral. The europium content of monazite is unusua lly high. Most importa ntly, the Mount Weld deposit is low in the radioactive element thorium. Besides, the ore zones have low deleterious element levels in other elements su ch as fluorine and calcium, which is relevant in both metallurgical and operating environmental performance. John Galt This is a hard rock deposit containi ng high grade veins of xenotime and is located in the Kimberley region of western Aust ralia. The rare earth distribution in the ore is generally similar to xenotime, but the yttriu m content as a proportion of total rare earths is higher than normal (Taylor 1991). Yangibana This is a hard rock rare earth deposi t in western Australia. In this deposit, the rare earth mineralization occurs over a di stance of approximately 7 km with a width of several hundred meters. The estimated size of the resource is 3.5 million metric tons with an average grade of 1.7% REO (Taylor 1991). The ore probably has unusually high europium content. 2.6.3 Bangladesh Heavy minerals including monazite occur in the Cox’s Bazaar coastal area of Bangladesh. The beach sand deposits, located 100 km s outheast of Chittagong along the coast and nearby islands, contain resources estimated at 5 million metric tons of heavy minerals (Hedrick 1985a). 2.6.4 Brazil There are numerous beach sand deposits extending from the nort hern border of the state of Rio de Janeiro over the state of Espirito Santo to the state of Bahia, on the Atlantic coast. Monazite deposits also occur in the state of Parana. According to the United States Geo- logical Survey Circular (Jackson and Christia nsen 1993), there are 14 monazite deposits, one bastnasite deposit, and one deposit of ot her rare earth minerals in Brazil. The crude mineral sand of Brazil contains around 10% of heavy minerals of which between 10 and 15% is monazite. The monazite contains about 64% of the rare earth oxides, 5.5 to 6% of thorium oxide, and 0.15 to 0.2% of uranium ox ide. The relative concentration of rare earths in monazite is given in Table 2.4. The rare earth deposits at Sao Goncalo de Sapucai and Tapira are of considerable interest (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). The Sao Goncalo de Sapucai deposit is the first inland placer to be dredged in Brazil. It is located on the Sapucai River in Minas Gerais. At Tapira, which is an existing phosphate mi ne based on apatite, an anatase bearing overburden currently stockpiled contains reco verable titanium and rare earths. A hard rock deposit at Pocos de Celdas in Minas Gerais is a resource containing 1.5 million metric tons of bastnasite. The average rare earth content of bastnasite in the deposit is 3.3% REO. According to the latest estimates (Hedrick 20 00) 42000 tons of mon azite occur in marine alluvial deposits and 40000 tons occur in str eam placers. The resources of marine origin are distributed in deposits primarily in the states of Rio de Janeiro (26730 tons), Bahia (10186 tons) and Espirito Santo (4136 tons). The str eam placers occur in the states of Mines Gerais (24396 tons), Espirito Santo (113 72 tons) and Bahia (3481 tons).02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 83 2.6.5 Canada In terms of rare earth resources, Canada is one of the seven major countries in the world. Canada is unique in that its rich rare earth reserves are not consti tuted by placer monazite or a large hard rock deposit with bastnasite as the principal mineral. The “other minerals” make up for the large rare earth deposits in Canada. According to the United States Geological Survey Circular (Jackson and Christiansen 1993), there are 5 rare earth deposits in Cana da, all of which are hard rock deposits. Three of these deposits contain uraninite, branne rite, and monazite, while the remaining two deposits contain gadolinite, zircon, monazi te, allanite, fluorite, and pyrochlore or columbite and xenotime. Rare earths occur with uranium in the uranium deposit at Elliot Lake, Ontario (Drew et al. 1991). An yttrium–bery llium–zirconium deposit at Strange Lake, northeast of Schefferville on the Queb ec–Labrador border contains huge quantities of rare earths in addition to beryllium, pyrochlore, and fluorite (Argall 1980). The current estimate of the reserve is 25 million metric tons with 0.38% yttrium. Large deposits of rare earth bearing pyrochlore occur at St. Honoré and at Oka in Quebec (N oblitt 1965). The rare earth content of Oka pyrochlore averages almost 10% REO and ranges from 2.5 to 11.8% REO. Cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, and yttr ium predominate in this pyrochlore, which also has 0.02 to 1.51% ThO2 and 0.03 to 0.72% U3O8. A specialty metals deposit at Thor Lake, 130 km southeast of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories contains the rare earth s yttrium and beryllium. Proven reserves of 431,000 metric tons of ore grading 0.2% Y2O3 have been reported (Hedrick 1985a). A major new source of rare earths has been discovered in southern Yukon, Canada. Over1,500,000 metric tons of ore are contained in a wide fluorite-bearing vein, which has a mineral assemblage of monazite and xeno time. The following composition has been reported for a representative rock outcrop of the deposit: 0.15% yttrium oxide, 0.62% niobium oxide, 1.10% zircon, 0.02% hafniu m oxide, and 1.37% lanthanides consisting mostly cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium oxides. 2.6.6 China China is foremost among the seven major coun tries with 48 million metric tons of REO found in resources located in the country. It has also been stated (Jackson and Christiansen 1993) that China probably has more rare earth deposits than what has been reported. Some of these deposits are among the world’s largest rare earth resources. There are four main belts of rare earth mi neralization in China (C lark and Zheng 1991). They are (1) Inner Mongolia be lt, (2) Fuji, Jiangxi –Guangdon g, Guangxi – Hunan belt, (3) Hubei-Sichuan belt, and (4) Southeast China b each placer belt. Each of these belts has a unique type of rare earth mineral occurrence. The Inner Mongolia be lt contains the Bayan Obo rare earth–iron mine, which, with over 350 million metric tons of reserves, is the world’s largest rare earth mine. The principal mi nerals are bastnasite and monazite in a dolo- mitic iron formation. The Fuji, Jiangxi–Guan gdong, Guangxi–Hunan belt occurs along the borders of the provinces mentioned and contai ns the relatively recently discovered and currently exploited ion adsorp tion deposits. The deposits are lateritic zones containing bastnasite, synchysite, and allanite. The or e occurs in numerous small deposits. The Hubei–Sichuan belt occurs along the border s of these two provinces and consists of bastnasite and parisite occurring in barite and calcite veins associated with alkaline and02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 84 carbonatite rocks. In the southeast China beach placer belt, beach placer deposits containing monazite and xenotime occur along the coas tal areas of west Guangdong Province and Haian Island. Thus rare earth deposits occur throughout the eastern half of China. Among these the metasedimentary deposits, which include th e Bayan Obo deposit and the ion adsorption type deposits of southeast Ch ina, are the most important. Bayan Obo The Bayan Obo iron–rare earth–niobium ore bodies, discovered in the late 1920s, are located 135 km northwest of Baotou in the Nei Monggol autonomous region of northern China. The Bayan Obo iron–rare earth–niobium mine is China’s largest iron mine with iron ore reserves of more than 1 billion metric tons. The rare earth reserves of Bayan Obo exceed 35 million metric tons REO. The genesis of the Bayan Obo deposit has been explained in many ways (Kanazawa and Miyawaki 1991), as a marine sedimentar y–diagenitic deposit, as a sedimentary– meta- morphic–hydrothermal deposit, and as a marine facies volcanosedimentary deposit and as marine facies volcanosedimentary carbona tite. It has also been interpreted (Drew et al. 1991) that the Bayan Obo iron–rare earth–ni obium ore bodies were formed by hydro- thermal replacement of Middle Proterozoic dol omite in an intercontinental rift setting. Clark and Zheng (1991) have described the Bayan Obo deposit as occurring in a severely folded and faulted sequence of middl e Proterozoic slates, quartzites, dolomites, and limestones intruded by Hercynian granit es and weakly metamorphosed. The main mineralization zones lie south of the Kuang Gow fault and occur primarily in what is known as the H8 dolomite. The H8 dolomite occurs within a zone that extends 18 km in the east-west direction and is 2 km in width. The majority of the co mmercial deposits occur here. The H8 dolomite occurs throughout the zone and is more than 1000 meters thick. Within the H8 dolomite there are three main ore zones: the main ore body, the east ore body, and the west ore body. The main ore body and the east ore body have reserves of 20 million metric tons and 15 million metric tons of REO, respectively. Ther e are 16 medium ore bodies in the west mine. The main ore body consists of tubular an d/or lenticular bodies of REO bearing magnetite and hematite iron ores. A high but vari able amount of fluori te is associated with both the ore and the surrounding dolomitic host rock throug hout the Bayan Obo deposits. At Bayan Obo, the REO bearing iron ore as well as the host H8 dolomitic rocks are the sources of rare earths. The main ore bo dy has an average REO content of 6.19%, the east ore body 5.17%, and the west ore body approximately 1% (Argall 1980). Dolomitic type ores in the main and east ore bodies also contain a considerable amount of rare earths (2 to 4% REO). The primary rare earth bearing minerals in the Bayan Obo ore bodies are bastnasite and monazite. These two together constitute approximately 80% of the REO occurring in the deposit. A total of 29 individual rare earth minerals have been reported to be intergrown in the Bayan Obo deposit. Among these, 13 are stated to be new minerals (Clark and Zheng 1991). The rare earths in the ore at Bayan Obo occu r as individual minerals and less than 10% is dispersed isomorphically in other minerals. In the ore bodies (Clark and Zheng 1991), bastnasite and monazite are closely associat ed and their ratio (bastnasite to monazite) varies depending on the ore type . Usually the quantity of bastna site is 20 to 100% more than the quantity of monazite in the ore. Monazite in the ores of Bayan Obo cont ains an average of only 0.26% of ThO2. The REO and P2O5 together account for 98% of the mo nazite composition. The low thoria02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 85 content and high REO content make this a highly desirable mineral for rare earth production. The thoria content of bastnasite va ries in the range 0.02 to 0.28%, making this also a favorable mineral for rare earth productio n. Fluorine occurrence is widespread in the mine but more than 98% of the fluorine in th e deposits occurs primarily as fluorite and as a minor component in bastnasite. Ion Adsorption Ore An unusual type of rare earth de posit known as the ion-adsorption type occurs in southern China (Clark and Zheng 1991). Th e deposits were initially discovered in southern Jiangxi Province, which to date remains the principal region for ion adsorption type deposits. Addi tional ion adsorption deposits have been discovered in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Hu nan, Guangxi, and Southern Anhui. The ion adsorption deposits form as the result of in situ weathering of REO rich host rocks, most commonly granitic or volcanic ro cks. For their formation, therefore, there must be sufficient quantity of rare earth-bearin g host rock occurring within the zone of weathering, and the weathering or lateritic pr ocess must be balanced so that prolonged weathering is possible but with limited eros ion. The rare earth cations from the host rocks are mobilized onto the aqueous phase and mi grate downwards. Simultaneously with the weathering, various aluminosilicate minerals, su ch as kaolimite clays, form and these in turn adsorb the RE3+ cations. Such weathering requires a mild, rainy, humid and tectonically stable environment over a long period of time. All th ese conditions are met in southern China, and hence a large number of i on adsorption type REO deposits occur there. Even though the reserve estimate of rare earths in ion adsorption type deposits in China is placed at one million metr ic tons REO, Clark and Zheng (1991) state that it is likely to be several million metric tons RE O. Over 100 individual mineralized occurrences have been identified in Jiangxi Province alon e, and geologic studies have shown granitic outcrops, which are potential sources of ion adsorption deposits, occupy very extensive areas in southern Jiangxi, western Fujian, and Guangdong provinces. The rare earth content of ion adsorption type ores in several major deposits of southern Jiangxi and western Fujian provinces are given in Table 2.5. These deposits are sp ecial in that they are characterized by low cerium and high neodymium, samari um, europium, gadolinium, and terbium or high yttrium contents. So, depending on the rare earth element required, the deposits may be selectively mined. The grades of ion adso rption type deposits are the lowest (0.05 to 0.2% REO) among the various rare earth depos its in China. This however is offset by the easier mining and beneficiation of these deposits. Placers Placer deposits containing monazite and xenotime occur at many locations in China (Clark and Zheng 1991). The principal pl acer deposits are located along the coastal areas of west Guangdong and Hainan Isla nd. The Nanshanhai deposit of Guangdong extends from the east to the west for about 9 km. It is 1.4 km wide and has an average thickness of 3.24 m. In addition to monazi te (44,000 metric tons) and xenotime (8200 metric tons), zircon and ilmenite occur in the deposit. Reserves of monazite, equal in extent to that mentioned above, occur in fluvial an d lacustrine placer deposits found widespread in Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Jiangxi prov inces. The average grade of placer deposits in China is 0.5 to 1.0% REO. Other Deposits Rare earth-bearing carbonatite deposits associated with alkaline rocks have been found in Taohualashan, Northern Nei Monggol, Zhushan, northwestern Hubei, Weishan, southern Shandong, and Xichang, Sichuan (Clark and Zheng 1991). The main producing mine among these is the Weishan mi ne in Shandong Province. The principal ore mineral in this mine is bastnasite.02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 86 A massive alkaline igneous type rare eart h deposit has been discovered recently in Mianning county, southwestern Sichuan. The or e body consists of mainly bastnasite with small amounts of parisite, chernovite, and xe notime. The metals lead, molybdenum, and bis- muth occur in association with the rare earth minerals. This deposit is considered attractive because it is easy to beneficiat e and low in thorium content. Apatites enriched in rare earths occur over the western part of China. The levels of REO are, however, too low for commercial recovery. 2.6.7 Germany Heavy mineral sands deposits, similar to those in the east coast of Australia, occur at Cux- haven in the North Sea coast, Germany. Reserv es have been estimated at 10 million metric tons of heavy minerals, including ilmeni te, rutile, zircon, and possibly monazite (Hedrick 1985a). 2.6.8 India A large variety of rare earth deposits occur in India of both the hard rock and placer types. Hard Rock Deposits Rare earth minerals in large co ncentrations occur in pegmatites in the states of Bihar, Rajast han, and Andhra Pradesh, and in hydrothermally altered form- ations, particularly those associated with car bonatites, in the states of Rajasthan, Tamil- nadu, and Gujarat. Vast occurrences of allanite within the gr anitic rocks are known in the districts of Madurai and Tirunelveli in Tamilnadu and in parts of Mayurbhanj and Koraput districts of Orissa. Allanite, even though it contains much less total REO (10 to 30%) than many other minerals, may best be reckoned in India as a po tential source of rare earths in view of their extensive occurrence. Many of the allanites from parts of Bihar and Tamilnadu have been found to contain small amounts of europium and samarium. The Kanyaluka deposit in the Singhbhum district of Bihar contains pegmatites rich in xenotime. The deposits of uranium ore from Jaduguda contain appreciable amount s of dysprosium and gadolinium. Gadolinite occurs in the Mayurbhanj district of Orissa, and in the Madurai and Salem districts of Tamilnadu. Chevkinite occurs in parts of Or issa and Karnataka; uranothorite occurs in parts of Karnataka, Tamilnadu, and Uttar Pr adesh; and rare earth-bearing pyrochlore and zircon occur in the north Arcot district of Tamilnadu and in the sandstones of Madhya Pradesh, respectively. Yttrium occurs in association with lantha nides and like them is characteristic of granite pegmatites. These deposits occur in th e (1) Rajasthan and Bihar pegmatite belt; (2) Kanyaluka, and Singhbhum district of Bihar; (3) Syenite pegmatites and alkali rocks like the carbonatites of Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Ta milnadu and, possibly, (4) in certain locations in Andhra Pradesh. Placers The most important rare earth deposit s of India are the beach sand deposits that contain monazite in addition to ilmenite, rutile, zircon, sillimanite, and garnet. India occupies an important place in the reserves of beach sand deposits and ranks second only to Australia. There are five major rare earth placer deposits, of which four are in coastal areas. The fifth placer, yet unworked, is inland. The rare earths in the Indian placer deposits have been estimated at 2.7 million metric tons REO, placing India in the fifth position after02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 87 China, Namibia, the United States, and Australia in the order of countries having the largest amounts of REO. The rare earth placer deposits in India ar e found in the southwestern coast of the peninsula at Manavalakurichi in Tamilnadu, Ch avara in Kerala, and on the eastern coast in Gopalpur in Orissa. The Chavara beach depo sits extend over a stretch of 22 km from Kayamkulam in the north to Neendakara in the south. The Manavalakurichi beach deposits extend to about 2 km in length from the mout h of the river Valliar touching Kadiapatnam village to the village Chinnavilai. Apart from the rich seasonal washings on the beach, the dunes containing relatively higher percentage of silica form an important source. Extensive dune sand deposits occur along the south Oris sa coast over a stretch of about 150 km. Of the several deposits located, the one close to Chatrapur is an extensive single deposit with the highest grade of heavy minerals. It runs over a coast length of nearly 18 km, covering a total area of over 26 square km between Go palpur in the south and the Rushikulya river in the north. In addition to the main depo sits described above, extensive heavy mineral deposits also occur on the coasts of Andhra Pr adesh and Maharashtra. It is reported (Jackson and Christiansen 1993) that resources on the coastal placers of India may be under- estimated because the beach sands are replen ished by annual monsoons. Rare earths also occur in the inland placer deposits at Ranchi in Bihar state and at Purulia in West Bengal state. 2.6.9 Indonesia In Indonesia, the important rare earth resource is xenotime, occurring in the cassiterite rich placers in the Tin Islands, Belitung, Bangka, Tujuh Archipelago, Singkap, Kundur and Karimun, which form part of the southern exte nsion of the Tin belt of southeast Asia. The deposits of the Belitung island are the most important. The total reserves of monazite and xenotime in cassiterite placers of the Tin is lands have been estimated at approximately 5000 metric tons. No actual mi ning or processing for rare earth recovery appears to have been carried out. 2.6.10 Japan In Japan the titanium mineral sphene, containing rare earths, has been found (Ito 1991) in the syenitic rocks around the periphery of the Kamioka lead–zinc mine. The deposit is a holocrystalline syenitic rock that is composed essentially of diopside, feldspar, quartz with accessory sphene, apatite, epidote, calcite, am phibole, sphalerite, and others. The sphene content of the deposit is approximately 4 to 7% and the total rare earth content of the spheneis ~1.1% REO. Sphene is not commercially pro cessed at present anywhere. It is a refractory and chemically stable silicate mineral. 2.6.11 Malaysia Alluvial tin deposits in Malaysia contain cas siterite as the main economic mineral and, in addition, several other minerals such as ilmenite, monazite, xenotime, and zircon. Cassiterite and the associated minerals usua lly occur as free grains liberated from one02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 88 another due to the natural breakdown process from the primary ore body. Monazite, xeno- time, ilmenite, and zircon’s cont ents are highly variable and depend on the location of the deposit. Data are available usually for the comp osition of tin tailings generated in mineral benefication for cassiterite, known locally as “amang.” Alluvial tin deposits occur in various states in Malaysia, and the deposits in the Kinta valley of the Perak state are considered impo rtant. Analysis of an amang sample from this valley is given (Hussin et al. 1991) in Table 2.10. The highest percentage of xenotime is fou nd in the deposits at Jelepang (5%) and at Batu Gajah (3%) in the Kinta valley. The mo nazite content in the amang from Batu Gajah is 10% whereas no monazite is present in the amang from Jelepang. Similarly the deposit in the state of Terengganu contains about 2% monazite but no xenotime. Even in some areas of Perak, as well as in the state of Selangor, xenotime presence does not exceed trace levels. By and large, monazite occurrence is more prevalent in amang but useful quantities of xenotime are present. On average, Malaysian monazite (Sulaiman 1991) contains 25% Ce2O3, 2% Sm2O3, 2% Y2O3, 27% phosphate, 6% ThO2, and 0.2% U3O8. A typical analysis of Malaysian xenotime is 35% Y2O3, 4% Dy2O3, 4% Yb2O3, 29% phosphate, 0.7% ThO2, and 1.6% U3O8. Total rare earth reserves in Malaysia have been estimated (Kanazawa and Miyawaki 1991) at a modest 30,000 metric tons REO. 2.6.12 Malawi Many rare earth minerals, including the common monazite and bastnasite and the less common synchysite and florencite, are found in Malawi. They occur in carbonatites in the Chilwa province of southern Malawi (Malunga et al. 1991). Kangankunde Monazite in exploitable quantities occurs in Kangankunde carbonatite. Monazite is found as a pale green to colorl ess mineral disseminated throughout the carbo- natite, in carbonatized fledspathic rocks, and in the surrounding eluvial soils. The monazite is poor in thoria. The rare earth content in the carbonatite ranges from 1.6 to 16.2% REOTable 2.10 Analysis of an “amang” sample from Kinta Valley, Malaysia (Hussin et al. 1991) Minerals Percentage Ilmenite 59.6 Hydroilmenite 7.9 Quartz 12.2Topaz 7.7 Tourmaline 4.6 Siderite 2.5Rutile 2.4 Garnet 1.3 Pyrite 0.7 Xenotime 0.5 Zircon 0.4Monazite 0.2 Cassiterite trace02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 89 with an average content of 10% REO. Th e mean percentage concentrations of Sm2O3 (1.43), Eu2O3 (0.17), and Y2O3 (0.10) compare favorably with Mountain Pass bastnasite. An estimated 13,000 metric tons of mo nazite occur to a depth of 30 meters. Nanthace Hill The minerals synchysite and bastnas ite occur in Nanthace Hill as dis- seminated needles, 0.2 to 1 mm long, in sideri tic carbonatite. The grade is 1 to 3.6% REO. Three mineralized zones, more than 10 m thick, within the apatite and carbonatite contain 600,000 metric tons of ore with 1. 7% REO up to a depth of 50 m. The apatite carbonatite of Nanthace Hill bear s higher concentrations of yttrium and europium. The total REO content of apa tite crystals ranges from 0.5 to 1.25%. Songwe In the Songwe carbonatite, the main mi neralization is that of synchysite or bastnasite. Mineralized zones with thicknesses of more than 10 m sh ow an REO content of more than 1%. Within 50 m depth, 1.4 million metric tons with 1.7% REO has been proved. Chilwa Island The minerals synchysite and florenci te occur as disseminated fibrous aggregates in the Chilwa Island carbonatite. In the central core of the sideritic carbonatite, the rare earth content is 5% REO. The mean Sm2O3, Eu2O3, and Y2O3 contents are 2.20, 0.47, and 1.64%, respectively. The sideritic carbonatite of the Chilwa is land contains apatite and pyrochlore. This apatite contains lanthanum (7.12%) and cerium (13.7%), while pyrochlore contains cerium (1.3–2.76%). 2.6.13 Mozambique Placer deposits of heavy minerals including monazite occur in Mozambique at Congolone, which is on the coast, 15 km north of Angoch e. The deposit consists of dredgeable reserves of 167 million metric tons gr ading 3.25% heavy minerals. The 5.42 million metric tons of heavy minerals in the reserve includ e 11,000 metric tons of monazite (RICI 1990). 2.6.14 MyanmarIn Myanmar monazite and xenotime occur asso ciated with placer cassiterite and wolframite deposits. Columbite and tantalite also occur in these deposits, which are found in the Dawei and Myeik areas of southern Myanmar (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). 2.6.15 New ZealandThere are two placer deposits on the west coas t of south island at Westport and Barrytown. These deposits contain ilmenite, rutile, zi rcon, and monazite like many other marine placers. Additionally, they contain magn etite, cassiterite, gold, and scheelite (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). The monazite reserves are considered modest. 2.6.16 PeruAn alluvial mineral sands ore body that cont ains cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, and other rare earths occurs near Tacna in Peru. This ore body contains titanomagnetite and asso- ciated minerals (RIC 1997).02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 90 2.6.17 South Africa With more than 1 million metric tons of RE O contained in South African rare earth depo- sits, the country potentially is a major producer of rare earths. There are three deposits; two of them are hard rock type and one is a placer . All three deposits are very large. At the Phalaborwa complex, the fluorapatite, 3Ca3(PO4)2·CaF2, deposits contain a significant amount of rare earths, typically 0.5–1.0% RE O. The proportions of europium, samarium, and neodymium are considerably higher in Phalaborwa apatite (Eu 1.1, Sm 5.0 and Nd 13%). An advantage of apatite as a source of ra re earth products is the absence of thorium. The safe disposal of the radioactive elem ent thorium is a vexation to monazite-based processes. Monazite occurs in the fluorspa r deposit at Buffalo fluorspar. Richards Bay beach sand deposit contains ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and magnetite in addition to monazite. The hard rock monazite deposits at Van Rh ynsdorp and Naboomspruit have been notable among the world’s primary monazite deposits. 2.6.18 Sri Lanka Substantial deposits of heavy mineral sands occur concentrated along the beach on the northeast coastline centered at Pulmoddai, 56 km north of the Trinconamalee port (Panditharatna 1991). The deposits occur ov er a stretch 9 km long, and 360 m wide. The mineral reserves of Pulmoddai have been esti mated to be approximately 3.7 million metric tons. The Sri Lankan mineral sands have the distinction of being the richest in heavy minerals content. The heavy mineral content is in the range 60–75%, and the constituent minerals are ilmenite 70–80%, rutile 8–1 0%, zircon 8–10%, and monazite 0.2%. Interestingly, Pulmoddai’s offshore deposits have been estimated to be between 0.95 and 1.34 million metric tons. It has also been esti mated that about 14 to 16% of the quantity of heavy minerals mined are added to the depos its by accretion due to wave action during the monsoon season every year. 2.6.19 Taiwan Heavy mineral sands deposits occur along th e southwest coast of Taiwan. About 550,000 metric tons of mineral sands, containing abou t 10% black monazite, have been reported in this deposit (Miao and Horng 1988). The black mon azite is primarily composed of rare earth phosphate and silica and also contains zirconium, titanium, uranium, and thorium as minor constituents. The Taiwan black monazite is particularly low in thorium, containing only 0.41% ThO2. The composition of this monazite vis-à-vis the minerals from Australia and India is shown in Tabl e 2.11. The main difference between the black and yellow monazite are the silica and thorium contents. 2.6.20 Thailand Rare earth mineral deposits of both primary and secondary origins occur in Thailand in a wide range of geological environments. Monazi te is the most common rare earth mineral in Thailand, and the occurrences of xenotime and microlite are also important. Significant quantities of monazite and small amounts of xenotime are invariably associated with tin and tungsten deposits. 02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 91 Both hard rock and placer deposits occur in Thailand. The hard rock deposits include “disseminated” rare earth-bearing lithophile granitoids and stockworks, rare earth-bearing tin pegmatites, rare earth-bearing quartz vein s and rare earth-bearing skarns and skarnoids. The placer deposits include al luvial placer deposits, recen t and old beach sand deposits, near and offshore deposits, and weathering crus t deposits. The grades of rare earth ores in these deposits have been estimated to vary from low (<0.001% RE minerals) for most primary deposits, and intermediate (0.01–0 .001%) for pegmatite and alluvial placer deposits, to high (>0.01%) for weathering cr ust and placer deposits. The ore tonnages are considered to be small for the quartz vein , skarn type, and weathering crust deposits, intermediate for alluvial placer deposits, an d large for disseminated granitic–pegmatitic and near offshore deposits. Much of the cassiterite deposits of the Thai Peninsula are located in the western granit- ic belt (Pungrassami and Sanguansai 1991). The primary sources of tin, tungsten, and associated heavy minerals are pneumatolytic granite, pegmatite, apatite, and hydrothermal quartz veins. Beach sand deposits occur in Changwat Prachuap, Khiri Khan, and Changwat Chumphon. Monazite–cassiterite ratio in th ese deposits ranges 0.0011–0.5203 and the xenotime–cassiterite ratio ranges 0.00–0.0194. The reserves of cassiterite, monazite, and xenotime from the mines in the granitic be lts and from offshore are only modest. 2.6.21 Turkey A bastnasite deposit is in midwest Turkey near Eskisehir. This deposit also contains barytes and fluorite and is large enough to support an annual output of 12,000 metric tons REO. 2.6.22 United States Before the discovery of the huge rare earth de posits at Bayan Obo, China, the United States was ranked first as the country with the great est amount of REO in it s resources. With the identification of massive quantities of bastnas ite deposits in Namibia, the African country took the second rank, and presently the Unit ed States ranks third among the seven major countries in terms of REO contained in their resources. In the United States there are 32 monazite and 3 bastnasite deposits in addition to 5 deposits containing other rare earth minerals (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). Rare earth deposits occur distributed across the United St ates from inland California to the lower east coast.Table 2.11 Composition of monazite, wt % Australian monazite from Eneabba Co., Australia.

Out of the 40 rare earth deposits in the United States, only 13 are placer deposits of which 8 are fluvial placers and 5 are marine placers. Monazite occurs with ilmenite, zircon, magnetite, and other minerals in these deposits. Monazite fro m stream placers in Idaho are re latively low in thorium. The composition of a commercial monazite concentrate from Idaho was given in Table 2.4. Monazite from Florida contains about 4% ThO2 which is much less than the thorium contents of monazite from Brazil (6% ThO2) and India (8% ThO2). Recently, beach sand deposits at Green Cove Springs, Florida, have been important. Most of the monazite deposits in the United States are, however, hard rock deposits. On the other hand, the mineral euxenite occurs in a placer deposit at Bear Valley, Idaho (Kremers 1961, Jackson and Christiansen 1993). Mineralized zones containing monazite and xenotime, containing an estimated combined REO equivalent tonnage of 2.5 millio n tons for every 30 meters of mining, with the structure reportedly 120 meters deep to the base of the synclinal trough, occur throughout Music Valley located in Riverside County, California. Bastnasite was not a well-known rare earth mineral until the discovery in 1949 of a large bastnasite deposit in Mountain Pass, California (Olson et al. 1952, Evans 1966). The Mountain Pass ore body is located near the west center of a block of pre-Cambrian meta- morphic rocks composed of granite–biotite–g arnet–hornblende–gneisses and schists that are cut by pegmatites and other dikes. Large areas of potash-rich igneous rocks, syneite,and shonkinite intrude into this complex, and next to these is the intrusion of rare earth-bearing carbonatite, which is also of pr e-Cambrian age. Three principal rock types, namely, calcite — pink barite, dolomite, and s ilicified carbonate, form the carbonatite ore body. The minerals contained are, appr oximately, calcite/dolomite/ankerite, 50%; barite/celesite/ strontianite, 3%; bastnasite, 12%; and silica, 8%. The bastnasite ore body at Mountain Pass extends 750 m along a NW-SE strike, and dips 40 SW with an average thickness of 60 m. The deposit contains over 30 million metric tons proven and probable ore based on a 5% cu t-off. The average rare earth content is 8.9% REO (Wilson 1991). In the United States, rare earth-bearing apat ites occur at several locations (Altschuler et al. 1967, Hedrick 1986), including the ir on ores of Mineville, New York, California (placers), and Florida. The rare earth-containing apatite at Mineville occurs associated withmagnetite ore in metamorphosed sedimentary an d igneous rocks. The rare earth content of the apatite averages 11.1% REO (range 3–35%). It also contains thorium (average 0.15%,range 0.01–0.33%) and uranium (average 0.032%, range 0.015–0.2%) (McKeown and Klamic 1959). In the same way that RE 3+ is substituted, the Ca2+ in the apatite crystal lattice can also be proxied by Th4+ and U4+. The rare earths in the apatite include all elements except Pm and Tb. The contents of Ce, La, Nd, and Y are especially higher. The sedimentary phosphate rocks of Florida contain about 0.024% Y2O3 and in total 0.05% total rare earths (Weterings and Janssen 1985). These rocks also contain uranium and vanadium. Phosphorite samples from th e large phosphoria formation of Idaho, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming average 0.16% ra re earths (~0.06% La, Nd etc., and 0.1% Y) (Aplan 1988). In the United States a deposit occurs near Mescalero, New Mexico, that contains not only yttrium, but also zirconium in a silicate mineral called eudialyte (Kilbourn 1990). The lanthanide elements are contained in complex mineralizations, such as in the eudialyte, in many of the hard rock resources identified in the United States and elsewhere in the world.02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 93 2.6.23 Former USSR Phosphate rocks of magmatic origin occurring at the Kola Peninsula of the former Soviet Union hold a considerable amount of yttrium and other rare earths. The yttrium content of Kola apatite averages 0.04% Y2O3 in the total rare earth co ntent averaging 1% REO. Rare earth-bearing apatite deposits also occur at Vishnevye Mountains, and the rare earth content is more than 1% REO. Uraniferous phosphates containing rare earths occur at Schevchenko in Kazakhsthan. The reserves, ho wever, are limited. A fluorocarbonate rich in yttric rare earths, yttrosynchisite, occurs in Kutessiak deposit, but reserves are limited. Deposits of rare earths are also found in Dn ieprodzerzhinsk in the Ukraine, but the nature of this deposit is not known. Large deposits of the mineral loparite occur in Russia’s Kola Peninsula adjacent to Finland. Loparite ores are rich in light rare earths, and the rare earth content is 32–34% REO. In addition, loparite contains 39 to 40% TiO2, 8–10% (Nb, Ta)2O5, 4–5% CaO, and 8–9% Nb2O3. Loparite supplies the bulk of the CI S demand for the rare earth (Kosynkin et al. 1993). 2.6.24 Venezuela Usable deposits of rare earths and niobiu m have been reported at Cerro Impacto (Hedrick 1985a), 190 km southwest of Cindad Bolivar, Bo livar state. Intense weathering, as a result of the country’s tropical climate, has leached the original carbonatite source rock to result in thick lateritic beds enriched in rare earth s and other elements. Rare earth contents range from 0.1 to 11%. 2.6.25 Vietnam In Vietnam, the most important rare earth de posit occurs at Nam Na m Xe situated at the northwestern part of the country (Tirnh 1991). The Nam Nam Xe rare earth deposit belongs to the hydrothermal–metasomatic type. The de posit occurs as a series of barite–barito- celestite rare earth carbonate veins. These veins vary in thickness from a few centimeters up to about four meters. They are 200 to 10 00 meters long. The rare earth content varies from 1.2 to 36.2% with an average of 9–13%. In addition to rare earths, the deposit contains significant amounts of minerals such as baritocelestite and barite. There are more than 35 minerals in the Na m Nam Xe deposit. The main minerals are bastnasite, parisite, synchisite, baritocelestit e, barite, and the secondary minerals are calcite, ankerite, monazite, ortite, siderite, pyrite, galena, apatite, fluorite, phlogopite, limonite, magnetite, chlorite, and monmorrillon ite. All the minerals are closely intergrown. The ore is reported to be easy to process for recovery of rare earth, strontium, and barium; however, no actual mining and proces sing for rare earth appears to have been carried out. 2.6.26 Zaire Monazite is found in several tin an d gold deposits in the Kivu region (Hedrick 1985a), Zaire. Reserves of monazite in the Obaye mini ng sector occur in two separate deposits. The02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 94 Kabengelwa deposit contains about 2000 metric tons of monazite (e quivalent to about 600 metric tons of REO) in ore grading 2.8 kg of heavy mineral sands per cubic meter. The Mashabuto deposit reportedly contains 45 metric tons of monazite (e quivalent to 25 metric tons of REO) in ore grading 3 kgs of heavy minerals per cubic meter. 2.7 BY-PRODUCTS AND CO-PRODUCTS In spite of the large identified world resour ces of rare earths, their production and supply have been strongly influenced by the natu re of rare earths mineralization. Commercial mine production of rare earths is feasible in most of the cases only as a co-product or by-product of some other mineral value. The reas on for this is that the concentration of rare earths in its reserves is so low that the extrac tion of rare earths alone is not economical since the current market value of the rare earth s cannot support entire ly the mining and production costs involved in such an operation. When rare earth is extracted as a co-produ ct, the market value of the main product supports the cost of extraction of the rare earth, and the recovery of rare earths in turn makes the recovery of the main product economi cally more attractive. There is a sharing of mining and production costs between a co-pr oduct and a main product, the latter carrying a major share of the overall cost burden. When rare earths are recovered as a by-product, the situation is the same as that of its recove ry as a co-product except that the recovery and sale of by-product rare earths is not a necessa ry condition for making the recovery and the sale of the main product economically viable. The recovery of rare earths as the prim ary product has been carried out from the Mountain Pass, CA, bastnasite deposit. In f act the Mountain Pass mine is the only active mine in the western world opera ted exclusively for the recovery of rare earths as no com- mercial co-products or by-products are reclaimed (Wilson 1991). There is a possibility of recovering rare earth as the main product in at least three deposits in Australia: Mt. Weld, Yangibana, and John Galt (Taylor 1991). Historically, the only country where monazite recovery has been the purpose of mining beach sand deposits is Brazil. The principal attraction is the thorium content of monazite. In fact, all over the world monazite was form erly mined solely for its thorium content (3–9%). Since 1920, however, the rare earth c ontent of the ore has been of greater import- ance. From placer deposits of heavy mineral sa nds, rare earth has been invariably recovered as a by-product of ilmenite production in most of the cases, and as a by-product of cassiterite mining in southeast Asia, and in some cases as a by-product of placer gold (Aplan 1988). Rare earths have been recovered as a by -product of uranium extraction at Denison Mines, Elliot Lake in Canada. Much of the wo rld’s rare earth production comes from its re- covery as a by-product of iron ore mining at Bayan Obo, China. In the former Soviet Union, the supply of rare earth bearing mineral lopa rite is associated with the large titanium recovery operations in the Kola Peninsula. A large potential exists for the recovery of rare earths from apatite as a by-product of phosphoric acid production from various locations in the world. Rare earths can be by-products if pe rovskites are ever processed for titanium re- covery. True to its status as a by-product, the recovery of rare earths has not been a constant feature of the main product recovery in most of the cases, resulting in rare earth rich tailings being accumulated for possible future recovery . These tailings may in the future be pro- cessed for rare earth recovery, which would then assume the status of a pseudo main product.02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 95 The extraction of rare earths from anatase co ncentrates in Brazil has been cited as an example of possible new by-product sources of rare earths. Another example is the possibil- ity of by-product rare earths production from the Olympic Dam copper–uranium– gold mine in South Australia. The recovery of rare earths as a co-product could be carried out in the processing of two of the Australian resources. The ore minera ls of the Brockman deposit are very fine grained and not amenable to physical benefici ation to obtain concentration of any of the valuable minerals. Processing would therefor e involve fine milling and chemical dissol- ution and separation by solvent extraction. Ther e is the possibility therefore of recovery of values like ceramic grade alumina and zircon ia with the production of yttrium and rare earths as co-products. The Toongi deposit in New South Wales is another suitable project for recovery of rare earths as co-product along with zirconia, tantalum, and niobium. 2.8 WORLD RARE EARTH PRODUCTION AND A V AILABILITY The status of world rare earth deposits and production from these are shown in Table 2.12 (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). Commercial production of rare earths began in the 1880swith the mining in Sweden and Norway of the rare earth thorium phosphate mineral monazite. This was to provide material for th e production of the incandescent lamp mantle invented by Welsback in 1884. Initially the oxides of zirconium, lanthanum and ytterbium were used. Later, improvements in the mantle required oxides of thorium and cerium forthe mantle with small amounts of neodymium and praseodymium for marking an indelible brand name label in the mantle (Hedrick 2000). The published data on world rare earth pr oduction over the past 100 years are plotted in Figure 2.3. The picture during the thirty years (1965–1995) when world rare earth production was derived from many countries is given in Figure 2.4. Global rare earth production over the fifty year period, 1950 to 2000, showing the dominance of different type of resources, appears in Figure 2.5. Th e most recent ten year mine production details appear in Table 2.13. Regular commercial mini ng of rare earth reserves began approxi- mately 100 years ago (Parker and Baroch 1971). India and Brazil were the principal sources of world rare earth supply, with the United St ates occasionally contri buting, until the late 1940s, when Australia and Malaysia also st arted regular production. Much of the world rare earth supply between 1950 and 1985 came from the United States, which was the leading producer, and from Aust ralia, which was the second. By 1985, however, China rose to second place, and by 1988 it overtook the United States to become the world’s leading producer. China, the United States, the former Soviet Union, Australia, India, Brazil, and Malaysia have all been major rare earth pr oducing countries with South Africa, Canada, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and Zaire contributing occasional or smaller amounts to world rare earth production (Jackson and Christ iansen 1993, Hedrick 1995, Hedrick 1997). Monazite was the major rare earth resource from the beginning of the industry until Thereafter bastnasite production equaled or exceeded monazite production. Atpresent, bastnasite is the world’s major source of rare earths. It constituted 62% of world output of rare earth minerals in 1989 and the proportion rose to very high levels starting in 1994–1995 (Hedrick 1995, Hedrick 1997). Inci dentally, no bastnasite was produced before the 1950s.page 95 is a disconnected page02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm We dnesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 96 Table 2.12

fraction (La, Ce, Pr, Nd) constitutes more than 90% of the total rare earth content while the other rare earth elements make up 5 to 10%. The rare earth content of bastnasite concentrate is constituted by as much as 99% of light rare earths (La–Nd), almost no heavy rare earths, and very little yttrium. Up to 60% of the rare earth content of xenotime is yttria, and it also has a higher proportion of the other heavy rare earths than monazite.

This picture started changing somewhat in the 1980s with the io n adsorption type ores from China also con- tributing to world rare earth production and becoming the principal source for heavy metals. Taylor (1991) estimated the world rare earth production in 1989 at 50,000 metric tons of REO with 50% of this total constituted by bastnasite, 40% by monazite, and the balance mainly from the ion adsorbing clay ores foun d in China. By 2000, the quantity of REO produced from monazite source is less than 5% of the total REO produced from all sources. By 2002 over 80% of all REO produced is from bastnasite, about 10% from ion adsorption ores, 5% from monazite and the remaining from other sources such as xenotime, loparite and brannerite. In the 1990s, however, monaz ite was a declining source of rare earths with production practically coming to a halt in Au stralia — the principal monazite producer in the world (Hedrick 1997). The declining importa nce of monazite as a raw material has been due to growing supplies of bastnasite from Ch ina and also due to problems associated with the disposal of the radioactive element thoriu m contained in monazite. There is similarly a decline in the production of xenotime, as well, from the main producer Malaysia. The decreased supply of traditional minerals enha nced the importance of the “other ores” and their contribution to world produc tion of mid and heavy rare earths. 2.8.1 Brazil In Brazil, out of 16 rare earth deposits, only 4 are known to be operating at present and 2 of these are making monazite concentrates. The status of the other 12 projects is not known (Jackson and Christiansen 1993).

This is in contrast to the objectives of placer mining in other count ries where monazite is consid- ered only as a by-product wi th ilmenite the primary product. The rare earth production in Brazil started declining significantly in the 1990s and no significant production was re- ported from 1996 onwards. Annual production of a modest 200 tons REO has been reported from the year 2001. It is produced in the states of Espirito Sa nto, Parana, and Rio de Janeiro (Hedrick 1985). Production was also started in the heavy mineral sands deposit at Cumuru- xatiba in Bahia state, where monazite along w ith ilmenite, rutile, and zircon was recovered. Monazite was first produced in 1885 in Brazil from beach sand deposits. These deposits occurring over a stretch of 200 km on the southeast coast of Brazil were at places so rich in monazite that thei r exploitation was possible a nd actually easily performed using primitive technical resources. Such rich deposi ts were only a small fraction of total rare earth occurrence in Brazil and these were exha usted even before 1950. In 1950, systematic exploitation of sands, which are relatively poorer in monazite and more complex in composition, started. The new projects underway in Brazil includ e the dredging oper ation on the Sapucai River, which would be producing 1600 metric to ns per year of monazite, equivalent to 900 metric tons per year of REO, and the phos phate mine at Tapira where the rare earth recovery plant would be producing 25 3 metric tons per year of REO. 2.8.2 India Mining of Indian beach sand deposits for reco vering monazite values started in 1911. Prior to World War II, much of world rare earth supply was derived from Indian deposits in addition to Brazilian sources. Out of the five major rare earth mineral b earing placer deposits in India, four are in production and all of these are in coastal areas . The fifth placer, yet unworked, is inland and removed from the necessary infrastructure. Three of the operating projects, Chavara in Kerala, Manavalakurichi in Tamil Nadu, and Ch atrapur in Orissa, are owned by the Govern- ment of India and another project at Chavara is owned by the Government of Kerala. Almost all of the minerals in the beach sands, ilmenite , rutile, zircon, garnet, sillimanite, leucoxene, magnetite, and monazite, are recovered. Curre ntly, the annual REO production in India is about 3000 metric tons (Hedrick 1997). 2.8.3 United States Production of rare earths started in the United States in 1887, two years after the beginning of world rare earth production in Brazil, from placer deposits in Burke County, North Carolina (Overstead et al. 1959) and cont inued until 1910. Since that time the only domestic production of monazite has been fro m placer deposits in Idaho and Florida. The production was not very significant between 1910 until the time of World War II because during that period the U.S. imported almost all the monazite it processed principally from India and Brazil. Due to the war, both India and Brazil had restricted export of monazite, possibly for preserving the nuclear fuel ma terial thorium for their own future energy requirements and also for building domestic rare earth processing industries (Kleber and Love 1963). This cut-off of major suppli es led to exploration in the U.S., and to identification and development of several la rge deposits. The U.S. emerged as a major02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm Wednesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 120 producer of rare earths with the discovery an d development of the Mountain Pass bastnasite deposit in 1949. Monazite production also rest arted in 1948 with the recovery of monazite as a by-product of mining Florida beach sand s for titanium minerals and zircon. Since the early 1950s, monazite production was a part of very large scale operations for the separation of gold and ilmenite. Mining for ru tile, garnet, zircon, and other minerals was conducted in the states of California, Colora do, Georgia, Florida, Idaho, and the Carolinas. In recent times, these operations have been ma inly confined to Florida and South Carolina. The U.S. emerged as the major producer of rare earths with the discovery of the Mountain Pass bastnasite deposit in 1949 a nd its subsequent development. Since that time the Mountain Pass mine has been the major and most important provider of rare earths in the U.S., and until the mid 1980s the only so urce of commercial bastnasite in the world. The only domestic source of REE for the U.S., the mine at Mountain Pass has operatedbelow capacity and only intermit tently over the past several years. This has been caused to a certain extent by local environmental and re gulatory problems but to a large extent by global rare earth market factors which pose a threat to the long-ter m viability of Mountain Pass as a supplier of REE for high technolo gy applications. By 1999 and 2000 nearly all (more than 90%) of separated REE used in the U.S is from Chinese rare earth resources. Up to the end of 1994, monazite was produ ced in Florida at Green Cove Springs by RGC (U.S.) Minerals Inc., a subsidiary of the Australian company Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd. (RGC) as a by-product of ilmenite production from beach sands. The recovery of monazite ceased at the end of 1994 as world demand for radioactive thorium-bearing rare earth ores decreased, primarily due to increased thorium disposal cost. The first U.S. source known to have produced commercial quantities of xenotime is the Marion, North Carolina, gold mine (RIC I 1990). The mixed heavy minerals sands concentrate produced in the mine contains monazite as its major constituent with lesser amounts of zircon and xenotime. Producti on started in 1989; however, no current production is indicated (Hedrick 1997). An increase in rare earth production by ne w sources is linked to the development of the eudialyte deposit at Pajarito in New Mexi co and production of monazite from the placer deposit at Maxville in Florida. Apatite rich tailings of the ir on ore at Mineville, New York, can be developed into a large source of yttr ium and other rare earths (Sabot and Maestro 1995). 2.8.4 Australia Australia has been the primary producer of monazite in the world. Regular monazite production started in the country in the late 1940s. Since 1967 Australian beach sand deposit was the major source of supply and until the late 1980s Australia continued to dominate, contributing nearly 37% of world mo nazite output. Australia has been the fourth largest producer of rare earths in the world af ter China, the United States, and the former Soviet Union (Hedrick 1997). Monazite was recovered in Australia in va rious localities as a by-product of beach sand mining for ilmenite, rutile, and zircon. In 1983, the proportion of by-product monazite production in Australia was 16,963 tonnes pe r million tonnes of ilmenite. In 1988, only 7373 tonnes of monazite was produced per million tonnes of ilmenite. Over the same period the annual monazite production in Australi a decreased from 15,0 00 to 12,000 tonnes (Taylor 1991).02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm Wednesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 121 In the 1990s, however, there was a decline in the Australian monazite production. Eneabba mineral sands deposit was the principa l source of monazite in Australia. In 1991 it was described as a declinin g source by Taylor (1991), who, however, stated that the development of additional mineral sands rese rves in the adjacent Eneabba west deposit could sustain the Eneabba production level in the immediate future. A major reason for the decrease in monazite production leading to near zero production from 1994 onwards was the decreased world demand for thorium-bearing rare earth concentrate. At Eneabba potential exists for the recovery of substantial quantities of xenotime from existing mineral sands operations (Taylor 19 91). Actual production, however, has been very little because of limited industrial requirements of unprocessed xenotime. Notwithstanding the current status of no ra re earth production, Australia remains one of the world’s major sources of rare earth elements from its heavy mineral sands and rare earth laterite deposits. A briefing on this is given in Section 2.9 on rare earth production potential. 2.8.5 China Mining has been going on in several rare earth deposits in China. Currently, Chinese rare earth supply comes from the Bayan Obo deposit of iron rare earth ore, bastnasite-bearing carbonatite comes from Mianning in Sich uan Province and Weishan in Shangdong Province, ion adsorption type clays are mine d in the south China provinces of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Fujian. Placer monazite and xenotime depos its at Guangdong and Hunan provinces are also probably operationa l (Hedrick 1997). Am ongst all these, the Bayan Obo deposit contributes to the major chun k of Chinese rare earth production and also supports the frequent large increases in th e country’s rare earth production levels. Mining of the Bayan Obo deposit began in 19 57 even though no rare earth production was reported from China prior to 1980. In th e 1980s, China emerged as the major producer of rare earths. Chinese mine production capaci ty was about 6000 metric tons REO in 1982 and rose phenomenally to over 20,000 me tric tons REO in 1985. Actual rare earth production itself increased fourfold between 1983 and 1989, from 600 0 metric tons REO to 25,220 metric tons REO. Significant new production from 1987 onward was realized from the ion adsorption type REO deposits of southern China. Rare earth production in China remained relatively low during 1990–1992 but started increasing, beginning in 1994. In 1994 produc tion was 30,650 metric tons REO, which was 39% more than the 1993 level of 22,100 metr ic tons REO. The production was mainly from the Bayan Obo mine. There was another sharp increase in rare earth production between1994 and 1995. In 1995 China was the leading producer of rare earths, producing a record 48,000 metric tons REO, an increase by about 57% of the previous level. In 1995 production of rare earths at Baotou was 26,905 metric tons REO, while Sichuan Province and Shang- dong Province produced 8500 metric tons REO and 963 metric tons REO, respectively. The production of rare earths from ion adsorption t ype clays in southern China’s provinces of Jiangxi, Guangalong, Hunan, and Fujian was 9770 metric tons REO (Hedrick 1997). The significant annual increased levels con tinued through 1996 to 2002, with only a slight decrease from the previous year’s le vel in 1997. Production picked up in 1998 crossing 60000 t REO, and the production of ra re earth concentrates in China was 70,000 t REO in 1999. By 2000 rare earth content of the iron ore mined at Bayan Obo ranged from 40,000 to 50,000 t/yr REO, and it usually accounts for the bulk of the frequent increase in02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm Wednesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 122 the production level as well. Annual levels in 2000 and 2001 were 73000 t REO and the figure for 2002 is 75000 t REO. Regional pr oduction in 1997 was as follows: Baotou, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region 35000 t REO; Shangdong Province 1200 t REO; Sichuan Province, 11000 t REO; Monazite concentrate production, all regions, 50 t REO, and ion adsorption clays, all regions, 6000 t (Hedrick 1997). The Baotou Iron and Steel Company (BISC) is by far the largest and most important rare earth producer in China. The ore dressing plant of BISC splits the ore from Bayan Obo into two usable fractions — one for rare ear th extraction and the ot her for iron smelting. Canadian-based Advanced Material Resources Ltd. (AMR), in a joint venture, produces rare earths from bastnasite-bearing carbonati te at Mianning, Sichuan Province. AMR is also involved in rare earth processing plan ts at Jiangyin, Jiangsu Province, and Zibo, Shangdong Province. In southern China, the major rare earth producer is the Zhujiang smelter. The raw materials for this plan t are xenotime and monazite from Guangdong placer deposits. Monazite is also availabl e from the Xun Wa and Long Nan mines near Nanchung in Kiangsi. Monazite, which is easily available in southern China, is used as the principal raw material in the Yao Lung chemi cal plant (Zhang et al. 1982). Alluvial placer deposits of monazite in the Hunan Province are processed by the Taojiang smelter. Ion adsorption type deposits are processed by the Jiangxi Rare Earth Company, Nanchang Rare Earth and the Ganjia Rare Earth Company. Ion adsorption ore of the Xunwu mine is processed by the Jiangnan Rare Earth material. There are many placer and ion adsorption clay deposits in China which could be mined. The Bayan Obo mine accounts for 95 % of REO reserves in China with the ion adsorption ores and other types representing 3% and 2%, respectively. While the Bayan Obo mine is essentially a produ cer of light rare earths, the ion adsorption ores are basically producers of both light and heavy rare eart hs. This factor can have a bearing on the production starting on these new projects. 2.8.6 Former Soviet Union The former Soviet Union is a major producer of rare earths and ranks fourth in the world in terms of annual rare earth output, af ter China, United States and India. Annual production that used to be in the range of over 8000 t REO until the early 1990s decreased to the 2000 t REO per year level by 19 94 and has remained so ever since. The main sources of rare earths in the former Soviet Union are loparite ores, yttrosyn- chisite, and uraniferous phosphates. Rare ear ths were first derived from loparite in 1934 and commercial mining of loparite started in 1951 at the Karnasurk mine of the Lovosersk Enrichment Works, Murmansk Oblast. Current production is by the Lovosersk Mining and Benefication Complex near Revda, Murmansk Oblast, Russia. (Hedrick et al. 1997). Loparite mined from the Kola Peninsula is tr eated at the Irtysh Chemical Metallurgical Plant in east Kazakhstan Oblast in Kazakhsta n and the Sillamjee Chemical Metallurgical United Works in Estonia. Uraniferous phosphates are mined at Schevchenko in Kazakhstan, but decrease in demand for uranium will lead to reduced supply from this source. The yttrosynchisite ores come from th e Kutessiak deposit and are treated at the Kirgiz works. The other rare earth sources in the country are apatit e and monazite. In the former Soviet Union a considerable quantity of monazite occurs, possibly at Samotkanskii and probably is produced but no production data are available. The status of apatite is similar. The recovery of rare earths from apat ite of the Kola Peninsula is likely to gain importance as these ores are a potent ial source of yttrium and europium.02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm Wednesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 123 Apart from the six major rare earth-producing countries mentioned above, world rare earth production is contribute d to by South Africa, Canada, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Zaire, and Madagascar (Jackson and Christiansen 1993, Hedrick 1997). 2.8.7 South Africa A unique vein deposit was discovered in 1950 at Van Rhynsdorp in th e Republic of South Africa. This remained a major source of mo nazite for the decade 1953–1963. A certain amount of rare earths has also been recove red from the Witwatersrand uranium deposit in South Africa (Highley et al. 1988). At presen t, in South Africa, there are three important major mines for REO ore minerals. At Buffalo fluorspar monazite occurs associated with fluorite and apatite, at the Phalaborwa comple x apatite is rare earth bearing, and Richards Bay placer deposit contains mon azite. Although all three mines are operating, monazite is not recovered at Buffalo fluorspar. Rare earths are not extracted from the apatite at Phalaborwa and only Richards Bay is recoveri ng a monazite by-product. Richards Bay is a major beach dredging operation producing zi rcon. The annual rare earth production in South Africa in 1994 was a modest 400 metric tons of REO (Hedrick 1995). 2.8.8 CanadaIn Canada rare earth has been produced as a by-product of uranium mining at Elliott Lake. A rare earth recovery plant had been in op eration intermittently between 1967 and 1978 and, after modernization, has been in operatio n since 1986 at the Denison Mines, Elliott Lake, Ontario, for the recovery of yttr ium and heavy rare earths from uranium leach solutions (Hedrick 1985). In 1988 nearly 100 metric tons of contained Y 2O3 was produced from the source (Robjohns 1989). No signifi cant production was reported in the 1990s (Hedrick 1995). A remote possibility exists for increasing the rare earth production in Canada by development of the Strange Lake deposit. This deposit, developed for its beryllium content, would yield about 4700 metric tons per year of REO as a by-product (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). 2.8.9 Malaysia Malaysia has been a rare earth producer from th e late 1940s. Monazite and more particular- ly xenotime have been obtained as by-pr oducts of placer cassiterite mining. Placer cassiterite deposits at Perak have been wo rked by Beh minerals/Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Ltd. for monazite and xenotime produ ction. Deposits at Perak and at Selangor, west Malaysia, have been mined to produ ce monazite and xenotime. The annual mine production of monazite and xenotime during the be st of times in Malaysia is given in Table 2.13. Annual production of rare earths in Ma laysia, which was only 187 metric tons REO in 1983, increased to 2563 metric tons REO in 1984 and to 3300 metric tons REO in 1985. Production remained steady until 1989, decreas ed to 1830 metric to ns REO in 1990, 1090 in 1991, 427 in 1992, and down to 224 metric tons REO in 1993. The declining production was to culminate in the closure of the Asian Rare Earth Sdn. Btd. Plant in Ipoh, Perak State, in the face of overwhelming compet ition from China (Min ing Journal 1994).02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm Wednesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 124 2.8.10 Thailand In Thailand monazite and xenotime are recove red as by-products from alluvial tin mining and offshore tin dredging. Approximately 80 –90% of the country’s production of tin concentrates is from the Thai Peninsula (Pu ngrassami and Sanguansai 1991). From 1971 to 1989 the total production of monazite an d xenotime in Thailand was 6400 metric tons, and 655 metric tons respectively. Almost 99% of this production was from the Thai Peninsula. Monazite is produced mainly fro m deposits of Changwat Phuket, Phangnga, Ranong, Surat Thani, Chumphon and Prachuap Khirikhan. Xenotime is produced mainly from deposits at Changwat Phuket, Phangn ga, Ranong Trang, and Prachuap Khirikhan. Annual production was less than 100 metr ic tons REO in 1983 but was about 150 metric tons REO during 1984 to 1986, and it increased to a steady 800 metric tons REO between 1987 and 1989. Production decreased to about 230 metric tons REO beginning in 1990 (Hedrick 1997). 2.8.11 Sri Lanka In Sri Lanka there is one placer deposit of heavy minerals in Pulmoddai, and this is an operating monazite property that produces mon azite concentrate. Monazite is recovered as a by-product during the processing and reco very of ilmenite, rutile, and zircon from this deposit. Production has been going on for many year s at a modest level of about 110 metric tons of REO per annum. Production was appr oximately three times this quantity in 1989. Production could be stepped up to 500 metric tons REO per year (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). 2.8.12 Zaire and Madagascar Zaire and Madagascar are the two countries reporting rare earth production in small quantities. Monazite is produced in Zaire, and both monazite and bastnasite are produced in Madagascar (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). In addition to the countries mentioned above, rare earth minerals are probably produced in Indonesia, North Korea, Mozambi que, and Vietnam even though the regularity and extents are unknown. The Congolone beach placer in Mozambique was considered a monazite deposit that could begin production immediately (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). 2.9 RARE EARTH PRODUCTION POTENTIAL Actual world rare earth production is much le ss than the world production potential. For example, for 1989 (the latest year for wh ich such data are available) potential REO production was 1,38,096 metric tons if the cu rrently operating mines had all produced REO instead of discarding or stockp iling it. Actual world rare earth production in 1989 was only 66,990 metric tons REO (Jackson and Christia nsen 1993). Even in 1994, the actual world mine production was 56,800 metric tons REO.02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm Wednesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 125 The principal potential rare earth producers are those placer operations where the objective is to recover titanium minerals an d discard the other minerals. Recovery of rare earth oxides was not carried out in hard rock operations either. For example, the Olympic Dam underground mine in Australia could po tentially produce about 5000 metric tons per year REO as a by-product of uranium recovery but has no plans to do this. Similarly, Canadian underground uranium mines have the potential for producing 610 metric tons per year of REO but actually produce only about 150 metric tons per year. About 41,000 metric tons per year of REO could be obtained fro m the Buffalo fluorspar mine and Phalaborwa copper–apatite mines in South Africa. In the Un ited States about 7000 metric tons per year of REO could be recovered from the operating open pit phosphate mines, if the producers considered it economical. In addition to considering the potential of the specific resources mentioned above, if the overall potential of all important resources is considered, the country having the greatest potential for REO production is South Africa. As compared to an actual annual production of about 400 metric tons REO, South Africa could produce about 41,300 metric tons per year. This would be an increase of approximat ely 100 times its present production. The U.S. has the potential to produce about 32,800 me tric tons REO per year, which is more than 50% over the average annual production in the best of times. China could undoubtedly produce more REO than is reported, for exam ple, by successfully treating Bayan Obo steel slag. Australia could produce a bout 11,500 metric tons REO per year, representing a more than 50% increase over the average annual production in better times, if Olympic Dam andsome other placer operators introduced rare earth mineral recovery plants. In Brazil also,the rare earth output could be easily raised by a factor of five, and in India output could go up by nearly 100%. This status with respect to important rare earth producers is given in Figure 2.6 (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). A nother aspect to be considered when dealing with potential and actual production is the deposit type. Of the actual 1989 world rare earthproduction, 41% came from placer sands and 59% from hard rock deposits. If the other operating mines that have potential for rare earth production are included, the relevant values become 27% of total production from placer sands and 73% from hard rock deposits. In other words, actual rare earth productio n from placer deposits could be raised by over 40% and the production from hard rock depo sits could be increased by nearly 170%. On the one hand the actual world rare earth production can be raised far beyond the current levels by fully realizing in practice the potential of each deposit currently worked. On the other hand, the exploitation of new deposits for actual pr oduction can be a more attractive alternative for increas ing the tonnage of REO produced. Worldwide there are many new projects that could start rare earth production within a few years. The highest number of such projects is in Australia. Many placer and hard rock projects are pending in Australia (Taylor 1991). One of them is the WIM-150, an inland dredging property. The development of the WIM-150 deposit poses a number of technical challeng es relating to the separation of fine grain minerals. The projected mining rate of 20 millio n metric tons per year of this deposit could result in the production of 12,000 metric tons per year of monazite and potentially up to 3000 metric tons per year of xenotime. The si ze of this resource is sufficient to support an operation on this scale for more than 30 years (Taylor 1991). The WIM deposit is potentially a major source of rare earth minerals; however, these minerals can be recovered only as by-pro ducts from the production of titanium minerals and zircon from this deposit. The Olympic Dam multimetal deposit in Sout h Australia for the production of copper,02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm Wednesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 126 uranium, and gold is a major resource with a po tential operating life of more than 100 years. At the best average scale of operation, the quan tity of rare earths mined in the ore may be of the order of 10,000 metric tons per year of REO content. The advantage of this situation is that the rare earths are already being mine d and the major economic minerals will support a long-term operation. Besides, the environmen tal problems of processing rare earth ores are circumvented in this operation because it already involves disposal of radioactive wastes. The key factor, however, is the deve lopment of technology to economically extract the rare earths from the existing process streams. Mining and processing of the Brockman Aust ralia deposit would lead to co-production of high purity alumina, zirconia, yttria/rare earth concentrate, niobium, and tantalum pent- oxide. Although xenotime mineral has not been found, the distributio n of yttrium and the rare earth oxides in the deposit is similar to the distribution found in xenotime. The minerals in this deposit are very fine grained, and it is not possible to prod uce a physical concentrate of any of the valuable minerals. All the minera ls have to be first obtained in solution and then processed for separation. The feasibility of obtaining the ore in the solution has been demonstrated in a pilot plant. A mining rate of 300,000 metric tons per year has been con- sidered for the deposit. At this rate, the prod uction of REO concentrate would be 450 metric tons per year which includes 275 metric tons per year of yttrium oxide. The resource is sufficient to support this level of production for over 100 years. The Brockman deposit is a large potential source of yttrium and the other rare earth oxides. Current development of the sour ce is hindered by remote location and high processing costs. Other candidates for development are the Mo unt Weld rare earth deposit in Western Australia, with a grade of 26% REO and yttriu m, the deposit at Yangibana with a grade of 1.7%, the allanite deposit at Alice Springs at 0.8% REO, and the placer deposit at Cataby, which has a potential for 4000 metric tons pe r year of monazite (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). Figure 2.6 Potential (P) and actual (A) rare ear th production of important rare earth producing countries. 02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm Wednesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 127 In addition there are a few dedicated resour ces in Australia which could be developed. These include tailings from the processing of Radium Hill uranium ore at Port Pirie, South Australia, tailings from old uranium extractio n operations at Mary Kathleen, Queensland, and a carbonatite deposit at Cummi ns Range in Western Australia. Australia has been a major producer of th e rare earth raw materials monazite and xenotime. New mineral sands projects in Vidoria and Western Australia can support increased future production of these minerals . In addition there are a number of other potential sources of rare earths, some of them large and/or with attractively high europium and yttrium contents. 2.10 FORECAST Published forecasts for rare earth production expect a growing dema nd and a continuously rising market for rare earths. The world consum ption of rare earths was estimated at 45,000 metric tons REO in 1990, rising to 80,000 by the year 2000. Growing by 4 to 9 tons peryear (tpy) the world demand is set to exceed th e milestone of 100,000 tpy REO for the first time by 2004. With these anticipated consumpt ion rates, there should be no difficulty in ensuring the supply of rare earths. In some of the working deposits, the reserves are sufficient for many years and adjacent resources will extend their operating periods. Those projects that could recover REO, but do not, co uld easily install rare earth circuits in their existing beneficiation plants. Several world clas s rare earth deposits, especially in Australia and China, have yet to be developed as wo rld demand is currently satisfied by existing production, which itself is much less than the existing production po tential. Considering that new deposits will continue to be located, world resources should be adequate to fulfill the demand for the foreseeable future. The estimated long-term rare earth availability is presented in Figure 2.7. In relation to the cumulative world produc tion until the year 2002 (1,721, 000 metric tons REO), world rare earth reserves (93 million metric tons of contained REO) appear to be very substantial. Since this is the picture when only R1E reso urces are taken into account, the inclusion of other R1 resources and R2 reso urces will make natural availabi lity of rare earths adequate to fulfill the world demand easily through the twenty-first century. Even though in terms of total REO content the world rare earth reserves amount to an impressive figure of about 93 million metric to ns, the amount of individual rare earths theo- retically recoverable from this vast reserve varies greatly. The rare earth element distribution in bastna site and monazite qu alitatively reflect the relative abundance of rare earths in nature. This is illustrated in Fi gure 2.8. The proportion of heavier rare earths (Sm–Lu, Y) content in bastnasite is considerably less than in monazite, which itself is less than that an ticipated from crustal abundance data. Heavier rare earths are present in higher proportion in xenotime. While the minerals bastnasite and monazite are abundantly available in nature, xenotime occurrence and availability is small in comparison. Hence the rare earth composition in xenotim e does not have much impact on overall rare earth availa bility. Large differences, ther efore, are inherent in the availability of different rare earth elements . This status remains practically undisturbed even after the discovery of substantial quantit ies of ion adsorption type ores that are particularly enriched in middle and heavy rare earths because their extent as compared to bastnasite and monazite is still small. 02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm Wednesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 128 Earlier the theoretically recoverable rare earth content from world reserves was esti- mated at 47.6 million metric tons REO, assumi ng (Hedrick 1988) one half of the world rare earth reserves are in bastnasite and one-half are in monazite, and these ores could be mined and separated without any mining, milling, and refining losses. More recent estimates (Jack- son and Christiansen 1993), however, place wo rld reserves at 93 mi llion metric tons REO, with only 20% in monazite and 80% in bastnasite and certain other minerals. Assumingagain that these ores could be mined and sepa rated without any mining, milling, and refining losses, the theoretically recoverable rare earths from world rare earth reserves has been re- calculated and given in Figure 2.9. The unequal availability of individual rare earths be- comes more strongly highlighted in this estimat e because bastnasite is poorer in heavy rare earth content than monazite, an d bastnasite is the more pred ominant mineral in world rare earth resources. Latest estimates (USGS 2003) on world rare earth reserves place it at 88 million tons REO, and this would bring down the values shown in Figure 2.9 by approximately 5%. Currently there is a trend among rare earth processes to shift away from radioactivity bearing rare earth ores. This trend has led to an adverse impact on monazite-producing mineral sands operations everywhere in the world. However, the favorable aspects ofmonazite as the rare earth resource, namely higher concentration of heavy rare earths, abundant supply, and recovery as a low cost by-product, will ensure a future long-term demand for monazite. However, the cost an d space to dispose of the radioactive waste products will also rise and remain a problem to be tackled as this can result in severely limiting the use of monazite. In fact, several ot her current rare-earth raw-material resources are also constrained by environmental concerns , including the production of bastnasite in California and ion adsorption clays in Southern China. Hedrick (1997) predicted that in the fo reseeable future the top three rare earth producers, China, the U.S., and Australia, woul d remain significant rare earth suppliers and stated that the economic restructuring of East ern Europe and Asia indicated a large poten- tial for both new sources as well as new consumers. world rare earth resources (R1E) 93.4 Mt REOworld cumulative production up to 2002 1.72 Mt REO Figure 2.7 Estimated long term availability of rare earths. 02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm Wednesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 129 (a) Crustal abundanceTb LuHoErTmYb EuDy Gd SmPrY NdLa Ce Sm-Lu, YPrNdLa Ce (b) Bastnasite (c) Sm-Lu in bastnasiteTb,Dy,Ho,Er Gd EuYTm, Yb, Lu Sm (d) MonaziteYPrSm-Lu LaNdCe (e) Sm-Lu in monaziteTmYb EuHo Lu ErTb DyGd Sm (f) XenotimeEu,Tb,Tm,Lu GdHo YbErDy La-Nd Y (g) Sm-Lu in xenotimeEu LuTb Sm Tm (h) ion adsorption ore (Rare earth laterite, Longnan, China)Y Figure 2.8 Relative contents of individual rare earths in major minerals: (a) crustal abundance; (b) bastnasite; (c) Sm–Lu in bastnasite; (d) monazite; (e) Sm–Lu in monazite; (f) xenotime; (g) Sm–Lu in xenotime; (h) ion adsorption ore (rare earth laterite, Longnan, China).

The rare earths are a relatively abundant group of metallic elements in the earth’s crus t, occurring in over 200 minerals. As a rule, any rare earth mineral usually contains all the rare earths, some of them enriched and some in very low concentrations. Although the minerals are nume rous, about 95% of all world rare earth resources occur in just three mi nerals: bastansite, monazite, and xenotime. A dozen other minerals also have been or could be used as rare earth resources. Rare earth deposits contain one or more ra re earth minerals. They are broadly divided into hard rock deposits and placer sands. Bast nasite is found only in hard rock deposits, whereas monazite and xenotime occur in both hard rock and placer deposits. Deposits that have been traditionally considered as re serves correspond approximately to the “R1E resources” in the United Nations Resource Classification System. World reserves (R1E resources) of rare ear ths have been estimated at 93.4 million metric tons REO in place, of which 93% o ccur in hard rock (primary) deposits and 7% occur in placer (secondary) deposits. These re sources occur as follows: 20% in monazite and 80% in bastnasite and other minerals. Geographically, 52% of world REO resources are located in China, 22% in Namibia, 15% in the United States, 5% in Australia, 3% in India, and the remainder in several other countr ies. According to latest estimates, world rare earth reserves are 88 million tons. There are as many as 40 rare earth depos its in the United States. The most important is Mountain Pass bastnasite deposit, which has over 3 million metric tons of REO and the distinction of being the only rare earth depo sit in the world worked exclusively for the recovery of rare earths. Numero us other deposits of present a nd future relevance are in the United States. These include placer monazite deposits in the states of Florida, South Carolina, and Alaska, and deposits of other rare earth minerals such as euxenite, eudialyte, apatite, and other phosphorites, and perovskites. There are 35 rare earth deposits in Australia, 28 are placers and 7 hard rock. Heavy mineral sand placer deposits containing monazi te are widely distributed along the east and west Australian coasts. Major deposits at an d near Eneabba have been the most important. The most promising and large reserves of mo nazite and xenotime are the WIM-150 deposit Figure 2.9 Theoretically recoverable rare earth contents from world reserves. 02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm Wednesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMRESOURCES OF RARE EARTHS 131 and four other deposits in Murray Basin. Ot her major deposits include the Olympic Dam multimetal deposit, the Brockman deposit, th e Toongi deposit, and for recovery of rare earths as a main product, the deposits at Mt. Weld, Yangibana, and John Galt. Brazil has many placer deposits along the A tlantic coast and the only inland placer at Sao Goncalo de Sapucai on the Sapucai River. Mo nazite is the mineral in all these deposits. One of the two hard rock deposits occur at Tapira, an existing apatite mine where rare earths occur in anatase overburden, and the ot her hard rock bastnas ite deposit occurs at Pocos de Caldas. Many rare earth deposits, hard rock and pl acers, occur in India. The hard rock de- posits, however, have been completely over shadowed by the extensive placer deposits of monazite-containing heavy minerals in the southwestern and eastern coasts. In Canada there are large rare earth deposits that together contain more than 1 million metric tons REO. They include rare earth occu rring in uranium ores at Elliot Lake, Ontario, a gadolinite deposit at Strange Lake, Quebec and a columbite–gadolinite deposit at Thor Lake, Northwest Territories. China has numerous rare earth deposits, some of them unusual and some of them among the world’s largest. The world’s largest known rare earth deposit, containing 48 mil- lion metric tons REO, occurs at Bayan Obo. It is a iron–rare earth–niobium resource. Bast- nasite and monazite account for about 70% and 30%, respectively, in the rare earth fraction. Monazite and xenotime placers occur at Guangd ong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Hainan Provinces in south China. The unusual ion ad sorption type ore occurs at Jiangxi, Guang- dong, Fujian, Hunan, Guangxi, and southern Anhui Provinces. Bastnasite also occurs in Sichuan and Shangdong. The rare earth deposits of China are great in quantity, and taken together are relatively better balanced as regards light, middle, and heavy rare earths content. South Africa has more than 1 million metric tons of REO in its de posits, which include placer monazite at Richards Bay, rare earth bearing apatite at Phalaborwa complex, and monazite co-occurring with apatite and fluorite at Buffalo fluorspar. In the former Soviet Union large deposits of the rare earth mineral loparite and rare earth bearing phosphate rocks of magmatic origin occur in the Kola Peninsula. Heavy mineral sands containing monazite an d, most importantly, xenotime, occur in the placer cassiterite deposits in the southeas t Asia tin belt in Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. An enormous hard rock carbonatite deposit containing bastnasite occurs at Etaneno in Namibia. This deposit, containing an estimate d 20 million metric tons REO, is second in size only to the Bayan Obo deposit in China. Besides this and the deposits at South Africa, rare earth resources are found in Africa at Malawi (hard rock monazite, Kangankunde),Mozambique (placer monazite, Congolone), Bu rundi (hard rock bast nasite, Karonge and Kasagwe), Kenya (hard rock monazite, Rangwa /Ruri/Homa), Egypt (placer monazite, Nile Delta–Rosetta), Mauritania (hard rock mo nazite, Bou Naga), and Gaban (hard rock florencite, Mabounie). Rare earth deposits also occur in Argentin a (placer monazite, Rio Tercero (Colorado)), Greenland (hard rock pyrochlore and eudialyt e, Ilimaussaq), New Zealand (placer mona- zite, Barrytown and Westport in South Isla nd), Sri Lanka (placer monazite, Pulmoddai), Uruguay (placer monazite, Atlantida), Bangl adesh (placer monazite, Cox Bazzar coastal area), Germany (placer monazite, Cuxhaven), Indonesia (placer monazite, Tin Islands), Japan (hard rock sphene, Kamioka lead–zinc mine), Myanmar (placer monazite, Dawei and Myeik), Taiwan (placer monazite, Southwest coast), Turkey (hard rock bastnasite,02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm Wednesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 132 Eskisehir), Venezuela (lateritic beds, Cerro Impacto), Vietnam (hard rock bastnasite, Nam Nam Xe), and Zaire (placer monazite, Kivu region). In spite of the large identified world reso urces for rare earths, their production and supply have been affected because, except at Mountain Pass, the rare earth minerals can be produced only as a by-product or co -product of some other mineral value. Monazite was the principal rare earth so urce from the beginning of the rare earth industry 100 years ago until 1965. Thereafter production of bastnasite exceeded monazite production. In the 1990s, the status of monazi te as a rare earth resource diminished and the production of bastansite and to a certain ex tent that of other resources such as ion adsorption ores have been increasing. India and Brazil were the principal sources of world rare earth supply until the late 1940s, when Australia and Malaysia also st arted regular production. Much of the world rare earth supply during 1950 to 1985 came principally from the United States and secondly from Australia. By 1985 China rose to seco nd place and by 1988 it overtook the United States to become the world’s leading producer. Rare earth production in both China and the United States is primarily from bastnasite. In 2002, world rare earth production was 98,300 metric tons REO. The leading pro- ducer was China (88,000 metric tons REO), foll owed by the United States (5000 metric tons REO), India (2700 t REO), and former USSR (2000 t REO). In 2003, while the world mine production reached 95,000 metric tons RE O, no production was reported from U.S. Mountain Pass deposit (Hedrick 2004). China pr oduced 90,000 metric tons REO, with India and Commonwealth of Independent States co ntributing 2700 and 20 00 tons, respectively. In 1995, monazite started losing its importan ce due to problems associated with thorium disposal (probably only temporarily). Wh ile the total world REO production remained practically at the same level, the contribu tions from two major countries — Australia and Malaysia — declined substantially. This has been made up by enhanced Chinese production. Actual world rare earth production is much less than the world production potential. If the presently operating mines had all produced REO instead of discarding or stockpiling it, the total world production could be more than double the actual world production. The status as regards individual countries is vast ly variable. Further enhancement in rare earth production is possible by expl oiting new reserves. Worldwid e there are many new projects that could begin rare earth production within a few years. Forecasts for rare earth production expect a growing demand and a continuously rising market for rare earths. The world rare earth consumption in the year 2000 was 80,000 metric tons REO and is set to exceed 100, 000 t REO by the year 2004. There could be no difficulty in ensuring the supply of rare earth s to meet such demand. Besides, undiscovered resources are thought to be very large relati ve to expected demand (Hedrick 2004). In relation to the world cumulative production in the year 2003 (1,816,000 metric tons REO), world rare earth reserves (93,000,000 metric tons REO) were very substantial. While the total REO content is an impressive figure of 93 million metric tons, the amount of indivi- dual rare earths theoretically recoverable from this vast reserve varies greatly because only 20% of the total reserves are in monazite an d almost 80% are in bastnasite, with minor quantities in other rare earth minerals. Bastnasi te is poorer in heavy rare earth content when compared to monazite. The individual rare earth availability is strongly tilted toward the light rare earths. 02 Chapter 2 57-1 32.fm Wednesday, November 10, 2004 8:41 AMCHAPTER 3 Resource Processing 3.1 INTRODUCTION In the extractive flowsheet of a metal, the term “resource processing” usually refers to the group of unit operations, invol ving both physical and chemical processing, which convert the as-mined ore to a compound th at is either an end product by itself or an inter-process intermediate for the subsequent production of the metal or alloy or another compound. The processes, in the majority of the cases, are directed to the remova l of impurity compounds from the material being processed. In the case of rare earths, the resource processing involves not only the operations that result in such impurity removal, but also special operations that achieve the difficult task of separating the considerable number of naturally co-occurring rare earth elements from one another. Rare earth minerals are numerous and even those minerals shortlisted as sources for extraction are more than a dozen in number. Ho wever, much of the actual extraction of rare earths is principally from the two minerals mo nazite and bastnasite. As described in the preceding chapter, all the rare earths generally occur together in all the minerals with large variations in relative proportions. Such o ccurrence is the culmination of their similar chemical behavior, and it is this chemical simi larity that has in the past made separation of rare earths from one another a daunting task. The nature of the occurrence and distribution of the rare earth minerals has generally ensured that they could be recovered only as by-products or co-products. Therefore, except in one important case, Mountain Pass bastnasite , the physical beneficiation of the rare earth mineral is the same as that used for the ma in product of the resource. The Mountain Pass bastnasite has a unique process for physical beneficiation. Chemical beneficiation or chemical processing of the concentrate obtained after physical beneficiation usually involves hydr ometallurgical and sometimes pyrometallur- gical operations. That the rare earth minerals will undergo chemical beneficiation by hydro- metallurgy techniques is guided by the need for applying hydrometallurgical separation processes for isolating rare earths from one anot her. The chemical properties of rare earths permit their ready dissolution and easy precipita tion. Subtle and systematic differences in the basicity of the rare earth elements have b een used in developing possibilities for their chemical separation. The sheer number of rare earth elements that occur together ensured that the separation procedures, if feasible, would be laborious. However, the exhibition of 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 134 stable multivalence in the most abundant and al so in one of the least abundant rare earths simplified to some extent the separation pr ocedures. With the development of techniques like ion exchange and solvent extraction it b ecame possible to work upon the inherent dif- ferences in rare earths chemical behavior, however small they are, to effect their separation from one another. This chapter deals with the various aspects of rare earth resource processing. First, a brief description of the mining methods is pres ented. Then the procedures used for physical beneficiation to obtain the rare earth mineral concentrate and the procedures used to chemi- cally treat the concentrates to a mixed rare earth oxide product are given. Next, the key feature of rare earth extractive metallurgy, se paration of the rare earths from one another, is covered. All important processes and those th at have been rated as suitable for industrial operation are covered. Essentially, resources processing comprises breaking down the min- eral, recovering the rare earth values, and sepa rating the individual rare earths. These oper- ations are preceded by mining and benefici ation to obtain the concentrate for processing. 3.2 MINING 3.2.1 Hard Rock Deposits Hard rock rare earth deposits are mined by open pit and underground methods (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). At two of the world’s larg est rare earth mines, Bayan Obo in China and Mountain Pass in the United States, the open pit operations are the standard drill, blast, load, Figure 3.1 Physical beneficiation of beach sand minerals. 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 135 and haul to the mill procedures. At the Canadi an uranium properties where rare earths could be recovered as by-product, underground room and pillar mining have been conducted. 3.2.2 Placer Deposits Mining of placer sands that are under water or affected by a high wa ter table is conducted by dredges. Shallower sands are mined using bucket wheel units, while bucket line and suction dredges are used for deeper material. Where water is not available, variations of open pit excavation methods, such as scrapers , front-end loaders, shovels, and draglines, are used. Usually drilling and blasting are not required but are useful when the sand is cemented by ferruginous or calcarenous preci pitates. In countries where inexpensive, manual labor is available, the labor has been used to fill head-carried baskets or to work hand-operated sluices. The as-mined ore is subjected to a physical beneficiation process after crushing and milling in the case of hard rock ore, and in the as-mined condition in the case of placer sand. 3.3 PHYSICAL BENEFICIATION 3.3.1 MonaziteIn placer deposits, monazite occurs as a mino r constituent along with sillimanite, garnet, and magnetite, while the major minerals are ilme nite, rutile, zircon, and quartz. Cassiterite occurs as the major mineral in the placer depo sits of the Southeast Asia tin belt. Occasion- ally, trace quantities of other minerals, such as chromite, picotite, baddeleyite, and cinnabar, and native metals such as gold and platinum are also present. The beach sand deposits exhibit a considerable variation in mineralo gy and chemical composition depending on the location (Hedrick 1985). The fl owsheets for their beneficiation are therefore variable in detail. However, as the task is essentially to separate the already finely divided minerals with quite similar physical properties, the fl owsheets have several features in common. An outline of the major steps in processing by physical beneficiation is given in Figure 3.1. The highest concentrations of heavy minera ls (HMs) in beach sand are found in the Manavalakurichi (70–80% HMs and 4–7% monazite) and Chavara deposits (70–80% HMs and 0.7–1% monazite) of India. Preconcen tration by wet gravity methods is generally not required for these deposits. The same is true of the Pulmoddai deposit (Panditharatna 1991), which has 60–75% HMs, 70–80% ilmenite, 8–10% rutile, 8–10% zircon, and 0.02% monazite. With the Orissa deposit of India (20% HMs and 0.4% monazite), and for most other deposits throughout the world, bu lk concentration of HMs is needed before actual separation of individual minerals is carried out (Bashir 1988). For example, a lean deposit containing 2–5% HMs is first concentr ated to 20–30% HMs on cone concentrators. This product is then fed into spirals, whic h give a concentrate of more than 80% HMs. The separation of heavy minerals is then achieved by exploiting small gravimetric differences or the slight differences in ma gnetizability and surface ionization potential among the various co-occurring minerals (Aplan 1988, Bashir 1988, Anderson 1986, Parker and Baroch 1971). Among the beach sand mine rals, specific gravity of monazite is the03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 136 highest. Ilmenite, garnet, xenotime, and mon azite, in decreasing orde r of magnetizability, behave as magnetic minerals. In electrostatic separation, ilmenite and rutile behave as con- ducting minerals and at other times behave as nonconducting. Xenotime is more strongly magnetic than monazite and in magnetic separation concentrates with ilmenite. A poor elec- trical conductor, xenotime is electrostatically separated from ilmenite. Leucoxene, whenpresent, can cause problems in the separation of monazite from ilmenite. A reduction roast at 600°C converts free hematite in leucoxen e into magnetite and enables easy separation. One of the simplest flowsheets for the pr oduction of a monazite concentrate from a placer deposit is shown in Figure 3.2. This fi gure outlines the process used to recover gold and monazite from a placer deposit in Idaho (Hill 1951, Jackson and Christiansen 1993). Gravity is the only method needed to produce a REO concentrate. Gold was removedearlier by amalgamation. The dredging operations formerly operated in the gold placers in Idaho and tin placers of Southeast Asia are similar. Before separati on of the heavy minerals concentrate, just as the gold was removed by amalgamation in Ida ho, cassiterite was recovered using a series of jigs in placer tin beneficiation, Figure 3.3 (Fujita and Leepawpanth 1991, Meechumna 1991). Further separation of heavy mineral dredge concentrate is achieved using a combi- nation of high intensity magnetic separation, high tension separation, and dry and wet tabling to obtain the clean concentrate of REO minerals and other minerals (Sulaiman 1991). As mentioned earlier, the beach sands of Manavalakurichi in India and Pulmoddai need not be preconcentrated. It is directly put in for separation into its constituents using electrostatic and magnetic methods. Some of the mineral beneficiation practices for obtaining monazite concentrate are outlined in Figures 3.4 to 3.7. A combination of physical and flotation me thods have been used for recovery of monazite concentrate from fine heavy mi neral beach sand deposits (Ferron et al . 1991). When the valuable constituents of heavy minera l deposits are in a finer size range (between 15 and 100 microns), standard gravity methods are not very efficient and heavy losses of the valuable finer size constituents were observed. Flotation as useful.

Figure 3.6 Beneficiation flowsheet at Zircon Ru tile Ltd., Australia (Ferron et al . 1991). 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 139 In the former Soviet Union, for the produc tion of bulk heavy mineral concentrate from fine grained beach sand deposits, flotation us ing fatty acid collectors was used (Zadorozh- nyi 1965, 1967). Ferron et al . (1991) found that bulk mineral flotation can be performed efficiently using fatty acids or phosphoric aci d esters as collectors. When separation of individual heavy minerals by flot ation is involved, collector se lection is dependent upon the ease of desorption prior to separation. The dressing of South African monazite depo sits occurring in as sociation with copper minerals (Hill 1951) was done by flotation to recover both monazite and copper concen- trates. Beneficiation by flotation had also been developed for Indian monazite (Viswa- nathan 1957) and for the recovery of monaz ite from molybdenum flotation tailings at the Climax Co. mine of Amax (Aplan 1988, Cuth bertson 1952). The flowsheet of the Climax Molybdenum Company’s Byproducts Plan t, CO is shown in Figure 3.8. 3.3.2 Bastnasite The bastnasite ore of Mountain Pass has a dist inctive beneficiation process. The process, in a simplified form, is shown in Figure 3.9. Th e blasted bastnasite rock is crushed and the crushed ore is built in layers to average 7% RE O in blending piles, to be reclaimed and fed to the mill fine ore bin. The ore is withdrawn from the bin and conveyed to a ball mill where the particle size is reduced to 100% passing 150 mesh. The ground ore is beneficiated by hot froth flotation. The flotation characteristics of bastnasite ar e fairly well established (Aplan 1988, Fuer- stenau and Pradip 1986). Various collectors su ch as fatty acids (oleic) (Morrice and Wong Figure 3.7 Flowsheet of the beneficiation of beach sand minerals in India. 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 140 1982), hydroxamates (Aplan 1988, Pradip and Fuerstenau 1988), and dicarboxylic acids (Xuefang 1985) have been proposed and/or us ed. Some of the gangue minerals associated with bastnasite, such as calcite, barite, and celes ite, have flotation properties similar to bast- nasite and their separation by conven tional fatty acid flotation is difficult. Mountain Pass ore contains the gangue mi nerals barite, calcite, strontianite, and quartz. Prior to rougher flotation, the ore un dergoes as many as six different conditioning treatments. Conditioning is carried out in large tanks (1800 mm by 2700 mm) with steam being bubbled through the pulp. The reagents ar e added step-wise in the pulp heated to 70 to 90°C, and the six-stage conditioning lasts for about 2 h. In the first stage, the ore slurry is mixed with soda ash, sodium fluosilicate, and steam. The next step is steam conditioning. In the third stage, ammonium lignin sulfonate is added in the presence of steam. In the fourth stage, the pulp is conditioned with st eam, in the fifth stage with steam-distilled tall oil C-30, and in the sixth stage again with steam. The conditioned slurry, which contains 30–35% solids, is pumped to a rougher flotatio n circuit. Rougher flot ation is carried out in 12 flotation cells, each with a capacity of 1 700 liters. The tailings from rougher flotation average 1–2% REO. The rougher concentrate, which assays approximately 30% REO, is transported to cleaner cells for four-stage cleaning. These cells operate at 50% solids. Within the cleaning circuit the tailings are re circulated. Only the tailings from the first cleaner are put through a scavenger flotation ci rcuit. The tailings fro m the scavenger circuit are combined with rougher tailings and constitu te the flotation plant tailings which average 2% REO. The concentrate from the scavenger is reground and reverted to the rougher cells. Figure 3.8 Flowsheet of Climax Molybdenum Company’s Byproducts Plant, CO (Aplan 1988).03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 141 After four-stage cleaning, the final concentr ate from the flotation circuit is thickened, filtered, and dried. The final dried concentr ate of Mountain Pass contains 60% REO and the overall recovery is 65–70% (Pradip and Fuerstenau 1988). A higher recovery of 88% was obtained in a scheme (Ferron et al . 1991) shown in Figure 3.10. The complex bastnasite ore was beneficiated using a double reverse gangue flotation followed by bastnasite flotation. A specially developed collector was used. 3.3.3 Bayan Obo Ore Numerous minerals occur intimately intergrown in the rare earth-bearing Bayan Obo iron ore (Aplan 1988, Fangji et al . 1988). In physical beneficiation, in addition to the rare earths, magnetite, fluorite, hematite, and niobium ox ide are recovered as valuable by-products. Figure 3.9 Simplified flowsheet for the recovery of bastnasite at the Molycorp plant (Aplan 1988). Figure 3.10 New scheme for the treatment of complex bastnasite ore (Ferrron et al . 1991). 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 142 Three schemes for the processing flowshee t of Bayan Obo ore (Luo and Clin 1988, 1985, Houot et al . 1991) are shown in Figure 3.11. Th e initial bulk flotation is carried out after grinding the ore to 90% <74 µm, with Na2CO3 as pH regulator, Na2SiO3 as depressant of iron minerals and silicates, and sodium salt of oxidized petroleum (paraffin soap) as col- lector. Depressed iron minerals and silicates remain at the bo ttom of the flotation cells and are taken for iron beneficiation and niobium recovery. After eliminating the surplus fatty acid collector by thickening and desliming at 5 µm, selective rare earth flotation is carried out with Na2CO3 as pH regulator, Na2SiO3 and Na2SiF6 as gangue depressants, and hydro- xamic acid as collector at a pH between 5 and 6. Depressed calcite, fluorite, and barite settle to the flotation cell bottom. After selective flot ation, the rougher concentrate contains appro- ximately 45% REO. It contains both monazite and bastnasite. The recovery of rare earth as the concentrate at this stage is ~80%. After th e final treatment by cleaning or high intensity magnetic separation, two concentrate fractio ns — the primary 68% REO concentrate and a secondary monazite concentrate containing 36% REO concentrate — are obtained at re- coveries of 25% and 36%, respectively. The tota l recovery of rare earths from the ore is 61%. 3.4 CHEMICAL TREATMENT 3.4.1 Monazite The recovery of mixed rare earths and remo val of thorium from monazite are accomplished by a variety of methods (Bril 1964), after ch emically attacking the mineral with sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide. Figure 3.11 Schemes for the physical beneficiat ion of Bayan Obo ore (Anderson 1986, Houot et al . 1991).03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 143 Acid treatment The sulfuric acid method had been used most extensively in the United States (Parker and Baroch 1971). With this method (Shaw et al . 1954), depending on the acid/ore ratio, temperature and concentration, either thorium or the rare earths can be selectively solubilized or both thorium and ra re earths totally solubilized. Rare earths and thorium are subsequently recovered from the solution. The processes available are shown in Figure 3.12. The process of rare earth reco very based on rare earth double sulfate precipi- tation was largely developed by Pilkington an d Wylie (1952) and has found industrial ap- plication. Yttrium and the heavy rare earth do uble sulfates are quite soluble and go with thorium. Even in the stepwise neutralization procedure investigated at Ames (Smutz et al . 1954, Barghusen and Smutz 1958 ), yttrium and the heavy rare earths are precipitated along with thorium as a basic compound. The rare earths, however, are recoverable from the thorium fraction during solvent extraction fo r the purification of thorium and uranium. Solvent extraction with tributyl phosphate (T BP) from an aqueous 8 N nitric acid solution of thorium and mixed rare earths permits the recovery of thorium, uranium, cerium, and cerium-free rare earths. Other commercially sign ificant processes essentially involve preci- pitation of thorium pyrophosphate or basic salts from the leach liquor and subsequent re- covery of the rare earth in solution as do uble sulfates, fluorides, or hydroxides or even selective solubilization of thorium in the ore tr eatment stage itself, as originally developed by Société des Produits Chimiques des Terres Rares (Powell 1939). The sulfuric acid pro- cess does not yield pure products and is no longer in commercial use. Alkali treatment The flowsheet for the present commercial process for monazite treatment using caustic soda is given in Figu re 3.13. The phosphate content of the ore is recovered as a marketable by-product, trisod ium phosphate, at the beginning of the flow- sheet, and this has been a major attraction fo r the commercial use of this process. The practical development of caustic soda treatme nt for rare earth processing is credited to Figure 3.12 Monazite processing by acid treatment. 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 144 de Rhoden and Peltier (1957), and considerable work on the process was carried out at the Battelle Memorial Institute. In the usual industri al practice, fine ground monazite is attacked with a 60–70% sodium hydroxi de solution at 140–150°C (Krumholz 1957). In the Soviet practice, the grinding and caustic digestion ar e performed in one step and this enables about 50% savings in caustic soda consumption. Krum holz (1957) achieved a clean separation by digesting the ore with caustic soda at 170°C under a pressure of several atmospheres. The mixed rare earth thorium hydroxide cake is processed for rare earths and thorium recovery by a variety of methods. The direct dissolution of mixed rare earth hydroxide in nitric acid and the separation of rare earths by extracting thorium and uranium with TBP is attractive but complicatedbecause of interference arising from partial ox idation of cerium. An effective process for removing thorium completely and in a high stat e of purity is solven t extraction with higher amines. The amines function well with a sulfate solution (Kaczmarek 1981). IRE practice The Indian Rare Earths Ltd. plant at Alwaye in Kerala uses the caustic soda treatment for the decompos ition of monazite sands, an d the process has four major stages: (1) Reaction of finely ground monazite sand with hot concentrated aqueous caustic soda solution, to convert the rare earth and t horium contained in the ore into their respective hydroxides. (2) Separation of the insolubl e hydroxides from the dissolved phosphate and excess caustic soda. (3) Recovery of trisodium phosphate, and (4) Separation of rare earthsfrom thorium by leaching with hydrochloric aci d. An outline of the flowsheet at the IRE plant is shown in Figure 3.14. The monazite sand is ground in a ball m ill to finer than 300 mesh size in a closed circuit system using an air classifier. The gr ound sand in 1/2 ton batc hes is mixed with 50% caustic solution and the resulting mass is fe d to a conical mild steel tank and heated to Figure 3.13 Monazite processing by alkali treatment. 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 145 approximately 150°C with the addition of fresh caustic soda at a ratio of about 1:1. The final concentration of caustic soda to give a mo nazite sand caustic soda is about 65 to 70%. The mixture is agitated during the reaction, which lasts for about 3 to 4 h. Most of the monazite is decomposed during this period. The hydroxides–trisodium phosphate mixture is dumped into a tank containing dilute wash liquors from a previous decantation, and the slurry is heated to approximately 90°C and the density adjusted to about 30°Be. The sl urry is allowed to settle for about 12 h when the supernatant liquid containing most of the trisodium phosphate and excess caustic soda is drawn off and sent to the trisodium phos phate recovery section. The hydroxides are washed once again with hot water and allowe d to decant, and the supernatant liquid is drawn off to be reused for a subseque nt extraction of trisodium phosphate. By this means, the free alkalinity in the hy droxides is reduced from about 70 gms per liter (expressed as free NaOH) to about 15 gms per liter. The mixture of hydroxides is then fed to a vacuum leaf filter and washed to redu ce the alkalinity before being treated for the separation of rare earths from thorium. The solution of trisodium phosphate and caustic soda from the decantation tanks is filtered and fed to a vacuum for crystallization. In the crystallizer, the solution is cooled in two stages from about 70°C to 20°C, at which temperature most of the trisodium phosphate crystallizes out. The mixture of trisodium phosphate crystals and dilute caustic soda solution is fed to a continuous centrifuge and the centrifuged trisodium phosphate is dried in a hot air conveyor drier. The dry trisod ium phosphate contains approximately 19% P2O5, and is purer than the trisodium phosphate ma nufactured by the usual process of neutraliza- tion of phosphoric acid. The washed hydroxide cake is treated in a rubber lined tank with 21 to 22°Be hydro- chloric acid. Sufficient quantity of hydrochlor ic acid is added to dissolve only the rare Figure 3.14 IRE process for caustic soda treatment of monazite. 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 146 earths while the thorium remains undissolved. Iron is precipitated by oxidizing it to the ferric stage, and suitable precautions are take n to prevent oxidation of cerium to the ceric stage. The pH of this slurry is in the neighbor hood of 3. The slurry is pumped to a plate and frame type filter press using rubber lined equipment. The filtrate after removal of lead is conv erted to the fused mixed rare earth chloride by heating it in an enameled cast iron vesse l to the boiling point of approximately 145°C and then pouring it into steel dr ums where it solidifies on cooling. The thorium hydroxide is washed and the wa sh waters are converted either to the mixed rare earth carbonate by the addition of sodium carbonate or to the mixed rare earth hydroxide by the addition of caustic soda. Both of these rare earth compounds are dried in a rotary drier before packed in steel drums. The cake contains all the thorium present in the monazite and most of the uranium. It also contains a certain percentage of rare earths and other insoluble impurities. The crude thorium hydroxide cake is dissolve d in an excess of hydrochloric acid, and the resulting chloride solution is filtered on a plate and frame type filter press to remove insoluble impurities like ilmenite , zircon, etc. The clear filtrat e is treated with an excess of 50% sulfuric acid. Most of the thorium is preci pitated as a sulfate, while most of the rare earths and most of the uranium remain in solu tion. The thorium sulfate is centrifuged in a rubber lined centrifuge and the solution is sent for recovery of thorium, rare earths, and uranium that are in solution. The sulfate is no t pure enough and is further purified by re- precipitating with 50% sulfuric acid to give a purer thorium sulfate. The pure thorium sulfate is converted to hydroxide by reacting it with ammonium hydroxide. This is filtered and washed on filter presses to remove all the water soluble impurities. The thorium hydroxide is then diss olved in chemically pure nitric acid to give a solution of thorium nitrate, which is filtered and evaporated to the required strength in a glass lined evaporator. The molten nitrate is al lowed to solidify in aluminum dishes and then packed in glass bottles or steel lined drums. The solution obtained from the precipitati on of thorium sulfate is treated for the recovery of thorium, rare earths, and uraniu m by fractional precipitation with hydrofluoric acid. Monazite breakdown practices The conditions for monazite processing by alkali treatment have remained essentially unchange d for the past 40 years, except for minor variations. Recent summaries (Mackey 1986, Ha rt and Levins 1988, Koch 1987) of alkali digestion practices note that monazite can be ve ry fine ground (to less than 10 micron) and cracked with a 70% NaOH solution under pressure for 2 h at 150°C to form an insoluble hydroxide residue of rare earths and thoriu m. Subsequently, the hydroxide residue is leached in nitric, sulfuric, or hydrochloric aci d to prepare rare earth solutions for solvent extraction. Studies on the decomposition of an Australian monazite concentrate (48.6% rare earths, 6% thoria, 31% phosphate, and 14 % residue of mostly zircon) pointed out that the extraction reached 98% only by digesting fine ground (l ess than 45 micron) monazite concentrate in 80% w/v (NaOH:monazite weight ratio 1.5:1) at 140°C for 3 h. Studies on Brazilian monazite have also confirmed the neces sity of fine grinding (less than 45 micron) and high temperature (140–200°C) for effectiv e decomposition. In their investigations on chemical treatment of Taiwanese black monazite, Miao and Horng (1988) used both “hydrothermal” and soda fusion methods. In the hydrothermal process, ground monazite (95% within 80 to 100 mesh) was cracked with 45 wt % of aqueous alkali solution at 170°C and 5 atmospheres in an autocl ave for 3 h. As an alternativ e they fed unground monazite into fused caustic soda at 400°C in an open cylindrical stainless steel tank and reacted the03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 147 mass for 2.5 h with low speed agitation. In each of these operations, 90% of the rare earths contained in the monazite was recovered in the product. The product was rare earth hydroxide slurry with sodium phosphate in th e first case and rare earth hydrous oxide with sodium phosphate hard mass rock in the seco nd. In either case, the product was converted to the chloride by dissolving in HCl, and th orium was selectively precipitated as hydroxide from the RE chlorides by pH adjustment. Caustic soda digestion is the process follow ed in the monazite cracking plant estab- lished in Malaysia in 1979, by Asian Rare Earth Sdn Bhd (ARE) at Bukit Merah in Perak State (Sulaiman 1991). Caustic soda digestio n yields trisodium phosphate and the hydr- oxides of rare earths and thorium. The phosp hate is separated from the hydroxides by dis- solving it in water. From this solution it is crystallized out or converted to tricalcium phos- phate. Thorium and rare earths are separated by a selective dissolution method. Rare earths are dissolved in concentrated HCl, and the un dissolved thorium is filtered and produced as thorium cake waste. The rare earth fraction is separated into light and heavy rare earths by solvent extraction with HDEHP and the rare ear ths are finally precipitated as carbonates. Rhône-Poulenc uses caustic soda digestion for chemical treatment of monazite at its plants in La Rochelle (France) and Freeport (Texas, U.S.). Monazite concentrate is reacted with sodium hydroxide to break the phosphate matrix. The rare earth hydroxides recovered in the process are leached with nitric acid to produce nitrate solutions for solvent extraction. Rhône-Poulenc separates all the ra re earths by solvent extraction. High temperature process A process involving high temperature reaction of monazite with calcium chloride and calcium carbonate has been suggested by Merritt (1990). In this process monazite is decomposed by reacting it with calcium chloride and calcium carbo- nate in an environment that is both reducing and sulfidizing, at temperatures between 980 and 1190°C. The products formed are rare earth oxysulfides, oxychlorides, a thorium rich oxide solid solution, and a calcium chlorophos phate (chloropatite). From the product, the rare earth elements are removed by leaching with 3% HCl. Filtra tion is used to separate the leach liquor from the gangue minerals that re main as the residue. The thorium rich oxide residue is resistant to acid attack and is probab ly suitable for disposal by burial. The process apparently has the following attractions. (1) Effectively all the monazite is decompos ed in 45 min compared to 3–4 h for the caustic digestion process. (2) Grinding of monazite to ~50 µm is not necessary. (3) The thorium oxide residue from the dilu te acid leach is readily filtered, and, because it is more resistant to acid att ack than thorium hydroxide, the residue is more suited for disposal by burial. The high temperature reaction process, howe ver, has certain limitations. They are (i) the maximum overall recovery of rare earth el ements is only 89% compared to 94.5% for the sodium hydroxide digestion process, (i i) the recovery of phosphate value is not addressed, and (iii) the method does not offer improved rare earth element–thorium separation. Another process (Merritt 1990a) used sodium carbonate as the reactant for attacking monazite but conducted the process in an envi ronment that is both reducing and sulfidizing at 900°C. The product obtained consisted of rare earth element oxysulfide, a thorium rich oxide, and γ-trisodium phosphate and a mixed sodium rare earth element phosphate. From the reacted monazite, most of the phosphate can be separated by leaching it with water at room temperature. From the water-leached resi due, the rare earth elements can be extracted03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 148 by selectively leaching the oxysulfide phase wi th 3.5% hydrochloric acid. In the present process, decomposition of monazite is rapi d (complete in only 2 h), grinding is not necessary and the separation of rare earth s from thorium is simp le because unlike the present commercial process, careful control of pH is not necessary for separation. The better recovery of rare earth elements, 94.5 % in the sodium hydroxide digestion process, apparently makes it superior, but in that pr ocess 10% of the original thorium remains with the rare earth elements. In the sodium ca rbonate process the corresponding figures are 91.5% recovery and only 6.6% of the orig inal thorium left with the rare earths. Merritt (1990, 1990a) conduc ted the experiments for thes e investigations using very small changes in a tube furnace. It is probably too early to compare this process extensively with a process of multiton batch size. Another disadvantage of the present high temperature process is the high temperature itself. Chlorination A method of preparing anhydrou s rare earth chlorides by high temperature chlorination of monazite was in vestigated (Hartley 1952). Pelletized mixtures of monazite and charcoal were heated in chlo rine at over 900°C in a silica reactor. At this temperature over 85% of the rare earths in mo nazite were recovered as anhydrous rare earth chlorides, virtually free from thorium chlo ride and phosphorus compounds. In a later investigation by Brugger and Greinacher (1967) on the chlorination of bastnasite, it was emphasized that the process was appli cable to monazite chlorination also. 3.4.2 Bastnasite Chemical treatment of bastnasite can start with either crude ore or bastnasite concentrate. The methods available are summarized in Fi gure 3.15. The 60% REO bastnasite obtained Figure 3.15 Chemical processing of bastnasite. 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 149 as the end product of physical beneficiation can be upgraded to about 70% REO by leaching with hydrochloric acid to remove calci um and strontium carbonates. The 70% REO concentrate can be upgraded to 85–90% REO by calcining it to remove the carbon dioxide. The decomposition of bastnasite has been ex tensively investigated at Ames and at the U.S. Bureau of Mines (Rice 1 959, Shaw 1959, Berber et al. 1960). A process was described, involving nitric acid digestion and solvent extr action in which over 98% of the original rare earth content was recovered starting from the crude bastnasite ore containing 7–10% REO. Starting with bastnasite concentrate, Shaw (1 959), Berber et al. (1960) have described a process in which the concentrate was dissolved in warm concentrated sulfuric acid and the rare earths were recovered as water soluble sulfates. The sulfuric acid process has found commercial application (Kaczmarek 1981) for purifying rare earths from common elements such as Fe, Pb, Si, and Ba occurring in the ore. In the Molycorp process (World Mining 196 6) the flotation concentrate, containing 60% REO, is roasted in air at 620°C to dr ive off carbon dioxide an d oxidize cerium to a tetravalent state. The calcine is treated with 30% HCl to dissolve the noncerium rare earths, yielding a marketable cerium concentrate containing 65–70% REO with 55–60% CeO2. The solution is processed further for the recovery of europium and also to obtain other rare earths contained in it. The ceria residue also contains mixed rare earth fluorides. The process of extraction of rare earths from bastnasite by leaching wi th hydrochloric acid is also patented. In this process, the fluorides in the ore are not re moved completely. The fluorides are, however, decomposed by treatment in the caustic soda (Parker and Baroch 1971). The rare earth hydroxides are then leached with HCl. The bastnasite concentrates are processed in China by heating with 98% sulfuric acid at 500°C in a rotary kiln. By this, the fluoro carbonate matrix is destroyed, carbon dioxide and hydrofluoric acid gases are released, and the rare earths are converted to their sulfates. The rare earths are precipitated as a double sodium sulfate by leaching with water and adding sodium chloride. Subsequently, the rare earth sulfates are converted to hydroxides by digestion in a strong caust ic solution and the hydroxides are then dissolved in hydro- chloric acid. Separation and purification of the rare earths is done using solvent extraction (Hart and Levins 1988, Koch 1987). In the process followed at the Thorium Ltd. plant in the U.K., the bastnasite concentrate was treated with caustic soda to convert the fluoride component to hydroxide. Following this with dissolution in hydrochlor ic acid, a rare earth chloride solution was obtained from which the hexahydrate RECl3·6H2O was crystallized or the solution was processed further for recovering individual rare earths. Direct alkaline roasting of th e ore to convert the fluoride in the ore into soluble alkali fluoride, then water leaching, followed by sepa ration of unconverted barite by flotation was a process investigated by Kasey (1959). Kruesi and Duker (1965) of Molycorp deve loped the process, shown in Figure 3.16, for the production of rare earth chloride fro m bastnasite. The process essentially consists of three steps in which the following reactions are conducted. REF3–RE2(CO3)3 + 9HCl → REF3 + 2RECl3 + 3HCl + 3H2O + 3CO2 REF3 + 3NaOH → RE(OH)3 + 3NaF and RE(OH)3 + 3HCl → RECl3 + 3H2O03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 150 The bastnasite concentrate (70% REO, 65% minus 325 mesh) was attacked with minimum amount of hydrochloric acid (1.8 kg of 20° Be acid/kg of ore or 2.5 kg/kg of RE2O3) for 4 h at 200°F. Solid–liquid separation of the leach liquor was done by decantation. In the next step, rare earth fluoride in the solid re sidue was metathetically converted to rare earth hydroxide using 500 kg of NaOH per 1000 kg of concentrate feed (or 0.73 kg of NaOH per kg of REO feed). Reaction duration was 4 h. The metathesis cake was thoroughly washed with water to a low sodium content. The next step consisted of neutralization an d purification. Substantial amounts of free hydrochloric acid contained in the mother liqu or were neutralized by addition of the rare earth hydroxide obtained in the metathesis step, until a pH of about 3 was obtained. The pHcontrol was necessary to remove impurities. Sm all amounts of hydroxide were added to the heated solution to completely precipitate ir on hydroxide. A small amount of sulfuric acid was added to precipitate lead sulfate, and th en barium chloride was added to precipitate excess sulfate and to act as a carrier in th e removal of any thorium daughter product originally present in the ore. At this pH, th orium hydroxide is also insoluble and traces of it were removed. On filtration, a sparklin g clear solution of rare earth chlorides was obtained with all the impuritie s remaining in the cake. The cake was washed repeatedly to a low rare earth content and discarded. The ra re earth chlorides solution was concentrated by evaporation into either a solution or cast in solid form. The analyses of the bastnasite concentrate starting material and rare earth chloride end products are given in Table 3.1. 3.4.3 Chlorination Goldschmidt process A high temperature direct chlorination process was developed and used by the Goldschmidt AG in Germany (B rugger and Greinacher 1967) to directly obtain an anhydrous rare earth trichloride pr oduct well suited for the production of the Figure 3.16 Production of rare earth chlorides from bastnasite (Kruesi and Duker 1965). 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 151 corresponding metal directly from bastnasite ore. The process is suitable for use in a variety of ores like monazite, xenotime, allanite, cer ite, euxenite, ferguson ite, and gadolinite. The flowsheet of a complete rare earth chlorination process given by Brugger and Greinacher (1967) is shown in Figure 3.17. The bastnasite ore was ground to less th an 80 mesh. Regrinding, obviously, was not necessary if the flotation concentrate was us ed. The ground ore was thoroughly mixed with a binder like sulfite liquor, sugar, starch, et c., and some water. The relatively dry brew was compacted into pellets through a briquetting machine and the pellets were passed through Table 3.1 Typical analyses (%) of bastnasite concentrate and rare earth chlorides obtained aTypical analyses of Mountain Pass bastnasite concentrate. bChloride I was obtained by the wet method (Kruesi and Duker 1965). cChloride II was obtained by the dry method (Brugger and Greinacher, 1967).ConcentrateaChloride IbChloride IIc BaSO4 1.0–0.5 BaCl2 2.6–4.2 CaO 1.0–0.5 CaO 1.00 CaCl2 3.4–3.6 F 5.0–5.5 MgO 1.00 acid insoluble fluoride 13–15 Fe2O3 0.5–0.3 Fe 0.005 Fe2O3 <0.01 SiO2 1.0–0.5 SiO2 0.05 SrCl2 0.4–0.6 ThO2 <0.01 radioactivity absent MgCl2 0.1–0.2 REO 68–72 REO 46.0 REO 66.0CeO 2 50.0 CeO2 49–50 La2O3 31.0 La2O3 (including rare earths not listed)32–35 Pr6O11 5.0 Pr6O11 3.8–4.3 Nd2O3 12.9 Nd2O3 11–12 Sm2O3 0.62 Sm2O3 0.6–1 Eu2O3 0.11 Gd2O3 0.2 Y2O3 0.05 Other heavies0.02 Figure 3.17 Goldschmidt process for bastnasite chlorination (Brugger and Greinacher 1967). 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 152 a band drier. Fine fraction was screened off and reverted to the mixer because it would be blown out of the furnace due to high gas veloc ity. The pellet passed continuously or batch- wise into the chlorination furnace. The chlorination furnace is shown in Figure 3.18. The key requirement for complete chlorination is a temperature in the reacti on zone of the furnace in the range of 1000 to 1200°C. Practically all metals and refractor y materials react with chlorine and carbon and/or carbon monoxide. Natural graphite and amorphous carbon are resistant to the attack but not for a long time. Hence special furnace inserts of amorphous carbon, which could be rapidly replaced, were developed and used. In the furnace, the ore–carbon mixture wa s completely converted to chlorides by gaseous chlorine. The chlorides were separate d according to their volatility. The rare earth chlorides were tapped from the bottom of the furnace periodically as a nonvolatile fluid melt. The tapped chloride was allowed to solidi fy. The alkali and alkaline earth chlorides likewise collected in the melt chamber. All ot her reaction products were carried off by the off gases. The important reactions occurring du ring chlorination are list ed in Table 3.2. The analysis of the rare earth chloride obtained is given in Table 3.1. The chlorination furnace was operated w ith alternating current at low voltage (10–20 V) and high currents (2000–3000 A) wi th the loose layers of coke and of the oooooo Figure 3.18 Diagram of chlorination furnace (Brugger and Greinacher 1967). 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 153 ore–carbon briquettes functioning as the elect rical resistance. The furnace was designed for high thermal loads and had a capacity of 100 tons/month of rare earth chloride. It consumed chlorine at the rate of 0.9–1.0 kg/kg RECl3 and the energy consumption was 0.4–0.6 kWh/kg RECl3. The process was described (Brugger and Grei nacher 1967) as suitable for chlorination of not only bastnasite, but also ores like monazite, allanite, cerite, xenotime, euxenite, fergusonite, gadolinite, etc. When monazite or xenotime is chlorinated, regrinding of the ore before mixing with carbon and compacting is not necessary. The required temperature of chlorination is higher for silicates and phos phates than for oxidic ores or niobates and tantalates. Brugger and Greinacher (1967) cite severa l advantages of the process. The economic advantages include simplicity, low labor co mponent, small space requirement, and low capital costs. Energy costs are also very sma ll. The process yields anhydrous chlorides of the rare earths without oxide or oxychloride content, clearly separated from impurities, at a very high specific throughput. Chlorination of Baotau concentrates A process essentially similar to that described by Brugger and Grenaicher (1967) was used to ch lorinate Baotau rare earth concentrate on a production scale. The concentrate consisted ma inly of bastnasite and monazite, and certain other minerals that could be chlorinated in the presence of carbon at high temperatures. A laboratory experiment has been described (Li et al. 1986) as follows. The rare earth concentrate (60 to 70% REO) was mixed with ch arcoal (ratio of concentrate to fixed carbon in charcoal = 1 : 0.065–0.070) and pressed into briquettes which were dried at 120–140°C and then chlorinated. Chlorination was ca rried out in a 90 mm dia and 300 mm long graphite reactor at 950–1100°C. The chlo rides with lower boiling points, like FeCl3, SiCl4, ThCl4 were removed from the high temperature zo ne with the off gas, while the low vapor pressure chlorides like CaCl2, BaCl2 remained with the rare earth chloride. By this process over 91% of the rare earths contained in the concentrate was recovered as the chloride. The chlorine consumption was 0.84 kg/kg RECl3 and energy consumption was 1 kWh/kg RECl3. Apparently the Chinese runs, which have been tried only on a laboratory scale, were slightly more economical in chlorine consumption an d slightly more expensive in energy consumption as compared to the Go ldschmidt runs.

The rare earth chlorides have been used for electrowinning of metals. 3.4.4 Xenotime The process options for treating xenotime are s hown in Figure 3.19. The acid process for xenotime breakdown (Banks et al . 1959, Powell and Spedding 1959) involves attacking with concentrated (93%) sulfur ic acid. The rare earth phosphates are converted to water soluble sulfates by leaching xe notime concentrates in conc. H2SO4 at 250–300°C for 1–2 h. Such leaching was uneconomical for con centrates containing less than 10% xeno- time. These are treated by wetting the solids with sufficient acid and heating the mass at 300°C followed by water leaching. About 80–90% of the rare earths are solubilized. The recovery of rare earths by processes such as double sulfate precipitation is not possible because yttrium and the heavy rare earth sulfat es are quite soluble. The sulfate solution is directly taken for separation. In the alternativ e process, the fine ground xenotime is treated by fusing it with molten caus tic soda at 400°C (Topp 1965) or by mixing it with sodium carbonate and roasting at 900°C for several hou rs (Lever and Payne 1968). After leaching Figure 3.19 Chemical processing of xenotime. Figure 3.20 Xenotime processing in Malaysia. 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 155 out the phosphates, the hydrox ide residue is dissolved in a minimum amount of hydro- chloric acid and filtered from impurities such as silica, cassiterite, et c. The rare earths are recovered by precipitation as oxalates. The xenotime processing plant of the Malaysian Rare Earth Corporation (MAREC) is located at Bukit Merah in Perak state, Mala ysia. The process used in the plant for the production of yttrium oxide concentrate from xenotime is outlined (Sulaiman 1991) in Figure 3.20. The xenotime is first milled to a required particle size and then roasted in a furnace. These operations ensure that good recovery is obtained in the next stage, which is sulfuric acid digestion of the roasted material . By sulfuric acid digestion, YPO4 in the xenotime is converted to the water soluble sulfate. Cold water is used as the leachant for better recovery. Oxalic acid is added to the yttrium su lfate solution to precipitate yttrium oxalate. The final stage is the calcination of yttrium oxalate to the oxide. The plant has a capacity to produce 200 tons of yttrium concentrate (60% Y2O3) per annum. 3.4.5 Elliot Lake Uranium Ore The Elliot Lake uranium mines in Canada, upon demand, produce 60 to 70% REO concen- trate from barren uranium leachate (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). At the Elliot Lake uranium mines, a large volume of barren liqu or, relatively free from uranium but containing lanthanides and thorium, is generated. The li quor is generated from sulfuric acid leaching of uranium ores followed by removal of ur anium from the filtered leach liquor by ion exchange. The minerals brannerite, uraninit e, and uranothorite from which uranium was leached contain lanthanum, yttrium, ytterbiu m, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, sama- rium, thorium, and lesser quantities of dysp rosium and erbium. In the leaching process currently used, even though only about 20% of total rare earths in the ore is leached, appro- ximately 75% of yttrium in the ore is leached along with uranium and thorium. Thus, after the removal of uranium by ion exchange, the barren liquor contains considerable amounts of yttrium and other rare earths, which can be recovered (Ritcey and Ashbrook 1979). The barren acid solutions are treated with li me and air in Pachuka tanks to a pH of about 8.5. The resultant oxidized slurry is thickened. The th ickener underflow is recovered for further treatment and the clear overflow is sent to the tailings. The underflow is acidi- fied with H2SO4 to a pH of about 4.2 to redissolve yt trium and the rare earths and is filtered off from the iron, thorium, aluminum etc., in th e solids. The rare earth s are then precipitated with ammonia gas, thickened, and dried. The concentrate contains approximately 8–15% Y2O3 and 12–30% total REO, including yttrium. 3.4.6 GadoliniteThe processes for chemical treatment of gadoli nite are outlined in Figure 3.21. The rare earths have been recovered from gadolinite by leaching the ground ore with nitric or hydrochloric acid and precipitating the rare ear ths as oxalates, thus effecting the separation from associated iron and beryllium (Foos and Wilhelm 1954). Concentrated sulfuric acid or a mixture of sodium hydroxide and sodium pe roxide have also been used to attack the ore. 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 156 3.4.7 Euxenite Euxenite has been treated by reductive chlorina tion followed by distillation of the chlorides to separate rare earths, titanium, niobium, an d tantalum fractions (Henderson et al. 1958). The processes for chemical treatment of euxe nite are shown in Figure 3.22. Solvent ex- traction has also been used to remove tantal um–niobium chlorides and the rare earth metals from the chlorination residue. The ore is also amenable to treatment by fusion with ammo- nium bisulfate or caustic soda or by digestion with hydrofluoric or sulfuric acid or mixtures of the two (Shaw 1959, Shaw and Bauer 1959). The ore has also been processed by digest- ion in hot sodium hydroxide so lution. The hydroxides of rare earths uranium, thorium, and iron formed are dissolved in diluted hydrochlo ric acid (Hedrick 1985). Soda ash is added to this solution to form a complex carbonate precipitate. The precipitate is leached with a dilute sulfuric acid to selectiv ely solubilize the rare earths. Fr om the leach liquor, rare earths are precipitated as oxalates by adding oxalic acid. Euxenite was considered as a potential future source of rare earths (Jackson and Christiansen 1993). Figure 3.21 Chemical processing of gadolinite. Figure 3.22 Chemical processing of euxenite. 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 157 3.4.8 Loparite, Pyrochlore, Fergusonite, and Samarskite Loparite is decomposed on an industrial scal e by chlorination in th e former Soviet Union. Pyrochlore can be processed to yield a niobiu m rich rare earth concentrate. The process described by Villani (1980) begins with dige stion of pyrochlore ore in hydrofluoric acid, followed by solvent extraction of niobium by MIBK (methylisobutylketone). In another process, the ore is first digested with hot concentrated sulfuric acid. Niobium and rare earths are then selectively precipitated by gradual reduction of acid concentration and temperature (Charlot 1976). Rare earths are recoverable from fergusonite and samarskite by a hot caustic digestion followed by an acid dissolution process. Th e process is similar to that described for euxenite. 3.4.9 Apatite The apatite deposit at Phalaborwa in South Africa contains significant amounts of rare earth metals and is a feed material to a wet process phosphoric acid plant in the same locality. In the process for phosphoric acid pr oduction, the apatite concentrate is dissolved in a mixture of sulfuric acid and recycled di lute phosphoric acid. Bulk of the rare earth values, 70–85% of that contained in the feed, end up in the copious amount of phosphogypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) formed in the dissolution reaction. The remainder of the rare earth values dissolve in the crude dilute phosphoric acid (27% P2O5) but eventually precipitate in the form of sludg es that settle out when the dilu te acid is concentrated to com- mercial grade (54% P2O5). These sludges consist mainly of calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CaSO4·1/2H2O) but also 2–8% of rare earths (REO). The amount of sludge produced is very substantial (~10,000 t/a) at the Phalaborwa plant alone, and it represents a valuable source of the rare earth metals. The sludge was washed and leached with dilu te nitric acid to which calcium nitrate was added. Leaching was carried out in a mech anically agitated flat bottomed stainless steel pachuka, and over 85% of rare earths co ntained in them were solubilized. From the leach liquor that contains nitr ic acid, calcium nitrate, and ad ded ammonium nitrate, the rare earths were recovered by solvent extraction and finally precipitated as rare earth oxalates from the strip solution. The oxalates were cal cined in a rotary furnace to yield mixed rare earth oxide of 89–94% purity. Rare earth oxid es have also been recovered from apatites in the former Soviet Union and Finland during th e production of phosphoric acid for fertilizer. The ore is leached with nitric acid and from th e leach liquor the silicic and fluorsilicic salts are precipitated by sodium nitrate. On part ial neutralization of the leach liquor with ammonia, the rare earth phosphates are precip itated. From the phosphates, the rare earths are redissolved in nitric acid and are precipitate d in a purer form as oxalates by the addition of oxalic acid. In all the processes described, the products obtained after chemical processing of rare earth minerals contain the rare earths in es sentially the same ratio in which they were originally present in the ore. This is because of the similar chemical behavior of the various rare earth elements in the reactions involved in these treatments. Operations such as double sulfate precipitation used for separating thoriu m result in partial rare earth separations in the two fractions, one enriched in the cerium gr oup rare earths and the other enriched in the yttrium group rare earths. The separation of cerium is also accomplished during chemical03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 158 processes, involving its oxidation to Ce(IV). The subject of separation of rare earths is covered in the following section. Perhaps no other branch of rare earths extractive metal- lurgy has attracted so much attention and res earch effort as the separation of naturally occurring rare earth mixtures into pu re individual compound intermediates. 3.5 SEPARATION PROCESSES The various processes for separating individu al rare earths from naturally occurring rare earth mixtures essentially utilize the small di fferences in basicity resulting from decrease in ionic radius from lanthanum to lutetium. Th e basicity differences influence the solubility of salts, the hydrolysis of ions, and the fo rmation of complex species, and these properties form the basis of separation procedures by fr actional crystallization, fractional precipita- tion, ion exchange, and solvent extraction. In ad dition to a trivalent oxidation state, Ce, Pr, and Tb can also occur in the tetravalent stat e, and Sm, Eu, and Yb also exhibit divalency. Selective oxidation or reduction of these elemen ts is useful in effective separation because in the divalent and tetravalent states the elements exhibit markedly different chemical behavior compared to that in the trivalent state. 3.5.1 Selective Oxidation The most abundant rare earth, cerium, can be separated relatively easily and early in the separation sequence. This simplifies the subs equent separation of the less abundant rare earths. Cerium is removed from the rare ea rths mixture after oxidation of naturally occurring Ce(III) to Ce(IV). This valence change occurs, for example, when bastnasite is heated in air at 650°C or when the rare earth hydroxides are dried in air at 120–130°C. In aqueous hydroxide suspensions, ox idation is effected by chlori nation or electrolysis (Bauer et al. 1960, Douglas and Bauer 1959). An effective method of cerium removal from a complex lanthanides solution was suggested by an oxidation–precipitation process using ozone as the oxidizing agent. Once oxidized, Ce(IV) is separated (Bril 1964) from the trivalent components in the rare earth hydr oxide–oxide mixtures either by selective Figure 3.23 Separation of cerium by selective oxidation. 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 159 dissolution of trivalent species with dilute acid (Powell 1939) or by complete dissolution in concentrated acid followed by selective precipitation. The precipitation of even 99.8% pure ceric salts does not completely remove cerium from solution and additional cerium removal steps are necessary to prepare rare earths free from cerium. A process considered particularly effective for cerium recovery fr om any acid leachate solution containing rare earths uses air oxidation and solvent extract ion as shown in Figure 3.23. A number of reagents have been studied for the solvent extraction of Ce(IV) n itrate and TBP is the preferred extractant for large s cale operations (Bauer et al . 1960, Douglas and Bauer 1959). Unlike Ce(IV), both Pr(IV) and Tb(IV) are no t stable in aqueous solution. The higher oxides PrO2 and Tb4O7 precipitate when a solution of ra re earth hydroxides in fused potas- sium hydroxide is oxidized either by anodic oxygen or by potassium chlorate. The oxides are recovered by decantation or by dissolving away the melt. 3.5.2 Selective Reduction Samarium, europium, and ytterbium can be easi ly separated from the trivalent rare earths mixture after reducing them to a divalent state. Unlike cerium, these elements are much less abundant, and separation using reduction is ca rried out only after th ey have been enriched by other procedures. The first application of se lective reduction for the separation of a rare earth was by Yntema (1930). Using a mercur y cathode he electrolytically reduced Eu(III) to Eu(II). Lithium amalgam electrodes were used for separation of Sm from Eu, and Yb by selective reduction. Recently, the continuo us electrolytic reduction of Eu(III) to Eu(II) in rare earth chloride solutions derived from mona zite was demonstrated in a redox flow cell. Marsh (1942, 1943, 1957) had separated sa marium, europium, and ytterbium from rare earth mixtures in a buffered acetate solution by reductive extraction into dilute sodium amalgam. The separation is clear and comple te and the method is amenable to counter current operation. It has been used commerci ally (Lever and Payne 1968) for the recovery of samarium and ytterbium. The recovery of pure europium from such amalgams is achieved by treatment with cold concentrated hydrochloric acid, which causes precipitation of the sparingly soluble EuCl2·2H2O. Both Sm and Yb are rapidl y oxidized to very soluble trihalides, whereas the oxidation of Eu pro ceeds very slowly in the absence of oxygen. On an industrial scale, the method deve loped by McCoy (1936, 1941) has found ac- ceptance. In a chloride solution, Eu(III) is reduc ed to Eu(II) by zinc, and the divalent Eu is recovered as sulfate. The process is shown in Figure 3.24. Zinc does not reduce Sm or Yb. When Eu is present only in a low concentration, EuSO4 is recovered by coprecipitation with BaSO4. The mixed sulfate precipitate is wash ed with an oxidizing acid solution to reoxidize and dissolve Eu(III), leaving BaSO4 undissolved. The purity of Eu recovered in this process can be improved to 99.9% by precipitating EuCl2·2H2O from concentrated HCl. Recently, the separation of Eu has been achieved by photochemical means. Europium can be separated from other rare earths by a photochemical reduction to the divalent stage followed by precipitation of th e divalent europium as sulfate or chloride (Shastri et al . 1988). The photochemical separation wa s investigated using a low pressure mercury lamp with no filter at 185 nm, and with a Vycor filter at 254 nm and an ArF excimer laser operating at 193 nm. Equimola r mixtures (0.01 M) of binary and ternary lanthanide perchlorates and 0.05 M K2SO4 in 10% isopropanol were irradiated. The separation factor for Eu/RE varied from 1 fo r Eu/Pr and >200 for Eu/Tm. The process is represented by03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 160 Eu3+(H2O) Eu2+ + H+ + .OH The OH radical was scavenged by isopropanol as (CH3)2CHOH + .OH → H2O + (CH2)2·COH The sulfate ion present in solution causes precipitation of Eu2+ as EuSO4. Besides, the presence of sulfate ions makes possible the sh ift of the charge transfer band to the longer wavelength light at 240 nm. Eu2+ is also reduced by the or ganic radicals by the reaction (CH3)2·COH + Eu3+ → Eu2+ + H+ + (CH3)2C=O The precipitate of EuSO4 is formed homogeneousl y during the photolysis. Qui et al . (1991) studied the separation of Eu from a solution mixture of SmCl3, EuCl3 and GdCl3, in a rare earth saturated ethanol–isopropanol system. The photo reduction of Eu was carried out with a high pressure me rcury lamp. From the alcohol mixture, EuCl2 was produced by photoreduction and precipitation. The precipitated EuCl2 was 92% pure and the yield of Eu(II) was 95%. The whole sepa ration process is represented as follows: Dissolution and complexion (Sm, Eu, Gd)Cl3·nH2O + 3EtOH → (Sm, Eu, Gd)Cl3·3EtOH + nH2O (Sm, Eu, Gd)Cl3·nH2O + 3(isopropanol) → (Sm, Eu, Gd)·Cl3·3(isopropanol) + nH2O190 nm Figure 3.24 Separation of europium by selective reduction. 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 161 Photoexcitation (Sm, Eu, Gd)Cl3·nH2O + 3EtOH (Sm, Eu, Gd)Cl3·3EtOH (Sm, Eu, Gd)Cl3·nH2O + 3(isopropanol) (Sm, Eu, Gd)Cl3·3(isopropanol) Electron transition EuCl3·3EtOH → EuCl2 + 2EtOH + organic oxidation products EuCl3·3(isopropanol) → EuCl2 + 2(isopropanol) + organic oxidation products. Even though Sm(III), Eu(III), and Gd(III) are all excited during photoreduction, only the reduction of Eu(III)–Eu(II) is possible and occurs because the reduction potential of Sm(III) and Gd(III) are more negative than that of Eu(III)/Eu(II). Precipitation The solubility of EuCl2 in an ethanol–isopropanol mixt ure is low. This leads to the precipitation and hence separation of EuCl2 from the other rare earths in the mixture. In order to precipitate EuCl2, the water content of the alco hol mixture must be kept low. A method of separating samarium, europium, and ytterbium is based on the fact that Sm, Eu, and Yb metals cannot be obtained by metallothermic reduction of their halides. During the reduction of a mixture of anhydrous rare earth halides with calcium, the halides of Sm, Eu, and Yb are not reduced and remain in the slag from which they are subsequently separated. Samarium, which only reduces to the divalent state, also accumulates in the fused salt slag when the mixed rare earth chloride is el ectrolytically reduced to misch metal. The slag has been an inexpensive source of samarium for some time (Gschneidner and Daane 1988). Before 1950, in addition to the separation procedures based on selective oxidation or reduction, the methods based on fractional crys tallization and fractional precipitation were widely used for rare earth separations. The co nsiderable effort spanning over 100 years that was applied to the problem of separation us ing these techniques has been extensively reviewed (Little 1921, Yost et al . 1947, Kremers 1953, Moeller 1963). 3.5.3 Fractional Crystallization In fractional crystallization, a part of the sa lt in solution is precipitated by a change in temperature or by evaporation of a saturated solution. If the solubility of various com- ponents in the solution differ, the composition of the crystal crop will be different from that of the original solution. While the crystal cr op becomes enriched in the less soluble com- ponent, simultaneously, the more soluble co mponents will be enriched in the liquor. More than half a dozen salts and double salts have been used for the separation of rare earth elements by fractional crystallization. Th is method has been considered as the best of the classical separation procedures for producing individual elements in high purity (Parker and Baroch 1971). The most suitable compou nds have been the double ammonium nitrates RE(NO3)3·2NH4NO3·4H2O for the removal of lanthanum and separation of praseodymium and neodymium, and the double magnesium nitrates 2RE(NO3)3·3Mg(NO3)2· 24H2O for obtaining concentrates containing the mi ddle rare earths samarium, europium, and gadolinium. The double manganese nitrates 2RE(NO3)3·3Mn(NO3)2·24H2O have also been used in the separation of the ceric grou p. In the separation of the yttric group, the bromates RE(BrO3)3·9H2O and ethyl sulfates RE(C2H5SO4)3·9H2O have been found useful.hν hν03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 162 Erbium, thulium, lutetium, and yttrium have been separated using a rare earth hexa- antipyrine iodide salt. A sodium rare earth ED TA salt has also been useful (Marsh 1955) for separating gadolinium, terbium, dysprosi um, and yttrium by fractional crystallization. The separation by fractional crystallization of these salts has been used commercially (Lever and Payne 1968) to separate and rais e to 99% purity, oxides of Gd, Tb, and Dy. The lanthanum end of the series, where the differences in cationic radius are the greatest, is the most amenable for separation by fractio nal crystallization. Lanthanum forms the least soluble double nitrate. Starting from a ceriu m-free rare earth concentrate, a procedure for separating lanthanum in high purity involves the steps shown in Figure 3.25. From the rare earth concentrate solution, 90% La2O3 can be precipitated ou t using an air–ammonia mixture. From this product high purity lant hanum is then obtained by purification using countercurrent crystallization of the double nitrates RE(NO3)2·2NH4NO3·4H2O. The fractional crystallization is particularly slow and tedious for the heavy rare earths and in the Sm(III)–Gd(III) region, because the property difference between rare earths decreases as the atomic number increases. For example, a bromate salt of a thulium fraction recrystallized 15,000 times still contained yt terbium and erbium. The rare earth bromate had to be crystallized every day fo r 4 years to obtain good holmium. 3.5.4 Fractional Precipitation Fractional precipitation denotes the removal of part of the rare earths from solution by the addition of a chemical reagent to form a ne w, less soluble compound. The rare earths still remaining in solution are recovered either by further precipitation as the same compound or by complete precipitation as the oxa late, hydroxide, or other compound. As with fractional crystallization, a number of compounds have been studied for the separation of rare earths by fractional preci pitation. The hydroxides and double sulfate, in particular, have been widely used. Double ch romate precipitation has also been used to Figure 3.25 Separation of lanthanum by fractional crystallization. 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 163 separate rare earths from yttrium. Among the ra re earth elements, hydrolysis occurs least extensively with lanthanum, which remains mo stly in solution. For large scale operation, ammonia is used for carrying out hydroxide precipitation from the nitrate or chloride (Berber et al . 1960) solutions. The preliminary enrichment of yttrium-group rare earths and the extraction of yttrium from yttrium concentr ates are also possible by this method. Lever and Payne (1968) have used fractional precipita tion of basic nitrates to separate a high proportion of yttrium from a h eavy rare earth concentrate. The double sulfates RE2(SO4)3·Na2SO4·nH2O are usually precipitated by the addition of sodium sulfate to the rare earth solution. The elements La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm form sparingly soluble double sulfates where as those of Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, and Y aresoluble; Eu, Gd, and Dy form double sulfates of intermediate solubility. Generally, the use of this method is confined to crude separati on of the rare earth mixture into three groups. However, the elements La and Y can also be readily separated. Yttrium (Powell 1961) exhibits interesting behavior in fractional precipitation and is amenable to purification by a combination of hydroxide and double sulfate precipitations. The separation factor, however, is very sm all. In double sulfate precipitation, yttrium behaves like holmium, and in basic precipitat ion it behaves like neodymium. By the first method, the elements La–Dy can be remove d and in the second method the elements Eu–Lu are removed. A method in which the mixture to be se parated was partially complexed with EDTA and the uncomplexed part was precipitated with sodium sulfate was also used. Earlier, a similar method had been proposed using oxalic acid as precipitating agent and nitrilotri- acetic acid as the complexing agent. Double chromates of rare earths with ammonium or potassium, precipitated from chloride solutions have been found suitable for the industrial pr oduction of high purity yttrium. For the separation of the heavy ra re earths a method based on fractional thermal decomposition of fused nitrates has also been investigated. In the years preceding 1947, the methods outlined thus far were the techniques available for separating the rare earths. Fo r most of the rare earths elements, these procedures were relatively inefficient and laborious. The purity of the end products obtained was also not comparable with that subsequently achieved in the modern methods of ion exchange and solvent extraction, which have dominated the commercial separationof rare earths starting in the 1950s. 3.5.5 Ion Exchange Method An ion exchange resin or ion exchanger can be considered as an ionic salt in which one of the ions is attached to an insoluble organic matrix (Kleber and Love 1963). In an anion exchange resin or anion exchanger the ch arge on the ion is negative. Similarly, the charge on the ion is pos itive in a cation exchanger. When the ion exchange resin comes into cont act with a salt solution, the mobile ion in the resin matrix may be displaced. Generally, (1 ) an ion of higher charge displaces an ion of lower charge, (2) between similarly charged io ns, that with a larger radius displaces the one with the smaller radius, and (3) the disp lacement occurs according to the law of mass action. The technique of ion exchange essentially in volves the adsorption stage in which the ions from the solution get loaded or adsorbed on the exchanger and an elution stage during03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 164 which, by a change of conditions, the ions desorb from the exchanger and enter into solution. In either step, an exchange betw een the ions in solution and those on the exchanger occurs. When more than one anion or cation is present in the solution and if certain selectivity is exhibited in these exchan ges, the ion exchange process becomes an ion exchange separation. According to the distribution law or par tition law (Kleber and Love 1963) under equilibrium conditions, when a substance is di stributed between two phases, the ratio of the concentration of the substance in two phases w ill have a constant value. For instance if the equilibrium concentration of the substance A in phase 1 is CA1 and in phase 2 is CA2 then DA, called the distribution coefficient, is If there is another substance B wh ich is similarly distributed, then Figure 3.26 Simplified representation of events in displacement chromatography. (a) Column charged initially with A ions. (b) Column charged with a mixture of B and C ions — the order of increasing affinity is A, B, C; sin ce C has greater affinity for the resin than B, some separation of B and C occurs during loading. (c) Bands of B and C being developed with an eluant containing D ions which are more strongly attracted to the resin than A, B or C ions. (d) Developed band of B ions passing off the column. (e) Developed band of C ions passing off the column (Powell 1961). DACA1 CA2---------- = DBCB1 CB2---------- =03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 165 Usually the values of DA and DB are different. Comparison of DA and DB values gives information as to which of the two substan ces concentrates preferably, for example, in phase 1. In ion exchange, phase 1 can be taken as the resin phase, and in solvent extraction phase 1 can be taken as the organic phase. The other phase, phase 2, is the aqueous phase in both techniques. The ratio of the distribution coefficients, α, is called the separation factor. If α is close to 1, no separation can be achieved and separation is achievable if α is either very much more or less than unity. The term “ion exchange chromatography” was used (Powell 1961) to describe the technique for separating mixtures of ions based on sorption (adsorption) of the ions on a suitable ion exchanger followed by differentia l displacement of the individual ions with an eluant. Two kinds of behaviors were ob served. One has been named “displacement chromatography” and the other “elution chromatography.” The events in displacement chromatography are shown in Figure 3.26. Two ionic species B and C are sorbed on top of an ex change bed on which was loaded originally a third ionic species A, which has less affinity for the exchanger than either B or C. When this system is eluted with a simple salt solution containing ion D, which has greater affinity for the resin than even B and C, each ion tends to displace that having lesser affinity and banding develops as shown in Figure 3.26. Th e sequence in which the ions come out of the exchanger is shown (Powell 1961) in Figure 3.27. There is separation. In elution chromatography, the ion sorbed initially and the eluant ion are usually the same. The eluant ion has a lesser affinity for the resin than the ions being separated. The equivalent concentration of the ions being eluted is less than the concentration of the eluant ion. Thus the eluant ion displaces the sorbed ions inefficiently and overruns them. Under the influence of the eluant and having differe nt affinities for the resin, the sorbed ions progress down the exchange beds at different rates. The type of elution curve (Powell 1961) shown in Figure 3.28 is then obtained. Application The first attempt on ion exchange se paration of rare earths dates back to the late nineteenth century, when it was demons trated in 1893 that yttrium and gadolinium Figure 3.27 Typical elution plot in displacemen t chromatography. Some overlapping of bands is inherent, but regions of considerable extent are obtained within which the equiva- lent concentration of each ion is equal to the equivalent concentration of the driving ion in the eluant (Powell 1961). αBA DA DB-------- =03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 166 could be purified by adsorpti on on activated carbon. After over a half-century gap it was shown that the simple procedure of adsorption of tripositive rare earth ions on an ion exchanger and their removal by elution with so dium chloride effected no greater separation than fractional crystallization or precipitation . This was subsequently found true for most cation exchange media. While there is a decreas e in the affinity of the rare earths for the resin from La(III) to Lu(III); i.e., as the size of the hydrated ion is decreased, the affinities of the various rare earth elements for the re sin are not sufficiently different to result in satisfactory separation because the separation factors for adjacent rare earths undergoing simple cation exchange are close to unity. This situation was changed by the use of complexing agents to enhance separation factors. The successful separation of rare earths by ion exchange was subsequently demonstrated at Ames and at Oak Ridg e National Laboratory by using a citric acid–ammonium citrate eluant at regulated pH an d was reported in a series of papers in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (Ketelle and Boyd 1947 ). The separation was achieved as a result of the different stabil ities of the citrate complexes formed by the individual rare earths in the mixture (Powel l and Spedding 1959, 1956, Powell 1964, Powell 1979). The citrate elution has been performed successfully under a wide range of conditions (Powell 1964) and has proved eff ective for the separation of up to several hundred grams each of the light rare earth elements. The differences between complex formation constants of adjacent heavy rare earth s are not as large as those between the light rare earths, and the citrate process has not b een very successful in separating bulk quantities of heavy rare earths. The extreme dilution of the eluant was also an economic disadvantage. Besides the citrate, a number of elutin g agents and process conditions have been actively evaluated, and they have been review ed by Powell (1961, 1964, 1979). The use of amino polyacetic acids such as NTA and et hylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) as eluants was investigated but was unsuccessful due to the problem of aqueous insolubility. This and many other limitations of the elution process were solved in the band displacement technique developed by Spedding et al . (1954), using the resin in a special cation state. Compared with citrates, complexing agents su ch as EDTA and 2-hydroxy ethylene diamine triacetic acid (HEDTA) not only form 1:1 ch elates of greater stability over wider pH ranges, but also give greater differences in st ability between adjacent rare earths and allow higher concentrations to be used. Commerciall y, the most useful complexing agents are EDTA and HEDTA. The acids diethylene triamine pentacetic acid (DTPA) and 1,2-diamine cyclohexane tetraacetic acid (DCT A) also provide high separation factors Volume of eluate collectedC B Figure 3.28 Typical elution plot obtained by elution chromatography. Eluent ions over- run and accompany the B band and the C band as they issue from the column (Powell 1961). Concentration03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 167 (Powell 1964, 1979). Powell (1979) has discu ssed the separation potential of each of these chelating agents and ranks EDTA and HEDTA as the most useful. EDTA can effectively separate all of the rare earths and yttrium fro m each other with the exception of Eu–Gd and Yb–Lu pairs because of the small difference in the separation factor and adverse kinetic effects, respectively. The Dy–Y separation is also very slow with EDTA because of the small difference in the stability of the two co mplexes. There is, however, a large difference between the stabilities of HEDTA–Dy and HEDT A–Y complexes, and so this pair can be separated by HEDTA. Besides, HEDTA is particularly useful in the separation of the Tm–Yb–Lu fraction, and good separations are possible with either La–Ce–Pr–Nd– Y–Sm or Ho–Er–Tm–Yb–Lu mixtures. The separation of Sm–Eu–Gd–Tb–Dy–Homixture with HEDTA is poor because of sm all differences in chelate stabilities. An advantage of HEDTA elution is that hydrog en ion retaining beds can be used because H 3(HEDTA) is considerably more soluble in cold water than H4(EDTA). This permits easy recycling of reagent. The HEDTA complexes of heavy rare earths such as Tm, Yb, and Lu show only limited solubility and re strict the eluant concentration. For the rapid separation of yttrium, a two-stage procedure that makes use of the different positions of yttrium in the elution sequence with different chelating agents was reported. In the EDTA system, yttrium elut es between Tb and Dy, whereas in HEDTA it elutes between Nd and Sm. The heavy rare earths are first separated by elution with HEDTA leaving yttrium in the Nd fraction. Th is fraction is then eluted with EDTA to separate yttrium from neodymium. Temperature plays a crucial part in ion exch ange separations. Kettele and Boyd (1947) first reported the shifting in th e position of yttrium during elutio ns with 5% citrate. This was followed by investigations (Lindstrom and Winget 1962) on elutions at 87–90°C with citrate, lactate, and also EDTA, particularly for the separation of Y, Sm, Eu, and Tm. Lindstrom and Winget (1962) showed that the hydrogen ion could be used as retaining iron in rare earth separations with EDTA if th e system is operated at 90–95°C when H4(EDTA) becomes more soluble. Powell (1964, 1979) pointed out several other advantages of operation at 92°C. These include improved HETP (height equivalent of a theoretical plate) values and an increase in Gd–Eu and Eu–Sm separation factors. At all temperatures withEDTA, Y elutes between Tb and Dy, but with an increase in temperature to 92°C, Tb separation improves and there is a decrease in the Dy–Y separation. The rise in temperature also makes EDTA elution more effective fo r rare earth separation from non rare earth impurities, as, for example, in the case of th e Tb–Pb–Yb–Lu mixture, which is difficult to separate at room temperature. As pointed out above, HEDTA gives poor se paration of the elements Sm–Ho at room temperature. A much better separation beco mes possible at 92°C because of improvement in the adjacent element separation factor with rise in temperature (Powell 1979). The solu- bilities of species Tm(HEDTA), Yb(HEDTA), and Lu(HEDTA) increase with an increase in temperature, and eluant concentrations up to 0.072 M have been successfully used at 92°C compared with the maximum concentration of only 0.018 M at room temperature. In HEDTA elutions, there is a considerable shift in the position of yttrium with change in tem- perature (Morton and James 1967). The isolati on of yttrium on a large scale as a result of this shift has been studied. Powell (1979) has also pointed out that the poor kinetics observed in ion exchange elution with DTPA could be countered to some extent by an increase in temperature. The development of band displacement w ith ammonium ethylene diamine tetraacetate as the complexing agent established ion exchan ge as the main commercial process for rare03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 168 earth separation from the mid-1950s. The fact that it is feasible to separate a mixture of 15 rare earths into components exceeding 99.99% purity in one pass through the system and that the process can be scaled up to multi-to nne quantities, with possibilities of recovering and recycling water, and retaining ion and co mplexant, has led to the continued commercial use of ion exchange even after the entry of so lvent extraction in the field. A major limitation of the band displacement technique or of di splacement ion exchange chromatography is that the technique is inherently a batch process. Taniguchi et al . (1988) have succeeded in adopt- ing fixed column band displacement chromatogr aphy to the continuous annular chromato- graph (CAC). This technique, called conti nuous displacement chromatography (CDC), combines the processing capa bilities of fixed column batc h displacement chromatography with continuous operation of CAC and is ap plicable to any displacement chromatography separation that can be performed using conv entional batch fixed column chromatography. 3.5.6 Solvent Extraction Method The separation of rare earths by solvent extraction depends upon the preferential distribution of individual rare earths (either in the cationic form or as complex anions or as a neutral species) between two immiscible liquid phases that are in contact with each other. One of the liquid phases is an aqueous solutio n and the other is a non-aqueous phase in the organic phase. The expressions given for the di stribution coefficient and separation factor, earlier in connection with ion exchange separa tion, can also be used for solvent extraction separation also. In ion exchange, phase 1 was taken as the resin phas e and in solvent extrac- tion, phase 1 can be taken as the organic phase. Phase 2 is the aqueous phase in both cases. There are many advantages to using solven t extraction as the process for rare earth separation. One of them is that the rare earth loading in the solvent/extractant can be very high (~180 g REO/L). Therefore aqueous solutions with concentrations of 100–140 g Figure 3.29 Typical solvent extraction flowsheet.03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 169 REO/L can be used. These make the equipm ent required for the process very compact (McGill 1993). The organic phase used in solvent extr action usually consists of two or more substances. The extractant proper is responsible for collecting the rare earth species into the organic phase, however, the extractant is us ually too viscous to be used in a practical system. It is dissolved in a su itable solvent to ensure a good contact with the aqueous phase. The solvents are kerosene and certain aromatic s. A substance known as a modifier is also usually added to the organic phase to im prove the hydrodynamics of the system. The schematic of the solvent extraction proces s (Shibata 1991) is shown in Figure 3.29. Usually the transfer of metal ions from the aq ueous to the organic ph ase does not occur com- pletely in one contact. Multiple contacts are n ecessary. This also holds true for scrubbing (contacting the loaded organic phase with an aqueous solution to collect back the impurities extracted by the solvent) and stripping (contact ing the scrubbed organic phase with an aque- ous solution to recover the main extracted speci es from the organic phase, back to the aque- ous phase). The beginning of solvent extraction separa tion of rare earths was made in the 1930s by the observations of Hopkins and Quill (1933) and a few years later by Fischer et al (1937). They found differences in the distribution of various rare ear th chlorides between water and partially miscible alcohols and ketones. Ap pleton and Selwood (1941) found a separation factor of 1.06 for the partition of lantha num, neodymium thiocyanate between water and n-butyl alcohol and suggested that a continuous counter current extraction might be effect- ive for separations. Higher separation factors of 1.29–1.55 depending on experimental con- ditions were obtained for the lanthanum– neodymium pair by Templeton and Peterson (1948), Templeton (1949) for the distribu tion of the nitrates between water and n-hexyl al- cohol. The important observation that Ce(IV) can be separated readily and completely from the trivalent cations in an aqueous nitric acid solution by extraction with tributyl phosphate (TBP), first made by Warf (1949) marked the be ginning of practical application of solvent extraction to rare earth separations. The TBP extraction of Ce(IV) was later investigated by Bauer (1959). A flowsheet for the purification of cerium and recovery of cerium nitrate by TBP extraction is given in Fig. 3.30. Cerium(IV ) is stripped from the organic phase best by its reduction to cerium(III) using, for ex ample, hydrogen peroxide (Warf 1949). 2[Ce(NO3)4(TBP)2]org + [H2O2]aq = 2[Ce3+]aq + 8[NO3]aq–+ 2[H+]aq + O2 + 4[TBP]org In such processes cerium dioxide products of high purity (>99.99%) are obtained from the strip liquors. The extractability of rare earths with TBP from concentrated hydrochloric and nitric acid solutions has been studied at Argonne National Laboratory (Peppard et al. 1953, 1958). The studies showed that extractions with TBP are more effective in nitrate sys- tems and that the TBP– nitric acid system could be used to separate the trivalent rare earths from one another. In 1953 Oak Ridge National La boratory isolated the first kilogram of pure Gd2O3 (98% Gd2O3) by using TBP–nitric acid solvent extraction using a mixed rare earth feed containing 25% Gd2O3 (Weaver et al. 1953). Using a similar technique, Weaver (1974) obtained better than 98% pure Sm2O3. The separation of rare earths from monazite using TBP (Ritcey and Pouskouleli 1987 ) was investigated by Bochinski et al. (1953, 1958). Foos and Wilhelm (1954) extended this work to st udy the separation of yttrium and heavy rare earths. A complete scheme for the separation of all the rare earths by solvent extraction was proposed by Callow (1967). However, the sepa ration of rare earths beyond terbium with TBP has been difficult (Powell 1979)..03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 170 Peppard et al . (1957) first suggested the use of HDEHP for rare earth separations. HDEHP may be used either in chloride or sulfate systems both for obtaining rare earth concentrates from complex mixtures and to isol ate individual rare earths in high purity. 99.8% pure lanthanum oxide was obtained using HDEHP in a 14-stage countercurrent extraction from a didymium chlo ride feed containing 45% La2O3, 35% Nd2O3, 10% Pr6O11, and 5% Sm2O3. By selective stripping of a prel oaded solvent, Bauer and Lindstrom (1971) recovered >99% pure samarium oxide. The organic solvent (1 M HDEHP inkerosene) was loaded with a RE mixture 60% in Sm 2O3, and the aqueous scrubbing solution contained 1.5% HCl and 20% NH4Cl. Many amines have also been examined for use in rare earth separations. Of these, terti- ary amine extraction has received particular at tention. An euxenite concentrate containing 47% yttria was processed using tri- n-butyl-amine solvent in 3- methyl-2-butanone and an aqueous phase of 8 M HNO3 (Gruzensky and Engel 1959). The product obtained was 83% yttrium oxide. Other amine types such as tri- iso-octylamine (TIOA), methyl-dioctyl-amine (MDOA), dodecyl-amine (DDA) and alamine have also been used for the separation of rare earths (Rice and Stone 1962). These early and experimental works were fo llowed by many investigations in later years, and solvent extraction developed as a ma jor technique for rare earths separation. The solvent extraction of rare earths has been re viewed by Peppard (1964), Weaver (1974), Sherrington (1983), Preston and Du Preez (1990), and Bautista (1995). Numerous extractants have been used for analytical or experimental separation of rare earths from one another; however, only a relati vely few are used in industrial practice. They include cation exchange extractants such as organophosphorus acids and carboxylic acids, neutral extractants such as tri- n-butyl-phosphate, and anion exchange extractants such as the amines. Among these, the primary industrial extractants used for the separation of rare earths by solvent extraction are di-2-ethyl-hex yl-phosphoric acid (HDEHP), 2-ethyl-hexyl- 2-ethyl-hexyl-phosphonic acid (EHEHPA), tr ibutyl-phosphate (TBP), versatic acid, versatic 10, and Aliquat 336. These are list ed in Table 3.3. Even though considerable published information is available on the extr action behavior of these solvents, the details of solvent extraction processes actually practi ced in the industry are well-kept secrets. Figure 3.30 Separation and purification of cerium. 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 171 Organophosphorus acids Monobasic organophosphorus acids include the well- known phosphoric, phosphonic , and phosphinic acids. Di-2 -ethyl-hexyl-phosphoric acid, HDEHP, is the most investigated and most readily available organophosphorus acid. The organophosphorus acids are typical cation ex change extractants. The extraction by cation exchange involves most commonly the displ acement of a hydrogen ion from the extractant by the extracted metal, resulting in the format ion of an electrically neutral, organic soluble complex. In organic solvents of low polari ty, the organophosphorus acids exist in the dimeric form H2A2, and the extraction is, therefore, represented by [RE3+]aq + [3(HA)2]org → [RE(HA2)3]org + 3[H+]aq As indicated by this reaction, the extract ion is strongly pH dependent, inversely proportional to the third power of hydrogen io n concentration. As a consequence, in nitric or hydrochloric acid solutions, the minimum va lue of distribution coefficient is reached at an acid concentration of 3 N. For any gi ven organophosphorus acid, the extraction efficiency of rare earths increases with an increase in atomic numb er. This could possibly result from the increase in th e strength of the electrostatic attraction between the extractant anion (HA2)–and the rare earth cation, as the size of the cation decreases. The extraction of yttrium lies in the dysprosium–holmium–erb ium region as could be anticipated on the basis of its cationic radius. On the same basis, it would also be anticipated that Ce(IV) is more preferentially extracted than the trival ent rare earth ion, and Eu(II) is not extracted when RE3+ is present. These characteristics could be used to separate cerium and europium from the rare earths mixture. The distribution coefficient in HDEHP–rare earth systems increases with an increase in atomic number (and decreases in trivalent ionic radii), and the variation in the system HDEHP/perchloric acid is shown in Figure 3. 31. HDEHP gives good separation factors for all rare earth elements. The average separati on factor for adjacent rare earth elements is ~2.5. The separation factors in the syst em HDEHP/HCl are listed in Table 3.4. HDEHP can extract from a variety of aque ous media, including nitrate, sulfate, chloride, and perchlorate, and the influence of the anion of the rare earth salt on the sepa- ration is considered to be generally small. The anion, however, apparently plays a role in certain cases. Even though HDEHP can extract from both chloride and nitrate solutions, it is considered to extract better from the ch loride than the nitrate medium. Chlorides or sulfates are preferred for the separation of neodymium and samarium. Besides, sulfates areTable 3.3 Commercially used extractants for rare earth separation (Thakur 2000) Extractant Molecular formula Tributyl-phosphate (TBP) (C4H9O)3PO Di-2-ethyl-hexyl-phosphoric acid (HDEHP) (C8H17O)2POOH 2-ethyl-hexyl-2-ethyl-hexyl-phosphonic acid (EHEHPA)Trade names: PC88A, Ionquest 801(C 8H17O)C8H17 POOH Versatic acidVersatic 10(R 1.R2.R3).C.COOH C9H19C.COOH; (R1.R2.R3 = C8H19) Trialkyl-methyl-ammonium-chlorideTrade name: Aliquat 336R 3CH3N+Cl–03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 172 apparently more selective for the separation of cerium earths from the other rare earth elements (McGill 1993). Generally, the separation factor is not great ly influenced by the total concentration of the rare earth element and also not by the re lative concentrations of the various elements (McGill 1993). The distribution coefficients of rare earths decrease with an increase in tem- perature, and the effect of temperature is great er for the heavy rare earths. The distribution coefficient has been found to be dependent on the diluent for the organophosphorus acid and decreases in the order kerosene > cyclohexane > CCl4 > xylene > benzene. HDEHP in kerosene is usually chosen as the extractant. In HDEHP extractions there is also a possib ility that separations can be enhanced by the use of scrubbing circuits in which exchan ge reactions, which are pH independent, like the following, occur: [Sm3+]aq + [Nd(HA2)3]org → [Sm(HA2)]org + [Nd3+]aq The extraction of rare earths by di-2-et hyl-hexyl-phosphinic acid in toluene was investigated by Preston and Du Preez (1990). They found that the distribution coefficient increased in the order La < Ce < Pr < Nd < Sm < Eu < Gd < Tb < Dy < Ho < Y < Er < Tm < Yb < Lu. Based on these data, they concl uded that the organophosphorus acids could be particularly useful for separating the rare earth mixture into light, middle, and heavy oooooo Figure 3.31 Distribution coefficient kRE relative to kY= 1 in the system (a) HDEHP/ perchloric acid; (b) TBP with 50% kerosene/r are earth nitrates (REO 450 gpl) (Pierce and Peck 1963, McGill 1993). 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 173 fractions. The light and middle fractions co uld be conveniently split between neodymium and samarium, and the separation of middle and heavy fractions could be advantageously made between gadolinium and terbium. The extraction of lanthanide chlorides by 2-ethyl-hexyl-2-ethyl-hexyl-phosphonic acid (EHEHPA), also known as PC88A, in ke rosene was also reported. The separation factors are listed in Table 3.5. The extraction efficiency for the rare earths in EHEHPA also increases with atomic number but is lowe r in comparison with HDEHP under the same conditions. EHEHPA, however, is more selectiv e for the separation of heavy rare earths from light rare earths. EHEHPA is preferred as an extractant for the separation of rare earth elements due to the high separation factors between any two adjacent rare earth elements compared to HDEHP. In the past decade, PC 88A has practically replaced HDEHP in many of the applications where HDEHP was originally used for the industrial solvent extraction separation of rare earths. As mentioned earlier, the organophosphorus acids are liquid cation exchangers and liberate hydrogen ion during the loading of the extractant with the rare earth ions. This liberated hydrogen ion, i.e., the increase in the solution acidity, adversely affects metal extraction. This problem is circumvented by saponifying the extractant with NaOH. The degree of saponification is restricted, howeve r, to avoid gel formation due to excessive loading of rare earths and to avoid solubility of saponified solvent in the aqueous phase. The organic phase typically containing 1.0 M PC88A in kerosene (mainly paraffinic and naphthenic hydrocarbon in the C10–C14 range), containing 5% (v/v) isodecanol, after 20% saponification with NaOH, has been used fo r extraction of rare earths from a chloride aqueous solution (Koppiker 1990).

The extraction, represented by 3[R3C·COOH]org + [RE3+]aq → [(REC·COO)3RE]org + 3H+ is conducted in a neutral or weakly acidic medium. Carboxylic acids are commercially avail- able and are relatively inexpensive. The most widely used amo ng the carboxylic acids for rare earth extraction are the versatic acids R1R2(CH3)C·COOH, where R1 and R2 are branched chain alkyl groups. Versatic 911 has 9 to 11 carbon atoms and vers atic 10 has 10 carbon atoms. These two are the most important and widely used. The sepa ration factors for versatic 911 are listed in Table 3.6. The separation factors for La–Ce and Ce–Pr are 3 and 1.6, respectively, and these values are higher than those for TBP extraction. For Nd–Pr onward, the separation factors are similar to the TBP system (Brown and Sherrington 1979).

This reagent also extracts the heavy rare earths. Naphthenic acids are represented by the gene ral formula RCOOH, where R is a radical derived predominantly from cyclopentane or a homolog of cyclopentane. Naphthenic acid with diethyl ether or n-hexanol as a diluent was used with some success as an extractant for rare earth sulfates (Bauer and Lindstrom 1964 ). Rare earth extraction was dependent on pH, naphthenic acid concentration, and the mol ra tio of naphthenic acid and the rare earth. The separation factor was enhanced to 2.2 for ad jacent yttrium group elements by the addition of an aqueous phase chelating agent such as EDTA. Similarly, the addition of DTPA en- hanced the separation factor to 3.5 for adj acent yttrium group elements (Bautista 1995). Solvating extractants In extraction by solvation, the extractant replaces some or all of the coordinated water molecules from the aquated metal ion to form a species that is soluble in the organic phase. The most important solva ting extractant for rare earth refining is tri- n- butyl-phosphate (TBP) and the extraction of a trivalent rare earth by TBP (see Table 3.7) can be represented by the general reaction [RE(NO3)3·xH2O]aq + 3[TBP]org → [RE(NO3)3(TBP)3]org + xH2O Under a given set of conditions, the lanthani de stabilities of the complexes and hence their extractabilities might be expected to increase through the series from La3+ to Lu3+, as the cationic radius decreases because the electrostatic inte raction between the cation and ligand should be proportional to the recipr ocal of cationic radius. Once the cationic radius is beyond a certain size, however , steric considerations overru le electrostatic effects. This is indicated by the existence of a maxima, as given in Figure 3.32, in the extractions by neutral organophosphorus compounds. In the TB P system, the extraction of yttrium usually lies between that of erbium and thulium. The separation of yttrium from lighter lantha nides, e.g., lanthanum, increases marked- ly with an increase in nitrate concentration; however, there is no such change on yttrium separation from the heavier rare earths, e.g., thulium. Rare earth nitrates up to a concentratio n of 0.5 mol/L (~170–190 g REO/L) can be loaded in pure TBP. The effect of temperatur e is small.

It was observed by Preston and Du Preez (1990) that TBP and other neutral organo- phosphorus compounds are useful in the bulk recovery of the rare earth product from nitrate liquors, but they are less useful in separati ons among the trivalent lanthanides because the separation factors for adjacent rare earth pairs are generally small, in the range 1.2 to 2.2. This may be compared to the average separatio n factor of ~2.8 for HDEHP extraction from a nitrate medium. Amines Long chain quaternary ammonium salts, R3CH3N+X–, in which R represents C8–C12 groups and X represents nitrate or thiocyan ate, are useful for the separation of rare earths (Preston and Du Preez 1988). Amines extr act by anion exchange. In an extraction by anion exchange, a simple inorganic anion from an ion pair type extractant, such as a quaternary ammonium salt, is replaced by a co mplex metallic anion, in reactions such as [R4N·NCS]org + [RE3+]aq + 3[NCS–]aq → [R4N·RE(NCS)4]org [R4N·NO3]org + [RE3+]aq + 3[NO3]–→ [R4N·RE(NO3)4]org The extraction of different rare earths in the thiocyanate and in the nitrate systems exhibit interesting results. This is shown in Figure 3.33. In the thiocyanate system, the extraction of a rare earth increases within its atomic number. In the nitrate system, on the other hand, the extraction decreases with an increase in atomic number. Preston and Du Preez (1990) have attributed this behavior to th e interplay of electrostatic and steric effects Figure 3.32 Extraction of trivalent lanthanides an d yttrium from nitrate media by 2.0 M TBP in toluene at 20°C. Aqueous phases 0.01 M metal nitrates in 1 M HNO3/2 M NH4NO3 (lower curve) and 1 M HNO3/5 M NH4NO3 (upper curve) (Preston and Du Preez 1990; McGill 1993). 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 177 in the stability of the various complexes, and hence their extractability. The extraction behavior of yttrium is particularly important. In the thiocyanate system, yttrium behaves as a light rare earth lying between neodymium an d samarium. In the nitrate system, on the other hand, yttrium behaves like a heavy rare earth lying between thulium and ytterbium. This indicates the possibility of separation of the yttrium in thiocyanate media from the fraction containing dysprosium, holmium, and er bium to which it reports in extraction with organophosphorus acids (Preston and Du Preez 1990). The separation factors for extraction with the typical anion exchange extractant, A liquat 336, is compared with the values for extractions with HDEHP and EHEHPA in Table 3.8. A large number of metal ions in the form of anionic complexes are extracted by long chain amines. For rare earth elements, ho wever, primary and secondary amines are relatively weak extractants and need high co ncentrations of salts and acids for a useful separation effect. These amines preferentially extract rare earth sulfates and their poor selectivity is enhanced by the presence of EDTA and DTPA. In any case, these extractions are strongly dependent on pH and concentratio n and are difficult to control (McGill 1993). Tertiary amines are also poor extractants. Synergistic effects The distribution coefficient can be considerably more than the sum of the distribution coefficients of indivi dual extraction agents when the mixture of extractants is used. Such systems commonly us ed in many metal extraction operations have not been developed to levels of industrial application for rare earth extractions (McGill 1993). Industrial processes Rare earth producers all over the world follow almost identical routes for solvent extraction separation of ra re earths. Mixer settler assemblies involving hundreds of stages of mixing are the standard contacting equipment. These routes are based on the following overall scheme: (i) separation of rare earth generally in trivalent state, (ii) ooo Figure 3.33 Extraction of trivalent lanthanides and yttrium (0.02 M as nitrates) from 4.0 M NaNO3 by 0.5 M solutions of Aliquat 336 nitr ate in xylene at 20°C and from 2.0 M KNCS by 0.25 M solutions of Aliquat 336 thiocy anate in toluene at 30°C (Preston and Du Preez 1990). 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 178 fractionation of the rare earths into three or four groups, (iii) pr eferential separation of yttrium, (iv) selective extraction of cerium and europium using their valence states Ce4+ and Eu2+, and (v) separation of the desired indi vidual rare earth of required purity. For a solvent extraction system to be attr active for industrial application, there are several relevant factors (McGill 1993). The choice of the extractant and aqueous phase may be influenced by cost considerations of all the chemicals involved. In the extraction of rare earth salts by neutral extraction media or when the rare earths are extracted as an anionic complex, the reactive chemicals requirement is less. When the rare earths are extracted using cationic complexes, the reactive chemi cals requirement is more because a base is required for extraction from the aqueous phase an d an acid is required for selective washing and reextraction from the organic phase. In ot her words cationic extraction is considerably more expensive than anionic or neutral extrac tion. Cationic extraction is, however, charac- terized by high selectivity and is preferred when this characteristic is of major importance. The first step in industrial solvent extractio n is usually the separation of the rare earth elements from other elements. A solvent whose distribution coefficient for the rare earth elements as a group is markedly different fro m that of the other element in the aqueous solution (leach liquor) is chosen. HDEHP is a suita ble extractant for this. This extractant is also suitable for concentrating the rare earth elements because of its high extraction ability for the rare earth elements, which enables it to extract them from dilute and often acidic solutions. A classic example for the industrial solvent extraction in rare earths processing is the Molycorp process for the production of europium.

At the end of physical beneficiation and chemical treatment procedur es, a chloride solution (100 g REO/L and 200 mg Eu2O3/L) containing all the rare earths (excep t Ce) originally contained in the ore is obtained. This solution is clarified, pH ad justed to 1.0 with soda ash, steam heated to 60°C, clarified again, and put throug h to the europium recovery circuit. The chloride solution described in th e previous paragraph contains 0.2 g Eu2O3 per liter. The solvent is 10% HDEHP in kerosene and the extraction is performed in 5 mixer settler stages. More than 98% of europium in the solution is extracted. The loaded organic is stripped with 4 M HCl. Th e strip solution, which contains 10 to 20 grams europium per liter, also contains iron as an impurity and this is precipitated out with soda ash at pH 3.5. Following iron removal, the Eu-bearing solution is subjected to a second solvent extraction with HDEHP in five mixer settler stages. This second extraction further purifies europium and the light rare earth fraction is left in th e raffinate, which is reverted to the first SX circuit. Europium loaded in the organic is stripped with 5 M HCl. The aqueous strip solution is passed through a column of zinc amalgam to reduce Eu(III) to Eu(II). Sulfuric acid is added to the divalent europium solutio n to precipitate europium sulfate. Reduction and selective precipitation purifies europium from the heavy rare earths. More than 99.99% pure Eu2O3 is obtained by calcination. In the second SX circuit, along with euro pium, other heavy rare earths are loaded in the organic. After europium removal, the stri p solution still contains samarium, the heavy rare earths, and yttrium. Gadolinium is ex tracted from the europium barren solution by HDEHP in a 10-stage extraction circuit followed by 5 stages of stripping. The raffinate is Figure 3.34 Molycorp process for europium oxide. 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 180 neutralized with soda ash to precipitate sama rium and the heavy rare earths.

Molycorp rare earth processing facilities at Louviers, Colorado, produce Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Tb, Lu, and Y. The Molycorp process for the preparation of pure yttrium oxide is shown in Figure 3.35. Starting from a concentrate containing 52% Y2O3 in the REO mixture, pure yttrium is produced is two consecutive cycles. The ra re earths are separated into La–Er and Y–Lu fractions by Aliquat–NO3–with recycle using Mg(NO3)2 for stripping. Yttrium is finally purified by extraction with versatic acid, including a double recycle. Denison Mines The recovery of rare earths from sulfate solutions resulting from uranium processing at Denison Mines, Elliot Lake, Ontario, has been done using solvent extraction with HDEHP. The flow sheet is shown in Figure 3.36 . An yttrium-rich concentrate (~60% REO) is produced from sulfuric acid solutions containing 150 mg Y2O3/L. The uranium barren solution at pH 2 from the ion exchange circuit is treated with lime and air in pachuka tanks. The pH is controlled to precipitate iron, some amount of thorium and other impurities. These are removed fro m solution using thickeners, filters, and clarifiers. The clarified solution is acidified with sulfuric acid and fed to the solvent extraction circuit. The solvent used is 10–12 vol % HDEHP in kerosene with no modifier and the extraction takes place in a countercu rrent centrifugal extractor. Under extraction conditions used at present, all the rare earth s and yttrium are loaded in the organic phase. The loaded solvent is stripped with nitric acid in a centrifugal contactor. Thorium anduranium present in the aqueous solution are lo aded into the solvent together with the rare earths. The rare earths are separated from thorium and uranium during stripping.

Slaked lime is added to the solution to cons ume all the free acid. Ammonia gas was then added to the solution to precipitate yttrium and other rare earths. The dried precipitate contains 30–35% Y2O3 and 60–70% RE2O3 including yttrium. Indian Rare Earths The mixed rare earth chloride so lution obtained in the course of chemical treatment of monazite contains less than 1% of any of the heavy rare earths. At the Alwaye Plant of Indian Rare Earths Ltd. , solvent extraction with HDEHP was used for a quick initial concentration of the heavy rare earths and for the production of concentrates of various individual rare earths such as Sm, Eu, Gd, and Y with purities ranging from 60 to 95%. The schematic flowsheets ar e shown in Figures 3.37 and 3.38. The flowsheets outlining the Indian practice fo r the fractionation of rare earths and for the separation of Nd and Pr using PC88A are shown in Figures 3.39 to 3.41. The flowsheets for the separation and purification of Sm, Eu, Dy, and Y are given in Figures 3.42 to 3.45 (Thakur 2000). In the Indian practice (Koppiker 1990), fr om the RE chloride solution containing 200–240 g REO/L and about 0.05 M HCl, the rare earths are extracted with 1 M PC88A in kerosene. Extraction parameters are so chosen that the solvent extracts Sm and other heavy rare earths (HRE) and also yttrium, leaving th e light rare earth (LRE) in the raffinate. The extract is then selectively scrubbed with 3 M HCl at a O/A phase ratio > 20 to remove the LRE. From the scrubbed loaded solvent, Sm , Eu, and Gd (MREs) are selectively stripped with 1–1.5 M HCl. The extract, presently contai ning only the HREs is then stripped with 3.5 M HCl.

The Eu free solution, now containing all Sm and Gd is put through one more cycle of solvent extraction with PC88A or HDEHP as extractant to produce > 95% pure Sm2O3 and 80–90% pure Gd2O3. The HRE fraction assaying around 60% Y2O3 and 15% Dy2O3 is treated further to obtain 93% Y2O3 in the first cycle of a two-cycle so lvent extraction process.

The solvent is 1.0 M PC88A in kerosene. The loaded solvent/extract is scrubbed with dilute HCl in six stages. Yttrium and HREs prefer- entially extracted by the solvent are finally stripped with strong HCl in four stages at a high phase ratio. The final strip solution would assay about 40 g REO/L (93% Y2O3) and about 1.0 M HCl. This solution is neutralized with NH4OH to a pH of 4.0 and NH4CNS is added to make it 1 M NH4CNS. The solution is put through the second cycl e of solvent extraction with 50% TBP in kerosene. The treatment is d one in 16–18 stages of extraction and 18–20 stages of scrubbing with water, and eight stages of final stripping of the loaded extract with water. All REs other than Y are preferentially extracted by TBP leaving Y in the aqueous raffinate as high purity product at above 90 % recovery. The final strip solution containing HRE would assay about 50% Er2O3 and forms the source for further separation of Er2O3. In the Indian practice, the 60% Y2O3 concentrate upgraded to 93% Y2O3 by PC88A extraction is also purified further to obtain 99.99% Y2O3 by extraction using the Aliquat 336–thiocyanate system in a chloride medium.

By leaching the cake with hydrochloric acid at pH 3.0, the bulk of the rare earths are preferentially removed and separated as mixed rare earth chloride. The slurry after removal of the major portion of ra re earths contains all the thorium and uranium present in the monazite feed. In addition, this slurry also contains substantial quantities of rare earths. This rare earth content is reco vered by solvent extraction using PC88A as the extractant. The flowsheet is shown in Figure 3.46 (Narayanan et al. 1988). The RE–Th slurry obtained after decantation of RECl3 solution is dissolved in HCl and after clarification, its acidity is adjusted to 1.5 M. The aqueous feed solutio n is contacted in the extraction circuit with the solvent PC88A (Ion quest-801) in two stages. During this step uranium and all the thorium in the aqueous f eed solution are completely picked up by the extractant leaving only the trivalent rare earth s in the aqueous phase. Thorium and uranium are recovered separately from the loaded solvent, and the rare earths are recovered from theraffinate. Mintek Solvent extraction has been used for recovering rare earths from rare earth carrying calcium sulfate sludge obtained in the manufacture of phosphoric acid from Phale- borwa apatite in South Africa (Preston et al. 1996, 1996a). The processing involved extensive application of solvent extractio n using TBP, HDEHP, and Aliquat 336 in obtaining first a mixed rare earth oxide concen trate, as shown in Figure 3.47, followed by separation of this mixed oxide into heavy, midd le, and light fractions as well as preparation of pure cerium, europium, and neo- dymium oxides (Preston 1996). Figure 3.45 Flowsheet of the four exit solvent extraction process for the simultaneous purification of dysprosium, terbium, gadolinium and yttrium using PC88A. 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 187 As mentioned earlier, the rare earth values we re leached from the sludge by dilute nitric acid and calcium nitrate. From the leach liquor , the rare earths were recovered by solvent extraction using 33 vol % dibutyl-butyl-phosp honate (DBBP) in Shellsol 2325. The loaded organic phase was stripped with water to yiel d a solution of mixed rare earth nitrates from which mixed rare earth oxide (98% pure) was obtained by the addition of oxalic acid and calcination of the oxalate precipitate. In la ter trials, the organic phase was changed to 40 vol % tributyl phosphate for an aqueous ra re earth bearing leach liquor containing 1 M nitric acid and 3 M calcium nitrate. The mi xed rare earth oxide obtained was 89–94% in purity and contained middle rare earths, part icularly neodymium, samarium, europium, and gadolinium in considerably higher propor tions than the commercially available mixed oxides from usual commercial rare earth resources. A solvent extraction was used for the recove ry of high purity cerium dioxide and a heavy rare earth oxide concentrate from the mi xed rare earth oxide. The mixed oxide was dissolved in concentrated nitric acid to yiel d solutions in which up to 95% of the cerium was present as Ce(IV). From this solution, after dilution with wate r, Ce(IV) was extracted with high selectivity into a 15 vol% solution of TBP in Shellsol K in four extraction stages. After four stages of scrubbing with 3 M nitr ic acid, stripping of the organic phase was accomplished by reduction of Ce (IV) to Ce(III) with dilute H2O2 in two stages. Oxalic acid was added to the strip solution and the oxa late precipitated was calcined to 99.8% pure cerium dioxide, which was obtained in about 70% yield. The raffinate from the cerium recovery circui t was extracted with 5 vol % solution of HDEHP in Shellsol AB in six st ages followed by stripping in four stages to give strip Figure 3.46 Process for the separation of rare earths, thorium and uranium by solvent extraction using 2-ethyl hexyl phosphonic aci d mono 2-ethyl hexyl ester (Ionquest-801) (Narayanan et al . 1988). 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 188 liquors, which on oxalate precipitation and calcination yielded mixed heavy rare earth oxide (99.4–99.8% REO). This contained 41–63% Y2O3, 17–31% Dy2O3, 4% HoO3, 4–5% Er2O3 together with smaller amou nts of other rare earths. The raffinate from heavy rare earth extract ion was processed for the separation of middle and light rare earth fractions. The processing consisted of extraction into a 15 wt %solution of HDEHP in Shellsol AB in eight countercurrent stages, followed by scrubbing with 1 M nitric acid in two to four stages an d stripping with 1.5 M hydrochloric acid in six to eight stages. Addition of oxalic acid to the strip liquors, and calcination of the precipitated oxalate yielded mixed middle rare earth oxide product containing 45% Sm 2O3, 29% Gd2O3, 13% Eu2O3, and 6% Nd2O3. From the remaining light rare earth nitrate liquor containing Nd, Pr, Ce, and La, 0.50 M solution of Aliquat 336 nitrate (tricaprylmethyl ammonium nitrate) in Shellsol AB was used to selectively extract La, Ce and Pr in two extraction circuits. Purified neodymium solution was remaining as raffinate. Extraction was carri ed out in eight extraction and six scrubbing stages. Loaded solvent was stripped with wa ter in six stages. From the solutions thus obtained, rare earth oxides were obtained by oxalate precipitation and calcination. From the raffinate, 75% of neodymium present in the or iginal feed was obtained as 95–96% pure (magnet grade) Nd2O3. The impurities were 2% Pr6O11, 1.5% Sm2O3, 0.7% CeO3, and 0.2% La2O3. From the first circuit strip liq uor, lanthanum concentrate (51% La2O3, 36% CeO2, 7% Pr6O11, and 6% Nd2O3) and from second circuit strip liquor, praseodymium concentrate (32% Pr6O11, 41% Nd2O3, 22% CeO2, and 4% La2O3) were obtained. Megon The Megon Company in Norway, founded in 1969, processes xenotime to recover yttrium concentrate and high purity yttrium oxide. The flowsheet is shown in Figure 3.47 Schematic diagram of the pilot plant leaching and solvent extraction circuits for rare earth recovery from Phalaborwa apatite source (Preston 1996). 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 189 Figure 3.48. There are three extraction cycl es (Ritcey and Ashbrook 1979, McGill 1993). From the rare earth sulfate solution obtained after chemical treatment of xenotime concen- trate, a 30% solution of HDEHP in Shellsol T diluent is used to achieve an intermediate type of separation. In four mixer settler st ages, some Nd, and all the heavier rare earths including yttrium are extracted while La, Ce, and Pr remain in the raffinate. Stripping the extract with 1.5 N HNO3 in four stages removes the Nd–Tb fraction, which includes large amounts of samarium and gadolinium. Stripping the extract with 6 N HNO3 in eight stages of mixer settlers removes yttrium with most of the heavy lanthanides. Ytterbium and lutetium are only partially stripped by HNO3. They are, however, removed in a single stage with 10% NaOH. Instead of 10% NaOH, either 20% HF or 50% H2SO4 could also be used for an equally effective stripping. The caustic treatment also removes any Fe or Th present. The solvent phase is acidified with su lfuric acid and reverted to extraction. The concentrated yttrium nitrate solutio n obtained by stripping with 6 N HNO3 is processed further to high purity in many st ages of extraction using the quaternary ammon- ium compound Aliquat 336. The separation of hi gh purity yttrium is based, quite obviously, on the different extraction behavior of yttriu m in nitrate and thiocyanate systems. Using 43% quaternary ammonium nitrate (nitrate of tricapryl-methylamine) in Solvesso 250, the lighter rare earths Gd–Er are extracted leaving yttrium in the raffinate along with thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium. The yttrium content of this rare earth mixture is 95%. Ammonium thiocyanate was added to this raffinate and using quaternary ammonium thiocyanate (tri- capryl-methyl-ammonium-thiocyanate) in Solvesso 150, the rare earths Tm, Yb, Lu wereextracted leaving yttrium in the raffinate. Yttr ium is recovered from the raffinate by direct precipitation with oxalic acid and calcination to an oxide product. To enhance the purity of the yttrium product further, an additional solven t extraction stage is also carried out (mainly Figure 3.48 AS Megon process for high purity yttrium oxide (McGill 1997). 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 190 to separate yttrium from non-rare earth impu rities) ahead of the precipitation. From an aqueous solution containing ammonium thiocyan ate, yttrium is extr acted into the SCN form of Adogen 464. Yttrium is stripped from the solvent by water, and from the strip solution yttrium is precipitated as oxalat e. The above process has been used by MCI–Megon, Norway for commercial production of 99.995% purity Y2O3. In addition to Aliquat 336, the solvent Adogen 464 in Solves so 100 has also been used as the extractant (Ritcey and Ashbrook 1979) by Megon. Rhône-Poulenc In Rhône-Poulenc all the rare earth elements with purities of >99.999% are produced almost entirely by solvent extraction. For certain rare earth elements, separation by solvent extraction alon e would turn out to be very expensive. They are still produced in kilogram quantities by ion exchange. Th e outline of the Rhône-Poulenc separation scheme is shown in Figure 3.49 (McGill 1993). Monazite, which is the source mineral, is digested with NaOH, and from the mixed RE–Th hydroxide obtained after trisodium phosphate separation, a rare earth chloride solution and a rare earth nitrat e solution are produced. The unwanted elements are removed from each of these solutions. The solvent extract ion stream in the chloride medium yielded nonseparated rare earth compounds, such as dehydrated rare earth chlorides, which are useful for electrolysis to misch metal. The so lvent extraction stream in the nitrate medium is used to yield separated rare earth oxides. Lanthanum (99.995% La2O5) is left in the aqueous phase while the mixture of Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Y etc., goes into theorganic phase. Similarly CeO 2 (99.5%) is separated in the Nd–Sm stream. After primary Ce removal, following the sequence shown in the figure, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, and Yoxides are recovered. The purification and isolat ion of individual rare earths is carried out Figure 3.49 Rhône-Poulenc solvent extraction proces s for the separation of rare earth elements (McGill 1993). 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 191 in a variety of extractants that include aci dic and neutral organophosphorus compounds, amines, and carboxylic acids. The solvent extraction separation of each ra re earth element is carried out in multi- stage batteries of mixer settlers. At least 50 mixture settler stages per stream are needed to obtain a product with four to 99.9999% purity. Rhône-Poulenc produces high purity separated rare earth oxides starting from not only monazite, but also from bastnasite or euxe nite. The Rhône-Poulen c solvent extraction flowsheet has been regarded as the standard for all industrial producers (Bautista 1995). Thorium Ltd. In the erstwhile practice at Thor ium Ltd. in the U.K., a bastnasite concentrate was processed first by leaching th e rare earth carbonates by HCl followed by caustic treatment of the leached concentrate, to break the fluoride bond. The rare earth hydroxides thus obtained were then leached with HCl. The mixed rare earths chloride solution was processed by solven t extraction. First, the rare earths samarium to yttrium were extracted by an unnamed extractant, and europium was reduced to the divalent state and recovered (Ritcey and Ashbrook 1979). Subsequently, gadolinium, samarium, and yttrium were recovered in a separate process. The raffinate contained La, Ce, Pr, and Nd. Sodium hypochlorite was used to ox idize Ce in the raffinate to Ce4+ which precipitated as cerium hydroxide on the addition of ammonia. The solution, containing La, Pr and Nd, was precipitated with sodium carbonate and the precipitate was redissovled in nitric acid. Thorium Ltd. used TBP as extractant for th e separation of individual rare earths from the nitrate solution. The process was a batch extraction in which equilibrium was attained by a total recycle on the extraction stages as well as total recycle on the scrubbing stages until the desired solutes had been concentrated . Water was used to strip the rare earths from the loaded solvent and from the strip liquor. Th e rare earths were precipitated as hydroxides or carbonates. The precipitates were dissolv ed once again in acid and the solution was recycled. Even though this process finally yi elded the desired product purity, it is costly relative to a continuous process and is also no t attractive for use in large plant installations. For the extraction and separati on of yttrium, Thorium Ltd. used Versatic 911. They developed the technique of total recycle in two consecutive systems. The first was a 25-stage process operated with versatic acid and the second was a 50-stage process operated with TBP as the extractant. By these, Y2O3 of 99.999% purity was obtained starting from a 47% Y2O3 concentrate (Brown and She rrington 1979, McGill 1993). Yao Lung chemical plant The Yao Lung chemical plant in Shanghai was the first of the rare earth processing plants in China. It went into production in 1964 and operates a similar process for the digestion of monazite as Rhône-Poulenc. The simplified flowsheet of this plant for extraction and separation of rare earth oxides from monazite (Zhang et al . 1982) is given in Figure 3.50. A flowsheet for the simultaneous purificati on of yttrium and other heavy rare earths is shown in Figure 3.51. This flowsheet, believed to be used in Japan for commercial pro- duction (Thakur 2000), comprises solvent extract ion operations with versatic acid, PC88A and TBP. 3.6 SCANDIUM Solvent extraction has been the process used fo r the recovery and isolation of scandium from its resources, which are essentially non-rare ear th minerals. In the processing of uranium,03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 192 during solvent extraction, scandium is extract ed and concentrated together with uranium. In the subsequent purification of the uranium, the scandium is separated. Three processes for accomplishing this separation and recovery of 99% pure scandium have been reviewed by Gschneidner (1975). In the processes likely to be used for large scale, high purity scan- dium recovery from wolframite use solvent extraction for separation. The processes em- ployed for opening thortveit ite use chlorination (Iya 1953, Vickery 1955) or fluorination (Spedding et al. 1958) to obtain a scandium-ri ch material which is subsequently dissolved and the scandium recovered in pure form by using ion exchange and solvent extraction. 3.7 SUMMARY The by-product status of one of the two principal minerals of rare earths, monazite, carries it through the processing steps from as-mined condition to the status of a mineral concen- trate. Even though monazite mining and proces sing are carried out in different parts of the world, the processes applied for beneficiating the mineral are essentially the same: gravity, electrostatic and electromagnetic separations a nd flotation. For beneficiating the bastnasite ore from Mountain Pass and the iron–rare eart h–niobium ore from Bayan Obo, flotation is the key process and it works. Both acid and al kali digestion methods have been applied to monazite processing and the alkali treatment technique that yields trisodium phosphate by-product is used commercially. Chemical trea tment of bastnasite is less extensive. Usually the processes applied for chemical attack of mo nazite and bastnasite or their minor variations work well on the remaining resources such as xenotime, gadolinite, and euexenite. As far Figure 3.50 Simplified flowsheet of Yao Lu ng chemical plant (Zhang et al . 1982). 03 Chapter 3 133-19 4.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:43 PMRESOURCE PROCESSING 193 as chemical treatment of rare earth resources is concerned, direct chlorination in the presence of carbon has been the widely effective technique with every type of mineral. The celebrated chemical similarity of the rare earth elements has a built-in bug in the slow and steady change in basicity, as the el ements lanthanum to lutetium and yttrium are considered. This difference has been explo ited directly and indirectly in devising procedures for separating rare earths from on e another, both by the classical methods of fractional crystallization and fractional precipit ation and also by the modern methods of ion exchange and solvent extraction. Exploitation of multivalency, particularly in cerium and europium, is obvious from the basis of meth ods for effecting their separation. These techniques have remained timele ss and continue to be used even in current procedures as part of the overall technique of separation either preceding or following ion exchange or solvent extraction. Both ion exchange and solven t extraction rely on the availability of suit- able complexing agents and solvents, resp ectively. EDTA and HEDTA are the mainstay for ion exchange. In solvent extraction TBP, DEHPA, PC88A, versatic acid and Aliquat 336 have been very useful. Among the two modern separation techniqu es, ion exchange and solvent extraction, solvent extraction has the advantages that it is fast, continuous, and works on more concen- trated solutions, and it is economical for ha ndling large quantities of materials. Ion exchange is, however, regarded as superior fo r the production of extremely pure materials. However, commercial production of materials at 99.9% or even 99.99% purity with solvent extraction has been possible (Bautista 1995). Although the details of actual procedures, sequence of various operations, and identities of certain organic solvents are usually not disclosed in publications, the solvent extractio n technology has been expanded in the three decades starting from the mid-1960s to commercial scale separation/ purification of at least 11 of the 15 rare earths that occur in bast nasite, monazite, and xenotime ores. Solvent extraction would not be the method of choice in at least two instances: (1) when product purity exceeding 99.9% is required, and (2) wh en the lesser abundant rare earths such as Tm, Yb, and Lu are to be isolated in a commercial solvent extraction circuit.

They are therefore the natural starting material for conversion to metal by reduction. These oxides are extremely stable and their reduction to metal is, therefore, very difficult. The difficulties in reduction are usually compounded but occasionally alleviated by the physical properties such as the melting point and vapor pr essure of the rare earth metals. Conversion of the rare earth oxide to a rare earth halide and reduction of the halide to the metal is a useful procedure because of certain inherent characteristics of the halide reduction processes. Fused salt electrolysis as applied to the production of reactive metals also holds relevance for rare earth metals preparation. Th e relatively low melting point of many of the rare earth metals is an advantage here. The preparation of rare earth metals by a method inwhich an alloy is prepared first and the metal is then recovered from the alloy is another interesting possibility. In this route both chem ical and electrolyte methods of reduction may be used. Every method of rare earth metal preparation has certain advantages and limitations with respect to applicability to individual rare earths, purity of product, yield of the metal, batch size, operational convenience, and eco nomy. In spite of their celebrated chemical similarity in their trivalent states, the rare earths do display considerable variation in properties like melting point and vapor pressure . This variation largely comes in the way of applying certain reduction methods unifor mly for the preparation of all the rare earth metals. Another factor is the possibility of a stable divalency in some of the rare earth elements. This frustrates attemp ts to produce them by the us ual chemical or electrolytic reduction processes. Special processes, however, circumvent the limitation. 4.2 FUNDAMENTALS The process of liberation of a metal from its co mpound or “reduction” is represented by the following general reaction: .04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 196 MXn + iR = M + iRXn/i (1) where M is the metal to be obtained; X is oxygen, fluorine, or chlorine; and R is the reducing element which, in general, may be hyd rogen, carbon, or metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, or alum inum, in most of the cases. It is funda- mental knowledge that metallurgical thermody namics provides the answer to the question if reaction (1) can occur at all. The reaction is possible only when at a chosen reaction temperature the difference between the free energies of formation, ∆G, of the starting compound, MXn, and the corresponding compound of the reductant element, RXn/a, is negative. In other words, if the condition i∆G(RXn/i) – ∆G(MXn) < 0 (2) is satisfied. Therefore the free energies of formation of the metal as well as reductant oxides, fluorides, and chlorides, and their dependence on temperature determine which element can function as R for a given compound MXn to release the metal M. The data on the free energies of formation of compounds were presented as straight line plots with tem-perature as abscissa and standard free energy of formation as ordinate first by Ellingham (1944) and later by Richardson and Jeffes (1 948). The Ellingham diagrams of compounds relevant to the reduction of rare earths are given in Figures 4.1 to 4.5. Data from the U.S. Bureau of Mines Publications (Pankratz et al . 1984) have been used in preparing these diagrams. Even as the first approximation, the number of elements that can function as reducing agents for the rare earths is very limited. Un der standard conditions, the order of stability Figure 4.1 Standard free energy of formation of rare earth oxides as a function of temperature.04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 197 among the oxides is CaO > RE2O3 > MgO > Al2O3 >> SiO2. The situation is similar among the fluorides. Here again, the order of stability is CaF2 > REF3 > LiF > NaF > MgF2 > AlF3.

Thus under standard conditio ns, which in effect means MXn, R, M, and RXn/i given Figure 4.4 Standard free energy of formation of selected chlorides of rare earths and certain common metals as a function of temperature. ° Figure 4.5 Standard free energy of formation of se lected fluorides of rare earths and certain common metals as a function of temperature. 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 199 in equation (1) are all pure and at one atmo sphere pressure, only calcium can reduce the rare earth oxides and fluorides. However, the chlorides can be reduced by potassium, sodium, and lithium in additio n to calcium. Among the nonmetals, hydrogen cannot reduce the rare earth chlorides at temperatures norm ally used for conventional reduction. Carbon, forming carbon monoxide, can reduce the ra re earth oxide at high temperatures. The picture under nonstandard conditions that, more often than not, more closely approximates the real reduction process condit ion is somewhat different. Here the reaction mixture need not be composed of only pure constituents MXn, R, M and RXn/i under 1 atmosphere pressure. In other words, the activity, a, of each of the constituents, aR, etc., need not be kept equal to 1. The use of conditions where aR etc., of one or more of the components is made less than 1 alters the value of the free energy of the reaction and creates a more favorable environment for the reaction to proceed. The typical methods to effect the activity change are the formation of a produc t metal having a low boiling point and hence vaporizing in the metallothermic reaction ( pM < 1 atm and aM < 1), recovery of the reduced metal as an alloy ( aM < 1), and trapping the compound formed by the reductant in a complex slag ( aRXn/i < 1). It may also be mentioned here that carbothermic reduction under vacuum, which makes pCO << 1 (or aCO << 1) becomes an efficient method of reduction at high temperatures. Even after circumventing th e reaction feasibility factor by tailoring the reaction component activities, there are other considerations that influence the practical implementation of the reduction process. In rare earth metal preparation, the choice of reducing agents being mainly confined to me tals, certain factors relating to the practic- ability of metallothermic reductions merit consideration. 4.3 METALLOTHERMY The metallothermic reduction reaction may be generally represented by the equation M(I) Xn + iM(II) = M(I) + iM(II)Xn/i where M(I) is the metal to be produced, X is the anion, and i, n are the stoichiometric coefficients. While the feasibility of the meta llothermic process is determined by the free energies of formation of the compounds involv ed in the above reaction, the practicability of the metallothermic reduction is determined by several other properties such as melting point, boiling point, vapor pressure, density, viscosity (for liquid components), and charac- teristics such as chemical reactivity and al loying behavior of the various participants (reactants and products) of the reaction. The co mputation of the standard free energy of the reaction, therefore, presents only a limited picture on the reaction practicability. A more complete picture is obtained by consider ing the various properties of the reaction participants listed above. The desirable characteristics of the meta llothermic reduction have been summarized by Herget (1985) as: (i) the reaction should occur quickly and give product metal in high yields, (ii) the reaction products must be obt ained in compact forms — metal as an ingot and the slag as a well-separated layer, (iii) the reaction should be self-sustaining and once initiated should proceed without the need for additional external heating, (iv) the product metal must be of high purity, (v) the reactio n proceeds in an open atmosphere, (vi) the04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 200 reaction should proceed safely without risk, and (vii) the reaction should be amenable to being carried out in commercially available r eactors using readily available refractories as containers. Metallothermic reductions are generally exothermic reactions, and by a suitable choice of reactants, materials, and process c onditions it has been possible to realize many of the characteristics listed above and ob tain the metal from its compound. The use of reactants in a powder or particulate form favo rs better reagent contact and, once initiated, a quicker reaction. If the heat generated duri ng the reaction is sufficient to raise the temperature of both slag and metal to above th eir melting points, and if they remain molten for a sufficient length of time, so that the mo lten metal (denser) settles by gravity with the immiscible slag layer (lighter) remaining on its top, a metal ingot topped by a solidified slag results on cooling. Slag and metal are then separable by mechanical means. When the heat of reaction is insufficient to re sult in an all liquid reaction mixture, other types of products can form. If the reduction occurs but the slag do es not melt, the metal is formed as a powder dispersed in the slag matrix. The slag in this case is leached away to separate the metal powder. Metal in the form of powder can result even if the slag melts if the melting point of the metal is very high and the metal is no t sintered at the temperatures involved. When the reduction to metal occurs with only the slag melting, but not the metal, the metal particles usually coalesce and undergo partial consolidation into what is called a sponge. Here the metal and sponge are separated either by aqueous leaching or by vacuum distillation. By a suitable choice of reductants, reactor s, and reaction conditions, the metal can usually be obtained in the chosen form. Th e rare earth metals have been prepared by metallothermic reduction in the form of an in got, sponge, or powder. Metal ingot has been prepared usually by metallothermic reduction of rare earth fluorides as well as some of the rare earth chlorides using calcium as reductant. Rare earth metal in the form of sponge has been obtained from the chloride using lithium as the reductant. Rare earth metal powder has been directly obtained by reducing rare earth oxide with calcium. Instead of the elemental metal product certain rare earth alloys can al so be directly prepared in ingot, sponge, or powder form. Metal is subsequently obtained from the alloy by distillation in vacuum. In the earliest successful attempt on rare earth metal preparation, metallothermic reduction was used and this tec hnique, to date, remains the mo st widely used. The purity of the metallothermic reduction product depends, among other things, on the purity of the starting materials, pure oxides, anhydrous chlo rides and fluorides, and that of reductants. While the purity of rare earth oxides is essent ially determined by the separation step, the purities of chlorides and fluorides are dete rmined by the method of their preparation, usually starting from the oxides. 4.4 PREPARATION OF RARE EARTH CHLORIDES The preparation of rare earth chlorides for use as intermediate for reduction to metal has been accomplished by two routes (Block a nd Campbell 1961). One, known as the wet route, involves dehydration of hydrated rare ear th chloride and in the other, the dry route, the oxide is directly converted to anhydrous chloride.04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 201 4.4.1 Preparation of Hydrated Rare Earth ChlorideThe basic procedure was described by Spedding et al. (1952). The rare earth oxide was dissolved in hydrochloric acid and the solution was evaporated to a syrup, which boiled at 128°C. This solution was then poured into a large porcelain disc and stirred while it cooled forming the hydrated chloride crystals. Spedding and Daane (1952) also prepared hydrated cerium chloride by dissolving ce- rium ammonium nitrate in 6N hydrochloric acid and evaporating the resulting solution to a boiling point of 125–130°C. On coolin g, the hydrated chlorides crystallized. Nolting et al. (1960) prepared yttrium chlori de by digesting yttrium oxide in concen- trated hydrochloric acid and by evaporating the solvent until the yttrium chloride hexa- hydrate crystallized. Mixed hydrated rare earth chloride was prod uced in the past (Hirschhorn 1967) by wet chemical treatment of bastnasite and monazite. The process used for bastnasite at the York, PA, plant of Molycorp (Kruesi and Du ker 1965) was described in Chapter 3. 4.4.2 Dehydration of Hydrated Rare Earth ChloridesAn old and popular method for the preparatio n of anhydrous rare earth chlorides involves dehydration of the hydrated chloride under an atmosphere of dry HCl (Kleirheksal and Kremers 1928). Dehydration invo lves heating the hydrated ch loride, and in many of the investigations (Block and Camp bell 1961) it has been reported that the temperature should be below the melting point of partially dehydr ated chloride to prevent it from reacting with the liberated water and forming oxychlorides . Harrison (1952), however, has observed that in the final stages of dehydration, temperat ures above the melting point are necessary to prepare rare earth chlorides free of oxychlor ides. An increase in dehydration temperature can result in quicker dehydration. While seve ral days are required to dehydrate a single batch of chloride when the temperature is kept at well below 100°C, complete dehydrationcould be affected in half a day if the hydrat es were slowly heated to 250°C under a reduced pressure of approximately 3 kPa. During de hydration a small flow of HCl is maintained over the salts to prevent hydrolysis. The tendency to hydrolyze appears to depe nd on the temperature and the particular rare earth chloride (Koch 1953). The stabilit y of oxychlorides increases with increase in temperature and with increase in atomic numb er. Thus heavier rare earth chlorides would be more difficult to prepare by dehydration of hydrated chlorides. The following overall procedure has been used at Ames laboratory to prepare anhydrous rare earth chlorides on a fairly large scale (Block and Campbell 1961). Rare earth oxides were dissolved in hydrochloric acid and the solution was heated to drive off uncombined water. When the solution had been heated to about 130°C and had become viscous, it was poured into an evaporating dish and was allowe d to cool. While cooling, the salt was stirred continuously to make it cr ystallize as a powder. The hydrated salt powder was then dehydrated by heating in a 75 to 100 mm diameter pyrex tube through which purified HCl was passed while the pressure was maintained at 550–650 Pa. Heating was done gradually, raising the temperature from below 80 to 400°C over a period of 10 to 30 h. The product was anhydrous rare earth trichloride free of oxychlorides. Nolting et al. (1960) prepared anhydrous yttrium chloride in an apparatus shown schematically in Figure 4.6. The hydrated ch loride was dehydrated by passing anhydrous04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 202 hydrogen chloride gas under slight positive pressure downward through the dehydrating tower containing the yttrium chloride. Star ting at 110°C hydrogen chloride was passed (~0.5 l/min) through the column for 24 h by which time no more water was collecting downstream outside the tower. The water collect ed until it then corresponded to 80% of the water of hydration of the yttrium chloride. Th e temperature was then raised to 350°C for another 24 h. Dehydrated yttrium chloride wa s removed from the tower after cooling. It was melted in a platinum crucible at 1000°C in an inert atmosphere to remove hydrogen chloride and cast into rods (25 mm diameter by 75 mm long) in a copper mold. The yield was quantitative. In another method, the hydrated chloride wa s dehydrated in the presence of an excess of ammonium chloride (Jantsch et al . 1930, 1931, Gray 1951). The temperature of the salt was gradually raised keeping it under a stream of HCl or vacuum. As the heating continued, ammonium chloride was also evolved and this helped to prevent the formation of oxy- chlorides. Block and Campbell (1961) have repo rted that better results were obtained when the hydrated salts were dehydrated in the pr esence of ammonium chloride at a very low pressure than when the hydrated salts were treated under a reduced pressure of HCl. This happens because ammonium chloride is a more effective chlorinating agent than HCl. The pressure during dehydration with ammonium chlo ride should be less than 60 Pa to minimize oxygen contamination. Such an operation, because of low ambient pressure, requires several days for completion. The followin g description given by Block and Campbell (1961) pertains to the preparation of anhy drous yttrium chloride in 20 kg batches. Yttrium oxide was slowly dissolved in concentrated hydrochloric acid and the insoluble matter was filtered out. Four moles of ammonium chloride per mole of yttrium was added to the filtrate. The solution wa s heated to evaporate water. Heating was continued until the normal boiling point of the solution reached 132°C and at this point the solution was a thick syrupy liquid. Upon cooling, this liquid solidified to a crystalline mass Figure 4.6 Setup for dehydrating yttrium ch loride (Nolting et al. 1960). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 203 containing a mixture of ammonium chloride and hydrated yttrium chloride. This salt was dehydrated in a nickel vacuum retort (Block et al . 1960) shown in Figure 4.7. The hydrated salt was loaded into a series of circular nickel trays to a depth of about 50 mm. Initially the retort was evacuated with a water aspirator and heated to 100–120°C. The bulk of the water was thus removed. Af ter reaching 120°C and after the evolution of water had stopped, the valve to the aspirator was closed and the retort was connected to a rotary vacuum pump. A dry ice–acetone cold trap between the retort and the pump collected the water. The temperature of the reto rt was raised slowly to 350°C in such a way that the pressure within the retort remained at 3 to 70 Pa. During th is operation, whatever water remained in the hydrated salt was re moved and collected in the cold trap, and ammonium chloride was sublimed and collect ed by condensation on the water-cooled coils suspended from the top flange of the retort. Si x to seven days of operation were required to handle a charge of 20 kgs, and 95 to 98% of yttrium originally present in the yttria was converted to anhydrous yttrium chloride. Croat (1969) used the apparatus shown in Figure 4.8 for vacuum dehydration of a mixture of NH4Cl and the hydrated rare earth trichl oride. This apparatus consisted of an inconel furnace tube or retort (130 mm in diam eter and 915 mm in leng th) in series with a dry ice and acetone trap and a pumping system . The face plate of the retort contained a water-cooled cold finger made of inco nel for freezing out part of the NH4Cl. The chloride was contained in a platinum boat with a loose fitting lid. Croat (1969) used this apparatus to prepare anhydrous chlorides of dyspro sium, holmium, and erbium. The hydrated chlorides were heated for 4 h at 90°C while evac uating the retort with a water aspirator. The bulk of the uncombined water was thus remove d. The charge was then gradually heated to 335°C while evacuating to 1 Pa . The bulk of the removed NH4Cl was collected on the water-cooled cold finger. The anhydrous chlo rides were vacuum cast in the apparatus Figure 4.7 Yttrium chloride dehydration assembly (Block et al. 1960). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 204 shown schematically in Figure 4.9. In th e 62 mm diameter and 250 mm long tantalum crucible, approximately 600 g of the anhydrou s chloride could be vacuum cast. The 6 mm tantalum tube extending upward from the botto m of the crucible was useful for venting volatile products during the casting process. Th e crucible lid made of a tantalum sheet was welded in place after the chlorides were loaded with the crucible. The chlorides were heated slowly under 0.001 Pa to approximately 100°C higher than their melting point and held for a few minutes only. The loss of chlorides by volatilization was negligible because the chloride vapor pressure at vacuum casting temperatures was less than about 10 Pa. In a recent investigation, Ch ambers and Murphy (1988) used a glass-lined reactor, shown in Figure 4.10, for dehydration of neod ymium chloride hexahydrate in a vacuum in the presence of ammonium chloride. Hirschhorn (1967) has summarized the meth ods for dehydrating hydrated rare earth chloride as used industrially in the 1940s. Th e hydrated chloride obtained by wet chemical treatment of monazite or bastnasite contained about 30% H2O. It was dehydrated using methods that minimize oxidation or hydrolysis . The technique typically included heating in vacuum or heating in air with the admixt ure of a salt, to reduce hydrolysis. The Auer- gesellschaft in Berlin used a rotary iron v acuum drum drier, steam heated to 350°C at a vacuum of 90 kPa. The product had an oxychloride content of 1.5%. In Bavaria, Prometheus used a process involving heating a mixture of rare earth chloride with CaCl2 in air for 2 to 2.5 h. The yield was typically 62%, indicating that the dehydrated chloride contained substantial amounts of oxychlorid e. Treibacher Chemische Werke of Austria used a two-stage vacuum drying process in wh ich the hydrate was heated first at 170°C and then at 350°C. While many dehydration tech niques involve the addition of ammonium chloride to reverse hydrolysis, some commerci al producers use sodium or calcium chloride to retard hydrolysis on the basis of common ion mass action effect. Figure 4.8 Schematic drawing of the apparatus for dehydrating hydrated rare earth trichloride (Croat 1969). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 205 4.4.3 Dry Methods There are many dry methods to directly prepar e anhydrous rare earth chlorides. The method reported by Reed et al . (1935, 1939) involves the solid state reaction of rare earth oxide with ammonium chloride. By heating rare earth oxide with twice the theoretically required quantity of ammonium chloride at about 19 0°C, complete conversion of the rare earth oxide to rare earth chloride occurred. Ex cess ammonium chloride was removed from the product by heating to 300–320°C under vacuum. About 85 to 95% of the rare earth present in the oxide was converted to the anhydrous chloride. Another dry method involves the use of thio nyl chloride in a sealed pressure vessel. Conversion was usually incomplete even afte r the temperature between 150 and 300°C was maintained and the treatment was cont inued for three days (Hecht et al . 1947). Other dry methods for the preparation of anhydrous rare earth trichloride involved direct reaction of the metal carbide or the ra re earth oxide–carbon mixtures with a gaseous chlorinating agent, e.g., elemental chlorine. The method of directly chlorinating the rare earth minerals–carbon mixture by chloride wa s described earlier in Chapter 3 for monazite (Hartley 1952) and bastnasite (Brugger an d Greinacher 1967). Actually, the process Figure 4.9 Apparatus for vacuum casting the anhydr ous rare earth trichlorides (Croat 1969). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 206 described for bastnasite by Brugger and Grei nacher (1967) has been used on a production scale at Th. Goldschmidt AG. This process has also been useful for chlorinating other rare earth ores like monazite, allanite, cerite, xe notime, euxenite, fergusonite, gadolinite, etc. The fused anhydrous chlorides of the rare eart hs obtained as final product are devoid of thorium chloride and any oxychloride. They ar e suitable for the production of corresponding metals. Using the same chlorinating procedure, one can convert pure rare earth oxide to the corresponding anhydrous chloride. Block and Campbell (1961) have described a method for chlorinating cerium and yttrium oxides, with a mixture of chlorine and carbon tetrachloride, in the presence of carbon. The oxides were mixed with an exce ss of carbon and a small amount of dextrin (binder) and were formed into pellets or nodu les. The nodules were loaded into a vertical quartz tube in the apparatus show n in Figure 4.11 (Block et al . 1960) and heated to 600°C in the absence of air, to decompose the dextrin. Either chlorine alone or carbon tetrachloride mixed with a small amount of chlorine was then passed up through the charge while it was heated to a temperature just below the melting point of the chloride. If the chlorides melt, they coat the unreacted particles of the ch arge. For cerium, temperatures between 750 to 800°C were found to be optimum, and for yttr ium best results were obtained at 650°C. Approximately 95% of the rare earth present as the oxide was converted to the chloride in the above procedure. The product in these pr ocedures was impure because of the presence of unreacted oxide and excess carbon and so needed a purification step. Block et al . (1960) have also used yttrium oxal ate in place of yttrium oxide–carbon mixture for chlorination. Yttrium oxalate was dr ied at 300°C for 8 h in the apparatus shown in Figure 4.11 and then was heated to 57 5°C while carbon tetrachloride was passed up Figure 4.10 Apparatus for dehydrating neodymium chloride (Chambers and Murphy 1988).04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 207 through the charge. Chlorine was used as a carrier gas to sweep the carbon tetrachloride through the tube. Overall yttrium recoveries of only 75% were obtained by this procedure. Even though no carbon remained in the produc t from the reaction, it needed to be purified to separate it from unreacted yttrium compounds. 4.4.4 Purification of Rare Earth Chlorides The major impurity in a prepared rare earth chloride is oxygen. It is present either as unconverted oxide or oxychloride. Carbon is another impurity, particularly when the chloride is prepared by a carbothermic reducti on. Vacuum distillation and filtration are the two methods used for freeing the rare earth chloride of oxygen-containing compounds, carbon, and several other impurities. Purification by distillation was accomplished by Block et al. (1960) in an apparatus shown in Figure 4.12. The raw yttrium chloride obtained after dehydration was loaded into the nickel container shown in the bottom of th e retort. The pressure inside the retort was Figure 4.11 Yttrium chlorination apparatus (Block and Campbell 1961). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 208 maintained between 5 and 50 mPa by contin uous evacuation while the lower end of the retort containing the charge was heated to between 850 and 950°C. Yttrium chloride distilled and condensed in the upper cooler regi on of the retort. Distillation lasted 72 h to collect 20 kg of yttrium chloride. The retort was then backfilled with argon and the furnace was repositioned to heat the upper section of the retort to 900°C. Heating was continued for 1 h to allow the yttrium chloride to melt and run down into the molybdenum crucible which was placed midway between the charge contai ner and condenser. Thus yttrium chloride was cast directly into the crucible, with minimum exposure to the atmosphere. Double distillation was done if an unusually large amount of impurities were present in the chloride. After the first distillation, the ch loride was chipped off the nickel condensing shield and was loaded back into the lower co ntainer. The distillation was repeated. Between 90 and 95% of yttrium chloride charged to the retort was recovered in the purified product after vacuum distillation. Figure 4.12 Yttrium chloride purification assembly (Block and Campbell 1961).04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 209 By vacuum distillation, not only the oxy gen compounds are separated from the rare earth chloride, but also the rare earth chloride powder charge is converted into a dense crystalline mass. Even though the rare earth chlorides are extremely hygroscopic, less hydration occurred when the crystalline mass was handled as it exposed considerably less surface to the atmosphere (Moriarty 1968). It is more difficult to separate carbon th an oxygen by vacuum distillation. A second distillation is usually necessary to bring down the carbon leve l to less than 0.2%. Repeated distillation is necessary if the rare earth chlo ride is grossly contaminated. Solid impurities tend to entrain in the evaporating gas str eam and are carried over to the condensate. Repeating the distillation results in their comp lete removal. As regards the overall recovery of rare earth chloride after prepar ation and purification, Block et al. (1960) noted that better recoveries (~90%) were obtained when an initial wet procedure was followed by distillation. Filtration of the molten chloride is anothe r method useful for the purification of rare earth chlorides (Block and Campbell 1961). This method was found to be especiallyeffective for the separation of carbon from yttrium chloride. The molten chloride was allowed to drain through a pad of molybdenum wool and the entire operation was carried out in an argon atmosphere. As long as there was no moistu re in the system, molybdenum or nickel containers could be used to cont ain the molten chloride. Filtration was more effective than distillation for removing gross contamination. However, if the impurities were present in lower levels, distillation was more effective. 4.5 REDUCTION OF RARE EARTH CHLORIDES 4.5.1 Early Attempts The first recorded attempt at the preparat ion of a rare earth metal is credited to C.G. Mosander (1827). As early as 1826, he reduced cerium trichloride by heating it with potassium in a stream of hydrogen to obta in cerium metal powder. The product was, how- ever, obtained in poor yields and was contam inated with excess redu ctant and reaction pro- ducts. Following Mosander, several early at tempts were made to reduce the rare earth chlorides by sodium and other alkali metals (Trombe 1957). The product obtained was in- variably a metal powder in poor yield, disperse d in alkali chloride slag. However, successful preparation of several light rare earths was reported by reduction of their chlorides with potassium and sodium vapor (Kremers 1925, Zintl and Neumayr 1933). To remove theexcess reductant and its products, the as-redu ced metal was then vacuum annealed. Klemm and Bommer (1937) produced powder metals of all the rare earths except promethium. They carried out their reduction after sealing the ra re earth trichloride with potassium in quartz ampoules to avoid atmosphere contact. The ampoules were heated at 350–400°C and the rare earth chlorides were reduced by potassiu m vapor. They succeeded in obtaining the rare earth metals as small crystals intermixed with excess potassium reductant and potassium chloride slag. Even though they never compacted their metal into an ingot, the metals were pure and they measured fairly accurate lattice constants for most of the rare earth metals. The major investigations in the metallotherm ic reduction of rare earth chlorides are summarized in Table 4.1. A powder product di spersed in slag results from insufficient heat ooo 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 210 of reaction to melt the reaction products. Product melting and better slag–metal separation can be achieved primarily by (i) the use of a booster reaction to supplement the enthalpy of the main reaction, and (ii) forming a low melt ing reaction product such as the alloy and a multicomponent low melting slag. Cerium, ne odymium, and gadolinium were obtained by reduction of their trichlorides with magnesiu m. As a result, a magnesium rare earth alloy was obtained. On removal of magnesium by v acuum distillation, rare earth metals with purities of 99.5–99.8% were obtained. Following the earlier work of Moldenhauer (1914) and Karl (1934) calcium was also used to reduce cerium trichloride. Calcium in dolomite-lined steel bombs was used to reduce cerium trichloride securing kilogram levels of production of cerium metal. Here,additional heat necessary to melt and hence separate the reaction products was provided by using a calcium–iodine booster reaction. At th e completion of the reduction, the slag was removed and the metal was vacuum melted to remove any excess calcium or calcium chloride slag. The purity of cerium thus obtained was greater than 98% and the yields wereapproximately 95%. This tec hnique was also used to prep are lanthanum, praseodymium, and neodymium metals apart from cerium metal. 4.5.2 Reduction in a Refractory Bomb The schematic of the reactor used by Spedding et al. (1952) for carrying out the reduction is shown in Figure 4.13. The bomb (reactor) was constructed from standard black steel pipe by welding a bottom of 6 mm steel plate on on e end and threading the top to receive a standard steel or cast iron pipe cap. To preven t contact of the reaction mixture with the steel wall of the bomb a smooth surfaced refractory oxide liner was provided. The liner was a sintered lime or dolomitic oxide crucible insert ed into the bomb and held in place by filling the narrow annular space between the crucible and the bomb walls with loose lime. On the top of the bomb, insulation was provided by a la yer of lime held in place by a sintered lime lid. The threads of the bomb were s ealed effectively by plumbers seal.

Reaction was initiated by placing the loaded and sealed bomb in a gas fired furnace held at 650 to 750°C. As the bomb temp erature reached about 400°C, the reaction began and wa s going to completion in a matter of seconds, which was indicated by the sudden rise of the bomb temp erature. The heat of reaction was found to be sufficient to melt both the slag and the metal and allow the metal to collect in the form of a massive cylinder in the bottom of the bomb. The bomb was removed from the furnace as soon as it fired and was allowe d to cool before being opened. The ingot obtained was invariably very clean with smooth sides and top and contained 1 to 5% calcium and 0.1 to 1% magnesium. Average yield of the metal in the ingot weighing 150 to 175 g per run was approximat ely 94%. The contaminants in the as-reduced metal were brought down to less than abou t 200 ppm each by remelting the metal in a magnesia or beryllia crucible in vacuum. Spedding et al. (1952) carried out much of the initial experiments with cerium but noted that with respect to yields, contaminat ion by calcium and magnesium, and quality of Figure 4.13 Loaded bomb for calciothermic reduction of rare earth chloride (Spedding et al. 1952).04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 212 ingots, the results of cerium were duplicated by lanthanum, neodymium, and praseodymi- um. Kilogram quantities of these metals in high purity were prepared by this technique in addition to over 500 kgs of 95–99% pu re cerium on a 1.5 kg per batch scale. Spedding and Daane (1954) noted that this method was capable of producing very pure metals if sufficient care was taken to introdu ce only pure rare earth chloride, pure calcium, and pure iodine into a pure liner because, in the entire system, which was closed, no impu- rities could get into the metal other than calci um, magnesium, or oxygen. Both calcium and magnesium could be distilled out on remelting but oxygen remained. To prevent the intro- duction of oxygen, the calcium was handled in an inert atmosphere and the bomb was loaded in an argon atmosphere glove box. Considerable care had to be taken to ensure that the chlo- rides were completely anhydrous and free of oxychlorides because even small amounts of these materials could lead to high oxygen cont ent in the metal and also poor yields. If too much moisture was present it would invariably lead to explosions of the sealed bomb. When only rare earth chloride and calcium we re used in the charge, the heat liberated by the reaction (on this scale, namely ~170 g) was not sufficient to heat the resulting rare earth metal and calcium chloride slag to above their melting points. As a result the rareearth metal could not agglomerate into a ma ssive ingot. Iodine was added as the booster and the extra heat liberated by the Ca–I exot hermic reaction was sufficient to heat the reaction products to beyond their melting te mperatures and hence enabled the rare earth metal to collect into a fused mass. Iodine al so served to form a lower melting slag of CaCl 2–CaI2. In an effort to find a substitute for th e iodine, which was expensive, sulfur and potassium chlorate were also investigated as boosters (Spedding et al. 1952). The use of sulfur generated considerable heat, but no separation of the metal and slag occurred. Potassium chlorate, even under the best cond itions, did not produce cerium metal in yields comparable to that obtained with iodine, either externally with respect to adhering slag or internally with respect to inclusions. The method described above for the prepar ation of cerium, lanthanum, praseodym- ium, and neodymium metals by reduction of their chlorides by calcium with iodine as booster was also tried for yttrium (Spedding et al. 1952). Although the reaction proceeded vigorously enough to permit complete slag co llection, apparently sufficient heat was not generated to fuse the metal, and the yttrium produced was intimately mixed with the slag. The unsuccessful attempt was attributed to the high melting point (1522°C) of yttrium. This procedure was not successful with even the re latively low melting gadolinium (1313°C). It turned out that the method could not be appl ied to metals melting at a temperature above the melting point of neodymium (1021°C). 4.5.3 Reduction in Tantalum Crucible Two major problems confronted the attempts made to prepare high melting rare earth metals by chloride reduction. At high temp eratures, the calcium chloride frothed and thus prevented clean slag–metal separation, and the oxide liners were attacked by the metal and impurities were introduced. Subsequently, Sp edding and Daane (1952) attempted the re- duction in a tantalum crucible was a ttempted. The procedure was as follows. In a typical run, 70 g of rare earth chlori de and 18.5 g of calcium were thoroughly mixed in an inert atmosphere and either jolt packed into a tantalum crucible or compacted in a powder press into cylinders that were th en placed in the tantalum crucible. This charge contained 10% more calcium than was requir ed by the stoichiometry of the reaction 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 213 2MCl3 + 3Ca → 3CaCl2 + 2M in which M represents a rare earth element. The loaded, outgassed crucible was covered with a tantalum lid, perforated to permit ga s to enter or leave the vessel, and was placed inside a covered magnesia crucible (50 mm in diameter and 175 mm long). This was in turn placed inside a silica tube (58 mm diameter) on e end of which was fused shut and the other end ground to serve as the inner half of a 55 /50 standard taper joint. The silica tube was sealed onto a vacuum system evacuated to 0.1 Pa and then filled to 1 atm with argon which was purified by passing it over hot uranium tu rnings. The tantalum crucible was heated by means of a 6 kW induction furnace. At 550 to 600°C, the exothermic reaction between calcium and the rare earth chloride occurred as evidenced by the sudden increase in the temperature of the reaction crucible. In ab out 5 minutes, the final holding temperature could be reached, and at this temperature th e crucible was held for 13 min to permit complete agglomeration of the product meta l. The final holding temperature was 1000°C for lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and ne odymium and 1350°C for gadolinium. After cooling to room temperature, the tantalum cr ucible was soaked in water to remove the calcium chloride slag and most of the excess ca lcium, leaving in the crucible bottom a layer of fused rare earth metal containing from 1 to 3% calcium. This impurity could be removed by remelting the metal under 0.1 Pa or better in the same crucible and vacuum apparatus. The remelting temperature was 1200°C for lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neo- dymium and 1350°C for gadolinium. Lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and ga dolinium metals were prepared by this technique in 40 g lots with yields consiste ntly exceeding 99%. Calcium content in the remelted product metal was not over 150 ppm. The use of booster reaction was not necessary because external heating was used, and tantalum was more resistant to molten rare earth metal attack than any refractory material. 4.5.4 Intermediate Alloy Processes The chloride reduction as described for the fi ve metals could not be applied to the higher melting metals because of excessive chloride volatilization and decreased yields. The main problem was the need to use high temperatures so that the metal would be molten at the reaction temperature. The need for high temperatures for reaction was overcome by preparing the metal as a low melting alloy. Carlson and Schmidt (1967) investigated the preparation of yttrium metal as an yttr ium–magnesium alloy by calcium reduction of yttrium trichloride in the presence of magn esium. The excess calcium and magnesium were removed from the yttrium product by a heat treatment in vacuum. A similar process was used by Schmidt and Carlson (1974) to prepare scandium metal by reducing scandium trichloride with calcium and/or magnesium. The calcium and magne- sium from the as-reduced scandium were remove d by vacuum heat treatment. Yttrium and scandium from alloys with magnesium will be come molten at reaction temperatures that are considerably lower than the melting points of yttrium and scandium. Clean slag–metal separation was therefore possible. 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 214 4.5.5 Kroll Type Processes An effective method for rare earth metal prepar ation at reaction temperatures less than the metal’s melting point is to obtain the metal in a sponge form, as in the Kroll process for titanium (Kroll 1959). Lithium/Sodium Reduction of Yttrium Chloride Block et al. (1960) prepared large quantities of high purity yttrium metal by re ducing the chloride with both lithium and sodium. The stainless steel vacuum retort us ed for lithium reduction is shown in Figure 4.14. Both lithium and yttrium chloride react with moisture in the atmosphere. Hence handling operations, as far as possible, were performed in an inert atmosphere glove box. High purity lithium, 10 to 15 % more than the stoichiometric amount required for reaction, was added to the molybdenum crucible contai ning yttrium chloride. The loaded crucible was transferred to the reduction distillation as sembly. The retort was then evacuated to 0.01 Pa and backfilled to 35 kPa wi th argon. The charge was heated to 850°C for 1 h to complete the reaction, and thereafter the retort was evacu ated again while it was heated to 900°C for 16 h to remove the excess lithium and lithiu m chloride from the yttrium sponge. Block et al. (1960) used batch sizes of up to 1 kg of yttrium chloride in the assembly shown and yttrium recoveries were between 95 and 100%. Figure 4.14 High vacuum reduction distillati on assembly (Block et al. 1960). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 215 This procedure was also carried out in a la rger assembly designed for preparing up to 9 kg of yttrium sponge per batch. The re duction temperature was 900°C and holding time was maintained for 4 h and 45 min. After redu ction, the crucible was inverted before the by-products were removed by vacuum distillati on at 950°C for 24 h. Inverting the crucible allowed bulk of the excess lithium and lithium chloride to melt and run out of the crucible, thereby minimizing the time requ ired for vacuum distillation. The apparatus shown in Figure 4.15 was used by Block et al. (1960) for carrying out the sodium reduction of yttriu m chloride. The batch size was 0.7 kg of yttrium chloride. Purified yttrium chloride was charged into a molybdenum crucible in the bottom of the stainless steel retort and excess sodium wa s placed in the steel container in the upper section of the retort. The loaded reduction re tort was evacuated and filled with argon to between 7 and 15 kPa above atmospheric pres sure. The lower section of the retort was heated to 850°C to melt the yttrium chloride, after which the section containing the sodium was heated at a temperature high enough to vaporize sodium, allowing the sodium vapors to react with the yttrium chloride until th e reaction was complete, which took 5–7 h. This procedure, which is very similar to the Krol l process for zirconium, has the advantage of combining distillation purification of sodium with a facility for c ontrolling the reaction. After the reaction was complete, the retort was rotated slightly beyond 90° from the vertical position and the bulk of the excess sodium an d sodium chloride were poured out of the crucible. The retort was then evacuated and h eating was continued to 850°C to remove the last traces of sodium and sodium chloride. V acuum distillation withou t first pouring out the bulk of sodium invariably led to reverse reaction in which yttrium reduced the sodium chloride. As an alternative, after reduction, th e retort could be cooled, the crucible inverted and vacuum separation done as with the large batch lithium reduction procedure. Metal yields were between 95 and 99% in lithium reductions and between 61 and 85% in sodium reductions. The repres entative analysis of yttrium prepared by both lithium and Figure 4.15 Metallic reduction assembly (Block et al. 1960). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 216 sodium reduction are listed in Table 4.2. Yt trium produced by sodium reduction was lower in both carbon and oxygen impurities than that obtained by lithium reduction. Nolting et al. (1960) and Moriarty (1968) have al so used lithium vapor reduction of rare earth trichloride to prepare yttrium and other high melting rare earth metals. Lithium Reduction of Yttrium Chloride Nolting et al. (1960) carried out the reductions in the reactor shown schematically in Figure 4.16. The stainless steel reactor was 75 mm in diameter and 560 mm long. The reactor was li ned with 0.25 mm thick molybdenum foil. Two 100-mm tantalum boats (reduction crucible s) containing lithium and yttrium chloride were placed as shown in the figure. The redu ction crucibles were shaped to conform to chamber geometry and they were placed on a tray constructed from 0.5 mm tantalum sheet. A 0.125 mm titanium foil was used as additi onal liner and as a getter for gaseous conta- minants. Purified anhydrous yttrium chloride weighi ng 305 g and clean lithium weighing 40 g were placed in the respective containers and po sitioned adjacent to each other in zone 3 of the bomb chamber, after which the reactor was closed by welding the face plate into position and the chamber was evacuated to 6 Pa . The reduction was initiated by placing the evacuated chamber in a preheated reduction furnace in a horizontal position. The bomb heated to 950°C in 15 min, and this temperature was maintained for 2 h over the entirelength of the bomb. Within 5 min of exposure to temperature, the evacuation tube sealed due to condensation of lithium vapor. Lithiu m vapor reduced yttrium trichloride and the reduction was complete in 2 h. At the end of 2 h, the bomb was positioned so that the face plate protruded out of the furnace opening and an airblast was directed at the face plate. The furnace temperature was raised so that within 30 min, the temperature was steady at 1000°C in zone 3, 950°C in zone 2, and 400–500°C in zone 1. This gradient was maintained for 12 h to ensure complete removal of lithiu m chloride slag and excess lithium from the as-reduced yttrium crystals. The slag and excess reductant distil led off to the cooler surface.Table 4.2 Analysis of arc melted yttrium buttons (Block et al. 1960) Reductant Impurity content, ppm ONCA l N a L i F e C r N i S i M o Lithium 270 40 260 80 150 <1 400 100 70 <10 90 Sodium 125 60 120 30 100 <1 200 100 200 10 62 Figure 4.16 Reduction bomb assembly (Nolting et al. 1960). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 217 The reactor was then removed from the furn ace and cooled. The bomb chamber was cut open in zone 2 at the thermocouple positio n and argon gas was flushed into the chamber. The product was 125 g of bright crystalline yttrium sponge, representing over 90% yield. Some of the crystals adhered to the tantal um crucible. Yttrium thus obtained was 99.8% pure with 0.16% oxygen as the major resi dual impurity. Nitrogen, carbon, and chloride contents were 0.006, 0.007, and 0.01%, respect ively. The total nonmetallic content in the yttrium thus obtained was reported by Nolting et al. (1960) to be only 0.17%. The yttrium crystals were consolidated by arc melting. Lithium Reduction of Rare Earth Chlorides Lithium reduction of rare earth trichlorides was adopted on a commercial scal e by Moriarty (1968). The reactor used for this purpose is shown (Beaudr y and Gschneidner 1978) in Fi gure 4.17. Crude rare earth chloride was placed in a titanium crucible w ith a tube down the cente r. A second titanium crucible was placed below it and they were separated by a spacer. Both crucibles were placed on a pedestal inside a stainless steel chamber. Chunks of commercial grade lithium were placed around the pedestal. The chamber was evacuated and the upper titaniumcrucible was heated to distill the rare earth trichloride into the lower crucible. After distilling the chloride, the entire steel cham ber was heated to 800–1000°C. The lithium vapor filled the chamber and some of the lithi um condensed in the vacuum line, sealing the chamber. The lithium vapor reacted with the molten rare earth chloride, reducing it to rare earth metal and forming lithium chloride slag . After the reduction was complete, the steel chamber was partially removed from the furnace and the lithium chloride slag was distilled from the reduction crucible to that part of the steel chamber that was outside the furnace Figure 4.17 Reduction crucible used for lithium reduction of rare earth chlorides (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978).04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 218 and hence colder. After completing the disti llation, the sealed steel chamber was opened and the rare earth metal crystals were cons olidated by arc melting or induction melting. Moriarty (1968) reported the preparation of al l of the rare earth metals except promethium, samarium, europium, and ytterbium, using th e lithium vapor reduction method described. The relatively low temperature of the reductio n (800 to 1000°C) ensured that the contami- nation of the reduced rare earth metal crystal w ith the crucible material was very low. The major impurity in these metals was oxygen , which ranged from 225 ppm for holmium to 1600 ppm for terbium. The nitrogen content was below 40 ppm for all the metals. The yields of recoverable metals were between 77 and 86% after re duction at 1000°C. Lithium Reduction of Dysprosium , Holmium and Erbium Chlorides The reduction of dysprosium, holmium, and erbium trichlorides with lithium was studied by Croat (1969). The anhydrous chlorides were reduced at 900° C using lithium–5% calcium or pure lithium as the reductant. The liquid–vapor reduction wa s carried out in two steps: (1) distillation of the lithium vapor into liquid rare earth chloride at the reduction temperature and (2) distillation of the lithium chloride slag an d excess reductant away from the product on com- pletion of the reduction. Prior to reduction, the rare earth chloride was purified by one or more distillation operations. As regards the lithium reductant, approximately 5% calcium was added to the reductant in order to make the lithium vapor purer during distillation. Figure 4.18 Schematic diagram of the glove box furnace used for rare earth metal reduction (Croat 1969). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 219 During the liquid–vapor reduction process a cer tain amount of calcium also distilled and reduced the rare earth chloride. Excess calci um and calcium chloride slag were easily removed along with the lithium chloride and excess lithium. The reduction was entirely carried out in ta ntalum crucibles and retort. All operations beyond the initial preparation of the chloride s were carried out inside a controlled atmos- phere glove box. The reduction was carried out inside the gl ove box furnace as shown in Figure 4.18. The tantalum retort used both for distilling and reducing the rare earth chloride is also shown positioned in the furnace in the figure. The retort measuring 300 mm in length and 83 mm in diameter was made of 0.75 mm thick tantalum. The bottom and top ends of the retort were of 0.25 mm thick tantalum and contained thermocouple wells for measuring the interior temperature. The retort lid also contained a tantalum vent tube extending up through a hole in the top radiatio n shielding. This tube allowed the retort to be welded shut in the glove box and then evacuated and ma intained under a dynamic vacuum during the distillation of the chlorides. Th is vent tube sealed itself with lithium during reduction. Figure 4.19 Schematic diagram of the distillation apparatus (Croat 1969). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 220 The rare earth chloride was purified by di stillation and only the purified chloride was used for reduction. The distillation assembly shown schematically in Figure 4.19 was made of tantalum and consisted of an inverted cr ucible, a spacer, and a reduction crucible resting on a pedestal at the bottom of the retort. Duri ng distillation, the chloride vapor passed from the inverted crucible by way of a tube welded in the bottom and ex tending upward to within 13 mm of the lid and downward to a point approximately 13 mm inside the reduction crucible. The reduction apparatus, shown schematically in Figure 4.20, had a reduction crucible and a spacer placed on a pedestal at the bottom of the retort. Essentially, the distillation apparatus becomes the reduction apparatus by removing the distillation crucible and positioning the reduction crucible at the top rather than at the bottom of the retort. Prior to reduction, the chlorides were purified by distilling them in the distillation assembly shown in Figure 4.19. The distillation crucible was loaded with cast chlorides and covered with a tight fitting crucible lid. The loaded distillation crucible, reduction crucible, and spacer were loaded in the ta ntalum retort and the lid of the retort was welded in place. Figure 4.20 Schematic diagram of the reduction apparatus (Croat 1969). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 221 The assembly was placed into the furnace, which was then evacuated to a maximum pressure of 10–4 Pa. The retort was evacuated simult aneously through the vent tube. The required temperature gradient for distillation was provided by heating only the top of the retort by the upper heating el ement of the furnace. Dysprosi um chloride was distilled at 850°C, holmium chloride at 875°C, and erbium chloride at 910°C, an d the distillation rate was 1 gram per minute. For some runs the distillation was repeated once more and doubly distilled chloride was used for reduction. The same retort in which the chlorides were distilled was also used for reduction. The reductant, lithium–5% calcium, was loaded in to the bottom of the retort, the spacer was inserted, and the reduction crucible containing the distilled chlorides was loaded in the top as shown in Figure 4.20. The lid of the retort was rewelded and the retort was positioned in the furnace. The bottom of the retort was first heated to 300° C to outgas the reductant and allow the formation of the less volati le CaO at the expense of volatile Li2O. The entire retort was then heated to 900°C to carry ou t the reduction. The temperature was maintained for 2 h for every 100 g of chloride. After th e reduction was complete, the bottom furnace was turned off and the top furnace was maintain ed at 900°C to distill the lithium chloride slag and any excess calcium out of the reductio n crucible to the bottom of the retort. For every 100 g of rare earth chloride reduced, th e LiCl distillation temperature was maintained at 900°C for 1 h followed by 550°C for 2 h and 450°C for 2 h. The corresponding temperatures at the bottom of the retort were 640°C, 360°C, and 290°C, respectively. After completion of the reduction schedule, the retort was opened by cutting off the welded flange, and the reduction crucible containi ng the as-reduced metal was removed from the retort and placed on a pedestal inside the vacuum furnace. It was then heated at 7 × 10–5 Pa and 950°C for several hours to insure comp lete removal of any traces of lithium chloride and excess lithium reductant. The product, as re duced metal, was then recovered as bright, loosely packed crystals. The purity of as re duced metals from singly distilled anhydrous chlorides averaged 99.94 wt % or 99.2% atomic . Oxygen and hydrogen contents were quite high; approximately 500 and 15 ppm, respect ively. The oxygen and hydrogen contents of metals prepared from doubly distilled chlorides are much lower, as shown in Table 4.3.

Less than 3 ppm each of F and Cl were present in the as-reduced metal and no lithium was detected. The tantalum contents were below 30 ppm. Croat (1969) carried out the reductions in batches ranging from 0.2 to 1 kg and 20% excess reductant was used. The average yields of reduced metal from the chloride were approximately 96%, whereas the overall yields of oxide to as-reduced metal were approxi- mately 79%. The method of producing pure rare earth metals by the chloride reduction route, though feasible for most of the metals, is usually an elaborate procedure requiring great procedural care and experimental facilities, particularly on account of their hygroscopicity and volatility. These two limitations are, to a large extent, circumvented by the use of fluorides in place of chlorides in the metal redu ction procedures. As will be seen shortly, it turned out that the fluoride reduction method is technically more perfect than the chloride route for most of the rare earth metals in that the fluoride route satisfies more criteria as stated by Herget (1985) for a good metallothermic reduction method. The preparation of rare earth metals through the fluoride route essentially has two major steps. One is the preparation of anhydro us rare earth fluoride starting from the oxide, and the other is the reduction of the fluoride to the metal. 4.6 PREPARATION OF RARE EARTH FLUORIDES The preparation of rare earth fluorides for use as intermediates for reduction has been accomplished by two routes. One, known as the wet route, involves the precipitation of fluoride from aqueous solution followed by dehyd ration of the hydrated rare earth fluoride. In the other, known as the dry route, the oxid e is directly converted to anhydrous fluoride. 4.6.1 Wet Method This method consists of precipitation of hy drated rare earth fluoride from an aqueous solution followed by a dehydration step. Th e reactions involved are as follows: RE2O3 + 6HCl (aq) → 2RECl3·xH2O RECl3·xH2O + HF (48% aq) → REF3·x′H2O REF3·x′H2OR E F3 + H2O In the above equations, x is usually 6 and x′ is ½ or 1. The rare earth oxide is dissolved in hydrochloric or nitric acids. Addition of aq ueous hydrofluoric acid to this solution results in the precipitation of hydrated fluoride (HF), which is recovered by decantation or filtration. The product is dried at 100 to 150°C in air to remove adhering moisture and then heated at 300°C in a vacuum or at 600°C in an anhydrous HF stream to thermally decom- pose the hydrate. 300°C in vacuum or 600 °C in HF gas 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 223 For the aqueous hydrofluorination of rare earth solutions and to handle aqueous hydrofluoric acid and fluoride chloride soluti ons, plastic reaction vesse ls and filtration units are used. Carlson et al. (1956) have used this method of pr ecipitation, filtration, and air drying to prepare 50 kg quantities of lant hanum, cerium, and yttrium fluorides. Treatment in an anhydrous HF stream has been carried out in equipment normally used for the dry hydrofluorination process, which will be described in the next section. Minor variations from the general procedure could be found in specific cases of rare earth fluoride preparation by the aqueous rout e. In one approach, yttria was dissolved in hydrochloric acid and the solution was conc entrated by evaporation to obtain YCl3·6H2O crystals. The addition of 70% HF to these crystals results in the formation of YF3·½H2O. In another approach, liquid anhydrous HF was used. Liquid HF can be obtained by condensing the vapors in a copper coil immers ed in a dry ice bath. Dripping of liquid HF into a YCl3 solution at 100°C results in the precipitation of YF3·½H2O which is readily filterable. It must be mentioned here that generally the hydrated fluoride precipitates are gelatinous and difficult to filt er from the aqueous solution. Carlson et al. (1956) have noted that aqueous methods yield YF3 with slightly more oxygen content than the dry methods. The ox ygen content could, however, be lowered by the purification step. 4.6.2 Dry Methods Reaction of Rare Earth Oxide with Anhydrous HF The method involves passing anhydrous HF gas directly over the oxide at elevated te mperatures. The overall reaction is as follows: Figure 4.21 Furnace and rotary equipment for hydrofluorination of yttrium oxide (Banks et al. 1959). hydrogen fluoride cylinder; 2. spray chamber; 3. solenoid chamber; 4. manometer; check valve; 6. union; 7.

A stationary bed type of furnace wa s quite adequate for preparing RF3 in quantities of 500 to 1000 g (Carlson and Schmidt 1961). The react or consisted of a horizontal inconel tube having an inlet line for anhydrous HF and an outlet line for the gaseous products. The rare earth oxide was placed in a pla tinum tray inside the inconel tube, which may also be lined with platinum. The tube was heated to 700°C by an electrical resistance furnace. At this temperature, to produce a high quality product in an 8-h period, an excess of approxi- mately 200% of HF gas was required. The pr oduct (fluoride) was allowed to cool, and any HF gas adhering to it was removed by vacuum flushing with helium. Lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dys- prosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbiu m, lutetium, and yttrium fluorides have been prepared using this method. The fluoride conv ersion achieved in this process ranged from 99.90 to 99.98%. The production of rare earth fluorides on a larger scale by direct reaction of Y2O3 with HF gas has been carried out by the (i) rotary batch method, (ii) fluidized bed method, and (iii) vibrating tray method. Rotary batch method A sketch of the unit used for hydrofluorination by the rotary batch method (Banks et al. 1959) is shown in Figure 4.21. High purity yt trium oxide was loaded into the inconel inner tube, which was then inserted into another inco nel tube that could be rotated. The tube was closed and the HF gas lines were connected to the system. The HF gas was turned on when the temperature of the furnace reached 150°C . The temperature was gradually raised to 750°C over a period of about 6 h. After a laps e of about 1 h at 750°C, the inconel tube was rotated for 5-min periods at 10-min intervals. This rotation sequence was continued for a 2 h period after which the furnace and HF flow we re turned off. The fl uoride was cooled in the furnace for 12 h after which the liner containing YF3 was removed and flushed with helium. The fluoride was removed from the line r, evacuated, flushed, ground, and stored in polyethylene bags inside metal containers. A critical parameter in the method described was the amount of draft on the fluoride bed produced by the exhaust system. This draft ensured adequate sweep of HF over the salt. The amount of HF used was approximately 250% over the stoichiometric amount. About 25 kgs of high purity Y2O3 was loaded in each batch in th e reactor and the yttrium fluoride product had an oxygen content in the range of 400 to 1000 ppm. Using this method, over 30,000 kgs of high quality YF3 was prepared at Ames Laboratory over a two-year period. In the above method the rotary motion of the reactor eliminates the problem of formation of yttrium fluoride crust on the su rface of unreacted yttrium oxide. For example, in a static bed, where 25 kgs or more of Y2O3 were hydrofluorinated, the increase in the depth of the oxide bed and formation of crust inhibit the diffusion of HF gas into theunreacted oxide and result ed in poor conversions. Fluidized bed method Fluidized beds offer advantages such as enhan ced reactants contact, high heat transfer coef- ficients, and good temperature control and hen ce absence of local overheating and sintering in the charge. The use of a fluidi zed bed for the preparation of YF 3 by hydrofluorination was investigated by Knudsen and Levitz ( 1959) at Argonne National Laboratory. The04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 225 reactor was a 75 mm diameter and 1070 mm hi gh monel column with a porous monel plate distributor. The reactor was heated externally. The charge consisted of 1 to 2 kgs of Y2O3. Nitrogen was used as the fluidizing gas initially, and the superficial gas velocities were kept at 0.15 to 0.2 meters per second, which were about 50% more than the minimum fluidizi ng velocity of the bed. Anhydrous HF was combined with the nitrogen stream when th e bed temperature reached 150°C. The gases were preheated in a packed tube inside a fu rnace. As the bed temperature rose, the rate of HF flow was adjusted to control the bed te mperature and limit the reaction at a desired level. In runs of 7 to 10 h duration at 600 to 700°C, good conversion of Y2O3 to YF3 was obtained. The nickel contamination in the product was less when the temperature was lower, e.g., 600°C. Even though scaling up th e batch size from the small 2 kg charge might be feasible, this method was not used to pr epare large quantities of fluorides (Carlson and Schmidt 1961). Vibrating tray method The vibrating tray reactor (Fisher and Olson 1959) consisted of four inclined vibrating trays fixed in a cascade arrangement, so that Y2O3 would flow at a controlled rate countercurrent to the flow of HF gas. Conversions to >99% we re obtained in a single pass at 700°C. Even though certain aspects of this unit appeared attractive, completely satisfactory performance was not achieved. Reaction of Rare Earth Oxides with Ammonium Bifluoride Spedding and Daane (1956) developed a method in which ammonium hydrogen fluoride is used to convert the rare earth oxide to rare earth fluoride. The reaction is RE2O3 + 6NH4F·HF 2REF3 + 6NH4F + 3H2O and the apparatus used for carrying out this reac tion in batch sizes of 100 to 1000 g is shown in Figure 4.22. The charge was a mixture of rare earth oxide and high purity ammonium bifluoride. The quantity of bifluoride was 30% more than the amount needed by the stoichiometry of the above equation. The charge was heated to 300°C for 12 h under a stream of dry air that swept away from the system volatil e reaction products and excess NH4F·HF. The inconel baffles prevent plugging of the gas li ne because of condensation of NH4F and NH4F·HF. Figure 4.22 Apparatus used for the preparation of rare earth trifluorides by the ammonium bifluoride process (Carlson and Schmidt 1961). 300°C04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 226 The conversion of rare earth oxide to the fluo ride occurs quantitatively. Oxygen content in yttrium fluoride made by this proce ss was approximately 400 to 1000 ppm. 4.6.3 Purification of Rare Earth Fluorides Rare earth fluorides containing appreciable amounts of oxide or oxyfluoride could be purified by the following procedure in certa in cases. The impure fluoride was combined with LiF (fluxing agent) to form a low meltin g salt mixture. This mixture was contained in a platinum crucible and heated to 1000°C. Anhydrous HF was passed through the molten salt to effect purification. The purified fluori de mixture was used as feed for metallothermic reduction (Carlson and Schmidt 1961). The fluorides of gadolinium, dysprosium, and yttrium have been purified by this method. Another method applied mainly for the puri fication of yttrium fluoride (Carlson and Schmidt 1961) is as follows. Yttrium–magnesiu m alloy is a suitable intermediate product in the preparation of yttrium metal. A mixture of YF3 and MgF2 is first prepared by direct hydrofluorination of their oxides at 600°C in a static bed. In this step the conversions are usually 95 to 99%. For purifi cation, LiF was added to the YF3–MgF2 mixture in a nickel vessel, degassed at room temperature and then melted under an anhydrous HF atmosphere. Hydrogen was bubbled through the molten mixture for 1 h while its temperature was raised to 850°C. Anhydrous HF was then bubbled through the melt for 3 h, and then the mixturewas again treated with hydrogen for approxim ately 16 h to decrease the contamination by iron, chromium, nickel, and sulfur. The molt en salt was then transferred to a storage container through a sintered nickel filter. Ox ygen content in the fluoride had decreased, and by extending the duration of hydrofluorinat ion from 3 to 8 h further decrease in oxygen content was achieved. A process, known as topping, was extensively used at Ames to obtain purer rare earth fluorides. This is the second part of the two-step process described by Spedding and Henderson (1971) for quantitative conversion of the rare earth oxide to the fluoride. In the first step, a mixture of anhydrous HF and 60% Ar was passed over the rare earth oxide at 700°C for 16 h. The inconel furnace tube wa s lined with platinum, and the oxide was contained in a platinum boat to prevent cont amination of the fluoride. The oxygen content of the fluoride thus obtained was 300 ppm. Th is residual oxygen was lowered further to less than 20 ppm, by topping. Topping involves h eating the fluoride in a platinum crucible to approximately 50°C above its melting point under a dynamic HF–60% Ar atmosphere. Usually the time required for t opping is 1 h at temperature for every 20 g of fluoride. A graphite resistance furnace is used. In addition to lowering the oxygen content, topping also brings down the levels of impurity elements: aluminum, silicon, chromi um, iron, nickel, and copper (Beaudry et al. 1983). The fluorides of these impuritie s have vapor pressures approximately 10 6 times greater than those of the rare earth fluorides at their melting points. 4.7 REDUCTION OF RARE EARTH FLUORIDES Historically, the investigations on the metall othermic reduction of fluorides started much later than those using the chlorides. The impo rtant investigations on fluoride reduction ooooo 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 227 methods for rare earth metals preparation are su mmarized in Table 4.4. In one of the earliest attempts of fluoride reduction, Eyring and Cunningham (1948) prepared metallic praseo- dymium by passing barium vapor over praseodymium fluoride at 1100°C, under reduced pressure. Later, Gray (1951) developed a technique in which the rare earth fluoride wasreduced with lithium in a molybdenum crucible enclosed in a steel bomb. Iodine was added to lower the slag melting point. Reductions were conducted up to 1200°C and cerium, lan- thanum, and neodymium metals were prepared. Within a couple of years, a most enduring and successful process for the reduction of fl uorides was developed at Ames. In the Ames process, calcium was used as the reducing ag ent and the greater stability and lower vapor pressure of calcium fluoride permitted reduc tion temperatures as high as 1700°C, higher than the melting point of any rare earth metal. It was thus possible to prepare all the rare earth metals (except those exhibiting stable divalency) irrespective of their melting point. The first major investigation on fluoride re duction for rare earth metal preparation, which was usable for commercial level preparation of the metal, was by Gray (1951). Theprocess was initially adopted by Johnson an d Mathey (Lever and Payne 1968) for the production of lanthanum, cerium, and neodymium metals. 4.7.1 Lithium Reduction Gray (1951) chose lithium as a suitable meta l for reducing cerium trifluoride since it had a fairly high heat of reaction, produced the lowest melting fluoride, and did not alloy with cerium. However, as the heat of the reaction CeF 3 + 3Li → 3LiF + Ce was not sufficient, in real conditions, to eff ect a rise in temperature sufficient for melting all the components, Gray provided iodine in the charge not only for Li–I booster reaction, but also for the fluxing action of LiI on LiF slag. The reactants cerium trifluoride, iodine, and lithium were loaded into the reactor shown in Figure 4.23. This reactor was constr ucted of mild steel and lined on the inside with molybdenum. The reactants were pressed in to pellets only slight ly smaller in diameterTable 4.4 Fluoride reduction processes Year Reactants Process Results Reference 1951 REF3–Li–I; (Ce, La, Nd)Heated to 1200°C in a Mo crucible enclosed in a steel bombConsolidated Ce; separated from slagGray 1951 1953 REF3–Ca; (Gd and all RE except Sm, Eu, Yb)Heated in Ta crucible under argonConsolidated RE metal well separated from slagDaane and Spedding 1953 1956 YF 3–ZnF2–Ca Bomb reduction Low melting Y–Zn alloy; Zn distilled offCarlson and Schmidt 1961 1956 YF3–CaCl2–Ca–Mg Heated in Zr or Ti crucible under argonLow melting Y–Mg alloy; Mg distilled offCarlson and Schmidt 1961 1961 YF 3–Li–Ca–Mg YF3–Li–MgHeated in Ti crucible Low melting Y–Mg alloy; Mg distilled offHaefling et al. 196104 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 228 than the internal diameter of the crucible and loaded in the crucible in layers as shown at the bottom of the figure. A typical charge consisted of 110 g cerium trifluoride ( ≡79 g cerium), 20 g iodine, and 14.1 g lit hium (11.7 g to react with CeF3, 1.1 g to react with iodine and 10% excess). The loaded reactor was put in a pot furn ace heated to 1300°C. When, after about 15 min the outer wall of the reactor reached 1 100°C, the furnace temperature was adjusted so that the reactor remained at 1100°C for 30 min, after which the reactor was removed from the furnace and allowed to cool. In the reactor, cerium had collected at the bo ttom with the flux on top of it but cleanly separated from it. The metal yield was at be st 82.5% and the purity was consistently 99.92–99.93%. The main impurities were molybdenum (up to 0.06%) and iron (0.01–0.03%). Interstitial impurities were not analyzed, and, incidentally, no precautions were taken to exclude air from the reactor. Th e purity given was obtained by difference. Small quantities of rare earth metals, rela tively low in oxygen content and also pure with respect to most nonmetallic impurities have been prepared (Daane 1961) using the apparatus shown in Figure 4.24. The rare earth halide to be reduced and the reductant metal are placed in separate refractory metal crucible s in a tantalum container. The lid of the container is welded on, and it has a small diam eter tantalum tube that extends out of the furnace heating assembly. The system is evacu ated while it is slowly heated to a temperature at which the reductant metal begi ns to volatilize and the vapors permeate the assembly. The metal vapors also condense in the cooler portions of the tantalum tube extending outside the furnace and seal off the system by the time the system has been outgassed and gettered. During the reduction, which lasts several hours, the system thus remains free of gases that would have otherw ise diffused back into the reaction chamber Figure 4.23 Reactor loaded for fluoride reduction (Gray 1951).04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 229 from the vacuum pumping system. Heating is do ne at such temperature that the salt phase in which the reduction takes place is liquid, and equilibrium is promoted between the reductant metal vapor and the halide undergoi ng reduction. The required temperature is less if sodium or potassium is used as the re ductant or if a rare earth chloride is being reduced than if calcium is the reductant and a rare earth fluoride is being reduced. 4.7.2 Calcium Reduction (Ames Process) In the Ames process (Daane and Spedding 1953), the reductions were carried out by mixing the calcium and rare earth fluorides in a tant alum crucible in an argon environment. The fluorides were previously treated by vacuum sintering or fusion to remove the adsorbed gases from the very large surface area of the salt and also to reduce this surface area. Vacu- um distilled calcium ground to 10 mesh partic le size and stored in an inert atmosphere was used for these reductions. Mixing the reactan ts under inert gas cover decreases contami- nation by atmospheric gases. The quantity of calcium was 10% more than that required by the stoichiometry of the reaction 3Ca + 2REF3 = 3CaF2 + 2RE The charge was loaded into a vacuum-out gassed tantalum crucible that was then covered with a perforated tantalum lid. The arrangement is shown schematically in Figure 4.25. The crucible was placed in a s ilica tube vacuum induction furnace and heated Figure 4.24 Rare earth metal reduction apparatus (Daane 1961). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 230 slowly to 600°C to outgas the charge. Purified argon was admitted into the furnace at this temperature to a pressure of 70 kPa and th e heating was continued further. The reaction started between 800 and 1000°C, depending on the particular rare earth, and the exothermicity of the reaction resulted in a dist inct increase in the temperature of the charge to above the temperature of the furnace. Th e reaction was not violent and the external heating was continued to a te mperature where both the products, slag and metal, were molten. The chosen temperature was 50°C abov e the melting point of calcium fluoride or 50°C above the melting point of the metal being prepared, whichever was higher. These reductions go to completion within a few minutes after reaching the chosen temperature, and holding for 15 minutes at the maximum temperature was sufficient to achieve good separation of metal and slag. Once the re ductions had taken place and the furnace had cooled to room temperature, the crucible wa s removed from the furnace in air, and the slag layer that had formed on top of the metal in got was knocked out of the crucible, leaving a clean ingot of rare earth metal in a 97 to 99% yield with 0.1 to 2% calcium as the principal impurity. Daane (1961a) had described that in a 50 mm diameter by 200 mm high tantalum crucible, 300 g of the rare earth metal could be made per batch. The crucibles were madeof 0.25 mm thick tantalum sheets for such a batch size, whereas 0.76 mm thick tantalum Figure 4.25 Schematic of the setup for the calciothe rmic reduction of rare earth trifluo- rides (Topp 1965). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 231 crucibles were used in the semicontinuous ope ration, which produced 9 to 14 kg of metal in each reduction. Higher thickness prevents erosion through the walls during repeated use of the crucible. The cross section of a typical reduct ion crucible used (Spedding et al. 1970) for calcio- thermic reduction of rare earth fluoride is sh own in Figure 4.26. A large crucible is needed because of the low density of the starting ma terials. The volume occupied by the products of reaction is, however, much lower. Consider ing these, Daane (1961a) used the apparatus shown in Figure 4.27 to increase the amount of metal made in a heat. The charge was placed in the upper Pyrex hopper and held ther e while the tantalum crucible was vacuum outgassed. Required quantities of charge we re then dropped into the tantalum reaction crucible by lifting the valve control tube a nd as the charge reacted and melted down, more charge was added so that the crucible might be filled to near its top. Semicontinuous Reduction The calcium reduction of rare earth fluoride could be carried out on a fairly large scale, as a se micontinuous process, using the reduction and pouring furnace described by Carlson and Schm idt (1961a) for the preparation of yttrium. The principal features of the furnace are show n in Figure 4.28. The charge, which consisted of YF3 powder mixed with granular calcium (s lightly in excess of the stoichiometric amount) was introduced into the reduction crucible from a hopper through a sliding Figure 4.26 Cross section of a typical reduction crucible in calciothermic reduction of rare earth trifluorides (Spedding et al. 1970). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 232 vacuum valve. The pouring spou t below the hot zone of the gr aphite heater was sealed by a plug of yttrium metal that flowed into the tube and solidified at the beginning of reduction. Initial charge of the yttrium fluo ride–calcium mixture was also placed in the reaction chamber. The system was evacuated an d backfilled with argon. After the initial heating of the reaction chamber, to effect a reduction, additional reactants were introduced through the top vacuum valve from the hopper until the reaction chamber was filled with reduced metal and CaF2 slag. The yttrium slug was then melted out by lowering the induction coil around a graphite focus inductor that heated th e pouring spout. The metal and slag ran into the water-cooled mold below. After the pouring operation, a specially designed vacuum valve above the mold was clos ed so that the mold could be detached and emptied while the next reduction was in progre ss. The fresh charge of reactants was added to the tantalum crucible from the hopper, whil e the chamber was still hot. This procedure could be repeated until sufficient metal was obta ined or a part of the equipment failed. The reduced yttrium ingot contained 0.15 to 0.5% Ca. To remove calcium and also the residual fluoride, the as-reduced yttrium was melted into billets using a double arc melting procedur e. The analysis of yttrium thus obtained was 0.14 to 0.20% O, 0.05% F, 0.02% N, 0. 01% C, 0.03% Fe, 0.001% Ca, and 0.4% Ta. Goldschmidt Process In the industrial practice describe d by Herget (1985) for calcium reduction of rare earth fluoride, the fluori de was mixed with granular calcium and the mixture was placed in a tablet form or as ra mmed material in a steel reactor. The reactor Figure 4.27 Apparatus for reducing rare earth fluorides with calcium (Daane 1961). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 233 was lined on the inside with tantalum, which was coated with a layer of calcium fluoride. After cooling and evacuating the reactor, the me tallothermic reduction was initiated by a spark discharge. The reduction proceed ed to completion within minutes. 2REF3 + 3Ca 2RE + 3CaF2 The rare earth metal, collected as an ingot in the bottom part of the reactor, topped by solidified calcium fluoride slag. The preparation of rare earth metals by reduct ion of their trifluorides with calcium metal in tantalum crucibles leads to the introduction of up to 0. 5% tantalum as impurity. This happens in particular in higher melting rare earths because higher temperatures are reached in their production, and solubility of tantalum in rare earths increases with temperature Figure 4.28 Reduction and pouring furnace for semicontinuous preparation of yttrium metal (Carlson and Schmidt 1961a). up to 2000°C vacuum 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 234 (Dennison et al. 1966). In the case of scandium, the tantalum content ranges from 2 to 5%. A solution to this problem was in what is known as the intermediate alloy process. 4.7.3 Intermediate Alloy Process The temperature necessary for fluoride reduction was lowered and thus the amount of crucible material in the resulting rare earth metal was decreased in the large scale production of yttrium (Carlson and Schmidt 1961a) thr ough the formation of an intermediate low melting alloy with zinc, or more successful ly with magnesium. A similar process was applied to scandium also (Spedding et al. 1960). The first method using the intermediate alloy investigated by Carlson et al. (1956) involved the formation of yttrium–zinc al loy. The process was carried out in a bomb reactor and yttrium trifluoride was reduced with calcium using ZnF2 as a thermal booster. The product was a low melting Y–Zn alloy that was immiscible with the molten CaF2 slag. The alloy was eventually heated in a vacuum to volatilize off zinc leaving behind yttrium. Even though the metal prepared was of satisf actory quality, difficulties were encountered in finding a suitable bomb liner in the reduc tion stage and also in the removal of zinc. This method was investigated no furthe r (Carlson and Schmidt 1961a). Figure 4.29 Schematic diagram of the reduction retort (Carlson et al. 1960) . 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 235 The yttrium–magnesium alloy method was also investigated by Carlson et al. (1960, Carlson and Schmidt 1961a). Yttrium fluoride was reduced by calcium in the presence of calcium chloride to form an Y–24% Mg interm ediate alloy. The alloy and the slag formed in the reaction were both molten at 950°C. It was thus possible to carry out the reduction in a refractory metal crucible under an iner t gas atmosphere. Calcium chloride not only forms a low melting eutectic with CaF2 but also decreases the density of the slag, which is an important factor for complete separatio n between the slag and the alloy phases. A sketch of the apparatus used for the pro cess is shown in Figure 4.29. Massive pieces of magnesium (290 g) and calcium (680 g) were transferred to the reduction crucible and a mixture of YF3 (1500 g) and CaCl2 (1350 g) was loaded into the charging hopper. The unit was evacuated by a mechanical pump and then placed into a gas-fired furnace. When the retort temperature had reached 800°C, helium was admitted and a positive pressure of 7 to 35 kPa was maintained in the system throug hout the remainder of the run. When calcium and magnesium were molten and reached a temperature of 900°C, the YF3–CaCl2 mixture was added slowly from the hopper into the molten metals at a rate required to maintain the temperature in the reacting mass above 800°C. The mass was then brought to a temperature of 960°C. At the completion of the run the hot retort was raised from the furnace and allowed to cool in a slightly tilted position. Solidification o ccurring in this position resulted in easier slag–alloy separation. The designed composition of the intermed iate alloy was 24% magnesium, and a 10% excess calcium reductant gave a metal re covery of over 99% theoretical. The slag composition of 52% CaCl2 gave the best slag metal sepa ration and highest metal yields. The alloy was crushed into approximately 12 mm pieces in a jaw crusher enclosed in a dry box. Magnesium removal was carried out by sublimation in a 150 mm diameter stain- less steel retort equipped with a condenser. Th e alloy pieces were loaded in a titanium vessel in the vertical retort. The system was evacuated to 10–2 Pa at the outset and this pressure was maintained throughout the run. The retort and contents were heated to 900°C in an electric furnace and held for 4 h after which the temperature was raised to 950°C and held for 20 h. Magnesium vapors collected on an air-cooled condenser. The yttrium obtained was in the form of bright porous sponge co ntaining ~0.01% magnesium and calcium. The yttrium sponge obtained in the process was ar c melted in an inert atmosphere to form an ingot. The intermediate alloy method has been us ed on a large scale for the preparation of yttrium (Carlson and Schmidt 1961a). A titani um or zirconium crucible (510 mm diameter, 1150 mm height, 6 mm wall thickness) was used as the reduction crucible. The crucible was reinforced with a mild steel outer jacket. A thin titanium sheet was inserted between the jacket and zirconium crucible to prevent allo ying of steel and zirconium at the reduction temperature. In this process granular calcium (37.6 kg, 10% excess) and granular magnesium (15.8 kg) were used to redu ce yttrium trifluoride (82 kg) and CaCl2 (37.6 kg) essentially following the pr ocedure described above. The analysis of yttrium produced by the abov e process is given in Table 4.5. The purer sample on the second column was lower in oxygen content because freshly distilled massive calcium was used and the crucible was titanium which has a lower solubility in Y–Mg alloy than does zirconium. Haefling et al. (1961) conducted e xperiments to find a reductant for YF3 using an inter- mediate alloy process that is more economical than calcium, yet producing yttrium metal of comparable quality. Lithium, calcium–lith ium alloy, magnesium, aluminum sodium and zinc were all evaluated. 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 236 Yttrium fluoride was reduced by lithium meta l and by Ca–Li alloys in the presence of magnesium to form Y–24% Mg intermediate al loy. The apparatus used in these experi- ments was the same as that used by Carlson et al. (1960). A typical reaction mixture for lithium reduction of YF3 consisted of 1500 g YF3, 288 g Mg, and 235 g Li. The reactants were loaded into the reduction crucible, which was inserted into the steel retort. From then on the run was conducted as described when cal cium was used as reductant, except that the reaction temperature was 975°C and duration was one-half hour. The alloy and slag formed were both molten at this temperature. Me tal yields of 99% were obtained. The oxygen content was 0.12% in yttrium metal when distilled lithium was used, and it was 0.15 to0.2% when filtered or etha nol pickled lithium was used. Calcium–lithium alloys containing 15 to 60% lithium were also used as reductants for YF In each experiment 1500 g of YF3 and 290 g of magnesium metal were added to form Y–24% Mg alloy. Lithium, calcium, and magne sium were all placed in the reduction cru- cible and YF3 was loaded in the feed hopper. The meta ls was heated to 975°C, as described earlier for runs using calcium as reductant, and YF3 was added in incremental amounts to the molten Li–Ca–Mg alloy. The reaction mi xture was held at 975°C for one-half hour before it was cooled to room temperature, and the Y–24% Mg alloy obtained was processed to yttrium sponge. The yield of yttrium metal was greater than 99% when the reductant alloy contained at least 22% lithium. The ox ygen content varied from 0.1 to 0.2%. Using magnesium as reducing agent, mixtures of Mg, YF3, and anhydrous CaCl2 were heated to 975°C in a tantalum crucible for va rious lengths of time. However even after 4 h, the maximum yield was only 17%. The yield was only 18% when aluminum was used as reducing agent at 1000°C, and the yield was only 7% with sodium after reduction at 900°C. No reaction occurred at 900°C with zinc as reducing agent. The advantage of using lithium as reductan t (Haefling et al. 1961) lies in the low melting LiF slag (m.p. 870°C) that is form ed. With the reduction temperature 975°C, no fluxing agent was needed when LiF was formed . Lithium is costlier than calcium but the cost difference, when unit wei ght of yttrium produced is considered, is narrowed becauseTable 4.5 Chemical analysis of yttrium produced by the intermediate Y–Mg alloy process (Carlson and Schmidt 1961a) Crucible Zirconium Titanium Reductant Calcium granules Freshly distilled massive calcium Impurity Content, % Ca 0.001 0.001 Cu 0.010 0.010Fe 0.015 0.015 Mg 0.003 0.003 Ni 0.035 0.020 N 0.015 0.015 O 0.25–0.40 0.12– 0.25Si 0.01 0.01 Ti 0.005 0.15 Zr 0.7 0.00104 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 237 calcium reactant needs a considerable quantity of CaCl2 to flux the CaF2 slag produced in the reaction. The use of Ca–Li alloy as reductant for YF3 offers all the advantages of lithium reductant because all compositions of CaF2–LiF slag formed were fluid below 975°C. The use of Ca–22% Li alloy was economical because the cost savings not having to use CaCl2 more than offset the extra cost due to lithium in the reductant. 4.7.4 Preparation of Scandium The use of an intermediate zinc alloy was no t very successful with yttrium; however zinc proved to be a suitable element for the in termediate alloy process to produce scandium (Spedding et al. 1960). The process is carried out as follows: 2ScF3 + 3Ca + 3Zn + LiF → Sc–60% Zn alloy + 3CaF2–LiF (eutectic composition) The alloying of scandium (m.p. 1541°C) an d formation of the low melting slag made it possible to carry out the reduction and sepa ration of the products into molten metal and slag layers at 1100°C. In a tantalum crucib le, the reactants were sealed under a helium atmosphere by welding. The crucible was in tu rn sealed inside a stainless steel bomb in a helium atmosphere. On heating the bomb in a muffle furnace to 1100°C, the reaction and subsequent separation of products into alloy and slag layers occurred. When cooled, the crucible was opened and the alloy layer was separated from the slag. The scandium–zinc alloy, which also contained 1 to 2% Ca, wa s brittle and was easily crushed into small pieces. These pieces were heated very slowly in an induction furnace under high vacuum whereby zinc and calcium sublimed off and a porous scandium sponge was obtained. This was consolidated by arc melting under 1 atmosphere argon. The metal was obtained with an overall yield of 90% and contained tra ce amounts of tantalum, magnesium, calcium, copper, lithium, iron, silicon, and zinc, less than 100 ppm of carbon, nitrogen, or hydrogen, and probably less than 1000 ppm of residual oxygen. 4.7.5 Reduction of Samarium, Eu ropium, and Ytterbium Halides The chloride and fluoride reduction methods de scribed so far are applicable to all the rare earth metals except samarium, europium, and yt terbium. This was realized as early as in 1937 by Klemm and Bommer (1937) and corro borated in later investigations (Daane 1961a). When the chlorides or fluorides of samarium and europium or ytterbium reacted with calcium or barium, a very exothermic reaction occurred in which the trihalides were reduced to the dihalides but no metal was obtained. 4.8 OXIDE REDUCTION PROCESSES Rare earths form highly stable oxides. Amon g the popular metallic reducing agents, only calcium forms oxide stabler than that of the rare earths. The stability of magnesium oxide is only marginally higher than that of the heavy rare earth oxides and comparable to those04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 238 of the light rare earth oxides. Apart from cal cium, the only element that can reduce rare earths is carbon. In fact, at about 1700°C and a CO pressure below 100 Pa, carbon is the most efficient reducing agent. In the classical sense, therefore, the po ssibility of rare earth oxide reduction appears restricted to the use of either calcium or carbon. The important investigations on oxide reductio n are listed in Table 4.6. Early attempts to produce rare earth metals by reduction of their oxides were made between 1890 and 1912 by Winckler (1890, 1891), Matignon (1900) , and Hirsch (1912). Using magnesium or calcium as the reducing agent, they invariab ly ended up with a product mixture consisting of magnesium oxide or calcium oxide and the me tal, which could not be separated. Several decades later, Mahn (1950) pursued the magn esium reduction route. Mahn dipped fused oxide blocks of neodymium, gadolinium, or yt trium group elements into molten magnesium heated to 1050°C. The oxide block was rapidl y attacked by the magnesium metal, but the products obtained were dilute solutions (<5% RE) of rare earth in magnesium. The simple and direct attempts to reduce rare earth oxides by calcium and magnesium summarized above were destined to fail for many reasons. The stability of magnesium oxide is almost the same as that of the light rare earths at temperatures up to about 1100°C. Mag- nesia is stabler than yttrium and other heavy ra re earth oxides, but the difference in stability Table 4.6 Oxide reduction processes Year Reactants Process Results Reference 1950 RE2O3–Mg (Nd, Gd, Y)Rare earth oxide blocks dipped in molten magnesium heated to 1050°CMg–5%RE alloy Mahn 1950 1953 RE2O3–La (Sm, Yb)Reduction–distillation in Ta crucible and condenserPure RE metal condensateDaane et al. 1953 1953 RE 2O3–C Carbothermic reduction RE carbide formation Trombe 1953 1957 Sm2O3–C Reduction–distillation Impure Sm condensate Achard 1957 1959 RE2O3–Zr (Eu, Sm), LaReduction–distillation in Mo crucible and condenserPure RE metal Campbell and Block 1959 1959 Sm 2O3–Ca Reduction–distillation Sm containing residual Ca in low yieldOnstatt 1959 1961 RE2O3–Ce Reduction–distillation Pure RE metal condensateDaane 1961a 1968 RE2O3–La (Sm, Tm, Yb)Reduction–distillation in Mo crucible and Ta condenserPure RE metal condensateMoriarty 1968 1968 RE 2O3–La (Dy, Ho)Reduction–distillation Residual La, O in condensateSpedding and Daane 1968 1969 Dy 2O3–Th Reduction–distillation Dy condensate purified by redistillationSchiffmacher and Trombe 1969 1987 Gd2O3–CaCl2–Mg Heated to reaction temperature and slag leached offGd metal powder Okajima 1987 1987 Nd2O3–Ca Reduction carried out in CaCl2–NaCl bath and metal extracted by Nd–Zn or Nd–Fe alloy pool Nd–Zn or Nd–Fe alloy Sharma 1987 1988 Nd 2O3–Na Reduction carried out as with Ca Nd–Zn or Nd–Fe alloy Sharma and Seefurth 1988, 1988a 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 239 is not substantial enough for magnesium to function as a reducing agent for these oxides. Even though the considerable thermodynamic st ability of calcia qualifies it as a reducing agent for rare earth oxides, the high melting po int of calcia (2600°C) is a definite disad- vantage. During the calcium reduction, cons olidated rare earth metal is not produced because the enthalpy of reaction is not suffici ent to melt both metal and calcia slag and permit their separation by gravity. The reductio n, at best, yields rare earth metal dispersed in the slag matrix. Aqueous processing to r ecover the fine metal powder usually results in oxygen contamination. The breakthrough in the development of me thods for preparation of rare earth metals by oxide reduction came in the 1950s when D aane, Dennison, and Spedding (1953) at Ames succeeded in devising the reduction–distillatio n process. This method, which is in a way similar to the Pidgeon process for magnesium, has been remarkably useful for the prepara- tion of samarium, europium, and ytterbium, th e three metals that could not be obtained by the normal halide reduction route. 4.8.1 Reduction–Distilla tion — Lanthanothermy Systematic vapor pressure measurements of the rare earth metals (Habermann and Daane 1961) had indicated that lanthanum was the leas t volatile of the rare earth metals and that dysprosium had a vapor pressure nearly 300 times that of la nthanum at the same tempera- ture. The metals samarium and europium are also similarly very volatile. Besides, lanthan- um oxide was known to have one of the high est (most negative) heat of formation among the rare earth oxides. These observations led Da ane et al. (1953) to devise a method for reacting the oxides of samarium, europium, or ytterbium with lanthanum metal and driving this reaction to completion by distilling away the volatile metals in vacuum. The method has since been called lanthanothermic reduction or lanthanothermy. Preparation of Samarium and Ytterbium Samarium was the first metal to be prepared by the reduction distillation process. Daane et al. (1953) heated a mixture of 20 grams of freshly prepared lanthanum turnings and 20 gr ams of samarium oxide in a tantalum crucible to 1450°C under 0.1 Pa and held for about ha lf an hour. The crucible was 200 mm long, 25 mm in diameter and 0.6 mm thick. The upper half of the crucible protruded out of the furnace and had a perforated tantalum lid. On op ening, the upper walls of the crucible and the bottom of the cap were found to be covere d with a silvery crystalline metallic deposit, which analysis showed to be samarium of bett er than 99% purity with no lanthanum detect- able (<0.02%). The yields were 80% from the or iginal oxide. Several subsequent reductions obtained nearly 100 grams of samarium of be tter than 99.9% purity each time, representing an overall 95% yield. Preparation of ytterbium by the reduction–dis tillation process could be done at a lower temperature (Daane et al. 1953, Spedding and D aane 1954), due to its higher volatility com- pared to samarium, and the yield was similar. Preparation of Europium The first mention of the preparation of europium metal was made in 1954 by Spedding and Daane (1954). The details of europium preparation and handling appeared in a subsequent paper (S pedding et al. 1958). The schematic of the reduction system is shown in Figure 4.30. The reduction crucible was made from two concentric tantalum cylinders welded together. A mixture of 86.5 g Eu2O3 and 73 g lan- thanum turnings was charged in the annu lar space between two concentric tantalum cylinders welded together and shown as the reduction chamber. The chamber was heated04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 240 to 1000°C and the pressure was maintained at less than 0.01 Pa. Th e metal began to distill at 1100°C, and as the temperature reached 1 200°C, droplets of europium began to reflux. The evaporated metal condensed in the lower part of the inner cylinder and at intervals, the induction coil was lowered and the metal wa s melted down into the tantalum crucible below. An interesting feature of the above process is that the starting materials need not be extremely pure to get pure europium. Samarium is the usual impurity in europium oxide, but it is completely absent in the europium metal produced by the above process because samarium is less volatile than eu ropium, and for the reduction of Sm2O3 to metal a higher temperature is needed than that used for Eu2O3 reduction. Commercial lanthanum turnings can be used in place of the more expensive very pure lanthanum metal. Any calcium impu- rity in the charge would, howev er, be transported to europium. Preparation of Samarium, Europi um and Ytterbium and Terbium Daane (1961a) de- scribed the preparation of samarium, europium , and ytterbium. Lanthanum turnings in 10% excess were intimately mixed with the rare earth oxide and the mixture was heated in a tantalum crucible in a high vacuum to effect the reaction 2La + RE2O3 = La2O3 + 2RE Figure 4.30 Schematic of the apparatus for the reduction of europium (Spedding et al. 1958). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 241 Two types of apparatus have been used for carrying out this reaction. One is a simple tantalum crucible, the upper portion of it actin g as the condenser. The lower portion of the crucible was maintained at the highest possible temperature so that the volatile metals were recovered as bright crystalline condensates on the walls of the upper part of the crucible. Metal yields were greater than 98%. With a 50 mm diameter reaction chamber, 300 to 400 g metal could be obtained per batch. In an other arrangement shown in Figure 4.31, an air-cooled copper condenser was fitted in th e upper portion of the reaction chamber. This was first used for the preparation of samarium. The condenser was coated with an alcoholicwash of Sm 2O3 to provide a barrier to prevent contam ination of the metal deposit. A stream of air, controlled by a thermocouple attached to the condenser, was used to maintain the condenser temperature at 300 to 400°C. If the condenser temperature was too low, the metallic deposit was so powdery that it was pyrophoric and difficult to handle. Between 300 and 400°C, good grain growth was maintained in the condensate and a product that was stable in air was obtained. Ytterbium was also prepared under essentially similar conditions. Being a more reactive metal, europium needed to be always handled in an inert atmosphere. Metals prepared by the above process were found to contain no detectable lanthanum or tantalum. This may be attributed to the gr eat differences in volatility. The contents of other impurities such as carbon, nitrogen, ox ygen, and hydrogen were less than 100 ppm. Figure 4.31 Apparatus for preparation of samarium, europium, and yttrium metals (Daane 1961). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 242 Somewhat higher temperatures and a larger excess of reductant in the charge were recommended by Beaudry and Gschneidner (197 8) who have outlined a procedure for the metallothermic reduction of the oxides of samarium, europium, thulium, and ytterbium. Thulium, like other metals in the group, is volatile and a candidate for preparation by reduction–distillation. The process describe d by Beaudry and Gschneidner (1978) is as follows. The rare earth oxide was heated in air at 800°C for 15 h to drive off adsorbed compounds such as H2O and CO2. Freshly prepared chips or turnings of lanthanum that had been vacuum melted at 1800°C or higher were mixed with freshly ignited oxide. The quantity of lanthanum was 15% more than that needed by the stoichiometry of the reaction 2La + RE2O3 = La2O3 + 2RE The oxide–lanthanum turnings mixture was p acked into a 6.4 cm diameter by 25.4 cm long tantalum crucible that was fitted with a 20 cm long tantalum condenser and a tantalum optical baffle arrangement. The baffles prevent excessive entrainment of oxide particles in the vapor. The crucible and contents were evacuated and heated to a maximum of 1400°C for europium and ytterbium and 1600°C for sama rium and held at that temperature for an additional 2 h. The temperature was raised sl owly because a fast heating rate could cause lanthanum to melt and run to the bottom of th e crucible. On the other hand, in slow heating, as lanthanum reacted with th e rare earth oxide, La–La2O3 solution was formed and this had a higher melting point than pure lanthanum me tal. Once the melting point of the reducing medium was increased, the temperature could be raised to enhance the diffusion rate. A typical charge for samarium prep aration would consist of 550 g Sm2O3 and 540 g of lanthanum. The amount of lanthanum wa s about 15% more than the stoichiometric amount. After reduction–distillation, about 465 g of samarium were obtained representing a yield of 98% which was usual in the proces s. The reduction crucible could be cleaned, loaded once again with lanthanum and sa marium oxide and reused for additional distillation runs. 4.8.2 Reduction–Distillation — Other Reductants The basic criteria for a successful reduction–dis tillation process, that the product metal has an appreciable vapor pressure while all othe r components of the process possess negligible vapor pressure at the reaction temperature, is met in certain systems where in place of lanthanum, metals like cerium or zirconium are used. Both cerium and zirconium have very stable oxides and low vapor pressure and they can be obtained in very pure form. Campbell and Block (1959) investigated the use of ceri um and zirconium as reductant for the prepa- ration of europium and samarium. The diagram of the apparatus used by Camp bell and Block (1959) is shown in Figure 4.32. Samarium or europium oxides were mixed with the metal reductant (lanthanum, cerium, or zirconium) and compressed into pell ets. The reductants were freshly prepared in a finely divided state as powder or lathe turn ings. The pellets were loaded inside the closed end of a molybdenum thimble that was then pl aced inside a refractory vacuum retort. The evacuated retort was heated overnight at 200° C to remove adsorbed gases from the charge. The temperature was then gradually raised to the operating temperature while maintaining the pressure at less than 25 Pa. At th e completion of the run, the pressures were approximately 0.5 Pa. The metal (samarium or europium) collected as bright crystalline04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 243 deposits in the tapered condenser that was fitted over the open end of the molybdenum thimble, as shown in Figure 4.32. Subsequent operations for collecting the metal deposit were performed under stringent atmosphere control to prevent air contamination. When cool, the condenser was transferred to an iner t atmosphere handling chamber. The small end of the condenser was fitted into an expendable 0.125 mm thick tantalum crucible. On Figure 4.32 Reduction–distillation assembly. Figure 4.33 Split graphite resistor furnace as sembly (Campbell and Block 1959). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 244 heating the entire assembly und er argon, the deposit was melt ed from the condenser surface and collected in the tantalum crucible, whic h was subsequently peeled from the cast metal ingot. Using lanthanum as reductant, high purity eu ropium was obtained in more than 90% yield at reduction temperatures as low as 900°C. This relatively low temperature is attractive for extending the technique to co mmercial practice. However, the yield was maximum and time needed at maximum operating temperature was minimum when reduction was carried out at 1200°C. Higher temperature was needed for prepar ing samarium from its oxide using zirco- nium as reductant. Campbell and Block (1959) performed this reduction in a high tempera- ture apparatus shown in Figure 4.33. The entire assembly was mounted in a vertical position inside a vacuum furnace, and heat for the reaction was supplied by a hollow split graphite resistor mounted inside the water cooled vacu um furnace shell. After degassing the furnace and reduction equipment at 1000°C until a vacu um of less than 0.1 Pa was obtained, the furnace was cooled under argon and the moly bdenum thimble containing the pelletized charge was introduced. The charge had pellets made from 85% Sm2O3 and –35 mesh zirco- nium sponge. The furnace temperature was raised to 1450°C over a 2-h period and main- tained at this temperature for 1 h. The retort pressure during reduction was between 0.8 and 1.4 Pa. Crystalline metal deposit thus ob tained was recovered from the condenser as described earlier. Essentially the same operating procedures were adopted by Campbell and Block (1959) in the equipment for larger scal e experiments, shown in Figure 4.34. Apart from lanthanum, cerium, and zirconi um aluminum Campbell and Block (1959) tried aluminium also. It was observed that while both cerium and aluminum reduce samari- um and europium oxides, they also exert appreciable vapor pr essure at the operating tempe- rature and tend to volatilize along with sama rium or europium metals. Unlike cerium and aluminum, which tended to carry over into the crystalline de posit, neither lanthanum nor zirconium was detected in the rare earth me tals prepared with these reducing agents. Besides, the relatively low cost of zircon ium makes it commercially more attractive. The possibility of using cerium as the reductant in reduction–distillation was also mentioned by Daane (1961a). In addition, he also noted that good results were obtained Figure 4.34 Larger scale reduction–distillation assembly (Campbell and Block 1959). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 245 with cheaper commercial misch metal; how ever, the commercial misch metal often contains volatile impurities such as magnes ium, aluminum, and various halides. These impurities must be removed by vacuum me lting before the use of misch metal for preparation of highly pure samarium, eur opium, or ytterbium. Thulium has also been prepared using misch metal as reductant for thulium oxide, Tm2O3. However, the thulium metal prepared contained a few ppm of neodymi um or volatile heavy lanthanides present in the misch metal. This can be attributed to the high temperature involved in the reduction. Lanthanum or cerium was used if high purity thulium was desired. In addition to the three metals (samarium, europium and ytterbium) described in detail and the metal thulium mentioned earlier, heavy ra re earth metals that have vapor pressures significantly greater than lanthanum (but le ss than Sm, Eu, Tb, and Yb) have also been prepared by reduction dist illation. Spedding and Daan e (1968) reduced a compacted mixture of the rare earth oxide and lanthanum turnings at approximately 1500°C to prepare dysprosium and holmium metals. The yields we re 85 to 94% in these reductions; however, the relatively low vapor pressure differen ce between lanthanum on the one hand and Dy and Ho on the other manifests in up to 1% lanthanum content in the condensate. The oxygen contents were also higher. Using zirconium in place of lanthanum, Spedding and Daane (1968) obtained a distillate of better quali ty, less than 1 ppm zirconium and approximately 150 ppm oxygen, but the yields were poor, 20–33%. The preparation of dysprosium metal by reduction–distillation using thorium was re- ported by Schiffmacher and Trombe (1969). T horium filings were used to reduce dysprosi- um oxide at 1390–1750°C. The distillate wa s redistilled at 1600°C to obtain metal containing ppm levels of Th and O. The report did not mention the yield of the recoverable metal. Onstatt (1953) used calcium in pla ce of lanthanum for reduction of Sm2O3 and the samarium metal was distilled. Calcium is more volatile than lanthanum. Distillation had to be repeated 3–4 times to reduce the calcium co ntent in the reduced metal to less than 0.1%. The metal yield was only about 40%. The calcium reduction method turned out to be more laborious and less effective than the lanthanum reduction method. Achard (1957) used carbon in the reductio n distillation process for samarium prepa- ration. The distilled product co ntained considerable oxygen; ho wever, a second distillation in a Ta apparatus at 1 to 10 mPa yielded pu re malleable samarium. Europium and ytterbium were also prepared by the above pro cess. Their purities were better. The oxide reduction–distillation process, al so called the direct reduction technique, has been in commercial use since 1959 to pr oduce 99.9% pure (nuclear grade) rare earth metals (Moriarty 1968). The reduction reactor consisted of a molybdenum crucible and a tantalum condenser. It took about 2–3 h of slow heating of a reaction mixture containing 1.4 kg of oxide to get about 1 kg of me tal in the condensate. The condensate was consolidated by inert atmosphere melting and casting in an induction furnace. The direct reduction has been commercially used for the preparation of samarium, europium, ytterbium and thulium metals (Daane 1 961a, Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978). 4.9 NEW REDUCTION PROCEDURES Certain modified or new reduction procedures , using magnesium, calcium, or even sodium for reduction of rare earth oxides, have been investigated in recent years. The rare earth 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 246 metal product is obtained directly as a powder or as an intermediate alloy that has to be pyrovacuum treated to obtain the metal. 4.9.1 Direct Preparation of Gadolinium Metal Powder Okajima (1987) described a process for prep aring rare earth metal powder by oxide reduction. Fine gadolinium oxide powder was mixed with anhydrous calcium chloride powder and magnesium granules, and the mixt ure was heated at 1100°C for 1 h. Gado- linium metal powder, at over 90% yield, wa s obtained from the product by leaching it with Figure 4.35 Standard free energy change of reactions as a function of temperature (Sharma and Seefurth 1988). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 247 water followed by decantation, alcohol wash ing, and vacuum drying. The key process modification in this attempt was the use of calci um chloride to flux the slag and reduce its melting temperature. 4.9.2 Metallothermic Reduction in Molten Salt A novel method for calciothermic reduction of rare earth oxides was investigated at Gene- ral Motors (Sharma 1987). The method has b een applied to the reduction of neodymium oxide. Neodymium metal was produced by metallothermic reduction of Nd2O3 with calcium in a CaCl2–NaCl melt, at temperatures between 710 and 790°C by the overall reaction Nd2O3 + 3Ca → 3CaO + 2Nd The metal was recovered from the salt melt by extraction into a molten Nd–Zn alloy pool. Later on zinc was removed from the alloy by vacuum distillation. The basis of the technique and its application de scribed by Sharma (1987) and Sharma and Seefurth (1988) are as follows. Neodymium metal cannot be produced by the reduction of Nd2O3 with sodium by the reaction Nd2O3 + 6Na → 3Na2O + 2Nd But, calcium can reduce Nd2O3 according to Nd2O3 + 3Ca → 3CaO + 2Nd and calcium can be generated by the reaction of CaCl2 with sodium according to the reaction CaCl2 + 2Na → Ca + 2NaCl It therefore follows that Nd2O3 can be reduced to neodymium metal according to the reaction Nd2O3 + 3CaCl2 + 6Na → 3CaO + 2Nd + 6NaCl The above conclusions were arrived at fro m the standard free energy change data (Sharma and Seefurth 1988) for the vari ous reactions plotted in Figure 4.35. A metal in solution of its salt is more corro sive than when in its pure state. Thus, calcium in solution with CaCl2 or CaCl2–NaCl will react with Nd2O3 faster than pure calcium. According to Sharma and Seeforth (1988a) at temperatures between 710 and 1100°C, CaCl2–NaCl melts with greater than 70 wt % CaCl2 to provide a high enough concentration of Ca for the reduction to occur at an appreciable rate. That the reduction of Nd2O3 is effected by calcium dissolved in the molten salt phase and that calcium metal is04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 248 appreciably soluble in CaCl2–NaCl melts are critical to the kinetics of the process. Carrying out the calciothermic reduction in CaCl2–NaCl melts also facilitates separation of Nd from CaO and keeps CaO from interfering with the reaction. Nd2O3 can react with CaCl2 to form the oxychloride, NdOCl. Howe ver, the neodymium oxychloride so formed is also reduced to the metal by calcium NdOCl + 1.5Ca → Nd + CaO + 0.5CaCl2 Complete separation of the neodymium me tal from the salt phase is possible by dissolving neodymium in a liq uid metallic pool, which can be a Nd–Zn or a Nd–Fe melt. The density of the molten alloy being greater th an that of the salt and CaO, there should be no difficulty in separating the metallic pool from the molten salt. Neodymium, which melts at 1021°C, can be separated from zinc that boils at 907°C by vacuum distillation; the vapor pressure of neodymium is negligible (~10–4 Pa) at this temperature. Extraction in a Nd–Fe molten pool is preferred for the Nd–Fe a lloy destined for magnetic alloy production. Sharma (1987) carried out all experimental procedures in a helium atmosphere (<1 ppm O2, N2 or H2O) dry box that had a 130 mm di ameter by 550 mm depth furnace extending beneath its floor. A diagram of the apparatus in the furnace well is shown in Figure 4.36. The reduction reaction was carri ed out in a tantalum crucible, 100 mm diameter by 130 mm depth with a 1.5 mm thick wall. Calculated quantities of neodymium (99% pure) and zinc (99.9+% pure) metals, enough to make ~300 g of eutectic alloy, were placed in the tantalum crucible and the entire reaction assembly was lowered into the furnace well that was preheated to 550°C. After the zinc melted and diffused into the neodymiu m pieces, the furnace temperature was raised to 800°C until the alloy melted. At this stage, preweighed salt components (118 g of sodium chloride of 99+% purity and 1060 g of anhyd rous calcium chloride of 99.9+% purity) were added and the furnace temperature was decreas ed to the normal range for reduction (700–725°C). Calculated quantities of Nd2O3 (~233 g) were added to the molten bath, the stirrer was lowered into the melt, and the melt was stirred to enhance mixing of the oxide into the melt. Calculated quantities of redu ctant, calcium metal granules (91.8 g Ca, 10% excess), and sodium (~20 g Na) were added to the melt and the baffle splash guard assembly was put in place. The salt bath and its contents were quickly stirred (300 rpm) for 4 h followed by slow sti rring, at 60 rpm, for 1 h. This sequence improved the mass transfer of the reactants in the first place and promoted good separation of the metallic phas e from salt phase. At the end of the reaction, the apparatus was pulled out from the furnace we ll and quenched. Completion of reaction was ascertained by taking radiographs of the reaction vessel. A clear, sharp interface between the salt and metal pool and an incr ease in metal pool depth indicated completion of reaction. Salts were washed out of the cr ucible with warm running water and the alloy product was recovered. The product was 19 5.7 g of neodymium representing 97.9% of neodymium recovery in the alloy pool. The pr oduct analysis (in %) was 90.2 Nd, 9.9 Zn, 0.5 Al, 0.1 Si, 0.03 Ca, 0.05 Mg, and 0.05 Fe. Zinc from the Nd–Zn alloy was removed by vacuum distillation at ~1100°C and high puri ty neodymium (99+ Nd, 0.002 Zn, 0.4 Al, 0.1 Si, 0.01 Ca, 0.001 Mg, a nd 0.03 Fe) was obtained. Using a Nd–Fe pool instead of Nd–Zn pool, Sharma and Seefurth (1988) were able to extract reduced neodymium in the iron allo y using an essentially similar procedure. In another investigation, Sharma and Seefurth (1988) used sodium instead of Ca to reduce neodymium oxide and extract the metal in the ir on alloy. Sodium reduction can also be used04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 249 for obtaining the product first as Nd–Zn allo y and then the metal. This would be com- mercially more attractive than using calcium. The molten salt oxide reduction process has not so far been reported for any other rare earth, except neodymium. Its applicab ility, however, appears wider. 4.10 CARBOTHERMIC REDUCTION According to the Ellingham diagram, other th an calcium, the only element that can reduce the rare earth oxides is carbon. In fact, at about 1750°C and with a CO pressure below 100 Pa, carbon is the most efficient reducing agen t (Kruger 1971). Even the reduction of rare earth oxides by carbon is, however, beset wi th problems. Carbides are formed along with Figure 4.36 Schematic diagram of the reduction apparatus (Sharma and Seefurth 1988). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 250 the reduction. The rare earth carbides are high melting and form extensive and stable solid solutions with oxygen and nitrogen. It is ofte n possible, however, to avoid the formation of carbides in reactive metals reduction by choo sing appropriate conditions of temperature, CO/CO2 ratio, and high vacuum. These conditions are arrived at with the aid of Pourbaix– Ellingham diagrams. These diagrams or ther modynamic data for constructing such diag- rams are not available for the rare earths. Beside s, many of the rare earths are relatively low melting and/or volatile at hi gh temperatures and the simultaneous vaporization of reduced metal and CO would lead to a reverse react ion occurring and also carbon contamination. These factors have made carbothermic reduc tion very difficult for rare earth metal production. An interesting possibility of carbothermic reduction has em erged from the use of a suit- able solvent (Anderson and Parle 1976) to diss olve the reduced metal and lower its chemical activity to a level at which no carbides can form. In addition, high temperature refractory attack and vaporization loss are also avoided. The technique is yet to be tried for the rare earths. 4.11 ELECTROLYTIC PRODUCTION OF RARE EARTH METALS Unlike the chemical reduction processes, all of which basically rely on the availability of reducing agents that form chlorides, fluorides, and oxides which are stabler than those of the rare earth metals, the electrolytic reduct ion of compound intermediates for the prepa- ration of metals is not limited by considerat ions of chemical stabi lity. The standard free energy of formation of a compou nd, which is the measure of its chemical stability, is related to its decomposition potential by the equation ∆G° = – nFE°, and it can be calculated that an applied voltage as small as 4 V should be more than adeq uate to dissociate even the stablest chemical compound (Alcock 1976). Ho wever in the same way as chemical stability is one of the many qualities of a reducing ag ent necessary for it to be used in practical processes, theoretical decomposition potentia l is one of the several requirements of a compound intermediate for it to be electro lytically decomposed in practical processes. When the other requirements are also satisfied , electrolytic reduction offers an effective method for reducing stable rare earth compounds to metals. The electrolytic process for reducing meta ls from their salts or compound inter- mediates is basically simple. The salt of the me tal is dissolved in another salt or a mixture of salts that are kept molten in an inert co ntainer. Two electrodes — a cathode and an anode — are inserted into the molten bath and an electric current is passed through the circuit, with a voltage sufficient to reduce the salt. The molten salt, known as the carrier electrolyte, first of all serves as a solvent for the metal lic salt to be reduced, known as the functional electrolyte. The carrier electrolyte is so chos en as to have a desirable solubility for a functional electrolyte, sufficient conductivity for the electric current, a melting point below the chosen operating temperature of the cell, low vapor pressure, and a greater stability than the functional electrolyte. These properties ar e normally obtained by using an alkali or alkaline earth fluoride or chloride or a mixt ure of these fluorides and chlorides. Consider- able variety is also observed in the cells us ed for electrolysis. These pertain to their size, shape, materials of construction, and disposit ion of the electrodes. Iron, graphite, ceramics such as fire brick and alumina, refractory me tals such as molybdenum and tungsten have04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 251 all been used as cell materials. The anode is usually made of graphite and the cathode is iron, molybdenum, or tungsten. Often the cell itself serves as the anode or cathode. The temperature in the cell can be maintained in two ways, and on this basis the electrowinning cells associated with rare earth technology ha ve been divided into two types. In one type the electrolytic current is used to supply the heat necessary to keep the bath molten, and in the other type supplemental thermal energy is provided to the bath by a furnace or by an arrangement in the cell independ ent of the electrolysis circuit. The largest quantity of rare earth metals co mmercially produced throughout the world is obtained by electrolytic methods. Lant hanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium have melting points that permit their recovery in the liquid state by electrolysis of relatively inexpensive chlorides at temperatures less th an 1100°C. Winning of rare earth elements in the liquid state facilitates slag (electrolyte ) metal separation, minimizes contamination of the reduced metal, and enables continuous opera tion and high volume levels of production. The technical feasibility of preparing limited quantities of high melting rare earth metals such as gadolinium, dysprosium , and yttrium in consolidated form has also been demon- strated by using the fluorides as electrolytes in place of chlorides. These have been carried out in specially designed high temperature cells . The advantages of liquid product recovery and low temperature operation have been rea lized even in the case of high melting rare earth metals by using metals like cadmium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, chromium, and cobalt as cathode. These metals form liquid alloy with the ra re earth metal as it electro- deposits, and liquid product recovery is therefore facilitated. In the beginning, rare earth chlorides were electrolyzed in fused salt to obtain the metal, and the direct electrolytic reduction of rare earth oxide dissolved in a mixture of rare earth and other fluorides was investig ated later (Morrice and Wong 1979). 4.11.1 Chloride Electrolysis The important investigations on the electroly sis of rare earth chlorides are summarized in Table 4.7. The possibility of electrolytic reduction of a molten salt for preparation of rare earth metals was first demonstrated in 1875 by Hi llebrand and Norton (1 875). They prepared a Table 4.7 Electrolysis of rare earth chlorides * A: anode, C: cathode # Nd+PrYear Electrolyte Electrodes*Cell Product Reference 1902 RECl3–NaCl–KCl Carbon Water-cooled copperSeveral kg of Ce, La nodulesMuthmann et al. 1902 1912 CeCl3–NaCl Graphite(A) Cell (C) Iron Massive Ce Hirsch 1912 1923 LaCl3–KF–NaCl Carbon (A) W (C)Iron La metal (0.77% Fe) Kremers and Stevens 1923 1931 CeCl3–CaF2 Carbon(A)Mo (C)Fluorspar Ce ingot (99.8% pure) Billy and Trombe 1931 1940 RECl 3–NaCl–KCl Graphite(A) Fe (C)Refractory liningLa, Ce, Di#, misch metal (99.5–99.9% pure)Hirschhorn 196804 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 252 few grams of cerium, lanthanum, and didymium in a coherent form from the electrolysis of fused rare earth chlorides using iron electro des. The cell consisted of two porcelain cru- cibles, one of which was porous. The rare earth chloride was melted in the porous crucible, which was then placed into the other porcelai n crucible containing the sodium chloride– potassium chloride eutectic mixture. The cathode was placed in the rare earth chloride melt, and the anode, which was an iron cylinder, was located in the sodium chloride–potassium chloride melt. The demonstration by Hillebrand and Norton was followed up by Frey (1876) and by Muthmann et al. between 1902 and 1907 . Frey (1876) reported that he had prepared rare earth metals using the fused salt tech nique developed by Bunsen. Muthmann et al. (1902), Muthmann and Weiss (1904), Muthma nn and Scheidemandel (1907) reported the preparation of many metals in the cerium group (cerium, lanthanum, praseodymium, neody-mium, and samarium) by electrolyzing fused ra re earth chlorides in a water-cooled copper vessel with carbon electrodes. The cell is show n schematically in Figure 4.37. The water- jacketed copper vessel used to hold the fuse d chloride bath was not part of the electrical circuit. Copper was protected from attack by mo lten rare earth metal by a thin layer of frozen salt. Through the bottom of the copper vessel the carbon rod cathode projected into the cell. This rod was electrically insulated from the vess el by porcelain rings. The anode, which was also a carbon rod, was introduced into the bath from the top of the cell. This cell arrangement was known as the Muthmann type cell in th e early literature. Several pounds of 99.92% cerium were prepared in one experiment in wh ich a molten bath containing cerous chloride and sodium chloride–potassium chloride eu tectic mixture was electrolyzed. Cerium and lanthanum were obtained in the form of larg e nodules. The metals contained some amount of carbon picked up from the cathode. Neod ymium was recovered only in very small nodules, and praseodymium could not be electro won in this cell. The failure was attributed to the form- ation of oxychlorides. As regard s samarium, only a thin deposit of samarium metal was obtained on the cerium cat hode from a fused bath of SmCl 3–BaCl2. Figure 4.37 Schematic of Muthmann type electrolysis cell (Trombe 1957). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 253 A Muthmann type cell, with graphite instea d of copper as cell material, was used by Hirsch (1912) to electrolyze cerium and other ra re earth chlorides. This, however, resulted in the formation of carbides, which made th e bath viscous and unsui table for electrolysis. To circumvent this difficulty, Hirsch replaced the graphite container with a wrought iron crucible. Electrolysis of a molten mixt ure composed of 90% anhydrous CeCl3 and 10% NaCl at 12 to 14 V with an average current of 200 A yielded 580 g of cerium ingot in 4 h. The current efficiency was 41.5%. Iron wa s the major impurity in the metal which according to analysis was 97.8% cerium. Cerium was produced in good yield by Th ompson (1917) who electrolyzed industrial grade anhydrous fused rare earth chloride in an iron crucible that served as the cathode, with a graphite anode. In addition to ceriu m chloride, the electrolyte consisted of sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and barium chlori de added in small quantities to increase the resistance of the bath and check its decomposition. Hicks (1918) reported the preparation of “yttrium mixed metal,” a mixture of yttrium and higher melting rare earth metals, in a powd er form by electrolysis in a chloride bath at 900 to 1100°C. His cell consisted of a graphite container that was th e cathode, and a graphite anode. He observed the formation of carbides. This was minimized in later experiments by lining the sides of the crucible with alumina. Schumacher and Lucas (1924) electrolyzed fused anhydrous rare earth chlorides in a cell consisting of a cathodic graphite crucib le and a graphite anode. On finding that much of the reduced metal was dispersed throughout th e bath in the form of small particles, they raised the temperature of the bath at the end of each run by increasing the direct current amperage. This was done to permit the metal particles to coalescence at the bottom of the crucible in liquid form. The product was re melted in a magnesia crucible. The authors reported that the cerium prepared by the ab ove procedure was 99.9% pure with only 0.03% carbon and 0.03% iron as impurities. Schu macher and Harris (1926) used the same procedure two years later to prepare small amounts of cerium, lanthanum, praseodymium, neodymium, and samarium metals. For samarium they resorted to external heating at the end of electrolysis to raise the temperature hi gh enough to collect the metal in a coherent mass. The metals were remelted in magnesia crucible. The reported impurity contents in the metals were 0.03% carbon and 0.02% iron. Magnesium content was not, however,reported. Externally heated cells for electrolysi s thus began to be used for rare earth metal preparation. Beginning in 1923, a series of investigations on the electro winning of rare earth metals was carried out by Kremers and various coworkers (Kremers and Stevens 1923, Thompsonand Kremers 1925). A graphite or iron crucible was used as the bath container and cathode and the anode was carbon. The cell was heated in a resistance type muffle furnace to the required temperature. During electrolysis, th e bath temperature was kept below the melting point of the rare earth metal. Toward the end of electrolysis, however, the temperature was raised above the melting point to coalesce the cathode product. By electrolyzing the appropriate rare earth chloride–sodium chlori de mixtures in iron crucibles, cerium-free misch metal, lanthanum, cerium, and neodymium metals were prepared in quantitiesranging up to 60 grams. The metals were h eavily contaminated with iron. Lanthanum and cerium contained up to 32% iron and neodymiu m up to 6.5% iron. Similar contamination resulted when lanthanum was prepared using a graphite crucible — lanthanum carbide was formed. The metals obtained in the investigations de scribed so far were generally not quite pure. The impurities resulted from cell material, el ectrodes, electrolyte, and also insufficiently04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 254 separated rare earth starting materials. Initiall y, attempts were made to find electrode and cell construction materials that we re resistant to attack by both the molten electrolyte and molten metal. Later, as high-purity starting materials became available for the electrolysis, contamination from that source was also tackled. The first directed attempt at reducing el ectrode contamination in rare earth metals obtained by fused salt electrolysis was made by Kremers and Stevens (1923). They electro- lyzed lanthanum chloride in a bath containi ng sodium chloride and potassium fluoride using a carbon anode and a tungsten cathode. Th e cell was an iron crucible and this was not part of the electrical circuit. Lanthanum obtain ed did not contain any tungsten but contained 0.77% iron. Contamination from the electrode was circumvented. Molybdenum was recognized as a suitable cat hode material after Guertler (1923) re- ported that molybdenum is in soluble in the rare earths at red heat. Molybdenum was used as the cathode in the experiments for the prep aration of high purity rare earth metals. A carbon crucible was used as the anode, and th e cathode in the form of a rod was spinning. The cell arrangement is shown in Figure 4.38 . A fluorspar crucible was placed below the cathode in the melt to collect the product. Th e cell was heated externally to the required temperature. Fluorspar did not contaminate th e rare earth metal product (unlike crucibles made of quartz, graphite, and certain ceramic s which contaminated the product), but the chloride–fluoride melts dissolved fluorspar an d became more viscous, making the in cell operation difficult. Billy and Trombe (1931) conducted the electrolysis at 850°C using 25 g cerium trichloride and 16 g calcium fluoride as the electrolyte and obtained 9 g of cerium ingot in 90 min. The product contained only a small amount of molybdenum and no calcium. Lanthanum ingots were prepar ed by Trombe (1932) by electrolysis of LaCl3–KCl–CaF2 bath at 960–980°C. The ingot cont ained 0.05% silicon and 0.006% iron. Trombe (1932) also prepared neodymium by electrolysing a mixture of LaCl3–KCl–CaF2 at 1040 to 1060°C. The neodym ium product contained less than 0.05% silicon, 0.02% iron, and a trace of calcium. In this preparation, using a quartz crucible instead of fluorspar resulted in the silicon content in the product rising to 0.6%. Figure 4.38 Schematic of Trombe type electrolysis cell (Trombe 1957). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 255 Weibke (1939) used the Trombe type cell bu t with a crucible made of alumina instead of fluorspar to collect the metal. The molten salt was a fused mixture of LaCl3–KCl–CaF2, and molten lanthanum metal of 99.86% purity was collected in the alumina crucible. Gray (1951) essentially repeated Trombe’s experime nt with cerous chloride and obtained cerium metal that was at best 99.7% pure. His cell is shown schematically in Figure 4.39. He used crucibles made of beryllia, stabilized zircon ia and fluorspar to collect the molten cerium metal product. The use of beryllia resulted in 0.01 to 0.1% of beryllium impurity in the metal. Calcium, iron, and magnesium oxides present in stabilized zirconia were found to react with molten cerium metal. Fluorspar was found to dissolve in molten chloride causing an increase in bath viscosity. The increasin gly viscous bath rendered the electrolytic process unworkable beyond 30 min. Kojima and Sato (1954) electrolyzed a molten mixture of 108 g of rare earth chlorides and 99 g of KCl and obtained 22 g of misch me tal in about 4 h. They purified their starting bath materials to remove oxygen and also prev ented the surface of the melt from contacting air. Current efficiency as high as 77% wa s achieved by them in some experiments. A LiCl–KCl eutectic containing CeCl3 was kept at a temperature of 850°C by Eastman et al. (1955). Cerium ingot weighing 15 to 100 g was obtained in each run at 80% current efficiency. The metal yield was found to impr ove from 82 to 97% with exclusion of air from the electrolyte cell. Eastman et al. (1955) used a beryllia or zirconia crucible below the tungsten cathode to collect the molten cer ium metal. This cell arrangement was similar to that used by Trombe. The beryllia crucible was not attacked in the chloride system. A molten bath of LaCl3–KCl at 900°C was electrolyzed by Kuroda (1957) to obtain lantha- num ingot. The metal contained 0.041% sili con, 0.034% aluminum, and 0.13% potassium. A high current efficiency of 91.7% was achieve d. The effects of variables such as cathode current density, bath temperature, duration of electrolysis, additio n of KCl, and distance between electrodes on the current efficiency were all investigated. Figure 4.39 Gray’s cell for electrolysis of cerium trichloride (Gray 1951). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 256 Ivanovskii and Ilyushchenko (1 961) reported that rare earth metals can be selectively electrodeposited from a melt consisting of mixed rare earth chlorides and potassium chloride. Starting from a rare earth chloride composition of 26% lanthanum, 53.9% cerium, and 21.1% other rare earth elements, they el ectrodeposited alloys with a low lanthanum content (≤3%) and a cerium content of ≤80%. The melt temperature was 560 to 700°C and cathode current density was 0.25 to 1 A/cm2. 4.11.2 Electrowinning at Room Temperature Attempts have been made to prepare rare earth metals at room temperature in both aqueous and nonaqueous media. In aqueous solution s electrolysis is complicated by hydrogen formation even when the cathode displays a high hydrogen overvoltage, as in the case of mercury. The results of efforts in aqueous so lutions, alcohols, ethylene-diamine, pyridine, and other organic solvents have been discou raging. However, it was reported by McCoy (1941) that europium and ytterbium amalga ms were prepared from potassium citrate solutions. Starting in 1931, Audrieth, Hopkin s, and others (Audrieth et al. 1931, Hopkins and Audrieth 1934, Jukkola et al. 1934, Meints et al. 1937) published a series of reports on the preparation of lanthanum, cerium, samarium, neodymium, and yttrium amalgams from their respective salts by electrolysis in aqueous solu tion as well as in organic solvents, using a mercury cathode. Electrolysis of concentrated solutions of anhydrous chlorides dissolved in absolute ethyl alcohol yielded the best re sults. The amalgams were vacuum distilled to remove mercury. The resulting rare earth metal powders were then heated in crucibles lined with the respective rare earth oxides to resu lt in small pellets of lanthanum, neodymium, and cerium. Sklyarenko and Sakharov (1940) obtained am algams reportedly co ntaining 0.5 to 1.2 wt % cerium by electrolysis of solutions of CeCl3 in absolute ethyl alcohol, in methyl alcohol and in mixtures of methyl and ethyl alcohols. Moeller and Zimmerman (1954) reported indications of formation of yttriu m, neodymium, and lanthanum metals from the electrolysis of anhydrous ethyle ne-diamine solutions of Y(OAc)3, NdBr3, and La(NO3)2 using platinum electrodes. 4.11.3 Electrowinning Solid Metal Deposits Molten rare earth metals are markedly react ive and problems due to this reactivity was sought to be circumvented by some inve stigators by conducting the electrolysis at temperatures below the rare earth metal melting point. A mixture of PrCl3, NaCl, and KCl, which melts at 535°C, was electrolyzed by Ca nneri and Rossi (1932) to obtain praseo- dymium (m.p. 931°C) sponge. The electrolys is temperature was below 600°C. A tungsten cathode and an Acheson graphite anode we re used. Mazza (1939) obtained lanthanum (m.p. 918°C), cerium (m.p. 798°C), and prase odymium as solid metals by electrolyzing at 700 and 750°C a bath of rare earth chlorides dissolved in NaCl and KCl. The formation of oxychlorides were avoided by excluding oxygen. Relatively higher levels of purity, namely, 99.7% for lanthanum, 99.8 to 99 .9% for cerium, and 99.6% for praseodymium were reported for the product metals obtained.04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 257 4.11.4 In situ Preparation of Electrolyte A novel method of introducing rare earth into the molten chloride bath was described in a U.S. Patent of 1959 (Merlub- Sobel 1959). The compacted rare earth oxide – carbon mixture was placed in the hollow graphite anode of the electrolytic cell. Chlorine gas was passed through this mixture in the anode. Rare earth chloride thus formed permeates into the molten bath to be electrolyzed. This meth od of generating metal chloride in situ in the fused salt electrolysis cell was extensively used in later years by the U.S. Bureau of Mines researchers for the electrolytic preparation of vanadium metal (Lei et al. 1967). 4.11.5 Commercial Electrowinning from Rare Earth Chlorides The rare earth metals that have been produ ced by fused salt electrolysis of chlorides on a commercial scale (Morrice and Knickerbocke r 1961, Hirschhorn 1968) are lanthanum, cerium, and didymium (Nd + Pr). Didymium metal is an alloy of neodymium and praseodymium with minor amounts of lantha num and other rare earths. The cells had an iron, carbon, graphite, or refractory lined st eel vessel to contai n the molten bath. The cathode was the bath container itself or an iron or carbon block at the bottom of the container. The anodes were one or more graphi te rods extending ver tically into the cell through its top. Besides RECl3, the electrolyte contained NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, or other salts as preferred by the various producers, and the bath was molten even at 650°C. The cells were enclosed by steel covers to exclude air to prevent gas pick up in the metal produced. After loading the mixture of rare ear th chloride and NaCl, KCl, or CaCl2 into the cell, in one procedure, the charge was melted by ex ternal burners. In another practice, the anodes were lowered until they contacted broken pi eces of cerium metal placed at the cell bottom. Solid bath was packed around the bottom of the anode and direct current was turned on toheat and melt the electrolyte. The anodes were then raised to their operating positions. The chloride bath was raised to a temperature between 800 and 900°C by passage of direct current and external heating was norma lly not required during electrolysis. During electrolysis the metal collected at the bottom of the cell. The metal could be maintained in the molten state by resistance heating. Alternatively, the metal might be allowed to solidify by use of a cooled cathode, in which case it would be necessary to remelt the metal by internal resistance heating, some times supplemented by an external source of heat, prior to its removal from the cell. The electrolysis was continued as long as the current efficiency or the metal quality was acceptable. The liquid metal product migh t be removed at fixed intervals by ladling, and additional chloride was introduced as needed to replace that used in the electrolysis. In one practice the product was collected by pouri ng the entire contents of the cell, including the bath, into molds. After the metal had sett led to the bottom of the mold, the liquid bath was returned to the cell and electrolysis was started again. Lanthanum, cerium, and didymium metals of better than 99% purity have been electrowon commercially from their anhydrous ch lorides. The purities of metals obtained are listed in Table 4.8. Metals of high purity could be produced if carefully purified feed materials were used and if cell atmosphere composition was controlled. Current effici- encies of chloride cells were usually between 45 and 50%. The maximum operating temperature of the chloride cell is 1100°C, and neodymium (m.p. 1021°C) is the highest melting rare ear th metal that can be produced by chloride oooooo 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 258 electrolysis. However, the yield of neodymium in such a cell is very low (Seon and Barthole 1986). At high temperatures in a chloride elect rolyte bath, the volatility of bath constituents becomes unacceptable, the solubility of metals in their chlorides increases significantly, and the attack of cell wall materials by the rare earth metals becomes severe. Considerably higher temperature operation, however, is poss ible in cells using fluoride electrolyte baths. 4.11.6 Oxide –Fluoride Electrolysis Rare earth metal preparation by electrolysis of a fluoride–oxide bath was first reported This was followed by many other investigations listed in Table 4.9. Muthmann and Scheidemandel (1907), using a modification of the Muthmann type cell described earlier for chloride electrolysis, prepared cerium ingot by electrolysis of CeF3–CeO2. The fluoride was prepared by precipitation with hydrofluoric acid and contained silicates. The cerium metal obtained was reported to be only 86.48% pure and contained 12.49% SiO2 and 0.87% Fe. They also electrolyzed CeO2 in mixtures of CeF3, NaF, and KF, in an attempt to have a lower melting electrolyte and conduct electro lysis at lower temperature. However, these electrolytes yielded only sodium and potassi um metals. Electrolysis of rare earth oxy- fluoride baths using carbon and graphite electro des at temperatures of ~1400°C resulted in the formation of only carbides (Hirsch 1911). The bath melting temperature could not be ooo Table 4.8 Analysis of lanthanum, cerium and didymi um metals electrowon commercially from chloride electrolytes (Morrice et al. 1961) aincludes all rare earth elements other than cerium nd: not detected nr: not reportedElement Analysis, % Lanthanum Cerium Didymium La 99.6 0.95 Ce 0.09 0.20 Nd 0.04 72.1 Pr 0.05 27.2Sm 0.03 0.3 Other rare earth elements nd 0.10 and Al 0.01 0 0.10Ca 0.01 0.02 0.10 Fe 0.11 0.19 0.05 Mg 0.10 0.02 0.10 Si 0.04 0.002 0.07 Mn nr 0.02 nrP nr 0.001 nr C nr 0.05 nr On r n r n rNn r n r n r04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 259 lowered by addition of KF. In 1918, Hicks (19 18) attempted to prepare a mixture of yttrium with other high melting rare earth metals by electrolyzing either a fused yttrium earths chloride bath or a solution of yttrium earths oxide in cryolite. The cell comprised a graphite container, which was the cathode, a graphite anode and the molten bath, which was ope- rated at temperatures up to 1300°C. The product was some black powders. Gray’ s Cell The most successful among the ear ly experiments on oxide–fluoride electrolysis was reported by Gray (1951). In his experiments, CeO2 was dissolved in a CeF3–LiF–BaF2 electrolyte contained in an extern ally heated 57 mm inside diameter carbon container. A schematic of the electrolysis cell used by Gray is shown in Figure 4.40. The cell pot was made of “Delanium” carbon, which was found to be quite impervious to the melt and protected the nickel can in wh ich it was enclosed. The ash content of (2.3%) of the Delanium carbon was high, and so it wa s lined on the inside with a high purity (ash content <0.01%), though somewhat porous, graphite. The anode was also made of high purity graphite rod and the cathode was a mo lybdenum rod; both were suspended from the top and immersed in the melt. The bath, cell ma terials, electrodes, and the product were all protected from the atmosphere by argon gas, which was continuously flowing around the cathode and over the top of the molten bath. A molybdenum crucible was kept below thecathode to collect the product. Gray chos e molybdenum to contain molten cerium because he had found that unless it is oxidized, mo lybdenum does not dissolve in cerium. The bottom of the cell was lined with a thin sh eet of molybdenum to prevent any accidentally spilled cerium reacting with graphite to fo rm cerium carbide. Cerium oxide was added to the bath on the side of the cell opposite to the cup. The electrolyte, comprising 60.8% CeF 3, 26.9% LiF, and 12.3% BaF2, was molten at 715°C and dissolved 3–5% CeO2 at 850°C. Electrolysis was carried out at 880–900°C at cathode current density of 5.0–7.0 amp cm–2. The normal cell voltage was 4.4 V. Molten cerium metal dropped off the cathode and co llected in the molybdenum cup kept below. Yields of up to 77% were obtained and th e overall purity of the metal was 99.7–99.8% cerium.

Much of the later work and furthe r development of the oxide–fluoride electro- lysis process was carried out at the Reno Meta llurgy Center of the U.S. Bureau of Mines during the 1960s (Morrice and Wong 1979). Reno Cell Type 6 Many types of electrolytic cells were designed and used at Reno for carrying out oxide–fluoride electrolysis. The fi rst was a 150 mm (6 inch) diameter electro- winning cell, known as cell type 6 (Morrice and Knickerbocker 1961, Morrice et al. 1961). The cell consisted of a 6-inch diameter bath container made of graphite. Three 10-mm diam- eter molybdenum cathodes and three 25-mm di ameter carbon anodes extended down into the container through its top. This electrode a rrangement was first used to melt the bath with alternating current and later used fo r electrolysis with direct current. The cell was located within a controlled atmosphere temperature pressure (CATP) steel chamber in which atmosphere, temperatur e, and pressure were controlled. All cell operations, such as feeding, electrowinning, and raising and lowering electrodes, could be conducted while the electrolytic cell and its co ntents remained under the protected atmos- phere within the chamber. The standard procedure for the electrowinnin g of high purity cerium using cell type 6 was as follows: first, the solvent phase electrolyte (73% CeF3, 15% LiF, and 12% BaF2 powders) was vacuum dried at about 280°C and transferred to the cell chamber. The chamber was evacuated to 2 Pa and back filled with high purity argon or helium. The dried solvent powder was packed into the graphite cell container. A graphite resistor ring was placed on top of the powder and the electrode s were lowered to make contact. On passing alternating current (AC) through the electrode s and the ring, the powder melted and after sufficient melt had been obtained to carry th e current, the graphite ring was removed and AC melting was continued until adequate qua ntity of the melt reached the temperature ooooo Figure 4.40 Gray’s cell for electrolysis of cerium dioxide dissolved in fused fluorides (Gray 1951). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 261 sufficient for electrolysis, 810–830°C. The solubi lity of ceria in the bath at the electrolysis temperature was in the range of 1 to 2%. One of the important features of the cell was the formation of a layer of frozen bath or skull on the interior surface of the graphite container. The skull prevents the molten electrowon rare earth metals from contacting the graphite crucible. The thickness of the insulation on th e side walls and bottom of the graphite cell, and the geometry of the electrode with respect to the side wall and bottom of the cell were so chosen as to maintain this electrolyte sk ull. An automatic vibrating screw feeder was used for continuous feeding of CeO2 powder into the molten electrolyte. The feeder with hopper was located outside the cell chamber but was so arranged that it operates in the same controlled atmosphere as the cell. The feeder was also refillable without contaminating the cell atmosphere. After melting the bath, the feed er was turned on and 10–20 g of previously vacuum dried CeO2 powder was added to the bath. The AC supply was disconnected and direct current was turned on for electrolysi s to occur. During the electrolysis, CeO2 was continuously fed to the molten bath at a ra te of 7 g per minute. Massive cerium nodules formed as a result of electrolysis and in abou t 2 h these nodules bridged the gaps betweenTable 4.10 Cell operating data and product analysis in a typical type 6 cell (USBM) run for electrowinning of cerium metal (Morrice et al. 1961) Electrolysis parameters Electrolyte composition, % 73 CeF3–15 LiF–12 BaF2 Temperature, °C 810–830 Cathode 10 mm diameter Mo rods, 3 nos.

After cooling the bath to room temperature within the cell atmosphere, the frozen mass was taken out in open air and broken up to recover the cerium nodules. Deta ils of a sample electrowinning run and the product obtained are summarized in Table 4. 10. In the process described, cerium was prepared as a liquid at temperatures very cl ose to its melting point. This circumvented certain difficulties, such as entrapment of el ectrolyte, which is inherent in recovering the product as a solid, and also minimized cont amination of metal with impurities present in molten bath. One major problem, however, was the excessive corrosion of both carbon and graphite anodes at or above the surface of th e bath. This was caused by molecular oxygen, generated by the electrolytic reaction and pres ent in the cell atmosphere (Morrice et al. 1961). Reno Cell Type 12 These are electrolytic cells in wh ich the electrolyte was contained in a ~300 mm (12 inch) diameter graphite cr ucible. These cells, called type 12 cells, were extensively used at Reno (Shedd et al. 1964). Initially experiments were conducted in which the metal product was collected in an el ectrolyte skull, and in later experiments cells designed for continuous operation were used. As with the type 6 cell, the electrolyte cell components were all enclosed in a gas-tight chamber. The arrangement of the type 12 cell components and the electrolyte skull is shown in Figures 4.41 and 4.42. The anode, which is a graphite tube (120 mm outside diameter, 75 mm inside diameter, 560 mm long) suspended vert ically in the center of the crucible, also acted as a feed tube for adding electrolyte or cerium oxide to the cell. Molybdenum or Figure 4.41 Electrolytic cell in protective atmosphere chamber (Shedd et al. 1964). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 263 tungsten rods 10 mm in diameter were used to make the nine cathodes that were arranged in a circle 30 mm from the anode surface. The vacuum dried electroly te constituents, 73% CeF3, 12% BaF2, and 15% LiF, were fed and packed into the graphite crucible. Ce rium was the metal electrowon. The bath was melted initially as described for the type 6 cell, using AC. After the top portion of the electrolyte was liquid and the bottom 100 to 120 mm consisted of sintered electrolyte that provided a skull surface on which electrowon cerium collected, operating temperatures of 850 to 900°C were maintained using AC current for 30 to 45 min to obtain a uniform melt temperature. The cerium oxide feeder was star ted at a predetermined controlled feed rate of 26 to 30 g/min for 5 min before the pow er was switched to direct current. With an electrode immersion of 40 mm, the power requ irement was 800 to 900 amperes and 7 to 8 Figure 4.42 Electrolytic cell with electrolyte skull hearth (Shedd et al. 1964). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 264 volts. This current was sufficient to main tain an operating temperature above 850°C. Cerium was deposited on and dripped from th e cathodes and collected as nodules on the electrolyte skull initially in small pieces, and th en after 1 h, as temperature profile improved, in large massive pieces weighing 3 to 4.5 kgs. The oxide content of the electrolyte was kept between 1 and 2% throughout the run and electrolysis was continued for 15 to 20 minutes after termination of oxide feed. Analysis of electrolyte after the run show ed the oxide content to be 0.06 to 0.3%. The metal produced by the above procedure, using an electrolyte skull, had a purity of at least 99.8%. Over 90% of the metal in the oxide feed was recovered at a current efficiency that ranged from 75 to 90%. The an alysis of cerium obtained is shown in Table 4.11. In electrolysis with CeO2 as feed material, a major problem was excessive burning of the interior of the anode surface, in a nonu niform manner. The nonuniform anode burning was eliminated using cerous oxide, Ce2O3, as feed. When Ce2O3 was fed to the cell, the corrosion was uniform and limited to the imme rsed portion. Otherwise the run was similar to that using CeO2 as feed. Reno Continuous Cell Type 12 Subsequent to the batch ty pe 12 cell where metal was collected in a frozen electrolyte skull, a new cell design was developed at Reno for conti- nuous electrolysis (Shedd et al. 1964). The key feature in the cell shown in Figure 4.43 is that the bottom and sides of the graphite crucible were lined with a molybden um sheet and a tapping pipe was attached to the molybdenum hearth so that the molten metal could be tapped. The tapping pipe extended into an inert atmosphere casting chamber. When the molybdenum hearth or trough was nearly filled with cerium, an auxili ary AC heating circuit could be used to heat the tapping pipe without interrupting the elect rowinning sequence. To serve as an electric probe for the AC circuit, a 19 mm diameter molybdenum rod was submerged in the melt. An auxiliary carbon resistance heati ng unit was located beneath the cell.

The dry weight composition of the electrolyte was 63% CeF3, 16% BaF2, and 21% LiF and the cell was operated at 900°C. Ce2O3 was the cell feed and was fed at a predetermined uniform rate of 30 g per minute during electrowinning. A typical continuous electrowi nning run extended over three days, during which metal was electrowon and several tappings of ho mogeneous cerium metal were made. The electrolyte was also tapped and recharged to the cell. The anode was changed as needed and electrowinning was resumed. A total of 12 kg s of cerium was tapped. The metal purity was 99.8%, and the impurities in the metal are list ed in Table 4.11. Molybdenum figured as a major impurity and was formed due to the hearth ’s dissolving in cerium during the extended retention time. Tungsten contamination under similar circumstances would be much less, but tungsten sheets in dimensions large enough to make the hearth were difficult to obtain. Cells for Electrowinning Lanthanum Morrice et al. (1962) attempted to electrowin molten lanthanum metal from lanthanum oxide in a LaF3–LiF–BaF2 bath using the same electrode arrangement (Morrice et al. 1960) that worked well in the case of cerium (m.p. 798°C). The direct current (DC) power th at this cell could carry was not high enough to maintain the electrolyte temperature n eeded for the deposition of molten lanthanum (m.p. 918°C). This problem was solved by an improvement in the electrowinning cell as depicted in Figure 4.44. AC was used across the anodes as an auxiliary source of heat to maintain the required bath temperature. Th e lanthanum electrowinning cell was operated using an arrangement in which AC was impos ed on the two anodes, and DC was imposed on one anode and the cathode. The operating da ta of the cell and analysis of the product Figure 4.43 Design of cell used to study parameters for continuous operation (Shedd et al. 1964). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 266 obtained are listed in Table 4.12. This cell th at operated with a current efficiency of about 60% yielded lanthanum nodules containing car bon and oxygen as major impurities. The total impurity content was, ho wever, between 0.1 and 0.2%. A cell for continuous electrolysis was al so developed at Reno (Shedd et al. 1966) for lanthanum metal. The electrode and hearth arrangement in this cell are different from those in the cell used for cerium. Shedd et al. (1966) stated that the ability of cerium to exist in +4 and +3 states permits sustenance of el ectrolysis even with a small anolyte volume oooooo Figure 4.44 Imposed AC cell for electrowinning lanthanum (Morrice et al. 1962). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 267 provided by a single anode. For lanthanum, which has only the trivalent ion species, to achieve sustained electrolysis, a greater propor tionate volume of the electrolyte is needed as anolyte. This is possible in the different electrodes arrangement shown in Figure 4.45, where the anodes are placed surrounding the cathode. Increased anolyte volume offered greater opportunity for the electrolyte to diss olve the oxide and make it available to the anode for reaction. Besides, the cerium cel l arrangement could not support sufficient current to maintain the higher operating temp erature required for molten lanthanum metal. The cell had eight high purity graphite ro ds, each 38 mm in diameter, functioning as anodes. There was, however, only a simple cathode made of a 25 mm diameter arc cast molybdenum rod screwed into a graphite plug in the bottom of a centr al graphite tube. The cone shaped plug had four holes drilled throug h the tube and the momentum of the particles striking the cone deflected the oxide feed closer to the anode. The electrodes were suspended vertically from copper support clamps that also served as electrical contacts, as shown in Figure 4.46. Shedd et al. (1966) used a batch type cell shown in Figure 4.46 to establish the electrode geometry, oxide feed rate, and optimum oper ating parameters. Subsequently, instead of collecting molten lanthanum in the electrolyte skull, a refractory metal crucible was placed in the bottom of the cell directly below th e molybdenum cathode. Molten lanthanum was ladled from the tungsten hearth and cast in to two-pound ingots. Both frozen electrolyte oooooTable 4.12 Operational data and product analysis in lanthanum electrowinning (Morrice et al. 1962) Electrolyte composition, % 54.7 LaF3–30.3 LiF–15 BaF2 Temperature, °C Electrolyte 946 Cell bottom 711 Cathode MolybdenumAnode Carbon Electrolysis Voltage, V 12 Current, A 159 Duration, hr 3 Initial anode current density, A/cm 26.2 Cathode current density, A/cm21.5 Current efficiency, % 60La 2O3 added to bath before electrolysis, g 1320 La2O3 added during electrolysis, g 886 Lanthanum metal recovered, g 451Metal recovery, % 60 DC power consumed kWh per kg La 17.3 AC power consumed kWh per kg La 17.3 Analyses of lanthanum metal nodules, %.

The chamber was maintained at a partial vacuum (10 kPa) by continuously discharging the carbon oxide gases during the electrowinning. The occurrence of anode effect was found to be markedly reduced under partial vacuum. The electrolytic cell with tapping facilities for continuous electrowinning of lantha- num is shown in Figure 4.47. The hearth of the cell was a tu ngsten crucible 100 mm in dia- meter and 100 mm in depth. A molybdenum pi pe was connected to the tungsten crucible through a ½ inch diameter hole drilled in the side of the crucible. The pipe extended about Figure 4.45 Special electrode arrangement in Reno cells for lanthanum electrowinning (Shedd et al. 1966). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 269 760 mm into the casting chamber. Electrical co nnections were provided so that the pipe could be heated by passing AC th rough it and the submerged cathode. The cell operating parameters and product ob tained in continuous electrowinning of lanthanum are listed in Table 4.13 (Shedd et al. 1966). The electrolyte containing 48% LaF3, 27% BaF2, and 25% LiF was loaded into the graphite crucible. The La2O3 solubility in this electrolyte was 2 wt % at the cell operating temperature. The cell operating temperature of 1000°C was attained by altern ating current. During electrolysis, oxides of carbon formed in the cell were continuously re moved and flushed out with helium gas. The electrolysis sequence lasted about 2 h, and af ter every sequence the alternating current was switched on through the tap pipe, auxiliary heat was supplied through the bottom heating elements to maintain the cell bottom at 1000 °C, and the metal flowed from the cell through the pipe to the casting cham ber where it collected in la dles. Several such tappings of homogeneous lanthanum metal could be made before it was time to tap the electrolyte itself from the cell. Lanthanum produced by the co ntinuous electrowinning process was 99.81% pure. The impurities content (in %) in tapped lanthanum metal are Al 0.03, C 0.033, Fe 0.027, Mo 0.028, O 0.016, and Si 0.055. The elements tungsten, copper, calcium, and barium were not detected. The carbon content of the metal in the first tapping was very low but increased with successive ingots to 0.12 % in the last ingot. The other impurities, however, showed a gradual decrease. The rise in the carbon content probably resulted from carbon spalling from the cell components, and this carbon collected on the melt surface contacting the nascent metal.

For neodymium, the operating tem- perature would be 1100°C and the metal produ ced would probably have higher impurities than lanthanum or cerium, because of higher operating temperature. Cell for Electrowinning Neodymium, Praseodymium, and Samarium The details of the cell used at Reno (Morrice and Henrie 1967) for electrowinning neodymium, praseodym- ium and didymium metals are shown in Figure s 4.48, 4.49 and 4.50. As in the cases of cerium and lanthanum, these metals and the elec trolyte constituents also react with air at the cell operating temperatures. The cell was ther efore enclosed in a gas tight steel chamber oo Figure 4.47 Electrolytic cell with tapping facilities for lanthanum electrowinning (Shedd et al. 1966). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 271 as shown in Figure 4.48. The provision of glove and view po rts made it possible to add electrolyte and feed and to adjust the electrodes during the electrowinning experiments. Heat lost from the exposed electrodes and molt en bath could raise the ambient temperature within the chamber to >100°C. The refrigerati on unit installed in the chamber, however, maintained the ambient temperature at <50°C. The graphite crucible for holding the molten electrolyte had an inside diameter of 100 to 125 mm and a depth of 150 mm. The cathode was a 5 mm diameter tungsten rod, and the anode was graphite rods 19 to 25 mm in di ameter. The cell was internally heated by applying AC between the two anodes. This desi gn is indicated in Figu re 4.49. To obtain a thermal gradient in the cell, for developing an d maintaining a frozen electrolyte cell in the metal collection zone, while the cell was in ternally heated, the cell bottom was simul- taneously cooled. To start with, an inert atmosphere was obta ined in the cell chambers by pumping down and backfilling with helium. The fluoride el ectrolyte powder was charged in the cell and melt down was initiated by short circuiting th e AC between the anodes and crucible. After obtaining a molten pool of electrolyte, the anodes were raised to electrolysis position, additional electrolyte powder was charged, and heating continued until the required cell temperature was attained.

By a controlled flow of air or helium through the copper coil located beneath the crucible, the desired temp erature gradient between the zones of metal deposition and collection was maintained. After completion of electrolysis, the electrolyte was allowed to cool to ambient temperature before the crucible was removed and crushed, metal nodules recovered, and crushed electrolyte returned for use as bath in the next experi- ment. The operational parameters and analysis of product attained in typical electrowinning experiments for neodymium, praseodymium, and didymium (Morrice and Henrie 1967, Morrice et al. 1968) are summarized in Table 4.14. The results at Reno show the possibility of preparing high purity neodymium, praseo- dymium, and didymium by electrolysis of the oxides in a medium consisting of the Figure 4.48 Protective atmosphere chamber (Morrice and Henrie 1967).

The metals with overall 99.9% purity contained <0.02% each carbon and oxygen and <0.025% tungsten as major impurities. Current efficiencies were upto 83%. In th e electrowinning of didymium, the didymium metal product was enriched in neodymium an d praseodymium and impoverished in lantha- num, samarium, and yttrium, as comp ared to the oxide fed to the cell. High Temperature Electrowinning Cell A high temperature electrowinning cell, also from Reno (Henrie and Morris 1966), operatin g in the temperature range 1370–1700°C and used for preparation of liquid gadolinium, dysp rosium, and yttrium is shown in Figure 4.51. The electrolyte was contained in a graphite crucible 100 to 125 mm in diameter and 150 mm deep. The anodes were 19 mm diameter graphite rods, and the cathode was a 5 mm diameter tungsten rod. The cell was heated inte rnally by DC and the electrolysis current was supplemented by AC applied between the gr aphite anodes, which supplied approximately 75% of the total power. The graphite anodes were fluted to provide maximum possible sur- face area for the anode electrochemical reaction and decomposition of the rare earth oxide to CO, which was the rate-controlling step in the cell operation. The cell bottom could be cooled by passing helium or air through the co pper coil placed below the graphite crucible. The cell, like all the others from Reno, was en closed in an inert atmosphere (CATP) cham- ber to prevent reaction of the cell compon ents and chemicals with the atmosphere. In the construction of the high temperat ure cell, the materials were taxed to the extremes, and Morrice et al. (1968) used a judicious combination of materials to design a satisfactory cell. A shell fabricated from laye rs of various heat insulating refractory materials surrounded the cell container to help maintain the required heat balance (see ooooo Figure 4.50 Electrowinning cell with AC applied to two anodes (Morrice and Henrie 1967). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 274 Table 4.14 Cell operating data for electrowinning of neodymium, praseodymium and didymium (Morrice et al. 1968) Electrolysis parameters Neodymium Praseodymium Didymium Electrolyte composition, mole % 50NdF3–50 LiF 50NdF3–50 LiF 50NdF3–50 LiF Temperature, °C Electrolyte 1098 1030 1115 Skull (cell bottom) 740 800 770 Cathode 5 mm diameter W rod Anode 19 mm diameter graphite (fluted) Heating (AC) Voltage, V 52 38 45Current, A 89 130 136 Anode current density, A·cm –22.0 1.9 2.5 Electrolysis Voltage, V 27 19 24Current, A 55 50 60 Duration, h 2 1.1 1.4Initial cathode current density, A·cm –2 6.9 6.0 9.6 Initial anode current density, A·cm–20.6 0.3 0.6 Current efficiency, % 77 88 55REO added, g 312 196 197Metal recovered, g 151 85 82 Analysis of neodymium and praseodymium nodules a, %. aThe impurity content in didymium was similar to neodymium and praseodymiumImpurity element Neodymium Praseodymium C 0.014 0.010 N 0.001 0.002 O 0.015 0.018 F 0.040 0.030 Si 0.005 0.003 Al 0.002 0.010 Ca 0.005 0.005 Fe 0.012 0.012 Li 0.013 Not determined Mg 0.005 0.003 W 0.020 0.020 Other RE elements 0.020 0.060 Total 0.150 0.170 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 275 Figure 4.51). The inner wall of the shell wa s made from fused alumina. Castable alumina, 50 mm thick, was then placed around the inner wall. Then there was an outer wall, 100 mm thick, made from mullite brick. Granular al umina was placed below the graphite crucible to a depth of approximately 40 mm. The top of the cell was removable and was also made of mullite firebrick and had a graphite facing to protect the bricks from erosion by the fluoride vapor and splashing electrolyte. The electrolyte for gadolinium electrowinn ing consisted of an equimolar mixture of GdF3 and LiF. Gadolinium oxide was fed to the molten electrolyte maintained at 1370°C. The metal was deposited as liquid at the cat hode and dropped down to collect as modules in the frozen electrolyte skull at the bottom of the graphite crucible. The bottom was maintained at 810°C by cooling the bottom of the cell. Such a difference between the temperature of deposition and collection was essential to achieve high recovery and to ensure high purity of the metal product. A typical gadolinium nodule contained 0.05% carbon, 0.01% oxygen, and 0.05% tungsten as major impurities. Liquid yttrium and dysprosium were also electrowon from their oxides dissolved in melts composed of 50 mo le% LiF and 50 mole% YF3 or DYF3. The metals were deposited on the cathode at 100 to 200°C above their me lting points (m.p. of Dy 1412°C, m.p. of Y 1522°C) and collected at temperatures 4 00 to 500°C lower. Yttrium and dysprosium nodules thus recovered contained as lit tle as 0.08% carbon and 0.10% oxygen. The highest temperature at which an electro lysis cell operated was 1700°C for the pre- paration of liquid yttrium. Morrice et al. (1968) noted that at such temperatures reactions are taking place with energies comparable to those found in arc furnaces. The 100 to 150mm diameter gadolinium and yttr ium cells needed a power inpu t of 12 to 15 kW, which is more than the 9–10 kW power requirement in a typical 300 mm diameter lanthanum or cerium cell (Henrie and Morrice 1966). In addi tion the yttrium cell volume having a higher power requirement is only one-ei ghth the volume of the cerium cell. Operating at such high temperatures and power concentration severely stresses the construction materials of the cell, making the process less attractive.

A novel way out of this difficulty appeared to be the recovery of rare earth metal as an alloy that is molten at the electrolysis temperature. The alloy could thus be easily separated from the electrolyte. Metal was subsequently recove red from the alloy by pyrovacuum distilla- tion. This approach attracted a number of investigations and considerable success was achieved. The important investigat ions are listed in Table 4.15. 4.12.1 Electrolysis of Chlorides Considerable pioneering work on the electrow inning of rare earth metals from their molten chlorides using a liquid cadmium or zinc catho de was done by Trombe (1935, 1938, 1945) between 1935–1945. The cell arrangement for this purpose was similar to the one he had used for deposition of pure liquid metals ex cept that the cathode was a liquid metal. An electrolyte composed of 44% GdCl3, 44% KCl, and 12% LiCl with a liquid cadmium cathode was used. The bath temperature was held between 625 and 725°C and electrolytic current was maintained for 15 min. A cadmi um alloy containing 6% gadolinium was ob- tained. This alloy was heated in a vacuum to distill away cadmium. Gadolinium thus ob- tained was melted in a molybdenum crucible at 1240°C to form a semi-agglomerated mass, which was analyzed at 98.4% gadolinium and 0.7% silicon and cadmium. It was a small- scale experiment that used only a total of 4 g of electrolyte. Besides gadolinium, europium (Trombe 1938) and dysprosium (Trombe 1945) we re also prepared using cadmium as liquid cathode. A molten alkali chloride bath was used at 750°C to which praseodymium, yttrium,or samarium chlorides were added. The cathode was a liquid alloy of Mg–Cd. On electro- lysis, the liquid cathode collected the rare ea rth metal. The resulting alloy, which contained up to 35% rare earth metal, was vacuum di stilled to remove magnesium and cadmium. Of the three rare earths investigated, only samarium tended to distill together with magnesium.

Scandium was recovered after distilling off zinc. An equi- molar mixture of SmCl3–NaCl was electrolyzed at 500°C using a liquid zinc cathode, and a SmZn12 alloy was obtained (Ishikawa et al. 1974). Recently, Chambers and Murphy (1988) invest igated the fused salt electrolysis of neo- dymium from a chloride electrolyte using a liquid metal cathode. Even though it was possible to electrodeposit ne odymium into a liquid zinc cat hode, the current efficiencies averaged only 50% and zinc was dispersed throughout the electrolyte at all current densities. The mobility of zinc in the elect rolyte decreased during electrowinning between 500 and 600°C but current effi ciencies averaged only 40%. Using a temperature between 600 and 700°C also did not yield satisfactory results. At above 700°C, zinc readily mixed with the electrolyte leading to a very poor metal–salt separation at the end of electrolysis. These problems were circumvented by Chambe rs and Murphy (1988) by the use of Mg–Zn and Mg–Cd cathodes. The intermetallic compounds MgZn and Mg3Cd2 melt between 500 and 550°C, and these were used as cathodes. They used an electroly tic cell shown schema- tically in Figure 4.52. A recrystallized alumina crucible (55 mm diameter and 105 mm height) was the electrolyte container. The an ode was a 12-mm diameter graphite rod and an electrical connection to the liquid metal cat hode was made with a 6-mm diameter molyb- denum rod. Sheathing the anode and the molybde num current feeder with borosilicate glass tubes fixed the electrode surface area and enab led accurate control of the current density. The cell was heated externally by a furn ace and temperature was measured by a thermocouple sheathed with borosilicate glass and immersed in the molten metal cathode. The electrolyte was a 50:50 mole ratio mixture of NdCl3 and KCl eutectic composition, and its melting point was 480°C. The cell was operat ed at 650°C and electrolysis lasted for 4 h. In the end, the cell contents we re allowed to cool in the al umina crucible after which the crucible was broken and the alloy was se parated from the solidified electrolyte. Figure 4.52 Electrolysis cell for reduction of neodymium (Chambers and Murphy 1988). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 278 Neodymium was recovered from the cathode alloy by distillation. The apparatus used is shown in Figure 4.53. The alloy was contai ned in a molybdenum crucible placed inside a graphite condenser column. The column wa s placed in a bell jar that was evacuated. Distillation was carried out at 900°C and 0.1 Pa for 15 min followed by heating at 1100°C and 0.1 Pa for up to 30 min. Magnesium and zinc or cadmium were distilled off leaving behind neodymium in the molybdenum cruc ible. This was recovered by inverting the crucible and heating under a vacuum, allowing the molten neodymium to drip on to a cold copper hearth. Between the two liquid alloy cathodes Mg–Zn and Mg–Cd, Chambers and Murphy (1988) considered the Mg–Cd cathode better ev en though the current efficiency was only 80% as compared to 90% current efficien cy when the Mg–Zn cathode was used. The Mg–Cd–Nd alloy yielded purer neodymium product on vacuum distillation. Neodymium metal of 99.9+ purity was recovered from the Mg–Cd alloy cathode whereas about 2% zincpersisted in the neodymium recovered from the Mg–Zn alloy. Besides, the residual chlorine, carbon, and oxygen contents of th e neodymium product from vacuum distillation of the zinc alloy cathode were 100, 300, and 180 ppm, respectively, while the corres- ponding values for the product from the cadmi um alloy cathode were 30, 80, and 110 ppm. The Mg–Cd alloy resulted in a cleaner metal–salt separation than did the Mg–Zn alloy.The separation of the Mg–Cd alloy from ne odymium by vacuum distillation was achieved more readily than when zinc was involved. 4.12.2 Electrolysis of Oxide –Fluoride Melts The electrolytic reduction of rare earth oxide dissolved in a fluo ride melt to yield the alloy directly has also been investigated. In many cases the alloy can be distilled in vacuum to yield the pure metal as the condensate or as the residue. Two types of cathodes were used. In one type, the cathode was solid at the electr olysis temperature but formed a liquid alloy Figure 4.53 Vacuum distillation apparatus (Chambers and Murphy 1988). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 279 when the rare earth metal was deposited on it. In the other, the cathode was a metal or alloy that was already molten at the electrolysis te mperature and formed a molten alloy with the electrodeposited rare earth metal. When the cathode was solid, the temperature of electro- lysis was higher than the melting point of th e eutectic between the cathode and the rare earth metal but lower than the melting point of the cathode metal (Morrice et al. 1968, 1969). The combinations of rare earth and co nsumable cathodes investigated at Reno are shown in Figure 4.54 (Morrice 19 85). The electrolyte comprise d rare earth oxide dissolved in REF3–LiF–BaF2, and the cell arrangement is the same as that used for high purity metal preparation. Instead of Mo, a consumable rod of Fe, Ni, Cr, or Co is used as the cathode. Low melting near eutectic alloys of the rare earth and the cathode metal formed and dripped off during electrolysis at the working temperat ure of 850–1000°C and were collected at the cooled bottom of the cell in a solid form. Th e consumable cathode rod was lowered into the bath at a controlled rate and semicontinuous operation of the cell wa s achieved. The alloy could be tapped from the bottom spout after h eating the cell to sufficient temperature. The alloys contained about 80–90% REM. Even th e difficult to reduce samarium was obtained as Sm–13Fe alloy with about 46% current effi ciency, principally because alloy formation effectively prevented back reaction of samari um with the fluoride which results in the formation of Sm(II). Morrice et al. (1969) investigated the electrodepo sition–vacuum distillation process for the preparation of gadolinium, dysprosi um, yttrium, and samarium. As high purity liquid metals, the first three are difficult to electrowin because of their high melting points (>1300°C). At the requisite cell operating temp eratures (<1400°C), there will be increased carbon contamination of the product. Even though samarium has a comparatively low melting point (1072°C), direct electrowinni ng of the metal was unsatisfactory because of its reactivity with the electrolyte (Morrice et al. 1968). Electrowinning of these metals as alloys circumvented these problems. Morrice et al. (1969) chose manganese and chromium as alloying elements for gadolinium, mangan ese for yttrium, and iron for samarium and dysprosium, on the basis of phase diagram in formation of the corresponding binary alloys and the vapor pressures. The eutectics of the bi nary systems contain about 75 to 95% of the rare earth metal and, except in the case of ga dolinium–chromium, the eutectic temperatures were low enough to permit cell operation in the temperature range of 900 to 1000°C. Figure 4.54 Combinations of rare earths and consum able anodes in the electrolytic prepa- ration of alloys (Morrice 1985). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 280 The cell used by Morrice et al. (1969) for the electrodeposition of gadolinium, dysprosium, samarium, and yttrium with ma nganese, chromium, or iron is shown in Figure 4.55. The graphite crucible for holding the molten electrolyte had an inside diameter of 100 mm and a depth of 100 mm. The anodes were two 18 mm diameter fluted graphite rods. The cathode was a 5 to 6.5 mm diameter iron or chromium metal rod or a 15 mm diameter as melted manganese metal bar. The cell was enclosed in an inert gas chamber to avoid atmosphere contamination. Glove and vi ew ports in the chamber permitted addition of cell feed and allowed the ra ising and lowering of the electrodes during operation. The electrolytes for the electrodeposition of gadolinium–manganese, gadolinium– chromium, dysprosium–iron, and yttrium manganese alloys contained 50 mol % rare earthfluoride and 50 mol % lithium fluoride. Th e electrolyte for the electrodeposition of samarium–iron alloy contained 25 mol % SmF 3 and 75 mol % LiF. The solubilities of rare earth oxides in the electrolyte are between 2 and 4 wt %. In the beginning, melting of the electrolyte was started from the top by striking an arc between two tungsten rods. Subsequently th e cell was internally heated by applying AC Figure 4.55 Rare earth–ferroalloy electrodeposition cell (Morrice et al. 1969). 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 281 between the graphite anodes. For electrolysis, DC was applied to the anode and cathode. The rare earth metal was electrodeposited on the manganese, chromium, and iron cathode to form a low melting alloy. Th e alloy, as it formed, drippe d off, the cathode penciled down, and a new section of the cathode was lowere d into the electrolyte. The molten alloy descended and collected at the bottom of the cell, where a skull of frozen electrolyte prevented graphite contamination of the all oy. After completion of the experiment, the electrolyte was allowed to freeze, and alloy nodules weighing 2 to 75 grams each were recovered. The operational data for electrodep osition of the various alloys are given in Table 4.16. The next step of the process, vacuum dist illation, was carried out by Morrice et al. (1969) in the apparatus shown in Figure 4.56. In the distillation apparatus, the alloy sample was contained in a 25 mm diameter by 25 mm deep tungsten crucible having a wall thickness of 1.6 mm. The crucible was placed on a 6 mm thick molybdenum disk and was surrounded by two concentric radiation sh ields made from a molybdenum sheet. This assembly was supported by a zirconia plate on top of a quartz pedestal. To collect the distilled metal, a tantalum condenser wa s placed above the crucible. The apparatus including the induction furnace for heating the sample was enclosed in a Pyrex bell jar chamber that could be evacuated to 6.6 ×10–5 Pa. The crucible and condenser temperatures were measured using thermocouples.

Pure samarium and dysprosium meta ls distilled off from the iron alloy and collected in the condenser. They were separated from the co llector by peeling away the tantalum. Gado- linium and yttrium, being less volatile than the alloying constituent s chromium or manga- nese, remained as residue in the crucible whil e the alloying constituent distilled off. After completion of experiment, the crucible contai ning these metals was inverted and the metals melted under vacuum on to a water cooled copp er hearth. The details of distillation, starting alloy, and final product analyses are summari zed in Table 4.17. After distillation, gado- linium, samarium, and yttrium contained less than 0.02% of ferrous metal. Distillation did not effectively separate dysprosium from iron and high purity dysprosium was not obtained. The difference in vapor pressure between Dy and DyF3 was not sufficient for effective separation of dysprosium from the fluoride impurity, either. The method described above for a consumable solid cathode cannot be used to prepare alloys composed of yttrium and low melting co nstituents such as magnesium, aluminum, or zinc. A suitable method for these was de scribed by Aamland et al. (1973). The method consisted of electroreduction of Y2O3 dissolved in molten YF3–LiF electrolyte and subsequent deposition of yttrium in a floa ting magnesium cathode. The process was carried out in a specially designed MgO diaphragm cell at a temperature ranging from 780 to 970°C. The product alloys, prepared in batche s of ~20 g contained up to 55% yttrium. The cathode current efficiencies were 21 to 60%. The purity of the alloy was comparable to that obtained by metallothermic reduction. On di stillation in vacuum, these alloys yielded yttrium metal comparable in purity (0.1 to 0.2% oxygen content) to that obtained by distillation of metallothermic alloys. Besides Mg, molten aluminum was also used as cathode in the preparation of yttrium– aluminum alloy (Al–20Y) using an electrolyte of Y2O3 in YF3–LiF (Bratland et al. 1972, 1973). Yttrium–aluminum alloy of approx imately eutectic composition (91% Y) was electrowon from a mixture of yttria and alumina dissolved in a YF3–LiF melt (Morrice et al. 1968). This cell used liquid Y–A l cathode and a graphite anode. 4.13 CURRENT EFFICIENCY Current efficiency in the electrolytic cells described here are determined by several factors. The current efficiency of commercial chloride cells is low, usually below 50%. At the temperature of electrolysis (~900°C), the rare earth metals can react with O2, H2, CO2, and graphite, forming products with low electrical conductivity and a high melting point. The presence of oxychlorides, either from the st arting material or by reaction between the trichloride and moisture, is detrimental to the electrolytic process. Oxychlorides have higher melting points than the anhydrous halide s and limited solubility in the latter. Their existence causes an increase in viscosity in th e molten salt leading to current losses because of lower ionic mobility and a higher temperature for bath operation. The presence and accumulation of multival ent elements such as Sm, Eu, and other nonreducible components in the electrolyte al so lead to lower current efficiency. SmCl3 can easily react with Sm, more readily at high er temperatures, to form soluble divalent chlorides. During electrolysis the oxidation–reduction reaction of Sm3+–Sm2+ can occur cyclically at anode and cathode and cause hi gh current consumption and low efficiency.04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 284 Table 4.17 Operational data for distillation of alloys containing rare earth and ferrous metals, and analysis of starting alloys and final products (Morrice et al. 1969) AlloyDistillation parameters RE recovered, %Analyses, % Duration, hDistillation temperature, °CCondenser temperature, °CAl Ca C F Fe Mg O Si Ta Dy–16Fe 2 1300 1095 75 Alloy Distillate<0.01 <0.01<0.003<0.0030.0240.0020.260.2116.2 0.0080.003 <0.0010.0300.0210.005 <0.005<0.02<0.02 Sm–13Fe 3 1000 700 85 Alloy Distillate<0.01<0.01<0.003<0.0030.0490.0100.580.0313.0 0.0050.0300.0010.0500.0150.010 <0.002<0.02<0.02 Al Ca C Cr F Mn O Si W Gd–6Cr 3 1350 * 95 Alloy Residue<0.01 <0.01<0.003<0.0030.0250.0206.20.10.48 <0.002<0.003<0.0030.0270.0300.0040.008<0.01<0.01 Gd–34Mn 0.5 1350 * 96 Alloy Residue<0.01 <0.01<0.003<0.0030.0300.0500.0050.0040.390.01833.7 <0.0030.0190.0200.0040.010<0.01<0.01 Y–37Mn 0.1 1550 * 93 Alloy Residue<0.01<0.01<0.003<0.0030.0450.0500.0040.0040.350.00337.0 0.0030.0200.0600.0050.003<0.01 0.3504 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 285 The current efficiencies of molten fluori de systems are better and range from 75 to 95% (Hirschhorn 1968). The fluoride electrolysis investigations, however, have been conducted using high pure starting material s in inert atmosphere electrolytic cells. Morrice (1985) has commented that low cathode current efficiency could result from reaction of the metal product with the electro lyte and poor coalescence of the electrowon metals. More efficient cell designs to pr ovide cathodic protection and prevent metal products from being contaminated, and the dete rmination of the effects of electrolysis tem- perature and melt composition have also b een suggested by him as a means of improving current efficiency. In addition to low current efficiency, Morrice (1985) had listed anode effect, metal and alloy product contamination, corrosion of cell components, and efficient heat utilization in the cell as areas that need research attention in the molten salt electro- winning of yttrium metals and alloys. 4.14 SUMMARY Rare earth metals are among those metals that are considered to be mo st difficult to produce in pure form. Several processes have been de veloped for the production of rare earth metals of different purities. These include: (i) reduct ion of anhydrous chlorides or fluorides, (ii) reduction of rare earth oxides, and (iii) fuse d salt electrolysis of rare earth chlorides or oxide–fluoride mixtures. A qualitative picture as to which reactive element is usable as a reducing agent for rare earth metals prepar ation is obtained from the free energies of formation of the oxides, fluorides, and chlori des and their dependence on temperature. The data for rare earths and some potential reduci ng agents indicate that in the oxide systems, the order of stability is CaO > RE2O3 > MgO > Al2O3 >> SiO2; whereas among the fluorides it is CaF2 > REF3 > LiF > NaF > MgF2 >> AlF3; and among the chlorides, KCl > NaCl ≈ CaCl2 > RECl3 > MgCl2 >> AlCl3. The indicated order of stabilities, however, can be changed in real systems by changing the activities of one or mo re of the reactants or products. When no such change is effected, th e above data indicate that calcium is the only choice for the reduction of rare earth oxide s and fluorides, whereas chlorides can also effectively be reduced by lithium, sodium, or potassium. Thermodynamic feasibility is at best the first of many factors that determine the practicability of the reduction process. Con- sideration of the other factors, including the melting point of calcia slag and exothermicity of the reaction, indicated that calciothermic re duction of rare earth oxides is not a suitable process for rare earth metal preparation. It had to be the halide route. Rare earth metals are highly reactive, particul arly at the high temperatures required for their preparation. The halide reduction, which usually involves the metallothermic reduction of pure anhydrous halides with pure metallic reductants, is a standard method of reactive metals preparation and is meant to be an oxygen free process. However, oxygenand other interstitial impurities such as carbo n and nitrogen do find entry into the reduced metal in various ways. This is traceable to th e extreme stability of the solutions and com- pounds formed by these elements with rare earth metals. While this cannot be avoided, it can certainly be minimized by suitable choice of container materials and by carrying out all the operations in a contro lled environment system. The methods for producing rare earth metals by chloride reduction processes are sum- marized in Figure 4.57. Starting from rare earth oxide, the process basically involves two stages. In the first, anhydrous rare earth trichl oride is prepared, and in the second stage the04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 286 trichloride is reduced to the metal. The olde st and most widely used process for chloride preparation is the wet route. Rare earth trichloride hexahydrate is crystallized from a HCl solution of rare earth oxide. The hydrated chlo ride is then dehydrated by heating under dry HCl flow under reduced pressure. Alternativel y, dry methods such as chlorination of the oxide by heating with ammonium chloride or ch lorination of the oxide or even the rare earth ore concentrate by heating with carbon under chlorine flow have also been used. The chloride can be purified by distillation. The pr incipal reducing agents for rare earth trichlo- ride are calcium and lithium. Calcium reducti on has been used at Ames for the production of low melting lanthanides La, Ca, Pr, and also Nd and Gd. For gadolinium and highermelting rare earths, using a higher react ion temperature was complicated by CaCl 2 slag frothing and bomb liner attack. Tantalum cruc ibles were useful. Reduction of rare earth chloride with lithium has been successfully us ed for most of the rare earths. In the USBM process, the chloride and lithium were heated together in a molybdenum crucible under inert atmosphere. In the Ames process as well as in the commercial process, lithium vapor reduction of rare earth trichloride could yi eld yttrium and other high melting rare earth metals. Tantalum was used as a container. Th e LiCl slag was removed by vacuum distil- lation. The use of rare earth fluorides as intermed iates for reduction to metal circumvents the problems associated with the use of hygrosco pic and volatile chlorides. Purer metals are obtained in this elegant process. The me thods are summarized in Figure 4.58. Out of the three major alternatives for converting the rare earth oxide to rare earth fluoride, Figure 4.57 Processes for the preparation of rare earth metals through the chlorides.04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 287 hydrofluorination at 700°C has been used to prepare the purest fluorides. The Ames process is the technically perfect method for conversion of the fluoride to metal. In this method the rare earth fluoride and calcium loaded in a ta ntalum crucible are externally heating in an argon atmosphere to about 50°C above the melt ing point of the highest melting component of the reaction mixture. The reaction goes to completion in a few minutes resulting in good slag–metal separation. The excess calcium a nd adhering slag are removed from the metal by vacuum melting, and high purity metal is obtained in 97–99% yield. Any rare earth metal, independent of its melting point, except Sm, Eu, and Yb, which form stable divalent halides, can be reduced to metal by this proces s. Lithium is the only other reductant that has been found to be quite effective, but less than calcium. An important variant of the process, particularly for yttrium, is to conduct the re duction in the presence of magnesium at a low temperature. Magnesium is removed from the Y–Mg alloy by vacuum distillation and the yttrium sponge vacuum melted. A limitation of th e fluoride route is the high cost of fluorine chemicals, which end up as low value calcium fluoride. Even though samarium, europium, and ytterbium cannot be produced by halide reduction, their oxides can be directly redu ced to metal in a process that exploits the pronounced volatility of these metals. The technique is quite similar to that used by Pidgeon for magnesium. Lanthanum is among th e least volatile of the rare earth metals. Besides, La2O3 has one of the most negative values fo r its heat of formation. In the process, an intimate mixture of lanthanum chips and rare earth oxide is heated in a tantalum crucible fitted with a long tantalum condenser. Lant hanum reduces the rare earth oxide and the rare earth metal produced, being volatile, escapes and collects in the condenser. Metal yield is higher. Certain metals such as cerium, misc h metal, zirconium, a nd thorium, which are Figure 4.58 Processes for the preparation of rare earth metals through the fluorides.04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 288 similar in the relevant characteristics to lant hanum, have also been used in its place. The process is shown in Figure 4.59 along with certain other specific oxide reduction methods. A relatively new entrant to the field of metallothermic rare earth production methods is the process of molten salt reduction ex traction, developed at General Motors. The reduction is carried out by reacting the Nd2O3 with calcium in a molten salt bath (CaCl2–NaCl) and simultaneously extracting the reduced metal into a molten Nd–Zn or Nd–Fe alloy. The Nd–Zn alloy product is treate d in a vacuum to remove zinc and produce Nd metal. The process has been made commercially more attractive by the use of sodium instead of calcium as the reducing agent. The electrolytic methods currently account for the largest quantity of rare earth metals commercially produced throughout the worl d. Lanthanum, cerium, and praseodymium have melting points that permit their recovery in a liquid state by elect rolysis of inexpensive fused chlorides at temperatures less than 1100 °C. Winning of the rare earth elements in the liquid state facilitates slag (electrolyte)–me tal separation, minimizes contamination of the reduced metal and enables continuous operatio n and high volume levels of production. Such electrolytic processes are inherently simpler and cheaper compared to complex metallothermic reduction procedures. The t echnical feasibility of preparing limited quantities of high melting rare earth metals such as gadolinium, dy sprosium, and yttrium in addition to neodymium, praseodymium, and didymium (Nd + Pr) in a consolidated form has also been demonstrated by using the fluo rides as electrolytes in place of chlorides. These studies have been carried out in spec ially designed high temperature cells that can operate up to 1700°C. For cerium and lanthanu m, cells have been designed and operated at U.S. Bureau of Mines for continuous prod uction of these metals by oxide–fluoride electrolysis. Instead of as pure metals, if the rare earth metals are recovered as binary alloys having melting points in the range 600–1000° C, the electrolytic process has been found applicable to all the rare earth metals with the added advantages of liquid metal recovery Figure 4.59 Processes for the preparation of ra re earth metals by oxide reduction. 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMREDUCTION 289 and low temperature operation. Besides, by this process, all the rare earth metals, including those with stable divalency, could be recovere d as alloys. If a relatively more volatile metal such as cadmium, zinc, or magnesium is used as the alloying component with a relatively less volatile high melting rare earth, e.g., ne odymium, gadolinium, and yttrium, the alloy can be vacuum distilled to pure metal. The question of a technically perfect reduction process for rare earth metal preparation was answered as early as the 1950s and 19 60s with the development of the fluoride reduction process and the lanthanothermic di rect reduction process at Ames. But these processes are expensive because of the high co st of chemicals, the expense of the reactor, and the batch nature of the process. The same may be said of electrolytic processes except those for the recovery of lanthanum, cerium, and praseodymium in a chloride bath. The highly effective oxide–fluoride electrolysis has problems of high temperature operation, corrosion, low solubility of oxides in molten fluoride, and limitations on current density to avoid affecting the anode. The field remains open for improvement and new processes that are easy on costs yet provide adequate purity in the final metal product. 04 Chapter 4 195-29 0.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:44 PMCHAPTER 5 Refining Rare Earth Metals 5.1 INTRODUCTION As-reduced rare earth metals, whether produ ced metallothermically or by fused salt electrowinning, are generally 98 to 99% pure. It is usually possible in certain cases, if care is taken to use pure raw materials and adopt controlled environment processing, to restrict the total impurities in the as-reduced metals to about 0.5%. More often than not this additional gain in purity is either not tech nically possible or involves a great increase in process cost, especially in commercial s cale operations. The general alternative to improving or modifying the reduction technique itself is first to prepare even a relatively impure metal by a commercially viable re duction method and follow it by a suitable refining procedure. This is important because fairly good grade rare earth metals with purity adequate for many application requir ements are usually available at reasonable prices, and the metal that qualifies as ultr apure for one application could be impure for another application. This also highlights the need for customizing the refining procedure for a particular application, with commercial metals as source material. The refining step is, therefore, a necessary and important oper ation in the extractive flowsheet of the rare earth metals. A number of processes are used for refini ng the as-reduced rare earth metals to different levels of purity. The nature and con centration of the impurity to be removed and the final purity level desired in the refined metal generally govern the refining technique that should be used. In the case of rare earth metals, the applicable processes are strongly influenced by the melting points of the metals and their vapor pressure at the melting point. This influence is clearly brought out in Figu re 5.1 which depicts the generalized sequence of processes for purification of rare earth metals (Gupta and Krishnamurthy 1992). Complete purification is not achieved by any one refining technique and, as a rule, a sequence of processes has to be applied to remove all the impurities (Jones et al. 1982). The usefulness of a given technique in th e near complete removal of one or more impurities from rare earths is a necessary but not a sufficient criterion for its adoption for large scale or commercial operations. The t echnique has to be compatible with other demands such as product form, metal yield, batch size, operational simplicity, and eco- nomics. On the other hand, in the choice of a technique for small volu me metal refining for research purposes, major emphasis is placed on the ultimate purity achievable and conside- rations such as yield and economics become secondary. 05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 292 This chapter gives a description of rare eart h metal refining processes. It opens with a reference to the origin of various impurities usually associated with as-reduced rare earth metals. Refining by pyrovacuum treatments like vacuum melting, vacuum distillation, and sublimation is then detailed. Fused salt elect rorefining has not been applied extensively to rare earth metal refining. The same is true of the iodide or the Van Arkel–de Boer process. Ultrapurification of rare earth metals has b een an important operation for certain applica- tions. This is usually carried out by zone refini ng and its many variations as well as by solid state electrotransport and its variations. The ch oice of a particular technique, as mentioned earlier, is strongly determined not only by the impurity to be removed, but also by the physi- cal properties of the rare earth metal, part icularly its melting point and vapor pressure. Unlike the chemical properties of rare earth s, which are well known for their close simi- larity, the physical properties vary significantl y among the rare earths (Gschneidner et al. 1995). This is reflected in the applicable techniques for rare earth metal refining and ultrapurification. 5.2 ORIGIN OF IMPURITIES It may be recalled and briefly referred to here that the methods useful for rare earth metal production are high temperature controlled atmo sphere reduction of halides, either the an- hydrous chlorides or fluorides by reductants su ch as calcium or lithium; fused salts electro- lysis of chlorides or oxide–fluoride mixtur es; direct reduction of oxides by lanthanum, Figure 5.1 Processes for the purification of rare earth metals. 05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 293 cerium, zirconium, or even misch metal; and finally, certain special reduction procedures in molten salts. As-reduced rare earth metals obtained by the above processes are pure enough for certain applications but need further purification for many other applications. Depending on the raw material used and the pro cess adopted, the type and level of impurities in the rare earths vary. Besides, the rare earth metals themselves, because of their inherent characteristics, are selective in picking up certain impurities more than others. While careful control of rare material purity and process variables will enable preparation of metal that is 99.99+% pure in respect to other metallic atoms, the situation is very different for nonmetallic impurities su ch as oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, and halides. To get metal better than 99.9% by we ight pure with regard to all elements is an extremely challenging task. The rare earths ge tter nonmetallic elements and they creep into the metal at all stages of manufacture or handlin g. In addition, these el ements, even in small quantities, when in solid solution influence to a significant extent the properties of indivi- dual rare earth metals. In the as-reduced rare earth metals the im purities principally come from the starting materials and the environment in which the pro cess is carried out. The best way to produce the pure metals is to prepare them in such a ma nner that the impurities do not get into the system. This is best done by producing the re actants in an ultrapure form and keeping the system free at all times from atmospheric ga ses and adsorbed impurities — a task not always feasible because of technical and/ or economic reasons. Any loose nonmetallic elements present in the container materials or on the inner surfaces of the reactor will invariably end up in the metal. 5.2.1 Starting Materials In the as-reduced metals, the metallic impurit ies to be considered first are the metallic reductant and any metal added to the charge to form a low melting alloy. A reaction consti- tuent when used in excess of the stoichiometr ic amount can end up as an impurity. Calcium, lithium, lanthanum, cerium, zi rconium, and thorium impuriti es are all examples in this context. Magnesium and zinc impurities origin ate from adding alloy constituent. A reaction constituent also ends up as an impurity in the event of incomplete reduction. The presence of residual fluorine or chlori ne and residual oxygen in the metal are some examples. The amount of fluorine that remains in the as-re duced metal prepared by fluoride reduction, however, is not the same as the amount of re sidual chlorine when the metal is obtained by chloride reduction. For exampl e, when Dy, Ho, and Er are pr epared by calcium reduction of rare earth fluorides, the metal invariably contains 25–75 ppm fluorine impurity. On the other hand, when these metals are prepared by lithium reduction of their anhydrous chlorides, the chlorine contents in the as-r educed metals are very low, namely, < 3 ppm (Croat 1969). In electrolytic reduction of rare earth metals, for example, the impurities to be anticipated are lithium, fluorine, and oxyge n. Lithium and fluorine result from the melt and oxygen comes from the rare earth oxide st arting material. Reaction constituents can be the source of impurities in another way also. The impurities present in the compound inter- mediate or reductant are often quantitatively transferred to the as-reduced metal. For a long time and until the modern separa tion methods of ion exchange and solvent extraction were developed for effectively separating the rare earths from one another, one of the difficult problems was to get the rare earth oxide that is pure with respect to all the other rare earths. Using ion exchange, it is poss ible to get one rare earth so pure that all05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 294 other rare earths together amount to less th an 10 ppm (Spedding et al. 1970). Solvent extraction methods also can provide such puri ty in many cases. It should, however, be pointed out that once a certain am ount of other rare earth impurity is allowed to be present in the rare earth oxide, it will end up in th e metal and usually none of the post-reduction purification techniques are particularly eff ective in removing these impurities, and they will remain essentially unchanged in the purified metal. Commercial chemicals frequently used in so lvent extraction and ion exchange can be the source of certain metallic impurities foun d in the rare earth oxides. Lead and calcium are examples. Impurities such as iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper enter the process stream as a result of a chemical attack on reactor mate rials, such as stainless steel, and end up in the rare earth oxide. Redissolution of this oxide and reprecipitation using very pure chemicals and very pure water usually lead to substantial purification of the oxide from these impurities. Conversion of highly purified oxides to anhydrous fluorides or chlorides is another stage where impurities can get easily introd uced. Hydrogen fluoride (HF) is a very corrosive gas and it can attack the metals of construction, forming volatile fluorides. These lead to introduction of impurities such as moly bdenum or iron into the rare earth fluorides. Oxyfluorides and oxychlorides are readily form ed by the fluorides and chlorides, and a good part of whatever oxygen is there in the halides will end up in the metal. Among the many methods used for fluoride pr eparation, hydrofluorination by reaction between the rare earth oxide and HF can yiel d the purest product. After preparing the fluoride in the powder form by passing HF over the oxide, in a practice followed at Ames, the fluoride was subjected to a process know n as topping to get rid of any trace oxy- compounds (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978). It was subsequently found (Beaudry et al. 1983) that the oxygen contents of metals pr epared from topped and untopped fluorides was nearly the same, particularly for light rare earths. Metallic impurities such as Cu, Ni, Fe, Cr, and Si, which remain in the fluoride after low temperature hydrofluorination, were reduced in the topping process. Topping is not done in commercial practices. The fluorides prepared by the aqueous methods have been fo und to have slightly higher oxygen contents than the fluorides prepared by hydrofluorinat ion. However, the preparation of fluoride by precipitation of REF3 from an aqueous solution using 48% HF or by the reaction of RE2O3 with NH4HF2 are simpler methods and also are useful if certain impurities can be tolerated in the final product. Impurities such as Al, Fe, and Cu are introduced from the NH4HF2 (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978). Once very pure fluorides have been prepared , they must not be exposed to air because they will react with moisture in the air and form oxyfluoride an d will also pick up some air and carbon dioxide. The hygroscopi city of chlorides is more than that of the fluorides and they also have a strong tendency to form ox ychlorides. The best fluorides prepared at Ames contain considerably less than 20 parts per million (ppm) oxygen and less than 10 ppm metallic impurities (Spedding et al. 1970). The impurity levels in the interprocess intermediate, for example, the rare earth fluoride, that can be tolerated for producing metal of certain purity also depend on the process used for reduction. For obtaining low im purity levels in the product, the method of preparing fluoride for use in the electrolytic re duction is not as critical as for the calcium reduction technique (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978). Similar observations were made by Gray (1951) concerning cerium chloride for metallothermic reduction and cerium chloride for electrolytic reduction. In a calcium reduction, the oxygen content of fluoride is quite critical because any oxide present in the fluoride will end up in the metal. It is not so in05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 295 electrolytic reduction. In ox ide–fluoride electrolysis, CeO2 or Ce2O3, for example, is added to the fluoride melt and it is the oxid e that undergoes reduction to the metal. The fluoride melt can actually extract oxygen and cer tain impurities such as C, N, F, Mg, and Ni (Carlson et al. 1960). Thus in the electrolytic preparation, it may be anticipated that the long contact time of the metal with the fluoride flux may decrease the level of some impurities in the metal. However, a fluoride flux well loaded or saturated with impurities from the previous runs can also pass on some impurities to the metal. In the electrolytic preparation of ceriu m, the method of preparation of CeF3 influences the purity of the metal obtained. Preparation of the fluoride using NH4HF2 introduced impurities such as Al, Fe, and Cu from the bi fluoride, and these impurities showed up in the metal. The preparation of CeF3 by reaction of the oxide w ith anhydrous HF might lower the levels of these impurities in the metal. In the same way as impurities in the inte rprocess intermediates can end up in the metal, impurities contained in the reductan t can also find themselves in the as-reduced metal. Calcium is the most important reduc ing agent for metallothermic reduction of fluorides, and its purity is an important parameter (Spedding et al. 1968). Even the triply distilled commercial calcium invariably co ntains several hundred ppm oxygen, and when this calcium is exposed to air even for a very short period of time the oxygen content in it will increase to several thousand ppm. It is therefore very necessary to reprocess (distill) calcium just before using and keep it sealed from the atmosphere until use. At Ames, for best results, calcium is sublimed at a low temperature (825°C) under a few millimeters of helium. With such care, calcium containing 10 to 30 ppm oxygen could be produced. Another impurity in calcium is carbon. Abou t 100 ppm carbon persists in the distilled calcium and a part of this carbon will ultim ately come into the metal (Spedding et al. 1970). Even while using lithium as reductant great care has to be taken, as was done for calcium because commercial lithium invariab ly contains more oxygen than what is acceptable. 5.2.2 Crucible The materials of construction of the crucible and the reactor in which the metal is prepared come into close contact with the metal and can end up as impurities. A reduction carried out in a tantalum crucible results in an aver age of 0.05% tantalum in the as-reduced metal (Huffine and Williams 1961). This concentratio n can be much higher if reduction is carried out at higher temperatures or for longer periods of time. Tantalum crucible was used by Croat (1969) in the preparation of Dy, Ho , and Er. These metals were prepared, as described in the previous chapter, by the reduction of their anhydrous chlorides with lithium as reductant. The temperature of re duction was 900°C, which was well below the melting point of these metals. The tantalum contamination of as-reduced Dy, Ho, and Er was quite low, i.e., <30 ppm. This can be c ontrasted with the tantalum content of 0.1 to 0.2% which Dy, Ho, and Er have in their as -reduced from when they were obtained by calcium reduction of their fluorides in tantal um crucibles. It may be recalled that these reductions are carried out at high temperatur es, above the melting point of the rare earth metals. Daane (1961) stated that because the solubili ty of tantalum in liquid rare earth metals increased measurably with increasing temperat ure, the lowest possible temperature is used in the processes wherein the rare earth metal is processed in contact with tantalum, in order05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 296 to keep the tantalum impurity as low as poss ible. In the reduction of the light rare earth metals (lanthanum through neodymium), the am ount of tantalum in the metal is approxi- mately 200 to 300 ppm. For higher melting heavy rare eart hs and yttrium, this figure increases to about 1000 to 5000 ppm. Among th e rare earth metals, tantalum is the most soluble in scandium. As much as 3% tantalum is present in scandium melted in tantalum. As far as dissolution is concerne d, tungsten is better as a crucib le material. In the liquid rare earth metals, less tungsten dissolves than does tantalum at any temperature (Dennison et al. 1966, 1966a). The refractory metals molybde num, niobium, titanium, and zirconium are distinctly more soluble in molten rare eart h metals than are tantalum and tungsten. In reduction procedures where an alloying element is used to lower the melting point of the as-reduced metal (for example magnesium in yttrium reduction), titanium or zirco- nium may be used as crucibles. When yttr ium–magnesium alloy is reduced in titanium crucibles, the alloy picked up an average of 0.15% titanium, and when zirconium was used the pickup was 0.58% zirconium (Huffine and Williams 1961). In the electrolytic preparation of the ra re earth metals, cell corrosion can occur extensively and the corrosion products can end up in the metal produced. Carbon impurity in the electrolytically produced metals usua lly comes from graphite anode and/or cell walls (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978). Besides carbon, depending on the materials used for cell construction, the metals may be contaminat ed with iron, silicon, and other metallic impurities. The use of Mo as a liner or for th e crucible in the cell leads to pickup of the element in the electrolytic metal. Electroly tic cerium metal obtained using Mo as cell material showed a Mo level of >750 ppm. Th e use of Ta in place of Mo lowered Mo conta- mination in the metal and Ta was also no t picked up significantly (Shedd et al. 1964). Experiments at Ames have indicated that even tantalum can be a source of certain interstitial impurities (Beaudry and Palmer 19 74). Gadolinium prepared using topped fluo- ride and high purity calcium, with the reactan ts and products handled in an inert atmos- phere, showed less C, O, and N contents when W was used as crucible than when Ta was used as the crucible. 5.2.3 Environment A major source of interstitial impurities in the rare earth metals can be the atmosphere used to handle the starting materials and products . This was clearly brought out by the results given by Beaudry and Palmer (1974) for cerium. A batch of cerium was prepared from topped fluoride and high purity calcium, with the reactants and products handled under purified helium. The residual impurity conten t was (in ppm), O (15), N (40), H (3), C (15), and F (14). When the metal was prepared from topped fluorides and high purity calcium but handled in air, it contained O (350), N (20), H (10), C (75), and F (20). Many non- metallic interstitial impurities have their orig in in the processing atmosphere, which, inci- dentally, is the factor to be closely monito red and controlled even during the refining processes designed for elimination of impurities from the as-reduced metals. 5.3 METHODS FOR IMPURITY REMOV AL Impurities once present in the metal can be removed by a variety of techniques (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978). Two major types of pr ocesses can be distinguished. In one, the05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 297 impurities and the metal are separated from each other, and in the other type the impurities are not completely separated from the metal but are only redistributed so that one physical portion of the metal is substantially purer than the other portion. The first process usually involves the description of purification me thods, and starting from an as-reduced metal, which may be rather crude, they produce a pure metal, eliminating in the process several key impurities. The second type of process usually belongs to the category of ultrapuri- fication methods and starts from a pure metal an d converts it to an ultrapure metal. Often the ultrapurification methods work to remove certain impurities introduced into the metal during the purification process. Both in purif ication and ultrapurification, a high vacuum or ultra high vacuum is used as the envir onment, not only for preventing atmospheric impurities from coming into contact with th e metal undergoing refining, but also to effect removal of impurities from the metal. In ultrap urification, an inert gas effectively equal in purity to high or ultrahigh vacuum is used for certain metals for specific reasons. Gene- rally, however, a vacuum is the natural accomp animent to high temperature in metal purifi- cation processes broadly termed as pyrovacuum treatments, which begin with vacuum melting as the first and major step for all but th e four most volatile rare earth metals. Purifi- cation of the volatile rare earth metals is effected by another pyrovacuum treatment,vacuum sublimation. 5.4 PYROV ACUUM TREATMENTS Pyrovacuum treatments are the most important and effective means available for the purifi- cation of rare earth metals with respect to mo st of the impurities. The process essentially involves heating of the rare earth metal to te mperatures up to or above its melting point, under high vacuum. Heating under vacuum at hi gh temperatures is also necessary in certain purification procedures where the purificatio n occurs not exclusively because of high temperature and low pressure but because of ot her reasons. Examples are the techniques of zone melting and solid state electrotransport. These are ge nerally not grouped as pyro- vacuum treatments. Techniques that are called pyrovacuum refining treatments or simply pyrovacuum treatments are those where purification occurs because the impurity vaporizes leaving behind the metal, or the metal itself vaporizes leaving behind the impurity. In rare earths refining, the first process occurs in techniques grouped as vacuum melting even though the impurities are disti lled off. The second process o ccurs in techniques grouped as vacuum sublimation or vacuum distillation. The term vacuum distillation appears to be specifically reserved for processes involving th e distillation of the desired metal. During vacuum melting a variety of processes occur that contribute to rare earth refining. Theprincipal mechanisms are simple distillatio n (of the impurity), degassing, and certain complex deoxidation reactions. 5.4.1 Distillation Metallic impurities usually present in as-reduced rare earth metals are calcium, magnesium, iron, nickel, silicon, aluminum , chromium, copper, titanium, molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten, and zirconium. When the rare earth metal is subjected to heating/melting under high vacuum, some of these elements simply distill away while others do not. Which of the elements will distill and to what extent they would be so05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 298 removed depend upon the partial pressures of the impurity metals over the metal/melt. The vapor pressures of pure rare earth metals and al so of the impurity metals (Hultgren et al. 1973) are plotted in Figure 5.2. Even at the highest temperature (1850°C) used for vacuum melting of the rare earth metal (Spedding et al. 1968, Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978), among the impurity metals listed, only Ca, Mg , Fe, Si, and Al are more volatile than the least volatile rare earth metals. Nickel and all the refractory metals are substantially less volatile than the rare earth metals. Because impurities are usually present as a dilute solution in the rare earth metals, their partia l pressure over the rare earth metals will be considerably less. Taking this into account, the vaporization rate of the impurity element, i, Gi, may be approximated by the following free evaporation equation (Alcock 1976): Gi = 44.32 Si g cm–2 sec–1 when the impurity i is vaporizing from a solution in which its mole fraction is Xi and activity coefficient is γi, Gi is given by Gi = 44.32 SiγiXi g cm–2 sec–1 Here is the vapor pressure of the pure impurity element i in atmospheres, at the temperature considered, Si is the vaporization coefficient, which may be equated to 1 as a first approximation, M is the molecular weight of the evaporating species, and T is the temperature in K at which the evaporation is considered. Even though is more, a low Figure 5.2 Vapor pressures of rare earth and certain impurity elements. pi0MA/T pi0MA/T pi0 pi005 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 299 value of Xi and γi would seriously limit the vaporizatio n rate. So unless the vapor pressure of the impurity element is quite high, so that pi (= γiXi) and hence Gi will be substantial at the vacuum melting temperature, no signifi cant refining with respect to the impurity will occur by vacuum melting. These criteria rest rict the metallic elements removable from rare earth metals by vacuum meltin g to Fe, Cu, Al, Mg, and Ca. The vapor pressures of the rare earth metals are higher or at best of the same order of magnitude as those of the refractory metal im purities. Hence the separation of rare earth metals from these impurities by distilling off th e impurities is ruled out. Instead, there is a good possibility of the rare earth metal being distilled off leaving behind the impurities in the residue. This situation arises because of high and hence GRE, forming the basis of rare earth metal purification by distillation. It is entirely possible that the more vola tile impurities are first removed from the rare earth metal by distilling off the impurities by vacuum melting, after which the rare earths are themselves distilled off next from the less volatile impurities. When the vapor pressure of the rare earth is very high, e.g., Sc, Dy, Ho, Er, Lu, even distillation is not necessary. They can be purified by sublim ing them off from the impurity elements. This applies also to the most volatile of the rare earth metals, Sm, Eu, Tm, and Yb. 5.4.2 Removal of Halogens/Halides Fluorine and chlorine are the two elements usually found in as-reduced rare earths, and their removal by degassing is important (Croat 1969). They may be present in the rare earth either as unreduced trihalide salt or unre moved reductant salt. Both could either be dissolved in the metal or exist as a second phase adhering to the metal–slag interface or possibly even trapped in pockets beneath the surface of the ingot. For complete removal of these impurities to be possible, their vapor pres sures relative to that of the rare earth metal must be sufficiently different. Dysprosium, holmium, and erbium are the most volatile among all the rare earths prepared by a fluoride or chloride reduction process. The vapor pressures of pure Dy, Ho, and Er relative to the vapor pressure of their pure trifluoride salts and CaF2 are plotted in Figure 5.3 (Croat 1969). The vapor pressure curves of the metal and the fluoride salts are closely bunched almost at all temperatures, an d if the fluorine content removal occurs by fluoride salt evaporation, the chances of meta l purification with respect to fluorine impurity does not appear very good. It must, however, be borne in mind that th e relative vapor pressure of components in solution cannot be compared us ing vapor pressure data for pure components unless the activity coefficients of the system are kn own. Since the solutions considered in a purification situation are dilute (<0.1%), as a first approxi mation they may be assumed to follow Henry’s law and the partial pressure of the solute or impurity be considered to be proportional to its mole fraction. In contrast to the trifluoride salts, the tric hlorides exhibit considerable vapor pressure, as also shown in Figure 5.3 (Cro at 1969). The trichlorides are more volatile by a factor of 1000 than the trifluorides, and the separati on of chlorides from the metal should not pose serious problems. The situation is similar rega rding the volatility of calcium chloride and lithium chloride vis-à-vis the rare earth metals. pi0 pRE005 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 300 5.4.3 Degassing Among the nonmetallic impurities present in as-reduced rare earth metals, the most critical ones are the gaseous elements hydrogen, nitr ogen, and oxygen. Their removal from the rare earths can be termed degassing, and this is one of the most important and also most difficulttasks carried out during pyrovacuum treatment. The reaction between hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen with the rare earth metal can be represented by X 2 (g) ↔ [X]RE where X stands for H, N, or O and [ X]RE stands for the solution of the gas in the rare earth metal. If these gases have to be removed from so lid or liquid rare earths at a useful rate by pyrovacuum treatments, the equilibrium pressure of the gas species over the solution at the degassing temperature must be high. In othe r words, the following conditions should be satisfied: pX2 >> pRE and pX2 >> 1 mPa. The first condition is necessary for puri fication to occur by degassing. The second condition ensures that the degassing occurs at a practically useful rate. Hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen behave differently with respect to the above requirements. Dehydrogenation According to the rare earth metal–hydrogen phase diagrams (Lundin 1961), the composition range of the terminal solid solution be tween the rare earth metal and Figure 5.3 Vapor pressures of calcium fluoride, meta ls and of the trifluoride, trichloride of (a) dysprosium, (b) holmium and (c) erbium (Croat 1969). 1 2---05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 301 hydrogen is considerable, up to ~40 at % hydr ogen. In the range of hydrogen concentration usually encountered in as-reduced metals, the hy drogen will invariably be present in the solid solution. Hydrogen elimination will th erefore be determined by the pressure–com- positional isotherm of the solid solution. Thes e data point to near complete elimination of dissolved hydrogen from the rare earth metals during vacuum melting (Goldschmidt 1967).

In this concentr ation range, nitrogen is present in the rare earths as a solid solution. For example, the solu bility limit of nitrogen in cerium at 750°C is 0.3%. Data giving nitrogen pressure in e quilibrium with rare earth metal–nitrogen solid solution are sparse. The data on the free energy of formation of rare earth nitrides (Pankratz et al. 1984) indicate that the mononitrides of rare earths are stabler than the lowest nitrides (M2N) formed by group V metals vanadium, ni obium, and tantalum but are not quite as stable as those formed by the group IV meta ls titanium and zirconium. The decomposition pressures of these nitrides are low. The equi librium nitrogen pressure over the rare earth metal–nitrogen solid solutions would be co nsiderably lower. The rare earth would not easily degas with respect to nitrogen during vacuum melting (Golds chmidt 1967). Inci- dentally, the equilibrium nitrogen pressure ov er the RE–N solid would equal or exceed the vapor pressure of the metal itself for most of the rare earth metals. Deoxidation Among the nonmetallic impurities in rare earth metals, oxygen is the most important and invariably the nonmetallic elem ent present in greatest concentration in the as-reduced metal. Concentration of a few thou sand ppm of oxygen in as-reduced metal is not uncommon and the higher limit of the oxygen content may extend to 1% (Kremers 1961). The solution between the rare earth metal and oxygen has a large range (Massalski et al. 1990) and deoxidation ultimately involves removal of oxygen from the rare earth metal–oxygen solid solution. Ev en in metal–oxygen solutions of much lower stability than those of the rare earths (e.g., V–O, Nb–O, Ta–O system), equilibrium oxygen pressures over the solution are so low that deoxidatio n by degassing of oxygen is never considered as a possibility. A look at the oxygen partia l pressure data on the V–O, Nb–O, or Ta–O solid solution at any temperature indicates that deoxidation of these metals by evolution of gaseous oxygen is not possible because at al l temperatures the partial pressure of oxygen over the solution is considerably lower than th e partial pressure of the metal itself (Fromm and Horz 1980). The concentratio n of oxygen in these metals, however, decreases consider- ably during pyrovacuum treatments. This ha s been explained (Smith 1958, Brewer and Rosenblatt 1962, Garg and Sundaram 1974) as due to the formation and evaporation of certain complex oxide species. Sacrificial deoxidation The formation of volatile su boxides of several reactive and refractory metals and their evaporation fro m metal–oxygen systems was postulated and experimentally verified by mass spectrometri c investigations in th e 1950s and 1960s (Smith 1958, Ingram and Drowert 1960). Smith (1958), in his original paper on sacrificial deoxi- dation, listed yttrium as one of the metals th at will deoxidize by su boxide vaporization. It has been verified from experimental observation s that several rare earth elements do form suboxides. The formation and evaporation of volatile suboxides of a metal is by itself not a sufficient criterion for a metal to deoxidize. There are other factors, as described below. The formation of a rare earth metal suboxi de, (REO) may be represented as follows: [O]RE + RE = (REO) The square brackets represent the solution and the parentheses represent the gas phase. The standard free energy of formation of the gase ous suboxide becomes more negative with an increase in temperature in the same way as the stability of CO increases with an increase in temperature (Pankratz et al. 1984). When the volatile subo xide forms and evaporates, not only an oxygen atom is removed from the metal, but a metal atom is also lost (or sacrificed).05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 303 This process of deoxidation thus earned the na me sacrificial deoxidation. Initially Smith (1958) concluded that in all metal–oxygen systems where the ratio of the vapor pressure of the suboxides to that of the metal, pMO/pM, is more than 1, sacrificial deoxidation can lead to purification of the metal with respect to oxygen. In his original paper, he listed yttrium also as one of the metals amenable to sacrificial deoxidation because pyo/py was 103 at the vacuum treatment temperature. Se veral exceptions were subsequently found to this conclusion, and the ability to refine the metal by sacrificial deoxidation was found to depend on the R ratio value as defined (Brewer and Rosenblatt 1962) below: R = where CO and CM are the concentration (in at %) of o xygen and metal in the phases indi- cated by subscript. The R value essentially give s the relative concentration of oxygen in the vapor phase to that in the condensed phase. At a given temperature, the R value changes with a change in the oxygen content. Howeve r, Garg and Sundaram (1974) have pointed out that if the monoxide and monatomic metal are the only species in the vapor phase, and if the oxygen is in the concentration range where it obeys Henry’s law, the R factor approaches a limiting value independent of concentration at any temperature. The magni- tude of the limiting R value determines the possibility of sacrificial deoxidation. If this value is more than 1 then the metal can be purified by sacrificial deoxidation. The R values for rare earth metal–oxygen systems have not been computed. The requisite data, namely the vapor pressure of su boxide as a function of oxygen content, are not available. Certain conclusions, however, may be derived from experimental observ- ations on deoxidation during pyrovacuum treatme nt of oxygen containing rare earth metals. There are two other pyrovacuum deoxidation processes that might be useful for residual oxygen removal from the rare earth metals. Th ese are called carbon deoxidation and silicon deoxidation. Carbon deoxidation Carbon deoxidation is based on the occurrence of the following reaction [O]RE + [C]RE = (CO) between oxygen and carbon dissolve d in rare earth metals. Oxygen is present in the metal and a suitable quantity of carbon may be purp osely added to encourage carbon deoxidation. The occurrence of carbon deoxidation basical ly depends on the reaction given above leading to the establishment of a sufficient CO partial pressure over the RE–C–O system. The partial pressure of CO is related to the thermodynamic properties of the RE–C–Osystem by the following equation: p CO = γcXcγoXoexp(–∆GCO/RT) o where γc, γo and Xc, Xo are the activity coefficients and at om fractions of carbon and oxygen in the rare earth metals, respectively. If the valu es of these parameters are such that a suffi- cient CO pressure is established at the vacu um melting temperatures even at low oxygen contents, oxygen is removable by carbon deoxida tion. Here again to estimate the feasibility of carbon deoxidation the thermodynamic parameters γc and γo must be known.

The feasibility of carbon deoxidation in RE–C–O systems has to be assessed from ex perimental observations on deoxidation during pyrovacuum treatments of carbon-doped rare earth–oxygen alloys. Silicon deoxidation The deoxidation by silicon occurs in certain refractory metal–oxygen–silicon systems through the form ation and evaporation of silicon monoxide (Awasthi et al. 1998). The possible occurrence of sili con deoxidation in rare earth–oxygen alloys containing silicon may be represented by [O]RE + [Si]RE = (SiO) Calculation of silicon monoxide pressure and the estimation of silicon deoxidation tendency in the rare earth systems rely on th e activity coefficient values for oxygen and silicon being available. The development of good SiO pressure even at low Si and O contents in rare earths is key to the silicon deoxidation’s usefulness. In the deoxidation of group V metals, silicon deoxidation is provin g to be more efficient than carbon deoxi- dation. In the case of rare earth metals, the lack of thermodynamic data on the activity of silicon and oxygen in the metals precludes es timation of silicon deoxidation tendencies. Experimental observations on the pyrovacuum treatment of rare earth metal containing oxygen and doped with silicon forms the basis, presently, for assessing the silicon deoxi- dation tendencies of rare earth metals. The success of sacrificial, carbon, and silicon deoxidation processes for oxygen removal from the refractory metals like niobium is not only due to favorable values for the activity coefficients of oxyg en, carbon, silicon, and also th e free energy of formation of niobium monoxide, but also due to the metal’s high melting point and low vapor pressure. The last two properties enable the deoxidati on treatments to be conducted at high tem- peratures under conditions of enhanced suboxi de stability. Solid state processing enhances the more desirable carbon and silicon deoxidati on at the expense of the sacrificial mode of oxygen removal, which incidentally is more favored when the metal is molten (Garg and Sundaram 1975, Kruger 1971). Rare earth me tals, in comparison, are low melting and are also more volatile. These two factors limit th e extent to which car bon and silicon deoxida- tion processes can be useful for oxygen removal. The high volatility of many of the rare earth metals puts the spotlight on another method of refining for freeing the rare earth metal from oxygen. This option is to distill off the rare earth metal while leaving behind an oxygen-enriched residue. Unlike in the deoxi- dation procedures discussed above where a high volatility of the suboxide and other oxides is desired, when the metal is distilled off from an oxide-enriched residue, the volatility of oxygen containing vapors is unwelcome. Howeve r, the enrichment of oxygen in the melt actually encourages the evaporation of the oxygen containing vapors. Removal of Carbon and Silicon Carbon is very much less vo latile than even the least volatile of the rare earth metals. So when a rare earth metal containing only carbon as impurity is pyrovacuum treated, an increase in carbon concentration in the metal will result because of the preferential removal of the metal as vapor. The only method by which carbon can be removed in such a situation is by forming a volatile compound, and carbon monoxide is the compound formed in many refractory metal systems that contain residual carbon impurity to be removed. Carbon deoxi dation, when feasible, is not only useful for deoxidizing a metal but also for d ecarburizing it. By introducing oxygen in carbon-contaminated rare earth metal, the system becomes RE–C–O, and under pyrovacuum conditions the evolution of carbo n monoxide can ultimately bring down the05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 305 level of residual carbon. The ideal situati on exists when carbon and oxygen are removed only by CO evolution, i.e., exclusive carbon deoxidation, because in such a situation a precise quantity of oxygen doping will result in a predictable extent of carbon removal. As mentioned, however, the key factor is th e occurrence of carbon deoxidation in RE–C–O solid solution, which has yet to be established. Pure silicon is more volatile than carbon and also some of the rare earths. However, when present in low concentrat ions, silicon will not distill from the rare earth metals. In the sa me way that carbon removal can be attempted through the formation of CO, silicon remova l can occur through SiO vaporization. The feasibility of silicon removal by this reac tion depends on the feasibility of silicon deoxidation from RE–Si–O solid solution. The process of carbon and silicon removal fro m rare earth is not so easy as described above; therefore, the alternative of distilling off the rare earth metal and leaving behind a carbon- and/or silicon-enriched residue ma y be considered. The practicability of this approach depends on the rare earth metal vapo r pressure. As noted elsewhere, many of the rare earth metals are rather volatile, and in th ose cases distilling of the rare earth metal from the carbon and silicon impurities become s the practically useful approach. 5.5 PYROV ACUUM TECHNIQUES The metallothermic reduction of a rare earth metal is usually completed by pyrovacuum treatment that essentially comprises vacuum melting and/or vacuum distillation. The rare earth metals often contain many impurities that do not volatilize off during vacuum melting. Except perhaps oxygen, however, all these impurities will remain in the residue and possibly not interfere when the metal is distilled off and coll ected. Thus both the options of pyrovacuum treatment — vacuum me lting, which relies on the distilling off of the impurities either in elemental form or as certain compounds, and vacuum distillation, which relies on distilling off of the metal a nd leaving the impurities behind in the residue — are useful in pyrovacuum refining of the rare earth metals. As may be anticipated, vacuum melting and vacuum distillation are serially combined in the overall process sequence. The rare earth metals could be divided into four groups primarily on the basis of their volatility. In the post-reduction vacuum treatment, each group is processed somewhat differently. 5.5.1 Lanthanum, Cerium, Praseodymium, and Neodymium These four light rare earths are characterized by relatively low melting points, very high boiling points and hence extremely low vapor pressures at the melting point. High tem- perature vacuum melting is the only process by which they are pu rified. Distillation is ruled out on account of their low vapor pressure. As-reduced La, Ce, Pr, and Nd from the fluori de process just separated from the CaF2 slag contain Ca, CaF2 and F, and H. The rare earth metal containing these impurities readily reacts with moisture, and the as-reduced metal should always be handled under an inert atmosphere. All these impurities are more vol atile than the rare earth metals and are removed by melting the metals in a vacuum. Melting at pressures less than 0.1 Pa was05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 306 adequate for removing calcium. Calcium conten t thereby decreased from over 1% to less than 150 ppm. Although removal of Ca and H o ccurs by heating the metal to just above its melting point, the quantitative removal of fluorin e, which can be as high as 500 ppm in the as-reduced metal, required heating to at least 1800°C for 30 min. In the Ames practice (Beaudry and Gschneid ner 1978), vacuum melting of La and Ce was carried out at 1850°C; for Pr the temper ature was 1750°C, and for Nd it was 1650°C. The melting lasted at these temperature for 10 min. Heating was done in an induction furnace and a tantalum crucible was used. At the high temperatures used for vacuum melting, the rare earth metals dissolve a cons iderable amount of tantalum (Dennison et al. 1966, 1966a). However, the solubility of tant alum in these metals decreases with tempera- ture and it is very low at the melting point. This information was utilized in restricting the amount of tantalum impurity in the rare earth metal. After vacuum melting the metals at high temperature, the furnace was slowly cooled to about 10°C above the melting point of the me tal to allow the Ta to precipitate out of the solution and settle to the bottom of the crucib le. Empirically the time needed for complete settling of the tantalum was estimated at 24 min per cm height of the liquid metal column (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978). Later when the ingot was removed from the furnace, the thin tantalum crucible and the dendrites that had settled to the bottom of the crucible were machined off. Typical analysis of La, Ce, Pr, and Nd pr epared by calcium reduction of topped rare earth fluoride, followed by vacuum melting, is given in Table 5.1. During these processes the reactants and products were handled under inert gas cover.

As-reduced metal was purified by vacuum melting in a tantalum crucible, and the tantalum ingested into the metal was removed by precipitating it out in the molten metal and machining off the precipitate from the solidified rare earth metal ingot.

The volatile impurities calcium, mag- nesium, and the fluorides do not pose a seriou s problem with these metals because they are distilled off during the high temperature vacuum melting. The analysis of yttrium metal produced by direct calciothermic reduction of YF3 in the as-reduced form, just separated from CaF2 slag, is given in Table 5.2. The analysis of the metal produced by the Y–Mg intermediate al loy process after removal of Mg but before any refining treatment is also listed in the table. A variety of pyrovacuum treatments have been investigated for refining as-reduced yt trium. In addition to melting in tantalum crucibles in an induction furnace, other method s of vacuum melting have also been used. Yttrium metal sponge obtained after “demaggi ng” Y–Mg alloy has been purified by con- sumable electrode arc melting (Daane 1961). The demagged metal sponge has a calcium and magnesium content of 100 ppm each. To arc melt, these granular sponge particles were pressed into sticks that were welded end to end to make the electrode, and this electrode was consumable arc melted into a 100 mm diameter ingot in a vacuum. The 100 mm diameter ingots so obtained were welded together to make a 1525 mm long electrode, which was arc melted in a vacuum into 150 mm diameter ingots. A typical analysis of 150 mm diameter ingot thus obtained was: Ca less than 10 ppm, Mg 30 ppm, and O 500 to 1650 ppm. This ingot had a titanium content of 0.5 to 1.5%, derived mainly from the titanium crucible in which it was demagged. Titanium was not removed from yttrium by arc melting. Consumable electrode arc melting of yttrium, th e first melt in an argon atmosphere and the second in a vacuum at a nominal pressure of 0.1 Pa, typically yields a metal with the analysis listed in Table 5.2. There is a decreas e in the residual calcium content in the metal to about 5 ppm and that of ma gnesium to about 20 ppm (Huffi ne and Williams 1961). Arc melting caused little change as far as othe r impurities in yttrium are concerned.

Temescal Metallurgical Corporation developed the electron bomba rdment furnaces for conducting vacuum metallurgical processes, and the process wa s more often referred to as electron beam melting. This technique was considered a gr eat improvement over arc melting in a vacuum because in electron beam melting it was possible to maintain pressures of about 0.01 Pa or less in the immediate vicinity of the melting metal. Such pressures lead to volatilization processes proceeding more rapidly and to a gr eater degree of completion. As the melting metal would be made to drop off the feed stoc k, a large surface of the material was exposed and this also enhanced the purification reactions. The results of electron bombardment melting of yttrium (Huffine and Williams 1961) are given in Table 5.3. The purpose was to decrease the considerable oxygen content in yttrium by electron beam melting bu t the results were not encouraging. A more detailed investigation of electron beam melt refining of yttrium was carried out by Anable and Beall (1965) at the Albany Metallurgy Research Center of U.S. Bureau of Mines. Their purpose was to investigate th e purification of commercially available yttri- um by melting it in an electron bombardment furnace. Segments of yttrium weighing about50 grams were melted on a water-cooled copper hearth in the electron beam melting furnace. The samples were melted at power levels corr esponding to temperatures in the range 1730 to 1770°C at low pressure (7 ×10 –3 Pa to 13×10–3 Pa) for 1 to 120 minutes. The samples were cooled in a vacuum before they we re removed from the furnace and analyzed. The results of yttrium purification are listed in Table 5.4. On electron beam melting, except for nickel, silicon, and zirconium, the co ncentration of all other listed metallic im- purities lowered significantly. The aluminum content decreased from 50 to 30 ppm within a few minutes of exposure at all power leve ls except the lowest power level used. After exposure for 2 h, the Al content decreased to 10 ppm. The iron and copper were removed slowly throughout the two hours of exposure. The iron content came down from 100 to less than 50 ppm, and the copper content was lowered from 40 to 5 ppm. In the minimum exposure period of 20 min, the concentrat ions of magnesium and manganese decreased from 420 to <5 ppm and from 30 to <5 ppm, re spectively. No change occurred in the nickel and zirconium contents, which were origin ally at 100 and 3000 ppm, respectively.Table 5.3 Analyses of yttrium ingot before and afte r electron bombardment melting (Huffine and Williams 1961). *In the section of the electron bombardment melted ingot having the highest overall purity.Impurity Content, ppm Before melting After melting* O 3250 3470 N 200 310Zr 5000 4000 Cr 150 100 Fe 1000 190Ni 2000 2000 Cu – 10005 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 309Table 5.4 Purification of yttrium by electron beam melting (Anable and Beall 1965) The nickel and zirconium content remained constant at 100 and 3000 ppm, respectively.Temperature, °CDuration of melt, minWeight loss, %Analysis, ppm Al Cu C Fe H Mg Mn N O Si Start material 50 40 545 100 50 420 36 178 5860 100 1730 20 6.2 50 30 310 90 <0.5 <5 <5 220 8000 50 1730 120 24.4 50 5 440 <50 <0.5 <5 <5 240 10000 60 1745 20 10.0 30 30 230 90 <0.5 <5 <5 170 7500 80 1745 120 28.1 10 5 440 50 <0.5 <5 <5 210 12000 90 1760 20 11.1 30 30 240 90 <0.5 <5 <5 190 6000 50 1760 120 37.3 10 5 470 <50 <0.5 8 <5 250 11000 80 1770 20 10.3 30 30 220 90 <0.5 <5 <5 210 5500 50 1770 120 37.5 10 5 510 <50 <0.5 <5 <5 240 12000 6005 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 310 The silicon contents of all the samples decreas ed initially, in the first 20 minutes, from 100 ppm to about 50 ppm. The silicon content increased slightly to 60 ppm after 2 h of exposure. The changes in the oxygen, carbon and ni trogen content in yttrium during electron beam melting at various power levels (tempera tures) are shown in Figure 5.4. The oxygen content increased only by electron beam melting. The increase in oxygen content came about partly from the rapid loss of yttriu m and partly from oxygen pickup, probably resulting from degassing of the furnace an d from the small amount of oxygen that constantly leaked into the furnace. These data do not point to the occurrence of sacrificial deoxidation of yttrium. The carbon content of yttrium decreased initially from 545 pp m to 220 ppm during electron beam melting at 1770°C but on con tinued melting increased to a maximum of 510 ppm. This trend points to the possible occurrence of carbon deox idation in the initial stages oo Figure 5.4 Oxygen, carbon and nitrogen contents in electron beam melted yttrium (Anable and Beall 1965).05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 311 of melting. Specific experiments by Anable an d Beall (1965) where the duration of melting was up to 5 min (Table 5.5) and samples were analyzed every minute suggested the possibility of a carbon deoxidation in the ear ly phase of the operation: the carbon level came down from 545 to 330 ppm in the first minute and the oxygen content decreased from 5860 ppm to 4950 ppm during this period. A minimum level of oxygen was attained when yttrium was held molten for 1 min. Interestingl y, the oxygen content of yttrium during the first 5 min of melting was lower than any value observed between 20 and 120 min. In contrast, the lowest carbon values were consiste ntly obtained after 20 min rather than after 1 to 5 min. Anable and Beall (1965) conclu ded that a carbon reduction of oxygen was not involved because the oxygen loss is an order of magnitude greater than the carbon loss and the oxygen loss occurred considerably earlier in the operation. It must be noted, however, that the only way carbon can be removed at ~1750°C in vacuum from the yttrium considered here is by forming CO. Seco ndly, carbon deoxidation need not occur exclusively and thus can result in the removal of only a part of oxygen. The other part of oxygen removed may be accounted for by loss occurring due to suboxide, YO, vaporizing. The possibility of CO and YO vaporizing from the alloy cannot be ruled out. A mass spectrometric work, similar to the one carried out by Anable (1970) for vanadium, could possibly clarify the picture. The nitrogen content of yttrium remained nearly constant during electron beam melting. Some of the samples showed higher nitrogen content than the original metal. These observations are consistent with the ex pected behavior of no degassing of nitrogen from yttrium during pyrovacuum treatment. Th e increased nitrogen content may have the same explanation as increased oxygen conten t observed in the sample, on a minor scale. Having concluded that yttrium does not undergo sacrificial deoxidation during electron beam melting, Anable and Beall (1 965) attempted doping of oxygen-contaminated yttrium with a small amount of a second me tal or compound, so that a volatile compound that could be removed by evaporation migh t form. They investigated as many as 17 metallic additives and 3 compounds in addition to carbon. Among the metals investigated, titanium and zirconium are known to form vola tile suboxides that can be used for refining refractory metals (Garg and Sundaram 1975 ). Carbon and silicon are already the well-known deoxidizing agents in pyrov acuum treatments. Electron beam melting of doped yttrium was carried out at 1745°C and the metal was held molten for 5 min. The results of doping experiments did not show a ny decrease in oxygen content. Apparently, yttrium did not deoxidize by the sacrificial mode, nor did it undergo carbon or silicon deoxidation. Other pyrovacuum deoxidants li ke titanium and zirconium also failed withTable 5.5 Behavior of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen during electron beam melting of yttrium (Anable and Beall 1965) Temperature, °CDuration of melt, minWeight loss, %Analysis, ppm Carbon Nitrogen Oxygen Start material 545 178 5860 1745 1 7.5 330 190 4950 1745 2 4.0 330 290 52001745 3 5.5 350 180 5150 1745 4 6.2 380 270 5100 1745 5 6.5 430 300 5300 05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 312 yttrium. Electron beam melting of yttrium decr eased the residual fluorine content. The fall in fluorine content in yttrium from 0.06 to 0.002% was attributed to the evaporation of volatile oxyfluorides during electron beam melting (Carlson et al. 1960). Electron beam melting has also been used for the purifica tion of electrorefined gado- linium (Nagai et al. 1978, Zwilling and Gschneidner 1978). On electron beam melting, the fluorine content decreased from ab out 0.2% to less than 10 pp m. The hydrogen content also decreased to low levels. The removal of Ca, Mg, and fluorine has no t been a serious problem in these metals, and it is achieved by pyrovacuum treatment by induction melting or electron beam melting. The real challenge is posed by oxygen in th ese metals. In yttrium and gadolinium the oxygen content is not significantly decreas ed by induction or electron beam melting. In the same manner as in the first group of metals (La, Ce, Pr, and Nd) discussed, the use of tantalum crucible in a vacuum meltin g at ~1800°C leads to the dissolution of a certain amount of tantalum in the metals Y, Gd, Tb, and Lu. Unlike in the four light rare earths, however, the tantalum solubility in Y, Gd, Tb, and Lu does not decrease much on decreasing the temperature to the melting point, and therefore the tantalum in the solution does not precipitate out. The on ly pyrovacuum way to remove tantalum is by distilling off the rare earth metals, leaving tantalum in the residue. However, under certain circum- stances distillation can be avoided. If tungsten crucibles were used instead of tantalum in reduction and vacuum melting, tungsten would dissolve in the rare earth. But after vacuum Figure 5.5 Tantalum split resistance furnace used in 1.3 ×10–6 Pa vacuum system to sublime rare earth metals. The temperatures shown are typical for lutetium sublimation (Spedding et al. 1970).05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 313 melting in these metals, tungsten could be pr ecipitated out in exactly the same way as Ta was allowed to settle in La, Ce, Pr and Nd. Th is alternative is available if the 0.012 at % W that would persist in the Gd after precipitation can be tolerated. Similarly, at the end of precipitation, 0.03 at % W will remain in Tb and 0.07 at % W in yttrium (Dennison et al. 1966a, Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978). The distillation of Y, Gd, Tb, and Lu was ca rried out at Ames in tungsten crucibles because refluxing of some of the distilled metals eroded the tantalum crucibles causing them to leak. A tungsten lined condenser wa s used since tantalum diffuses into the hot condensate more readily than tungsten. Th e distillation unit at Ames (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978, Spedding et al . 1970) is shown in Figure 5.5. The distillation column was prepared from 0.76 mm tantalum and measured 125 mm by 40 mm in diameter. The condensers were prepared from 0.127 mm tant alum and were lined, leaving the lid, with 0.025 mm tungsten foil. The fu rnace used for distillation was a split tube tantalum resist- ance furnace 175 mm by 65 mm in diameter. The heater was made from 0.05 mm tantalum and was surrounded by 5 cylindrical radiatio n shields spaced approximately 6 mm apart. The sublimation column was suspended inside the heater by flaring the mouth of the column and dropping it through a tight-fi tting hole in the top radiation shielding. The reactor chamber housing the furnace syst em was a stainless steel ball jar, which was double walled for water cooling and had a quartz sight glass for optical temperature measurement. The vacuum system for this ch amber consisted of a 400 lps ion pump and a 4000 lps titanium sublimator pump, and these pumps evacuated the system to 1.3 ×10–6 to 1.3×10–7 Pa after it was initially evacuated to <0.6 Pa with a 425 lpm fore pump. The details of pyrovacuum treatment such as temperatures of vacuum melting and distillation, the impurities that usually rema ined, the temperature of the condenser, the typical size of the run and distillation rate are all summarized (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978) in Table 5.6. The distillat ion rate was quite slow (~1 g/h), and in a week only 168 g of metal was purified. However, a slow rate of distillation helped minimize the impurity transfer from the crucible to the distillate. In commercial practices a much higherdistillation rate was used. The vacuum required in the distillation assembly was better than 1.3×10 –6 Pa so that contamination of the distillate was prevented. The oxygen contents of Y, Gd, and Tb we re not decreased even by distillation. This has been reasoned by Spedding et al. (1968) as due to the co-distillation of the volatile oxides YO, GdO and TbO. The vapor pressure of these volatile oxides is high enough in the rare earth matrix that they distill along with the metals. According to Spedding et al. (1968), for each metal at a given temperature of distillation a constant boiling mixture is apparently reached where the two species, meta l and suboxide, came over in the same ratio and repeated distillations led to very little improvement. This points to the possibility that the R value of the sacrificial deoxidation is 1 fo r these metals. In this situation volatile metal suboxides vaporize but there will be no decrease in the oxygen content. Among all the rare earth metals, yttrium is especially troublesome with oxygen impurity (Spedding et al. 1968). It is the most difficult element from the standpoint that under similar conditions of preparation the oxygen content of the final metal is likely to run the highest of all the rare earths or even ra re earth-like elements. The only way out seems to be in preparing the original metal with as little oxygen as possible by starting with very pure raw materials and by taki ng great pains to carry out all operations in highly purified inert atmosphere.05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 314 5.5.3 Scandium, Dysprosium, Ho lmium, Erbium, and Lutetium These metals have appreciable vapor pressure at their melting points. The vacuum melting, therefore, had to be relatively brief or much of the metal would be lost by distillation. The temperature and duration of vacuum melting normally practiced (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978) are listed in Table 5.7. Fluorine impurity, which was removed relatively easily in the two groups of rare earth metals described earlier, was particularly diffi cult to remove from this group of metals. Table 5.6 Preparation method and major impurities in yttrium, gadolinium, terbium, and lutetium (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978) Method: Ames Process Calciothermic reduction of rare earth trifluoride in a tantalum crucible. As-reduced metal was purified by vacuum melting in a tantalum crucible and the tantalum ingested into the metal was removed by a vacuum distillation step. For vacuum distillation of yttrium, gadolinium, and terbium, tungsten crucibles and tungsten-lined tantalum cond ensers were used, whereas for lutetium, which could be purified by vacuum sublimation, tantalum crucible and tungsten-lined condenser were used. Pure metal was collected as the condensate. Tantalum impurity remained in the residue. The entire process was carried out in a protected atmo sphere of purified inert gas or under high vacuum as appropriate.

This amounted to 30% for Sc and Dy, 20% for Ho, and 10% for Er. This evaporated metal and the volatilized impurities were, however, collected in a Ta cylinder placed above the crucible to facilitat e easy recovery of the metal. The duration of vacuum melting could be shortened and hence me tal loss decreased if several hundred ppm impurities can be tolerated in the final product. The removal of fluorine from Dy, Ho, and Er was also investigated by Croat (1969). A single batch of 1070 gms of as-reduced Dy was vacuum melted at approximately 1450°C for 5 min. In the process, 3 45 gms (approximately 30%) of the metal distilled out of the crucible but was collected. This distillate co ntained 6500 ppm fluorine and 3000 ppm Ca.Table 5.7 Preparation method and major impurities in scandium, dysprosium, holmium, and erbium (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978) Method: Ames Process Calciothermic reduction of rare earth trifluoride in a tantalum crucible.

Similar results were obtained for Er. Duri ng vacuum melting, 20% of the metal was removed. The distillate contained 1300 ppm fluorine and the melt had only 32 ppm. The other part of pyrovacuum treatment in the refining of Sc, Dy, Ho, and Er is sublimation. The high volatility of these meta ls is an advantage here and purification of metals by sublimation is comparatively easy. Ta ntalum introduced in the metals during the vacuum melting step was removed by sublim ing off the metal. The common interstitial impurities N, C, and O formed stable compou nds and remained in the residue when these metals were sublimed at a slow rate. Because this operation was so effective, the great care taken to remove oxygen from fluoride and to prevent the introduction of it and other interstitial impurities in the first two groups of metals was not necessary here. Sc, Dy, Ho, and Er metals were purified with respect to these three interstitial impurities during the sublimation step. The major problem on purificat ion of these metals by sublimation is the carryover of fluorine impurity into the cond ensate. If any fluorides are present, either dissolved in the metal or in the slag trapped in the metal or even attached to the surface, the fluorides distill along with th e metal and these metals analyze high in fluoride contami- nation (Spedding et al. 1968). The solution to this problem is either preparing the metals fairly free from fluoride impurities or in fo llowing a reduction process such as the vapor phase rare earth chloride redu ction technique (Croat 1969). Croat (1969) has compared the purity of Dy, Ho, and Er obtained by the chloride process as well as by the fluoride process. He stated that in terms of metal purity, the as-reduced Dy, Ho, and Er from th e chloride process are better because the low temperature (900°C) of reduction results in quite low (<30 ppm) tantalum pick up. This may be compared with 0.1–0.2% Ta in the as-fluoride -reduced metal. Also, the chloride process eliminates F as an impurity without at the same time introducing characteristic impurities such as Cl and Li. Comparing Dy, Ho, and Er prepared from both chloride and fluoride methods and sublimed under the same conditio ns, Croat (1969) concluded that the metals were identical in purity with the exception of 25–75 ppm F in the metal prepared from the fluoride. The analysis data given by Beau dry and Gschneidner (1978) show that the fluorine content even in the fluoride-reduced and sublimed metal is only about 10 ppm or less, see Table 5.7. The sublimation temperatur es given in the table are about 100°C lower than the temperatures used by Croat (1969), an d the sublimation rates in the table are also only one-fifth of the rate used by Croat (1969). Lutetium had been purified by distillation as well as by sublimation (Spedding et al. 1968). When distillation was carried out at 1850°C in tantalum crucibles, tantalum dissolved in the refluxing liquid lutetium an d the liquid metal often eroded a hole through the tantalum crucible. At such high temperat ures oxygen also apparently distilled along with lutetium. Sublimation of lutetium at a temperature slightly below its melting point seemed the better alternative. However, the use of tungsten crucible and tungsten-lined condenser enabled distillation of lutetium wi thout extensive crucible attack (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978). 5.5.4 Samarium, Europium, Thulium, and Ytterbium These four metals are prepared by the lant hanothermic or reduction–distillation method. Tantalum is not the major impurity with th e metals Sm, Eu, Tm, and Yb because they do not undergo the high temperature vacuum melting step. The reduced–distilled metals05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 317 usually contain several hundred ppm La in addition to O and H. These impurities are removed by sublimation. The details of this sublimation and the levels to which the impurities are removed are given in Tabl e 5.8 (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978). The sublimation is carried out in the same crucible in which the reduction–distillation is done. A tantalum optical baffle arrang ement is provided in the condenser during reduction–distillation to prevent excessive entr ainment of oxide particles. The baffles are removed, and the crucible is leached with acid and then vacuum degassed at 1800°C to remove any volatile impurities before carrying out the low temperature sublimation. The metals in the as-sublimed condition ar e composed of many small crystals and possess a large surface area. They are then pron e to react with air and pick up impurities. The metal crystals are therefore consolidated as soon as possible. One method is to seal them in a tantalum crucible in an inert gas we lder and then heat the crucible in vacuum toTable 5.8 Preparation method and major impurities in samarium, europium, thulium, and ytterbium (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978) Method: Ames Process: Direct reduction or reduction–distillation Lanthanothermic reduction of rare earth oxide in a tantalum crucible-tantalum condenser assembly. As-reduced metal distills off simultaneously and collects in the condenser. The condensate was purified with respect to major impurities: lant hanum, oxygen, and hydrogen by vacuum sublimation in a tantalum crucible. The entire process was carried out in a protected atmosphere of purified inert gas or under high vacuum as appropriate.

The high reactivity of eu ropium necessitates that the as-sublimed metal be handled under an iner t atmosphere. Hydrogen remains as an impurity in the as-sublimed metal. This can be remove d quantitatively in the consolidation step by holding the temperature above the metals’ me lting point for 24 h in a dynamic vacuum. Hydrogen diffuses through the Ta and is pumped away. While the pyrovacuum treatments of vacu um melting and vacuum distillation/ sublimation have been the most important me thods of as-reduced metal refining, several other methods have been explored for this purifi cation. Electrorefining in a fused salt is one among these methods. This method has been applied particularly to yttrium and gadolinium. Figure 5.6 Schematic of the electrorefining apparatus (Merrill and Wong 1967).05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 319 5.6 ELECTROREFINING Electrorefining as a process for rare earth metal purification has been applied for the purification of yttrium and gado linium. These are the two metals that are most difficult to obtain in pure form by the exclusive pyrome tallurgy route unless great pains are taken to choose very pure materials and carry out a ll operations in a highly purified inert atmosphere. With gadolinium there is the additional problem of removing dissolved tantalum. Gadolinium has both a low melting point and a low vapor pressure. There is a good amount of refluxing during the distillati on process and this causes considerable attack on the W or Ta crucible used (Beaudry and Gschneidner 1978). 5.6.1 Yttrium Electrorefining of yttrium was investigated by Merrill and Wong (1967) at the Reno Metallurgy Center of U.S. Bureau of Mines. Th e starting material was an ingot of yttrium containing about 0.57% oxygen, 2.25% zirc onium, 0.08% tantalum and several hundred ppm each of carbon, nitrogen, and many other metallic impurities. They used a LiCl–YCl3 electrolyte at 710°C. Adhering electrolyte salt was removed from the electrodeposited metal by vacuum distillation. In their study the affinity of yttrium for oxygen was given major consideration, and emphasis was placed on selecting equipment and procedure that would minimize the contact of the product with air and moisture. The apparatus shown schematically in Fi gure 5.6 was used by Merrill and Wong (1967). This system permitted electrorefining and vacuum distillation of the product to be performed under an inert gas, thus minimizing atmosphere contamination. In the cell, a 12 mm diameter mild steel rod was used as the cathode, and the anode was the electrolyte chamber with cr ude yttrium charged in the bottom. The distillation retort, 75 mm in diameter and 430 mm long, was made of mild steel, and had a nickel liner. The charge was contained in a tantalum basket. At the start of the electrolysis approximat ely 1200 g of freshly cut pieces of yttrium metal (50 ×50×25 mm) were loaded in the chamber an d degassed. Then 1600 g of LiCl were also charged. After evacuating and backfilli ng with helium, the cell was heated to 710°C. The YCl3 component in the electrolyte was made in situ by reacting HCl gas with yttrium metal, using an in situ chlorination apparatus. After the desired concentration of YCl3 in the electrolyte was attained, chlorination wa s stopped, the cathode was installed, and electrolysis was commenced. Details of the elect rolysis and analysis of the product obtained are listed in Table 5.9. At the end of each deposition cycle, the cathode deposit was lifted above the electro- lyte, allowed to drain, sealed in the receiver, and cooled to room te mperature. The deposit was then stripped from the cathode, loaded into a tantalum basket and sealed in the distil- lation retort. Distillation of the salt from th e cathode deposit was carried out at 880°C for 3 h with a final pressure of less than 1.3 Pa. The salt condensed in a ring inside the liner at a level slightly below the external cooling jacket. There was a facility to compact the product metal by a press inside the inert gas ch amber before it was sealed in a bottle prior to removal from the chamber. The results given in Table 5.9 indicate that the electrolysis was effective in lowering all metallic impurities but not the interstitial elements. The nitrogen content in the refined ooo 05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 320 metal was higher than that of the anode f eed even though the oxygen content was appre- ciably lower. Above 5.4 mol % YCl3 in the electrolyte, the oxyg en content in the electro- refined metal increased sharply (to values mu ch more than that in the anode feed) with increase in the proportion of YCl3 in the electrolyte. For example, when the YCl3 content was 13.4 mol %, the oxygen content of th e electrorefined metal was approximatelyTable 5.9 Fused salt electrorefining of yttrium (Merrill and Wong 1967) Electrolysis parameters Electrolyte composition, % (i) 1.7 YCl3 – 98.3 LiCl (ii) 5.4 YCl3 – 94.6 LiCl Temperature, °C 710 Cathode 12.5 mm diameter mild steel rod Anode Crude yttrium Container Mild steelCell Mild steel Voltage, V (i) 0.35 (ii) 0.67 Current, A (i) 5 (ii) 20 Initial cathode current density, A·cm –2(i) 0.44 (ii) 1.76 Cathode current efficiency, % (i) 99 (ii) 98 Weight of metal deposited, g (i) 32,9 (ii) 32,6 Analysis, ppm nr: not reported bl: below detection levelImpurity Anode feed Electrorefined metal (i) Electrorefined metal (ii) Al 60 25 bl C 135 40 10 Ca 250 <10 10 Cl nr 1800 2100 Cu 55 15 <10 Fe 360 25 35 Li <10 25 100 N 140 240 200 Ni 210 <10 bl O 5750 2400 3400 Si 110 <45 130 Ta 800 <300 <300 Ti 460 <250 <250 Zr 22500 <250 <250 05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 321 13,000 ppm, whereas it was only about 5700 pp m in the anode feed. However, an increase in the YCl3 concentration in electrolyte did not markedly affect the metallic impurity levels. Cathode current efficiency was excelle nt, always above 90% and in some tests it was 100%. No noticeable effect of the impurity content of the electrorefined metal was observed with variation in initial cathode current density. The efforts on electrorefining of yttrium we re continued at Reno with Fleck et al. (1973) using selected low melting yttrium base alloys as anodes in addition to crude yttrium. Electrolysis in other than LiCl–YCl3 electrolytes was also tried to possibly achieve the difficult refining with respect to oxygen. The electrorefining apparatus used by Fleck et al. (1973) is shown in Figure 5.7. All the experiments were conducted in a helium at mosphere. The electrolyte consisted of LiCl and YCl3. A variety of yttrium-containing materials were used as anode. They are listed in Table 5.10. The results demonstrated that the process re sults in a substantial decrease in the levels of metallic impurities in the cathode deposit when anodes of yttrium alloys with iron, Figure 5.7 Electrorefining apparatus (Fleck et al. 1973).05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 322 Table 5.10 Fused salt electrorefining of yttrium — metallic elements transfer (Fleck et al. 1973) Electrolysis parameters Electrolyte composition, wt %: LiCl–7 to 12 YCl3 Container: Tungsten crucible (75 mm in diameter and 150 mm in height) Temperature, °C: 900–1000, 825 for 60 Y–40 Mg alloy Cell: USBM inert atmosphere electrorefining apparatus Cathode: 6 mm diameter tungsten rod Voltage, V: 0.35 Anode: Crude yttrium Initial cathode current density, A·cm–2: 0.27 Result summary: Analysis values in ppm Element 80Y–20Ni 80Y–20Fe 80Y–20Cu 60Y–40Mg Anode Initial run Final run Anode Initial run F inal run Anode Initial run Final run Anode Initial run Final run Al 70 22 <20 40 <20 <20 40 <15 15 60 <15 <15 Ca <20 nd nd <20 nd nd <20 nd nd <20 nd nd Cr 150 <3 3 <3 <3 <3 Co <30 nd nd <30 nd nd 30 50 nd Cu 240 27 25 180 18 21 20% 7 2100 120 <20 <20 Fe 220 <15 <15 20% <15 18 110 <20 <20 180 1800 1800 Mg 14 14 <10 <10 <10 <10 10 25 160 40% 1000 11% Mn 740 <6 21 120 <6 <6 120 <10 15 200 160 400 Mo 30 <7 <7 30 <7 <7 35 nd nd 20 10 10 Ni 20% <10 20 1200 <10 <10 1200 nd 500 900 nd nd S i 1 2 0< 4 5< 4 5 5 0< 4 5< 4 5 5 0< 1 0< 1 0 5 0< 2 0 < 2 0 CCE, %9 8 6 99 9 7 08 8 6 56 8 1 3 Y yield, % 957 08 0n r nd, not detected; nr, not reported05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 323 nickel, and manganese were used. Yttriu m–copper and yttrium–magnesium, however, were not satisfactorily electrorefined because the copper and magnesium transferred to the cathode products in appreciable quantities. No refining with respect to oxygen occurred in electrolysis conducted using LiCl–YCl3. Fleck et al. (1973) also evaluated electrolytes composed of bromides and fluorides and the re sults are summarized in Table 5.11. In these systems, the refining of the metallic impuri ties was the same as that achieved in the LiCl–YCl3 melt. There is very little, if any, refining with respect to oxygen in the NaBr–KBr–YBr3 melt. The oxygen content was sign ificantly reduced when yttrium was electrorefined in a LiF–YF3 or LiCl–LiF–YF3 system. The main problem, however, in most of these electrolytes was that it was im possible to completely remove the adhering salts from the metal crystals in the cathode deposit. 5.6.2 Gadolinium The purification of crude gadolinium by fused salt electrorefining was investigated by Nagai, Beaudry, and Gschneidner (1978) and also by Bratland and Gschneidner (1980). Nagai et al. (1978) used a fluoride–chloride elect rolyte composed of 77.6% LiCl, 11.2% LiF, and 11.2% GdF3. The function of LiF was prim arily to increase conductivity and also to lower the melting temperature of GdF3 (GdF3– 27% LiF melts at ~ 625°C). LiCl lowers the melting temperature of the mixtur e even further. The cathode was pure gado- linium, prepared from distilled gadolinium, in the form of a rod 1.6 mm diameter × 15 cm long. The anode, which was the impure gadolinium to be refined, was prepared from gadolinium made by the calcium reduction of untopped GdF3 followed by vacuum melting. The anode was in the form of a cylind er 13 mm diameter and 150 mm long. A tantalum crucible, 65 mm diameter an d 130 mm long was used to contain the electrolyte. A schematic diagram of the appara tus used for electrolysis is given in Figure 5.8. The 88 mm diameter and 600 mm long st ainless steel tube in which electrolysis was carried out was lined with tantalum to preven t attack by the LiCl and LiF vapors from the electrolyte. After electrolysis, the cleaned cathode deposit was heated in a vacuum induction furnace to 800°C an d held for 30 min at 1.3 ×10–4 Pa to remove the adhering electrolyte. The crystals were then arc melted to consolidate them. The details of electrolysis parameters and purity achieved by Nagai et al. (1978) are summarized in Table 5.12. The purest deposit of Gd was obtained when LiCl and LiF were purified by distillation. The H and F impuriti es were rather high in the as-arc-melted Gd. Electron beam melting removed both fluorin e and hydrogen.

Gadolinium was electrorefined in an al l fluoride electrolyte by Bratland and Gschneidner (1980). The electrolysis cell was esse ntially the same as that used by Nagai et al. (1978), shown in Figure 5.8. The only di fference was that a swing gate valve was mounted in the stainless steel container where the electrolysis cell was located. The advantage, like in the Reno cells, is that wi th the furnace still hot, the electrode could be removed from the system without admitting air to the hot part of the container, which was kept under argon atmosphere at all times. A viewing glass was provided in the top lid to observe the cell. The electrolyte consisted of 65 mol % LiF and 35 mol % GdF3. Commercially available gadolinium metal was used as the star ting material for electrowinning. A graphite crucible, 90 mm inside diameter and 100 mm deep, was used to contain the 1.6 kg electrolyte. The gadolinium to be electrorefined was made in the form of a rod and used as the anode. The cathode was a 6 mm diameter tant alum rod. The electrolysis temperature was 900°C. These and other details of elect rolysis are summarized in Table 5.13. The electrolyte was not subjected to an y special purification procedure before charging. It was, however, subjected to pr e-electrolysis. The pre-electrolysis was carried out at a constant voltage of 2.7 V and a temper ature of 900°C. This step was for removal of dissolved oxide and hydroxide. Bratland and Gschneidner (1980) found that in 2½ h of electrolysis, a 90% decrease in the oxide concentration was achieved and continued pre-electrolysis of the melt for 6 h decreased the terminal oxide concentration further. At this stage, the electrolyte was considered re ady for electrorefining the gadolinium metal. Figure 5.8 Schematic of the electrolysis system (Nagai et al. 1978). 05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 325 In the electrorefining experiments, two cathode arrangements were tried by Bratland and Gschneidner (1980). In one, the cathode was inserted 6 mm into the electrolyte for the entire run. In the second, the cathode barely touched the surface in the beginning of the experiment, and as the metal formed on the cathode it was gradually pulled upward in increments of 5 mm for a total of 35 mm. This was primarily tried to improve the saltdrainage of the cathode deposit, which is a pr oblem in all molten salt electrorefining where crystalline deposits are obtained. The electrorefined gadolinium was consol idated by arc melting. The current efficiency, calculated on the basis of the amo unt of metal recovered after arc melting two times, was 69.2 and 84.0%, respectively, fo r the stationary catho de and the retracting cathode. Higher current efficiency in the latt er case can be reasoned as due to the more efficient removal of the gadolinium deposit when only the tip of the cathode or metal was exposed to the bath. Besides, when the meta l was exposed to the bath for a shorter time, redissolution of the metal was minimized. Ho wever, there was no improvement as far as salt drainage was concerned when the cath ode was gradually pulled out of the bath. In addition to higher current efficiency , the product obtained with the retractable cathode was purer, as shown in Table 5.13, indicating that the contaminations originate from the bath and/or the anode metal and not from the furnace atmosphere. The oxygen content of the metal electrorefi ned with retracted cathode was lower than any previously electrowon or electrorefined gadol inium metal. This implies that preelectro- lysis of the electrolyte was at least as eff ective as other methods of purification such as treating molten gadolinium fluoride under a dynamic HF – 60% Ar atmosphere. Between the two alternatives, pre-electrolysis appear s more attractive because it can be performed in situ .

Electrolysis of an oxide-defi- cient melt, which probably still contained so me oxide, yielded a minimum concentration of about 80 ppm oxygen. Zwilling and Gschneidner (1978) used purified lithium fluoride and gadolinium fluoride containing less than 20 ppm oxygen, and adding no oxide, electrolyzed the melt to obtain gadolinium dendrites that still contained a minimum of 40 ppm oxygen. Comparing these results with those obtained by Bratland and Gschneidner (1980) using pre-electrolysis indicated that pre-electroly sis was attractive not only because it was convenient, but also because it was very effect ive in decreasing the oxygen content of the bath and hence in the electrorefined metal. The carbon content of electrorefined gado linium was more than that of the impure anode. The source was a graphite cell. A sma ll immersed graphite anode might reduce the contamination and eliminate the need for a gr aphite cell. Zwilling a nd Gschneidner (1978), however, found that the carbon contamination of gadolinium electrorefined in a Ta crucible was lower (60 to 100 ppm) but still consid ered more. This resulted from carbon impurity in the lithium fluoride. It was apparently no t true after all that the carbon anode was the principal source of carbon contaminat ion in electrorefined gadolinium. The nitrogen content of the gadolinium el ectrolyzed by the above procedure was more than what was normally found in gadolinium el ectrowon in a similar cell. It appeared that nitrogen was very effectively transferred th rough the electrolyte from anode to cathode. oooTable 5.13 Purification of gadolinium by electrorefini ng with pre-electrolysis (Bratland and Gschneidner 1980) Electrolysis parameters Electrolyte composition, mole % 65LiF–35GdF3 Temperature, °C 900 Cathode Pure gadolinium rod Anode Crude gadolinium Container Graphite cruciblePre-electrolysis Voltage, V 2.7Duration, h 8 Electrolysis Current, A 4Duration, Ah 5 Cathode current densityCurrent efficiency, % 84 Analysis (ppm) Element Impure anode Stationary cathode Retractable cathode O 1100 50 34H 88 50 21N 400 140 43 C 209 not detected 253 05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 327 Hydrogen and oxygen were also transferred to the electrolyte by anodic dissolution. The ap r i o r i concentration of these elements as oxide and hydroxide impurities in the electrolyte, however, determined the hydrogen and oxyge n contamination of the electrorefined metal. In their experiments, Bratland and Gschneid ner (1980) found that pre-electrolysis was at least as efficient as any other purificatio n method known. While most of the oxygen and hydrogen were removed, the last traces of ox ygen and hydrogen were virtually impossible to remove. Besides yttrium and gadolinium, electro refining was tried for cerium also. The experiments, mainly to see feasibility, were conducted at Reno by Shedd, Marchant and Henrie (1964). 5.6.3 Cerium The electrorefining of relatively impure ceriu m metal in a chloride electrolyte was demon- strated by Shedd, Marchant, and Henrie (196 4) at Reno. The electrolysis parameters and results are summarized in Table 5.14. An electrolyte composed of 64% BaCl2, 17% KCl, and 19% LiCl was melted in a graphite lined 100 mm diameter inert atmosphere electrorefining cell. Cerium chloride was generated in situ in the electrolyte by chlorinating a cerium bar with HCl gas. When the electrolyte contained 1% CeCl3, the chlorination was stopped and the cerium bar was removed. A 5 mm diameter tantalum cathode and a 12 mm diameter cerium anode were inserted 75 mm in the bath. Electrorefining was conducted at 0.17 V and 2.5 A, and the operating temper ature was 700°C (about 100 degrees lower than the melting point of cerium). Very fine crysta ls of cerium were deposited on the cathode. This deposit and adhered salt were melted at 900°C under an inert atmosphere in a boronTable 5.14 Fused salt electrorefining of cerium (Shedd et al. 1964) Electrolysis parameters Electrolyte composition, wt % 1 CeCl3–63 BaCl2–17 KCl–19 LiCl Temperature, °C 700 Cathode 5 mm diameter tantalum rod Anode 12 mm diameter cerium rod Cell graphiteCurrent, mA 2.5 Voltage, V 0.17 Analysis (ppm) Impurity Before refining After refining C 350 190 O4 0 3 0Si 30 50 Fe 340 40 Mo 600 80Al 250 20 Total impurities 1610 41005 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 328 nitride crucible. After melting, the contents were poured on a tungsten crucible and the cerium button and salt were readily separated. The analysis of the starting material and refined metal is given in Table 5.14. Shedd et al. (1964) noted that the anode was made by consolidating the small, impure, pea-size cerium nodules obtained during electrowinning. After refining this material, a purer product than the electrowon metal was obtained. 5.7 ULTRAPURIFICATION METHODS After the pyrovacuum or electrorefining treatme nts for removing a variety of metallic and nonmetallic impurities from as-reduced rare earth metals, certain purification techniques may be applied to the purified metals for seve ral reasons: (i) to further decrease the contents of impurities that have already been removed by the purification techniques, (ii) to remove impurities whose concentration had not decreased by the purification techniques, and (iii) to remove impurities that have inevitably b een introduced by the purification techniques. These methods are known as ultrapurification methods. Two techniques of ultrapurification have been widely applied for the rare earth me tals. They are zone refining and solid state electrotransport. 5.8 ZONE REFINING The process of zone refining involves generati ng a thin molten zone of the metal by loca- lized melting and passing the zone slowly along the length of the metal rod to be purified in one direction several times. Purification ta kes place at the traveling solid–liquid inter- face. The solubility of an impurity element in the coexisting solid and liquid phases is usually different. Impurities more soluble in th e molten metal will move in the direction in which the molten zone is moved and therefore c oncentrate in the zone to solidify last and accumulate in the finishing end of the rod. On the other hand, impurities more soluble in the solid phase concentrate in the crystallizin g solid and so ultimately accumulate in the starting end of the rod. The liquid soluble and solid soluble impurities apparently move in opposite directions. Zone refining is essent ially a technique for impurity redistribution within the sample rather than impurity remova l (Pfann 1966), and only a portion of the rod ends up as pure metal in the process. Since th e extent of purification depends on the solu- bility of the impurities in the solid metal, those impurities that are soluble in the solid cannot be removed to below the equilibrium co ncentration. As a result, the interstitial impurities that are quite soluble in the solid rare earth metal just below its melting point cannot be removed completely. Generally, zone refining is more useful for substitutional impurity removal and less effective for the in terstitial impurities. The use of a vacuum in the process combines the benefits of conventi onal zone refining wi th those of pyrovacuum treatments. In the zone refining of rare earth metals, the use of high vacuum or an equally pure inert atmosphere is mandatory to prev ent the metal from picking up impurities from the gaseous atmosphere. Basically two techniques are used for pass age of molten zones. The simpler technique involves the use of a crucible to hold the meta l. The metal is contained in a long horizontal05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 329 trough or crucible and the zone is moved in a horizontal direction. As mentioned earlier, the rare earth metals are so reactive that they reduce ceramic container materials at theirmelting points and get contaminated. Attempts have been made to overcome this problem by using a water-cooled container in which an unmolten skin of the metal being purified is maintained, and this thin skin acts as the tr ue container of the molten metal. The other technique is the vertical floating zone techni que in which the metal is supported vertically from the ends without a container, the narrow molten zone being maintained because of the surface tension of the metal. Heating in either method is by induction and this mode of heating can have either an inert atmosphere or vacuum. Better control and narrower zones are obtained by electron beam heat ing but this requires a high vacuum. 5.8.1 Preliminary Studies At the time of the first review on zone refi ning of rare earths by Huffine and Williams (1961), zone refining had been reported on only two metals. Kendall in General Electric had purified gadolinium by us ing the conventional horizontal induction heating technique with a tantalum crucible in a purified argo n atmosphere (Huffine and Williams 1961). He made 10 passes of a 45 mm wide zone at a rate of 38 mm/h. The product was evaluated only by metallography. The purified ingot showed s ubstantial concentration of impurities at the ingot ends with corresponding purifi cation of the middle of the ingot. Yttrium was subjected to purification by zone melting at the General Electric Company’s Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Depa rtment (GE–ANPD), and the results were summarized by Huffine and Williams (1961). The refining was done by the floating zone technique with induction heatin g, and a 9.5 mm diameter ro d was processed in a continu- ously pumped vacuum. Three heating passes were made (below the melting point) in order to remove the volatile impurities sufficiently to prevent the arcing of the heating coil. The main impurity, magnesium, and a considerable amount of yttrium oxyfluoride were vapo- rized. Following this, six zone passes were ma de at the rate of 64 mm/h, and the analysis of the purified metal is given in Table 5.15.

Other indicators of purity such as microstructure an d hardness also did not reveal any significant variation with location in the zone-refined rod. It appeared that zone refining was not a useful purification process for yttrium. Two other early attempts at zone refining of yttrium were reported. An yttrium rod containing 0.052% oxygen and 0.065% fluorine was zone refined in two passes by Carlson et al. (1960). However, no significant chan ge in oxygen content was observed although there was a decrease in the fluorine content. Th e decrease in fluorine was attributed to the evaporation of oxyfluoride. Necker (1961) zone refined yttrium and observed that metallic impurities could be decreased from 4300 to 1800 ppm after six zo ne passes. This observation did not agree with that of Huffine and Williams (1961). Revel et al. (1974) carried out the zone refining of cerium in an induction-heated cold crucible. They found that 12 passes of a molt en zone decreased a number of metallic impu- rities to the part per billion range. The purifi cation with respect to interstitial impurities during the zone refining was not determined. Beaudry and Gschneidner (1978) noted that it was not likely that purification with respect to interstitial was attained during the experi- ments of Revel et al. (1974) because the vacuum used wa s inadequate and the interstitial impurities exhibit high solubility in solid cer ium. They, however, stated that from impure cerium, many metallic impurities coul d be decreased by zone refining. Two years later, Hukin and Jones (1976) zo ne refined terbium under an atmosphere of pure argon in a horizontal cold crucible with induction heating. They observed that O, N, and C moved in the direction opposite to that of the molten zone. Significant purification with respect to the interstitial as well as the metallic impurities was reported. Jones et al. (1978) reported that in much of the earlier work on zone melting, the ingot underwent degradation during processing partic ularly by oxygen and nitrogen rather than undergoing any possible improvement from the treatment. In fact, they were corroborating the statement of Revel et al. (1974) that zone refining of cerium would fail to remove non- metallic elements (N, O) and that one should be satisfied not to increase their amount during the treatment. This state of affairs wa s changed by the work of groups at the Univer- sity of Birmingham and at the Ames Laborato ry (Jones et al. 1978, Fort et al. 1981). Making use of technological developments associated with cold boat crucibles together with advances in vacuum technol ogy, particularly the use of ultrahigh vacuum equipment, the groups of D. Fort at the University of Birmingham and K.A. Gschneidner, Jr. at Ames were able to handle molten ra re earth without degradation during processing, and contributed to much of the current knowle dge on zone refining of rare earth metals. 5.8.2 Lanthanum, Gadolinium, and Terbium Commercially available lanthanum, gadolinium and terbium metals were zone refined by Jones et al. (1978) in water-cooled boats us ing radiofrequency heating. The lanthanum was zone refined in ultrahigh vacuum (working pressure ~10–8 Pa) while purified argon of equivalent purity was used for gadolinium and terbium. The use of argon moderated the vaporization problems, particularly with terb ium. The configuration of the boats was such that melting occurred right through the ingot. In the zone melting of lanthanum ~15 g pie ces of the metal were consolidated in the cold boat by a general melting. The start ma terial outgassed badly, and outgassing was05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 331 considered complete when the whole rod coul d be held molten in a vacuum better than 10–7Pa. The ingot length was 120 mm, zone wi dth was ~15 mm, and the zoning speed was 180 mm/h. After 33 zone passes, the ends were cropped for mass spectrographic analysis and the remaining rod (now 104 mm long) wa s treated further. The rod was replaced inverted and subjected to a further 30 zone pa sses at an average speed of 150 mm/h, while the vacuum remained better than 10–7 Pa during the whole zoning procedure.

The begi nning and end samples were actually cut 10 cm from the extremities of the ingots. The analysis of the zone-refined lanthanum is given in Table 5.16. In the refining of gadolinium and terbium, 120 g start material was consolidated and outgassed to a constant vacuum better than 1.3 ×10–5 Pa, as described for lanthanum. The ingots were then zone refined under static high purity argon. The zoning width was 15 mm, zoning speed was 250 mm/h, and the number of passes in each case was 25. The analysis after zone refining appears in Table 5.16. The results in the table show that in lanthanum, gadolinium, and terbium, zone refining results in redistribution of oxygen and nitrogen. After zoning, in each of the three cases, the maximum impurity concentration occu rred at the start end, thus indicating that these impurities had moved in the opposite di rection to that of zone travel. The hydrogen content showed no consistent segregation effect s, possibly because of the reversible nature of the rare earth/hydrogen reaction. Most of the metallic impurities had moved in the direction of the zone. The results indicated that zone refining can result in a greatly improved product, perhaps even on a commercial scale. 5.8.3 Lanthanum, Ceri um, and Gadolinium In experiments jointly conducted by groups from the University of Birmingham and the Ames Laboratory (Fort et al. 1981), a zone-refining apparatus constructed to ultrahigh vacuum standards was used to ultrapurify high pure Ames metals. The metals were lanthanum, cerium, and gadolinium. Only three rare earths — lanthanum, cerium, and praseodymium — have vapor pressures that are low enough at the melting points of themetals to allow conventional cold-boat zone refining in vacuum, and all other rare earth elements require an inert gas environment to suppress volatilization. The use of inert gas can result in contaminant introduction, but su ch contamination could be kept to acceptable levels provided no gaseous impurities leaked into the system during refining and provided that negligible degassing from the system walls into the argon occurred. The use of ultrahigh-vacuum-rated equipment and pump ing the system to a high vacuum before admitting argon help keeping cont amination to acceptable levels. Figure 5.9 Schematic drawing of the cold-boat zo ne refining assembly (Fort et al. 1981). 05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 333 A schematic diagram of the cold boat zone refining assembly used by Fort et al. (1981) is given in Figure 5.9. The assemblies were constructed using st ainless steel ultrahig h vacuum components and copper gaskets throughout . One assembly was evacuated using ion and sublimation pumps and the whole system was bakeable to 400°C. It has a base pressure of 2.6 ×10–8 Pa. This system was used for zone refining both in vacuum and under argon. Another cold boat assembly was evacuated by a diffusion-p umped vacuum system with a cryogenic trap. The assembly was leak te sted initially to 2.6 ×10–8 Pa, but the actual pumps had a base pressure of only 6.6 ×10–6 Pa. This assembly was used for zoning runs under argon. For zoning runs under inert gas, th e systems were filled with argon (to 1 atm) via an inert gas purifier specified to reduce the total amount of impurities to less than 1 vol. ppm. To induce the molten zone, induction heating at 350 kH z was used. A “double-pancake” type coil with six turns in two layers was used. The radio frequency power output was regulated to keep the molten zone lengths at approx imately 10% of the total bar length. Cerium has the lowest vapor pressure of al l the rare earth metals and would therefore exhibit the optimum potential for purification wi th respect to oxygen, nitrogen, or hydrogen when zone refined under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. During ultrahigh vacuum zone refining of cerium, Fort et al. (1981) experienced severe troub le in stabilizing the molten zone. The zone kept vibrating and touching the cold boat where it would freeze, then remelt, touch the boat, and freeze again. This stability problem was overcome when the cerium rod was zone refined under 1 atm pres sure argon. The rod was loaded into the diffusion pumped cold boat, the rod was de gassed by melting in a vacuum (initially 6.6×10–6 Pa but rising to 5 ×10–4 Pa during melting), and then purified argon was admitted to a pressure of 1 atm. The molten zone b ecame well defined (the melting–freezing cycles ceased) and a constant length and controlled zone refining was possible. At the rate of 12.7 cm h–1, a total of 15 zones were passed. The zone stability problem exhibited by ce rium in ultrahigh vacuum was also dis- played by lanthanum (Fort et al. 1981) experiments. However, previously commercial purity lanthanum had been zone refined (Jones et al. 1978) in ultrahigh vacuum without problems in stabilizing the molten zone. Stab ility of the molten zone appeared to be connected to material purity. The impurities in the metal influenc e the surface tension of the molten metal and hence affect the molten zone stability. An inert gas atmosphere may stabilize the molten zone by making the temp erature profile across the zone much sharper by increasing the heat losses from the nonheated parts of the bar and also by altering the surface characteristics of the molten metal. Fort et al. (1981) proceeded with zone refining of lanthanum in ultrahigh vacuum in spite of not achieving a stable molten zone . The refining run was composed of 14 zone passes at 18.7 cm h–1 and then 11 zone passes at 11.7 cm h–1. During zoning, the vacuum improved from 1.3 ×10–5 Pa during the initial pass to 5.3 ×10–7 Pa for the final 10 passes. Gadolinium could not be cold boat zone re fined in ultrahigh vacuum because of the metal’s high vapor pressure and hence it s excessive volatilization. Fort et al. (1981) zone refined Gd under inert gas. Two different vacu um treatments were given to Gd before argon was let in. In one, the starting material was degassed at red heat (~800°C) to a vacuum of 2.6×10–5 Pa before it was cooled to room temp erature and purified argon was admitted, and at 25.2 cm h–1, 20 zone passes were made. In the other treatment, the starting material was degassed to a vacuum of 2.6 ×10–7 Pa before admission of argon. Nine zones were run at 18.7 cm h–1 followed by 11 passes at 11.7 cm h–1. In another run, gadolinium containing 190 atomic ppm tungsten was zone refined, pr incipally to redistribute this impurity. The oooo05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 334 diffusion pumped cold boat system was used. After degassing the starting metal (to 6.6×10–6 Pa), purified argon was filled to 1 atm and first 20 zones were passed at 12.7 cm h–1 followed by 1 zone pass at 2.5 cm h–1. The last pass was to promote grain growth. The analyses of cerium, lanthanum, and gado linium before and after zone refining are listed in Table 5.17. The results show that in cerium and gadoliniu m, under the conditions used, the impurity levels rise or fall progressively from the beginning of the bar to the end. The results for lanthanum and cerium are show n in Figure 5.10. Unlike cerium, the results for lanthanum do not show a consistent trend, and this is traceable to the unstable molten zone. A stable molten zone is n ecessary for worthwhile refining. Redistribution of Interstitial Impurities Fort et al. (1981) observed that in the zone refining of gadolinium, terbium and lantha num, the impurities oxygen, hydrogen, andTable 5.17 Analysis of Ce, La, and Gd before and after zone refining (Fort et al. 1981), values in at. ppm Element Start After zone refining Beginning ¼ ½ ¾ End Lanthanum O 295 434 434 1215 564 174 H 275 965 1100 2338 2062 688 N 3 03 02 08 05 02 0 T a 3 . 44 14 03 33 6 2 2 0Cu 10 37 20 16 15 120 F e 1 05449 6 6 N i22112 1 0 Co <0.2 2 1 1 7 15 C l3 1 0 1 0775 Cerium O 395 1226 683 823 455 341H 556 1668 973 1112 417 139N 260 260 240 230 130 60 Gadolinium O 864 1770 894 648 432 304H 1092 780 780 780 468 312 N 34 190 101 101 45 56 C 367 262 367 524 616 1087W 190 <1 <1 55 33 1433 Fe 38 3 10 20 5 160 Al 10 <0.04 1 4 8 100Ta 11 <0.03 1 24 23 10 Si 5 <0.03 10 10 2 20 Co 2 <0.03 <0.05 <0.1 0.2 5Ni 3.2 <0.3 <0.3 3 0.8 1005 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 335 nitrogen moved against the zone directions. The impurity profiles for oxygen and carbon are shown in Figure 5.11. It is seen that unlike oxygen, car bon was found to move in the zone direction in gadolinium. It is thus not poss ible to decrease the levels of all four major interstitial impurities at one end of a gado linium bar by zone refining. Also, the lowest levels of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, an d nitrogen achieved by Fort et al. (1981) did not re- present significant improvements over the star ting concentrations. They also observed in the zone refining of gadolinium that ultrah igh vacuum degassing was advantageous before zoning under vacuum. Redistribution of Metallic Impurities Metallic impurities were found to be markedly redistributed in gadolinium by zone refining (Fort et al. 1981). The impurity profile in gadolinium after zone refining is shown in Fi gure 5.12. All three me tallic impurities shown — aluminum, iron, and tungsten — have under gone redistribution by zone refining and have concentrated at the end, leaving the por tion from the beginning to three-fourths of the bar enhanced in purity. Tungsten, iron, and al uminum move well, but zone refining has not been particularly effective for zirconium. In f act, the metallic impurities were so effectively redistributed by zone refining of gadolinium that Fort et al. (1981) achieved the total metallic impurity level in the beginning sectio n — the lowest ever recorded in a rare earth metal. From a starting concentration of 190 at ppm, zone refining left at least one-quarter of the bar with a tungsten content of less than 1 at ppm. In lanthanum, despite the instability of the molten zone, useful transport of me tallic impurities was observed (Fort et al. 1981). In the zone refining of rare earth metals, Fort et al. (1981) observed that the majority of the metallic contaminants we re transported in the zone dir ection. This was observed for iron, copper, cobalt, nickel, tantalum, tungsten, and aluminum. Such behavior can be anti- cipated because the binary phase diagrams of each of these metals with the rare earths showed eutectics adjacent to the pure rare earths due partly to the low solubility of most of these elements within the matrix of the large rare earth atoms. The lowering of the melting point of the host rare earth metal by small amounts of impurities led to the distribution coefficient ( keff) becoming less than one and, as a consequence, movement of impurity in the zoning direction.

Interestingly, the direction of transport of oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, which are present in considerable concentrations besides not Figure 5.11 Impurity profiles in zone-refined ga dolinium after 20 passes.

As a result, no part of the zone-refined bar is of greatly improved overall purity compared to the starting metal. This was stated clearly by Fort et al. (1981), see Figure 5.13. The inevitable conclusion is that zone refining is not a particularly viable method of refining rare earth metals with respect to all impurities. The ability of zone refining to refine rapi dly with respect to metallic impurities makes the technique still useful, particularly in comb ination with another technique that can refine with respect to the interstitia l impurities. Zone refining in combination with solid state electrotransport should enable producti on of very pure rare earth metals. 5.9 SOLID STATE ELECTROTRANSPORT It has been known for many years that foreign io ns in a metal lattice that is subjected to a direct current field display mobility (Jost 195 2). The mobility is more pronounced for the nonmetallic atoms, which can possibly migrat e interstitially in the metal, even though metallic impurities also move (Seith and We ver 1953). The remarkable mobility of oxygen in zirconium was reported as ear ly as 1940 by De Boer and Fast (1940). Inspired by this fact, Williams and Huffine (1959) at the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Department of General Electric Co. (ANPD–GE) examined th e technique in 1959 for the purification of yttrium. Figure 5.12 Profile of metallic impurities (a) aluminum, (b) iron and (c) tungsten in zone refined gadolinium. -------- starting levels (Fort et al. 1981).05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 338 Williams and Huffine (1959) electrolyzed yt trium bars of 9.5 mm and 19 mm in dia- meter in static argon using the vacuum ch amber of an arc melting furnace. The tem- peratures were 1370 and 1270°C, respectivel y, and the electrolysis lasted for 200 h. Water-cooled electrodes were fixed to the bars , and the bars were heated by the passage of direct currents of approximately 300 to 700 A. The results of electrolysis at the two temp eratures were similar, but the overall transport of impurities was better at the highe r temperature. This could be anticipated for a diffusional process. Data obtained at 1230° C are shown in Table 5.18. The movement of oxygen toward the anode was very marked. Th e movement of nitrogen, though in the same direction, was less pronounced. Many metal lic impurities also moved toward the anode. The solubility of oxygen in yt trium is low; however, the mo bility of what is dissolved is quite high. This leads to th e situation where the high mobili ty of dissolved oxygen results in dissolution of oxygen from the insoluble incl usion, resulting finally in the removal of the inclusion itself. The inclusions completely removed near the cathode appeared near the anode. These encouraging initial observations of Williams and Huffine (1959) laid the foundation of future work on this technique of purification of rare earth metals at Ames by ooo Figure 5.13 Sum of the oxygen, carbon, tungsten, ir on and aluminum impurity levels in zone refined gadolinium after 20 pass es. --------- starting concentrations, ____ calculated ultimate concentration distribution profile (Fort et al. 1981). 05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 339 Verhoeven, Carlson, Schmidt, Beaudry, and Gs chneidner and at the University of Birming- ham by Fort and Jones (Fort 1987; Fort et al. 1987, 1990; Jones et al. 1982). The solid state electrolysis (SSE) describe d by Huffine and Williams (1961) is more popularly known by the name solid state electro transport. In solid st ate electrotransport a direct current is passed through a rod or st rip of metal held between two electrodes in an appropriate container. Those impurities are am enable to transport and migrate to one end of the rod leaving the remainder enhanced in purity. During electrotransport, the impurities move under the influence of the electric field to one end of the bar. A greater electric field makes the impurities move faster. Jones et al. (1982) states this as the electron flow sweep ing the impurities (particularly the interstitial impurities O, H, N, and C) toward the anode end. The same electric current also (resistance) heats the metal rod (to near the melting point), enhancing the impurity transport rates. Since the passage of the electric current heats th e rod, however, the maximum field becomes limited by the rate at which the heat can be removed from the bar. The use of a higher electric field without leading to a rise in te mperature to unacceptable levels is favorable for SSE. The maximum temperature that can be accep table for using a higher electric field is limited by two factors. One is the melting point of the metal. The other is the vapor pressure of the metal being purified. When SSE is carried out under high vacuum, the heat is lost by radiation. When an inert atmosphere is used, cooling also occurs by conduction. When the rod is of a smaller diameter, the surface-to-vol ume ratio is greater, and this increases the cooling per unit length and permits an increas e in the electric field. A rod of smaller diameter also means processing less material. The extent of purification is often dete rmined by the surroundings. A vacuum of 1.3×10–7 Pa or an equally pure inert gas is th e minimum requirement for realizing the movement of gaseous impurities to one end of the metal by electrotransport faster than they enter the metal from the surroundings. The ends of the rod being purified by elect rotransport are usually cooler, and in this portion the transport would be slower. As a result there is a danger that the cooler end, from which the impurities are removed, will release or feed the impurities at a rate slower thanTable 5.18 Electrotransport purification of yttrium (Williams and Huffine 1959) Impurity Content before processing, ppmContent after processing, ppm Near cathode Center Near anode O 3330 665 3100 10900 N 510 366 570 700 Si 55 100 10 140 Fe 150 60 50 600M n 9< 1< 1 6 Mg 5 10 <5 6 Zr 9000 9000 9000 7000Ni 250 50 100 10000 Cr 80 20 20 30 B 736 1 5T i 9< 3< 33 0 C o 1< 1< 1 605 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 340 the rate at which the impurities are transporte d through the rest of the material. This end can continue to act as an impu rity source even after other portions have been purified. This limitation has been circumvented by butt weld ing a previously electrotransport purified rod to the end from which impurities are being removed. A concentration and chemical potential gradie nt is established along the length of the rod during electrotransport. This gradient will encourage back diffusion and this is another source of impurity. Verhoeven (1966) derived a theoretical expr ession to estimate the degree of purifica- tion attainable in SSE for a specified set of conditions. There are major limitations, how- ever, as described above, in achieving experi mentally what has been predicted by theory. In any case, purification by electrotranspor t can be enhanced by maximizing transport by an electric field, thereby minimizing contam ination from the surroundings and the cold end and finally minimizing diffusion of impurities. Another item is that solute mobilities are considerably higher in the bcc phase and when possible it is preferable to process the metal in the bcc phase. Following the initial work of Huffine and Williams (1961), many investigations have been carried out on the electrotransport puri fication of rare earth metals. A summary of electrotransport purification studies presented by Carlson and Schmidt (1976) has been updated with the later works and is given in Table 5.19. SSE has emerged as one of the major methods for purifying rare earth metals to the highest levels. It is practically indispensable in this role because the major contaminants in rare earth metals are invariably oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen. These four elements usually account for more than 95% of the impurities found in commercially obtainable rare earth metals. These interstit ial impurities are exactly those that are most amenable to electrotransport purification. Table 5.19 also summarizes purification achieved with respect to these impurities. 5.9.1 SSE System In SSE, ultrahigh vacuum rated equipment is always used to reduce environmental conta- mination risks even when processi ng under inert gas. Fort et al. (1987) used the hot chuck technique to maintain the sample at a unifor m temperature throughout its length. Here the sample holders were at a temperature simila r to the sample. While the basic ultrahigh vacuum chambers and power generators used for SSE have not changed much since the early days of SSE, the electrodes (or clamps or chucks or adaptors) that provide electrical contact between the sample and the main pow er feed through the chamber have become more sophisticated. The section of chuck adjo ining the sample should operate at within 100 K of the sample temperature, should no t contaminate the sample, should allow for length changes in the sample while heating and cooling, and should also carry high currents (~300 A). Tantalum is the preferred chuck ma terial because, among other things, in this metal oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen electromi grate from anode to cathode in the opposite direction to that of the rare earths. So, elect romigration of these impurities from the chucks into the purer (cathode) ends of th e rare earth samples is ruled out. The sample for solid state electrorefining wa s prepared by induction melting in a cold boat either under vacuum or purified argon fo llowed by mechanical sw aging. Single crystal rods grown by electron beam float zoning (EBF Z) in a vacuum (for Gd, Tb, and Y) or radio- frequency float zoning (RFFZ) under argon (fo r Gd, Tb, Y, Ho, and Dy) were also used.05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 341Table 5.19 Electrotransport purification of rare earth metals Rare earthAtmosphere Temperature, °CTime, hInitial concentration, ppm Initial RRRFinal concentration, ppm Final RRRReference C N O C N O Pr UHV Ames metal 400 Fort 1987 Nd UHV 860 1237 13 54 45 1 16 116 Carlson and Schmidt 1976 Nd Ar 800–863 1250 7 2 40 5 20 40 Fort et al. 1987 Gd UHV 1000–1050 2600 21 2 51 5 2 3 800 Fort et al. 1987 Tb UHV 1050 350 30 380 17.5 15 25 60 Jordon and Jones 1975 Tb UHV 985–1075 900 Ames metal 400 Fort 1987 Dy Ar 1050–1100 500 Ames metal 125 Fort 1987 Ho Ar 1100 200 Ames metal 90 Fort 1987 Lu UHV 1150 168 70 15 475 21 60 6 42 150 Peterson and Schmidt 1969 Y Ar 1230–1370 200 510 3330 90 340 Williams and Huffine 196105 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 342 When SSE processing was to be carried out under purified argon, the procedure (Fort 1987) involved (i) pumping a nd backing the system and sample assembly until the base pressure was 10–5 Pa, (ii) outgassing the sample and electrodes by passing a current through them, the temperature designed to be at tained being determined by the volatility of the element, (iii) admitting argo n into system to a pressure of about 70 kPa via an inert gas purifier designed to reduce the total of a ll gaseous impurities to below one volume ppm, (iv) performing the SSE processing, and (v) ev acuating the system to make sure no leaks had developed during processing. 5.9.2 Residual Resistivity Ratio The electrical resistivity, ρ, of metals at low temperatures is an excellent tool to determine impurity concentration in them (Schulze 1981 ). The residual resistivity ratio, RRR, is calculated as RRR = (ρ298 K – ρ4.2 K)/ρ4.2 K where ρ is the resistivity at the temperature gi ven as subscript. RRR is related to the impurity concentration, Ci, by Ci = K/RRR where K is a constant of proportionality. A high value of RRR is seen to indicate a low value of Ci and vice versa. 5.9.3 LanthanumThe solute mobilities are high in the bcc phase and this phase is stable in lanthanum above 1138 K. Fort (1987) conducted SSE processi ng of lanthanum above this temperature. To achieve steady state distribution of C and N, processing for 500 h was necessary. Oxygen distributes relatively more quickly in lanthanum. It is interesting to note that an attempt to SSE process a relatively impure lanthanum star t material led to run failure because a build up of impurities at the anode end led to a decr ease in the melting temperature of the region. After 120 h of SSE, the anode po rtion melted even at 1033 K. In an earlier investigation, Ames lantha num metal was SSE refined by Pan et al. (1980). The metal was refined to a resistance ratio of 260. 5.9.4 Praseodymium SSE processing has been carried out on pras eodymium by Fort (1987) using commercial metal as well as Ames metal as the start mate rial. When refining standard grade commercial praseodymium, impurity transport and precipitat ion resulted in failure by melting at that point. On the other hand, high purity commercial metal as well as Ames metal could be refined to RRR values of approximate ly 250 and over 400, respectively.05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 343 5.9.5 Neodymium The vapor pressure of neodymium at SSE proc essing temperatures is about two orders of magnitude higher than that of praseody mium. At temperatures approaching 1150 K, however, losses by volatilization were still no t too high. In a SSE-refined material starting from commercially available neodymium, anal ytical and metallographic evidence indi- cated impurity transport by SSE, but the RRR va lues showed no gradient along the length of the sample. The flat RRR profile was attrib uted to a minor substi tutional impurity that had a disproportionate effect on RRR and th at was not significantly transported during SSE. If the same material were zone refined and the substitutional impurity removed prior to electrotransport, RRR gradient appeared. As could be anticipated, SSE processing of Ames neodymium resulted in a product having RRR gradients with or without preliminary zone refining (Fort 1987). 5.9.6 Gadolinium Early work on successful purification of gado linium by the electrotransport technique was carried out by groups at the Ames Laboratory and the Materials Science Center, University of Birmingham. Using a purified helium atmosphere at 1245°C, Peterson and Schmidt (1972) obtained metal with a resistance ratio (R300 K /R4.2 K) of 405. Somewhat lower tem- perature and an ultrahigh vacuum were us ed by Jordon and Jones (1975) and the metal refined had a resistance ratio of 175. Fort (1987) noted that in the SSE purificatio n of gadolinium, two of its properties had to be allowed for. One is its comparatively high volatilit y and the other is the closeness of the hcp to bcc transformation temperature to the melting point. He estimated that several hundred hours of SSE at 1320 K would be re quired for oxygen to approach steady state conditions. Typically the SSE program for gadolinium consisted of 500 to 1000 h at 1273–1323 K followed by slow cooling to ro om temperature over about 100 h. Using a previously zone-refined Ames metal, the highest RRR value of 800 was obtained. 5.9.7 Terbium Jordon and Jones (1975) refined terbium by SSE under ultrahigh vacuum at 1050°C for 350 h. They prepared terbium of better than 99.9 at % purity from metal of commercial purity. The highest resistivity ratio obtained for the refined metal was 60 after a double processing treatment and 90 for the triple processed metal. Fort (1987) used single crystal rods gr own by electron beam float zone melting (EBFZ) and radiofrequency float zone me lting (RFFZ) of Ames metals, as starting material. For terbium, the highest RRR attain ed was more than 400 with initial SSE pro- cessing at 1348 K for 200 h followed by approximately 600 h at 1273–128 K and 100 h at 1258 K. At these temperatures, vo latilization rates were controllable. 5.9.8 Yttrium As described earlier, the technique of electro transport was first used by Williams and Huffine (1959) for a rare earth metal to refine yttrium. A purer grade of yttrium containing 05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 344 lower interstitial impurity re sulted from refining at a lowe r temperature under nearly 10–5 Pa vacuum, as compared to the product obtained from the first attempt (Carlson et al. 1966). Murphy et al. (1975) performed an interesti ng experiment in the electrotransport purifica- tion with a Y–2% Fe alloy. The alloy was el ectron transport purified at 1200°C for only 60 h. Even by this, the iron content of the entire cathode section decreased to below 0.01%. Carlson and Schmidt (1976) stated that electro transport should be a feasible method for purifying yttrium with respect to silver, nick el, and other fast diffusing metallic elements besides iron. The interstitial impurities carbon , nitrogen and oxygen also have favorable mobilities in yttrium and are removable to ve ry low concentration if ultrahigh vacuum was used and end effects and surface reactions were minimized. Fort (1987) considered 1390–1420 K as th e temperature at which the volatilization rates in a vacuum were acceptable for a processi ng time of 1000 h required for carbon and nitrogen impurities to closely approach steady state. Oxygen reached this state quickly. The highest RRR value of 800 (extrapolating to well over 1000 at the cathode end) was obtained with a high purity metal initially grown in to a single crystal rod using RFFZ. The RFFZ processing program, in turn, consisted of 75 0 h at 1373–1423 K, 300 h at 1273–1373 K, and cooling to room temperature over 240 h. 5.9.9 Dysprosium and Holmium Both dysprosium and holmium have moderately high vapor pressures. Fort (1987) noted that in processing them by SSE, an inert ga s environment is necessary. However, even with 100 kPa gas pressure, problems due to vola tilization did not disappear. One problem is whisker formation. During SSE, vaporization a nd recondensation onto the samples resulted in formation of dendritic whiskers on the sa mple surface. The 2–4 mm long whiskers form in dense clusters on parts of the sample and in these parts marked reduction in temperature was noticeable because of the cooling effect of the large surface area. Such whiskering, usually most severe toward the top of the sa mple, could be greatly reduced by slanting the sample at about 45° to the vertical, so that the vapor originating at the sample bottom rose away from the rest of the rod. Holding the sa mple horizontal was suspected to induce grain boundary sliding and hence not attempted. SSE processing of dysprosium, under 70 kP a argon pressure, was carried out by Fort (1987) keeping the temperature between 1323 and 1373 K and processing time to 500 h. Prior to and after the main processing under argon, the sample and clamps were degassed at 1073–1173 K in vacuum. A commercially pu re start metal, resublimed under ultrahigh vacuum conditions, was refined by SSE as above to obtain the lightest RRR of 125. In the case of holmium, an Ames metal, SSE processed at 1373 K for 200 h refined to RRR of 90. 5.9.10 Erbium The SSE of erbium has been descri bed in detail by Fort et al. (1990). Ames metal was used as the start material. The metal was cast into a crude rod in a cold boat using arc melting. The rod was mechanically swaged to a unif orm diameter of 7.1 mm except for one end, which was left slightly thicker. This thicke r section, which would run cooler during SSE and was less likely to melt in the event of ex cessive impurity build up, was intended to be 05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 345 the anode. The swaged rod was thoroughly cleaned, degassed, an d stress relieved at 850°C and mounted in the SSE equipment. To preven t whisker formation, as explained in dys- prosium processing, the sample was he ld at a 45° angle to the vertical. The entire SSE processing was carried out in six stages. Some of these stages were carried out in ultrahigh vacuum and some under argon. By SSE purification, the total impurity co ntent in erbium decreased from 921 ppm atomic in the start material to 338 ppm at omic in the purest (cathode) section. This represents a 63% decrease in the overall impur ity level. The resultant purity in the cathode end was 99.97 at % or 99.996 wt % compared to the start level purity of 99.91 at % or 99.988 wt %. In fact, the cathode end of the SSE refined rod represents the lowest impurity concentration ever reported for erbium. Oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen electromigra ted in erbium, as expected, toward the anode. Oxygen was the main contaminant at 640 ppm atomic in the start material. This level decreased in the cathode end to 200 at pp m after three stages of processing and to 168 ppm after six stages. The start value of nitrogen was 48 pp m atomic (4 ppm weight) and after six stages of processing, the N content at the cathode was below the limit of detection (1 wt ppm) and there was a progressive increase along the length of the sample from the cathode to the anode. In the start metal, the H content was below the detection limit. But at the end of SSE, the H level was 1500 ppm at omic (9 ppm weight) at the anode end while the H contents at other positions were below the detection limit. Some H contamination had occurred during SSE and H had then migrated toward the anode. Carbon concentration in the start metal was 97 ppm atomic, but at the end of SSE the value at the cathode was 111ppm atomic. Carbon did not show a progress ive increase in concentration from cathode to anode even though the level was lowest at the anode. Some carbon contamination of the sample had occurred during the SSE procedure, most likely during the preparation of the SSE rod and by the degassing of carbonaceous gases from the furnace walls. The final high carbon value was 306 at ppm in the center section and 195 ppm atomic at the anode. Fluorine is another intractable impurity in erbium, and it s content in the SSE refined erbium rod showed no constant trend alon g the rod length. This, most probably, is connected with possible inhomog eneous distribution of fluorine in the start metal. Fluorine contamination is a factor in erbium because the vapor pressures of ErF 3 and Er are compar- able. Therefore during pyrovacuum refining, the fluoride tends to cosublime, and the sublimate collected first will have a highe r F content than the one collected later. For the metallic impurities, no consistent trend was generally apparent, possibly due to their presence in relatively low concentratio ns. Overall SSE is significant as the final step in the preparation of high purity erbium. 5.9.11 Lutetium Carlson et al. (1973) purified lutetium by SSE. A rod of lutetium, 2.5 mm in diameter and 153.5 mm long was SSE purified at 1150°C for 168 h in an all-metal ultrahigh vacuum chamber under 3.3 ×10–8 Pa. The impurities profile of th e rod and corresponding resistance ratios obtained by Carlson et al. (1973) are shown in Figure 5.14. They noted that there is a correlation between the resistance ratio an d oxygen content of lutetium because the carbon and nitrogen content remained constant along the length of the rod. Peterson and Schmidt (1969) had predicted a favorable purifi cation factor but low mo bility for carbon at a temperature of 1150°C resulting in a long time for carbon to reach steady state. Even05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 346 though conditions for the removal of oxygen a nd nitrogen were stated to be favorable, as shown in Figure 5.14, the only redistri bution of oxygen was actually observed. 5.9.12 Samarium Samarium is volatile. Its vapor pressure at it s melting point is approximately two orders of magnitude higher than dysprosium and holmium . Even under 70 kPa argon, the maximum temperature at which SSE processing of Sm could be carried out was 710–720°C, more than 350°C below its melting point. At these relatively low temperatures, whisker Figure 5.14 Concentration profile and resistance rati o of lutetium rod after purification by electrotransport at 1175 °C for 160 h (Carlson et al. 1973).05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 347 formation was a problem, and even after 200 h no significant purification was detected by Fort (1987). In other words, SSE was no t successfully applied to samarium because volatilization could not be sufficiently suppressed. Electrotransport refined the maximum number of rare earth metals and in the process obtained some of the rare earths in their pu rest known states. However, Fort (1987) stated that SSE was a viable method of turning good quality metal into very good quality metal but was not a successful meth od for improving the purity of poorer quality start metals because the build up of impurities resulted in melt-through. While commenting on the potential of SSE processing for rare earth el ements in the context of vaporization problems encountered, Fort (1987) observed th at the vapor pressure should be 10–4 Pa or less when processing under vacuum and 0.5 Pa or less wh en processing under 70 kPa of argon, at the chosen SSE processing temperature. Among the rare earth elements not covered above, cerium and possibly scandium should be amen able to SSE processing in vacuum. Refining of scandium and europium under 70 kPa argon should be possible. It is not possible to SSE refine thulium and ytterbium. 5.10 ZONE REFINING AND ELECTROTRANSPORT Electrotransport is the ultrapurification method effective for redistri bution of interstitial impurities, and zone refining redistributes subs titutional or metallic impurities effectively. In the ultrapurification of rare earth metals, refining has to be accomplished with respect to both the metallic and nonmetallic (interstitia l) impurities. For this, in the overall sequence of ultrapurification, zone refining is follow ed by electrotransport. This sequence has been extensively investigated by Fort et al. (1987) for neodymium and gadolinium metals. 5.10.1 Neodymium Fort et al. (1987) have described the ultrapurification of neodymium by zone refining followed by electrotransport. A bar of ne odymium weighing about 92 g was degassed in the cold boat (of zone-refining eq uipment) at red heat and 2.6 ×10–7 Pa. The system was then filled with purified argon and subjected to zone refining (25 molten zones were passed at the rate of 11.7 cm h–1). Matter transport also occurre d during the process and the beginning of the rod became significantly thicke r than the end. It was removed, swaged to a diameter of 8 mm, and its ends were croppe d because zone transported impurities would have accumulated in the ends. The rod was then cleaned, placed in the cold boat, degassed in vacuum to red heat, backfilled with argon and zone refined (14 molten zones were passed at 11.7 cm h–1). It was again removed, swaged to a diameter of 6.4 mm, its ends cut off because impurities had accumulated there, and the remaining, middle portion, of the rod was subjected to SSE. The “beginning” end from zone refining wa s made the cathode in SSE because during zone refining most metallic impurities would have transported to the “end” end. Moreover, interstitial impurities would migrate from th e cathode end to the anode end during SSE. Purification of neodymium by SSE was done under purified argon. The SSE processing consisted of an initial outgassing of the sa mple in a vacuum at 830°C for 144 h followed by the main run in 50 ×103 Pa purified argon at >863°C, 820–863°C, and 800°C, for a total oooo05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 348 of 755 h SSE under argon. The processing did not result in any dramatic increase of RRR. After cropping the anode end where impurities had accumulated, Fort et al. (1987) processed by SSE in a vacuum. The run lasted for a total of 1060 h of which for 412 h the sample temperature was above 863°C. Th e analysis is given in Table 5.20. Among the metallic impurities, iron migrated to the anode end while tantalum had also distributed. The tantalum content of the st art material was 88 at ppm. This content decreased to 60 at ppm at the cathode and to progressively lower levels in the center and the anode end. The indication is that tantalum was transported against the zone direction during zone refining. The decreas e in iron content from an initia l 11 at ppm to a final 0.6 at ppm at the cathode could have occurred by zone refining, but this conclusion could not be stated with certainty because iron is k nown to electromigrate rather quickly for a substitutional solute in many rare earth metals. The interstitial impurities migrated toward the anode, as expected, during SSE. The carbon content indicated possible pick up of carbon from swaging and cleaning operations involving the use of hydrocarbons as lubric ants or solvents. The overall impurity content decreased from about 1160 at ppm in the start material to approximately 330 at ppm at the cathode section after SSE. This corresponds to an improvement in purity from 99.88 at % to 99.97 at %. Much of the impurity content was as interstitial impurities O, H, N, and C. They together constituted 1036 at ppm and by combined zone refining and SSE, princi- pally by the latter, their content decreased to 244 at ppm, at the cathode end. As pointed out earlier, the low impurity content of ne odymium is not reflected in its RRR of theTable 5.20 Analysis of zone refined and electrotransported neodymium (Fort et al. 1987) bl: below limits of detection.Element Start, at ppm After zone refining and SSE, at ppm Cathode Center Anode O 360 180 239 360 H 571 bl bl 143 N 21 bl 31 165 C 84 64 312 480 Ta 88 60 40 21 Fe 11 <0.6 1 16 Cu 3 2 3 0.7 Cr 2.6 <0.5 <0.06 <0.4 Se 4.3 8 5.4 8.2 Ce 3.6 4.7 6.3 5 Tb <2 4 5 4 Si <6 4 2 4 Gd <3 <2 3 1.6 Cl 6 10 4 4 All impurities <1166 <336 <652 <1212 Metallic impurities <124 <82 <66 <60 O+H+N+C 1036 244 582 1148 Atomic percent 99.88 99.97 99.93 99.8805 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 349 purified samples, values that probably rema in low because of reasons other than impurity concentration. 5.10.2 Gadolinium Fort et al. (1987) have purified gadolinium by zone refining followed by electrotransport, enhancing, in the process, the purity from 99. 75 at % to 99.94 at %. The procedure adopted is similar to that used for neodymium, using ultrahigh vacuum rated equipment. A bar of gadolinium (Ames metal) weighing 110 g was degassed at red heat in a cold boat to a vacuum of 2.6 ×10–7 Pa. The system was backfilled w ith pure Ar to 100 kPa, and zone refining was conducted with nine successive molten zone passes at a rate of 18.7 cm h–1 followed by nine passes at 11.7 cm h–1. A significant amount of material transport back toward the beginning of the bar occurred during zone refining and this is shown schematically in Figure 5.15. Port ions marked A in the figure accumulated impurities transported to the “beginning” en d of the zone-refined bar and had the highest O and N levels. That section was discarded. Virtually all iron, tungsten, aluminum and copper impurities accumulated in sections D and E and these were also discarded. Parts marked B and C had the lowest overall impu rity contents after zone refining. Those portions were cut, remelted into a rod about 100 mm long, swaged to a diameter of 6.4 mm, cleaned, degassed, and again remelted in on e quick zone pass. This rod was taken for refining by SSE. Gadolinium is a relatively volatile me tal which restricts the temperature and/or duration of SSE refining in vacuum. The elect romigration velocities of oxygen, carbon and nitrogen are higher in the bcc phases (above 1235°C), but at such temperatures vaporization Figure 5.15 Schematic diagrams showing the size and shape changes of the gadolinium sample (1) after zone refining, (2) after remelti ng parts B and C and swaging, (3) after first stage of SSE, and (4) after final stage of SSE. Sections marked black were discarded before the next stage of processing. The tantalum end rods screwed onto the sample to act as current carriers during SSE are also shown (Fort et al. 1987). 05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 350 of gadolinium would severely curtail run durati on. Hence processing has to be done in the α hcp phase, and the temperature chosen by Fort et al. (1987) was 1030–1040°C. The total processing time for the entire run, which was done in two parts, including initial degassing, warming up, and cooling down, was 2600 h. The RRR profile of the SSE refined gadolini um rod is given in Figure 5.16. The measured best value of RRR near the cathode was 730 and the extrap olated value at the extreme cathode end was 800, the highest re sistance ratios reported for gadolinium. The purest portion was the cathode end. The analys is of gadolinium purified by zone refining followed by SSE is given in Table 5.21. By zone refining followed by SSE, the overall impurity level in gadolinium had decreased from 2480 at ppm (in the start meta l) to 597 at ppm at the cathode section. In other words, the gadolinium purity had impr oved from 99.75 at % to 99.94 at %. Much of the impurity content given above is due to hydrogen, which in the start material was 1560 at ppm (10 wt ppm) and decreased to 468 (3 wt ppm) at ppm. If impurities other than hydrogen are considered, the initial value was 921 at ppm, and after zone refining and after SSE it was 129 at ppm. The oxygen content was 550 at ppm in the st art material. It decreased marginally to 500 at ppm in the purest region after zone re fining, and came down to as low as 29 at ppm at the cathode end after SSE. Carbon zone refined in the zoning direction and electro- migrated toward the anode. The effects of both these techniques worked in the same direction. Yet the content decreased from 320 at ppm in the start material to only 60 at ppm, at the cathode end. Maximum purification with respect to carbon occurred during SSE. If metallic impurities alone were considered, th e improvement was from 40 at ppm to less than 17 at ppm. Iron was transported by both th ese techniques and decreased from 10 at ppm ooooooo Figure 5.16 The final resistance ratio ( ρ293 K /ρ4.2 K) profile along the zone refined and electrotransport purified gadolinium (Fort et al. 1987). 05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 351 in the start material to 0.22 at ppm at th e cathode end. Zirconium moved in both zone refining and electrotransport, but these had not markedly decreased its content. 5.11 IODIDE REFINING The iodide refining process, developed in 1925 by Van Arkel and de Boer (1925), has been successfully applied to the refining of several reactive and refractory metals. The process is carried out by heating the impure metal with iodine in a closed system. A volatile iodide of the metal is formed, and this iodide is d ecomposed on contact with a hot wire whereby the pure metal deposits on the wi re and the released iodine retu rns to react with more of the crude metal. Two general criteria must be met before a metal is considered for iodide refining (Loonam 1959). One is that the metal must be capable of existin g as a condensed phase (solid or liquid) at some temperature and pressure in equilibrium with a gas (gaseousTable 5.21 Analysis of gadolinium purified by zone refining and electrotransport (Fort et al. 1987) Values in at ppm Element Start After zone refining After SSE cathode end Begin ¼ ½ ¾ End O 550 658 457 378 304 363 29 H 1560 468 390 468 390 780 468 N 1 1 3 91 71 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 C 320 210 288 341 419 563 60Fe 10 1 0.3 2.5 68 900 0.22 W 5 <2 <1 <1 8 140 4.3 Al 4 <0.2 0.6 1 6 50 <0.07Si 2 <0.5 <0.4 <0.4 2 40 0.84 Ti 2 <0.2 <0.1 0.9 7 18 <0.08 Cr 2 <0.5 <0.6 <0.6 4 10 0.37Ni 8 0.3 0.03 0.1 <0.4 20 0.17 Zr 9 12 9 15 60 60 5.7 Cu 2 0.4 0.2 0.3 10 200 0.13Ce 0.4 0.4 0.1 0.2 0.6 0.6 1.7 Hg 1 2 <0.02 <0.05 <0.3 1 2.1 Ta 2 <0.4 <0.3 <0.3 3 6 1.9 Cl nd 5 6 4 20 9 0.63 All impurities 2481 <1398 <1171 <1224 1318 3171 597 Metallic impurities 40 <18 <13 <22 169 1445 18 O+H+N+C 2441 1375 1152 1198 1129 1717 579 Atomic percent 99.75 99.86 99.88 99.88 99.87 99.68 99.9405 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 352 iodide) of high atomic ratio of iodine to meta l. The second criterion is the capability of the metal to react readily with the gaseous pr oduct of the deposition reaction at the same pressure but a different temperature to yield a gaseous product of low atomic ratio of iodine to metal. It is also desirable that the metal have a high melting point and low vapor pressure. These aid in the deposition of th e metal as a solid. The iodide refining is most likely to be feasible with metals that form tri-iodide and tetraiodide becau se the large positive entropy changes on dissociation lead to an overall d ecrease in free energy of dissociation with increasing temperature. In other words, the me tals least likely to be amenable to refining are those that form monoiodides that remain monomeric and stable in the vapor phase. According to Loonam (1959), the monoiodides of rare earth metals would be sufficiently stable to prevent dissociation, and this observation has been confirmed by the data of Scaife and Wylie (1958). In addition, the generally hi gh volatilities of rare earth metals are not very favorable for iodide refining because at the high temperature needed for the dissociation of the iodide the deposited metal would vaporize. Foster et al. (1952) used a modified Van Arkel– de Boer process for deposition of lanthanum, the least volatile of the rare earths. The iodide was formed by reaction of iodineand aluminum on lanthanum oxide. At 1000°C the dissociation of iodide was negligible and only slightly improved at 1800°C. Only small amounts of lanthanum were detected on the wire, and even this deposit was contaminated with aluminum. The deposition of yttrium from both bromid e and iodide was also attempted by Frazier (Huffine and Williams 1961). The bulb temperature (iodide formation) was between 300 to 350°C, and the molybdenum filament temp erature (iodide decomposition) was between 600 and 1600°C. No deposit was formed which suggested that it was not possible to deposit rare earth metals by the Van Arkel–de Boer process. 5.12 MISCELLANEOUS PROCESSES Many techniques, not covered above, have been applied for the purification of one or more rare earth metals. One is based on amalgamation of rare earth metals or the hydrides. This technique has been used by Schumacher an d Harris (1926) and Audrieth (1939). While mercury wets the rare earth metals and hydr ides and forms amalgams, the oxides, carbides, and halides remain insoluble in mercury and could be separated by underpouring orfiltration. Warf et al. (1953, 1957) have shown that the hydrides of lanthanum, cerium, and ytterbium were wetted by mercur y, whereas the oxide and other impurity inclusions floated on the amalgam. The metal has to be in a fi nely divided form for efficient amalgamation, which can be accomplished by forming the brittle hydride and grinding. After the flotation, mercury and hydrogen were removed by vacu um distillation and pure rare earth metal powder was obtained. Rare earth metals readily form relatively st able hydrides. This fact was sought to be exploited in a technique where hydrogen was to be introduced into a low melting rare earth alloy to selectively precipitate the rare earth hydride. The hydride would then be separated from the melt by filtering or decantation and vacuum distilled to remove hydrogen and produce the metal powder. This technique wa s used successfully for thorium, but the experiments of Frazier (Huffine and Williams 1961) with a low melting alloy of yttrium, aluminum, and magnesium were inconclusive. 05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 353 5.13 SUMMARY As-reduced rare earth metals are usually 98 to 99% or at best 99.5% pure. A number of processes may be used to refine and ultrarefine these metals to as high as 99.99 at % purity. The nature and concentration of impurity to be removed, the final purity level desired in the refined metal, and the physical properties of the metal itself determine the refining techniques to be used. Complete purification is not achieved by any one refining technique and, as a rule, a sequence of processes has to be applied to remove all the impurities. Impurities in the as-reduced rare earth me tals originate from many sources. The most important sources are the starting materials, namely, the rare earth compound intermediate and the reductant. Also important is the en vironment in which reduction is carried out, namely, the gaseous atmosphere or the residual gases in the atmosphere if the process is conducted in a vacuum, as well as the containe r for reduction. Any other rare earth present in the rare earth that is currently processe d is also an impurity, but the presence of such impurity rare earths in a given rare earth meta l has to be controlled in the separation stage itself before the metal reduction. The impuri ties originating from the starting materials are calcium, lithium, magnesium, cerium, zirconi um, thorium, zinc, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, fluorine, chlorine, and oxygen. Th e impurity content of the final metal is determined by the purity of the raw materi als, the processes used for converting raw materials to interprocess intermediates for redu ction, and the reduction process itself. The impurities oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon usually originate from the atmosphere in which the processes are carried out. Crucib les for reduction come into intimate contact with the metal being reduced, undergo corrosion or dissolution, and end up as an impurity in the metal. Iron, silicon, carbon, titanium, zirconium, molybdenum, and tantalum are examples of impurities that en d up in the metal this way. There are two major methods of impurity re moval from as-reduced metals. In the first type to which most of the conventional puri fication techniques belong, the impurities are eliminated from the metal. In the second type , to which most of the ultrapurification techniques belong, the impurities are not completely separated from the metal but are redistributed so that one physical portion of th e metal is substantially purer than the other portion. Both in purification and ultrapurific ation, high vacuum or ultrahigh vacuum is used as the environment not only for preven ting atmospheric impurities from coming into contact with the metal undergoin g refining, but also to effect removal of impurities from the metal. Pyrovacuum treatment, in which the metal is heated to temperatures up to and above its melting point under high vacuum in a ta ntalum crucible, is the most important and effective means available for the purification of rare earth metals. In vacuum melting, purification occurs because the impurities va porize, leaving behind the purer metal. In vacuum distillation or sublimation, the metal it self is vaporized off to condense as a purer product, leaving behind impurities in the residue. The rare earths lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium all have very low vapor pressures, and vacuum melting and vacuum remelting complete the purificat ion operation. In the case of gadolinium, terbium, yttrium, and lutetium, the vapor pressures are relatively higher and vacuum melting is followed by vacuum distillation . The metals scandium, erbium, holmium, and dysprosium are more volatile and can be pu rified by vacuum melting followed by vacuum sublimation. In the case of the four most vo latile rare earth metals, europium, samarium,05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 354 ytterbium, and thulium, no vacu um melting is done and purifi cation is effected exclusively by vacuum sublimation. The pyrovacuum tr eatments are carried out in induction- or resistance-heated furnaces using tungsten or ta ntalum as a container for most of the metals and also in electron beam melting furnaces for yttrium. Electrorefining in an inert atmosphere elec trolysis cell, as a process for rare earth metal purification, has been applied for the pu rification of yttrium and gadolinium, the two metals that are most difficult to obtain by exclusive pyrometallurgy routes. When refined in a LiCl–YCl3 bath the metallic impurities were removed, whereas refining in a LiF–YF3 bath led to the removal of oxygen in addition to the metallic impurities. In the electro- refining of gadolinium the electrolyte invariably contained GdF3 in addition to LiF. The electrorefined metal contained less oxygen , but the final oxygen concentration is determined by the oxide and hydrox ide impurities in the electrolyte. Further removal of impurities, the bulk of which have already been eliminated in pyrovacuum treatments, is achieved by the ul trapurification techniques of zone refining and electrotransport. Zone refining is useful for bringing down the levels of metallic impurities, particularly tantalum and tungsten picked up by the meta ls during pyrovacuum refining. In zone refining of rare earth metals , the use of a high vacuum or an equally pure inert atmosphere is mandatory to prevent the metal from picking up impurities from the gaseous atmosphere. Two techniques have been used. In one the metal is contained in a long horizontal trough or crucible, and the zone is moved in a horizontal direction. In the other, the metal is supported vertically fro m the ends without a container, the narrow molten zone being maintained because of th e surface tension of the metal. Heating is by induction or preferably by an electron beam. Much of the early work on zone refining was done on yttrium but later works focused attention on lanthanum, cerium, gadolinium, and te rbium. Metallic impurities such as iron, copper, cobalt, nickel, tantalum, tungsten and aluminum are transported efficiently in the zone direction. As it is, these elements are not originally present in high concentrations. The direction of transport of oxygen, hydrogen, an d nitrogen is opposite to the direction of transport of common metallic impurities. Th ese three impurities are usually present in considerable concentration and also do not transp ort efficiently. As a result, no part of the zone-refined bar is of greatly improved overall purity compared to the starting metal. The ability of zone refining to refine rapidly with respect to metallic impurities, however, makes the technique useful particularly in combinati on with another technique that can refine with respect to the interstitial impurities. Zone refining in combination with solid state electrotransport enabled production of rare earth metals with the lowest possible impurity content. In solid state electrotransport, a direct current is passed through a rod or strip of metal held between two electrodes in an ultrahi gh vacuum rated container. During electro- transport the impurities move under the influe nce of the electric field and when held for sufficient time accumulate at one end or anothe r of the bar, leaving the remainder enhanced in purity. The electric current also heats the me tal rod to near the melting point, and the high temperature enhances the impurity transport ra tes. The vapor pressure of the metal at the electrotransport temperature determines whether the process is carried out in ultrahigh vacuum or under an equivalently pure inert gas cover. The technique was first applied to purify yttrium and subsequently to purify lanthanum, praseodymium, neodymium, gado- linium, terbium, erbium, and lutetium, cerium, and scandium. Purification by this technique is very difficult for samarium and europi um and impossible for thulium and ytterbium.05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMREFINING RARE EARTH METALS 355 Oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen account for more than 95% of the impurities found in commercially obtainable rare earth metals and these are the elements most amenable to electrotransport purification. It is a slow process and works on relatively small samples, and only a portion of the sample is left in a highly purified condition. Zone refining is also a process of refining by impur ities redistribution, particularly of substitu- tional impurities, and the combined zone refi ning electrotransport operation finally results in only a small portion of the metal in a highly purified state with respect to all impurities. Such very high purity metals ha ve been invaluable for research. Some more techniques including iodide re fining have been attempted for rare earth metals, but the results were unsuccessful or inconclusive. The sequence of vacuum melting, vacuum distillation/vacuum sublimation, zone refining, and electro transport remains the technically perfect route for the conversion of as-reduced rare earth metals to the purest possible rare earth metals.05 Chapter 5 291-35 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:45 PMCHAPTER 6 Rare Earth Materials 6.1 INTRODUCTION Rare earths-containing end product materials for commercial use or for research applications are numerous. A complete descript ion of the most important of these materials was given in the section on applications of ra re earths in Chapter 1. These materials can be basically divided into two groups. One group comprises commercially used rare earthcompounds, alloys, and metals, while the other group comprises rare earth-bearing products obtained using rare earth compounds , alloys, and metals as the interprocess intermediates. This chapter focuses on the pr eparation of the commercially used rare earth compounds, alloys, and metals. Several materi als, for example, rare earth compounds such as the chloride, hydroxide, fluoride, oxide, an d carbonates, figure as intermediates obtained during routine processing or by processes r eadily branched from the regular flowsheet. The preparation of these compounds was theref ore included in the chapter on resource processing. Preparation of elemental rare earth s was covered in the preceding two chapters, which also included certain references to the preparation of rare earth alloys either because the processes used were very similar or because the alloys happened to be intermediates for the preparation of pure metals. The materials covered in this chapter are specific specialty alloys of rare earths, starting from misch metal and including rare earth–iron–silicon alloys, yttrium–aluminum alloys, lanthanum–nickel alloys, permanent magnet materials based on samarium and onneodymium, and magnetostrictive, and magnet ocaloric materials. Many rare earth com- pounds have emerged as special performance ma terials in a range of new technology areas. Their preparative aspects have also been described. 6.2 MISCH METAL Misch metal is the material containing, in meta llic form, the mixed light rare earths in the same or slightly modified ratio as found in the resource minerals. The composition of the 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 358 misch metal depends on the source from which it is derived. Misch metal obtained from a monazite source is relatively high in neod ymium and praseodymium, whereas the misch metal from a bastnasite source is high in lanthanum but low in neodymium and praseo- dymium. Traditionally, monazite was the source of rare earths (Morrice and Knickerbocker 1961). In the 1890s monazite was processed fo r the extraction of thorium as thorium nitrate, which was used in Auer gas mantles. The residue remaining after thorium extraction contained cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, pr aseodymium, and other rare earth compounds in minor amounts but was discarded. Auer Von Welsbach first found that a pyrophoric metal (misch metal) could be prepared from th is residue. In 1908 he founded the Treibacher Chemical Works in Austria and started commerc ial production of misch metal. The metal’s pyrophoric properties were of use in making lighter flints. Soon, monazite was processed principally as a source for misch metal. Starti ng in 1949, when a large bastnasite deposit was discovered in Mountain Pass, California, bastnasite was also processed as a source for misch metal. Presently, misch metal is obtaine d from both monazite and bastnasite sources. The processes used are fused salt electrolysis or thermal reduction. Misch metal is commercially produced in t onnage quantities by fused salt electrolysis of anhydrous chlorides (Hirschhorn 1968). Sp ecific details of these commercial operations have not been revealed, but several descript ions of procedures and equipment have been published. 6.2.1 Preparation of Mixed Rare Earth Chlorides Commercial production of misch metal is base d on the use of mixed rare earth chloride, RECl3. In the past, all mixed rare earth chloride was obtained by wet chemical treatment of monazite and bastnasite, in the form of a hydr ated product. This hydrated product contained about 30% H2O and was treated to yield an anhy drous product with low oxychloride content, for electrowinning. Dehydration wa s accomplished using methods that minimize oxidation or hydrolysis. Typically, dehydration techni ques involved the use of vacuum heating of hydrated mixed rare earth chloride or heating them in air with an admixture of certain nonrare earth salts. The additives were meant to reduce hydr olysis. During World War II, one supplier to the German misch metal industry (the Auergese llschaft in Berlin) used rotary iron vacuum drum dryers that were steam heated to 350°C at a vacuum level of 93 ×103 Pa. The anhydrous chloride was reported to contain 1. 5% oxychlorides (Livingston and Kent 1946). In another method, the chloride was melted in a cast iron, steel or ceramic vessel from which air was largely excluded (Kremers 1954) . Heating was carried on until a porous, solid, nearly anhydrous product was obtain ed. The product had up to 10% of water insoluble basic chloride content. Heating a mixture of rare earth chloride with CaCl2 in air for 2 to 2½ h was practiced at Prometheus in Bavaria (Hirschhorn 1968) . The yield was usually 62%. This indicates that there was obviously substantial oxychl oride content in the product. A two-stage vacuum drying process was used at Treibach er Chemische Werke in Austria. The hydrate was heated first at 170°C and then at 350°C (Livingston and Kent 1946). In certain commercially adopted dehydrati on techniques (Hir schhorn 1968), ammo- nium chloride was added to the hydrated chloride to reverse the hydrolysis, according to the following reactions:06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 359 RECl3 + 3H2O → RE(OH)3 + 3HCl RE(OH)3 + 3NH4Cl → RECl3 + 3NH3 + 3H2O In an industrial practice, to carry out dehydration (RECl3.6H2O) was quickly heated to 400 to 500°C with NH4Cl in an inert atmosphere. Some producers used sodium or calcium chlo ride to retard hydrolysis on the basis of the common chloride ion mass action effe ct. The addition of NaCl and/or CaCl2 to the electrolyte was usually desirable, and their in corporation into the feed during dehydration was convenient. Apart from the route that involves prepar ation of a hydrated chloride and its subsequent dehydration, there are other pro cesses for obtaining the anhydrous chlorides directly from the mineral. Th. Goldschmidt AG at Essen in Germany uses chlorination of monazite or bastnasite to produce anhydrous rare earth chlorides (Brugger and Greinacher 1967). The product is suitable, without any further processing, for electrolysis to misch metal. The analysis of this chloride (Hirsch horn 1967) is given in Table 6.1 along with the analysis of chlorides from the wet proces sing of both monazite and bastnasite. 6.2.2 Electrolysis of Chlorides Two types of cells have been used for the pr oduction of misch metal by chloride electro- lysis (Singer et al. 1945, Livingston and Kent 1946). Details of these cells are given in Figures 6.1 and 6.2 and listed in Table 6.2.

The electrical connection to the cathode was given through tw o water-cooled steel blocks inserted in the cell walls. The anode was 50 cm in diameter and 1 meter long and was made of amorphous carbon. The anode could be raised and lowe red into the electrolyte. They were usually operated in series to facilitate semicontin uous production. Molten electrolyte was trans- ferred from one cell to another for rapid start up. During operation, misch metal collected at the bottom of the cell where it was kept in the molten state by the flow of direct current through it to the cathode. At suitable interval s, the metal that was covered with a layer of molten electrolyte was ladled out and poured into molds. The metal solidified in the mold oooo Figure 6.1 Electrolysis cell at Treibacher Chemische Werke, Austria (Morrice and Wong 1979).

After cooling, the solidified electrolyte was broken off and the metal was separated and washed. The cell shown in Figure 6.2 also has a re fractory lined steel ve ssel to contain the molten bath (Hirschhorn 1967). The cathode was an iron block at the bottom of the con- tainer. Several graphite rods extended vertica lly into the cell through its top and served as anodes. Unlike the cell given in Figure 6.1, the cell in Figure 6.2 was tiltable (Livingston and Kent 1946). This arrangement simplifie d pouring of the product into molds. Contamination of the misch metal product due to iron and silica could be decreased by constructing cells of graphite. When mi sch metal contaminated with iron was accept- able, as for example, misch metal for ferrous alloy applications, iron pots could be used instead of graphite (Greinacher 1970). Before electrolysis a mixture of anhydrous rare earth chloride, NaCl, KCl, or CaCl2 was charged into the pot. In one procedure, the charge was melted by external burners. Inanother procedure, the anodes were lowered in to the cell until they contacted broken pieces of cerium kept at the bottom of the pot. The solid bath consti tuents were then packed around the bottom of the anodes. The direct current was turned on and after sufficient electrolyte had been melted, the anodes were raised to begin electrolysis. The chloride bathtemperature was raised to 800 to 900°C by pa ssage of electric current. During electrolysis additional external heating was not required. The cells could be enclosed by steel cove rs so that air was excluded. This would decrease gas content in the misch metal prod uced. The gaseous products of electrolysis, comprising mainly chlorine mixed with ga seous carbon compounds, were drawn off and treated by absorption in a suitable off-gas treatment system to decrease air pollution. The electrolysis was usually continued as lo ng as the current efficiency remained high and metal quality was satisfactory. Generally, the current efficiencies of the commercial cells described for misch metal production are low. This is in part due to the energy consumption for maintenance of cell temper ature and also due to the accumulation of compounds of samarium, europium, and other nonreducible rare ea rth compounds in the electrolyte (Hirschhorn 1967). The product was collected at the bottom of the cell where it could be maintained in the molten state by resi stance heating or allowed to solidify by usingTable 6.2 Characteristics of some fused salt electro lytic cells for preparation of misch metal (Hirschhorn 1967) Treibacher cell Prometheus cell Electrolyte RECl3–NaCl RECl3–CaCl2 Anode Carbon Graphite Cathode Iron Iron Bath temperature, °C 850 850 Cell atmosphere Cell gases + air Cell gases + airAverage DC current, A 2300 1500 Average DC voltage, V 14 12 DC power consumption, kWh/kg 15.6 13.6Current efficiency, % 45 50 RECl 3/Metal ratio 2.3 2.8 Capacity, kg metal/hr 1.86 1.3206 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 362 a cooled cathode. In the latter case, the solidifi ed metal was melted again by internal resist- ance heating, supplemented, if needed, by an ex ternal source of heat before it was removed from the cell. These were many ways by wh ich the misch metal was recovered from the cell. One procedure was to scoop the liquid me tal with a ladle. The other procedure was to pour the entire contents of the cell, electroly te bath included, into molds in which it was kept molten. After the misch metal had settle d to the bottom of the mold, the liquid bath was returned to the electrowinning cell and th e electrolysis was started again. The analysis of misch metal commercially produced by chlo ride electrolysis is given in Table 6.3. Commercial production of misch metal has been carried out primarily by chloride electrolysis, however, in the U.S. and Japa n, the procedure followed (Thomas 1977, Kudo 1988) used oxide as the feed to the electroly tic cell and a mixed fluoride electrolyte was oooooo Figure 6.3 Electrolytic cell with provision for tapping metal product (Shedd et al. 1970). 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 363 used. This procedure was essentially develope d by the U.S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) at the Reno Metallurgy Research Center. The USBM process of electrowinning misch metal directly from mixed rare earth oxides dissolved in a fluoride electrolyte was adopted by the Rare Earth Metal Corp. of America, a joint ve nture of Alcoa and Molycorp in the U.S. and by Santoku Metal Industry Co. in Japan. As early as 1977, the Rare Earth Metal Corp. successfully completed operation of a pilot el ectrolytic cell using mi xed rare earth oxide and began construction of a 20,000 amp cell fo r a production rate of about 100,000 kgs of misch metal per year. Santoku switched over from chloride electrolysis to the USBM process and operates several 20,000 amp cells for misch metal production (Thomas 1977). 6.2.3 Electrolysis of Oxide –Fluoride Melts The electrolysis of a mixed rare earth oxide feed obtained by processing of bastnasite concentrate in a REF3–LiF–BaF2 electrolyte was investigated at the Reno center of the U.S. Bureau of Mines for preparing misch me tal (Shedd et al. 1970). The process was carried out in a 300 mm diamet er cell for continuous electro lysis, shown in Figure 6.3. The cell had a 300 mm inside diameter with a 50 mm diameter molybdenum cathode surrounded by eight 50 mm diameter graphite rod anodes. The spacing between the cathode and anode was 65 mm. The feed material was added to the cell through a 25 mm diameter tube positioned between two anodes. A mo lybdenum crucible was placed below the cathode to collect the misch metal product. A molybdenum pipe attached to the molyb- denum collecting crucible extended out of th e cell 760 mm into a casting chamber where a mold was kept to collect the molten misch metal. The cell was internally heated. Initial meltin g of the bath and heating to electrolysis temperature were done by applying alternating cu rrent (AC) to a graphite resistor positioned oo Table 6.3 Analysis of commercially pro duced misch metal (Hirschhorn 1967) Element Content in MM, % Ce 53 La 23 Nd 16 Pr 5 Dy Trace Gd 2Y Trace Other RE Not detected Cr 0.034Fe 0.035 Mg 0.032 Mn 0.006Si 0.010 C 0.008 O 0.002N 0.00306 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 364 between the cathode and the two anodes. Once the electrolyte reached the temperature of 950°C, the resistor was removed and the direct current (DC) used for electrolysis provided sufficient heat to maintain the cell at 950°C. The cell was insulated by refractory bricks and was located in a gas-tight steel chamber, 1220 mm in diameter and 1220 mm long. The chamber was equipped with a glove and view and access ports. It was evacuated and back filled with helium four times before start of each operation. The feed material for electrolysis was de rived from bastnasite. It was prepared as follows. The bastnasite concentrate was leach ed with dilute hydrochloric acid to remove CaCO3 and SrCO3. The leach residue was roasted with Na2CO3 at 700°C to convert the barite impurity to BaCO3 and to decompose the carbonate. The material was then leached in water to remove Na2SO4 and dried at 400°C. The bastnas ite concentrate thus treated was a mixture of oxides with a small amount of fl uorides. The analysis is given in Table 6.4. The electrolyte was composed of REF3, LiF (99.6% pure), and BaF2 (98.2% pure). The mixed rare earth fluoride was prepared from the treated bastnasite concentrate by hydrofluorination. The oxygen content of th e fluoride was 0.64% and the sulfur content was 0.04%. All the electrolyte components were dried at 300°C for 24 h before use. Based on preliminary experiments with a 75 mm diameter experimental cell, Shedd et al. (1970) chose an electrolyte containing 50% REF3, 20% BaF2, and 30% LiF. Forty-five kgs of electrolyte were used. The cell operating da ta are listed in Table 6.5. The cell was maintained at the operating temperature thro ughout the duration of electrolysis during which many electrodepositions were carried out. At times when electrolysis was not conducted, the electrolyte was kept molt en by passing AC through the electrodes. After electrolysis, the metal product was ta pped. To tap the metal, the cathode was raised out of the electrolyte and an AC of 15 00 amperes at 9 volts was passed between the anode and the molybdenum tapping pipe. Metal flowing from the pipe was collected in theTable 6.4 Analysis of treated bastnasite concentrate (Shedd et al. 1970) Element Content, % Ba 4.7 Ca 0.3 C 0.6Ce 42.3 Eu Not detected F 2.0Gd 0.01 Fe 0.7 La 23.9Nd 9.8 Pr 3.2 Sm 0.6Si 1.0 S 0.07 Th Not detected Y 0.206 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 365 iron mold in the casting chamber. Tapping lasted until all the metal had drained and electrolyte began to flow thro ugh the pipe. The AC was then turned off and the electrolyte was allowed to freeze in the tapping pipe. The an alysis of the tapped metal is also given in Table 6.5. Shedd et al. (1970) noted that several electrodepositions could be conducted in the electrolyte, and the electrolyte system would sustain prolonged use if periodic additions of salts were made to readjust the electrolyte composition. Even though misch metal is commercially pr epared by the fused salt electrolysis methods described above, and the product is su itable for most of its applications such as alloying additive for ductile iron and steels and as a lighter flint, there are a number of applications where misch metal can be potential ly useful as a replacement for the relatively more expensive individual rare earth metals , and a purer misch metal is desirable. A method based on metallothermic reduction of the fluoride has been described by Palmer et al. (1982) of the Ames group for preparation of pure misch metal. 6.2.4 Ames Process The flowsheet for the production of pure misch metal starting from mixed rare earth carbonate obtained from bastnasite or monazite processing (Palmer et al. 1982) is shown in Figure 6.4.

The purity in the product was achieved by using purified start materials. As-received mixed rare ear th carbonates from bastnasite and monazite origin were first purified by dissolution in HCl and precipitation of the rare earths as oxalate. The oxalate was calcined to the oxid e in fused silica trays. This treatment brought down the levels of almost all the impurities originally present in the rare earth carbonate and resulted in pure mixed rare earth ox ide. The values are given in Table 6.6. Oxalate precipitation is a well-known analyt ical procedure to recover pure rare earths from solution. Along with thorium and the alka line earths, calcium, strontium, and barium, the rare earths also form the most insoluble oxa lates. Oxalates of most of the non-rare-earth metals are not precipitated from dilute acid so lutions. As a result, oxalate precipitation, using oxalic acid, leads to complete partitio n between the rare earths on the one hand and silicon, manganese, iron, copper, an d zinc on the other (Palmer et al. 1982). Use of a strong- ly acidic media will result in some calcium, strontium, barium, thorium, and uranium being left behind in the aqueous phase.

The oxide loaded in a platinum tray was heated to 650°C under a fl ow of 8 lph anhydrous HF and 20 lph argon for 24 h. The fluorides were then reduced with high purity calcium in tantalum crucibles as described in Chapter 4 for metal prep aration. From the reduced mass, CaF2 slag was removed and the misch metal was vacuum melted at 1000°C. The misch metal thusobtained contained H 1 ppm, C < 10 ppm, N < 6 ppm, and O ≤ 30 ppm. The residual fluorine content varied from ~60 to ~250 ppm. Vacuum melting at 1700°C, instead of 1000°C, brought down the residual fluo rine content drastically to ~10 ppm. As regards the composition of the misch meta l with respect to constituent rare earths, Palmer et al. (1982) anticipated and also observed certain composition changes between the mixed rare earth oxide/fluoride, as-reduced metal and the vacuum cast metal. In the reduction step, the samarium trifluoride SmF 3 will at best reduce to SmF2, and this very stable difluoride will remain with CaF2 slag. Samarium metal is thus lost as it does not end up in the misch metal. Even in the electrolytic production of misch metal, samarium contentin the mixed rare earth chloride feed was foun d to concentrate in the slag, and this slag, incidentally, was one of the prime sources of samarium for use in SmCo 5 permanent magnets. Another significant composition cha nge, regarding the pro portion of the various rare earth metals in misch metal, occurs during vacuum melting. Vacuum melting at 1700°C leads to the loss of a quarter to half of the neodymium contained in the as-reduced or 1000°C vacuum cast metal. The analysis of misch metals prepared at Ames andcommercially available from Ronson metal ar e listed in Table 6.7 (Palmer et al. 1982). The Ames experiment of thermal reduction as a method for preparation of misch metal is the second highly refined attempt at the pr ocess. The first attempt was made by Decroly et al. (1953) in Brussels, Belgium in 19 52, using a thermit type reaction. 6.2.5 Thermal Reduction ProcessStarting from mixed rare earth oxides prepar ed by processing of bastnasite and monazite ores from the Belgian Congo, Decroly et al. (1953) at the University of Brussels prepared mixed rare earth fluoride and reduced it by calcium to misch metal. The mixed oxide was converted to the fluo ride by using ammonium bifluoride. The reaction was carried out in the apparatus shown in Figure 6.5. An intimate mixture of rare earth oxide and excess ammonium bifluoride wa s loaded in the crucible made of aluminum but lined on the inside with slightly sintered CaF The crucible was placed in an electric furnace and a copper or aluminum collector was put over the crucible to recover the gases that evolved in the reaction. The collector was connected with a silica tube where some volatilized ammonium bifluoride could be condensed and recovered. The charge was heated at 150°C for several hours and a so lid double fluoride product was obtained. RE2O3 + 4NH4HF → 2REF3.NH4F + 2NH3 + 3H2O In the second step, the double fluoride was decomposed by heating to 400°C. REF3.NH4F → REF3 + NH4F The decomposition was carried out in the appara tus shown in Figure 6.6. A silica tube placed in an electric furnace was the decomposition ve ssel. This vessel was connected to another06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 368 Table 6.7 Composition (at %) of various misch metals Source Vacuum casting temperature, °CLa Ce Pr Nd Sm Gd Y Fe Mg Si C N O F Monazite 1000 20.1 49.7 6.4 20.4 <0.5 1.8 1.6 0.009 <0.0001 <0.0001 7 4 21 86 Monazite 1700 22.5 52.2 6.2 15.5 <0.5 2.0 1.6 0.008 <0.0001 <0.0001 7 6 22 8 Bastnasite 1000 39.8 37.5 6.2 16.5 <0.5 <0.2 <0.05 0.006 <0.0001 <0.0001 23 1 15 132 Bastnasite 1700 42.1 40.8 6.5 10.6 <0.5 <0.2 <0.05 0.006 <0.0001 <0.0001 <2 3 29 13 Ronson as-received 23.6 54.4 5.4 12.1 0.5 0.4 0.1 4.3 2.8 0.2 Ronson 1700 24.4 53.3 5.3 11.9 0.5 0.4 0.1 2.6 0.01 0.2 13 55 740 2006 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 369 silica tube by a rubber connectio n. The second tube was cool ed by a copper coil in which water was circulated. To sweep away the ammoni um fluoride vapors and to keep an inert atmosphere in the reactor, dry nitrogen was introduced into the decomposition vessel. Ammonium fluoride collected in the conde nsation tube and was easily recovered. The double fluoride was loaded in a calc ium fluoride-lined aluminum trough and the trough was placed in the decomposition vessel . Keeping a nitrogen flow, the temperature was raised to 400°C. The double fluoride decomposed. The decomposition of 1000 g of double fluoride took 10 to 12 h. The comp letion of the double fluor ide decomposition was checked by determining nitrogen content of the residue, and decomposition was considered complete when the nitrogen content was 10 ppm . Chemical analysis for fluorine confirmed the quantitative formation of rare earth trifluoride. Calcium was used as the reducing agent for the mixed rare earth trifluorides, but the heat available from the heat of reaction alone for 2REF3 + 3Ca → 2RE + 3CaF2 was not sufficient to heat and melt the reduced metals and slag in a typical thermit type reduction. The use of iodine as booster was necessary. Figure 6.5 Apparatus for the fluorination of mixed rare earth oxide (Decroly et al. 1953). Figure 6.6 Apparatus for the decomposition of ammonium rare earth double fluoride (Decroly et al. 1953).06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 370 The apparatus used by Decroly et al. (1953) to carry out the reduction of mixed rare earth fluoride with calcium is shown schematical ly in Figure 6.7. It comprised a steel pot with removable lid. To obtain air tightness when the lid was closed, a water-cooled circular rubber gasket was used. This gasket was placed in a circular trough welded at the top of the steel pot. The wall of the reaction chamber was made of packed CaF2 powder, and the cham- ber was conical in shape. At the bottom of this chamber was a cylindrical crucible of sintered CaF2. An electric heating coil provided in the pot was used for drying the lining and crucible. The use of pure calcium fluoride as refractory material eliminated the possibility of conta- mination of the produced metal except by el ements already present in the charge. The reaction mixture had 150 gms of mixed fl uorides, 70 gms of iodine, and an amount of calcium chips 15% in excess of the quantit y theoretically needed to reduce the fluorides and combine with iodine. After loading this mi xture, the reaction was started by a burning magnesium ribbon. The reaction proceeded very smoothly and lasted only a few seconds. When the reduction was through, the vessel was closed with the lid, which had a tube that allowed pumping off all the air present in th e reactor and replacing it with pure argon. The product was cooled under a positive pressure of argon. After cooling, the slag was easily separated and the metal collected in the lower cr ucible as a small ingot, which was recovered. The analysis of the misch metal obtained is given in Table 6.8. It was not quite pure but good enough for preparing pyrophoric alloy. Even in the small-scale experiments, the yield of misch metal was 78 to 80%. 6.3 RARE EARTH –SILICON –IRON ALLOYS Rare earths are added to steel mostly in the form of rare earth–silicon–iron alloy or as misch metal. The alloy is often preferred over misch metal because of its low cost. Figure 6.7 Apparatus for thermit type reduction of rare earth trifluoride by calcium (Decroly et al. 1953). 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 371 Commercially, the rare earth–silicon–iro n alloy is prepared by carbothermic reduction of a mixture of rare earth compound s, silica, and iron at above 1930°C (Staggers 1977). An alloy composed of approximately 1/ 3 misch metal, 1/3 silicon, and 1/3 iron was obtained in a submerged electric arc furnace by the direct reduction of bastnasite ore concentrate, iron ore, and quartz. In the commercial production process, the rare earth recovery is not more than 60%. Many other techniques have b een reported (Marchant et al. 1980) for the preparation of rare earth–silicon–iron alloys. They rely on the use of calcium–silicon (~30% Ca) alloy or calcium silicide as reducing agents for mi xed rare earth oxides prepared from monazite or bastnasite sources. Many variations of the reduction technique have been patented (Krismer and Smetana 1968, Hirschhorn and Klein 1969, Kallenbach and Bungardt 1969). In one, up to 50% of the calcium–silicon allo y was replaced by either calcium or silicon (Krismer and Smetana 1968). Calcium carbide wa s also used as a partial replacement of the calcium–silicon alloy (Kallenbach and Bungardt 1969). In yet another process, mixed rare earth oxides were reduced with calcium silicide at 1500°C, and iron scrap was added to the molten charge to get a product containing 30% RE, 29% Si, 40% Fe, and 1% Ca (Hirsch- horn and Klein 1969). The use of calcium sili cide, ferrosilicon, silicon, and aluminum as reductants for mixed rare earth oxides prepar ed from bastnasite flotation concentrate were investigated at the Reno Center of USBM to obtain rare earth–silicon–iron–aluminum alloys (Marchant et al. 1980). 6.3.1 Reno (USBM) Process The flowsheet of the process is shown schemati cally in Figure 6.8. The starting materials were mixed rare earth oxide, aluminum turn ings and ferrosilicon alloy. The mixed rare earth oxide was commercially available leached and calcined bastnasite concentrate. The total rare earth content of the concentrat e was 78.6 wt %, and this comprised the percentages 40.5 Ce, 25.1 La, 9.3 Nd, 3.25 Pr , and < 0.4 other RE. The ferrosilicon was also a commercially available product with a no minal composition of 25% Fe–75% Si. The reduction procedure involved blending the mixe d rare earth oxide with aluminum turnings and 6 mm fragments of ferrosilicon alloy and loading the mixture in a densified silicon carbide crucible. A flux of lime (CaO) and magnesia (MgO) was added on top of thereduction charge. The flux was necessary, because if it were absent a significant amount of rare earth–silicon–iron alloy became entrapped in a viscous slag. As a result, completeTable 6.8 Analysis of misch metal prepared by thermit reduction (Decroly et al. 1953) *47.9% Ce, 50.3% La, Nd etc.Element Content, % RE metals 98.2* Ca 0.32 Si 0.09 Fe 1.04 Cu 0.28 Not determined 0.0706 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 372 separation of slag from the alloy became diffi cult when attempts were made to pour the molten product. The reduction was carried out in an induction furnace. The charge and flux were melted and held at 1500°C for 30 min to complete the reaction. The melt was then poured into an iron mold. The rare earth–sil icon–iron alloy was recovered by allowing the melt to freeze and breaking the slag away. The product analysis is given in Table 6.9. The following reactions were also investigated by Marchant et al. (1980) for preparing rare earth–silicon, rare earth–silicon–aluminum and rare earth–silicon–aluminum–iron alloys. RE2O3 + 3CaSi2 → 2RESi2 + 2Si + 3CaO 2RE2O3 + 11Si → 4RESi2 + 3SiO2 The use of ferrosilicon in place of silicon resulted in iron reporting to the alloy product. The rare earth recovery was highest (98%) when 12 0% of the stoichiometric amount of calcium silicide was used. For an industrial operation, however, calcium silicide is not very suitable as a reductant because of its limited availabil ity and high cost. The rare earth recovery in the alloy was very low (~40%) when silicon or ferrosilicon was used even at 120% of the stoichiometric amount. The use of aluminum in addition to silicon or ferrosilicon improved the rare earth recovery to ~70%, howeve r ~600% of the stoichiometric amount of aluminum had to be used. 3RE2O3 + 15Si + 2Al → 6RESi2 + 3SiO2 + Al2O3 The resulting alloy contained ~18% alumin um. When silicon was used in the above reaction, the product was a rare earth–silicon –aluminum alloy, and a problem with the rare earth–silicon–aluminum alloy was that the al loy disintegrated into powder even after a short time exposure to air. On the othe r hand, when ferrosilicon was used in place of silicon the resulting rare earth–silicon–aluminum –iron alloys remained intact in air. The rare earth alloy in the disintegrated form wo uld be undesirable as a ladle addition because of a dusting problem. Figure 6.8 Schematic flowsheet for the preparation of rare earth–iron–silicon alloy. 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 373 The major advantages of the USBM process ar e the higher rare earth content in their alloy product (53% RE, 28% Si, 11% Fe, and 4% Al) and a higher (80%) rare earth recovery. This compares well with the comm ercial process figures of 30% rare earth in alloy and 60% rare earth recovery. Functionall y, the USBM alloys were as good as the commercial rare -earth–silicon–iron alloys (Marchant et al. 1980). 6.3.2 BARC Process The preparation of rare earth–silicon–iron a lloy by metallothermic reduction was also investigated at the Metallurgy Division of BARC (Bose et al. 1985). A mixed rare earth oxide (REO) concentrate of monazite origin, ob tained from Indian Rare Earths in Alwaye, was used as the source of rare earths. The RE2O3 content of the mixed oxide was 95% and the ratio of CeO2 to RE2O3 in the oxide was about 48%. Co mmercially available 80% grade ferrosilicon and aluminum rod scrap (>99% Al ) were used as reductants. Two types of fluxes were used. One was a CaO–MgO flux and the other was a CaO–CaF2 flux. The details of charge and products are listed in Table 6.10. The charge comprising mixed REO, 25 mm pieces of ferrosilicon, and aluminum was loaded in a 250 mm graphite crucible and covered on top with CaO–MgO flux mixture. ooooTable 6.9 Results for ferrosilicon–aluminum reduction of mixed rare earth oxide in an induction-heated reactor (Marchant et al. 1980) Charge weight, g 1170 Reactants: Mixed rare earth oxide, g 681 Fe–78 Si alloy, g 309Aluminum 182 Flux: CaO, g 681 MgO, g 45 Alloy product weight, g 812 Slag weight, g 1100 Analysis: Alloy Slag Components Content, wt % Recovery, % Component Content, wt % RE 52.6 80 RE 2O3 12.7 Si 27.6 93 SiO2 4.7 Fe 10.7 85 FeO 1.2 Al 3.8 16 Al2O3 28.9 Ca 5.0 CaO 49.3P 0.05 MgO 2.3S 0.003 P 0.15 O 0.28 S 0.2406 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 374 The reduction was carried out by heating the ch arge to 1550°C in an induction furnace and keeping it at that temperature for 30 min. Th e molten RE–Si–Fe alloy that was formed was tilt poured and cast in cast iron molds. When CaO–CaF2 flux was used, the procedure wa s different. Calcium fluoride was first melted in the crucible. Mixed rare earth oxide and then CaO were added to the melt to form a molten bath of REO–CaO–CaF2. Ferrosilicon and aluminum in lump form were added to the bath at 1500°C, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min. The alloy product was finally cast. The rare earths loading in the rare earth–sil icon–iron alloy and the recovery of rare earths in the alloy were similar in the expe riments conducted at USBM and at BARC. The mixed rare earth oxide derived from monazite was used at BARC and a bastnasite source material was reacted at USBM. The product ob tained at BARC was higher in Si content and relatively low in iron. BARC experiments pointed to CaO–CaF2 as the more favorable flux mixture in view of better slag fluidity, lower temperature of operation, and better rare earth recovery in the alloy. The REO losses into the slag phase were also limited to below 10%. 6.3.3 Baotou Process Caiquan et al. (1985) used the rare earth containing blast furnace slag, obtained on smelting of the Bayan Obo iron–rare earth ore at the Baotou blast furnaces, as the source of rare earths for reduction to the rare earth–silicon–i ron alloy. The composition of the slag and the alloy obtained from it ar e both given in Table 6.11. The alloy was obtained by reduction of th e blast furnace REO slag in an arc furnace using lime as flux and ferrosilicon as reduct ant. The recovery of REM was in the 60–70% range and many different grades of alloys , including 30% RE–Si–Fe alloy, could be prepared.Table 6.10 Metallothermic reduction of mixed REO (Bose et al. 1985) Charge Flux Product REO Fe–80Si Al CaO MgO CaF2RE–Si–Fe alloy recoveredREM Si Fe Al REM recovered, % 5000 2670 1336 5000 330 – 5610 54.2 33.2 5.5 4.0 76 4000 2600 1070 5050 – 7000 5000 55.0 33.0 5.0 4.0 82 Table 6.11 Composition of the Baotou slag and RE FeSi alloy obtained (Caiquan et al. 1985) Baotou slag Elements REO Fe P F CaO SiO2 MnO Alkalinity Content, % 10–16 ≤1≤0.1 10–16 38–42 20–24 ≤2 1.0 RE–Si–Fe alloyElements RE Si Mn Ca Ti FeContent, % 18–47 45–50 5–2 6–2 3–0.5 Balance06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 375 6.4 RARE EARTH–MAGNESIUM–SILICON ALLOYS The rare earth–Mg–Si alloys have been used as additives in the making of nodular iron. The conventional methods for production of th ese alloys have disadvantages such as con- sumption of large amounts of metallic magnes ium and the loss of magnesium due to vapori- zation. Shumao and Mingqin (1985) carried ou t direct preparation of rare earth–Mg–Si alloys by a silicothermic reduction process. The rare earths-bearing raw materials were from the Bayan Obo deposit. One of the two materials is the Baotou blast furnace slag containing >10% REO, and the other is the rare earth concentrate containing about 30 % REO. The other components of the charge were calcined dolomite containing 34% MgO and reducing agents such as ferrosilicon calcium and silicon. Reductions were carried out in an electric arc furnace. The optimum smelting conditions were smelting temperature >1550°C, CaO + MgO ≈ 35–45%, and silicon content of the reducing agent >85%. The composition of the alloy obtained was Mg 3–5%, (Ca + Mg) >10%, RE 6–17%, Si 50–55%, and the balance was Fe. Shumao and Mingqin (1985) noted that controlling th e voltage and current in the operation and timely tapping of the alloy were neces sary for the success of the process. 6.5 RARE EARTH–ALUMINUM–ZINC ALLOY A galvanizing zinc alloy containing 5% al uminum and small amounts of lanthanum and cerium has been considered to offer much bett er protection to underlying steel than does normal zinc cover (Radtke and Herrschaft 1983). Xujun et al. (1985) have investigated a molten salt electrolysis method as an alte rnative to conventional methods of melting together the components or thermal reduction of compound intermediates. The electrolyte consisted of 20–30% RECl3 in an equimolar mixture of KCl–NaCl, with CaF2 1%, NaF 1% as additives. A cylindrical graphite crucible, which was also the anode, was used to contain the molten salt. The cathode was molten Al–Zn alloy (Al:Zn = 60:40) contained in a porcelain crucible and placed in the cell. Electrolysis was conducted at 650–680°C and the bath was continuously stirred. Cathode current density was kept at 2–2.5 A/cm2. After electrolysis was completed, the cathode product was removed and cooled, and the electrolyte on th e alloy surface was washed away. Under the conditions mentioned, an a lloy containing 8% RE was obtained. The current efficiency was as high as 81% and the rare earth recovery was quantitative. In their experiments Xujun et al. (1985) produced up to 375 g of the alloy per batch. 6.6 YTTRIUM–ALUMINUM ALLOY Both yttrium and aluminum are constituents in several oxidation resistant alloys useful for high temperature service. Yttrium–aluminum ma ster alloy is convenient for introducing the constituent elements in the high temperatur e alloys. Methods mainly based on fused salt electrolysis have been developed for the pro duction of these alloys (Morrice et al. 1973). In one method (Bratland et al. 1972), yttrium–aluminum alloys were made by electro- lysis of yttrium oxide in yttrium fluoride–lit hium fluoride melts using floating cathodes of06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 376 liquid aluminum In this arrangement, the maximum concentration of yttrium recovered in the alloy was only 22%. Yttrium–aluminum alloys of higher yttrium content were prepared at Reno by electro- lyzing mixtures of yttrium oxide and aluminum oxide dissolved in yttrium fluoride–lithium fluoride melts and codepositing the metals to form liquid alloys. The 120 mm diameter cell used at Reno fo r electrowinning Y–Al alloy using a liquid Y–Al alloy cathode is shown in Figure 6.9 (Mo rrice et al. 1973). The anode as well the crucible used to contain the molten electroly te were made of graphite. The cell was placed inside a shell of mullite bricks to provide th ermal insulation. To furnish heat to melt the electrolyte and to maintain the desired operat ing temperature, a graphite resistance heater was located below the graphite crucible. To protect cell components, the alloy product, and the graphite resistor from air oxidation at th e operating temperature, the entire assembly was placed inside a chamber under helium. As usual, glove ports and view ports were pro- vided in the chamber to facilitate the cell operation. Yttrium fluoride was prepared by fluorinating 99.9% pure Y2O3 powder with ammo- nium bifluoride (Carlson and Schmidt 1961). The rare earth fluoride contained 0.1 to 0.2% residual oxygen. Lithium fluoride, yttrium ox ide, aluminum oxide, yttrium metal, and aluminum metal used by Morrice et al. (1973) were all 99.9% pure. The starting alloy pool was a 91% Y–9% Al liquid alloy (at the operating tempera- ture), and it covered the bottom of the grap hite crucible. This alloy was obtained by arc melting the alloy components together. This liquid alloy pool was the cathode. The anode, a 75 mm diameter 12 mm thick horizontal gra phite disk, was immersed into the electrolyte, and it was 12 to 19 mm above the alloy po ol surface. The electrolyte was prepared by mechanically mixing the required amounts of yttrium fluoride and lithium fluoride to obtain the composition 80% YF3–20% LiF. The electrolyte temperature was 1025°C. An oxide mixture comprising 87% Y2O3–13% Al2O3 (this mixture has the same Y/Al ratio as that of the eutectic alloy) was fed to the cel l and electrolysis was conducted at 4 volts and 70 to 80 amperes for 3 h. Yttria and alumina were electrolytically reduced, and the resulting metals formed alloy in the alloy pool, which increased in quantity without major change in composition, as the electrolysis progressed. The composition of the alloy formed needed to be closely controlled because if the aluminum content of the cathode pool increase d, it would tend to float and interfere in Figure 6.9 Electrolytic cell for production of Y–Al alloy at a Y–Al liquid cathode (Morrice et al. 1973). 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 377 electrolysis. On the other hand, if the yttriu m content in the cathode pool increased, the melting point of the alloy pool woul d rise and the pool would solidify. The operation of the liquid cathode has been in vestigated for 12 to 15 h (Morrice et al. 1973). The current efficiency and Y–Al alloy recovery were maximum at 68 and 89%, re- spectively, when 85% Y2O3–15% Al2O3 oxide mixture was fed to the cell. The electrowon alloy was approximately of eutectic composition (91% Y). 6.7 PERMANENT MAGNET MATERIALS There are numerous permanent magnet materi als and those that have been commercially important are listed in Table 6.12 (Strnat 198 5). Permanent magnets are rated on the basis of several key properties. The foremost among these properties are the energy product and coercivity. The attractive characteristics of good permanent magnet materials are high coercivity (resistance to demagnetization) an d high energy product. The energy product (BH)max is a measure of the useful strength of a permanent magnet and is the most often quoted figure of merit for comparing perman ent magnets. The progression of the maximum energy product in various permanent magnet ma terials during this century (Strnat 1985) is shown in Figure 6.10. The figure illustrates the 100-fold increase of the magnetic energy that can be stored in a volume unit and the en hancement of the coercivity by an even larger factor. Many of these enhancements began in the late 1960s with the discovery and devel- opment of rare earth based permanent magnet materials. These materials are based on either the rare earth–cobalt system or the neodymium–iron–boron system.

The first gr oup of rare earth magnets developed in the 1960s and commercially produced in the 1970s were based on the intermetallic compounds RECo5 and RE2Co17. These intermetallic compounds possess the ideal combination of magnetic and structural properties for magnet applications. The first and most widely used magnet of this type was SmCo5. The structure of SmCo5 is hexagonal (CaCu5 structure), its saturation induction is moderate, and it ha s extremely large positive values of magneto- crystalline anisotropy. The magnets based on SmCo5 are single phase and magnetic property values achieved in the laboratory are Br = 1 T, Hcj = 3200 kA/m, and (BH)max = 200 kJ/m3. The (BH)max in commercial SmCo5 magnets are in the range 130–160 kJ/m3. In other words, SmCo5 magnets offer energy per unit vo lume 2 to 3 times more than that of the old generation magnets such as PtCo and AlNiCo and also exhibit 5 to 20 times greater resistance to demagnetization. In single phase SmCo5 magnets the mechanism of coercivity is based on nucleation and/or pi nning of domain walls at surfaces or grain boundaries. To achieve large values of coerciv ities it is necessary to have particle form (1–10 µm) or fine grained sintered magnets prepared from such powders. Magnet production techniques are, therefore, based on powder metallurgical procedures and include field pressing, i.e., alignment in a magn etic field during the pressing operation as a key process. Less expensive alternatives to SmCo5 have also been widely investigated (Wernick 1995). These include the use of Pr, Ce, and Ce–MM in combination with samarium. (Pr, Sm)Co5 have higher values of saturation induction than SmCo5. The Sm–Ce and Sm–MM combinations are cheaper, but the magnetic properties are also lower. The addition of copper to certain RECo5 alloy (partial substitution of Cu for Co) and proper heat treatment can result in a fine ly distributed two ph ase structure and high coercive force, even in bulk (Nesbitt and Wernick 1973). Low copper Sm or SmCo5 based alloys are magnetically hardened by a Cu rich 1–5 phase precipitated within the grain. The precipitate impedes domain wall motion and gives mHc in the range 400–560 kA/m. Copper additions strongly broaden the high temperature homogeneity range of the 1–5phase toward 2–17 and permit incorporation of iron into the lattice. It has therefore been possible to prepare precipitation hardened magnet alloys (Sm, Ce) (Co, Cu, Fe) z up to z = 6.8 and (Sm, Y) (Co, Cu, Fe)z up to z = 7.2 with excellent properties. These may be considered as 1–7 alloys. The magnetic data for selected magnets are listed in Table 6.13. The RE2TM17 compositions have basic properties that could lead to magnets of energy products of 480 kJ/m3 or more. Sm2Co17 (SmCo8.5) has the highest anisotropy and best potential. Commercial magnets based on SmCo8.5 contain, in addition to Co, the metals Cu, Fe, and Zr to replace some of the Co. The preparation of sintered magnets veryclose to the 2–17 stoichiometry, having en ergy products exceeding the highest for the 1–5 composition; have been reported (Strnat 1978). For example, Sm 2(Co,Fe,Mn,Cr)17 and Sm2(Co,Fe,Cu,Nb)17 have an energy product of 225 kJ/m3 while, Sm2(Co,Fe,Cu, Zr)17 have energy products of 240 kJ/m3 each. The attractive hard magnetic properties of these materials arise from microstructural precipitates that pin domain walls. 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 380 6.8.1 Preparation The preparation of RE–Co magnets involves tw o major stages. The first is the preparation of the RECo alloy and the next is the produ ction of the magnets from the alloy. The RECo alloy has been prepared by many routes. They are (i) direct melting of the alloy com- ponents, (ii) co-reduction or reduction diffusi on using the metal oxides as start materials, and finally (iii) the direct production of the a lloy by fused salt electrolysis using cobalt as the consumable anode. Direct Melting Rare earth–cobalt alloys for magn et production can be prepared by melting together the alloy components. The meltin g can be carried out either in cold crucible by means of high frequency induction heating or in crucibles such as boron nitride and alumina (Kirchmayr and Poldy 1979). The latter , however, is slowly attacked by the melt. A survey of the various techniques for prep aring RE–Co alloys has been given by Herget and Domazer (1975). For melting a mixture of samarium or other rare earth and cobalt, either small ready-made crucibles or crucibles that are rammed and fired in situ using an inner graphite core have been used. Vacuum induction melting is a particularly clean method for preparing these alloys. If small quanti ties of alloys are to be prepared, the com- ponents can be melted in an arc furnace. Walkiewicz et al. (1973) prepared Sm–Co com- pounds by nonconsumable arc melting of 99.9 % pure metals. About 80-g charges of these metals were melted under helium. To achieve homogeneity, the arc melted buttons were inverted and remelted a total of five times. An excess of samarium was provided in the charge to compensate for samarium loss due to vaporization. To obtain the stoichiometric SmCo5 composition of 33.8% samarium, a charge composition of 37% samarium and 63% cobalt was used. A blending method was also us ed as an alternative to the above approach, which essentially involved obtaining a partic ular alloy composition by adding controlled amounts of Sm and Co to the charge before melting. In this method, two separate com- pounds, near stoichiometric SmCo5 and Sm2Co17, were first prepared. These compounds were then blended in the required ratio an d melted to obtain the optimum composition of 36.7±0.3% samarium. Walkiewicz et al. (1973) found the blending method to be superiorTable 6.13 Magnetic data of selected 1–7 or 2–17 alloys (Strnat 1978) α is the approximate value of the temperature coefficient of remanence per 1°C.

At the beginning of the 1970s when alloys of the type RECo5, particularly SmCo5, assumed great importance as new permanent ma gnet materials of extraordinary perform- ance, development of new economic methods of alloy preparation began apart from the route of melting samarium metal with cobalt in vacuum induction furnaces. It was discover- ed that calciothermic reduction of Sm2O3 in the presence of cobalt powder, and eventually of additional alloy components, yielded the re quired alloy directly in the powder form. There are two variants of this method and they are known as reduction diffusion and co-reduction. Reduction Diffusion Process The process was invented in 1969 by Cech (1974) working at the General Electric Corporate R& D Center in Schenectady, New York. The flowsheet of the process is given in Figure 6.11. Cobalt powder, rare earth oxide, and calci- um hydride were used as the starting material s. They were first pretreated. The pretreatment sequence consisted of removal of residual oxygen from the cobalt powder, removal of moisture from the rare earth oxide, and conversi on of metallic calcium to the hydride form. As an alternative, Cech (1974) suggested th at cobalt oxide and RE oxide could be mixed first and then the dispersed cobalt oxide could be reduced to the metallic state with hydro- gen. The pretreated starting materials were th en intimately mixed under an inert atmosphere and subjected to a programmed thermal treat ment in a hydrogen atmosphere furnace. The reacted mixture, which was in the form of a solid cake, was aged in wet nitrogen. This treatment permitted excess calcium disperse d in the product to re act with moisture and led to the spontaneous disintegration of the product cake into powder. The powder was treated with a dilute mineral acid to leach out calcium oxide. The powder was then rinsed, dried, and subjected to additional grinding to re fine the particle size to that needed for the fabrication of magnets. Figure 6.11 Schematic of the reduction diffusion process. 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 382 In his experiments, Cech (1974) prepared the cobalt powder by hydrogen reduction of the cobalt oxide after it was first dispersed in the rare earth oxide. He also prepared calcium hydrate “in-house” from commercial grade calci um nodules. He dispersed calcium nodules in the cobalt metal–rare earth oxide mixture before converting them to hydride. Hydriding of calcium required only a brief furnacing treatment. The mixture was then homogenized by passing through a double disk pulverizer an d then repacked in a covered iron boat for the chemical reduction treatment. The chemical reduction treatment consisted of heating the charge at 850°C for 2 h followed by three 30-min holding periods at 900, 950, and 1000 °C and finally a 2-h holding at 1050°C. The charge was then drawn into a water-cooled chamber to facilitate rapid cooling. Slow cooling, in a hydrogen atmosp here, it was observed, led to the formation of Sm5CoO type material by the reversal of the second reaction given below. Cech (1974) suggested that the following reactions closely describe the reduction diffusion process for RECo5 alloy formation. 10Co + RE2O3 + CaH2 → 2RECo5O + CaO + H2 (850°C) 2RECo5O + 2CaH2 → 2RECo5 + 2CaO + 2H2 (1050°C) According to Cech (1974), carrying out the reduction step directly at 1050°C led to undesirable complications arising out of form ation of low-melting rare earth-rich inter- metallic phases. The reduction should occur at su ch a rate that the rare earth formed should at the same time be removed by solid state diffusion into cobalt. Figure 6.12 Original (a) and modified (b) reduc tion diffusion processes (McFarland 1973). 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 383 The maximum overall yield of rare earth in the alloy obtained by Cech (1974) was 97+% using the following stoichiometry. 10Co + Sm2O3 + 12(3CaH2) → 2SmCo5 + 3CaO + 0.6CaH2 The yield decreased both at lowe r and higher proportions of CaH2. The batch size of the experiments were 2.7 kg of SmCo5. In addition to SmCo5, other alloys containing 75% Pr and 25% Sm in the rare earth part of the alloy have been prepared by the reduction diffusion. This fine powder alloy was processed to magnets that were as good as or superior to thos e made from conventional melt cast powder. The original reduction diffusion developed by Cech (1974) at General Electric was modified by McFarland (1973) from the sa me laboratory, and the schematics of both processes are shown in Figure 6.12. Cech (1974) was attempting to generate a powder in the 5 µ to 10 µ size range to avoid an expensive fluid energy mill ing step. The work on magnet fabrication by Cech as well as by Benz and Martin (1970) had indicated th at superior magnets could be made with powders of 6 µ to 8 µ size and this size was not achieve d without milling. McFarland (1973) therefore decided to do away with particle si ze controlling steps in the Cech process and to mill the final powder to the desired size. This led to process simplification by eliminating the initial wet ball milling step, the subsequent drying step, and a final screening step for removing oversize particles. In addition, cobalt oxide (Co3O4), which was chosen by Cech (1974) as the source of cobalt and also to provide many nuclei for the formation of fine particle Co–RE alloy, was replaced by comm ercially available cobalt metal powder. Commercially available CaH2 was used instead of generating it in situ . These changes eliminated the four steps following the first drier, namely the steps that required careful handling of freshly reduced, pyrophoric coba lt, and a complicated heating, cooling, and grinding schedule to generate and blend in the CaH2. Thus all the early steps are telescoped into one step in McFarland’s modification. The modified process, which was also scaled up, was carried out as follows. The starting materials were weighed and load ed into a blender. Cobalt and rare earth oxides, in stoichiometric quantities, were mixed first and then the calcium or calcium hydride up to 1.5 times the theoretically required quantity was added. The blending continued until a uniform mixture was obtaine d. The mixture was loaded into boats with loose fitting covers. A glove box flushed with nitrogen gas was routinely used for the CaH2 addition and boat filling operations. The loaded boats were introduced into an electrically heated retort with a hydrogen atmosphere. The retort was initially heated at 850°C for 2 to 3 h and the temperature was then raised to 1150°C and maintained for 2 to 3 h before the boats were moved to the cooling zone, still under hydrogen atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the me dium-hard lumpy product material in the boat was transferred to a glove bag containi ng a moist hydrogen atmosphere. The material decrepitated, following the exothermic reactions, CaH2 + H2O → CaO + 2H2 CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)206 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 384 to a fine powder. Depending primarily on the excess CaH2 present, this hydration treatment required 1 to 5 days. The bulk of the slaked lime was remove d from the hydrated material by purely mechanical means. The hydrated powder was slurried in water, the alloy was allowed to settle, and suspended lime was removed by decanting. An AC magnetic field was found to be useful to agitate the magnetic powder but to hold it in the bottom of the container for easy separation. Finally, the powder was rins ed with water and then with alcohol and transferred to a vacuum filter. The moist powd er with about 3 to 5% alcohol was placed in trays in a vacuum oven drier and dried overni ght at 50°C. The dry powder was stored in a sealed container preparatory to magnet ma nufacture. Following the above procedure, McFarland (1973) produced several compositions — from near stoichiometric SmCo5 to (Sm0.5Pr0.5)Co5 and (Sm0.6MM0.25Pr0.15)Co5. Jones et al. (1976) have described a scaled-up reduction diffusion process for the production of RECo5 and RE2Co7, followed at Hitachi Magnetics Corporation MI, since The general reaction of the reduction diffusion process xCo + RE2O3 + Ca → CoxRy + CaO was adopted for the production of the st oichiometric samarium compounds SmCo5 and Sm2Co7 as per the reactions 5Co + Sm2O3 + Ca → SmCo5 + CaO 7Co + Sm2O3 + 3Ca → Sm2Co5 + 3CaO An excess of calcium, about 1.2 to 1.4 ti mes the theoretically needed amount, was used in carrying out th e reactions in practice. Calculated quantities of cobalt powder, samarium oxide, and calcium granules (the raw materials) were mechanically mixed to form a uniform charge. The charge was heated in dry hydrogen at 1160°C for 4 h to co mplete the calcium reduction and rare earth diffusion. The reacted mass, which consis ted of the Sm–Co alloy, CaO, and CaH2 was placed in a high humidity environment to slack the lime and decompose the CaH2. The resulting Ca(OH)2 was separated by magnetic and gr avimetric means. The alloy powder was washed with dilute acetic acid to rem ove remaining traces of hydroxide, vacuum filtered, and dried. It was then sealed in metal cans and stored. Two compositions for the final alloy were selected for production. One was the stoichiometric alloy with 33.8% Sm. This was the base alloy powder. The other was an alloy with 42.2% Sm. This was used as the additive. The base alloy powder and additive were used for magnet fabrication. The additive powder being richer in rare earth content, a blend of the two resulted in an overall co mposition hyperstoichiometric to the RECo5 after correction for the oxygen content (as RE2O3). The particle size and particle size distri- bution of these alloy powders depe nd upon the cobalt powder used. Magnets made entirely from reduction diffu sion powder display permanent magnetic properties, which are equivalent to those of magnets made from ingot material. In either case, the properties attained were strongly de pendent upon the unit processes used to makey 2---3y 2------3y 2------ 1 2---3 2---3 2---06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 385 the magnets. In this context excellent reprod ucibility was possible for the products from reduction diffusion powders. Jones et al. (1976) refer to the impact of the reduction diffusion process on the cost of producing the rare earth cobalt magnet alloys. Even though calcium me tal used as reductant in the process is expensive, it is at least cheap er by a factor of two than the alternative misch metal used to produce the samarium metal. Be sides, a costly controlled atmosphere melting step was also eliminated. Overall, the raw ma terial and process cost reductions associated with the reduction diffusion process resulted in an eight-fold reduction in the published price of Sm–Co magnet alloys between 1971 and 1976. Co-reduction The co-reduction process develope d at Th. Goldschmidt AG (Domazer 1976, Herget 1982) also leads to the direct preparation of samarium–cobalt alloy from the metal oxides. Calcium was used as the reductant, a part of the cobalt in the final alloy was derived from cobalt oxide used to function as thermal booster in the reaction mixture, and the process was carried out in a vacuum at 1100–1200°C according to the overall reaction Sm2O3 + Co3O4 + 7Co + 7Ca 2SmCo5 + 7CaO The schematic flowsheet of the process is sh own in Figure 6.13. A palletized mixture of Sm2O3, Co3O4, Co, and Ca in stoichiometric qua ntity was heated at 1100–1200°C. Co-reduction, like reduction diffusion, occurre d rather quickly after initiation at high temperatures. However, it was necessary to keep the charge at the temperature indicated for about 2 to 4 h to permit full alloy formation be tween just formed but still partly isolated Sm and Co particles. Solid CaO product particle s form very early in the reaction, and by remaining interspersed between the metal part icles they slowed down alloy formation by diffusion. The high melting point of CaO pr ecluded the formation of a molten slag and Figure 6.13 Schematic flowsheet of the co-reduction process (Strnat 1988). 1100–1200°C vacuum 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 386 hence metal–slag separation. As the result, the alloy came out as a powder and not as an ingot. This was desirable because all the ra re earth–transition metal alloys were being processed into magnets by powder metallurgical methods, and even if an ingot were first produced it would have to be pulveri zed to obtain the alloy as powder. As metal did not coalesce and thus did not collect separate ly from the slag during the above process, a separation step for powder product collection was necessary. This was carried out by first reacting the CaO and exces s calcium metal with moist nitrogen, mecha- nically removing most of the Ca(OH)2, and leaching the remainder away with a mild acid (acetic acid). Electrolysis Apart from the reduction diffusion and co-reduction methods described, electrolytic methods have been investigated at the U.S. Bureau of Mines, Reno Center (Morrice et al. 1969), for the preparation of rare earth cobalt alloys for magnet use. Morrice et al. (1969) have described the following proces s for preparing high purity cobalt alloys containing individually samarium, yttriu m, praseodymium, cerium, lanthanum, gado- linium, dysprosium, neodymium, didymium mixture, mixed yttrium group metals, and mixed cerium group metals. Because the relative ly high prices of high purity rare earth metals are an important factor for producing rare earth–cobalt magnet materials, the Figure 6.14 Electrolysis cell for RE–Co alloy prep aration-I (six inch diameter cell) (Morrice et al. 1969). 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 387 electrolytic process uses oxides, a relatively ch eap source of high purity rare earth metals, as feed materials. Two internally heated thermal gradient cel ls were used for electrolysis. They are shown in Figures 6.14 and 6.15 . The cells were enclosed in inert gas chambers to prevent atmospheric contamination. In both the cells the electrolyte was contained in a graphite crucible, and the crucible was placed inside a shell fabricated from insulating bricks to enable it to maintain the requisite heat balance. The cathode in each cell was a 6 mm diameter cobalt rod. The first cell, shown in Figure 6.14, used a 150 mm diameter and 175 mm deep graphite crucible. The anode was a fluted 38 mm diameter graphite rod. For supplementary heating, AC was applied between two 32 mm diameter graphite rods. Approximately 9 kg of electrolyte was used in the cell. The cell wa s used to prepare cobalt alloys of cerium, praseodymium, lanthanum, neodymium, didymium mixture, and the mixed cerium groupmetals. The second cell, shown in Figure 6.15 , used a 100 mm diameter and 125 mm deep graphite crucible. For supplementary heating, alternating current was applied between two 19 mm diameter fluted graphite rods. These flut ed graphite rods were also connected to a direct current source and functioned as anod es during electrolysis. Generally 4 kg of electrolyte was contained in the cell. This cell was used to prepare cobalt alloys of samarium, yttrium, gadolinium, dysprosium, and mixed yttrium group metals. Figure 6.15 Electrolysis cell for RE–Co alloy preparation-II (four inch diameter cell) (Morrice et al. 1969). 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 388 The electrolytes used comprised LiF and the respective rare earth fluoride. The electrolyte used for cobalt didymium alloy preparation contained BaF2 as an additional component. This was necessary for increasing th e resistance of the electrolyte so that the desired electrolyte temperature could be maintained. For the preparation of mixed rare earth–cobalt alloys, the proportion of individu al rare earth fluorides in the electrolytes corresponded approximately to the proportions in the respective mixed oxides used as cell feed. Before commencing electrolysis, the iner t atmosphere chamber was evacuated and backfilled with helium. The required electroly te temperature was attained by applying AC to the heater rods and heating. Once the bath reaches the required electrolysis temperature, electrolysis was started and the rare earth oxide was intermittently fed to the cell at a rate determined by the rate of rare earth metal pr oduction. At the cathode zone, the temperature was maintained at above the melting temperatur e of the eutectic formed between cobalt and rare earth metals. The cathode was consumed as the molten alloy formed and dripped off and successive new sections of the cathode were lowered into the electrolyte. The alloy was collected in the form of nodules in a skull of frozen electrolyte and rare earth oxide at the bottom of the cell. At the conclusion of electro lysis, the cell was allowed to cool in the inert atmosphere chamber. The solidified electro lytic cake was then removed from the crucible and broken to recover the alloy nodules. Th e adhering electrolyte on the nodules was cleaned off by grinding. The summary of operating data for preparing all the cobalt alloys are listed in Table 6.14. There are two major benefits to using this cell arrangement. The electrolysis takes place at a temperature above the melting temperat ure of the eutectic between cobalt and the rare earth but below the melting point of coba lt, and the low melting alloy formed dripped off the cathode to the cell bottom which is at a lower temperature than the cathode zone. One benefit is that the reaction between the rare earth alloy and the electrolyte is minimized; the other benefit is that the frozen electrolyte skull prevents contact between the product and graphite crucible. During electrolysis the alloy product coales ced well and nodules weighing as much as 60 g each were formed. The compositions of the alloys formed are also given in Table 6.14. The proportions of cobalt and rare earth meta ls in the alloy products corresponded to the lowest melting eutectics in the RE–Co system and in any given experiment, the concen- tration of cobalt usually varied by less than 3% among the nodules. In the products obtained using mixed oxide feed, the con centrations of certain rare ear th metals contained in the alloy products did not correspond to their pr oportions in the oxide feed. The reason may be traceable to the difference in the concentrations of the individual rare earths in the electro- lyte, the difference in their readiness to form al loys with cobalt at a given temperature, and the difference in their reaction rates with the electrolyte. The rare earth cobalt alloys directly prod uced by electrolysis were relatively low in impurities. They were rich in rare earth metals and were found to be suitable for the prepa- ration of rare earth cobalt compounds with th e addition of more coba lt by melting. Then the compounds can be processed into fine partic le permanent magnets by pulverization and consolidation. It is seen in Table 6.14 that the cathode current efficiency varied widely among the various rare earth alloys. Low current effici ency is probably caused by reactions between the rare earth metals and the electrolytes. This was rather prevalent in the electrolytic prepa- ration of samarium cobalt alloy. Samarium metal reacts with the SmF3–LiF electrolyte 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 389 2SmF3 + Sm → 3SmF2 resulting in not only low yield but also a co ating of dark red salt that was rich in SmF2, on the alloy nodules. In some experiments, BaF2 was added to the electrolyte for improving the product recovery, but it was foun d that Sm also reacted with SmF3–LiF–BaF2 electro- lyte. Morrice and Wong (1978) found that the ra te of reaction of electrowon samarium with the electrolyte (SmF3–LiF eutectic) increased markedly with increase in the temperature of the electrolyte. To reduce the amount of back reaction, it was desirable to deposit samarium on the consumable cobalt cathode and to collect the samarium cobalt alloy product at as low a temperature as possibl e. However, high temperature increases the solubility of Sm2O3 in the electrolyte and augments the formation of samarium cobalt alloy at the cathode. It therefore follows that to obtain the best cell operation for Sm–Co alloy preparation, the cell will have to be a thermal gradient cell. Morrice and Wong (1978) obtained samarium cobalt alloy by fused salt electrolysis in a thermal gradient cell. The electrolyte was a SmF3–LiF eutectic with a composition of 25 mole % (73%) SmF3 and 75 mole % (27%) LiF and a eutectic temperature of 690°C. The cell enabled the following conditions to be realized. (1) At the Sm2O3 feed zone the temperature of the electrolyte was such that (high) sufficient dissolved Sm2O3 was available for electrolysis, (2) at the cathode zone the temperature was such that the liquid samarium cobalt alloy formed and dripped off the cathode, and (3) at the alloy collection zone the temperature was such that the reactio n rate between samarium cobalt alloy product and the electrolyte was minimum.

The electrolyte was contained in a 125 mm diameter by 150 mm deep graphite crucible. The cell was heated internally by passing AC between two fluted 19 mm diameter anodes. As much as 6 kW of AC power could be applied to the upper 25 to 38 mm of the molten electrolyte, and this arrangement enabled maintaining a temperatur e difference of 300°C between the upper and lower portions of the bath. A 6 mm diameter cobalt rod was used as the cathode. The cathode rod was electrically insulated from the t op or anolyte portion of the bath by a boron nitride sleeve. To collect the samarium co balt alloy product, a perforated molybdenum basket was suspended in the electrolyte dir ectly below the cathode. The temperature at which the samarium cobalt alloy was prepared and collected could thus be selected by raising or lowering the cathode and the prod uct collection basket. After electrolysis, the basket containing alloy product as nodules woul d be lifted off the molten bath to drain out the excess electrolyte. The optimum cell operating data for the ther mal gradient cell and product analysis are given in Table 6.15. The current efficiency achieved was 50+% which is approximately double the current efficiency achieved for Sm –Co alloy in a usual oxide fluoride electro- lysis cell. 6.8.2 Preparation of Magnets In the attempts, beginning in 1968, to prod uce usable high density permanent magnets from RECo5 alloys, the initial approach was to grind the alloys, SmCo5, La1–xRExCo5, and oooooo Figure 6.16 Schematic of the thermal gradiant electrolytic cell for Sm–Co alloy prepar- ation (Morrice and Wong 1978).06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 391 MMCo5, which was followed by alignment and pres sing of the powders mixed with chemi- cal binders (Buschow et al. 1968, Velge and Buschow 1968, Strnat et al. 1968, Westendorp and Buschow 1969). However, the interest in the plastic bonded magnets decreased after the first successful preparation of sintered magnets in 1969. In the mid-seventies, the plastic bonded magnets attracted at tention once again (Menth et al. 1978) because they are not brittle and are easy to handle and machine. There are two types of magnets sintered and plastic bonded, which are made from RECo5 magnetic materials. Sintered Magnets The sintered magnets were first reported by Das (1969). Several sub- sequent investigations focused on sintering and the sintering technology was eventually optimized for SmCo5 as well as for other RECo5 alloys (Menth et al. 1978). A schematic representation of the producti on steps involved are given in Figure 6.17. The starting alloy may be obtained either by direct melting or by the direct alloy processes of reduction dif- fusion or co-reduction. In general, the major steps in the preparat ion of these magnets are blending of the starting alloys, milling of the mixture, si ntering of the green powder compact, and the post-sintering heat treatment. Blending During the blending, samarium loss can occur due to evaporation and oxidation; therefore, the process should begin with a starting compos ition having an excess of Sm. This is done either by starti ng with an alloy of composition SmCo5–x or by starting with a mixture of two alloys with different Sm contents, for example, SmCo5 and a Sm-rich sinter additive (e.g., 60% Sm–40% Co). As an other alternative, a mixture of two alloys, SmCo5+x and SmCo5–x, may be used (Naastepad et al. 1973). The important point is thatTable 6.15 Operating data and product analysis for Sm–Co alloy preparation in the thermal gradient cell (Morrice and Wong 1978) Electrolyte composition, % 73 SmF3–27 LiF Direct current, A 40 Direct current, V 36Alternating current*, A 66 Alternating current*, V 55 Initial anode current density**, A cm –20.6 Initial cathode current density**, A cm–25.2 Oxide feed zone temperature, °C 953Cathode zone temperature, °C 720Time of electrolysis, min 50 Cobalt cathode consumed, g 13 Samarium-cobalt recovered 42Samarium content, % 79 Cathode current efficiency, % 53 Analysis of remelted samarium cobalt alloy product *Supplemental powder applied to anode. **Calculated using the initial cathode surface area.Element Al C Cr Co Cu Fe Mg Mo Mn Ni O Sm Content 0.04 0.17 0.003 43.5 0.04 0.02 0.003 0.46 0.07 0.15 0.05 55.606 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 392 the samarium content must be so chosen that no Sm2Co17 phase is present in the final SmCo5 magnets. Similarly, in the production of Sm2Co17 magnets, the starting composition must ensure that no Co phase is present in the final sintered magnet. Inclusions of such a second phase would adversel y affect the coercivity field. Milling Many critical parameters need to be controlled during the milling process. They are grain size, grain size distribution, dama ge to crystal structure, and the loss of Sm due to oxidation. The loss of Sm is kept low by exclusion of air and water vapor. The tech- niques of milling that fulfill the stated cond itions are ball milling under toluene or petro- leum ether, and jet milling with dry nitrogen as working gas. The resulting average grain size of the powder should be comparable to the initial diameter for a single domain particle. Usually the alloys are milled into particles of about 3–7 µm average size. In the final magnets, a good magnetic homogeneity is achie ved if the grain size distribution is narrow. Grains that are too small have a high struct ural defect density and an unfavorable surface to volume ratio giving rise to a high oxidat ion rate. Grains that are too large no longer exhibit single domain character and may not be single crystals, resulting in poor magnetic alignment of the powder. Aligning and pressing The powder is compacted in a die to 60–70% of bulk density, usually with a ~800–2400 kA/m magnetic field applied to achieve grain orientation. Sometimes the die pressing is followed by further isostatic compaction. Sintering The aligned green compacts are sintered under an atmosphere of argon, helium, or vacuum. The objective is to obtain an optimum combination of high density (i.e., high remanence) and high coercive field. It is necessary to have a constant and well-defined sintering temperature to ensure that the magn et has no open porosity and that no grain growth occurs that would have a detrimenta l effect on the coercive field. For SmCo5 the sintering temperature is 1120°C, and for MM0.85Sm0.15Co5 it is 1050°C. Sintering usually Figure 6.17 Flowsheet for sintered rare earth-cobalt permanent magnet production (Strnat 1988). 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 393 lasts for 30 min to 1 h. Sintering in H2 above 1100°C is also possible if suitable precautions are taken to avoid hydride formation (Jones et al. 1977). Hot pressing has also been used to prepare good magnets (Strnat 1978). Heat treatment A post-sintering heat tr eatment is used to increase the coercive field of RECo5 as well as RE2Co17 magnets. For SmCo5, the optimum annealing temperature is 900°C, and for MM0.85Sm0.15Co5 it is 950°C. The beneficial effects of annealing RECo5 magnets include (1) gradual removal of the lattice defects that determine the nucleation of the reversed domains, (2) decrease of local inhomogeneities in composition, and (3) partial precipitation in the grain boundaries of the oxygen that is dissolved in the magnetic phase during sintering. Following annealing, the magn et has to be cooled to room temperature at a carefully controlled rate depending on its mass and sh ape. Cooling too slowly can result in the eutectoidal decomposition of the 1:5 phase to the 2:17 phase and associated lattice defects, adversely affecting the coercive field. Coolin g too fast, on the other hand, can create micro- scopic cracks and internal stresses that advers ely influence both the stability of the magnets against oxidation and the coercivity. The magnetic properties of the products obtained in the above procedure depend greatly on the many parameters , including composition, partic le size, alignment, sintering conditions, and the final heat treatment. Close quality control for all the processing steps is important as its presence or absence is made obvious by the product magnet’s hysteresis loop shape, the spread of properties in a pro duction lot, the magnitude of irreversible flux losses on heating, and the long term stabilit y of the magnets (Strnat 1978). A well-sintered magnet at high mass density and a high Hk (the reverse field that reduces the flux density to 0.9 Br) displays low irreversible losses during short-term hea ting and good long-term aging stability, especially at elevated temperatures in air. Precipitation Hardened Magnets The copper containing rare earth magnets can in principle be produced by casting (Naastepad et al. 1973) followed by processing by zone melting or recrystallization to promote direct ional grain growth. Such magnets are brittle and are not in commercial use. All commercial magnets of the copper type, near the 1–5, 1–7, or 2–17 compositions, are made by the powder metallurgical route shown in Figure 6.18. Only a single powder (n o Sm–Co additive or sintering ai d) is used. For these magnets, Figure 6.18 Flowsheet for the preparation of precipitation hardened magnets.06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 394 milling and sintering are less critical compared to the procedure for fine particle magnets. The powder particles have to be single crystals so that they can be aligned easily in a mag- netic field; however, they need not be single domain particles as is necessary for nucleation type magnets. The choice of grain size can be based on requirements of minimal oxidation and optimum sintering kinetics. No negative influence on the hard magnetic properties comes from grain growth during sintering. The sintering temperature of the Sm(Co,Cu, TM)5<z<7.5 alloys must be below the peritectic temp erature. TM here represents a transition metal. For example, for Sm(Co0.84,Cu0.16)7.2 the sintering temperature of 1180°C (peri- tectic temperature ≈ 1220°C) results in an almost 100% theoretical density for the magnet. The coercive field in these alloys is relativel y low, at about 72 kA/m, after sintering. The coercive field can be improved by up to a f actor of six by an appropriate annealing that results in an optimum density and precipitate size. Machining, handling, and magnetizing Sintered RE–Co magnets present certain problems in machining, handling, an d magnetizing. They are hard and brittle. Machining them involves slic ing with diamond blades, and surface grinding or cutting on spark erosion machines in a de magnetized state. The high HC and low recoil permeability of rare earth permanent magnets (REPM) allo ws precharging and manipulation in an open circuit and they will not self-demagnetize. For larger high energy magnets, however, machining, shipping, and handling in the magneti zed state are difficult. It is therefore often necessary to magnetize after partial assembly of a device. This can be problematic. HighH C 2–17 magnets and SmCo5, first charged and then field demagnetized, need up to 4 MA/m for saturation. This demands expensiv e magnetizing equipment and may not be at all possible for larger assembli es. Incompletely magnetized SmCo5 magnets can display severe thermal instabilities of the flux. Some of these limitations are circumvented in the bonded magnets, which are also attractive for many more reasons. Bonded Magnets The RE–TM based bonded or matrix magnets were first introduced in the late 1960s, but their commercial deve lopment was slow. There were difficulties relating to chemical reactivity of the powd er and inexpensive manufacturing methods. Earlier products were made from 5–20 µm particles of SmCo5 bonded with epoxy, poly- ethylene chloride, or ethylene vinyl acetate. These deteriorated very quickly at tem- peratures above 50°C and were not magnetical ly very stable even at room temperature (Strnat et al. 1976). Much improvement was brought about by coating the particles with metallic or organic diffusion barriers and with careful selection of compatible polymeric binders. The most important development was the introduction of alloys bulk hardened with copper. Used as coarse powders ( ≈ 20–200 µm), these did not suffer the severe sensitivity of Hc to the particle surface condition. They were, therefore, much more stable. Another way of improving the elevated temperat ure stability was to use a soft metal matrix. Alloys with compositions close to the 2–17 stoichiometry and with higher Fe content were developed particularly for bonded magnets. Methods developed for producing ingots witha coarse columnar grain structure obviated the need for presintered blocks for making bonded magnets. Moreover, the adaptation of inexpensive molding methods such as extrusion and injection molding in an orientin g field encouraged large-scale production and industrial applications of the bo nded rare earth permanent magnets. The schematic flowsheet for the producti on of polymer bonded RE–Co magnets is given in Figure 6.19 (Strnat et al. 1976). The RE–Co alloy was converted to a powder com- prising mostly single crystal particles of suffi ciently high coercive force. The powder was stabilized and/or magnetically hardened before sizing and blending w ith a binder. Then the blend was exposed to a magnetic field that magnetizes and orients the particles, the mass 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 395 was compacted, and the binder was hardened. In an alternative procedure, the magnetic powder alone was compressed into a porous bo dy that was then infiltrated with a liquid binder that subsequently solidified. The po lymer bonded magnets were produced in two basic forms. One form was as rigid bodies with thermosetting or chemically hardened resin binder, and the other was as flexible sheets or strips with a thermoplastic or rubber binder (Strnat et al. 1976). Such magnets were generally made from SmCo5 powder and were anisotropic by field alignment of the particle s. The energy products of plastic bonded mag- nets ranged from 25 to >135 kJ/m3. The 2–17 alloys were used in the upper end, SmCo5 in the middle, and alloys with MM substitution in the low Br region. As regards the mag- netic properties of the bonded magnets, the best compression molded 2–17 matrix magnets offer room temperature properties equi valent to medium grade sintered SmCo5. They are, however, far superior to any non-RE magnet type. Injection molded magnets are com- mercially attractive because of the low cost of processing but they had significantly poorer Br, Hci and loop shape. Metal matrix magnets with 2–17 alloy, a Sn–Pb binder and Cu filler have been prepared to obtain magnet sets with precisely controlled variable saturation (Strnat and Strnat 1991). The most important advantag e of matrix bonding is inexpensive mass production. This comes about because of the possibility of molding magnets or even subassemblies to final shapes with close tolerances. There is little cutting scrap or grinding loss, and machining, when necessary, can be done with conventional machine tools. Compared to sintered magnets, there are fewer handling problems with bonded magnets. As regards mechanical behavior, the bonded magnets are so mewhat ductile (metal matrix) and elastic or even flexible (plastic or rubber binders) . At dense packing they are moderately brittle. The bonded magnets can be conveniently produ ced in much larger sizes than the sintered ones without ending up with property inho mogeneities, or cracking and warping by uneven shrinkage, which are size-limiting factors for the sintered bodies. Figure 6.19 Schematic flowsheet for the production of bonded RE–Co magnets. 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 396 The samarium cobalt magnets proved to be attractive replacements for the older ferrites, Pt–Co and Alnico permanent magn ets, and also for electromagnets in many applications. Their use has all along been constrained by economic disadvantages. Among the light rare earths, samarium is the least abundant and hence most expensive, and this unfavorable situation is aggravated by the fact that the price and ava ilability of cobalt are subject to largely unpredictable excursions. The bulk of the world’s cobalt is mined in Zaire and the 1978 civil war there dried up the supplies. This drastically intensified the worldwide search for alternative RE–TM sy stems having economically more acceptable elemental constituents. Neodymium–iron–boron magnets were discovered and developed as a consequence. 6.9 NEODYMIUM–IRON–BORON MAGNETS Even though iron-based materials having th e characteristics of samarium–cobalt had long been desired, no suitable compounds were known. RE–Fe phases having CaCu5 structure do not exist and REFe17 compounds in which RE is a light rare earth have an unusually low Curie temperature. Two lines of research, on e relying on the rapid solidification by melt spinning of rare earth–iron–metalloid alloys and the other based on conventional powder metallurgy gave encouraging results by the early 1980s. Croat et al. (1984, 1984a) reported energy products as large as 112 kJ/m3 in melt spun ribbons of Nd0.135Fe0.817B0.048, and Sagawa et al. (1984) applied traditional sintering met hods to ternary light rare earth–iron systems and obtained (BH)max ~ 288 kJ/m3 for Nd0.15Fe0.77B0.08. Both of these high (BH)max materials, rapidly solidified as well as sintered, contained a novel ternary crystal- line compound Nd2Fe14B. The larger energy product reported by Sagawa et al. (1984) came from the crystalline orientation provided by the powder metallurgy procedure. Nd2Fe14B immediately attracted considerable technological interest because of its excellent intrinsic magnetic properties [(BH)*max~ 512 kJ/m3, Ha ~ 5840 kA/m] as well as economic advan- tages over samarium–cobalt materials. Practical magnets with energy products in the range of 320–400 kJ/m3, values that are significantly larger than any attained previously, were prepared from melt spun (Croat 1989, Lee 1985) and sintered (Sagawa et al. 1987) alloys. Large-scale production programs following bo th the approaches have been subsequently implemented. The overall process for the production of Nd–Fe–B magnets has two major stages. One is the production of magnetic alloy and the other is processing of the Nd–Fe–B alloy into permanent magnets. 6.9.1 Production of Nd–Fe–B Alloys Many methods have been developed for the production of neodymium iron robon (Nd–Fe–B) alloys (Agarwal et al. 1988). They include direct melting, co-reduction, and several special techniques that make use of reduction extraction or thermit type processes for directly making the Nd–Fe or Nd–Fe–B alloys. Direct Melting The direct melting method was us ed by Ormerod (1985) at Philips Electronic Components and Materials Division , The Netherlands, to prepare the Nd–Fe–B alloy. The target composition in their vacu um induction melting was 15 at % Nd, 77 at %06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 397 Fe, and 8 at % B, which was the comp osition reported by Sagawa et al. (1984) as giving the optimum magnetic properties. The alloy was prepared from 99.9% Fe, 99.9% Nd, and 99.8% B. The iron and boron was initially melted in an alumina crucible under argon. After degassing under vacuum, the melt temperature wa s allowed to come down to just above the liquidus and neodymium was added. Correctio ns were made for any anticipated melting losses. The melt was then cast in a thick wa lled copper mold with a 5 mm cavity. The advantage of vacuum induction melting is th at it can yield a wide range of alloy com- positions with very low (<200 ppm) oxygen contents; however, pure elemental starting materials are needed. Kaneko and Ishigaki (1994) have used fe rroboron as the source of boron in the preparation of Nd–Fe–B alloy by direct melti ng. Using 99.5% pure rare earth metals, 99.9% pure electrolytic iron and fe rroboron, as raw materials, the (Nd,Pr,Dy)12.5–15 Fe77–81.5 B6–8 alloys were prepared by induction melting in an argon atmosphere. The as-cast alloy was subseque ntly put through a homogenization treatment by heating for 5 h at 1000°C, befo re it was converted to powder. Nd–Fe–B alloys have also been made by ar c melting. For exampl e, an alloy of 81.5 at % Fe, 13 at % Nd and 5.5 at % B was prepared by arc melting Nd–17.5% Fe master alloy, electrolytic iron and crystalline boron, under a continuous flow of ultrapure argon. To minimize segregation and achieve composit ional homogeneity in the alloy, the arc melted ingot was remelted four times. The ar c melted alloy was subsequently induction melted before processing by rapid solidification. Co-reduction In continuation of their earlier wo rk on Sm–Co alloys, efforts were on at Th. Goldschmidt AG in Germany to make the Nd–Fe–B type of materials by the calcio- thermic reduction technique soon after the fi rst announcement of the Nd–Fe–B magnets at the 29th MMM Conference in Pittsburgh in November 1983 (Sagawa et al. 1984). The technique was successfully applied the fi rst time in October 1984 (Herget 1985). Co-reduction was based on the following overall reaction. 7.5Nd2O3 + 50.7Fe + Fe2O3 + 0.143Fe44B56 + 52.5Ca Nd15Fe77B8 + 52.5CaO The source of boron used in the above reaction was commercial ferroboron powder containing 20% boron. The conditions for ca rrying out the above reaction were essentially similar to those used for co-reduction of Sm2O3 and Co3O4 because the difference of the free energies of formation between Sm2O3 and CaO on the one hand and between Nd2O3 and CaO on the other are similar. Calculated quantities of the starting materials were thoroughly mixed, pressed into pellets, and lo aded in crucibles made of high temperature resistant steel. The crucibles were closed by welding except for an opening for evacuation and put in a vertical position into electric furnaces. These furnaces were evacuated and heated to reaction temperature. The Nd–Fe–B alloy exhibits a much great er tendency for oxidation compared to SmCo5 (Herget 1985), and this introduces differ ences in the process used for separation of the alloy powder from the CaO slag. A ne w and proprietary leaching procedure was developed and used by Th. Goldschmidt AG for the separation of alloy and CaO, and thisprocess kept the oxygen content at 0.20% or even less in alloys with >40% Nd. The co-reduction process has been used by Herget (1985) not only to achieve a neodymium content of above 40% in the Nd–Fe– B alloy, but also to add/incorporate rare earth or alloying elements such as Dy, Al, Nb, or Co in th e product. The alloy powders1100–1200°C vacuum, 4 h06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 398 produced typically contained O: 0.12–0.25% , C: 0.03–0.04%, Ca: 0.03–0.06%, and Al: 0.01–0.20% as residual impurities. The Al impurity was derived from the aluminum content of ferroboron, which was itself produc ed by an aluminotherm ic reduction process. If elemental boron were used instead of th e aluminothermic ferroboron, the Al content could have been avoided. Herget (1985) noted that the alloy powder picked up oxygen, and its oxygen content tended to increase even when stored in sealed plastic bags. The calciothermic production of Nd–Fe–B allo ys has also been used by a group at the Beijing University of Iron and Steel Technolo gy (Herget 1985). The reduction process was carried out at ambient pressure under argo n. The details of the procedure for aqueous treatments for alloy–CaO separation were not disclosed in these investigations. The advantages of the calciothermic tech nique are high alloy yields, immediate production of powder that is so fine that it ca n be directly fed into the fine milling stage without prior crushing, wide variability regarding the number of components as well as alloy compositions, and cost a dvantages because of using commercial oxide as the starting materials. There are certain disadvantages al so. They are the high cost of the calcium reducing agent, the batch-wise nature of the reduction operation, and interestingly, the powder form of the product. Alloy in the fo rm of powder hampers its use for the magnet manufacturing process originally adopted by General Motors. The neodymium alloy powders with their high surface area and hen ce possibility of quick oxidation are not very suitable to melting, and melting precedes melt spinning and quenching as practiced by the General Motors process. Lump metals are preferred. Production of Consolidated Alloys There are two basic routes to production of metallic rare earth alloys and several comp anies have developed their own proprietary modifications of these basic routes to make neodymium alloys for magnets (Agarwal et al. 1988). The two major routes are based on oxid e as the starting mate rial but differ in the reduction step. Oxide reduction can be carried out by using calcium as the reductant for the oxide or after converting the oxide to fluoride , or the reduction is achieved by a fused salt electrolysis technique. The modifications an d the major unit operations involved are summarized in Figure 6.20 and Figure 6.21. The outlined processes and their modifications have been used for making neodymium alloys by Molycorp Research Chemicals, Comur- hex, Goldschmidt, General Motors, Ronson, and Santoku. Molycorp The schematic flowsheet of th e Molycorp process is shown in Figure 6.20. The process used was calciothermic redu ction of neodymium fluoride prepared from the carbonate by a wet process. Neodymium nitrate was made from the carbona te by an aqueous process. The nitrate was fed to a batch precipitation reactor at a co ntrolled rate with excess hydrofluoric acid. The solution pH was controlled by adding sodi um hydroxide solution. At the end of the reaction, the reactor contents were passed th rough a continuous filter where the neodymium fluoride precipitate was removed and thoroughly washed. The filtrate was neutralized, and excess fluoride was precipitated from it by the addition of lime. Water was removed from the neodymium fluorid e precipitate by first feeding it to a dryer for removal of adhering moisture and th en feeding it to a calciner for removing water of hydration. Calcination was carried out in an atmosphere of hydrogen fluoride, which was obtained from an HF still. The off-gases we re scrubbed and neutralized. The calcined product was stored under nitrogen. Anhydrous neodymium fluoride was blende d batch-wise with an excess of calcium granules. The mixture was loaded in tantalum crucibles and reduced in an induction furnace06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 399 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The furnace was pr ovided with a solids charging system and a crucible tilting mechanism. Thus, portions of calcium fluoride/calcium slag could be poured off and the crucible recharged twice during the course of reduction. The decanted slag was solidified and disposed of, and th e reduced neodymium was cast into molds for purification. As-reduced neodymium metal was purified by vacuum melting in an induction furnace. Purification needed high vacuum an d a long duration. Th e purified neodymium was cast into molds for alloying. Alloying wa s carried out by adding iron and ferroboron in controlled amounts to pure neodymium me tal and alloy melting was carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere. The alloy was cast in molds and analyzed. “Off-spec” material was recycled and acceptable material was sold for magnet manufacturing. Research chemicals The route followed is calciothermic reduction of neodymium fluoride and the fluoride was prepared fro m the oxide by a dry process. The schematic flowsheet is shown in Figure 6.20 as the Ames process. Neodymium oxide was blended with a large excess (100%) of ammonium bifl uoride and the mixture was charged to a drum type fluorinating reactor. This batch reactor was operated with a programmed temperature cycle. The charge was heated to first convert the oxide to the complex fluoride and then to remove the unreacted excess bifluoride. The complex fluoride was then decomposed by heating in vacuum and the product fluoride wa s calcined. The drum was rotated during the reaction period to effect mixing of the phas es. The calcined fluoride was cooled, removed from the reactor, and stored un der nitrogen. The fluoride was processed to the magnet alloy using the same equipment and procedure as that described for the Molycorp process. Figure 6.20 Preparation of Nd–Fe–B alloys-I (a) Molycorp process, (b) Ames process, (c) Comurhex process, (d) General Motors process, (e) Goldschmidt process. 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 400 During fluorination, the initial gaseous r eaction products, ammonium fluoride, water, and unreacted hydrogen fluoride, were removed from the reactor in a stream of nitrogen and were scrubbed with water for disposal. At the time of excess bifluoride removal, the off gases passed through switching condensers where the bifluoride was collected as a solid. This was scrubbed and the scrub solution was treated with sufficient lime to bring the pH to near neutral. The solution was then cl arified, the overflow discharged, and the sludge disposed. The condensers that had collected the bifluori de were heated sequentially to above the solid’s (ammonium bifluoride) melting point and the liquid was pumped to a scrapped surface heat exchanger for solidifica tion. The bifluoride was recycled. Comurhex The schematic flowsheet of th e Comurhex process is shown in Figure 6.20. The key step was an adiabatic calciotherm ic reduction of a mixture of neodymium and iron fluorides. The wet process described earlier for the Mo lycorp flowsheet was used for the prepa- ration of neodymium fluoride. Iron fluoride wa s prepared by reaction of iron chloride with gaseous hydrogen fluoride that was obtained by stripping a portion of the hydrofluoric acid used in neodymium nitrate precipitation. Hot and dry iron chloride, obtained by feeding iron chloride continuously to a dryer/preheater , was fed to a fluoridizing reactor in which excess hydrogen fluoride was fed countercurre ntly. The reactor was staged and cooled to control the temperature profile. The reactor off-gas contained hydrogen chloride, excess hydrogen fluoride, and some iron chloride. It was scrubbed with wa ter and then disposed. The scrub solution was discharged after fluori de removal by liming and clarification. The iron fluoride was cooled in the final reactor stage and collected warm for storage. It wasstored under nitrogen. Figure 6.21 Preparation of Nd–Fe–B alloys-II (f) Ronson process, (g) Santoku process (IMR). 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 401 Neodymium fluoride, iron fluoride, and ex cess calcium were mixed in a proportion sufficient to produce a reaction product mass at a temperature between 1100 and 1200°C, adiabatically. The mixture was loaded around a mandrel and compressed into steel reactor vessels. These vessels were jacketed and were designed to withstand an internal pressure of 7 MPa. A tantalum cup was fitted below th e charge to collect the alloy product. An ignitor charge comprising calcium and iron fl uoride was placed over the top of the charge. After loading the reactor, it was purged with nitrogen and the charge was ignited. The reaction proceeded rapidly from the core to th e outside where it was quenched by the cold material in contact with the wall. The redu ced iron–neodymium alloy has a relatively low melting point and drained through the calcium fluoride slag into the tantalum cup. After cooling, the reactor was opened, the alloy was retrieved from the tantalum cup, and the slag was removed from the reactor for disposal. The unreacted charge adhering to the wall was separately collected and recycled for blending with fresh material. The crude NdFe alloy was purified by vacu um melting and adjusted to the required final composition in alloy melting furnaces by the procedure described for the Molycorp process. Th. Goldschmidt The schematic flowsheet of the Th. Goldschmidt process for producing neodymium iron boron alloy is sh own in Figure 6.20. Neodymium alloy powder of desired composition was directly produced by a calciothermic reduction of a proportion- al mixture of neodymium oxide, iron, and ferroboron. Neodymium oxide was mixed with a slight excess of iron and ferroboron and the mixture was heated to remove traces of mois ture and kept in a nitrogen atmosphere. Calcium, in a suitable excess quantity, was bl ended with this mixture and the charge was fed to the press for compaction. The pellets were loaded into holding vessels and the vessels were closed and purged with nitrogen and then with argon. These vessels were then trans- ported to electrically heated furnaces, where th ey were heated to the reaction temperature. After completion of the reaction, the vessel s were removed from the furnace, allowed to cool and the contents were discharged in to holding bins under an argon atmosphere. The reduced alloy was liberated from the sl ag by grinding the reaction product in a closed circuit ball mill under liquid hexane. From the finely ground material, hexane was removed by evaporation in a wiped surface evaporator and the ground material was transferred to surge bins under argon atmo sphere. The material now contained unreduced reactant, excess calcium, and calcium oxide in addition to the product alloy. The other materials were separated from the alloy by a proprietary leaching process in which pH and Eh were carefully controlled and nitric acid, a chelating agent, or other chemicals were probably used for selective leaching. The leach effluent was filtered to recover the solid product. The product was washed with deoxygen ated water, dried, and stored under argon. The filtrate was treated with lime to neut ralize excess acid and precipitate dissolved neodymium and iron as hydrous oxides. Th e effluent was clarified and the overflow discharged. The sludge was also disposed. The product was quality controlled, and “on- spec” material was stored in lined con- tainers under inert gas. The off-spec material wa s either used for blending or was converted to ingot in an alloy furnace after the ad dition of required boron or ferroboron. General Motors The schematic flowsheet of the process is shown in Figure 6.20. The key process is the calciothermic reductio n of a mixture of neodymium oxide and iron that takes place in a molten salt mixture in a stirred tank reactor. Neodymium oxide was blended with iron and the mixture was heated to remove traces of moisture. The dried material was stored under an inert atmosphere. The quantities of06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 402 neodymium oxide and iron were chosen so th at on reduction of the oxide, neodymium and iron would form an alloy of eutectic composit ion. Calcium and sodium chlorides were also blended and heated before loading them in to the reduction reactor as make up. The iron–neodymium mixture was blended with excess calcium and the charge was kept in surge bins under an inert atmosphere for feeding to the reactor. The reduction was carried out in a tantal um-lined electrically heated stirred tank reactor. The reactor was charged with the required amount of salt mixture, and a heel of eu- tectic alloy and solids was melted. The temper ature was raised to ~750°C, and the neodymi- um oxide–iron charge was fed to the reactor at a controlled rate with high agitation for a predetermined period. Charge feeding was th en interrupted, agitation was decreased and then stopped to permit the phases to settle , and the molten alloy product was removed by bottom tapping. This cycle was repeated many times while the unreacted calcium and neodymium oxide and the calcium oxide slag were being retained within the reactor. At the conclusion of the cycles, all of the eutectic was removed and the salt, which contained large amounts of solids, was discharged for dispos al. The NdFe eutectic was vacuum purified and alloyed to the final composition by the same procedure as described for Molycorp. Ronson The schematic flowsheet of the process used by Ronson is shown in Figure 6.21. The process is an electrochemical reduction of neodymium chloride by electro- lysis in a mixture of fused chloride salts using a consumable iron cathode. Neodymium chloride was prepared from ne odymium oxide by chlorination in the presence of carbon. The oxide was mixed with excess carbon and a binder, and the mixture was compacted into pellets. The green pell ets were dried and screened. The undersize pellets were recycled and the others held in surge. Chlorination was carried out in a shaft furnace. The pellets fed to the top of the shaf t furnace descend against a countercurrent flow of heated chlorine gas. The neodymium chlo ride formed is molten at the prevailing temperature. It drained from the reactor into a heated enclosed receiver. Unreacted oxide and excess carbon were settled and skimmed in the receiver. The furnace off-gas containing excess chlorine and carbon oxides was scrubbed with off-gas from the electrolytic cells to remove chlorine. The liquid neodymium chloride from the ch lorination furnace was transferred under inert atmosphere to an exchanger for solidifica tion. The solid chloride was held warm under nitrogen for charging to the electrolytic cells . The electrolyte components, sodium chloride, and potassium chloride were mixed, heated un der an inert atmosphere to remove moisture, and were held for changing to the cell. Elect rolysis was carried out in cells with carbon anodes and a consumable iron cathode. Neod ymium–iron alloy formed at the cathode was collected at the cell bottom and tapped periodi cally. Chlorine was evolved at the anode. The gas was scrubbed in an oxidizing solution of calcium hydroxide, and the resulting solution of soluble chloride salt was released. During electrolysis impurities in the charge materials, especially the oxychlorides, accumulated in the electrolyte and the electrolyte must be purged to remove them. The crude alloy obtained from the electrolytic cell was purified by vacuum melting to remove volatile chlorides and was then alloyed with iron and ferroboron as in the Molycorp process. Santoku The schematic flowsheet of the Santoku process is given in Figure 6.21. The process involves electrolytic reduction of the neodymium oxide in a fused fluoride electrolyte and recovery of the metal as the iron alloy. Neodymium oxide was dried by heating to re move the moisture, and the dry oxide was stored under an inert atmosphere for chargi ng to the cell. A portion of the oxide was06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 403 converted to the fluoride, using ammonium bifluoride as the fl uorinating agent under conditions described for the Research Ch emicals/Ames flowsheet. Neodymium fluoride was mixed with barium fluoride and lithium fl uoride, and the mixture was dried by heating to remove the trace amounts of water. The dry fluorides mixture was stored under inert gas cover for charging to the cells. Electrolysis was carried out in cells equipp ed with carbon anodes and iron cathodes. The cathode was consumable as the reduced ne odymium metal alloys with the iron forming a low melting eutectic that wa s collected in tantalum liners at the cell bottom. Oxides of carbon were formed at the carbon anode. Th ese gases were vented and scrubbed for discharge. The cells were loaded with the fluoride el ectrolyte mixture and heated to melt the electrolyte and attain the cell operating temper ature. The oxide was charged at a controlled rate and the molten alloy product was bottom tapped periodically. Unreacted oxide and other impurities collected in the electrolyte and they were purged. The neodymium–iron alloy obtained from the cell was first purified mechanically to remove adhering electrolyte and then charged to the alloy melting furn ace. This furnace was equipped with a vacuum system and was used first to purify the allo y from volatile impurities by vacuum melting after which alloying additio ns were introduced to obtain the final composition. Among the processes listed above, neodym ium recovery of about 90% was possible when calcium was the reducing agent and neodymium fluoride was the intermediate starting compound. The yield was only about 70 to 75% in the electrolytic processes because of losses caused by bleeding of the elect rolyte to control its chemical composition. The primary alloy product co ntained about 30 to 32% neodymium. This neodymium was actually 96% neodymium and 4% other rare earth metals. The processes for alloy production of rare earth metals are considered fairly straight- forward up to the primary alloy stage. Both the yield and quality control become major concerns when these primary alloys are pro cessed to fabricate the final magnet product. 6.9.2 Production of Nd–Fe–B Magnets Prior to the production of Nd–Fe–B magn ets, the Nd–Fe–B alloys that have been prepared by one or another of the above proce sses are first converted to a metallurgical or physical form suitable for further processing to magnets. The most important processing in this context is the reprocessing of the magne t alloy by the rapid so lidification technique of melt spinning. In another route the cast alloy ingot is converted to fine powder before a modified powder metallurgical consolidation to magnets. Th e second is known as the sintering route. Melt Spinning The melt spinning procedure involv es ejection of molten Nd–Fe–B alloy through a crucible orifice onto the surf ace of a substrate disc. The apparatus is shown schematically in Figure 6.22. The disc is usually made of copper because of its high thermal conductivity, and it rotates with surface velocity νs. A fine jet or stream of molten alloy is directed onto the surface of the rapidly spinni ng quench wheel. While the jet feeds a pool of liquid metal, at its point of contact with the wheel the spinning wheel extracts the metal as a thin rapidly quenched ribbon or flake. Th e process is carried out in an inert atmosphere, usually argon, because the rare earths are very reactive chemically and need to be protected from oxidation during high temperature processi ng. In melt spinning the cooling or quench rate attained is estimated to be of the order of 105 °C/s, and this rate can be varied by06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 404 changing νs. The cooling rate is directly proportional to νs. The quenched material is inherently brittle and the products are obtai ned in the form of ribbons typically 30–50 µm thick, 1–3 mm wide and having lengths on th e millimeter or centimeter scale, depending on νs. The microstructure and magnetic properties of melt-spun Nd–Fe–B ribbons are sensitively dependent upon the quench rate (H erbst and Croat 1991), which in turn depends upon νs. Plotted as a function of νs, Hci and (BH)max each exhibit a maximum. At high quench rates ( νs ≥ 30 m/s) essentially amorphous, “overquenched” materials with negligible Hci and (BH)max are obtained. At quench rates νs = 19 m/s, ribbons consisting of spheroidal Nd2Fe14B grains with an average diameter of 30 nm are obtained. These ribbons have the highest coercivities (Hci ≈ 1120 kA/m) and energy products [(BH)max ~ 112 kJ/m3]. These are optimally quenched ribbons. At νs below the value resulting in optimally quenched ribbons, ribbons composed of progressively larger Nd2Fe14B crystal- lites and characterized by decreasing Hci and (BH)max are formed. It is interesting and technologically significant that the largely am orphous, overquenched ribbons melt spun at quench rates required only to exceed a mini mum value instead of confining to a narrow interval, can be suitably annealed to nearly duplicate the properties of optimally quenched materials obtained directly. The quenched ribbon or flake is usually ground down to a fine powder before processing to consolidated magnets. Consolidation The production of bulk magnets by consolidation of melt-spun ribbons (Lee 1985, Lee et al. 1985) is accomplished by the procedures outlined in Figures 6.23a and 6.23b. The first procedure yields what ar e known as “bonded magnets,” and the second procedure results in the so-called “hot pressed magnets.” Bonded magnets Bonded Nd–Fe–B magnets are manufactured from the rapidly solidified magnetic powder (Lee 1985, Lee et al. 1985, Croat 1998). This is done in many ways. The melt-spun ribbon or flake is typical ly ground down into a finer powder before being processed into bonded magnets. At pr esent nearly 90% of the bonded neodymium magnets is produced using a compaction moldin g process. The magnetic powder is blended Figure 6.22 Schematic of the melt spinning apparatus (Ormerod 1985). 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 405 with an epoxy dissolved in a suitable organic solvent. While blending of the mixture is continuing, the solvent is draw n off resulting in a coating or encapsulation of the magnetic powder particles. The encapsulated powder is dried and then fed into a conventional powder metal press and compacted into the requ ired shape. After compaction, the parts are heated in an oven to cure the epoxy. The energy products obtained in magnets made by compaction molding are usually in the range of 80 to 88 kJ/m3. Bonded neodymium magnets are also produ ced from melt-spun powders by injection molding. This is the second most common method. The powder is first mixed or “com- pounded” with a thermoplastic material such as nylon. It is then fed to a conventional injection molding machine. The energy products of injection molded magnets are lower, in the range of 40 to 48 kJ/m3, because these magnets have a higher percentage of resin. The bonded neodymium magnets are given a coating before final assembly. The coating prevents surface oxidation and also lo ss of magnetic particles. Melt-spun ribbons are very desirable for bonded magnet producti on. Due to the extremely fine particle size, no degradation of the properties accompanies pulverization. The flat geometry of the ribbon fragments (~0.5 mm ×0.5 mm×40 µm) facilitates efficient packing so that densities of approximately 85% with respect to Nd2Fe14B can be obtained even with modest pressures of 600–700 MPa. The bonded magn et, like its constituent ribbons, is magne- tically isotropic. Hot pressed magnets The procedure based on hot pressing affords complete densification of melt-spun ribbons. The temper atures and pressures needed for hot pressing depend on the starting alloy composition. For composition near Nd0.135Fe0.817B0.048, full density was achieved using p ~ 100 MPa and T ~ 700°C. Most desirable grain size was developed by hot pressing “overquenched” ribb ons. Energy products of the hot pressed Figure 6.23 Processes for magnets from melt-spun ribbons (Tourre 1998). 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 406 magnets were in the range of 80 to 160 kJ/m3. Only a slight (~10%) crystallographic alignment of the easy C axis parallel to the press direction was introduced by the uniaxial hot pressing. Another variant of the hot pressing method, called die upsetting, results in a greater (~75%) crystallographic alignment of the easy C axis and consequently much larger energy products. In this method an initial hot press is followed by another in a die cavity of larger diameter. The second hot press in the larger die, called die upsetting, causes bulk lateral plastic flow and an accompanying reduction in ri bbon thickness. It has been found (Nozawa et al. 1988, Tokunaga et al. 1989) that the greatest magnetic alignment was achieved only if the original sample height was reduced by at least a factor of four during die upsetting. Like their hot pressed precursors, the die up set magnets are fully dense and possess energy products as high as 360 kJ/m3. Compositional modifications in magnet mate rials offer opportunities for altering the intrinsic properties of the major component and/ or the nature of secondary phases and their influence on coercivity. The Curie temp erature increases monotonically with x in the stoi- chiometric RE2Fe14–xCoxB compounds, and melt spun Nd–(Fe,Co)–B materials contain- ing Nd2Fe14–xCoxB as the principal constituent have been prepared (Wecker and Schultz 1990). In Nd2Fe14–xCoxB, the Curie temperature increases from 312°C for x = 0, through 427°C for x = 2, to 727°C, which is the Tc of SmCo5, when x = 14, i.e., for Nd2Co14B. For x ≥ 9 in the Nd2Fe14–xCoxB system; however, Br, Hci and (BH)max all vanish as T approaches a temperature Ts (which is less than Tc), and this intrinsic behavior limits the practical magnets (Herbst and Croat 1991). The coercivity of melt spun Nd–Fe–B materials is significantly increased by doping (at concentrations <5 at %) with other el ements (Herbst and Croat 1991). Niobium and zirconium are known to improve Hci of melt-spun ribbons (Koh moto et al. 1987, Wecker and Schultz 1990). Enhancement of Hci by 10–90% has been found (Fuerst and Brewer 1990, 1991) in hot pressed and die upset magn ets containing Ag, Au, Cd, Cu, Ir, Mg, Ni, Pd, Pt, Ru, or Zn. Sintered Magnets Of the two major types of Nd–Fe–B magnets, namely bonded magnets and the sintered magnets, the second is produced and consumed in quantities that Figure 6.24 Process steps for the production of sint ered rare earth permanent magnets. 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 407 are approximately four times that of the first. For example, in 1997 in Japan, the world’s largest producer of Nd–Fe–B, 3300 tons of sintered magnets were produced compared to only 830 tons of bonded ma gnets (Yan and Xiong 1998). The magnets prepared through the sequence of orient, press, sinter operations on finely divided alloy powders are designated as “sintered.” Sagawa et al. (1984) were the first to apply this method to Nd–Fe–B. Their procedure was as follows. Neodymium– iron–boron alloy having the composition Nd0.15Fe0.77B0.08 was prepared by induction melting. It may be noted that this compositi on was substantially enriched in Nd and B relative to both stoichiometric Nd2Fe14B (corresponding to ≈Nd0.12Fe0.82B0.06) as well as the optimum melt spinning composition of ≈Nd0.13Fe0.82B0.05. The ingot was crushed, milled, and pulverized to powder with a particle size of ~3 µm. The powder was aligned in a magnetic field (800 kA/m) and pressed ( P ~ 200 MPa) perpendicular to the alignment direction. The compact obtained was sintered in argon gas at ~1100°C for 1 h and cooled quickly. It was then subjected to a post-sinte r anneal at ~625°C under argon to improve the coercivity to its maximum value. By the sint ering route, which is quite similar to the process for preparing SmCo5 magnets, Nd–Fe–B magnets with energy products up to 360 kJ/m3 have been prepared (Kirchmayr 1985). In general, the steps for the production of sintered rare earth permanent magnets are as given in Figure 6.24. The Nd–Fe–B alloy, after vacuum melting and casting, is in the form of chill cast lumps. These are crushed, under a nitrogen atmosphere, in a high energy hammer mill to <500 micron particles. The pr emilled (crushed) magnet alloy is milled to produce a narrow size distribution of single cr ystal particles. Milling is carried out, for example, by vibration ball milling in an orga nic liquid under an in ert atmosphere. In the next step, the powder particles are magnetically aligned and pressed such that the easy axes of magnetization of the particles are parallel . The compaction is done by die pressing or isostatic pressing. The applied field is either DC or some combination of DC and pulsed. The compaction pressure is kept sufficient to give the powder compact enough mechanical strength for handling but not high enough to cause particle misorientation. The compacted magnets are sintered in the region of 1100°C in inert gas atmospheres or under vacuum to over 95% of theoretical density. The opti mum sintering temperature range for Nd–Fe–B magnets (Sagawa et al. 1984) is much wider (approximate ly 120°C) than that for SmCo5 magnets. In the as-sintered form itself, the properties obtained with a Nd–Fe–B magnet are such that the material forms a useful permanent magnet. A post-sintering heat treatment, usually an isothermal heat treatment in the region of 630°C for 1 h, was reported by Sagawa et al. (1984) to increase the coercivity of the Nd–Fe–B magnets. However, heat treatment do es not appear as a necessary procedure in the overall process scheme for maki ng the sintered Nd–Fe–B magnets. Generally the rare earth magnets, particular ly the SmCo magnets, are hard and brittle. The Nd–Fe–B magnets, however, are tougher and less prone to breakage and chipping. After sintering and heat treatment, the magnets are ground, and, in the case of large blocks, they are divided into even, very small magnet s by cutting and slicing. The sintered pieces are ground on conventional grinding machin es fitted with silicon carbide or diamond grinding wheels. The Nd–Fe–B magnets comb ine relative recoil permeability close to unity and high coercivity and may be magneti zed prior to assembly without flux loss. Because of the difficulty in handling magnetized and brittle material, it is usual that magne- tization is carried out during system assembly. RE magnets are, in general, prone to corro sion. They get exposed to aggressive media such as acids, alkalis, salts, lubricants, and also gases. They need to be protected. High06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 408 humidity or dew formation is sufficient to cause corrosion in the case of Nd–Fe–B. The magnets are protected from corrosion by coating them. Metallic coatings, for example, of nickel or tin, are applied by galvanic proces ses. Coating also ensures that the magnets can be cleaned thoroughly free of all magnet dust. After the magnet is put into its final shape, it is magnetized to saturation. This is done using very high magnetic fields, using cap acitor discharge magnetizers. Magnetization is done only parallel to the magnetic orientat ion set during particle alignment pressing. The powder metallurgical fabrication of Nd –Fe–B magnets is facilitated not only by the superior intrinsic properties of Nd2Fe14B but also by the fact that Nd2Fe14B, Nd, and the tetragonal compound Nd1+∈Fe4B4 form a ternary eutectic which makes possible liquid phase sintering resulting in high densificati on without significant grain growth (Sagawa et al. 1987). The highest energy product (BH)max ~405 kJ/m3 for a sintered Nd–Fe–B magnet was reported by Sagawa et al. (1987). The composition was Nd0.15Fe0.82Be.05. Ge et al. (1998) have noted that an improved method fo r casting molten Nd–Fe–B alloy can help in making better magnets. One of the key factors is to bring down the Nd content in the alloy to as close to 27% (stoichiometric composition of Nd2Fe14B: 26.69% Nd, 72.31% Fe, 1.00% B) without at the same time precipitating the α-Fe phase. Sintered RE–Fe–B magnets with (BH)max ~320 kJ/m3 have been obtained (Kirch- mayr 1985) by using 5Ce–didymium (Nd–15% Pr–5% Ce). Many investigations (Herbst and Croat 1991) have been directed at findin g substitutions in and additions to sintered Nd–Fe–B magnets essentially to extend their useful operating temperature range. This is achievable via enhancement of Tc and Hci, decrease of the temperature coefficients of Br and Hci, and diminution of the irreversible fl ux losses accompanying high temperature exposure. Sagawa et al. (1984a) demonstrated that cobalt substitution increases Tc and decreases the temperature coefficient of Br , however, cobalt substitution is accompanied by a loss of coercivity. Partial replacemen t of Nd by Dy substantially enhances Hci and the reduces temperature coefficient of Hci, although it lowers Br somewhat. The largest room temperature coercivity ever observed in a ne odymium based sintered magnet was achieved Figure 6.25 Process steps for sintered Nd–Fe–B ma gnets with additives (Liang et al. 1998). 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 409 in (Nd0.53Dy0.47)0.15Fe0.77B0.08 by Sagawa et al. (1987a). The (BH)max was 160 kJ/m3 and Hci = 3980 kA/m. Combined Dy and Co substitution has been found to be effective in raising Tc and Hci and in decreasing the temperature coef ficient of Br and the irreversible flux losses. Other elements that have been fo und to have beneficial effects on coercivity and thermal stability are Al, Ga, and Nb. By a process described by Liang et al. (1998), Nd–Fe–B magnets with (BH)max = 334–358 kJ/m3, Hcj ≥ 1114 kA/m, Br = 1.33–1.37 T were produced starting from a magnet alloy of composition Nd9.5Pr3.4Dy0.4Tb0.4B6.1Al0.7Fe79.5. The process outline as given by them is shown in Figure 6.25. The authors, however, did not pres ent details of the “treatments” given to the magnet powder before pressing. Nd–Fe–B magnets are exemplary as regards the swift progress from the laboratory discovery to commercialization. The largest en ergy products realized so far, ~400 kJ/m3, are substantially short of (BH)max ~512 kJ/m3. Alloy modification and alternate prepa- ration methods are being explored to bridge this gap. New preparation methods include mechanical alloying (Schultz et al. 1989), hot deformation of ingots (Shimoda et al. 1988), and the hydrogenation, dispr oportionation, desorption pro cess (McGuiness et al. 1990). Super High Energy Magnets The theoretical maximum energy product (BH)max for Nd–Fe–B magnets is calculated to be 512 kJ/m3 on the basis of saturation magnetization of Nd2Fe14B single crystal (Sagawa et al. 1985). Many groups have attempted to achieve this value. In 1987 Sagawa et al. (1987) obtained, as mentioned above, 405 kJ/m3 for Nd128Fe80.7B6.5 [in wt %, 27.4 Nd–70.17 Fe–1.08 B] by controlling the oxygen content to less than 1000 ppm. In 1990, Otsuki et al. (1990) achieved a higher value of 416 kJ/m3 by a special procedure in which they added ne odymium rich alloy powder prepared by the rapid solidification technique to the alloy powder having a stoichiometric composition (Nd2Fe14B) and then sintered the powders. In 1994, Kaneko and Ishigaki (1994) succeeded in developing Nd–Fe–B sintered magnets, havi ng the highest magnetic properties of Br = 1.495 T, (BH)max = 431 kJ/m3, and Hci = 845 kA/m. The procedur e adopted by them aimed at densification of magnets up to theoretical value, increasing the volume fraction of the Nd2Fe14B (T1) phase and achieving a high degree of alignment of the T1 grains. It was carried out as follows. The alloy correspo nding to the overall composition 29.2% Nd –69.80% Fe –1.00% B (Nd13.1Fe80.9B6.0) was made by induction melting of 99.5% pure rare earth metal, 99.9% pure electrolytic iron, and ferroboron. As-cast alloys were homo- genized by heating in vacuum at 1000°C for 5 h; the cast allo ys were crushed using a jaw crusher and a disc mill to coarse powder (< 200 µm). Fine powders of about 3 µm mean particle size were then obtained by pulverizin g the coarse powder in a jet mill. The particle size distribution of the result ing powder was more uniform than those found in currently mass produced magnets. A new compacting me thod for fine powder was used to improve the degree of alignment of the T1 grains up to 95% or more. The isostatic press was carried out with three steps: (1) filling powders into a cylindrical mold in wh ich the packing density was 2000 kg/m3, (2) aligning with the pulse magnetic filed of 6400 kA/m, and finally (3) compacting by isostatic pressing at a pressu re of 200 MPa. The compacts thus obtained were sintered at about 1060 ~ 1080°C for 3 h in an argon atmosphere and were subsequently annealed at about 50 0–600°C for 1 h, also in argon. The mean particle size measured by a Fish er subsieve sizer is the same, i.e., 3 µm for the alloy powders obtained by Kaneko and Is higashi (1994) and for the commercially used alloy powders. Particle size distribution of the former, however, is more uniform, and, as a result, the microstructure of the sintered ma gnet obtained under the improved pulverizing conditions became finer and the grain si ze became smaller, than under conventional 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 410 conditions. This finer microstructu re results in an increase of Hci. The degree of alignment of T1 grains improves with the strength of th e pulse magnetic field and exceeds 95% for a magnetic field of 6400 kA/m. The improvement of Br and (BH)max in the new magnets is due to the high degree of orientation of T1 crystals. Kaneko and Ishigaki (1994) state that the making of a super high energy product mag- net is dependent upon controlling the chemical composition, increasing the volume fraction of the Nd2Fe14B matrix phase, improving particle size distribution, and adopting the iso- static pressing method to get better alignment of fine particles. The highest grade sintered Nd magnets in large-scale production have an energy product of 320 kJ/m3 and the coercivity is also insuffici ent. To be able to obtain a higher residual magnetization (Br), iron rich composition close to a 2–14–1 compound is necessary. There are, however, difficulties in achieving this comp osition at production level. The problems are powder oxidation and a decrease in Br. The Nd–Fe–B alloys in the form of fine powders with diameters of 3 to 4 µm easily oxidize in air to form Nd2O3. The oxygen content in sintered Nd magnets ra nges from 0.5 to 0.7%. Oxidation consumes neodymium and the nonmagnetic Nd2O3 lowers the magnetic property of the material. In sintered Nd–Fe–B magnets, additions used to increase coercivity decrease residual magnetization. To obtain a high performan ce Nd magnet, a balance between oxidation protection and decreased use of additives is necessary. The poor corrosion resistance of sintered Nd magnets necessitates the use of coating for actual use. Honshima and Ohashi (1994) have developed a two alloy method fo r producing sintered neodymium iron boron magnets. Their method addresses the twin problems of oxidation resistance and minimum use of additives. Two alloy process The process flowsheet of the two-alloy method of Honshima and Ohashi (1994) is shown in Figure 6.26. Th is is a powder metallurgy procedure that used two alloys as starting material. One alloy, the main alloy, had a composition closely approximating the 2–14–1 compound, and the ot her alloy, called the suballoy, had a com- position rich in rare earth elements and c obalt. The main alloy was responsible for the intrinsic magnetic properties. The suballoy wa s a sintering aid and was responsible for the densification of the sintered body and the cleaning of sintered particle grain boundaries during the sintering process. The two alloys were melted and cast i ndividually and crushed to 200 µm size. After the coarse pulverization, th ey were mixed and processed further. In the present process, the pressing of fine powder in a homogeneous magnetic field was accomplished in air. The main alloy composition was Nd12.3Fe81.8B5.9. In the as-cast alloy, a large amount of primary iron exists and a solid solution heat treatment was necessary to obtain the single 2–14–1 phase. The suballoy was rich in cobalt and this improved the corrosion resistance of the fine powder and the sintered body. Dysprosium, praseodymium, and gallium added via the suballoy enhanced coercivity. The main and suballoys mixing ratio was approximately 90:10, and after sintering the final composition of the magnet was Nd11.3Pr1.6Dy0.8Fe76.9Co3.1B5.9Ga0.3. The magnet produced by the two alloy meth od was superior to that produced by the conventional (one alloy) method. Using the two alloy method, sintered Nd magnets with energy products of 360 kJ/m3 and moderate coercivity were mass produced. The oxidation stability of fine powder of two alloy magnets was excellent. For example, after exposure ofthe powder to air at 24°C and 40% relative humidity for 3 days, the coercive force of the sintered magnet produced by the two al loy method remained almost constant. In contrast, even after one day of exposure, the co ercive force of the sintered magnet produced06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 411 conventionally decreased considerably (to less than half of the original value). The low oxidation level of the fine powder is attrib uted to cobalt base compounds. The two alloy method thus allows the fine powder to be handled in air during the pressing process, obviating the need for special processing under vacuum or inert gas. The method is therefore attractive for use in mass production. The two alloy method also resulted in less oxygen in the sintered body and improved it s corrosion resistance. The cobalt addition to the 2–14–1 alloy suppressed oxidation further. Improved magnetic properties of the two allo y product were attributed primarily to the dysprosium distribution and partially to pr aseodymium distribution. Even though dys- prosium increased coercivity, it decreased saturation magnetization. In the processing method described, however, dysprosium was di stributed mainly near the grain boundaries of the sintered 2–14–1 particles. Its presen ce near grain boundaries increased coercivity and its absence in the center region reduced the decrease in saturatio n magnetization, thus yielding a high performance Nd magnet. Even though fine powder oxidation and co rrosion resistance of the sintered magnet body were improved by the two alloy proce ss, the improvement in corrosion resistance was not sufficient. Thus, like in the case of conv entional sintered Nd magnets, a coating was necessary for corrosion protection (Minowa et al. 1989). An electroless copper layer, which has good contact with the Nd magnet was firs t provided, and over this copper underlayer an electroless nickel upper layer was provided. The total thickness was about 10 µm. While coating adhesion was ensured by the copper underlayer, the electroless plating method ensured that film thickness was uniform throughout, including the magnet edges (Honshima and Ohashi 1994). Figure 6.26 Flowsheet of the two alloy method for making Nd–Fe–B magnets (Honshimo and Ohashi 1994). 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 412 6.10 Sm –Fe–N MAGNETS In addition to the well-known Sm–Co and Nd–Fe–B series of magnets, several other RE–TM magnets have been evaluated for th eir attractive magnetic properties. These include Tb–Fe–Co and Sm–Fe–N magnets. The properties of bonded Sm–Fe–N (Ohmori1998) are shown in Figure 6.27. The Sm–Fe a lloy has been prepared by reduction diffusion and the bonded magnet has been made by in jection molding. The production process followed at Sumitomo is s hown in Figure 6.28. 6.11 NANOCOMPOSITE PERMANENT MAGNET MATERIALS A new type of magnet material described as nanocomposite permanent magnetic materials consisting of exchange coupled hard and soft magnetic phases (exchange spring magnets) has been attracting attention, particularly b ecause of their low temperature coefficients of Br and Hcj (Coehoorn et al. 1989, Chang and Hsing 1996). Nanocomposite magnets have been synthesized by melt spinning, mech anical alloying, and milling (Guo et al. 1998). 6.12 TERFENOL-D Investigations carried out in the mid-1960s on the magnetic properties of pure rare earth metals revealed that some of them exhib ited large magnetostriction at low temperatures (Clark 1979). When a magnetic field is appl ied to a magnetostrictive material, it will expand or contract. Similarly, when stress is applied to the material, a magnetic pulse is generated. In 1971 Clark and Belson (1972) from the Naval Ordnance Laboratory Figure 6.27 Comparison between injection molded Sm–Fe–N and other bonded magnets (Ohmori 1998). 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 413 announced that TbFe2 exhibited magnetically induced st rains at room temperature that were larger, by a factor of ten, than that of any other magnetostricti ve materials like Ni, ferrites, known until then. This was almost simultaneously confirmed by Koon et al. (1971). Much of the work on developi ng the optimum properties of the TbFe2 materials was carried out by Clark and coworkers at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory and the materi- als were named “terfenol” after ter bium–iron (Fe ) and the initials of the N aval O rdnance Laboratory. It was subsequently foun d that dysprosium added to the TbFe2 compound allowed the use of lower magnetic fields to produce the strain, but this led to some degradation in the total strain. The optimum composition arrived at was Tb0.3Dy0.7Fe1.9, and this is now known as “terfenol-D.” Terfe nol-D exhibits giant magnetostriction in an applied field, ~100 times larger than in nickel. Schmidt et al. (1986) prepared terfenol-D by a thermit reduction process. Appropriate amounts of TbF3, DyF3, and FeF3 plus 10% excess calcium were mixed together and loaded into a heavy walled iron crucible lined with CaF2. The crucible was closed and the reaction was triggered electrically using a hot iron filament. The exothermic reaction pro-ceeded quickly, and with the alloy and slag fo rming immiscible liquids they settled giving terfenol-D, which was well separated from the CaF 2 slag on cooling. The yield of terfenol-D was 94%. This method is a le ss expensive alternative to the conventional method of preparation of the material by arc melting. In arc melting, the high purity metals , Fe–99.98%, Dy–99.97%, and Tb–99.97% were alloyed together. Initial alloying by ar c melting in a water-cooled copper hearth is followed by several meltings to prep are homogeneous alloy (Verhoeven 1987). Experiments on the growing terfenol-D crysta ls and directionally solidified polycrys- talline materials were carried out at the Am es Laboratory by McMasters et al. (1986). To achieve the optimum magnetostrictive characteris tics, attempts were directed to obtain (1) single crystals oriented with 〈111〉 along the crystal axis, (2) a minimum amount of defect structure and impurity content, and (3) a co nstant stoichiometry along the crystal axis. Terfenol-D has many applications in sensor and control devices in industry.

Magnetic refrigerators have been considered more efficient than most cryogenic cooling systems particularly belo w liquid nitrogen temperature (Anonymous 1989). The magnetic refrigerant rotates through a magnetic field, and while doing so warms or cools itself. As the refrigerant enters the ma gnetic field, it warms up and when it leaves the magnetic field it cools down. This behavior permits heat exchange and cooling of a gas or a system. The gadolinium refrigerant, fo r example, is rotated at ~5 rpm. The refrigerator using the magnetic refrigera nt is called the active magnetic regene- rative (AMR) magnetic refrigerator (MR) (Gschneidner et al. 1994a). A current design of the AMR–MR refrigerator for the liquefactio n of hydrogen gas is based on a modified Joule–Brayton cycle and uses GdPd as the act ive component for the low temperature range. The problems associated with GdPd are the co st of Pd and the ductility of the compound, which makes crushing the intermetallic to a fi ne powder difficult. The refrigerant in the form of a fine powder is necessary for effici ent heat transfer during various heating and cooling cycles. The intermetallic (Dy0.5Er0.5)Al2 is not only cheaper and more brittle than GdPd but also has a much larger (30% mo re than GdPd) magnetocaloric effect. It is an excellent re- placement for GdPd (Gschneidner et al. 1994a). The magnetocaloric effect of TbNi2 is also 15% larger than GdPd (Gschneidner et al. 1994). For attaining extremely low temperatur es, the intermetallic compound PrNi5 has been used as the key material in an adiabatic de magnetization refrigerator, in conjunction with the nuclear magnetic cooling of copper (Gschneidn er et al. 1995). In the two-stage adiabatic demagnetization unit, PrNi5 was used as the first stage and copper as the second stage. In the presence of two magnetic fields, one around the PrNi5 stage and the second around the copper, the entire unit was cooled down by a dilution refrigerator to ~25 mK. Then as the ~6 T field was slowly removed from the PrNi5 stage, the entire unit cooled down to ~5 mK. Figure 6.29 Schematic diagram of the rotating disc atomizer. Cross section of the quench bath. Position 1 indicates the atomization skull, 2 a particle before contacting the quenchant, and 3 a particle before contacting th e container (Osborne et al. 1993). 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 415 A temperature of ~30 µK could then be reached when the field around copper in the second stage was reduced. The preparation of magnetic refrigeration materials is usually accomplished by arc melting 99.8 at % pure rare earth metals and >99.99% pure nickel or aluminum in correct proportions on a water-cooled copper hearth (Gschneidner et al. 1994). When more than one rare earth metal was in the alloy, the rare earths were melted first, and then in the second step the non-rare earth metal comp onent was melted in. The methods described earlier for rare earth intermetallics and metals or the atomization technique described below for making cryogenic cooler materials co uld be used for powder preparation. Cryogenic coolers used for applications in present and emerging technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging, Josephson circ uitry, and magnetic levitation utilize packed bed heat exchangers for transferring heat from a load to a sink. The packed beds are com- posed of rare earth–metal compounds (RExMy) such as Er3Ni, DyCo, and (Er0.9Yb0.1)Ni or pure rare earth metals such as Nd. The diam eter of the particles used in the packed beds is ~200 µm. Osborne et al. (1993) have used centrifugal atomization with a rotating disk to produce high quality spherical particles of RExMy compounds and pure metals. In the process used by Osborne et al. (1993) for the preparation of Er3Ni powder, the starting Er3Ni compound was first prepared. Stoichiometric amounts of Er and Ni were alloyed by arc melting in a wate r cooled copper hearth. The Er3Ni intermetallic thus obtained contained 89.5% Er, 10.5% Ni, 45 ppm O, 4 ppm N, and 18 ppm C. Alumina crucibles were used to contain molten Er3Ni prior to atomizing. The alumina crucible had a 3.2 mm hole drilled in it for bottom pouring. The charge (Er3Ni) was melted under UHP (ultra high pure) Ar atmosphere, h eated to 50–100°C above the melting point, held for 5 min for complete homogenization and then poured onto a rotating 50 mm diameter atomization disk made of low densit y alumina with an erosion resistant coating. A schematic of the system is shown in Figure 6.29. The atomized particles were quenched in a 2 liter volume of a low viscosity (100 cen tistokes) silicone oil. The oil was held in a container and the container was also rotating concentrically at a lower rpm, in the same direction as the atomization disk. The oil was preheated to 170°C in air to improve dehyd- ration of the quenchant. The particles were collected from the quench ant by filtration. They were cleaned with heptane and methyl alcohol. Even though the pu rity of the powder obtained was high and its shape was spherical, Osborne et al. (1993) did not consider the particle shape optimal. In the ideal case, the superheat must be so hi gh that the particles have time to respherodize in the quenchant, yet low enough that complete solidification occurs before contacting the container wall. Particles of Nd metal were also prepared by a similar technique. The important difference was that in place of alumina as cont ainer, tantalum was used and prior to use it was baked at 1300°C for 8 h under 10–4 Pa. Prior to the development of the centrifug al atomization technique for making ErNi5 powder, the Ames group (Anderson et al. 1993) had investigated a high pressure gas atomization approach (HPGA) to produce un iform spherical powders of high purity ErNi3. The system used is shown in Figure 6.30. The starting ErNi3 alloy was prepared by arc melting weighed amount of Er and Ni in a water cooled copper hearth. The major impuriti es in Er (at ppm) were H 828, C 97, N 60, O 546, F 246, Cl 14, and Fe 19 (all the re maining impurities <10 at. ppm and most <1 at. ppm), and the major impurities in Ni in ppm atomic were H-330, C-580, O-107, Cl-1, andMn-2 (all the remaining im purities were <1 at. ppm).06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 416 The HPGA system consisted of a melting system with a high purity (99.55%) con- trolled porosity (21.0% porosity) alumina crucib le, a high purity (99.8%) hard fired alumina stopper rod, and a boron nitrid e (93% BN) pour tube. The Er3Ni alloy was heated to 1100°C (about 200°C above the estimated liquidus temperature of Er3Ni) to promote effective alloy homogenization and atomization. The melting and atomization chamber, shown in Figure 6.30, had been evacuated to 6 Pa and backfi lled with UHP (99.998%) argon to a positive pressure of 110 kPa prior to melting and atom ization operations. A gas pressure of 3 MPa with UHP Ar was used to operate the atomi zation nozzle. The melt tip configuration used promoted production of large (0.15 to 0. 35 mm) powder particles. Besides, an in situ passiv- ation process was used during the atomization of the powder to condition it against atmos- pheric degradation. The atomizer yielded both spherical powder s and flattened splat flakes, and they were separated using a fluidized bed sorter. Uniform spherical powders of Er3Ni, between 0.15 and 0.35 mm in diameter, were obtained, af ter sorting. The nominal alloy composition of the Er3Ni charge remained unchanged in th e resulting powder. In the as-atomized (unsorted) powder the contents of gaseous im purities were 63 ppm H, 67 ppm N, and 2600 ppm O. Anderson et al. (1993) attributed the high oxygen content to the formation of splat flakes, which have a large surface to volume ratio. A fairly large fraction of as-atomized powder yield (~10 to 20%) consisted of sp lat flakes. The average yield of high quality spherical powders was only about 16% of the initial atomizer charge weight. Other techniques for obtaining rare earth metals and intermetallic compounds in powder form are (1) mechanical grinding of cast ingots into powder, (2) spark erosion and (3) rotating electrode pressing. These techniques have one or more limitations relating to Figure 6.30 Schematic diagram of the high pressure gas atomization (HPGA) apparatus at Ames. Inset sketches the nozzle/pour tube configuration (Anderson et al. 1993). 06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 417 powder shape, purity and co mposition. Among all the techniques, centrifugal and high pressure gas atomization procedures appear better. 6.14 THIN FILM DEPOSITION PROCESSES For many applications rare earth-bearing materi als are required in the form of a thin film deposited on a suitable substrate. The techniqu es used for the preparation of bubble domain memory materials and magnetooptic storag e media illustrate the techniques used. 6.14.1 Bubble Domain Memory Materials In 1970, Bobeck et al. (1970) discovered that many rare earth garnet crystals grown from fluxes possess sufficient unaxial anisotropy to maintain bubble domain stability. Sub- sequently it was shown that films of magnetic garnets could be readily deposited by liquid phase epitaxy from molten PbO–B2O3 solutions on to gadolinium gallium garnet, Gd3Ga5O12, (GGG) substrates. A large number of s ubstrates, 30 at a time, can be simulta- neously dipped into the melt under near isothe rmal conditions at temperatures ranging from 750°C to 1100°C, and melt comp ositions can be adjusted to yield garnet films of required specifications. The substrate GG G is prepared as follows. The GGG melts congruently at 1740°C and is grown by the well-known Czochralski or pulling technique. Crystals are grown fro m melts contained in indium crucibles in an atmosphere of nitrogen containing 2% O2 (Brandle and Valentino 1972, Brandle et al. 1972). Large crystals of GGG, 75 mm diameter and weighing up to 75 g, are grown routine- ly (Nielsen 1981). The crystals are sewed, lapped, and polished to prepare substrates onto which the magnetic garnet films are deposited. 6.14.2 Magnetooptic Storage Media Magnetooptic storage media (Buschow 1988, Kryder 1993) consist of a thin film of magnetic material deposited on a transparent su bstrate, usually glass or plastic. The thin film is made in such a way that it is energetically most favorable for the magnetization to lie perpendicular to the plane. The most co mmon magnetooptic storage media consist of amorphous alloys of the rare earth elements gadolinium and terbium and the transitionmetal elements iron and cobalt. The amorphous alloys, e.g., Tb 25(Fe0.9Co0.1)75, are depo- sited onto substrates by some form of sputtering process (to a thickness of 500 µ). A sputtering system typically consists of a vacuum chamber in which a target and the substrates to be coated are located. The targ et consists of the magnetic material to be deposited onto the substrates. The target is biased with a strong negative voltage (about 1000 V) relative to the ground potential of the vacuum chamber itself. When an inert gas, such as argon, is leaked into the chamber at a low pressure, the large voltage potential in the system causes the electrons to be stripped from the argon atoms and a plasma is formed. Then the positive argon ions are accelerated to ward the negatively biased target and strike it with high energy. The ensuing transfer of momentum from the argon ions causes atoms or clusters of atoms of the target material to be sputtered away from the target. These sputtered atoms diffuse away from the target. If a substrate is in cl ose proximity to the target, it gets coated with a th in film of the target material.06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 418 The rare earth transition metal thin films deposited by such a sputtering method are typically amorphous. This fact has proved to be important to their performance as low noise recording media. In spite of their amorphous st ructure, the rare earths transition metal thin films exhibit anisotropic properties such that the lowest energy orientation for magneti- zation is perpendicular to the film plane. This is necessary for a good magnetooptic storage medium. Rare earth transition metal alloys are pron e to corrosion and must be protected from the environment. This is done in magnetoopt ic media by using a thin dielectric that is impervious to both water vapor and oxygen , between the substrate and magnetic film. Suitable materials are Si3N4 or AlN. The top surface of th e film is protected by a similar dielectric and a reflective metal overcoat, such as aluminum. The rare earth transition metal media manufactured this way have design lifetimes of over 10 years. The rare earth transition metal thin films us ed as storage medium in modern magneto- optic disks include GdTbFe and TbFeCo with the total rare earth content of about 20%. 6.15 LaNi5 The hydrogen absorption characteristics of LaNi5 type compounds were first revealed by Zijlstra and Westerdorp (1969) and elab orated further by Van Vucht et al. (1970) at the Philips Research Laboratories in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. LaNi5 behaves like a hydrogen sponge. When hydrogen is introd uced into a finely divided alloy of LaNi5, it will be absorbed resulting in the form ation of lanthanum nickel hydride LaNi5 + 3H2 = LaNi5H6 The absorption reaction is exothermic, and th is will limit the reaction rate at a fixed H2 pressure if heat is not removed. When h eat is removed the hydrogen adsorption rate remains high, and the quantity that could be absorbed is remarkable. Because the hydrogen is actually chemically bound within the hydri de crystal lattice, when fully loaded, LaNi5H6 has a volumetric density of hydrogen that is si gnificantly greater than even liquid hydrogen. LaNi5 hydride is more attractive as a hydrogen storage system than many alternatives because (1) it operates at ambient temperature, (2) it stores H2 at low pressure, comparable to liquid, (3) it is comparable in weight efficiency to compressed gas, and (iv) it is comparable in volumetric efficiency to cr yogenic liquid. The only disadvantage of LaNi5 is the high cost, compared to, for example, FeTi. In the LaNi5–H system, the hysteresis of the ad sorption–desorption cycle is small. Like adsorption, the desorption kinetics is al so fast. There is a 25% increase in volume in LaNi5 on full hydrogen loading. Desorption at a comfortable rate can be accomplished at temperatures around 150°C. For an actual application the LaNi5 alloy was prepared by arc melting to the proper stoichiometry from lanthanum and nickel charge metals of at least 99.5% purity (Lundin 1973). The arc-melted alloy ingot was broken to granule size in a hardened steel mortar and pestle. The grinding operation could be cond ucted in air. The size of the granules was approximately 0.75 to 3 mm. As regards hydrogen adsorption–desorpt ion, the behavior of (La, Ce) Ni5 and MMNi5 alloys is basically similar to that of LaNi5.06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 419 Genshi et al. (1985) prepared MMNi5 compound by chemical synthesis. The chlorides of Ni(NiCl2) and MM(MMCl3) were dissolved in water and then precipitated as MM2(CO3)2.5Ni2(OH)2.CO3.xH2O. The precipitate was dried and heated under H2 at about 750°C to reduce Ni2+ to Ni and obtain misch metal carbonate–nickel mixture. This powder was reduced with Ca at 1000°C to yield misch metal nickel intermetallic compounds. One of the problems with the use of rare earth–nickel hydride forming materials is pulverization of alloys into a very fine powder upon repetitive hydriding–dehydriding cycles and very poor thermal conductivity of the powdered alloys. To prevent such disintegration and also improve ther mal conductivity, Ishikawa et al. (1985) proposed a microcapsulation method. In this method, fine particles of hydride forming alloys such as LaNi5 and MMNi4.5Mn0.5 were coated with a thin layer of metallic copper by a chemical plating method. Hydrogen storag e capacities of alloys were no t appreciably affected due to the plating. The encapsulated alloy powders was easily pressed into pellets. The pellets had high thermal conductivity and sufficient porosity to permea te hydrogen leading to fast reaction kinetics. The encapsulation is done as follows. As-cast LaNi5 and MMNi4.5Mn0.5 were crushed and then pu lverized by repeating the hydrogen adsorption–desorption cycle up to 10 times. After the fina l dehydrogenation, the powders were ground and screened to 20 µm average particle size, in air. The surfaces of alloy particles were activated by treating with the aqueous SnCl2 and HCl solution and then with PdCl2 + HCl aqueous solution. The powder s were then immersed in the Cu2+–tartaric acid complex + CH2O + NaOH aqueous solution to form a metallic copper layer of ~ 1 µm thick. The coated alloy powders were pressed into pellets at 100 MPa at room temperature. The encapsulated alloy powder in the pellet s was easily reactivated by evacuating and then heating at ~100°C under 10 atm hydrogen pr essure. The encapsulated particles were able to withstand more than 5000 repeated hydrid ing–dehydriding cycles without disintegrating. 6.16 SUPERCONDUCTORS Superconductivity was discovered in 1911 by Kammerlingh Onnes who showed that mercury loses all of its electrical resistan ce (becomes superconducting) when cooled to liquid helium temperature (4 K). Between that time and 1986 a variety of materials werefound to be superconducting, but the highest known critical temperature, T c, was 23.3 K for Nb3Ge. The critical temperature is the upper lim it of the temperature range in which the material is still superconducting. The criti cal current and critical magnetic field are similarly defined because superconductivity is destroyed by too much current and too great a field, and these three critical variables characterize the superconductor. It is techno-logically and commercially advantageous to ha ve materials that have high critical values. In 1986 a new group of materials known as high temperature superconductors was discovered by Bednorz and Mueller. They (B ednorz and Mueller 1986) originally reported work on a multiphase Ba–La–Cu–O compound with a T c below 30 K. As work continued in several groups, it was rev ealed that the superconducting phase had a perovskite-like structure and that the Tc could be pushed up to 40 K by replacing barium ions in the compound with strontium. The widely accep ted BCS (Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer) theory of superconductivity ha d predicted a maximum possible Tc of about 40 K. As shown in Figure 6.31 this limit as well as the liqu id nitrogen temperature of 77 K was quickly06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 420 crossed with the discovery of newer ceram ic superconducting compounds (Fox 1996, Fisher 1988, Alford 1992). Mo st significant of these was th e discovery in February 1987 by Chu’s group at Houston that a multi phase Y–Ba–Cu–O compound (YBCO) had a Tc of 92 K. It was subsequently shown that th e YBCO phase responsible for superconductivity was perovskite-like with a composition of Y1Ba2Cu3O7–x (commonly referred to as the 1–2–3 phase). The Ginzburg and Landau (known as GL) theory explains many features of high temperature superconductivity. One conclusion from the GL theory, particularly relevant to the processing of superconductors, is that all high Tc superconductors, already discovered and yet to be discovered, should have very short coherence lengths of typically atomic scale dimensions. Coherence length is the distance over which paired electrons (carrying supercurrent) interact. In high temp erature superconductors, the coherence length is about 1–3 nm, which is less than th at for a conventional superconductor. Figure 6.31 Development of high temperature superconducting alloys.06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 421 The very short coherence length of the electron pair in all high– Tc superconductors implies that, in polycrystalline material, gr ain boundaries must be sharp and contain no amorphous phases. If the grain boundary widt h exceeds coherence length the electron pairs will be strongly scattered. Generally, the cr ystalline defects, other than those that pin fluxoids without scattering electron pairs, must be minimized. The coherence length is comparable with the spacings of the copper –oxygen layers in YBCO. Thus the critical current in a direction perpendicular to these la yers will be low. This is confirmed in that high Jc is obtained in directions parallel to a–b planes but not parallel to the c-axis. Texturing, therefore, becomes essential to ob tain high critical current densities in poly- crystalline materials. Besides, to obtain cer amic superconductors with sufficient strength for winding, for example, into coils and to withstand the Lorentz force originating from a high current in a high magnetic field, the size of pores and cracks must be minimized. In YBa2Cu3O7–x, the highest critical density is achieved when x = 0, but the material remains superconducting down to YBa2Ca3O6.5. In the production of bulk YBa2Cu3O7, the tetragonal phase YBa2Cu3O6 is formed first and then ann ealed in oxygen to produce the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transformation to YBa2Cu3O7. These are three main techniques for making high- Tc superconductors. In the first, the materials can be deposited onto a single crys tal structure by methods such as evaporation, laser ablation, or sputtering so that epitaxia l growth occurs. In the second, thick films can be made by mixing the powder with various polymers and solvents and applying it to a suitable polycrystalline cerami c or metallic substrate. In the third method, bulk materials can be made by sintering a powder of right stoichiometry, for example, Y2O3, BaCO3, and CuO mixed in the molar proportions 1:2:3. The fracture toughne ss of superconducting ceramics is so low that making bulk ceramics in complex shapes requires rather sophisti- cated processing techniques. Thin films of high- Tc superconductors are produced b ecause they have major potential application in electronic devices, and for basic scientific measurements single crystal thin films are relatively easy to grow. The best su perconducting thin films have been obtained by growing them epitaxially on substrates closely lattice matched to the superconductor. As regards methods for produci ng the thin films, if Y1Ba2Cu3O7 is used as a target, it can be sputter deposited onto a substrate held at about 400°C. The YBCO layer will be oxygen deficient and in amorphous or polycrystall ine form. Subsequent annealing in oxygen results in epitaxial growth that nucleates at the substrate–film interface. Alternatively, the materials can be directly sputtered onto a si ngle crystal substrate held at 650°C. A tetra- gonal epitaxial film of approximate composition YBa2Cu3O6 is formed and oxygen annealing leads to orthorhombic superconducting YBa2Cu3O7–x. Thin film deposition can also be done by laser ablation, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), and metallorganic molecular beam epitaxy (MOMBE). Thin film (0.5 µm) superconductors are capable of carrying large amounts of current (10 million amps per cm2), but they are not suitable for many pr actical applications because of their fragility. Bending of the thin film material can damage the YBCO grain structure and mis- alignment in the grain structure, hampers the flow of current. Thick film tapes (1–2 µm thickness) conduct one million amps per cm2 and can retain half of their current carrying ability in magnetic fields as high as nine tesla. In a process developed in 1995 at the Superconductivity T echnology Center of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a three-layer tape made of YBCO compound and zirconium oxide placed in a pliable nickel alloy tape was made. The zircon ium oxide layer prevents interaction between the YBCO compound and nickel and also forces the YBCO into a regular crystalline order06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 422 that promotes superconductivity. Ion beam deposition is used to apply the zirconium dioxide layer. One beam of ions lays down a few hundred thousandths of an inch of zircon- ium oxide, while the second beam orients the cr ystals as they form on nickel. This results in an orderly symmetrical surface on wh ich the YBCO layer can be affixed. By pulsed layer deposition of thick films (6–10 µm) of Y-123, researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory have reported Jc values greater than 1 MA/cm2 at 77 K (Foltyn et al. 1993). This potentially scaleable tech nique may be used to prepare superconductor coated continuously on long lengths of meta l or ceramic substrates with suitable buffer layers. Bulk superconducting YBaCuO can be made by sintering Y2O3, CuO, and BaO and annealing in oxygen. However, careful control is needed in the annealing temperature and cooling rate, in reducing the particle size, and in eliminating impurities. It is then possible to produce a material that is 99% pure superconducting Y1Ba2Cu3O7–x, having 99% of grain boundaries atomically sharp with no traces of impurities. Critical current values in the pure polycrystalline materials typically exceed 107 Am–2. To obtain YBa2Cu3O7–x that has sufficient strength to be fabricated into wires and coils, the density must be above 85% and the la rger the better, and crack size should be less than 10 µm. The critical current density increases with an increase in the density of the material. In addition to good mechanical proper ties, high density materials also have longer life and do not degrade. Typically, the density of a sintered body can be increased by raising the sintering temperature. In the Y-123 system, if special precautions such as vacuum calcination are not taken during powder preparation, often a low melting (~900°C) Ba–Cu–O liquid forms. While sintering above this temperature leads to more rapid liquid phase sintering resulting in improved density and increased grain size, it also results in an insulating phase along the grain boundaries thereby decreasing the critical current density (McGinn 1994). To obtain bulk superconductor w ith good mechanical properties, high purity starting material in the form of submicrometer powder is essential (Masur et al. 1994). Using viscous processing routes, coils and shapes can then be fabricated. To achieve high current densities in polycr ystalline wires and thick films of ceramic superconductors, texturing is essential. Textur ing or texture processing leads to improved Jc in polycrystalline Y-123 by avoiding or minimizing many of the weak link limitations to Jc. Some of the primary causes of weak link behavior can be minimized by having a micro- structure where the current flow is directed primarily in the basal plane and by minimizing the occurrence of high angle grain boundaries. In bulk Y-123, formation of texture has been achieved by a number of different techniqu es, including compaction processes, magnetic alignment of particles, and directional solidification of particles. Transport Jc values exceeding 10 kA/cm2 in applied fields of several tesla have been achieved by solidification routes described by the term “melt texturing” (Jin et al. 1988, 1989). In the case of Y-123, melt texturing describes directional solidifi cation from the melt or partially melted state. Texturing is achieved in various ways such as melt texturing, rolling, and solidification in high magnetic fields. A process known as the metallic precursor (MP) approach has been used to prepare long lengths of high Tc ceramic superconducting wires (Sandhage et al. 1990). The MP approach is particularly attractive for fabrica tion of high filament count, fine filamentary composite conductors because mo st of the wire-forming process is performed while the material is in its metallic state. In the process described by Masur et al. (1994) of the American Superconductor Corporation, high filament count silve r-sheathed composite06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 423 wires of YBa2Cu4O8 were prepared. The process starts with the preparation of homo- geneous alloy powder by mechanical alloying of the metallic elements. The alloy powder is packed into a silver can that is sealed and extruded into a hexagonal rod. Cut pieces of the rod are stacked into a multi rod bundle that is again packed into a can and extruded into a hexagonal rod. This process is repeated many times. In the final step, the can is extruded with a reduction ratio of up to 300:1 into a rectangular tape or round wire. The extruded metal tapes were internally oxidized to fo rm silver–suboxide composites. The suboxides consisted of Y2O3, BaO, CuO and Ba2Cu3Ox. They were then reacted to form the Y-124 phase. The finely divided suboxides that fo rm from the oxidation process react quickly to form Y-124 even at ambient oxygen pressure . Following oxidation, the tapes were subjected to thermomechanical treatments (TMT) to co nvert the suboxides into textured poly- crystalline Y-124 grains. The TMT involved mu ltiple iterations of heat treatment in the range of 600–825°C followed by uniaxial pressi ngs of up to 2 GPa and a final heat treatment at 750°C for 100 h in 1 atm of oxygen. Ta pes containing up to 962,407 filaments with filament dimensions as fine as 0.25 µm thick and 1 µm wide with significant biaxial crystal- lographic texture were thus made. These wires exhibited transport current densities in the oxide filament of 69,500 A/cm2 at 4.2 K in self-field with decreased weak link behavior in applied field, better critical current retention during binding, and in general some of the bestproperties for a polycrystalline, sintered wi re of YBCO in an applied magnetic field. 6.17 SUMMARY There are numerous rare earth-containing en d-product materials suitable for commercial applications or research uses. Many of thes e are compounds, alloys, and metals that are produced either as end products of ore proces sing or as interprocess intermediates in the preparation of rare earth metals. Many rare earth materials, however, have to be producedspecifically starting from interprocess intermediates or metals. These processes have beencovered in this chapter. The first commercial rare earth material was the gas mantle produced by Carl Auer von Welsbach. The production method was me ntioned in Chapter 1. To light the gas mantles, a lighter flint based on misch metal was also invented by Welsbach. As early as 1908, he used fused salt electrolysis of mixed rare earth chloride as the method to obtain misch metal. This method to date remains the most important process for misch metal pro-duction. In the U.S. and Japan, the USBM pr ocess of oxide–fluoride electrolysis has also been adopted for commercial production of misch metal. Thermal reduction processesbased on calcium reduction of mixed rare earth fluoride have been investigated in Brussels and at Ames. The addition of rare earths to steel results in several advantages. Rare earths are added in the form of misch metal or as rare earth–iron–silicon–iron alloys. The rare earth–iron–silicon alloys are commercially prepared by a carbothermic reduction of a mixture of rare earth compounds or ore concentr ate, iron or iron ore, and si lica in a submerged electric arc furnace. Many other processes that result in hi gher rare earth loading in the alloy and better rare earth recovery have also been develope d. These include the USBM process in which a mixed rare earth oxide of bastnasite origin was reduced by calcium silicide, ferrosilicon, silicon, and aluminum, and the BARC proces s in which a mixed rare earth oxide of monazite origin was reduced with ferrosilicon and aluminum scrap. In the Chinese practice,06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 424 rare earth-containing blast furnace slag from Baotou was reduced with ferrosilicon using lime as flux in an arc furnace. Electric ar c furnace reductions have also been used to produce rare-earth–magnesium–silicon alloy starting from rare earth containing blast furnace slag, calcined dolomite–ferrosilicon, calcium, and silicon. Electrolytic processes have been used to prepare rare earth–aluminum–zinc and yttrium–aluminum alloys. Rare earth transition metal-based magnets are a family of commercial products of considerable variety and constantly growing major technical importance. The first group of rare earth magnets developed in the 1960s and 1970s were based on the intermetallic compounds RECo5 and RE2Co17. These compounds possess an ideal combination of magnetic and structural properties for high performance magnet applications. They were prepared by the simple technique of direct melting of alloy components or by using more sophisticated methods such as co-reduction or reduction diffusion using metal oxides as start materials. The technique of direct producti on of alloy by fused salt electrolysis using cobalt as consumable anode was also used. Th e alloys were ground to a powder, mixed with a chemical binder, and pressed under a magn etizing field to produce the plastic-bonded magnets. The adoption of inexpensive moldin g methods such as ex trusion and injection molding in an orienting field facilitated larg e-scale production and industrial application of the bonded rare earth permanent magnets. Inst ead of plastic, a soft metal matrix has also been used as the binder and metal matrix bon ded magnets have better elevated temperature stability. Sintered magnets were prepared by following the sequence of blending, milling, aligning and pressing, sintering, and finally a post-sintering heat treatment. As regards the magnetic properties the sintered magnets are superior, but bonded magnets also have numerous practical advantages. Cost and supply problems of samarium an d cobalt were serious disadvantages of the samarium–cobalt magnets, and the search fo r suitable alternatives culminated in the development of neodymium–iron–boron magnets in the 1980s. Like in the case of the samarium cobalt, the overall process for th e production of Nd–Fe–B magnets comprises two major stages. One is the production of ma gnetic alloy, and the other is the processing of the Nd–Fe–B type alloys into permanent magnets. Many methods have been developed for the production of Nd–Fe–B alloys. They include direct melting, co-reduction, and cer tain special techniques that make use of reduction extraction or thermit type processe s for directly making the Nd–Fe or Nd–Fe–B alloys. The alloys are converted to magnets by two basically distinct routes. One route involves the rapid solidification technique of melt spinning and the other follows the traditional pressing and sintering route. Th e melt spinning procedure involves ejection of molten Nd–Fe–B alloy through a crucible orif ice onto the surface of a spinning substrate disc. The product so obtained is in the form of ribbons typically 30–50 µm thick, 1–3 mm wide. The melt-spun ribbons are consolidated in to a dense form to produce either a bonded magnet or a hot pressed magnet. Fine tuning of magnetic properties to desired values is also achieved by doping the magnet alloy with elem ents such as niobium, zirconium, and many others. The “sintered Nd–Fe–B magnets” are prepared starting from finely divided alloy powders obtained from pulverizing of cast ingots or directly reduced powders, and follow- ing the sequence of orient, press, sinter operat ions. In spite of the numerous cost and mag- netic property advantages of the Nd–Fe–B magnets over the rare earths–cobalt magnets, the Nd–Fe–B magnets have one major limitation. Their Curie temperature is low. Attemptshave been made to overcome this proble m through partial replacement of neodymium by cobalt and/or dysprosium. Other beneficial elemental additives are aluminum and gallium.06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMRARE EARTH MATERIALS 425 Attempts to realize in practical magnets the theoretical maximum energy product for Nd–Fe–B magnets, namely, 512 kJ/m3, led to the development of what are known as the super high energy magnets. The making of su ch magnets was found to be dependent upon controlling the chemical composition, increasing the volume fraction of the Nd2Fe14B phase, improving particle size distribution, an d adopting the isostatic pressing method to get better alignment of fine particles. Another limitation of neodymium iron boron magnets is the susceptibility of the fine powder magnet alloy to oxidation. Oxidatio n lowers the magnetic property Br. Certain additives for increasing coercivity also decreas e Br. The twin problems of oxidation resist- ance and decreased use of additives were addr essed in the process known as the “two alloy method” for the manufacture of the magnet. A main alloy with the composition Nd12.3Fe81.8B5.9 was mixed with a suballoy rich in cobalt and also having dysprosium, praseodymium and gallium in the ratio 90:10, and after sintering the final composition of the magnet was Nd11.3Pr1.6Dy0.8Fe76.9Co3.1B5.9Ga0.3. This magnet was superior to that produced by the conventional (one alloy) met hod, in terms of energy product, coercivity, and also oxidation resistance. The corrosion re sistance of the magnet was still not sufficient for final service conditions, and multilayer co ating was needed for corrosion protection of the magnet. Rare earths are not only important materials for permanent magnets, but also versatile magnetic materials. The alloy Tb0.3Dy0.7Fe1.9, called “terfenol-D,” is a remarkable magnetostrictive material. Terfenol-D has been produced either by the conventional method of direct melting of the constituents in an arc furnace or by a thermit type reduction of appropriate amounts of TbF3, DyF3 and FeF3 with calcium, in a crucible lined with CaF2. Initially GdPd, and later the intermetallics (Dy0.5Er0/5)Al2 and TbNi2, were identified as magnetic refrigeration material s for cooling gases and systems to as low as 4 K. These materials have been usually prepared by arc melting of 99.8 at % pure rare earth metals and >99.99% pure nickel or aluminum in correct proportion. A process known as centrifugal atomization has been used to produce ~200 µm size fine particles of cryocooler materials such as Er3Ni, DyCo, and (Er0.9Yb0.1)Ni. High pressure gas atomization has also been used to produce uniform sphe rical powders of high purity Er3Ni. Both these techniques are superior in powder shape, purity, and composition, to methods such as mechanical grinding of cast ingots into po wder, spark erosion, and rotating electrode pressing. Another special application of rare ea rth as magnetic materials is in magnetooptic storage media. Here thin films (500 µ thick) of amorphous alloy such as Tb25(Fe0.9Co0.1)75 is deposited onto a transparent plastic substrate by some form of sputtering process. Storage medium in modern magnetooptic discs can also be the amorphous alloy GdTbFe. The intermetallic LaNi5 behaves like a hydrogen sponge. When hydrogen is introduced into a finely divided alloy of LaNi5, it will be absorbed at room temperature and bound in the lanthanum nickel hydride LaNi5H6 that is formed. At a higher temperature, e.g., 150°C, the hydrogen is desorbed at a comfortable rate. This property of LaNi5 has led to numerous applications. The preparation of LaNi5 is done by arc melting together the pure metals in the proper stoichiometry. The arc melted alloy ingot is broken to granule size in a hardened steel mortar and pestle. The allo y granules are coated with a metallic copper thin layer by a chemical plating method to pr event their crumbling to fine powder due to repeated hydriding–dehydriding. In addition to LaNi5, (La, Ce)Ni5 and MMNi5 alloys have also been used. All these alloys have also been directly prepared by calcium reduction of coprecipitated RE2(CO3)2.5Ni2(OH)2.CO3.2H2O. One of the most recent and remarkable appl ications of rare earths is in the new06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 426 generation high- Tc superconductors. High Tc was first reported in a multiphase Ba–La–Cu–O compound, and one of the mo st important compositions that has Tc above liquid nitrogen temperatures is a Y–B a–Cu–O (YBCO) compound. The YBCO phase responsible for superconductivity is pe rovskite-like with a composition of Y1Ba2Cu3O7–x (commonly referred to as 1–2–3 phase). Th ere are three main techniques for making high- Tc superconductors. First, the materials can be deposited onto a single crystal structure by methods such as evaporation, laser ablati on, or sputtering so that epitaxial growth occurs. Second, thick films can be made by mi xing the powder with various polymers and solvents and applying it to a suitable polycrys talline ceramic or metallic substrate. Third, bulk materials can be made by sinter ing a powder of right stoichiometry. Thin film (0.5 µm) superconductors are capable of carrying large amounts of current (10 million amps cm–2), but they are not suitable for ma ny applications because of their fragility. Thick film tapes (1–2 µm thick) conduct one million amps cm–2 and can retain half of its current-carrying ability in magnetic fields as high as nine tesla. In one process developed at the Los Alamos National Labora tory, a three-layer tape comprising YBCO compound and zirconium oxide placed on a p liable nickel alloy tape was made. By pulsed layer deposition of thick films (6–10 µm) of Y-123, Los Alamos researchers have obtained Jc values greater than 1 MA/cm2 at 77 K. This potentially scaleable technique may be used to prepare superconductor coated continuously on long lengths of metal or ceramic substrates with suitable buffer layers. Bu lk superconducting YBaCuO can be made by sintering Y2O3, CuO, and BaO under carefully controlled conditions. To obtain bulk super- conductor with good mechanical properties, hi gh purity starting materials in the form of submicrometer size powder is essential. Us ing various processing routes, coils and shapes can then be fabricated. To achieve high current densities in polycrystalline wires and thick films of ceramic superconductors, texturing is essential. Texturing is achieved in variousways such as melt texturing, rolling, and solidification in hi gh magnetic fields. A process known as the metallic precurso r approach has been used to prepare long lengths of high T c ceramic superconducting wires. The process proceeds through the stages of mechanical alloying of metallic precursor elements, repeated extrusion and compound forming by internal oxidation, and thermomechanical treatments. A great variety in applications and an eq ually wide range of methods for processing mark the role of rare earth materials in m odern technology. New techniques of materials synthesis such as mechanical alloying, self-propagating high temperature synthesis, various thin and thick film production techniqu es, and also techniques for production and control of materials structures at the na nometer scale, popularly known as “nano- processing,” when applied to the production and processing of rare earth materials will open up more new possibilities of applications as well as newer challenges to rare earth materials processing. These will keep up the ne w tradition of advanced rare earth materials evolution to fulfill the newer needs of humankind in the new millennium.06 Chapter 6 357-42 6.fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:46 PMCHAPTER 7 A Sojourn in the World of Rare Earths The authors have, through the preceding chapters, provided a comprehensive account of the rare earths family members in their collective as well as individual forms. This final chapter offers a concise description of the rare earth s that will be not only informative, but also enlightening for general readers and those who wi sh to have a look into the world of the rare earths out of inquisitiveness. The perusal of this chapter, on the whole, will provide the reader with a substantial fund of knowledge. It will be useful to begin this chapter wi th a general introduction to the elements, and this is best accomplished by dealing first with the electronic structure of atoms. The behavior of each of the electrons that surround the nucleus of an atom of an element is described by a wave function that re presents a solution to the Schrödinger wave equation. These wave functions define the spat ial distribution of electron density about the nucleus, i.e., the probability of locating an el ectron at a particular point at a particular instant in time. Boundary surfaces enveloping the regions of high electron density are called atomic orbitals. The overall wave functi on, providing a total description of the state of an electron in an atom of an element, is expressed in terms of quantum numbers. The quantum numbers result from the solution of the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom. Although the results for this atom re present only an approximation for atoms of elements containing more than one electro n, the hydrogen atom forms the model for discussing multi-electron atoms of elemen ts. There are four quantum numbers, each of which can assume only certain permitted numerical values: n, the principal quantum number, is a positive integer (1, 2, 3, 4,... but not 0); l, the azimuthal quantum number, can only be a positive integer less than n (0, 1, 2;3,..., ( n – 1)); m, the magnetic quantum number, can possess all integral values from +1 to –1; s, the spin quantum number, can have only the values + or – . As already mentioned, the hydrogen atom orbitals provide the basis for the treatment of multi-electron atoms of elements. Each electron in a multi-electron atom is considered as moving in an atomic orbital that is qual itatively like the hydrogen atom orbitals. Four quantum numbers are required to designate each of the orbitals, as in the hydrogen atom case, and the quantum numbers possess the same physical significance. An additional stipulation is required to comprehend the li nkage between the electron structure of atoms1 2---1 2--- 07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 428 and the physicochemical behavior of elem ents. This condition, which was proposed by Wolfgang Pauli and has come to be known as Pauli’s exclusion principle, has far-reaching consequences in chemistry. Figure 7.1 The s, p, and d atomic orbitals. 07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMA SOJOURN IN THE WORLD OF RARE EARTHS 429 Pauli’s exclusion principle stipulates that each electron in an atom of an element is characterized by its own unique set of quantum numbers and that no two electrons belonging to that atom can possess the same set of quantum numbers. The Pauli principleis a fundamental principle. It finetunes the conduct of electrons over and above theSchrödinger equation. The first of the quantum numbers, n, relates to the average distance of the electron from the nucleu s (hence the size of the orbita l). It is the most important factor deciding the energy of an electron. Electrons with n = l, 2, 3, 4,... are said to occur in the K, L, M, N,... shells of the atom and ar e located at progressively increasing distances from the nucleus. The second quantum number, l, can be considered to be a measure of the angular momentum of the electron. It is rela ted to the shape of the orbital. Azimuthal quantum numbers are normally designated s, p, d, f rather than 0, 1, 2, 3 (hence a 3 s orbital has n = 3, l = 0). The third quantum number, m, is also called the orbital quantum number. This is because it indicates the orientation of the orbital in space. For example, in a 2porbital, n = 2, l = 1 and m can take the values +1, 0, –1. Hence, there are three kinds of porbitals, p x, py, and pz, which differ in their orientations but are equivalent in energy (degenerate). Each orbital may ho ld only two electrons, one with s = + and the other with s = – . The spin quantum number indicates that an electron may be regarded as spinning either clockwise or counterclockwise about an axis and producing a magnetic field that may be in either one of two opposite directions. The shapes and orientations of the s, p, and d atomic orbitals are shown in Figure 7.1. The s orbitals are spherically symmetrical; the 1 s orbital ( n = l; l = 0; m = 0; s =± ) is the lowest-energy atomic orbital and may cont ain one A electron (as in hydrogen) or two electrons with opposite (paired) spins (as in helium and all heavier elements). The next orbital to be filled is the 2 s orbital, which can similarly contain one or two electrons. Following this there are the three 2 p orbitals ( n = 2; l = 1; m= +1, 0, –1; s = ± ), which are dumbbell-shaped orbitals directed alon g the three Cartesian axes (i.e., along three mutually perpendicular directions). Two lobe s of high electron density are separated by a nodal plane of zero density, and the sign of th e wave function is positive in one lobe and negative in the other. The 3 s and 3 p orbitals succeed the 2 p orbitals in energy and are in turn followed by the 3 d orbitals (also shown in Figure 7.l). Prior to defining the status of the electron distribution in a multi-electron atom, it is important to gain an understanding of the ener gy level sequence of the orbitals. The starting reference may be drawn to the hydrogen atom. The energies of the hydrogen atom orbitals depend only on n, and the corresponding energy level sequence is shown in Figure 7.2(a). In atoms of the other elements, the occurren ce of more than one electron induces electron repulsion effects, which bring about a modificatio n in this orbital energy pattern. The initial task, therefore, is to ascertain the sequence of the energies of the orbitals in multi-electron atoms. Once the sequence of the energies of the orbitals is established, the electronic structure of the atoms of various elements is de lineated simply by placing one electron at a time in the lowest energy orbital available, su bject to, of course, compliance with the Pauli principle. The origin of the periodicity in the properties of elements then becomes very obvious. The orbital energy pattern and the Pa uli principle are essential for understanding the structure of the periodic table. In order to comprehend why and how the en ergy level scheme of the hydrogen atom gets modified, one may consider the ground st ate distribution of electrons in the atoms of the three elements hydrogen, helium, and lithium, which possess one, two, and three electrons, respectively. In hydrogen, the elect ron belongs to the lowest energy orbital, 1 s; the electron in the orbital is arbi trarily designated by an “up” ( m = + ) spin. This particular1 2--- 1 2--- 1 2--- 1 2--- 1 2---07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 430 orbital can host the second electron of helium only if it possesses the opposite spin. If the two electrons were to possess the same spin, the three orbital quantum numbers ( n, l, and m) as well as the spin quantum number ( s) would be the same. This is not allowed according Figure 7.2 The energy level diagram valid for (a) the hydrogen atom and (b) multi- electron atoms; (c) the variation of orbi tal energies with atomic number (Z). 07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMA SOJOURN IN THE WORLD OF RARE EARTHS 431 to Pauli’s principle. Thus, there being no room in the 1 s orbital for further electrons, the third electron of lithium has to go to the next higher energy orbital. The question now arises as to where the third electron may be placed: in the 2 s orbital or in the 2 p orbitals? If the hydrogen atom energy level pattern were to hold good for multi-electron atoms, it would have made no difference since all these orbita ls would have the same energy. It, however, so happens that the 2 s orbital has a lower energy than the 2p orbitals in lithium. The maxima or peaks of the 2 s and the 2 p orbitals have been found to be at distances greater than the 1 s maximum. Therefore, an electron in the 2 s or the 2 p orbitals in lithium will be further outside as compared to the two 1 s electrons. The third electron will not feel the pull due to the full nuclear charge because the shielding effect of the inner 1 s electrons. The shielding experienced by a 2 s electron, however, is less than that experienced by a 2 p electron, since the 2 s orbital approaches closer to th e nucleus. This implies that a 2 s electron experiences a greater a ttraction from the nucleus than a 2 p electron does. It may, in other words, be said that a 2 s electron is more tightl y held or bound than a 2 pelectron. The 2 p orbitals, therefore, have more energy than the 2 s orbital. In general, orbitals with the same n but different l do not possess the same energy in multi-electron atoms. Within a set of orbitals with a given n, the energy increases as l increases. This is a consequence of the fact that as the value of l increases, the extent of approach of the orbital to the proximity of the nucleus decreases and the shielding due to the inner electrons becomes more dominating. It may, therefore, be said that an electron with a large l experiences less nuclear charge. The en ergy level pattern, which is qualitativ- ely true for nearly all multi-electron atoms, is provided in Figure 7.2(b). The variation in orbital energy with atomic number is shown in Figure 7.2(c). To sum up, it may be pointed out that (1) the energies of the np orbitals are higher than that of the ns orbital, but consider- ably lower than that of the ( n + l)s orbital; (2) the energies of the nd orbitals are comparable with the energy of the ( n + l)s orbital, but less than the energies of the ( n+1)p orbitals; and (3) the nf orbitals are comparable in energy to the ( n + l)d orbitals. Once the energy level sequence is derived, it becomes quite simp le to delineate the electron configuration in atoms making use of the Aufbau principle, wh ich simply states that electrons should be placed, one at a time, in the lowest energy or bital available, without violating the Pauli principle. In addition, two rules, known as Hu nd’s rules, are taken in to account in arriving at the electronic configurations of multi-elect ron atoms. These rules are as follows: (1) in filling a group of orbitals of equal energy, it is energetically preferable to assign electrons to empty orbitals rather than placing them in orbitals that are partly occupied; and (2) when two electrons are placed in two different orbi tals, the energy is lower if the spins are parallel. The carbon atom and the boron atom (corre sponding to atomic numbers six and five, respectively), will be used here as examples. The electron configuration in the latter atom is 1s2 2s2 2p1 and that in the former is 1 s2 2s2 2p2. It is known that the pair of electrons in the 1 s orbital must have opposed spins. The same is true of the two electrons in the 2 s orbital. There are three orbitals in the 2 p sublevel (2 px, 2py and 2 pz). The single 2 p electron in boron could be placed in any of these orbitals. Its spin could be either “up” ( m=+ ) o r “down” ( m = – ). The orbital diagram is ordinarily drawn with the first electron in an orbital arbitrarily designated by an “up” arrow, ↑: 1 2--- 1 2--- 1s 2 s 2 p Boron: ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑ 2px 2py 2pz07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 432 With the next element, carbon, a complica tion arises. Where should the sixth electron be placed? One could put it in th e same orbital as the other 2 p electron, in which case it would have to have the opposite spin, ↓. It could also be placed in one of the other two orbitals ( 2py or 2 pz), either with a parallel spin, ↑, or an opposed spin, ↓. Experiments reveal that there is an energy difference between these arrangements. The most stable configuration is the one in wh ich the two electrons are in different orbitals with parallel spins. The orbital diagram of the carbon atom is thus: One could see that the above procedure is prescribed by Hund’s rules. The examples dealt with representatively provide the gene ral outline of the procedure by which one derives the ground state configuration of atoms. 7.1 THE PERIODIC TABLE OF ELEMENTS The foregoing descriptive matter regarding the electron distribution in multi-electron atoms points to the origin of periodicity in the properties of elements. The most orderly and well-founded presentation reflecting this period ic feature is the periodic table of elements, which is a classically outstanding chemical port rayal of elements. No parallel or alternative mode of presentation that is as comprehensiv e has been suggested. The table provides an arrangement of elements in the order of incr easing atomic number in horizontal rows of such lengths that elements with similar chem ical properties appear in the same vertical column. If one examines the long form of the periodic table in different textbooks, one will notice such vertical columns of elements; each column is referred to as a group and the different groups are numbered or labeled across the top for identification. From the time of Mendeleev, whose name is synonymous with the periodic table, there has been no general agreement as to the numbering system to be adopted. Most chemists use a system of Roman numerals (I to VIII) and the letters A and B. The Inter-national Union of Pure and Applied Chemis try (IUPAC) has recommended that the 18 groups should be numbered consecu tively from left to right, 1 to 18. This is also a common numbering system used in some texts. This system refers to the main-group elements (i.e., elements in the two groups at the far left and the six groups at the right) as Groups 1 through The transition elements, to which referen ce will be made later, in the center of the periodic table, are not assigned group number s. Of the systems mentioned above, the first labeling scheme will be used here, but the ot her two notations will be shown in parentheses in the order mentioned. The group on the left side of the table, labeled IA (or 1 or 1) is called the alkali metals group. The elements of the ne xt group, labeled IIA (2 or 2) are the alkaline earth metals. The elements of group VIIIA (18 or 8) are called the noble gases because they are not reactive. To the left of the noble gase s are the halogens labeled VIIA (17 or 7). The elements in groups labeled A (1, 2, 13–18 or 1, 2, 3–8) are called the representative or main group elements and those labeled B (3–11 or group numbers not assigned) are called the transition metals. This is the description of the table that one generally comes across. Having described the group classification, it is only appropriate that reference is drawn1s 2 s 2 p Carbon: ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑ 2p x 2py 2pz↑07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMA SOJOURN IN THE WORLD OF RARE EARTHS 433 to the significance of the (horizontal) rows . The elements within a row (sometimes called a period) exhibit a gradual vari ation in behavior, which implie s that any particular element shows some similarity with its neighbors, bu t appreciable dissimilarity with those who are not neighbors. These vertical–horizontal charact eristics of the periodic table indicate that the table can be “construed” like a crossword pu zzle. In addition, the periodic “puzzle” con- tains, at many positions, diagonal patterns, whic h also highlight certain patterns of physico- chemical behavior. Next, the table can be regarded from the el ectron configuration point of view. With this particular term of reference, the period ic table separates the elements into blocks in which s, p, d, and f orbitals are filled up. It is intere sting to describe the classification of elements on this basis. It turns out that the elements can be classified into four general types. Elements of the first type are the inert (or noble) elements. They are all characterized by a completely filled outer shell with the configuration ns2np6, helium being an exception. Helium also has a completely occupied outer shell but the configuration is 1 s2. The second class is made up of the representative elements. They are the elements of the s-block and the p-block, with the exception of the inert elem ents. They all possess incomplete outer- most shells. The electronic configuration ranges from ns1 to ns2np5. The third type of element is the transition elements, which have the two farthest incomplete shells with the general configuration ( n – 1)d1–9ns1o r2. There are three transition series corresponding to the incompletely filled 3 d, 4d, and 5 d orbitals. These elements reside in the center of the table, in the nine columns from group IIIB through group 1B (3–11 or no group number assigned). The elements in group IIB (12 or no group number assigned), the zinc family (zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), and helium (Hg)), are not transition me tals according to the definition. Even though they are found in the “ d-block” of the table, their d orbitals are always completely filled. The fourth type of element is similar to the transition elements but differ from the regular transition elements in that they have three outermost incomplete shells. Called “inner transition elemen ts,” they not only have incomplete d-levels, but they also have incomplete f-levels. There are two sets or series of such elements, each consisting of 14 elements. The filling of f-sublevels with a principal quantum number that is two less than the period number occurs in these. Th e elements of the first set or series, the lanthanides (cerium (Ce) through lutetium (L u)) are the elements that follow lanthanum (La) in period 6; in these the 4 f-sublevels get filled up. The second set or series of elements, the actinides (thorium (Th) through lawrenci um (Lr)), fitting in period 7 after actinium (Ac), are associated with the filling of the 5 f-sublevel. It has been mentioned earlier that in one of the forms of presentation of the periodic table, the transition elements, at the center of the table, are not assigned group numbers. The same is true of the inner transition elements in that they do not belo ng to any of the groups labeled at the top of the table. While all the elements, but one, belonging to the former family are naturally available, only a few of the elements of the latter family are natu rally occurring. Moreover, the members of the latter family, unlike those of th e former, are all radioactive. 7.2 RADIATION A brief account of radiation is relevant here in recognition of the fact that monazite, one of the industrial sources of rare earths, with varying amounts contain thorium, which is radioactive. In fact, in some countries of the world monazites serve as the principal07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 434 suppliers of rare earths. Processing of mona zites for the recovery of their contained rare earths necessitates the consideration of radio activity arising due to thorium. Radiation comprises energy traveling through space. It is essential to the environment of human beings and includes visible light and radio wave s as well as radiant heat from the sun. Life on earth has evolved with an ever-present background of radiation. Natural background radiation is the sum total of the contributions from cosmic rays; radiation from soil, rocks and building materials; as well as ingested radioactive isotopes. Living organisms appear to be able to cope well with this radiat ion, provided the levels are not too high. Radiation originates from atoms — the basic building blocks of matter. Everything in the universe is made of atoms. A thousand milli on atoms side-by-side might just fill up the space occupied by a period on this page. Most atoms are stable; an oxygen-16 atom remains an oxygen-16 atom forever. Some atoms, however, eventually disintegrate to yi eld totally new atoms. Such atoms are said to be “unstable” or “radioactive.” An unstable atom possesses more internal energy than is strictly required with the result that the nu cleus can undergo a spontaneous rearrangement to a more stable form. This is called “radioac tive decay.” When an unstable atom undergoes radioactive decay, it emits some of its extra energy as radiation in the form of gamma rays or as fast moving particles. Radioactive d ecay may occur in several successive stages, all the time progressing to a stable state where th e final product atom is no longer radioactive. Radiation of only one type, namely, ionizing radiation, will be considered now. This comes in two forms, rays and particles. Ioni zing radiation is special because it has the ability to affect the large chemical molecu les of which living organisms are made and thereby may implement alterations that are biol ogically important. The list of several types of ionizing radiation includes x-rays and gamma rays, alpha particles, beta particles, cosmic rays, and neutrons. Apart from its generation from natural sources, ionizing radiation is also generated in a range of medical, commercial, and industrial activities. The most familiar of these sources is medical x-ray equipment. In te rms of exposure to this radiation, natural sources account for about 87% of the annual dose to the population, while medical procedures account for near ly all of the balance. Each radioactive species decays at a charact eristic rate. The time involved in the decay, the number of steps in the process and the kinds of radiation released in each step are by now well known. In the context of ra dioactive decay, the term “half-life period” is widely used. This term is defined as the time taken for half of the atoms of a given assemblage of atoms of a radioactive species to decay. Half-life periods can range from less then a millionth of a second to millions of y ears, depending on the radioactive species under consideration. After one half-life, the level of radioactivity of a substance is halved; after two half-lives it comes down to one quarter; af ter three half-lives to one eighth, and so on. Many of the endowments of nature can be of great benefit to humanity but may also have associated risks when misused. Radia tion is no exception. Radioactive materials should be used only when the benefits signif icantly outweigh the risks. Ionizing radiation, like a multitude of other agencies, may cause serious health effects in human beings. The degree of damage caused by this radiation depe nds on many factors — dose, dose rate, type of radiation, the part of the b ody exposed, age, health of th e person subjected to exposure, and so on. We have a range of simple, sensitive instru ments capable of detecting minute amounts of radiation, from natural and man-made sources. In the context of protection from radiation, it is equally important to know th at there are four ways in which we can protect ourselves. These are time, distan ce, shielding, and containment.07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMA SOJOURN IN THE WORLD OF RARE EARTHS 435 7.3 LANTHANIDE AND ACTINIDE ELEMENTS We’d like to resume with a discussion of the lanthanide and the actinide elements. These elements, while assigned no group numbers, are placed separately and shown below the main body of the periodic table. This mode of representation gives a compact appearance and, more importantly, helps to place simila r elements in their appropriate abodes in a single column in the table. It is interesting to point out an additional feature arising from the periodic arrangement of the elements; this pertains to the trends that are observed in respect of atomic radii. The trends regarding the atomic radii of the main group elements are very regular. Across a period there is a decrease in the atomic radi us as one moves from left to right, while proceeding down a group there is an increase in this parameter. These trends are explained by considering the two major factors that in fluence the atomic size — the effective nuclear charge and the principal quantum number of the outermost electron orbital. In the case of the d-block elements, the decrease in size across a row is not as significant as with the main group elements. The trends observed down tr ansition metal groups are somewhat unusual. There is an increase in radius between the fo urth and the fifth period transition metals, as expected from the increase in the principal quantum number of the outermost electrons. However, there is an unexpected similarity am ong the radii of the fifth and the sixth period transition elements. The explanation for this ph enomenon lies in the lanthanide series of elements (from cerium, atomic number 58, to lutetium, atomic number 71), which appear between the elements lanthanum and hafnium in the sixth period. The electrons in the completely filled 4 f-sublevel in hafnium and the other el ements of the sixth row transition metals do not completely shield the valen ce electrons, thus causi ng a larger effective nuclear charge to be experienced by the outermost electrons. A consequence of this increase in the effective nuclear charge is a re duction in the atomic radii, called the lantha- nide contraction. This contraction nearly can cels or nullifies the expected increase in the atomic radius between the fifth and the sixth period transition metal elements. An important consequence of the lanthanide contraction is that many of the fifth and sixth period transition elements show remarkab le similarities in their physical and chemical properties. For example, hafnium is very simi lar to zirconium in atomic radius and their chemistries are nearly identical, but these ar e quite different from those of titanium. The chemical behaviors of zirconium and hafnium are so similar that it took more than a hundred years for chemists to realize that ha fnium occurred as an impurity in all samples of zirconium. Until 1923, when hafnium wa s finally identified, every published atomic weight of zirconium was wrong. All the physi cal constants that were assigned to zirconium actually applied to the naturally occurring mi xtures of zirconium and hafnium. Even with today’s superior technology, the two elements are difficult to separate from one another. The lanthanide contraction effects exert a simi lar influence on two other pairs of elements: tantalum and niobium, and tungsten and molybdenum. The lanthanide contraction also has other co nsequences. One physical property that is directly influenced is the density of the elements of the sixth period. These elements possess unusually high densities because their atomic radii are virtually the same as those of the fifth period elements in the same grou p, while their atomic masses are almost twice as large. Osmium and its neighbor iridium ha ve the highest densities among all naturally occurring elements. The chemical activity of th e sixth period elements is also influenced by the lanthanide contraction. Because of th e high effective nuclear charge experienced by07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 436 their valence electrons, sixth period elements such as platinum, gold, and mercury are relatively inert. Because of this chemical inactivity, platinum and gold are among the few metallic elements that occur in nature in an uncombined state. All told, the lanthanide contraction not only causes the periodic tabl e’s orderly progression to be interrupted, but also is instrumental in producing chemical effects in other elements. According to the definition provided by th e International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the element lanthanum (L a), the 14 elements starting from cerium (atomic number 58) and ending with lutetium (atomic number 71), and the 2 group IIIB (3) elements, scandium and yttrium, with atomic numbers 21 and 39, respectively, form what are termed the rare earths. The inclusion of the two group IIIB elements in the list of the rare earths is based on the invariable occurrence of the former with the latter in nature and the similarity in ionic radii. Significant scan dium enrichment, however, is seldom found in rare earth minerals although very minor amou nts are widely distributed in many minerals. The rare earths are divided into two groups on the basis of differences in properties: the light or cerium group comprising the first seven members lanthanum to europium (atomic num- bers 57 through 63), and the heavy or yttriu m group comprising the elements with atomic numbers ranging from 64 to 71 (gadolinium to lutetium), plus yttrium and scandium. Despite its low atomic weight, yttrium is placed in this group because its occurrence, ionic radius, and properties are similar to those of the other members belonging to this group. From the preceding account, it is clear that the term “rare earths” is a collective name for a group of 17 elements of which 16 are na turally occurring. They are all metals in the elemental state and form salts that are stro ng electrolytes. While “rare earths” is the common name for these elements, earths is an old name for what are now known to be oxides, and these elements are not truly ra re. The most plentiful amongst the family, cerium, is more abundant than lead in the earth’s crust and thulium, the least plentiful member of the family, is more abundant than cadmium, silver, gold, or platinum. The light group members (La through Eu) are more abundant than the heavy group members (Gdthrough Lu). In this context it may also be pointed out that elements with even atomic numbers are found to be more abundant than their neighbors with odd atomic numbers. Thus the rare earths are neither rare nor eart hs. Truly speaking, the word “rarity” stems from the difficulty experienced in separating th e rare earths into individual elements and not from their relative abundance. All the rare earths occur naturally except one. This member is promethium. It should be pro duced artificially from neodymium by bombard- ment with neutrons. The process yields a neodymium isotope, which decays by betaemission to promethium, which is radioactive with a half-life of 3.7 years. It may be mentioned here that this radioactive elemen t possesses many amazing nuclear and chemical properties. It has been compared with an en tity in a sealed envelope, with many more mysteries to be unraveled in the future. Th e rare earths are finally a community of 16 naturally occurring elements since pr omethium does not occur naturally. The description of the classification of the elements made on the basis of electronic configuration provided earlier brings out the f act that there is a close linkage between the electronic structure and the chemical behavior of the elements. Thus, all the inert gases have similar electronic structures (fully filled ns and np orbitals) and they behave alike chemically. Similarly, the chemically alike alkali metals have a single s electron outside the closed shell. All halogens have the ns 2np5 electronic configuration while oxygen, sulfur and selenium, with a strong chemical resemblance to each other, have the configurations 2 p4, 3p4, and 4 p4, respectively. The classification of the elements as metals and nonmetals also bears a correlation with the electronic structur e. Most metals, such as sodium, beryllium,07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMA SOJOURN IN THE WORLD OF RARE EARTHS 437 and aluminum, have one to three electrons more, and most nonmetals, such as fluorine, oxygen and nitrogen, have one to three electrons less, as compared to the corresponding closed-shell configuration. The striking simila rity in chemical behaviour exhibited by the lanthanides and the actinides is also understand able, as the outer orbital structure in each of these groups is the same, differe nces occurring only in the 4 f- and 5 f-levels. The same reasoning applies for the three transition series where the diffe rences are only in the number of d electrons. The elements belonging to this class show a significant resemblance to each other; e.g., they form colored ions, possess se veral valence states, form coordination com- pounds, and so on. Introductory textbooks, wh ile dealing with the rare earths, often view them as being chemically so si milar to one another that collect ively they are treated as one element. To a certain degree this is correct, an d many of their uses are based on this close similarity. However, important differences in their behavior and properties do exist; for example, the melting points of the end members of the series differ by a factor of almost two (lanthanum (La): 918°C, lutetium (Lu): 1663°C). The very similar chemical properties of the individual members of the rare earths family should, in no way, be construed to im ply that they will always remain inseparably together. Separation between the rare earths family members is entirely possible, though not easy. Mention must be made here of an im portant feature that has made such separation feasible. Knocking out three electrons from th e neutral atom in the rare earths elements causes the liberation of ions ha ving slightly different sizes . The size or the ionic radius decreases with increasing atomic number. Lanthanum has the largest (0.12 nm) and lutetium has the smallest (close to 0.10 nm) ionic radius. These differences in ionic radii bring about differences in ionic potentials a nd consequently differences in their hydrated radii in aqueous solutions. This helps in a graded separation of the rare earths familymembers through chromatography. The small di fferences in their solubility are exploited in a separation technique known as fractional crystallization, which implements separation between the rare earths. There are, of course , other well-developed techniques by which rare earths separation is accomplished. More than 95% of the rare earth oxides (REO ) occur in three minerals: (1) bastnasite, a fluorocarbonate (REFCO 3), which theoretically contains about 75% REO and very minor amounts (0.05%) of yttrium; (2) monazi te, a rare earth phosphate ((RE,Y)ThPO4)2, which can theoretically contain up to 70% combined REO, including about 2% yttrium oxide (but most concentrates contain about 55 to 65 % REO); and (3) xenotime, an yttrium rich phosphate mineral ((Y,RE)PO4) that can theoretically cont ain about 67% yttrium oxide. Among these, the first two, bastnasite and mo nazite, are the sources of the light group of the rare earths. Xenotime and also uranium tailings are sources of the heavy group and of yttrium. Bastnasite is the world’s major source of REO; it is mined as a primary product by Molycorp from the Mountain Pass deposit in California and as a by-product of iron ore mining in China. The five major countrie s producing monazite are Australia, Brazil, Malaysia, China, and India. The major prod ucers of xenotime are Malaysia, China, and Australia. World production in concentrate, intermediate, and final product forms isapproximately 60,000 t/a of REO. The industr y is dominated by China, Europe, and the U.S., with several small producers of high value products in Japan. Australia was thedominant producer of monazite in the 1980s, the source being Western Australia’s titanium minerals industry, but the scenario has change d in recent years due to the availability of cheaper ores from China. Currently, the rare earths are not produced in Western Australia. Some relevant projects are, however, under co nsideration. Some salient features of these projects have been presented in Table 7.1. Ther e is certainly an abiding interest in the rare ooo07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 438 earths in the countries of the world that are endowed with rare earths resources and reserves of commercial significance. 7.4 PROCESSING RARE EARTHS What follows is a presentation of the ways by which rare earth resources are processed. Attention is first focused on bastanasite. The mined product is comminuted and subjected to a flotation process. The co ncentrate ensuing from the proces s is thickened, filtered, and rotary kiln dried to produce a rare earth oxide (REO) concentrate. The concentrate can be further upgraded to 70% REO by leaching with 10% hydrochloric acid to remove calcite. This 10% acid treatment does not affect bastanasite. A concentrate with 85% REO isTable 7.1 Proposed Western Australian projects Producer General description and information Name: Aston Rare Earths Ltd. Location: Mt. Weld, 15 km south of Laverton Capacity: Cerium oxide, 2,500 t/a (proposed) Ownership: Aston Mining Ltd. (100%)The Mt. Weld Rare Earths Project is based on a large monaziteresource (with low radioactivity) containing nearly 1.3 Mt of ore witha REO content of 23.6%, capable of supplying 10% of the world’s demand for rare earths for a period of over 20 years. When developed, the project envisages operation at two locations. A mine and a concentrator at Mt. Weld is to produce 12,000 t/a of monazite concentrate. A second, plant, capable of producing rare earth oxide products, is to be located at M eenaar Industrial Park, 20 km east of Northam. The deposit is rich in cerium, which constitutes about 50% of the contained rare earth oxides. Initially, Aston Rare Earths has decided to focus on the production of cerium products, as they have thegreatest growth potential in the near future. Applications include cerium concentrates for polishing powder production; high grade cerium concentrates for use in specialty glasses; cerium carbonate for the autocatalyst market; high grade cerium oxide for the specialty glass/ceramic mark et. In addition, Aston Rare Earths is to produce a “cerium depleted co ncentrate” which is to be marketed to rare earths processors in Asia and Europe. In the long term, theseconcentrates will be processed to separate the following rare earths: lanthanum, for rare earth nickel hydride batteries; neodymium, for rare earth magnets; europium, for rare earth phosphors. Name:Rhodia Pinjarra Pty Ltd. Location: Pinjarra, 100 km south of Perth Capacity: 15,000 t/a (proposed) Ownership. Rhodia Chimie (France) (100%) Rhodia Pinjarra Pty Ltd. (formerly Rhône-Poulenc Chimie Australia Pty Ltd.) envisages development of a rare earths plant on a locationadjacent to the company’s existing gallium plant. The project involves processing of monazite ore to produce rare earth nitrate for export. The plant is to be designed to receive, store, and process up to 12,000 t/a of monazite to produce 15,000 t/a of rare earth nitrates and 6000 t/a of residue. The rare earth nitrates are to be shipped to the U.S. and France for further separation and purification. An estimated 23,000 t/a of tri-calcium phosphate is proposed to be sold for fertilizer production. Monazite is produced in Australia as a co-product from the processingof titanium minerals. It is a rare earth phosphate, which also containssmall amounts of other elements, incl uding thorium, uranium, iron, and titanium metals. The monazite feed stock for the proposed processing plant is to be obtained from the existing titanium mineral separation plants at Narngulu (near Geraldton), Eneabba, Capel and Bunbury.07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMA SOJOURN IN THE WORLD OF RARE EARTHS 439 typically produced by roasti ng the leached concentrate. This is carried out to remove carbon dioxide from the carbonate. The con centrate is leached with concentrated hydrochloric acid for conversion to soluble rare earths chlorides. The cerium component, which is oxidized to its higher valence insolubl e oxide during the calci nation step, is passed through a countercurrent decantation and thickeni ng circuit and then filtered, resulting in a filter cake composed of about 70% REO, more than 90% of which is ceric oxide. This precipitate is reprocessed, dried, and market ed as a cerium concentrate. The rare earths in the thickener overflow with a cerium-free rare earth chloride solution, which is separated by solvent extraction into a lanthanum (L a), praseodymium (Pr), and neodymium (Nd) concentrate and a samarium (Sm), gadolinium (Gd), and europium (Eu) concentrate. Each of these concentrates is subject ed to additional solvent extr action and proprietary processes to produce various mixed rare earth compounds and individual oxides. The processing aspects of two other re sources, monazite and xenotime, may be considered next. Both these resources are usuall y digested in an autoclave at 150°C with a 70% sodium hydroxide solution for several ho urs. Hydroxides of the rare earths and of thorium, formed in the reaction, are insolubl e, while trisodium phos phate (TSP) and excess sodium hydroxide remain in solution. Water is added, and after settling the insoluble hydroxides are recovered by filtration; sodium hydroxide is recycled to digestion and TSP is recovered by crystallization. The filter ed hydroxides are washed, and the thorium fraction is removed by using one of several methods. One chemical process involves the mixing of the precipitated rare earths and thorium hydroxides with water; the mixture isbrought to a pH of 3.4 by the addition of h ydrochloric acid. At this pH the rare earths hydroxides get selectively dissolved, forming a rare earths chloride solution. Undissolved thorium hydroxide is removed by filtration an d thermally treated to produce thorium oxide. Here again additional processes are introduced in to the rare earths stream with the objective of producing purified forms of separated rare earths products. A scheme of the processing of monazite is shown in Figure 7.3. The scheme produces essentially two commodities: rare earth nitrates and phosphates for use in fertilizer manufacture. There are five main processing steps: (1) Mixing the monazite with hot causti c soda to dissolve phosphates from the mineral, leaving rare earth hydroxides. Figure 7.3 A scheme for monazite processing. 07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 440 (2) Filtering hydroxides from the solution, allowing the remaining phosphates to be utilized for agriculture fertilizer. The caustic soda is recycled. Tricalcium phosphate is stored temporarily in the evaporation ponds befo re the material goes to fertilizer makers. (3) Reacting the rare earth hydroxides with ni tric acid and barium salt, then filtering the solution to remove insoluble radioactive elements — thorium, uranium, radium — and other inert materials. Evaporation ponds on site store wash waters. (4) Processing the resulting ra re earth nitrates into separated rare earth products. (5) Transporting the radioactive waste arising in the whole processing scheme. It should be clear from the brief coverage provided for the processing routes adopted for the different resources that the rare earths end up (1) as unseparated (or mixed) as direct products of processing or as a result of furt her chemical processing; or (2) as separated individuals in the form of different chemical intermediates such as chlorides, oxides, and fluorides, the most popular usable forms for a variety of purposes. 7.5 APPLICATIONS OF RARE EARTHS A voluminous body of literature testifies to the fact that the rare earths are enormouslyuseful. This presentation attempts to provide ju st an illustrative account, and it is hoped that through this the reader will get interested in the acquisition and dissemination of inform- ation as regards the importance of the rare earths in present-day science and technology. The presentation first concerns itself with ap plications in the form of compounds and then those in the form of metals. An important application pertains to the us e of europium oxide in phosphors for color television picture tubes and other cathode ra y tube (CRT) displays. In combination with yttrium oxide, yttrium oxysulfide, or yttr ium orthovanadate, a superior red color is produced. The application of fluorescent material s for lighting with regard to a three-wave- length lamp has been successful, and this lamp is widely used in the market as the only lamp that simultaneously achieves high efficiency and high color rendering. The lamp derives its white light through the combination of red color from Y 2O3:Eu3+; green color from Figure 7.4 Catalytic converter in automobiles. 07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMA SOJOURN IN THE WORLD OF RARE EARTHS 441 (lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce)) PO4:Tb3+, etc.; and blue color from BaMg2Al16O27:Eu2+ and others. A typical use of the rare earths is as petr oleum cracking catalysts. The petroleum fluid cracking catalysts (FCC) consist of three main constituents: an amorphous silica–alumina refractory binder, a generally inert filler, an d a rare earth containing zeolite (sodium alumi- nosilicate). Lanthanum and cerium chlorides ar e the principal compounds that are used in a mixture form in the production of these catal ysts. Automobile exhaust emission is another important example of the catalytic application of the rare earths. A catalytic converter is incorporated in automobiles. Its role is to transform the primary pollutants in the exhaust gas — carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydr ocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into nontoxic compounds: carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and nitrogen (N2). The exhaust gas is passed through a honeycomb monolith (m etallic or more often ceramic), the interior surface of which is coated with the catalyst formulation consisting of three key ingredients: precious metals (platinum, pa lladium, rhodium), alumina, and rare earth-based materials containing cerium and lanthanum oxides. Rare earths improve the durability of the catalyst and enhance its catalytic activity. Figure 7.4 shows the catalytic converter in place. Although the theoretical basis for the efficacy of the rare earths as polishers is not clear, it appears that besides mechanical pulver ization, chemical reactions contribute to the effect. The sources of polishers are largely confined to bastnasite and the rare earth chlorides, which include cerium oxide polish ers. They are used for polishing the CRTs of televisions and the substrates of photomasks fo r integrated circuits. The use of rare earth compounds for polishing purposes is very we ll founded. A brief description of polishing powders will be presented here. Morphologi cal characteristics of the powders have an influence on the polishing performance in term s of the quantity of glass removed and the quality of the polished surfaces. The three mor phological characteristics of powders are (1) specific surface area, which reflects the degree of particle strength and porosity; (2) degree of external sintering, which influences the grain boundaries; and (3) particle size distribution, which influences the stability of the suspension. Powder characteristics are carefully controlled throughou t processing to ensure quality. The term “polishing effi- ciency” (PE) is often used to qualify polishi ng. It is expressed by the formula, PE = M/sxt, where PE is polishing efficiency in mg/dm2/min, M is weight of glass removed in milli- grams, s is surface of glass in dm2, and t is polishing time in minu tes. It decreases with time as the polishing particles are broken down an d the suspension becomes loaded with glass particles. An improvement in the polishing e fficiency occurs when the polishing bath con- centration is increased. The bath concentration depends mainly on the type of polisher or pad used. When pads are changed from polyuret hane (PU) or nonwoven types to felt or pitch types or to hard polyurethane, the su spension concentration should accordingly be increased. It is generally seen that PE is pr oportional to speed, regardless of the type of polisher and operating conditions used. Ther efore, operation at the maximum speed avail- able, while remaining within the values compat ible with the type of pad used, is recom- mended. An important consideration is the infl uence of the applied pressure on the object to be polished. This is the pres sure applied on the glass to be polished, which is not the same as that indicated by the spindle manometer. At high rotating speeds (>250 rpm), the effect of pressure is very significant up to 0.8 to 1 bar. Beyond this, the PE remains unchanged. When high production rates are sought (in the polishing of st andard spectacle glass, for instance), it becomes mandatory to operate at high rotation speeds (>1000 rpm) and high pressures (>1 bar). There are two other factor s, namely, the water hardness and the sus- pension temperature, on which the PE depe nds. Moderately hard water and operating07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 442 temperatures between 15 to 30°C are ge nerally the recommended parameters. The efficiency of a polishing powder can be evaluate d by two series of tests: the first series of tests concerns the polishing efficiency and qua lity; and the second series of tests concerns the properties of the suspended powder before and after use. In some plants, storage containers are located some distance away or remote from machines. This may result in the powder settling out of solution. It is therefor e important to measure the suspension strength. If the suspension is not used immediately af ter preparation, sedimentation may take place. This can be measured by permitting the suspension to settle for 24 h. It is then stirred and the supernatant liquid is decanted. The resul ting deposit is then dried and weighed. All these events are covered in what is known as packing. There is one additional thing that could occur called “caking.” This is when a depos it is formed in the suspension following the polishing operation. The composite pictur e of a polishing powder can be graphically established from the followin g five parameters: polishing efficiency, surface quality, suspension strength, packing, and caking (Figur e 7.5). With this method or monogram as it may be called, it becomes possible to compar e rapidly the various product properties and determine their fields of application. The use of the rare earths as glass additives constitutes a well-known application field. Neodymium oxide is used to colo r decorative glass from light pink to blue-violet. It is also added to welding glasses to protect the eyes from the yellow flare emitted by sodium vapor. Optical glasses are incorporated with lantha num oxide to increase the index of refraction and decrease the dispersion of light. Camera lenses and other appli cations needing a high degree of light transmission may be cited as ot her important examples of uses of lanthanum oxide. Yttrium oxide and gadolinium oxide are used as additives for lenses. Cerium oxide is used as an achromatic agent, and neodymiu m oxide is used as an additive to the CRT front glass of TVs. The use of the rare earths in laser glasses must be added to this list of applications in glasses. Figure 7.5 Monogram to determine fields of appl ication of a given polishing powder. 07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMA SOJOURN IN THE WORLD OF RARE EARTHS 443 Thin layer single crystals of yttrium–iron –garnet (YIG) show vertical magnetic aniso- tropy and are used for magnetic domain me mory. Yttrium–iron garnets and gadolinium– iron garnets (GIGs) are widely used as ferri te materials in microwave applications. These garnets can be operated in low magnetic fields in the lower microwave frequencies. The rare earths play an important role in the realm of new high strength, high tem- perature ceramics. The stabilization of cubic zirconia (ZrO2) by the addition of yttria (Y2O3) is well known. Stabilized zirconia has se veral major applications. Its use in oxygen sensors in the air–fuel ratio control systems of automobiles can be cited as just one example. As regards the development of new materials, special mention may be made of silicon nitride (Si3N4) doped with yttria (Y2O3) and Si3N4–Al2O3 (SiAlON = Sialon) doped with Y2O3. These materials are already being used in cutting tools and in turbine blades in exhaust gas streams and are being considered for use in engine blocks and other engine parts. Magnetic refrigeration makes use of the en tropy change in a magnetic spin system under the influence of an external magnetic fi eld, which is utilized for cooling. Two major breakthroughs have been reported in magneti c refrigeration. The first one has been the successful demonstration of the fact that sub -room-temperature magnetic refrigeration is a viable technology and that it may be compet itive with conventional gas cycle compression/ expansion refrigeration. A cooling power equiva lent to about 600 watts has been obtained in a laboratory prototype refrigerator using three kilograms of gadolinium spheres as the magnetic refrigerant in a magnetic field of 5T. The second breakthrough is the discovery of the giant magnetocaloric effect (MCE) materials Gd5 (SixGe1–x)4, which have MCEs better (ranging from 25 to 200%) than thos e associated with known prototype magnetic refrigerants, depending on the temperature range. The application fields of the rare earths, bo th in their metallic and alloyed forms, will be discussed next. The major uses of the rare earths are as ad ditives to ductile iron, steels, and nonferrous metals, such as magnesium, and superalloys; as lighter flints; in ordnance, and in research. In most of these applications the rare earths are used as mixed metals in which they are present in their natural proportions. In this form they are popularly known as misch metal. The rare earths, in their separated metallic fo rms, are used only as additives to superalloys and in research. The ductile iron market is quite sizeable for the rare earths; additions to the extent of about 0.2 wt % serve to spheroidize graphite, to counteract the effects of deleterious impurities, and to enhance liquid fluidity. The acceptance of misch metal over magnesium, even though the former costs more, is due to the fact that magnesium volatilizes from the melt, making it difficult to control the quality of the ductile iron, while the rare earths do not volatilize and thus the quality of the fina l product is easier to control. The addition is generally made as a ferro-misch meta l silicide or ferro-cerium silicide. The addition of rare earths to steels is co ntinually gaining acceptance. The extent of addition in this particular area of applicat ion amounts to about 0.2 wt %. The addition of rare earths helps in controlling the sulfur concentration and thus brings about improve- ments mainly in the workability and the transv erse impact values. The major use of the rare earths in the steel sector has been as additives to plate and pipeline steels. Sulfidic forms of the rare earths constitute the most stable sulfides known; only calcium sulfide has a com- parable free energy of formation. Additions ar e generally made in the form of a ferro-misch metal (or cerium) silicide. The addition of rare earths to magnesium improves its st rength, creep resistance, and07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 444 fatigue properties, especially at elevated te mperatures. Minor nonferrous uses of the rare earths include their addition to copper-bas ed and aluminum-based alloys and bronzes. The rare earths, in their pure metallic states, are incorporated in a number of chromium-based, cobalt-based and nickel-based superalloys. Essentially yttrium, lanthan- um, or cerium, of about 0.1 wt %, is added to improve the high temperature oxidation and/or corrosion resistance in various corrosi ve environments including saltwater, com- bustion atmospheres containing sulfur, and in some other environments where superalloys without rare earths added exhibit relatively in ferior properties. The rare earths are believed to form a protective complex oxide coating th at inhibits surface attack. In the case of sulfur-bearing environments, the formation of stable rare earth oxysulfides is believed to provide protection. The pyrophoric nature of the light rare earths, especially cerium, accounts for two important uses: lighter flints and ordnance. A variety of misch metal–iron compositions (60 to 80% misch metal with the remainder mostly iron plus additional minor alloying agents) are used in lighter flints and industrial sparking tools. Fundamental and applied research accounts for the major use of the rare earths in their pure, separated metallic state. Some research is directed toward obtaining more information about the fundamental properties and nature of th ese metals and their allo ys. It is from these results that new applications are likely to be generated. The remaining research is oriented towards translating some of the more promising ideas and developments into commercial realities. To sum up, it may be pointed out that on a volume basis, approximately 95% of the usage of the rare earths is in the mixed form ; the individual elemental forms of the rare earths account for the remaining 5% of the tota l volume, but this component represents over 50% of the monetary value. It must be borne in mind that as in the case of many othermaterials, the markets for the rare earths also have been mixed. There were years when the markets showed a worldwide recession. The us e of the rare earths in steels has dropped considerably due to economical factors and to strong competition from other desulfurizing and shape control processes. The glass an d glass polishing areas have also shrunk somewhat, but the catalysts market was reasonabl y favorable. The bright spot has been the sales of the individual rare earths, i.e., th e high technology component of the rare earths market, which is nearly recession proof. It may, in general, be added that it is apparent to anyone following the literature pertaining to the rare earths that research on rare earths, especially the applied type, has greatly e xpanded, even in those countries that have experienced cutbacks in the funding of science. There used to be a time when most of the research on the rare earths was concentrated in the U.S. That is no longer the case today.Both these trends are healthy and should continue to engender a keen worldwide competition in science, techno logy, and industry involved wi th the rare earths. The future appears to be bright for new innovations and new applications of th e rare earths at the industrial level. It will be of interest to refer to the applications of permanent magnets and the impact of rare earths based magnets. Permanent magnet materials are used throughout the industri- alized world in an enormous variety of applicat ions. Some of the broad fields of application include motors and generators (domestic and in dustrial motors, starter motors, and stepper motors); acoustic devices (loudspeakers, h eadphones, microphones, pick-ups); magneto- mechanical applications (hol dings, couplings, bearings, magn etic separation, actuators), and information technology (IT), telecommuni cations, measurement and control (switches, sensors, traveling wave guides, transducers, MRI tomography). Among the broad fields of07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMA SOJOURN IN THE WORLD OF RARE EARTHS 445 application cited, the largest share goes to motors and generators, amounting to some 35% of the total usage. The most widely used permanent magnetic materials, accounting for about half of the total market in value terms, are the ferrites. Although they have relatively low energy products, they are and will rema in the cheapest source of permanent magnetic fields. The introduction of rare earth perm anent magnets based on samarium–cobalt around 1970 and of neodymium–iron–boron magnets in the mid-1980s ushered in a new era with regard to hard magnetic materials. Samarium –cobalt magnets possess a better temperature stability as compared to neodymium–iron–boron magnets and will continue to be used in most thermally demanding applications. This better temperature stability results from the high Curie temperature of samarium–cobalt magnets, 700–800°C, as against only 312°C for neodymium–iron–boron magnets. Applicat ions that demand a high magnetic strength to weight (or volume) ratio and that do not n eed operation at high temperatures, say, above 150°C, are served well by neodymium–iro n–boron magnets. Substitution of neodymium– iron–boron for samarium–cobalt has been part icularly evident, for example, in computer peripheral drives, personal stereos, cam era motors, and compact disc players. In automotive applications needing the use of permanent magnets, either ferrites (for their low cost) or Alnico magnets (for their temp erature stability) have been used to date. The development of cost-effective, hot-pr essed neodymium–iron–boron magnets has made possible a reassessment of the benefits of a change over to smaller and lighter, albeit more expensive, magnets on the basis of im proved total system performance and cost. For example, the replacement of the wound field st ator in the starter motor by a permanent magnetic field brings down the load on the battery and the alternator, permitting them to be smaller and thus cheaper. A potentially voluminous market for neod ymium–iron–boron magnets is in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tomography, both in whole-body scanners and in smaller systems. Ferrites would give the cheapest mean s of generating a permanent magnetic field, but the weight (~100 tonnes for a whole body magnet) of material renders them unsuitable for many applications. Although more ex pensive, neodymium–iron–boron magnet systems are much lighter and more compact and, in some circumstances, can even compete with superconducting solenoids in producing the required magnetic fields. A forecast has been made that MRI scanners may become as commonplace as x-ray scanners in the course of the next decade, and many of these ar e likely to contain neodymium–iron–boron magnets. The development of neodymium–iron–boron magnets is having a widespread impact on the way permanent magnets are used, becau se they offer the very high strength of samarium–cobalt magnets at much lower co sts and without the prospect of supply limitations. Most of the next decade’s growth in permanent magnets will be inneodymium–iron–boron magnets, much of wh ich will be supplied as polymer-bonded and hot-pressed magnets. The search for new permanent magnet materials has led to furtherinterest in rare earth–iron intermetallic co mpounds modified by the introduction of interstitials such as nitrogen or carbon. Inte rstitial modification results in an expansion of the lattice, an enhancement of the Curie temper ature, and, in some alloys, the development of a strong uniaxial anisotropy. 07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 446 7.6 METHODS OF PREPARING ELEMENTAL AND COMPOUND FORMS OF RARE EARTHS The final part of this chapter will give an account of the different methods by which the rare earths are prepared in their elemental form s from their different compounds. There are principally three methods, the metallothermic , the electrolytic, and the lanthanothermic (Figure 7.6), which are usually adopted. The metallothermic method is used to prep are the light lanthanide metals, lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr) and ne odymium (Nd). The reductant normally used is calcium. Rare earth fluorides serve as the source. Presently rare earth fluorides are made by various methods. Conventionally these can be divided into two main groups. The first group comprises methods based on the precipitati on of fluorides from soluble salts of the corresponding metals by hydrofluoric acid (a queous methods) followed by thermal decom- position of the hydrated fluorides until an an hydrous state is reached. The second group, called dry, gaseous, or nonaqueous methods, comprises methods based on direct fluorid- izing (by hydrogen fluoride, fluorine, or ot her fluorinating agents). These methods have several important advantages compared with the aqueous methods: the fluorides obtained are anhydrous; the operations involving fluori de precipitation, washing, decantation, and filtration are bypassed as well as the drying and calcination of the fl uoride. The calcination process is, of course, associated with pyrohyd rolysis. The products obtained by precipi- tation are inferior to those obtained by nonaqu eous means. Both groups of methods are used in world production practices. Nevertheless, the method of gaseous hydrofluorination is Figure 7.6 Different metallurgical processes for producing rare earths in their metallic forms.07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMA SOJOURN IN THE WORLD OF RARE EARTHS 447 preferable. In all nonaqueous processes the star ting materials are rare earth oxides, which interact with gaseous hydrogen fluoride. Th e starting materials, i.e., the oxides, are produced by the thermal decomposition of carbo nates, hydroxides, oxalates, and so on. One of the best equipment to implement thermal decomposition is a ho rizontal ring-shaped vibrating apparatus with direct heating. The rare earth fluorides are synthesized by the reaction of rare earth oxides with hydrogen fl uoride at 200–550°C in a single continuous operation: (RE)2O3 + 6HF → 2(RE)F3 + 3H2O. Hafnium (HF) is preferred over NH4HF2 as a fluorinating agent since with the former th ere is less residual oxygen in the resultant fluoride. The latter, moreover, introduces so me iron into the fluoride, which eventually reports to the metal. For obtaining fluorides w ith the lowest oxygen content it is necessary to melt them under a HF gas cover before the reduction step. Every stage of production and processing of fluorides involves the use of pl atinum wares. Fluorides thus prepared are mixed with 10% excess calcium metal and charge d into a tantalum crucible, which is then heated inductively to about 1400°C or to a temperature that is about 100°C above the lanthanide metal’s melting point, whichever is higher. The denser lanthanide metal settles to the bottom, and the calcium fluoride slag fl oats on top of it. The slag is easily removed at room temperature and the metal is then vacuum cast at 1000–1200°C to remove the excess calcium. For obtaining metals of the highest purity, freshly prepared, multiple distilled calcium is used as the reductant, an d the vacuum casting is implemented at a much higher temperature (about 1800°C). The high vacuum casting temperature, however, causes the lanthanide metals to dissolve signif icant amounts of tantalum, but if the sample is slowly cooled and maintained just above it s melting point, most of the dissolved tantalum precipitates along the tantalum crucible wall. The high-tantalum zone in the peripheralregions of the ingot is machined off, leaving behind the essentially tantalum free lanthanide metal. Other variations of this process involv e the use of chloride intermediates instead of fluorides and the substitution of lithium for calcium as the reductant. The chloride inter- mediates bear the disadvantage of being hygr oscopic. The fluoride intermediates do not suffer from this drawback. A literature survey would provide the readers with a few other variations, but the route involving fluoride–cal cium interaction continues to be one of the most universally chosen metallurgical routes. The metallothermic means of the preparatio n of the light lanthanides described above is also used for the preparation of the heav y lanthanides and of yttrium. There exists, however, one difference in that the high te mperature vacuum casting operation is replaced by vacuum distillation or sublimation. Due to the fact that the heavy lanthanides show appreciable tendencies for dissolving tantalum ev en at the melting point, it is important that these metals are distilled. The electrolytic method is the exclusive choice for the light lanthanides, using chloride, fluoride, or oxide. For the reduction of the oxide, a complex fluoride solvent, which dissolves about 5% of the oxide at th e operating temperature, is used. The electro- lytic cell walls are usually constructed of ceram ic (e.g., firebrick) or graphite or molyb- denum; the anode is made of graphite and the cathode of iron or molybdenum or tungsten. The choice of material is governed by the purity desired for the final product. Typical operating conditions are a temperature of 800–1000°C, a high current (200 to 2500 A), avoltage of 4 to 15 V, and a cu rrent density of 2 to 10 A/cm The advantage of the electro- lytic method over the metallothermic one is that the lanthanide metal can be produced at a much lower cost. In general, the purities of th e electrolytically produced metals are inferior to those of the metallothermically produ ced ones, although in principle it should be possible to produce high purity metals el ectrolytically. A limitation of the electrolytic07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 448 method is that it cannot be (o r at least, to date, it has not been) deployed to produce heavy lanthanides in their pure forms. The primary r eason for this is that the cell and electrode Figure 7.7 Different metallurgical processes combined to produce rare earth-based alloy system. 07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMA SOJOURN IN THE WORLD OF RARE EARTHS 449 materials are not capable of withstanding the high temperatures needed because of the high melting points of the heavy lanthanides. Besides the light lanthanides, there is one more product, called misch metal, that is produced by the electrolytic method. In orde r to keep the production price low, the cells and the electrodes are constructed of the cheap est workable materials. In general, the quality of the misch metal produced is 98% or le ss pure. In part, this is due to the addition of magnesium to reduce the oxidation of misch metal at room temperature. The misch metal also contains appreciable amounts of other metallic impurities such as iron, aluminum, silicon and lead. Some of these impurities are fro m the original chloride used as the starting material, and the remainder are introduced du ring the metal reduction process. Since the primary use of misch metal is as an alloying agent or as lighter flints, the relatively high impurity contents do not appear to be a major deterrent for the process to be adopted in the industry. However, in specific applicatio ns such as misch metal ordnance devices (projectile liners), the influence of impurities is much more critical. Strictly speaking, the third method shoul d be known as a metallothermic method; however, in view of the special features involv ed, a special name is given to it. It is called the lanthanothermic method, named after the reductant, lanthanum (La), used in the process. The physicochemical principles of th e process are very similar to the well-known Pidgeon process for the production of ma gnesium, involving vacuothermal reduction of calcined dolomite with ferrosilicon as the reduct ant. Like magnesium metal, the rare earths elements samarium (Sm), europium (Eu), thul ium (Tm), and ytterbium (Yb) have relatively high vapor pressures. The reductant used is lanthanum. It has a low vapor pressure, which permits its use to perform this duty. It is an illustration of the use of one rare earth to produce a select group of rare earths. The pr ocess is implemented by mixing oxides of Sm, Eu, Tm, or Yb with lanthanum chips and load ing the mixture into what may be called a tantalum distillation containe r. The mixture is heated and lanthanum reduces the rare earth oxide. At the temperature used in the reduction process, the rare earth metal that is yielded has a very high vapor pressure. It evaporates, leaving the reaction site , and thus the reaction is driven to completion. The oxi de of lanthanum is left behind. The volatile rare earth metal is usually subjected to redistillation for acco mplishing further purification. Although other reactive metals with high boiling points su ch as cerium, zirconium, and thorium can be utilized, lanthanum is the more popular an d the classically accepted reductant in the metallurgical preparation of the particular gr oup of rare earth metals with which we have been concerned. It will be of interest to have a look at Fi gure 7.7 which shows, in essence, the various methods adopted to produce an industrially important rare earth-based alloy system. 7.7 CONCLUSION The rare earths industry is one of the most fascinating and challenging industries in the world. The industry is a fast moving one that is regularly sh aken up by swings in supply and demand and the appearance of new applications . China, at present, is by far the largest producer and exporter of all kinds of rare ear ths products; it is al so the second largest consumer of the rare earths in the world. At present about 75% of the rare earths consumed in the world originate in China. China will continue to dominate the supply of the rare earths in the international market in the futu re. Information about the rare earths in China07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMEXTRACTIVE METALLURGY OF RARE EARTHS 450 is disseminated by China Rare Earths Inform ation, an important organization located in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, P.R. China. This re gion in China is reputed to be endowed with exceptionally rich resources of the rare earth s and to have the necessary infrastructure for rare earths products development. At the pr esent time, challenges facing the Chinese production of the rare earths include limited funds, marketing/distribution arrangements, and preference for domestic production equipment. In the future, attention will be focused on ne w rare earth materials that will be in phase with the rapid growth and development of hi-tech industries, especially information technology. Among the emerging rare earths ma terials, the potential of sulfides as good candidates for plastic colorati on represents a very striking example of new developments as regards the uses of rare earths compounds. It may be mentioned in this context that very few yellow to red inorganic pigments are in use at present besides cadmium sulfoselenides and lead molybdates. Organic substitutes have limitations such as those pertaining to thermal stability and ultraviolet stability. Co ncerted research has gone into the develop- ment of red pigments for plastic coloration ba sed on safe materials, and in this respect the rare earths have a considerable advantage si nce they are nontoxic elements. The choice of a rare earth sulfide matrix is a consequence of its desirable intrinsic optical properties. In this context it is important that one recognizes and accepts the fact that the path can often be a long one before such intrinsic proper ties can be made amenable for commercial exploitation, eventually leadin g to large scale applications. This concluding chapter, which has captured in one shot a portrait of the rare earths may be brought to conclusion with a final sa lutation to these fantastic elements. They are in the limelight today and hold the promise of co ntinuing to be so in the days to come. The prevailing status and the projected future of the rare earths are all due to their special properties, which can be put to good use in th e service of humankind. Rare earth magnetic materials, rare earth hydrogen storage material s, rare earth phosphors, rare earth magneto- strictive materials, rare earth magnetic refrige ration materials, the applications of the rare earths in agriculture and in low energy li ghting, and some others have already made significant progress. The emergence of neodymium–iron–boron (Nd2Fe14B) magnets, for example, has resulted in a dramatic improvement in permanent magnet performance because these magnets have a magnetic energy product up to an order of magnitude higher than those of Alnico and ferrite magnets. Let us all, belonging to different institutions and organizations the world over, join to work with a common goal to make the rare earths dream come true. This sojourn, starting with an introducti on to mineralogy, occurrences and resources processing, then moving to applications alon g with a general description with regard to polishing powders, and finally to extraction, wi th the text sequence diverted at some point to deal generally with radiation, all interwoven into one presentation, should prove to be as interesting and enjoyable to the reader s as it has been to the authors. 07 Chapter 7 427-450. fm Monday, No vember 8, 2004 12:47 PMReferences Aamland, E., MacDonald, D.J., and Kerterke, D.G.
